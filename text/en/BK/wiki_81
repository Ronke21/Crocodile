<text>Edward Jean Steichen (March 27, 1879 – March 25, 1973) was a Luxembourgish American photographer, painter and curator and a pioneer of fashion photography. His gown images for the magazine &quot;Art et Décoration&quot; in 1911 were the first modern fashion photographs to be published. From 1923 to 1938, Steichen served as chief photographer for the Condé Nast magazines &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, while also working for many advertising agencies, including J. Walter Thompson. During these years, Steichen was regarded as the most popular and highest-paid photographer in the world.

After the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, Steichen was invited by the United States Navy to serve as Director of the Naval Aviation Photographic Unit. In 1944, he directed the war documentary &quot;The Fighting Lady&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 17th Academy Awards.

From 1947 to 1961, Steichen served as Director of the Department of Photography at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art. While there, he curated and assembled exhibits including the touring exhibition &quot;The Family of Man&quot;, which was seen by nine million people. In 2003, the &quot;Family of Man&quot; photographic collection was added to UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register in recognition of its historical value.

In February 2006, a print of Steichen&#x27;s early pictorialist photograph, &quot;The Pond–Moonlight&quot; (1904), sold for US$2.9 million—at the time, the highest price ever paid for a photograph at auction. A print of another photograph of the same style, &quot;The Flatiron&quot; (1904), became the second most expensive photograph ever on November 8, 2022, when it was sold for $12,000,000, at Christie&#x27;s New York – well above the original estimate of $2,000,000-$3,000,000.

==Early life==
Steichen was born Éduard Jean Steichen on March 27, 1879, in a small house in the village of Bivange, Luxembourg, the son of Jean-Pierre and Marie Kemp Steichen. His parents facing increasingly straitened circumstances and financial difficulties, decided to make a new start and emigrated to the United States when Steichen was eighteen months old. Jean-Pierre Steichen immigrated in 1880, with Marie Steichen bringing the infant Éduard along after Jean-Pierre had settled in Hancock in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula copper country. According to noted Steichen biographer, Penelope Niven, the Steichens were &quot;part of a large exodus of Luxembourgers displaced in the late nineteenth century by worsening economic conditions.&quot;

Éduard&#x27;s sister and only sibling, Lilian Steichen, was born in Hancock on May 1, 1883. She would later marry poet Carl Sandburg, whom she met at the Milwaukee Social Democratic Party office in 1907. Her marriage to Sandburg the following year helped forge a life-long friendship and partnership between her brother and Sandburg.

By 1889, when Éduard was 10, his parents had saved up enough money to move the family to Milwaukee. There he learned German and English at school, while continuing to speak Luxembourgish at home.

In 1894, at fifteen, Steichen began attending Pio Nono College, a Catholic boys&#x27; high school, where his artistic talents were noticed. His drawings in particular were said to show promise. He quit high school to begin a four-year lithography apprenticeship with the American Fine Art Company of Milwaukee. After hours, he would sketch and draw, and he began to teach himself painting. Having discovered a camera shop near his work, he visited frequently until he persuaded himself to buy his first camera, a secondhand Kodak box &quot;detective&quot; camera, in 1895. Steichen and his friends who were also interested in drawing and photography pooled their funds, rented a small room in a Milwaukee, WI office building, and began calling themselves the Milwaukee Art Students League. The group hired Richard Lorenz and Robert Schade for occasional lectures. In 1899, Steichen&#x27;s photographs were exhibited in the second Philadelphia Photographic Salon.

Steichen became a U.S. citizen in 1900 and signed the naturalization papers as Edward J. Steichen, but he continued to use his birth name of Éduard until after the First World War.

==Career==
===Paris, New York, and Partnerships with Stieglitz and Rodin===

In April 1900, Steichen left Milwaukee for Paris to study art. Clarence H. White thought Steichen and Alfred Stieglitz should meet, and thus produced an introduction letter for Steichen, and Steichen—then &quot;en route&quot; to Paris from his home in Milwaukee—met Stieglitz in New York City in early 1900. In that first meeting, Stieglitz expressed praise for Steichen&#x27;s background in painting and bought three of Steichen&#x27;s photographic prints.

In 1902, when Stieglitz was formulating what would become &quot;Camera Work&quot;, he asked Steichen to design the logo for the magazine with a custom typeface. Steichen was the most frequently shown photographer in the journal.

Steichen began experimenting with color photography in 1904 and was one of the earliest in the United States to use the Autochrome Lumière process. In 1905, Stieglitz and Steichen created the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession, in what had been Steichen&#x27;s portrait studio; it eventually became known as the 291 Gallery after its address. It presented some of the first American exhibitions of Auguste Rodin, Henri Matisse, Paul Cézanne, Pablo Picasso, and Constantin Brâncuși.

According to author and art historian William A. Ewing, Steichen became one of the earliest &quot;jet setters&quot;, constantly moving back and forth between Europe and the U.S. by steamship, in the process cross-pollinating art from Europe to the United States, helping to define photography as an art form, and at the same time widening America&#x27;s understanding of European art and art in general.

===Pioneering fashion photography===
Fashion photography began with engravings reproduced from photographs of modishly-dressed actresses by Leopold-Emile Reutlinger, Nadar and others in the 1890s. After high-quality half-tone reproduction of photographs became possible, most credit as pioneers of the genre goes to the French Baron Adolph de Meyer and to Steichen who, borrowing his friend&#x27;s hand-camera in 1907, candidly photographed dazzlingly-dressed ladies at the Longchamp Racecourse Fashion then was being photographed for newspaper supplements and fashion magazines, particularly by the Frères Séeberger, as it was worn at Paris horse-race meetings by aristocracy and hired models.

In 1911, Lucien Vogel, the publisher of &quot;Jardin des Modes&quot; and &quot;La Gazette du Bon Ton&quot;, challenged Steichen to promote fashion as a fine art through photography. Steichen took photos of gowns designed by &quot;couturier&quot; Paul Poiret, which were published in the April 1911 issue of the magazine &quot;Art et Décoration.&quot; Two were in colour, and appeared next to flat, stylised, yellow-and-black Georges Lepape drawings of accessories, fabrics, and girls.

Steichen himself, in his 1963 autobiography, asserted that his 1911 &quot;Art et Décoration&quot; photographs &quot;were probably the first serious fashion photographs ever made,&quot; a generalised claim since repeated by many commentators. What he (and de Meyer) did bring was an artistic approach; a soft-focus, aesthetically retouched Pictorialist style that was distinct from the mechanically sharp images made by his commercial colleagues for half-tone reproduction, and that he and the publishers and fashion designers for whom he worked appreciated as a marketable idealisation of the garment, beyond the exact description of fabrics and buttonholes.

After World War I, during which he commanded the photographic division of the American Expeditionary Forces, he gradually reverted to straight photography. In the early 1920s, Steichen famously took over 1000 photographs of a single cup and saucer, on &quot;a graduated scale of tones from pure white through light and dark greys to black velvet,&quot; which he compared to the a musician&#x27;s finger exercises. He was hired by Condé Nast in 1923 for the extraordinary salary of $35,000 (equivalent to over $500,000 in 2019 value).

===World War II===

At the commencement of World War II, Steichen, then in his sixties, had retired as a full-time photographer. He was developing new varieties of delphinium, which in 1936 had been the subject of his first exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, and the only flower exhibition ever held there.

When the United States joined the global conflict, Steichen, who had come out of the first World War an Army Colonel, was refused for active service because of his age. Later, invited by the Navy to serve as Director of the Naval Aviation Photographic Unit, he was commissioned a Lieutenant-Commander in January 1942. Steichen selected for his unit six officer-photographers from the industry (sometimes irreverently called &quot;Steichen&#x27;s chickens&quot;), including photographers Wayne Miller and Charles Fenno Jacobs. A collection of 172 silver gelatin photographs taken by the Unit under his leadership is held at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Their war documentary &quot;The Fighting Lady,&quot; directed by Steichen, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 17th Academy Awards.

In 1942, Steichen curated for the Museum of Modern Art the exhibition &quot;Road to Victory,&quot; five duplicates of which toured the world. Photographs in the exhibition were credited to enlisted members of the Navy, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps and numbers by Steichen&#x27;s unit, while many were anonymous and some were made by automatic cameras in Navy planes operated while firing at the enemy. This was followed in January 1945 by &quot;Power in the Pacific: Battle Photographs of our Navy in Action on the Sea and In the Sky.&quot; Steichen was released from Active Duty (under honorable conditions) on December 13, 1945, at the rank of Captain. For his service during World War II, he was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with 2 campaign stars), American Campaign Medal, and numerous other awards.

===Museum of Modern Art===
In the summer of 1929, Museum of Modern Art director Alfred H. Barr, Jr. had included a department devoted to photography in a plan presented to the Trustees. Though not put in place until 1940, it became the first department of photography in a museum devoted to twentieth-century art and was headed by Beaumont Newhall. On the strength of attendances of his propaganda exhibitions &quot;Road to Victory&quot; and &quot;Power in the Pacific&quot;, and precipitating curator Newhall&#x27;s resignation along with most of his staff, in 1947 Steichen was appointed Director of Photography until 1962, later assisted by Grace M. Mayer.

His appointment was protested by many who saw him as anti-art photography, one of the most vocal being Ansel Adams who on April 29, 1946, wrote a letter to Stephen Clark (copied to Newhall) to express his disappointment over Steichen&#x27;s hiring for the new position of director; &quot;To supplant Beaumont Newhall, who has made such a great contribution to the art through his vast knowledge and sympathy for the medium, with a regime which is inevitably favorable to the spectacular and &#x27;popular&#x27; is indeed a body blow to the progress of creative photography.&quot;

Nevertheless, Ansel Adams&#x27; image &quot;Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico&quot; was first published in &quot;U.S. Camera Annual 1943&quot;, after being selected by Steichen, who was serving as judge for the publication. This gave &quot;Moonrise&quot; an audience before its first formal exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1944.

Steichen as director held a strong belief in the local product, of the &quot;liveness of the melting pot of American photography,&quot; and worked to expand and organise the collection, inspiring and recognising the 1950s generation while keeping historical shows to a minimum. He worked with Robert Frank even before his &quot;The Americans&quot; was published, exhibited the early work of Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind, and purchased two prints by Robert Rauschenberg in 1952, ahead of any museum. Steichen also kept international developments in his scope and held shows and made important acquisitions from Europe and Latin America, occasionally visiting those countries to do so. Three books were published by the Department during his tenure (&quot;The Family of Man&quot;, &quot;Steichen the Photographer&quot;, and &quot;The Bitter Years: 1935–1941: Rural America as Seen by the Photographers of the Farm Security Administration&quot;). Despite his solid career in photography, Steichen displayed his own work at MoMA—his retrospective, &quot;Steichen the Photographer&quot;—only after he had already announced his retirement in 1961.
Among accomplishments that were to redeem initial resentment at his appointment, Steichen created &quot;The Family of Man&quot;, a world-touring Museum of Modern Art exhibition that, while arguably a product of American Cold War propaganda, was seen by 9 million visitors and still holds the record for most-visited photography exhibit. Now permanently housed and on continuous display in Clervaux (Luxembourgish: Klierf) Castle in northern Luxembourg, his country of birth, Steichen regarded the exhibition as the &quot;culmination of his career.&quot;. Comprising over 500 photos that depicted life, love and death in 68 countries, the prologue for its widely purchased catalogue was written by Steichen&#x27;s brother-in-law, Carl Sandburg. As had been Steichen&#x27;s wish, the exhibition was donated to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, his country of birth.

In the latter years of his tenure after her appointment by Steichen as Assistant Curator, it was Grace M. Mayer from the Museum of the City of New York, where she had organized about 150 exhibitions, who curated the shows &quot;The Sense of Abstraction&quot; (17 Feb–10 Apr 1960), co-directed by Kathleen Haven, the museum staff designer since 1955. Then Mayer organized Steichens only solo-show during his time at the museum, &quot;Steichen the Photographer,&quot; (28 Mar–30 May 1961), &quot;Diogenes with a Camera V&quot; (26 Sep–12 Nov 1961), &quot;50 Photographs by 50 Photographers,&quot; a third survey of the museum&#x27;s collection (3 Apr–15 May 1962), and a series of four installations called &quot;A Bid for Space&quot; (1960 to 1963), which were designed by Kathleen Haven. Haven had also been responsible for the design of &quot;The Family of Man,&quot; she worked two years on, as well as &quot;Diogenes with a Camera&quot; (II, III and IV), the exhibition of Brassaï&#x27;s graffiti photographs, and the 1958 collection survey.

Steichen hired John Szarkowski to be his successor at the Museum of Modern Art on July 1, 1962. On his appointment, Szarkowski promoted Mayer to Curator.

==Later life==
On December 6, 1963, Steichen was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.

Though then 88 years old and unable to attend in person, in 1967 Steichen, as a still-active member of the copyright committee of the American Society of Magazine Photographers, wrote a submission to the U.S. Senate hearings to support copyright law revisions, requesting that &quot;this young giant among the visual arts be given equal rights by having its peculiar problems taken into account.&quot;

In 1968, the Edward Steichen Archive was established in MoMA&#x27;s Department of Photography. The Museum&#x27;s then-Director René d&#x27;Harnoncourt declared that its function was to &quot;amplify and clarify the meaning of Steichen&#x27;s contribution to the art of photography, and to modern art generally.&quot; Creator of the Archive was Grace M. Mayer, who in 1959 started her career as an assistant to the director, Steichen, and who became Curator of Photography in 1962, retiring in 1968. Mayer returned after her retirement to serve in a voluntary capacity as Curator of the Edward Steichen Archive until the mid-1980s to source materials by, about, and related to Steichen. Her detailed card catalogs are housed in the Museum&#x27;s Grace M. Mayer Papers.

Steichen&#x27;s 90th birthday was marked with a dinner gathering of photographers, editors, writers, and museum professionals at the Plaza Hotel in 1969. The event was hosted by MoMA trustee Henry Allen Moe, and &quot;U.S. Camera&quot; magazine publisher Tom Maloney.

In 1970, an evening show was presented in Arles during The Rencontres d&#x27;Arles festival: &quot;Edward Steichen, photographe&quot; by Martin Boschet.

Steichen bought a farm that he called Umpawaug in 1928, just outside West Redding, Connecticut. He lived there until his death on March 25, 1973, two days before his 94th birthday. After his death, Steichen&#x27;s farm was made into a park, known as Topstone Park. As of 2018, Topstone Park was open seasonally.

==Legacy==


Steichen&#x27;s career, especially his activities at MoMA, did much to popularise and promote the medium, and both before and since his death photography, including his own, continued to appreciate as a collectible art form.

In February 2006, a print of Steichen&#x27;s early pictorialist photograph, &quot;The Pond–Moonlight&quot; (1904), sold for what was then the highest price ever paid for a photograph at auction, .

Steichen took the photograph in Mamaroneck, New York, near the home of his friend, art critic Charles Caffin. It shows a wooded area and pond, with moonlight appearing between the trees and reflecting on the pond. While the print appears to be a color photograph, the first true color photographic process, the autochrome process, was not available until 1907. Steichen created the impression of color by manually applying layers of light-sensitive gums to the paper. Only three prints of &quot;The Pond–Moonlight&quot; are still known to exist and, as a result of the hand-layering of the gums, each is unique. (The two prints not auctioned are held in museum collections.) The extraordinary sale price of the print is in part attributable to its one-of-a-kind character and to its rarity.

A show of early color photographs by Steichen was held at the Mudam (Musée d&#x27;Art moderne) in Luxembourg City from July 14 to September 3, 2007.

==Personal life==
Steichen married Clara E. Smith (1875–1952) in 1903. They had two daughters, Mary Rose Steichen (1904-1998) and Charlotte &quot;Kate&quot; Rodina Steichen (1908-1988). In 1914, Clara accused her husband of having an affair with artist Marion H. Beckett, who was staying with them in France. The Steichens left France just ahead of invading German troops. In 1915, Clara Steichen returned to France with her daughter Kate, staying in their house in the Marne in spite of the war. Steichen returned to France with the Photography Division of the American Army Signal Corps in 1917, whereupon Clara returned to the United States. In 1919, Clara Steichen sued Marion Beckett for having an affair with her husband, but was unable to prove her claims. Clara and Edward Steichen eventually divorced in 1922.

Steichen married Dana Desboro Glover in 1923. She died of leukemia in 1957.

In 1960, aged 80, Steichen married 27-year-old Joanna Taub and remained married to her until his death, two days before his 94th birthday. Joanna Steichen died on July 24, 2010, in Montauk, New York, aged 77.

<doc id="389903" wikidata="Q24" url="?curid=389903" title="Jack Bauer">
<text>Jack Bauer is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Fox television series &quot;24&quot;. Throughout the majority of the series&#x27; running, Bauer serves as a key member of the fictional CTU and other institutions. Bauer&#x27;s job usually involves helping prevent major terrorist attacks on the United States, saving both civilian lives and government administrations. On many occasions, Jack does so at great personal expense, as those he thwarts subsequently target him and his loved ones. Bauer is not a crooked agent; though his frequent use of torture to gather information has generated much controversy and discussion.

Actor Kiefer Sutherland portrays Jack Bauer in the television show and video game. The television series was originally set to end on May 24, 2010, after eight successful seasons but was revived for a limited ninth season, which premiered on May 5, 2014. A feature film was set to be released; however, discussions ended over a contract dispute with Fox.

Bauer has received critical acclaim from audiences and critics. TV Guide ranked him No. 49 on their list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Top 50 Heroes&quot; and Sky 1 listed Jack as No. 1 on their list of
&quot;TV&#x27;s toughest men&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Jack Bauer one of &quot;The 20 All Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture&quot;. In June 2010, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also named him one of the &quot;100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years&quot;. Jack is also the only character in the show to have appeared in all episodes.

==Concept and creation==
&quot;24&quot; co-creator Joel Surnow commented that they did not have any actors in mind for the part; &quot;We didn&#x27;t really know who it was. We were casting a lot of people and then we heard Kiefer Sutherland&#x27;s name and thought, that&#x27;s Jack Bauer.&quot; In 2000, Sutherland was contacted by his friend, director Stephen Hopkins, who was working on the pilot for the experimental real-time TV show and offered him the lead. Initially Sutherland had reservations about playing Bauer, stating, &quot;I thought, &#x27;This is really clever and different, so there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;re going to pick it up. But I could use the money, and no one will ever see it&#x27;.&quot;

Sutherland must produce around 24 hours of film each season, &quot;which is like making 12 movies, so there are going to be mistakes along the way, but I am incredibly surprised by how many things work well as a result of working at that pace.&quot;
In 2006, Sutherland signed a contract to play the role of Bauer for three seasons following season five. The contract was reported to be worth $40 million. Sutherland is also an executive producer of &quot;24&quot;.

==Characterization==
Jack Bauer was born in Santa Monica, California, on February 18, 1966, to Phillip Bauer, who placed his livelihood in his company, BXJ Technologies. The name of Jack&#x27;s mother is unknown. Jack had one brother, Graem Bauer. Phillip originally planned to give the company to Jack, but as Jack said in Day 6, &quot;I just had to go my own way.&quot;

Jack has a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature from the University of California, Los Angeles and a Master of Science degree in Criminology and Law from the University of California, Berkeley. He enlisted in the United States Army and later graduated from Officer Candidate School. His branch was infantry. He first served in the Special Forces, and was later a member of the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1st SFOD-D), popularly known as Delta Force. Among his awards and decorations are the Silver Star, the Purple Heart, and the Legion of Merit. Apart from Special Forces and Delta training, he received Airborne, Air Assault, and Ranger training. He left the Army with the rank of Captain after twelve years of service.

While in the Army, he married Teri Bauer and had one child, Kim Bauer. Following his military career, Jack worked for both the Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s Special Weapons and Tactics unit and for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a Case Officer in the National Clandestine Service. He was recruited into the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) by Christopher Henderson, CTU&#x27;s Director of Field Operations.

Bauer has shown a high proficiency with firearms (typically using a SIG P228 as his weapon of choice for the first and second seasons, then switching to a USP Compact, until after Season 8 he switches again, this time to a P30). He also can handle explosives and electronic devices, and has a high resistance to torture (after being kidnapped by Chinese agents and tortured for almost two years, it is revealed he didn&#x27;t speak a single word the whole time). He is fluent in German (Season 8) and has demonstrated some ability to either speak or understand Spanish (Seasons 1 and 3), Serbian (Season 1), Russian (Season 6), and Arabic (Season 8). He is also shown to be capable of flying planes (Season 2) and helicopters (Seasons 3, 5, 8, and 9). Jack is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant from his years in the Army and as a federal agent, and he has killed multiple enemies in hand-to-hand combat.

Bauer generally wishes to live a humble life, but is willing to step forward and protect his country, even at the expense of his own health. His involvement throughout the show had caused him to lose many of his loved ones, despite his leadership and own calls. While the government acknowledges his service, Bauer and his superiors clash over his more rogue and extreme actions he takes without explicit authorization.

Jack has lost his wife Teri, murdered by a traitor who had infiltrated CTU. His relationship with his daughter Kim is at times tumultuous (Season 2, Season 5) while at other times accepting of who he is and what he must do (Season 7, Season 8). In his goal to find peace, he gets involved with Audrey Raines, the daughter of United States Secretary of Defense James Heller, whom Jack works for. The relationship with the Secretary&#x27;s daughter is all but severed when Jack makes the decision to save a material witness over Audrey&#x27;s ex-husband. He lost his best friend, Tony Almeida, and former boss, Michelle, to a car bomb. He lost his friend, former President David Palmer, to the same assassin who killed his friends. His girlfriend \ Renee Walker was killed by an assassin&#x27;s bullet. His own government that he has sworn to protect has turned on him (former President Logan, President Taylor), and at the beginning of Season 7 he is on trial for his interrogation tactics. Finally, the friend he thought was dead (Tony Almeida), betrays him when he turns to terrorism in order to seek revenge against the person who killed his wife, Michelle.

Jack&#x27;s final dialogue with FBI Special Agent Renee Walker in Season 7 offers insight into his perspective on torture and its ramifications:
==In other media==
As the principal character in 24, Jack plays a prominent role in the television series as well as the video game. Jack is the lead protagonist of the 24 series and the books, and has appeared in every episode to date. Kiefer Sutherland has portrayed Jack Bauer in these episodes, including the &quot;prequels&quot; and the &quot;webisodes&quot;. Additionally, he voiced the same character in &quot;24: The Game&quot;, &quot;24: Day Zero&quot; and &quot;24: DVD Board Game&quot;.

===24 Prequels===
Jack Bauer is also featured in all four prequels, that can be found on the 24 DVD releases and various websites. These prequels are designed to bridge the gap between seasons. They provide backstory into story arcs for upcoming seasons, namely insight into what Jack&#x27;s actions have been leading up to the next season. Prequels have been made for Seasons 4, 5, 6, and 7.

===24 Webisodes===
24: Day 6 Debrief takes place 35 hours after the nuclear device exploded in Valencia, California. The series consists of 5 segments, no longer than three minutes in length each. Two agents, Agent Ramirez and Agent Moss, track Jack down to a hotel room and ask him to come to District for debriefing about the recovery of the tactical nukes. The Debrief consists of Agent Ramirez and other agents attempting to discover more about the supposed-death of an undercover agent, Marcus Holt, who disappeared shortly after Jack&#x27;s imprisonment in China at the hands of Cheng Zhi. Since Holt was involved with the Chinese government, it is believed that Jack leaked information that led to his identity being discovered and execution. At the end of the series, the agents announce that they have no conclusive evidence about his involvement, but Ramirez promises to keep a close eye on him until he is certain. Jack tells Ramirez that if he ever sees him again, he better say &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, because it will mean he&#x27;s come to kill him.

With that, Bauer is released from custody and the interrogation ends.

===24: The Game===

&quot;24: The Game&quot; takes place between Day 2 and 3. Jack begins waiting outside a ship where terrorists are going to release a ricin bomb in the water supply. A CTU Team triggers an alarm causing Jack and his team to storm the ship. Jack and his team find the whole ship&#x27;s crew dead in a cargo hold. He runs into Peter Madsen, an enemy from his past. It is unclear what the story is between them, but it is stated that he framed Jack&#x27;s family for a vile crime, this is hinted with Jack saying to him: &quot;Eight years ago, my family was not involved&quot;. Madsen also states that he no longer takes orders from Jack. It&#x27;s hinted that Madsen was under Jack&#x27;s command either in the army or in a SWAT team, and Madsen betrayed Jack. Madsen kidnaps Jack&#x27;s daughter Kim, and later Kate Warner. Jack finally kills Madsen near the end of the game when he tries to escape by shooting up his speedboat with a Zastava M80 assault rifle, causing it to explode. He also kills Max, who was holding Kate hostage, saving her life. However Max managed to shoot Jack once before dying, the second of two times he was shot in the final hour of the game, the first time by Madsen. As a result, Chase Edmunds takes Jack to the hospital via helicopter.

===The Trail to Oregon!===
In the version of the musical &quot;The Trail to Oregon!&quot; that was uploaded to YouTube by the official StarKid Productions YouTube channel, the Father is named &quot;&#x27;Jack Bauer&quot;, a name suggested by an audience member.

===&quot;The Office&quot;===
In &quot;The Job&quot;, the third-season finale of the American adaptation of &quot;The Office&quot;, Dwight Schrute wishes to name Jack Bauer his second-in-command, but laments that he is &quot;unavailable, fictional, and overqualified&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Having won an Emmy Award (with 5 other nominations), a Golden Globe (with 4 other nominations), two SAG Awards (with 3 other nominations) and two Satellite Awards, Kiefer Sutherland&#x27;s performance as Jack Bauer became (award-wise) the third most acclaimed Male Lead Dramatic TV performance of the 2000s behind James Gandolfini (with 3 Emmys, 1 Golden Globe and 3 SAG Awards) and Bryan Cranston (with 4 Emmys, 1 Golden Globe, 2 SAG Awards, and 4 Satellite Awards). He is also one of only two Male Lead Drama TV Actors ever to have won all 4 awards, the other being Bryan Cranston for his role as Walter White on &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put it on its end-of-the-decade, &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;When Kiefer Sutherland&#x27;s 24 superagent barks &quot;Dammit, Chloe—we&#x27;re running out of time!&quot; America&#x27;s ass is about to be saved in some new, heart-stopping way.&quot;

Some American politicians and lawyers have used Jack Bauer and his actions to frame the debate on American interrogation techniques (in this case, &quot;torture&quot;), which have become an object of intense controversy. As well, at a 2007 legal conference in Ottawa, Canada, Jack Bauer&#x27;s tactics were raised during a panel discussion about &quot;terrorism, torture and the law&quot;. Panel members, including U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, discussed the use of torture &quot;in times of great crisis&quot;. Scalia was quoted as saying: &quot;Jack Bauer saved Los Angeles. He saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Is any jury going to convict Jack Bauer? I don&#x27;t think so.&quot;

Several philosophers have used Jack Bauer&#x27;s character to settle challenging moral questions. Twenty philosophers contributed to a 2007 book, &quot;24 and Philosophy: The World According to Jack&quot;, which assesses Bauer through the eyes of famous philosophers. For the &quot;24: Live Another Day&quot; series, in which anti-hero Jack Bauer and anti-villain Margot Al-Harazi have similar ethical viewpoints, some philosophers have resorted to Iain King&#x27;s quasi-utilitarian approach to determine that Bauer is morally superior.

<doc id="389912" wikidata="Q959541" url="?curid=389912" title="Michael Oakeshott">
<text>Michael Joseph Oakeshott FBA (; 11 December 1901 – 19 December 1990) was an English philosopher and political theorist who wrote on the philosophies of history, religion, aesthetics, education, and law.

==Early life and education==
Oakeshott was born in Chelsfield, London, on 11 December 1901, the son of Joseph Francis Oakeshott, a civil servant with the Inland Revenue, and member of the Fabian Society, and Frances Maude, daughter of George Thistle Hellicar, a well-off Islington silk-merchant. Though there is no evidence that he knew her, he was related by marriage to the women&#x27;s rights activist Grace Oakeshott, and to the economist and social reformer Gilbert Slater.

Michael Oakeshott attended St George&#x27;s School, Harpenden, a new co-educational and &#x27;progressive&#x27; boarding school from 1912 to 1920. He enjoyed his schooldays, and the Headmaster, the Rev. Cecil Grant, a disciple of Maria Montessori, later became a friend. 

In 1920, Oakeshott matriculated with a Scholarship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read history, taking the Political Science options in both parts of the Tripos, the University of Cambridge&#x27;s degree examinations. He graduated in 1923 with a first-class degree, and subsequently received an unexamined M.A., and was elected a Fellow of Caius in 1925. 

As a University of Cambridge student, he admired the British idealist philosophers J. M. E. McTaggart and John Grote, and the medieval historian Zachary Nugent Brooke. He said that McTaggart&#x27;s introductory lectures were the only formal philosophical training he ever received. The historian Herbert Butterfield was a contemporary, friend and fellow member of the Junior Historians society.

After graduation in 1923, Oakeshott pursued theology and German literature in a summer course at the universities of Marburg and Tübingen, and again in 1925. In between, he taught literature for a year as Senior English Master at King Edward VII Grammar School, Lytham, while simultaneously writing his fellowship dissertation, which he said was a &#x27;dry run&#x27; for his first book, &quot;Experience and its Modes&quot;.

==Career==
Oakeshott was dismayed by the political extremism that occurred in Europe during the 1930s, and his surviving lectures from this period reveal a dislike of Nazism and Marxism. He is said to have been the first at Cambridge to lecture on Marx. At the suggestion of Sir Ernest Barker, who sought to see Oakeshott succeed to his own chair of political science at the University of Cambridge, he produced an anthology, with commentary, &quot;The Social and Political Doctrines of Contemporary Europe&quot;, published in 1939. For all its muddle and incoherence, as Oakeshott saw it, he found representative democracy the least unsatisfactory, in part because &quot;the imposition of a universal plan of life on a society is at once stupid and immoral.&quot;

===Second World War===
Oakeshott joined the British Army in 1940, before being conscripted under the National Service Act. He volunteered for the virtually suicidal Special Operations Executive (SOE), where the average life expectancy was about six weeks, and was interviewed by Hugh Trevor-Roper, who felt that he was &quot;too unmistakably English&quot; to conduct covert operations on the Continent. 

Oakeshott saw active service in Europe with the battlefield intelligence unit Phantom, a semi-freelance quasi-Signals organisation which also had connections with the Special Air Service (SAS). Though always at the front, the unit was seldom directly involved in any actual fighting. Oakeshott&#x27;s military competence did not go unnoticed, and he ended the war as Adjutant of Phantom&#x27;s &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron and an acting major.

===Postwar===
In 1945, Oakeshott was demobilised and returned to the University of Cambridge. In 1949, he left Cambridge for Nuffield College, Oxford, but after only two years, in 1951, he was appointed Professor of Political Science at the London School of Economics (LSE), succeeding the leftist Harold Laski, an appointment noted by the popular press. Oakeshott was deeply unsympathetic to the student activism at LSE during the late 1960s, and highly critical of what he saw as the authorities&#x27; insufficiently robust response. He retired from the LSE in 1969, but continued teaching and conducting seminars until 1980.

In his retirement, he retreated to live quietly in a country cottage in Langton Matravers in Dorset with his third wife. He was twice divorced and had numerous affairs, many of them with wives of his students, colleagues and friends, and even with his son Simon&#x27;s girlfriend. He also had a son out of wedlock, whom he abandoned together with the mother when the child was two, and whom he did not meet again for nearly twenty years. Oakeshott&#x27;s most famous lover was Iris Murdoch.

Oakeshott lived long enough to experience increasing recognition, although he has become much more widely written about since his death. Oakeshott declined an offer to be made a Companion of Honour, for which he was proposed by Margaret Thatcher.

== Philosophy ==

===Early works===

Oakeshott&#x27;s early work, some of which has been published posthumously as &quot;What is History? and Other Essays&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Concept of a Philosophical Jurisprudence&quot; (2007), shows that he was more interested in the philosophical problems that derived from his historical studies than he was in the history, even though he was officially a historian. Some of his very early essays are on religion (of a Christian &#x27;modernist&#x27; kind), though after his first marital break-up () he published no more on the topic except for a couple of pages in his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, titled &quot;On Human Conduct&quot;. However, his posthumously published and voluminous &quot;Notebooks&quot; (1919-) show a lifelong preoccupation with religion and questions of mortality. In his youth he had considered taking Holy Orders, but later inclined towards a non-specific Romantic mysticism.

===Philosophy and modes of experience===
Oakeshott published his first book in 1933, &quot;Experience and its Modes&quot;, when he was thirty-one. He acknowledged the influence of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and F. H. Bradley; commentators also noticed resemblances between this work and the ideas of thinkers such as R. G. Collingwood and Georg Simmel.

The book argued that our experience is usually modal, in the sense that we almost always have a governing perspective on the world, be it practical or theoretical. One may take various theoretical approaches to the world: natural science, history and practice, for example, are quite separate, immiscible modes of experience. It is a mistake, he declared, to treat history on the model of the sciences, or to read into it one&#x27;s current practical concerns.

Philosophy, however, is not a mode. At this stage of his career Oakeshott understood philosophy as the world seen, in Spinoza&#x27;s phrase, &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;under the aspect of eternity&quot;, free from presuppositions, whereas science and history and the practical mode rely on certain assumptions. Later (there is disagreement about exactly when) Oakeshott adopted a pluralistic view of the various modes of experience, with philosophy just one voice among others, though it retained its self-critical character.

According to Oakeshott, the dominating principles of scientific and historical thought are quantity (the world &#x27;) and pastness (the world &#x27;) respectively. Oakeshott distinguished the academic perspective on the past from the practical, in which the past is seen in terms of its relevance to our present and future. His insistence on the autonomy of history places him close to Collingwood, who also argued for the autonomy of historical knowledge.

The practical world view (the world &quot;&quot;) presupposes the ideas of will and value. It is only in terms of these that practical action, for example in politics, economics, and ethics, makes sense. Because all action is conditioned by presuppositions, Oakeshott saw any attempt to change the world as reliant upon a scale of values, which themselves presuppose a context in which &quot;this&quot; is preferable to &quot;that&quot;. Even the conservative disposition to maintain the &quot;status quo&quot; (so long as the latter is tolerable) relies upon managing inevitable change, a point he later elaborated in his essay &quot;On Being Conservative&quot;.

===Post-war essays===

During this period, Oakeshott published what became his best known work during his lifetime, the collection entitled &quot;Rationalism in Politics and Other Essays&quot; (1962), and notable for its elegance of style. Some of his near-polemics against the direction that Britain was taking, in particular towards socialism, gained Oakeshott a reputation as a traditionalist conservative, sceptical about rationalism and rigid ideologies. Bernard Crick described him as a &quot;lonely nihilist&quot;.

Oakeshott&#x27;s opposition to political utopianism is summed up in his analogy (possibly borrowed from a pamphlet by the 17th-century statesman George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax, &quot;The Character of a Trimmer&quot;) of a ship of state that has &quot;neither starting-place nor appointed destination...[and where] the enterprise is to keep afloat on an even keel&quot;. He was a severe critic of E. H. Carr, the Cambridge historian of Soviet Russia, claiming that Carr was fatally uncritical of the Bolshevik regime and took some of its propaganda at face value.

===&quot;On Human Conduct&quot; and Oakeshott&#x27;s political theory===
In his essay &quot;On Being Conservative&quot; (1956) Oakeshott characterised conservatism as a disposition rather than a political stance: &quot;To be conservative ... is to prefer the familiar to the unknown, to prefer the tried to the untried, fact to mystery, the actual to the possible, the limited to the unbounded, the near to the distant, the sufficient to the superabundant, the convenient to the perfect, present laughter to utopian bliss.&quot;

Oakeshott&#x27;s political philosophy, as advanced in &quot;On Human Conduct&quot; (1975), is free of any recognisable party politics. The book&#x27;s first part (&quot;On the Theoretical Understanding of Human Conduct&quot;) develops a theory of human action as the exercise of intelligent agency in activities such as wanting and choosing, the second (&quot;On the Civil Condition&quot;) discusses the formal conditions of association appropriate to such intelligent agents, described as &quot;civil&quot; or legal association, and the third (&quot;On the Character of a Modern European State&quot;) examines how far this understanding of human association has affected politics and political ideas in post-Renaissance European history.

Oakeshott suggests that there had been two major modes or understandings of political organization. In the first, which he calls &quot;enterprise association&quot; (or &#x27;), the state is (illegitimately) understood as imposing some universal purpose (profit, salvation, progress, racial domination) on its subjects. (As its name indicates, enterprise association is perfectly appropriate to the management of &quot;enterprises&quot;; however, except in emergencies such as war, where all resources must be commandeered into the pursuit of victory, the state is not an enterprise, properly so called.) By contrast, &quot;civil association&quot; (or &#x27;) is primarily a legal relationship in which laws impose obligatory conditions of action but do not require the associates to choose one action rather than another. (Compare Robert Nozick on &#x27;side-constraints&#x27;.)

The complex, technical and often rebarbative style of &quot;On Human Conduct&quot; found few readers, and its initial reception was mostly one of bafflement. Oakeshott, who rarely responded to critics, replied sardonically in &quot;Political Theory&quot; to some of the contributions made in a symposium on the book in the same journal.

In his posthumously published &quot;The Politics of Faith and the Politics of Scepticism&quot; Oakeshott describes enterprise associations and civil associations in different terms. In politics, an enterprise association is based on a fundamental faith in human ability to ascertain and grasp some universal good (leading to the Politics of Faith), and civil association is based on a fundamental scepticism about human ability to either ascertain or achieve this good (leading to the Politics of Scepticism). Oakeshott considers power (especially technological power) as a necessary prerequisite for the Politics of Faith, because it allows people to believe that they can achieve something great and to implement the policies necessary to achieve their goal. The Politics of Scepticism, on the other hand, rests on the idea that government should concern itself with preventing bad things from happening, rather than enabling ambiguously good events. Oakeshott was presumably dissatisfied with this book, which, like much of what he wrote, he never published. It was evidently written well before &quot;On Human Conduct&quot;.

In the latter book Oakeshott employs the analogy of the adverb to describe the kind of restraint that law involves. Laws prescribe &quot;adverbial conditions&quot;: they condition our actions, but they do not determine their substantive chosen ends. For example, the law against murder is not a law against killing as such, but only a law against killing &quot;murderously&quot;. Or, to choose a more trivial example, the law does not dictate that I have a car, but if I do, I must drive it on the same side of the road as everybody else. This contrasts with the rules of enterprise associations, in which the actions required by the management are made compulsory for all.

===Philosophy of history===
In the final work that Oakeshott published in his lifetime, &quot;On History&quot; (1983), he returned to the idea that history is a distinct mode of experience, but this time building on the theory of action developed in &quot;On Human Conduct&quot;. Much of &quot;On History&quot; had emerged from Oakeshott&#x27;s post-retirement graduate seminars at LSE, and had been written at the same time as &quot;On Human Conduct&quot;, in the early 1970s.

During the mid-1960s Oakeshott declared an admiration for Wilhelm Dilthey, one of the pioneers of hermeneutics. &quot;On History&quot; can be interpreted as an essentially neo-Kantian enterprise of working out the conditions of the possibility of historical knowledge, work that Dilthey had begun.

The first three essays set out the distinction between the present of historical experience and the present of practical experience, as well as the concepts of historical situation, historical event, and what is meant by change in history. &quot;On History&quot; includes an essay on jurisprudence (&quot;The Rule of Law&quot;). It also includes a retelling of &quot;The Tower of Babel&quot; in a modern setting in which Oakeshott expresses disdain for human willingness to sacrifice individuality, culture, and quality of life for grand collective projects. He attributes this behaviour to fascination with novelty, persistent dissatisfaction, greed, and lack of self-reflection.

===Other works===
Oakeshott&#x27;s other works included a reader, already mentioned, on &quot;The Social and Political Doctrines of Contemporary Europe&quot;. It consisted of selected texts illustrating the main doctrines of liberalism, national socialism, fascism, communism, and Roman Catholicism (1939). He edited Thomas Hobbes&#x27;s &quot;Leviathan&quot; (1946), with an introduction that has been recognised as a significant contribution to the literature by some later scholars. Several of Oakeshott&#x27;s writings on Hobbes were collected and published in 1975 as &quot;Hobbes on Civil Association&quot;.

With his Cambridge colleague Guy Thompson Griffith, Oakeshott wrote &quot;A Guide to the Classics, or How to Pick The Derby Winner&quot; (1936), a guide to the principles of successful betting on horse-racing. This was his only published non-academic work.

Oakeshott was the author of well over 150 essays and reviews, most of which have now been republished.

Just before he died Oakeshott approved two edited collections of his works, &quot;The Voice of Liberal Learning&quot; (1989), a collection of his essays on education, and a second, revised and expanded edition of &quot;Rationalism in Politics&quot; (1991). Posthumous collections of his writings include &quot;Morality and Politics in Modern Europe&quot; (1993), a lecture series he gave at Harvard in 1958; &quot;Religion, Politics, and the Moral Life&quot; (1993), essays mostly from his early and middle periods; and &quot;The Politics of Faith and the Politics of Scepticism&quot; (1996), an already-mentioned manuscript from the 1950s contemporary with much of &quot;Rationalism in Politics&quot; but written in a more considered tone.

The bulk of his papers are now in the Oakeshott Archive at the London School of Economics. Further volumes of posthumous writings are in preparation, as is a biography, and a series of monographs devoted to his work were published during the first decade of the 21st century, and continue to be produced.

<text>Pure photography or straight photography refers to photography that attempts to depict a scene or subject in sharp focus and detail, in accordance with the qualities that distinguish photography from other visual media, particularly painting. Originating as early as 1904, the term was used by critic Sadakichi Hartmann in the magazine &quot;Camera Work&quot;, and later promoted by its editor, Alfred Stieglitz, as a more pure form of photography than Pictorialism. Once popularized by Stieglitz and other notable photographers, such as Paul Strand, it later became a hallmark of Western photographers, such as Edward Weston, Ansel Adams and others.

Although taken by some to mean lack of manipulation, straight photographers in fact applied many common darkroom techniques to enhance the appearance of their prints. Rather than factual accuracy, the term came to imply a specific aesthetic typified by higher contrast and rich tonality, sharp focus, aversion to cropping, and a Modernism-inspired emphasis on the underlying abstract geometric structure of subjects.

==The West Coast Photographic Movement==
From 1910 to the early 1930s, the dominant style was East Coast Pictorialism in which objects were shot with haze and gauze to purposely blur the image for a soft focus effect. The aim was to mimic Impressionist paintings. With the emerging West Coast Movement, photography no longer imitated painting and developed as a separate art form. The new movement spread in the 1950s as the West Coast artists championed the use of natural environmental forms and clarity of detail—very novel concepts at the time.

Artists of The West Coast Photographic Movement embraced and developed straight photography in the 1930s. In his autobiography, Ansel Adams used the terms straight photography and pure photography. He describes pure photography as, &quot;... defined as possessing no qualities of technique, composition or idea, derivative of any other art form&quot;. Practitioners of this approach created sharp-focus photographs of natural American Western objects and scenery, skilfully composed with subtleties of tone, light and texture, revealing every possible detail in the negatives. This approach was entirely radical and stirred the wrath of many in the local art world. Well known photographers, including Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, his son Brett Weston, Imogen Cunningham, Dody Weston Thompson and Berenice Abbott are considered innovators and practitioners of this style.

This was a close knit community of friends and colleagues. Most were pioneers of realistic photography but there were contemporary artists who also admired and championed this movement. Notable artists and photographers included: Dody Weston Thompson, Ansel Adams, Minor White, Charis Wilson (second wife of Edward Weston and the famous model of his nude photographic work), Paul Strand, Dorothea Lange, Wynn Bullock, Don Ross, William Garnett, Ruth Bernhard, Willard Van Dyke, Nata Piaskowski, Beaumont Newhall and Nancy Newhall, and artists Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Morris Graves and Jean Charlot and his wife Zohmah Charlot. Many other photographic artists of the time considered themselves practitioners of this West Coast counterculture and even formed a group known as Group f/64 to highlight their efforts and set themselves apart from the East Coast pictorialism movement.

This emphasis on the sharp and detailed silver prints dominated modernist photographic aesthetics into the 1970s.

<doc id="389929" wikidata="Q2020205" url="?curid=389929" title="Oliver Evans">
<text>Oliver Evans (September 13, 1755 – April 15, 1819) was an American inventor, engineer, and businessman born in rural Delaware and later rooted commercially in Philadelphia. He was one of the first Americans to build steam engines and an advocate of high-pressure steam (as opposed to low-pressure steam). A pioneer in the fields of automation, materials handling and steam power, Evans was one of the most prolific and influential inventors in the early years of the United States. He left behind a long series of accomplishments, most notably designing and building the first fully automated industrial process, the first high-pressure steam engine, first vapor compression refrigeration and the first (albeit crude) amphibious vehicle and American automobile.

Born in Newport, Delaware, Evans received little formal education and in his mid-teens was apprenticed to a wheelwright. Going into business with his brothers, he worked for over a decade designing, building and perfecting an automated mill with devices such as bucket chains and conveyor belts. In doing so Evans designed a continuous process of manufacturing that required no human labor. This novel concept would prove critical to the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production. Later in life Evans turned his attention to steam power and built the first high-pressure steam engine in the United States in 1801, developing his design independently of Richard Trevithick, who built the first in the world a year earlier. Evans was a driving force in the development and adoption of high-pressure steam engines in the United States. Evans dreamed of building a steam-powered wagon and eventually constructing and running one in 1805. Known as the &quot;Oruktor Amphibolos&quot;, it was the first automobile in the country and the world&#x27;s first amphibious vehicle, although it was too primitive to be a success as either.

Evans was a visionary who produced designs and ideas far ahead of their time. He was the first to describe vapor-compression refrigeration and propose a design for the first refrigerator in 1805, but it would be three decades until his colleague Jacob Perkins would be able to construct a working example. Similarly, he drew up designs for a solar boiler, machine gun, steam-carriage gearshift, dough-kneading machine, perpetual baking oven, marine salvage process, quadruple-effect evaporator, and a scheme for urban gas lighting, ideas and designs which would not be made reality until some time after his death. Evans had influential backers and political allies, but lacked social graces and was disliked by many of his peers. Disappointed and then angry at the perceived lack of recognition for his contributions, Evans became combative and bitter in later years, which damaged his reputation and left him isolated. Despite the importance of his work, his contributions were frequently overlooked (or attributed to others after his death) so he never became a household name alongside the other steam pioneers of his era.

==Early life, 1755–83==
Oliver Evans was born in Newport, Delaware on September 13, 1755, to Charles and Ann Stalcop Evans. His father was a cordwainer by trade, though he purchased a large farm to the north of Newport on the Red Clay Creek and moved his family there when Oliver was still in his infancy. Oliver was the fifth of twelve children; he had four sisters and seven brothers. Little else is known of Evans&#x27;s early life, and surviving records provide few details as to his formative years. The nature and location of his early education have not been preserved, however, his literacy was demonstrably strong from a young age, both as a writer and an avid reader on technical subjects. Aged 17, Evans was apprenticed to a wheelwright and wagon-maker in Newport. An anecdote from the period recalls that his master, an illiterate and extremely frugal man, forbade Evans the use of candles to illuminate his reading in the evenings. Evans found another way by collecting scraps and shavings of wood from his work during the day to serve as fuel for small fires. The Revolutionary War began when Evans was 19. He enlisted in a Delaware militia company but saw no active service during the war.

By the age of 22, Evans moved out of wheel-making and became a specialist in forming the fine wire used in textile cards, which was used to comb fibers in preparation for the spinning process to make thread or yarn. A desire to increase the efficiency of this process led him to his first invention—a machine that would bend wire into teeth and cut them off rapidly to aid the assembly of cards. George Latimer, then a justice of the peace in Newport, saw its potential and tasked a blacksmith with creating the machine, which became one of Evans&#x27;s early successes when it was introduced in 1778. Evans wished to go further in mechanizing the production of textile cards by developing a machine that could puncture the leather into which the wire teeth were inserted. His invention greatly speeded the card manufacturing process, producing around 1,500 teeth every minute, though Evans himself was unable to find financial backing to commercialize his invention. Nevertheless, over the next two decades card manufacturing innovations inspired by Evans led to the development of automated textile card production, then in great demand due to the growth of the Southern cotton industry. Early pioneers of mechanized textile-card production, including Giles Richards and Amos Whittemore, are thought to have borrowed heavily from his original designs.

Evans also began experimenting in this period with steam power and its potential for commercial application. His early ideas culminated in a Delaware state patent application in 1783 for a steam-powered wagon, but it was denied as Evans had yet to produce a working model. That same year, aged 27, Evans married Sarah Tomlinson, daughter of a local farmer, in Old Swedes&#x27; Episcopal Church in Wilmington.

==Developing the automatic flour mill, 1783–90==
Evans&#x27;s attention turned to flour milling in the early 1780s, an industry that was booming in rapidly industrializing northern Delaware. In this era, the operation of grist mills was labor-intensive. Although the stages of the milling process—grinding, cooling, sifting, and packing—were beginning to be mechanized to various degrees, gravity or manual labor was required to move grain from one stage to the next. Additionally, some stages (particularly cooling) were slow and inefficient, creating significant production process bottlenecks. Mills were becoming commonplace in populated areas and those with ready access to waterways for power, but the bulk of milling in the 1780s was done in the home through hand milling. Furthermore, the quality of milled wheat was poor in colonial America. Hard wheat varieties were insufficiently ground and sifted by mills, leaving a flour that was coarse and brown. Cross-contamination was a major problem: mill processes were not well-partitioned; the many people moving about the mill contaminated the flour with dirt, grain and other impurities. The result, Evans recognized, was a low-quality product that took too many laborers to make.

In 1783, two of Evans&#x27;s brothers began building a mill in Newport on part of the family&#x27;s farm estate which they purchased from their father, and Evans was recruited to oversee its construction on the Red Clay Creek. When the mill opened in 1785 it was of a conventional design, but over the next five years, Evans began to experiment with inventions to reduce the reliance upon labor for milling. Moving wheat from the bottom to the top of the mill to begin the process was the most onerous task of all in contemporary mills. Evans&#x27;s first innovation was a bucket elevator to facilitate this process. Chains of buckets to raise water was a Roman technology that had been used in various guises since antiquity. Evans had seen diagrams of their use for marine applications and realized with some modification and careful engineering they could be used to raise grain, so a series of bucket elevators around a mill could move grain and flour from one process to the next. Another labor-intensive task was that of spreading meal. This came out of the grinding process warm and moist, needing cooling and drying before it could be sifted and packed. Traditionally the task was done by manually shoveling meal across large floors. In response, Evans developed the &quot;hopper boy&quot;, a device that gathered meal from a bucket elevator and spread it evenly over the drying floor—a mechanical rake would revolve around the floorspace. This would even out newly deposited meals for cooling and drying, while a gentle incline in the design of the rake blades would slowly move the flour towards central chutes, from which the material would be sifted. Used in conjunction, the two innovations saved many hours of labor and greatly reduced the risk of contamination.
Despite their technical complexity, neither device was revolutionary by the standards of the time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans&#x27;s mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.

Constructing the machinery to realize this vision was complicated. Evans struggled to find the money to pay the highly skilled carpenters needed to construct his complex machines. The nearby flour milling industry on the Brandywine River was large, but dominated by the Quaker millers of Wilmington who saw little potential in Evans&#x27;s designs. James Latimer, a Newport flour merchant upon hearing Evans&#x27;s ideas exclaimed &quot;Ah! Oliver, you cannot make water run uphill, you cannot make wooden millers!&quot; Latimer&#x27;s son, George, however once more saw the promise in Evans&#x27;s ideas and helped him to secure patent protection over the inventions throughout 1787 and 1788. By this time Evans converted his brothers&#x27; mill at Red Clay Creek into a fully automated prototype based on his perfected designs, and the Evans brothers sent handbills and diagrams to the major milling centers of the United States offering free licensing of the designs for the first miller in each county who would commission Evans to refit their mills. Yet this campaign was to prove a major disappointment, and little commercial interest materialized.
Evans lacked patience, however, and coupled with a prickly disposition, was prone to display frustration and bewilderment towards those who could not immediately see the value of his ideas. His ideas and designs were often far ahead of their time, and the idea of a fully automated production process was difficult for contemporaries to comprehend. Evans recalled when some Brandywine millers happened to visit the Red Clay Creek mill in the early years of its operation after it was fully automated. He was alone at the mill that day and making hay in a nearby field, and purposely stayed out of sight so his visitors could observe the mill running independently without human supervision. Evans then appeared and at great length explained how the feat they witnessed was possible, and was convinced that the chance visit would bring about a breakthrough with the Brandywine millers. However, he was frustrated at reports that the millers returned to Wilmington and reported that the Evans mill was &quot;a set of rattletraps, unworthy the notice of any man of sense&quot;. Disinterest continued even after Evans convinced a Brandywine miller to have his mill converted.

After years of persistence and attempts at marketing, Evans&#x27;s designs were finally given a trial on larger scales and adopted elsewhere. A breakthrough came in 1789 when the Ellicotts, a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore, invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River. The refits proved a success, and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott to develop a modified form of Archimedean screw that could act as a horizontal conveyor to work alongside the vertically orientated bucket elevators. He added a rake-drill and conveyor belt to his designs and now possessed a full complement of materials handling machines for just about every possible configuration. In 1790, Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town. Evans&#x27;s inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system, and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $37,000. Local millers quickly followed suit, and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans&#x27;s milling technology. After almost a decade, the Brandywine millers were finally convinced, and within a short period, automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard. In 1790, upon introduction of federal patent law, Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third US patent, with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney-General Edmund Randolph.

==Writer and merchant, 1790–1801==

Having secured patent protection for his designs and general adoption by the Brandywine millers, Evans now turned his attention outside Delaware. His brother Joseph travelled widely to promote Evans&#x27;s work, and according to some sources, by 1792 over one hundred mills were operating Evans machinery. When George Washington called upon Joseph Tatnall in 1790 to thank him for the flour he provided to feed the Continental Army during the War of Independence, he saw Evans&#x27;s technology at work in the mills in Brandywine Village and was so impressed that had his own gristmill at Mount Vernon converted to the Evans system in 1791, the completion of which was overseen by Evans&#x27;s brothers. In 1793, Evans sold his share in the Red Clay Creek mill and moved his family from Wilmington to Philadelphia, where he opened a store for milling supplies.

His early years in Philadelphia though were dominated by writing. Initially, Evans intended to write a pamphlet to assist millers in the construction of milling machinery, as well as promote his own automated designs. However, Evans became so engrossed in the project that he ultimately devoted several years to writing a comprehensive book on milling technology that included long chapters on the basic principles of physics, hydraulics, and mechanics; at times neglecting his family&#x27;s financial security to complete it. &quot;The Young Mill-wright and Miller&#x27;s Guide&quot; when it appeared consisted of five parts: &#x27;Principles of Mechanics and Hydraulics&#x27;, &#x27;Of the different Kinds of Mills&#x27;, &#x27;Description of the Author&#x27;s Improvements&#x27;, &#x27;On the Manufacturing of Grain into Flour&#x27;, &#x27;Ellicott&#x27;s Plans for Building Mills&#x27;, and a lengthy appendix in which Evans detailed various ideas for other inventions, such as a hot-air system of central heating. Thomas Ellicott, whose family were early adopters of Evans&#x27;s designs in Baltimore, contributed a section on mill construction. Much of the theoretical work of the book was based on earlier scientific work on mechanical principles. Yet, Evans insisted that theoretical sections align with observations in the practical sections, and hence often revised standing theories to comport with experiments he conducted and observations he made. For example, he found what was written on the theoretical mechanical principles of waterwheels did not match what he could replicate in practice, so he revised them based on observation to form a &quot;true theory&quot; and concluded that &quot;neither the old or new theories agree with practice, therefore we must suspect that they are founded on error. But if, what I call the true theory, should continue to agree with practice, the practitioner need not care on what it is founded.&quot;

The guide&#x27;s list of subscribers was topped by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Edmund Randolph when the first edition appeared in print in 1795. The book proved very popular and remained a staple manual for millers for over half a century, undergoing several revisions and fifteen printed editions between 1795 and 1860. The book&#x27;s popularity rested on its detailed practical explanations of mill design and construction, and as the principal guidebook for American milling it would not be superseded until after the Civil War.

After the publication of the &quot;Guide&quot;, Evans concentrated on his work as a milling supply merchant and gaining financial security through licensing his patented designs. With enough millers now using Evans&#x27;s machinery, adoption began to accelerate rapidly after 1800, as did his considerable wealth from the license fees. In these years Evans concentrated on growing his commercial operations in Philadelphia, expanding his store several times, becoming an agent for English imports, and taking on blacksmiths to complete more complicated metal work for mills. All the while Evans continued to refine various elements of mill design, including patenting a new process for making millstones and developing a screw mill for grinding plaster of Paris, which was in great demand in Philadelphia for stucco work. Evans and his younger brother Evan, along with blacksmith Thomas Clark, developed a device for packing flour barrels using a wooden disc operating by a compound lever and a .

==Developing the high-pressure steam engine, 1801–06==

Steam engines appeared in the United States as a source of power in the late 18th century, and living in Delaware and Philadelphia meant Evans was exposed to early examples of their application there. John Fitch had launched the first rudimentary steamboat onto the Delaware River in the late 1780s, and the Philadelphia waterworks was by 1802 operating two low-pressure steam engines to pump water from the Schuylkill River, but these were rare examples and most instances of this new technology were to be found in Europe. Much of the development of steam power had occurred in Great Britain, with Thomas Newcomen and James Watt instrumental in developing and commercializing steam power there and elsewhere in Europe, with several hundred of machines operating there in industrial and labor-saving applications by 1800.

Evans had first begun to consider the potential applications of steam power for transportation while still an apprentice in the 1780s, and had developed rudimentary designs for &#x27;steam carriages&#x27; in the 1790s. In 1801, Evans definitively began work on making his long-held dream of a steam carriage a reality, although British engineers such as Richard Trevithick had already begun work on such ideas. Other early steam engineers, most notably Watt contemporary, William Murdoch, had developed plans for a steam-propelled carriage incorporating a heavy flywheel, in which pressure was converted directly to rotary power, however it became apparent in experimentation that a low-pressure, rotary steam engine would never be powerful enough to propel a carriage of any weight forward. Evans&#x27;s attention thus turned to a reciprocating engine, not only for his steam carriage ideas, but also for industrial application. Importantly, Evans became an early proponent, like Trevithick, of &#x27;strong steam&#x27; or high-pressure engines, an idea long resisted by Watt and earlier steam pioneers because the necessary iron making and metal working technology was lacking in America. Evans recognized that a high-pressure steam engine would be essential to the development of a steam carriage because they could be built far smaller while providing similar or greater power outputs to low-pressure equivalents. Some experiments with high-pressure steam engines had been made in Europe, most notably Trevithick&#x27;s &quot;Puffing Devil&quot;, in 1801, and his later &quot;London Steam Carriage&quot; of 1803, which circumvented Watt&#x27;s condenser patent by simply removing it. The prevailing fear of early steam engineering, however, was that no boiler could safely contain high-pressure steam. Watt, for example, wanted to have Trevithick imprisoned because of the danger his high-pressure engines introduced. Evans ignored the potential drawbacks, and developed similarly different designs of engines operating at high-pressure while eliminating Watt&#x27;s condenser. His designs also incorporated a grasshopper beam, a double-acting cylinder, and four steam valves, very similar to Trevithick&#x27;s designs. Each valve was independently operated by one of four cams. The resulting design was a high-pressure steam engine that had a higher power-to-weight ratio than Newcomen engines, setting it among the ranks of other engineers&#x27; engines in their quest to make locomotives and steamboats practical. These engines were also mechanically simpler than condensing engines, making them less costly to build and maintain, and did not require large volumes of condensing water. These features made the engines equally well suited for a variety of industrial applications.
As with the automated mill, Evans&#x27;s ideas were harshly criticized by other engineers—most notably some of the Philadelphia engineering community including the influential Benjamin Latrobe. As it happened, Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick had previously developed nearly identical ideas in favor of high-pressure engines and begun to experiment with them in developing the first locomotives, but it is assumed Evans was unaware of Trevithick&#x27;s work.

Constructing his designs proved far more difficult than Evans initially envisaged—with just six working steam engines in the United States at this time, and a handful of workshops with any experience making them, it took Evans much of his savings and two years to yield a working example to display to the public in 1803. This first engine was powered by a double-acting cylinder six inches in diameter and with a piston stroke length of eighteen inches. Many components, such as the flywheel and crosshead, were made of wood in order to simplify construction. The boiler, the engineering of which was critical to the safe operation of the engine, consisted of a large copper shell encased in wood and cast iron rings in order to contain the pressure. The output of the machine was approximately five horsepower. This work output was modest by contemporary standards—the low-pressure engine of the nearby waterworks produced about twelve horsepower. But his steam engine was just a fraction of the size of pre-existing machines—the waterworks machine was over twenty-five times larger in volume. Evans unveiled his engine at his store and put it to work crushing plaster of Paris and, more sensationally, sawing slabs of marble. The showmanship paid off, and thousands came to see the machine in operation, while the Philadelphia newspaper &quot;Aurora&quot; declared &quot;a new era in the history of the steam engine.&quot;

===Oruktor Amphibolos===

Evans received a patent for his new steam engine in 1804, and set about looking for commercial applications. The first of his proposals was for the Lancaster Turnpike Company. He proposed to construct a steam wagon with the capacity to carry 100 barrels of flour between Philadelphia and Lancaster in two days, which by his estimation would greatly increase profits compared to the equivalent five horse wagons, for whom the trip took three days. Evans declared in his proposal that &quot;I have no doubt but that my engines will propel boats against the current of the Mississippi, and waggons on turnpike roads with great profit.&quot; With the company unsure of the reliability and cost of the technology, the proposal was rejected.

Despite this setback, within a year Evans had found a client. The Philadelphia Board of Health was concerned with the problem of dredging and cleaning the city&#x27;s dockyards and removing sandbars: in 1805 Evans convinced them to contract him to develop a steam-powered dredge. The result was the &quot;Oruktor Amphibolos&quot;, or &quot;Amphibious Digger&quot;. The vessel consisted of a flat-bottomed scow with bucket chains to bring up mud and hooks to clear away sticks, stones and other obstacles. Power for the dredging equipment and propulsion was supplied by a high-pressure Evans engine. The end result was a craft nearly thirty feet long, twelve feet wide and weighing some seventeen tons. To move this ungainly hulk to the waterfront, as well to give a demonstration of his long-held beliefs in the possibility of land-based steam transportation, Evans mounted the hull on four wheels (twice, as the first set collapsed under the weight) and connected the engine to them in order to drive the Oruktor from his workshop through the Philadelphia streets on the way to the Schuylkill River on July 13, 1805. The Oruktor Amphibolos is thus believed to have been the first automobile in the United States, and the first motorized amphibious craft in the world. However, very few contemporary accounts of the craft survive, and Evans&#x27;s tendency to exaggerate its success in his own annals make verification of its performance difficult. Although Evans himself claimed it proceeded successfully around Philadelphia (and circled his erstwhile rival Benjamin Latrobe&#x27;s Philadelphia waterworks) before launching into the river and paddling at speed to Philadelphia harbor; the great weight of the craft make land-propulsion based on its limited engine capacity and jury-rigged power train fairly improbable over any significant distance. It is similarly unknown how well, if at all, the Oruktor functioned as a steamboat, and Evans&#x27;s claims on this point vary significantly over the years. Nevertheless, it is known that the invention proved ineffective for its ostensible purpose as a dredger, and it was scrapped for parts by the Board of Health in 1808. Nevertheless, Evans&#x27;s ideas of steam carriages were not an impossible dream. Evans would continue to promote the idea. In 1812 he published a futuristic description of a world connected by a network of shipping lines railroad tracks and steam locomotives, accurately describing what will happen in the future. long before any such potential could be realized:

&quot;The time will come when people will travel in stages moved by steam engines, from one city to another, almost as fast as birds fly, fifteen or twenty miles in an hour&quot;The Italian automobile model company, Brumm, made a 1/43 scale model of this steam carriage in their &#x27;Old Fire&#x27; series, a series of 8 models of important early steam vehicles. It is no longer in production. It is fairly basic but it seems faithful representation judging by the images of the original to be found online. A rarely modelled example of a vehicle from this period.

===&quot;Steam Engineer&#x27;s Guide&quot;===
Evans frequently quarrelled with fellow inventors and engineering peers over steam technology in the mid-1800s. His increasing frustration led to his premature publication of what he had hoped would be the equivalent of his earlier manual for millers—the petulantly titled &quot;The Abortion of the Young Steam Engineer&#x27;s Guide&quot;. The &quot;Steam Engineer&#x27;s Guide&quot; was significantly shorter than this first book and less structured in its approach. A third of the book is devoted to an ongoing argument between Evans and John Stevens (another prominent steam engineer of the day), much of which had previously appeared in the journal &quot;The Medical Repository&quot; and to which now Evans added various additional criticisms of Stevens&#x27; contentions. Evans concludes his book by renouncing inventing and any further work on his designs, complaining of the ingratitude of the public and the unprofitability of the endeavour, although this would prove to be just one of many such assertions by Evans over the coming years. Regardless, the &quot;Steam Engineer&#x27;s Guide&quot; proved to be a popular work, though not on the same scale as his guide to milling, however it was the first book in the United States to make accessible to anyone ideas and techniques for steam engineering.
The book begins with an introductory discussion of the principles of steam engines and the relevant physical principles, as well as designs for the Evans high-pressure steam engine, boilers, screw-mills and others. Evans developed a similar suite of tools and tables for potential steam engineers as he had for potential millers, such as tables itemizing the heat and pressure tolerances of various metals, instructions for assembling the basic components of a steam-powered system, and schematics for useful components such as valves and boilers. Evans also used the book to justify the safety of high-pressure steam engines if properly constructed, despite the fact that by this time Evans himself had experienced several boiler explosions in his workshop. However, thermodynamics were little understood in his time. As such, many of Evans&#x27;s theoretical contentions, including the &#x27;grand principle&#x27; of steam he develops to guide the mathematical modelling of pressure and fuel in steam engines, were substantially flawed. Although Evans was to be quite successful in the development of high-pressure steam engines (and his designs were widely used), his theoretical understanding of them was limited and he was generally unable to accurately predict the inputs and outputs of his machines. The guide also indulged in a far wider range of topics of interest to Evans, including a compendium of inventions from others which he deemed to be worthy of further circulation—such as a straw-cutter and flour press developed by his brother Evan, and a horse-drawn scraper and earth mover invented by Gershom Johnson. Evans also used the opportunity to encourage government sponsorship of research:

&quot;If government would, at the expense of uncertainty, employ ingenious persons, in every art and science, to make with care every experiment that might lead to the extension of our knowledge of principles, carefully recording the experiments and results so that they might be fully relied on, and leaving readers to draw their own inferences, the money would be well expended; for it would tend greatly to aid the progress of improvement in the arts and sciences.&quot;

This suggestion stemmed from the observation that many engineers relied on the basic principles of physics and mechanics to guide their work, and yet this often required inventors and engineers to become scientists as well to obtain experimental data—something that they were rarely qualified or resourced to do. Short of government funding of such research, Evans also attempted to create in the aftermath of the &quot;Steam Engineer&#x27;s Guide&quot; what he called &#x27;The Experiment Company&#x27;, which would be a private research consortium to conduct reliable experiments and gather data for the benefits of subscribed members. The venture failed and Evans could find no paying stockholders to launch it, possibly due to Evans committing the new venture to developing a steam wagon of his own design. The Franklin Institute would be founded in Philadelphia a few years after Evans&#x27;s death on similar principles.

===Refrigeration===
Despite an incomplete understanding of the principles behind them, in some ways Evans&#x27;s thinking about the potential for steam engines was once again far ahead of its time. In the postscript of the &quot;Steam Engineer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, Evans noted that drawing a vacuum on water reduces its boiling point and cools it. He further observed that a vacuum would have the same effect upon ether, and the resulting cooling should be sufficient to produce ice. He went on to describe a piston vacuum pump apparatus to produce this effect, and also showed that a compression cylinder, or the compression stroke of the vacuum pump, should produce heat in a condenser. Thus Evans had produced the first detailed and theoretically coherent design for a vapor-compression refrigerator, identifying all the major components (expander, cooling coil, compressor and condenser) of a refrigeration cycle, leaving some to credit him as the &#x27;grandfather of refrigeration&#x27;. Although Evans never developed a working model of his designs, and there is no evidence that he ever attempted to, Evans in his later life worked and associated extensively with fellow inventor Jacob Perkins on steam engines and the potential for refrigeration. Perkins would later develop and build a refrigeration device for which he received patents in 1834–1835, employing much the same principles originally put forward by Evans.

==Mars Works, 1806–12==

Having, in his view, perfected many of his ideas and designs for steam engines, Evans turned his attention once more to the commercial propagation of his inventions. His first steam engines had been constructed on an ad-hoc basis, often with improvised tools and workers, and he had relied heavily on blacksmiths and other metal-working shops in Philadelphia with little experience in the more precise metal-work required to build steam engines. In particular, Evans soon realized that unlike his milling machines of wood and leather he would need specialist skills, precision tools and a large foundry in order to build steam machines on a commercial basis. Thus, Evans constructed the Mars Works on a large site a few blocks north of his store in Philadelphia. The choice of name, after the Roman god of war, is thought to have been aspirational and a challenge to the Soho Foundry near Birmingham in the United Kingdom, famous for building the Watt and Boulton engines. Indeed, the completed Mars Works was one of the largest and best equipped outfits of its kind in the United States—by contemporary accounts it featured a substantial foundry, moldmaker&#x27;s shop, blacksmith&#x27;s shops, millstone maker, a steam engine works and a large steam engine of its own to grind materials and work wrought iron. With over thirty-five staff, the Mars Works produced a wide range of manufactures ranging from working steam engines to cast iron fittings, as well as milling and farming machines for Evans&#x27;s now well-established agricultural clientele. Steam engine orders alone proved insufficient to support the extensive business costs; hence the works became highly experienced in producing all kinds of heavy machinery, contributing to Philadelphia&#x27;s emergence as a leading center for such work in the 19th century. Indeed, the works even received military orders, casting naval cannons during the War of 1812. Evans also proved highly innovative in designing steam power solutions for his clients. In one example where the Mars Works was commissioned to build engines for wool processing factories in Middletown, Connecticut, Evans designed a network of accompanying pipes with radiators to heat the factory with engine exhaust.

Although there are no records as to the designs of the early steam engines produced by the Mars Works, Evans&#x27;s most famous engine design appeared around 1812. Called the &quot;Columbian Engine&quot; as a patriotic gesture, it would prove to be the most advanced and successful steam engine design created by Evans—he brought to bear his now extensive experience in designing and building high-pressure steam engines. This horizontally oriented engine allowed the crankshaft and piston rod to work closely together at one end of the machine, thus reducing the need for a heavy working beam like those required for conventional engines. The piston rod itself was kept working to a straight line while by a new type of linkage wherein two sets of pivoted bars guided the movements of the working bar. This linkage is still known as the Evans straight-line linkage, though it was superseded within a few years by more precise straight line mechanisms. The &quot;Columbian&quot; was also the culmination of the grasshopper-style of steam engine. Perfected designs like the &quot;Columbian&quot; saw a popularization of the grasshopper-style and its wide use in a range of applications. In 1813 he made the decision to introduce a condenser to the &quot;Columbian&quot; design. This significantly cut the running cost to the engine, and at this point his engines were as efficient and powerful as low-pressure Watt-Boulton designs, yet far cheaper to build and smaller in size. Within a year 27 &quot;Columbian&quot; engines were operating or under construction in applications ranging from sawmilling and grain milling to the manufacturing of paper, wire and wool.

===Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company===

As the reputation of the Mars Works grew, so too did the demand for its products. After a few years the Mars Works began exporting its engines inland. Oliver Evans&#x27;s son George was the first such order, having moved to Pittsburgh in 1809 to operate the Pittsburgh Steam Flour Mill. George and the mill were highly successful, and generated a great deal of interest in Evans&#x27;s engines across the interior. However exporting engines to western Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical perspective. In 1811 Evans and George, as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens, founded the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company, which in addition to engines would, like the Mars Works, produce heavy machinery and castings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity, the Pittsburgh works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork, as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like hinges and fittings.
The location of the Pittsburgh factory in the Mississippi River watershed was important in the development of high-pressure steam engines for the use in steamboats, and the new company began to promote its engines for river transport. Evans had long been a believer in the application of steam engines for maritime purposes. In his book of 1805, Evans had stated:
&quot;The navigation of the river Mississippi, by steam engines, on the principles here laid down, has for many years been a favorite subject of the author, and among the fondest wishes of his heart&quot;
Evans had long been an acquaintance of John Fitch, the first to build a steamboat in the United States, and the two had worked together on steam projects. The &quot;Oruktor Amphibolos&quot; was Evans&#x27;s lone attempt at building his own steamboat powered by a high-pressure engine and Evans himself was often vague in appraising its capabilities. Yet Robert Fulton had found success with the &quot;North River Steamboat&quot; on the Hudson River in 1807, and thereafter steamboats became a reality. Although he used low-pressure engines, Fulton had in 1812 contacted Evans about the possibility of using Evans&#x27;s engines, though that correspondence did not lead to the implementation of any of Evans&#x27;s designs for Fulton&#x27;s steamships. The Mississippi and tributaries experienced far stronger currents than eastern counterparts, and low-pressure steamboats lacked the power to counteract these. The Enterprise was the first viable steamboat to run on these rivers, and its designer Daniel French employed an adapted Evans&#x27; engine for the purpose. High-pressure engines became the standard on the Mississippi, though relatively few of those were actually built by the Pittsburgh works as Evans&#x27; patent on high-pressure engines was not widely enforced, and many other engine shops opened on the Mississippi that freely adapted Evans&#x27; designs for their own purposes.

Notable examples of river steamboats that were constructed by the Pittsburgh and Mars Works include the &quot;Franklin&quot;, the &quot;Aetna&quot; and the &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. Another, christened the &quot;Oliver Evans&quot; but renamed the &quot;Constitution&quot; by its eventual owners, was lost along with the eleven crew members when its boiler exploded near Point Coupee, Louisiana. Evans was deeply distressed by the news, although he defended the safety of high-pressure engines and cited any explosions as an extremely rare occurrences.

===Patent battles===

Evans found himself in battles to protect his intellectual property many times throughout his career, but he pursued the cause most doggedly during his latter years. His first and most successful patents concerning flour-milling proved the most problematic to defend, and Evans&#x27; battles proved influential in setting precedent for the newly established area of federal patent law. His original patent for his automated flour-mill expired in January 1805, but Evans believed that the fourteen year patent term was too brief and petitioned the Congress to extend it. In January 1808 &quot;An Act for the Relief of Oliver Evans&quot; was passed and signed by President Jefferson, a long-time admirer of Evans&#x27;s work. The act took the extraordinary step of reviving to Evans his expired patent and giving it another fourteen year term— Evans was delighted, but the move was to prove highly problematic, particularly regarding those who had implemented Evans&#x27;s designs in the intervening three year period between the patent terms, as many millers had waited for Evans&#x27;s patent to expire before upgrading their mills.

Evans and his agents set about aggressively collecting royalties from those using his designs. Furthermore, Evans significantly raised the license fees for his use of his patented technology, raising claims of extortion from those being asked to pay, and a great many cases ended up in court. The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans&#x27;s technologies from 1805 to 1808, but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual (as defendants argued) or whether it was only for the three years in question (as Evans argued). Evans by this stage of his life had also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community, and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights stiffened resistance. Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional, but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case.

The most bitter legal battle began in 1809. Evans sued Samuel Robinson—a miller near Baltimore who was using Evans&#x27;s improvements without a license to produce a very modest amount of flour—for damages of $2,500. That sum was deemed unjustifiably high and harsh by many, and Evans&#x27;s actions rallied the Baltimore community against him, and when the case was finally heard in 1812 many appeared in support of the defendant. Evans&#x27;s detractors presented evidence and witnesses at the trial to press the argument that Evans did not truly invent much of what his patents protected. Although the hopper-boy was undoubtedly original, the use of bucket chains and Archimedean screws had been used since ancient times and Evans had only modified some of their features and adapted them for use in a milling context. A now retired Thomas Jefferson weighed into the debate in letters to both Evans and his detractors, questioning the philosophy of patent law and what truly defined &#x27;invention&#x27; and &#x27;machine&#x27; (and to some extent the validity of his claims) but ultimately defended the purpose of patent law, which was to incentivize innovation by rewarding inventors for their development and sharing of new technology. And Jefferson noted that though Evans&#x27;s designs consisted of devices that had long existed beforehand, everyone had access to these and yet only Evans had thought to modify and use them in conjunction to build an automatic mill. Ultimately the jury found in favor of Evans, but it was a pyrrhic victory as Evans had put most of the milling community offside in the process, and ultimately reduced his claim against Robinson to $1,000. In response, prominent Evans critic Isaac McPherson, made submission to Congress in the wake of the trial entitled &quot;Memorial to the Congress of Sundry Citizens of the United States, Praying Relief from the Oppressive Operations of Oliver Evans&#x27; Patent&quot;, seeking to limit the compensation Evans could seek for his patent&#x27;s use or for Congress to void it altogether. Although the Senate drafted a bill that would roll-back some of Evans&#x27;s patent rights, it did not pass, and he continued to vigorously pursue his patent fees. It would not be until the &quot;Patent Act of 1836&quot; that many of these issues, including what constituted originality in the context of a patent, would be addressed.

==Later life and death, 1812–19==

Although Evans had always suffered from bouts of depression, and bitterness towards those he felt did not appreciate his inventions, such sentiments seemed to peak in his later years. During one of his many legal battles in 1809, comments from the presiding judge sent Evans into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many schematics and papers regarding his inventions, both prior and future. Evans declared at the time that inventing had led only to heartache, disappointment and under-appreciation; and committed himself to business and material acquisition for the sake of his family. Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from Evans, and he did continue his interest in inventing, but the tone of Evans&#x27;s later life was undoubtedly one of hostility and disappointment.

Evans gradually withdrew from the operations of his workshops, with his son George managing operations in Pittsburgh and his sons-in-law James Rush and John Muhlenberg likewise in Philadelphia. The Mars Works was by now an established entity, receiving prestigious commissions such as the engines for the Philadelphia Mint in 1816. Records indicate the Mars Works would turn out more than one hundred steam engines by the time of Evans death. In retirement Evans became increasingly consumed with pursuing his patent dues from those using his technology, which was now widespread. In 1817 he stated that his time was &quot;wholly engrossed by law suits&quot;. Evans had become somewhat obsessed and took on a siege mentality, penning to his numerous lawyers (at its height he had fifteen working on his various cases across the United States) his final work, known as &quot;Oliver Evans to His Counsel: Who are Engaged in Defence of His Patent Rights, for the Improvements He Has Invented: Containing a Short Account of Two Out of Eighty of His Inventions, Their Rise and Progress in Despite of All Opposition and Difficulties, and Two of His Patents with Explanations&quot;. Evans undertook travel to distant areas of the country in order to find offenders. On a trip to Vermont, Evans visited various mills and then promptly engaged a lawyer there to press charges against twenty-two of them for perceived breaches of his patent rights.

In his last years Evans compiled a list, since lost, of all his inventions—eighty in total, as alluded to in the title of his last publication to his lawyers. Some of his unfinished ideas that are known include a scheme for the gas lighting of cities in the United States, a means for raising sunken ships, a machine gun, a self-oiling shaft bearing, various types of gearshift for steam carriages, a dough-kneading machine and a perpetual baking oven. In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn&#x27;t get far.

In 1816 his wife Sarah died, although the cause is unrecorded. Evans remarried two years later in April 1818 to Hetty Ward, who was many years his junior and the daughter of the New York innkeeper. In these last years Evans lived in New York with his new wife. In early 1819 Evans developed an inflammation of the lungs and, after a month of illness, died on April 15, 1819. Just four days prior, on April 11, news had reached him in New York that the Mars Works in Philadelphia had burned down, though his sons-in-law were committed to re-establishing the business and did so further outside of the city. Evans was buried at Zion Episcopal Church in Manhattan, but when that church was sold his body was moved several times until finally resting in 1890 in an unmarked common grave at Trinity Cemetery, Broadway at 157th Street, New York City.

==Legacy==

Undoubtedly, Evans&#x27; contributions to milling were profound and the most rapidly adopted. Within his lifetime American milling had undergone a revolution, and his designs allowed mills to be built on industrial-scales with far greater efficiency. Now a more profitable enterprise, the number of mills increased dramatically across the United States. The price of flour fell significantly, availability increased, and the automated drying and bolting processes increased the quality and fineness of flour. In turn this led to major shift in bread making—cheaper and better quality flour lowered the cost of bread production and within a generation the majority of bread consumption shifted from the home-made to store-bought. The revolution was even more far-reaching in Europe where the so-called &quot;American System&quot; was quickly adopted by the milling industry and triggered major increases in food production—sorely needed in a period of almost continual warfare at the turn of the 18th century.

Although several key elements of Evans&#x27;s designs—such as bucket elevators and Archimedean screws—were merely modified rather than invented by him, the combination of many machines into an automated and continuous production line was a unique idea that would prove pivotal to both the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production. Scientific and technical historians now generally credit Evans as the first in a line of industrialists that culminated with Henry Ford and the modern assembly line. His concept of industrial automation was far ahead of its time, and the paradigm shift within manufacturing towards that concept would take more than a century to be fully realized. However continuous process manufacturing would spread from Evans&#x27;s milling designs, first to related industries such as brewing and baking, then eventually to a wide variety of products, as technology and prevailing opinion caught up. Evans contributions were later deemed to be so important that eminent industrial historian Sigfried Giedion would conclude that in this respect, Evans &quot;opens a new chapter in the history of mankind&quot;.
Evans&#x27; contributions to steam were not as ground-breaking as his earlier work in milling but he played a critical role by inventing and propagating the high-pressure steam engine in the United States. Evans&#x27; engines, particularly the &quot;Columbian,&quot; were highly influential in early steam-power applications in United States (particularly in the evolution of steamboats and steam-powered industrial processes). Yet once more Evans was ahead of the curve with many of his ideas, and his death during steam&#x27;s infancy in the United States meant that it would be some time before many of his ideas would come to fruition. For example, although a leading advocate for high-pressure engines, it would not be until the 1830s that such engines definitively replaced low-pressure designs. And Evans&#x27; dream of a steam wagon, notwithstanding the brave attempt of the &quot;Oruktor Amphibolos&quot;, would not see widespread adoption until even later. And unlike his earlier contributions, Evans was just one of many brilliant minds in steam technology. It would be another inventor, Richard Trevithick, working totally independently of Evans who would develop the high-pressure engine that would make that dream possible.

And yet despite his formidable record and undoubted importance in the history of technology, Evans never became a household name. In this respect Evans was his own worst enemy. He was deeply affected by a perceived lack of recognition and appreciation from his peers for his work, and his bouts of depression would lead him to act in the extreme, prematurely ending projects and vowing to give up inventing many times over the course of his life. In time these feelings turned to bitterness and vengeance towards those who criticized or doubted him, and led him to become notoriously bombastic and combative, often aggrandizing his accomplishments and fiercely denouncing critics (such as the wild exaggerations as to the success of the &quot;Oruktor Amphibolos&quot; at the end of his life). While his relentless pursuit of patent rights did indeed force people to pay him his due, the process badly damaged his reputation and made him many enemies. A leading Philadelphia merchant summed it up in 1802, stating &quot;few if any [millers] are inclined to give pompous blockhead, Oliver Evans, the credit of inventing any of the useful contrivances in milling for which he now enjoys patents.&quot;

And yet in spite of his anguish and the weight of his detractors, Evans was steadfastly persistent in the pursuit of his ideas, a quality which Evans felt would ultimately see him triumph. The French translator of the &quot;Young Steam Engineer&#x27;s Guide&quot; agreed, concluding &quot;posterity will place his name among those who are most truly distinguished for their eminent services rendered to their country and to humanity.&quot;

<text>David First (born August 20, 1953) is an American composer and guitarist. His music most often deals with drones and interference beats, the latter aligning his music with that of Alvin Lucier. He has led the World Casio Quartet, Joy Buzzers and The Notekillers which originally existed from 1977–81 and reformed in 2004. He is also a member of Matter Waves, which includes Kid Millions on drums and Bernard Gann on bass, and the music collective New Party Systems.

His albums include 1991&#x27;s &quot;Resolver&quot;, instrumental pieces influenced by minimalism and 2002&#x27;s relatively pop-oriented &quot;Universary&quot;, which consists of &quot;songs and drones&quot;. More recent releases include 2010&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re Here to Help&quot; (Prophase Records) by The Notekillers and &quot;Privacy Issues&quot;, a 3-CD set of droneworks on the XI label.

In 1995 First, along with visual artist Patricia Smith created an opera, &quot;The Manhattan Book of the Dead&quot;, which was presented at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club&#x27;s Annex Theater in 1995 and The Washaus in Potsdam, Germany in 1996.

First received a 2001 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award.

In January 2012, the music collective, New Party Systems, an ensemble containing First, released a song First wrote (C2011 Silent Graph Music ASCAP), &quot;We Are&quot; –– an anthem for the 99%, with a video by director, Toni Comas.

<text>The Monongahela Connecting Railroad or Mon Conn was a three-mile industrial railroad line in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was a subsidiary of the Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Company and a large portion of its work was for its parent company, though it also served other industries along the line.

==History==
The railroad is possibly best known for its Hot Metal Bridge, which was used to carry molten iron across the Monongahela River from J&amp;L&#x27;s Eliza Furnaces to the Bessemer converters (later, open hearth furnaces) and rolling mills at J&amp;L&#x27;s South Side facility.

In 1966, the company was involved in construction of the Pittsburgh Tri-Port Terminal, which had been created &quot;to offer prompt movement of products for rail, truck and river delivery,&quot; and was slated to be &quot;used to load or unload river barges for transfer to trucks or railroad,&quot; and was &quot;intended to reduce truck traffic over city streets.&quot;

The railroad was also a dieselization pioneer, buying many early diesel locomotives from Alco, General Electric and other manufacturers.

The Monongahela Connecting Railroad was acquired by real estate firm Almono in 2002, who ceased providing common carrier services the following year.

The Monongahela River bridge has been converted to a two-lane automobile bridge, with the adjacent hot metal bridge converted for bicycles. The bridges are collectively called the Hot Metal Bridge. The railroad served a few small industrial customers along the north/east (right downstream) bank of the river.

Joseph L. Sorensen was Vice President of the Monongahela Connecting Railroad from 1948 until 1952.

<text>A diesel locomotive is a type of railway locomotive in which the power source is a diesel engine. Several types of diesel locomotives have been developed, differing mainly in the means by which mechanical power is conveyed to the driving wheels. The most common are diesel–electric locomotives and diesel–hydraulic.

Early internal combustion locomotives and railcars used kerosene and gasoline as their fuel. Rudolf Diesel patented his first compression-ignition engine in 1898, and steady improvements to the design of diesel engines reduced their physical size and improved their power-to-weight ratios to a point where one could be mounted in a locomotive. Internal combustion engines only operate efficiently within a limited power band, and while low-power gasoline engines could be coupled to mechanical transmissions, the more powerful diesel engines required the development of new forms of transmission. This is because clutches would need to be very large at these power levels and would not fit in a standard -wide locomotive frame, or would wear too quickly to be useful.

The first successful diesel engines used diesel–electric transmissions, and by 1925 a small number of diesel locomotives of were in service in the United States. In 1930, Armstrong Whitworth of the United Kingdom delivered two locomotives using Sulzer-designed engines to Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway of Argentina. In 1933, diesel–electric technology developed by Maybach was used to propel the DRG Class SVT 877, a high-speed intercity two-car set, and went into series production with other streamlined car sets in Germany starting in 1935. In the United States, diesel–electric propulsion was brought to high-speed mainline passenger service in late 1934, largely through the research and development efforts of General Motors dating back to the late 1920s and advances in lightweight car body design by the Budd Company.

The economic recovery from World War II hastened the widespread adoption of diesel locomotives in many countries. They offered greater flexibility and performance than steam locomotives, as well as substantially lower operating and maintenance costs.

==History==
===Adaptation for rail use===

The earliest recorded example of the use of an internal combustion engine in a railway locomotive is the prototype designed by William Dent Priestman, which was examined by William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin in 1888 who described it as a &quot;Priestman oil engine mounted upon a truck which is worked on a temporary line of rails to show the adaptation of a petroleum engine for locomotive purposes.&quot; In 1894, a two-axle machine built by Priestman Brothers was used on the Hull Docks. In 1896, an oil-engined railway locomotive was built for the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, England, using an engine designed by Herbert Akroyd Stuart. It was not a diesel, because it used a hot-bulb engine (also known as a semi-diesel), but it was the precursor of the diesel.

Rudolf Diesel considered using his engine for powering locomotives in his 1893 book &quot;Theorie und Konstruktion eines rationellen Wärmemotors zum Ersatz der Dampfmaschine und der heute bekannten Verbrennungsmotoren&quot; (&quot;Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Motor&quot;). However, the large size and poor power-to-weight ratio of early diesel engines made them unsuitable for propelling land-based vehicles. Therefore, the engine&#x27;s potential as a railroad prime mover was not initially recognized. This changed as research and development reduced the size and weight of the engine.

In 1906, Rudolf Diesel, Adolf Klose and the steam and diesel engine manufacturer Gebrüder Sulzer founded Diesel-Sulzer-Klose GmbH to manufacture diesel-powered locomotives. Sulzer had been manufacturing diesel engines since 1898. The Prussian State Railways ordered a diesel locomotive from the company in 1909, and after test runs between Winterthur and Romanshorn, Switzerland, the diesel–mechanical locomotive was delivered in Berlin in September 1912. The world&#x27;s first diesel-powered locomotive was operated in the summer of 1912 on the same line from Winterthur but was not a commercial success. During test runs in 1913 several problems were found. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 prevented all further trials. The locomotive weight was 95 tonnes and the power was with a maximum speed of .

Small numbers of prototype diesel locomotives were produced in a number of countries through the mid-1920s.

===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Asia===
==== China ====
One of the first domestically developed Diesel vehicles of China was the Dongfeng DMU (东风), produced in 1958 by CSR Sifang. Series production of China&#x27;s first Diesel locomotive class, the DFH1, began in 1964 following the construction of a prototype in 1959.

==== India ====
====Japan====
In Japan, starting in the 1920s, some petrol–electric railcars were produced. The first diesel–electric traction and the first air-streamed vehicles on Japanese rails were the two DMU3s of class Kiha 43000 (キハ43000系). Japan&#x27;s first series of diesel locomotives was class DD50 (国鉄DD50形), twin locomotives, developed since 1950 and in service since 1953.

===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Europe===
====First functional diesel vehicles====
In 1914, the world&#x27;s first functional diesel–electric railcars were produced for the &quot;Königlich-Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen&quot; (Royal Saxon State Railways) by Waggonfabrik Rastatt with electric equipment from Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie and diesel engines from Swiss Sulzer AG. They were classified as DET 1 and DET 2 (). Because of a shortage of petrol products during World War I, they remained unused for regular service in Germany. In 1922, they were sold to Swiss Compagnie du Chemin de fer Régional du Val-de-Travers, where they were used in regular service up to the electrification of the line in 1944. Afterwards, the company kept them in service as boosters until 1965.

Fiat claims to have built the first Italian diesel–electric locomotive in 1922, but little detail is available. Several Fiat-TIBB Bo&#x27;Bo&#x27; diesel–locomotives were built for service on the narrow gauge Ferrovie Calabro Lucane and the Società per le Strade Ferrate del Mediterrano in southern Italy in 1926, following trials in 1924–25. The six-cylinder two-stroke motor produced at 500rpm, driving four DC motors, one for each axle. These locomotives with top speed proved quite successful.

In 1924, two diesel–electric locomotives were taken in service by the Soviet railways, almost at the same time:

* The engine Ээл2 (Eel2 original number Юэ 001/Yu-e 001) started on October 22. It had been designed by a team led by Yuri Lomonosov and built 1923–1924 by Maschinenfabrik Esslingen in Germany. It had five driving axles (1&#x27;E1&#x27;). After several test rides, it hauled trains for almost three decades from 1925 to 1954. It became a model for several classes of Soviet diesel locomotives.
* The engine Щэл1 (Shch-el 1, original number &quot;Юэ2/Yu-e 2)&quot;, started on November 9. It had been developed by Yakov Modestovich Gakkel and built by Baltic Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. It had ten driving axles in three bogies (1&#x27; Co&#x27; Do&#x27; Co&#x27; 1&#x27;). From 1925 to 1927, it hauled trains between Moscow and Kursk and in Caucasus region. Due to technical problems, afterwards, it was out of service. Since 1934, it was used as a stationary electric generator.

In 1935, Krauss-Maffei, MAN and Voith built the first diesel–hydraulic locomotive, called V 140, in Germany. Diesel–hydraulics became the mainstream in diesel locomotives in Germany since the German railways (DRG) were pleased with the performance of that engine. Serial production of diesel locomotives in Germany began after World War II.

====Switchers====

In many railway stations and industrial compounds, steam shunters had to be kept hot during many breaks between scattered short tasks. Therefore, diesel traction became economical for shunting before it became economical for hauling trains. The construction of diesel shunters began in 1920 in France, in 1925 in Denmark, in 1926 in the Netherlands, and in 1927 in Germany. After a few years of testing, hundreds of units were produced within a decade.

====Diesel railcars for regional traffic====
Diesel-powered or &quot;oil-engined&quot; railcars, generally diesel–mechanical, were developed by various European manufacturers in the 1930s, e.g. by William Beardmore and Company for the Canadian National Railways (the Beardmore Tornado engine was subsequently used in the R101 airship). Some of those series for regional traffic were begun with gasoline motors and then continued with diesel motors, such as Hungarian BCmot (The class code doesn&#x27;t tell anything but &quot;railmotor with 2nd and 3rd class seats&quot;.), 128 cars built 1926–1937, or German Wismar railbuses (57 cars 1932–1941). In France, the first diesel railcar was Renault VH, 115 units produced 1933/34.
In Italy, after six Gasoline cars since 1931, Fiat and Breda built a lot of diesel railmotors, more than 110 from 1933 to 1938 and 390 from 1940 to 1953, Class 772 known as &quot;Littorina&quot;, and Class ALn 900.

====High-speed railcars====
In the 1930s, streamlined highspeed diesel railcars were developed in several countries:

* In Germany, the Flying Hamburger was built in 1932. After a test ride in December 1932, this two-coach diesel railcar (in English terminology a DMU2) started service at Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG) in February 1933. It became the prototype of DRG Class SVT 137 with 33 more highspeed DMUs, built for DRG till 1938, 13 DMU 2 (&quot;Hamburg&quot; series), 18 DMU 3 (&quot;Leipzig&quot; and &quot;Köln&quot; series), and two DMU 4 (&quot;Berlin&quot; series).
* French SNCF classes XF 1000 and XF 1100 comprised 11 high-speed DMUs, also called TAR, built 1934–1939.
* In Hungary, Ganz Works built the , a kind of a luxurious railbus in a series of seven items since 1934 and started to build the in 1944.

====Further developments====
In 1945, a batch of 30 Baldwin diesel–electric locomotives, Baldwin 0-6-6-0 1000, was delivered from the United States to the railways of the Soviet Union.

In 1947, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) introduced the first of a pair of Co-Co diesel–electric locomotives (later British Rail Class D16/1) for regular use in the United Kingdom, although British manufacturers such as Armstrong Whitworth had been exporting diesel locomotives since 1930. Fleet deliveries to British Railways, of other designs such as Class 20 and Class 31, began in 1957.

Series production of diesel locomotives in Italy began in the mid-1950s. Generally, diesel traction in Italy was of less importance than in other countries, as it was amongst the most advanced countries in the electrification of the main lines and as Italian geography makes freight transport by sea cheaper than rail transportation even on many domestic connections.

=== Early diesel locomotives and railcars in North America ===
====Early North American developments====
Adolphus Busch purchased the American manufacturing rights for the diesel engine in 1898 but never applied this new form of power to transportation. He founded the Busch-Sulzer company in 1911.
Only limited success was achieved in the early twentieth century with internal combustion engined railcars, due, in part, to difficulties with mechanical drive systems.

General Electric (GE) entered the railcar market in the early twentieth century, as Thomas Edison possessed a patent on the electric locomotive, his design actually being a type of electrically propelled railcar. GE built its first electric locomotive prototype in 1895. However, high electrification costs caused GE to turn its attention to internal combustion power to provide electricity for electric railcars. Problems related to co-ordinating the prime mover and electric motor were immediately encountered, primarily due to limitations of the Ward Leonard current control system that had been chosen. GE Rail was formed in 1907 and 112 years later, in 2019, was purchased by and merged with Wabtec.

A significant breakthrough occurred in 1914, when Hermann Lemp, a GE electrical engineer, developed and patented a reliable control system that controlled the engine and traction motor with a single lever; subsequent improvements were also patented by Lemp. Lemp&#x27;s design solved the problem of overloading and damaging the traction motors with excessive electrical power at low speeds, and was the prototype for all internal combustion–electric drive control systems.

In 1917–1918, GE produced three experimental diesel–electric locomotives using Lemp&#x27;s control design, the first known to be built in the United States. Following this development, the 1923 Kaufman Act banned steam locomotives from New York City, because of severe pollution problems. The response to this law was to electrify high-traffic rail lines. However, electrification was uneconomical to apply to lower-traffic areas.

The first regular use of diesel–electric locomotives was in switching (shunter) applications, which were more forgiving than mainline applications of the limitations of contemporary diesel technology and where the idling economy of diesel relative to steam would be most beneficial. GE entered a collaboration with the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and Ingersoll-Rand (the &quot;AGEIR&quot; consortium) in 1924 to produce a prototype &quot;boxcab&quot; locomotive delivered in July 1925. This locomotive demonstrated that the diesel–electric power unit could provide many of the benefits of an electric locomotive without the railroad having to bear the sizeable expense of electrification. The unit successfully demonstrated, in switching and local freight and passenger service, on ten railroads and three industrial lines. Westinghouse Electric and Baldwin collaborated to build switching locomotives starting in 1929. However, the Great Depression curtailed demand for Westinghouse&#x27;s electrical equipment, and they stopped building locomotives internally, opting to supply electrical parts instead.

In June 1925, Baldwin Locomotive Works outshopped a prototype diesel–electric locomotive for &quot;special uses&quot; (such as for runs where water for steam locomotives was scarce) using electrical equipment from Westinghouse Electric Company. Its twin-engine design was not successful, and the unit was scrapped after a short testing and demonstration period. Industry sources were beginning to suggest &quot;the outstanding advantages of this new form of motive power&quot;. In 1929, the Canadian National Railways became the first North American railway to use diesels in mainline service with two units, 9000 and 9001, from Westinghouse. However, these early diesels proved expensive and unreliable, with their high cost of acquisition relative to steam unable to be realized in operating cost savings as they were frequently out of service. It would be another five years before diesel–electric propulsion would be successfully used in mainline service, and nearly ten years before fully replacing steam became a real prospect with existing diesel technology.

Before diesel power could make inroads into mainline service, the limitations of diesel engines circa 1930 – low power-to-weight ratios and narrow output range – had to be overcome. A major effort to overcome those limitations was launched by General Motors after they moved into the diesel field with their acquisition of the Winton Engine Company, a major manufacturer of diesel engines for marine and stationary applications, in 1930. Supported by the General Motors Research Division, GM&#x27;s Winton Engine Corporation sought to develop diesel engines suitable for high-speed mobile use. The first milestone in that effort was delivery in early 1934 of the Winton 201A, a two-stroke, mechanically aspirated, uniflow-scavenged, unit-injected diesel engine that could deliver the required performance for a fast, lightweight passenger train. The second milestone, and the one that got American railroads moving towards diesel, was the 1938 delivery of GM&#x27;s Model 567 engine that was designed specifically for locomotive use, bringing a fivefold increase in life of some mechanical parts and showing its potential for meeting the rigors of freight service.

Diesel–electric railroad locomotion entered mainline service when the Burlington Route and Union Pacific used custom-built diesel &quot;streamliners&quot; to haul passengers, starting in late 1934. Burlington&#x27;s &quot;Zephyr&quot; trainsets evolved from articulated three-car sets with 600 hp power cars in 1934 and early 1935, to the &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot; semi-articulated ten car trainsets pulled by cab-booster power sets introduced in late 1936. Union Pacific started diesel streamliner service between Chicago and Portland Oregon in June 1935, and in the following year would add Los Angeles, CA, Oakland, CA, and Denver, CO to the destinations of diesel streamliners out of Chicago. The Burlington and Union Pacific streamliners were built by the Budd Company and the Pullman-Standard Company, respectively, using the new Winton engines and power train systems designed by GM&#x27;s Electro-Motive Corporation. EMC&#x27;s experimental 1800 hp B-B locomotives of 1935 demonstrated the multiple-unit control systems used for the cab/booster sets and the twin-engine format used with the later &quot;Zephyr&quot; power units. Both of those features would be used in EMC&#x27;s later production model locomotives. The lightweight diesel streamliners of the mid-1930s demonstrated the advantages of diesel for passenger service with breakthrough schedule times, but diesel locomotive power would not fully come of age until regular series production of mainline diesel locomotives commenced and it was shown suitable for full-size passenger and freight service.

====First American series production locomotives====

Following their 1925 prototype, the AGEIR consortium produced 25 more units of &quot;60 ton&quot; AGEIR boxcab switching locomotives between 1925 and 1928 for several New York City railroads, making them the first series-produced diesel locomotives. The consortium also produced seven twin-engine &quot;100 ton&quot; boxcabs and one hybrid trolley/battery unit with a diesel-driven charging circuit. ALCO acquired the McIntosh &amp; Seymour Engine Company in 1929 and entered series production of and single-cab switcher units in 1931. ALCO would be the pre-eminent builder of switch engines through the mid-1930s and would adapt the basic switcher design to produce versatile and highly successful, albeit relatively low powered, road locomotives.

GM, seeing the success of the custom streamliners, sought to expand the market for diesel power by producing standardized locomotives under their Electro-Motive Corporation. In 1936, EMC&#x27;s new factory started production of switch engines. In 1937, the factory started producing their new E series streamlined passenger locomotives, which would be upgraded with more reliable purpose-built engines in 1938. Seeing the performance and reliability of the new 567 model engine in passenger locomotives, EMC was eager to demonstrate diesel&#x27;s viability in freight service.

Following the successful 1939 tour of EMC&#x27;s FT demonstrator freight locomotive set, the stage was set for dieselization of American railroads. In 1941, ALCO-GE introduced the RS-1 road-switcher that occupied its own market niche while EMD&#x27;s F series locomotives were sought for mainline freight service. The US entry into World War II slowed conversion to diesel; the War Production Board put a halt to building new passenger equipment and gave naval uses priority for diesel engine production. During the petroleum crisis of 1942–43, coal-fired steam had the advantage of not using fuel that was in critically short supply. EMD was later allowed to increase the production of its FT locomotives and ALCO-GE was allowed to produce a limited number of DL-109 road locomotives, but most in the locomotive business were restricted to making switch engines and steam locomotives.

In the early postwar era, EMD dominated the market for mainline locomotives with their E and F series locomotives. ALCO-GE in the late 1940s produced switchers and road-switchers that were successful in the short-haul market. However, EMD launched their GP series road-switcher locomotives in 1949, which displaced all other locomotives in the freight market including their own F series locomotives. GE subsequently dissolved its partnership with ALCO and would emerge as EMD&#x27;s main competitor in the early 1960s, eventually taking the top position in the locomotive market from EMD.

Early diesel–electric locomotives in the United States used direct current (DC) traction motors but alternating current (AC) motors came into widespread use in the 1990s, starting with the Electro-Motive SD70MAC in 1993 and followed by General Electric&#x27;s AC4400CW in 1994 and AC6000CW in 1995.

===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Oceania===
The Trans-Australian Railway built 1912 to 1917 by Commonwealth Railways (CR) passes through 2,000 km of waterless (or salt watered) desert terrain unsuitable for steam locomotives. The original engineer Henry Deane envisaged diesel operation to overcome such problems. Some have suggested that the CR worked with the South Australian Railways to trial diesel traction. However, the technology was not developed enough to be reliable.

As in Europe, the usage of internal combustion engines advanced more readily in self-propelled railcars than in locomotives:

* Some Australian railway companies bought McKeen railmotors.
* In the 1920s and 1930s, more reliable Gasoline railmotors were built by Australian industries.
* Australia&#x27;s first diesel railcars were the NSWGR 100 Class (PH later DP) Silver City Comet cars in 1937.
* High-speed vehicles for those days&#x27; possibilities on were the ten Vulcan railcars of 1940 for New Zealand.

==Transmission types==

===Diesel–mechanical===
A diesel–mechanical locomotive uses a mechanical transmission in a fashion similar to that employed in most road vehicles. This type of transmission is generally limited to low-powered, low-speed shunting (switching) locomotives, lightweight multiple units and self-propelled railcars.
The mechanical transmissions used for railroad propulsion are generally more complex and much more robust than standard-road versions. There is usually a fluid coupling interposed between the engine and gearbox, and the gearbox is often of the epicyclic (planetary) type to permit shifting while under load. Various systems have been devised to minimise the break in transmission during gear changing, such as the S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) gearbox used by Hudswell Clarke.

Diesel–mechanical propulsion is limited by the difficulty of building a reasonably sized transmission capable of coping with the power and torque required to move a heavy train. A number of attempts to use diesel–mechanical propulsion in high power applications have been made (for example, the British Rail 10100 locomotive), though only few have proven successful (such as the DSB Class MF).
===Diesel–electric===

 

In a diesel–electric locomotive, the diesel engine drives either an electrical DC generator (generally, less than net for traction), or an electrical AC alternator-rectifier (generally 3,000hp net or more for traction), the output of which provides power to the traction motors that drive the locomotive. There is no mechanical connection between the diesel engine and the wheels.

The important components of diesel–electric propulsion are the diesel engine (also known as the prime mover), the main generator/alternator-rectifier, traction motors (usually with four or six axles), and a control system consisting of the engine governor and electrical or electronic components, including switchgear, rectifiers and other components, which control or modify the electrical supply to the traction motors. In the most elementary case, the generator may be directly connected to the motors with only very simple switchgear.

Originally, the traction motors and generator were DC machines. Following the development of high-capacity silicon rectifiers in the 1960s, the DC generator was replaced by an alternator using a diode bridge to convert its output to DC. This advance greatly improved locomotive reliability and decreased generator maintenance costs by elimination of the commutator and brushes in the generator. Elimination of the brushes and commutator, in turn, eliminated the possibility of a particularly destructive type of event referred to as a flashover (also known as an arc fault), which could result in immediate generator failure and, in some cases, start an engine room fire.

Current North American practice is for four axles for high-speed passenger or &quot;time&quot; freight, or for six axles for lower-speed or &quot;manifest&quot; freight. The most modern units on &quot;time&quot; freight service tend to have six axles underneath the frame. Unlike those in &quot;manifest&quot; service, &quot;time&quot; freight units will have only four of the axles connected to traction motors, with the other two as idler axles for weight distribution.

In the late 1980s, the development of high-power variable-voltage/variable-frequency (VVVF) drives, or &quot;traction inverters&quot;, allowed the use of polyphase AC traction motors, thereby also eliminating the motor commutator and brushes. The result is a more efficient and reliable drive that requires relatively little maintenance and is better able to cope with overload conditions that often destroyed the older types of motors.

====Diesel–electric control====

A diesel–electric locomotive&#x27;s power output is independent of road speed, as long as the unit&#x27;s generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit&#x27;s ability to develop tractive effort (also referred to as drawbar pull or tractive force, which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel–electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.

====Throttle operation====
The prime mover&#x27;s power output is primarily determined by its rotational speed (RPM) and fuel rate, which are regulated by a governor or similar mechanism. The governor is designed to react to both the throttle setting, as determined by the engine driver and the speed at which the prime mover is running (see Control theory).

Locomotive power output, and therefore speed, is typically controlled by the engine driver using a stepped or &quot;notched&quot; throttle that produces binary-like electrical signals corresponding to throttle position. This basic design lends itself well to multiple unit (MU) operation by producing discrete conditions that assure that all units in a consist respond in the same way to throttle position. Binary encoding also helps to minimize the number of trainlines (electrical connections) that are required to pass signals from unit to unit. For example, only four trainlines are required to encode all possible throttle positions if there are up to 14 stages of throttling.

North American locomotives, such as those built by EMD or General Electric, have eight throttle positions or &quot;notches&quot; as well as a &quot;reverser&quot; to allow them to operate bi-directionally. Many UK-built locomotives have a ten-position throttle. The power positions are often referred to by locomotive crews depending upon the throttle setting, such as &quot;run 3&quot; or &quot;notch 3&quot;.

In older locomotives, the throttle mechanism was ratcheted so that it was not possible to advance more than one power position at a time. The engine driver could not, for example, pull the throttle from notch 2 to notch 4 without stopping at notch 3. This feature was intended to prevent rough train handling due to abrupt power increases caused by rapid throttle motion (&quot;throttle stripping&quot;, an operating rules violation on many railroads). Modern locomotives no longer have this restriction, as their control systems are able to smoothly modulate power and avoid sudden changes in train loading regardless of how the engine driver operates the controls.
When the throttle is in the idle position, the prime mover receives minimal fuel, causing it to idle at low RPM. In addition, the traction motors are not connected to the main generator and the generator&#x27;s field windings are not excited (energized) – the generator does not produce electricity without excitation. Therefore, the locomotive will be in &quot;neutral&quot;. Conceptually, this is the same as placing an automobile&#x27;s transmission into neutral while the engine is running.

To set the locomotive in motion, the reverser control handle is placed into the correct position (forward or reverse), the brake is released and the throttle is moved to the run 1 position (the first power notch). An experienced engine driver can accomplish these steps in a coordinated fashion that will result in a nearly imperceptible start. The positioning of the reverser and movement of the throttle together is conceptually like shifting an automobile&#x27;s automatic transmission into gear while the engine is idling.

Placing the throttle into the first power position will cause the traction motors to be connected to the main generator and the latter&#x27;s field coils to be excited. With excitation applied, the main generator will deliver electricity to the traction motors, resulting in motion. If the locomotive is running &quot;light&quot; (that is, not coupled to the rest of a train) and is not on an ascending grade, it will easily accelerate. On the other hand, if a long train is being started, the locomotive may stall as soon as some of the slack has been taken up, as the drag imposed by the train will exceed the tractive force being developed. An experienced engine driver will be able to recognize an incipient stall and will gradually advance the throttle as required to maintain the pace of acceleration.

As the throttle is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate to the prime mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and horsepower output. At the same time, main generator field excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This will translate into increased electrical output to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in tractive force. Eventually, depending on the requirements of the train&#x27;s schedule, the engine driver will have moved the throttle to the position of maximum power and will maintain it there until the train has accelerated to the desired speed.
The propulsion system is designed to produce maximum traction motor torque at start-up, which explains why modern locomotives are capable of starting trains weighing in excess of 15,000 tons, even on ascending grades. 
Current technology allows a locomotive to develop as much as 30% of its loaded driver weight in tractive force, amounting to of tractive force for a large, six-axle freight (goods) unit. 
In fact, a consist of such units can produce more than enough drawbar pull at start-up to damage or derail cars (if on a curve) or break couplers (the latter being referred to in North American railroad slang as &quot;jerking a lung&quot;). Therefore, it is incumbent upon the engine driver to carefully monitor the amount of power being applied at start-up to avoid damage. In particular, &quot;jerking a lung&quot; could be a calamitous matter if it were to occur on an ascending grade, except that the safety inherent in the correct operation of fail-safe automatic train brakes installed in wagons today prevents runaway trains by automatically applying the wagon brakes when train line air pressure drops.

====Propulsion system operation====


A locomotive&#x27;s control system is designed so that the main generator electrical power output is matched to any given engine speed. Given the innate characteristics of traction motors, as well as the way in which the motors are connected to the main generator, the generator will produce high current and low voltage at low locomotive speeds, gradually changing to low current and high voltage as the locomotive accelerates. Therefore, the net power produced by the locomotive will remain constant for any given throttle setting (&quot;see power curve graph for notch 8&quot;).

In older designs, the prime mover&#x27;s governor and a companion device, the load regulator, play a central role in the control system. The governor has two external inputs: requested engine speed, determined by the engine driver&#x27;s throttle setting, and actual engine speed (feedback). The governor has two external control outputs: fuel injector setting, which determines the engine fuel rate, and current regulator position, which affects main generator excitation. The governor also incorporates a separate overspeed protective mechanism that will immediately cut off the fuel supply to the injectors and sound an alarm in the cab in the event the prime mover exceeds a defined RPM. Not all of these inputs and outputs are necessarily electrical.
As the load on the engine changes, its rotational speed will also change. This is detected by the governor through a change in the engine speed feedback signal. The net effect is to adjust both the fuel rate and the load regulator position so that engine RPM and torque (and therefore power output) will remain constant for any given throttle setting, regardless of actual road speed.

In newer designs controlled by a &quot;traction computer,&quot; each engine speed step is allotted an appropriate power output, or &quot;kW reference&quot;, in software. The computer compares this value with actual main generator power output, or &quot;kW feedback&quot;, calculated from traction motor current and main generator voltage feedback values. The computer adjusts the feedback value to match the reference value by controlling the excitation of the main generator, as described above. The governor still has control of engine speed, but the load regulator no longer plays a central role in this type of control system. However, the load regulator is retained as a &quot;back-up&quot; in case of engine overload. Modern locomotives fitted with electronic fuel injection (EFI) may have no mechanical governor; however, a &quot;virtual&quot; load regulator and governor are retained with computer modules.

Traction motor performance is controlled either by varying the DC voltage output of the main generator, for DC motors, or by varying the frequency and voltage output of the VVVF for AC motors. With DC motors, various connection combinations are utilized to adapt the drive to varying operating conditions.

At standstill, main generator output is initially low voltage/high current, often in excess of 1000 amperes per motor at full power. When the locomotive is at or near standstill, current flow will be limited only by the DC resistance of the motor windings and interconnecting circuitry, as well as the capacity of the main generator itself. Torque in a series-wound motor is approximately proportional to the square of the current. Hence, the traction motors will produce their highest torque, causing the locomotive to develop maximum tractive effort, enabling it to overcome the inertia of the train. This effect is analogous to what happens in an automobile automatic transmission at start-up, where it is in first gear and thereby producing maximum torque multiplication.

As the locomotive accelerates, the now-rotating motor armatures will start to generate a counter-electromotive force (back EMF, meaning the motors are also trying to act as generators), which will oppose the output of the main generator and cause traction motor current to decrease. Main generator voltage will correspondingly increase in an attempt to maintain motor power but will eventually reach a plateau. At this point, the locomotive will essentially cease to accelerate, unless on a downgrade. Since this plateau will usually be reached at a speed substantially less than the maximum that may be desired, something must be done to change the drive characteristics to allow continued acceleration. This change is referred to as &quot;transition&quot;, a process that is analogous to shifting gears in an automobile.

Transition methods include:
* Series / Parallel or &quot;motor transition&quot;.
** Initially, pairs of motors are connected in series across the main generator. At higher speed, motors are reconnected in parallel across the main generator.
* &quot;Field shunting&quot;, &quot;field diverting&quot;, or &quot;weak fielding&quot;.
** Resistance is connected in parallel with the motor field. This has the effect of increasing the armature current, producing a corresponding increase in motor torque and speed.

Both methods may also be combined, to increase the operating speed range.
* Generator / rectifier transition
** Reconnecting the two separate internal main generator stator windings of two rectifiers from parallel to series to increase the output voltage.

In older locomotives, it was necessary for the engine driver to manually execute transition by use of a separate control. As an aid to performing transition at the right time, the load meter (an indicator that shows the engine driver how much current is being drawn by the traction motors) was calibrated to indicate at which points forward or backward transition should take place. Automatic transition was subsequently developed to produce better-operating efficiency and to protect the main generator and traction motors from overloading from improper transition.

Modern locomotives incorporate traction &quot;inverters&quot;, AC to DC, capable of delivering 1,200 volts (earlier traction &quot;generators&quot;, DC to DC, were capable of delivering only 600 volts). This improvement was accomplished largely through improvements in silicon diode technology. With the capability of delivering 1,200 volts to the traction motors, the need for &quot;transition&quot; was eliminated.

====Dynamic braking====

A common option on diesel–electric locomotives is dynamic (rheostatic) braking.

Dynamic braking takes advantage of the fact that the traction motor armatures are always rotating when the locomotive is in motion and that a motor can be made to act as a generator by separately exciting the field winding. When dynamic braking is used, the traction control circuits are configured as follows:
* The field winding of each traction motor is connected across the main generator.
* The armature of each traction motor is connected across a forced-air-cooled resistance grid (the dynamic braking grid) in the roof of the locomotive&#x27;s hood.
* The prime mover rotational speed is increased, and the main generator field is excited, causing a corresponding excitation of the traction motor fields.

The aggregate effect of the above is to cause each traction motor to generate electric power and dissipate it as heat in the dynamic braking grid. A fan connected across the grid provides forced-air cooling. Consequently, the fan is powered by the output of the traction motors and will tend to run faster and produce more airflow as more energy is applied to the grid.

Ultimately, the source of the energy dissipated in the dynamic braking grid is the motion of the locomotive as imparted to the traction motor armatures. Therefore, the traction motors impose drag and the locomotive acts as a brake. As speed decreases, the braking effect decays and usually becomes ineffective below approximately 16 km/h (10 mph), depending on the gear ratio between the traction motors and axles.

Dynamic braking is particularly beneficial when operating in mountainous regions, where there is always the danger of a runaway due to overheated friction brakes during descent. In such cases, dynamic brakes are usually applied in conjunction with the air brakes, the combined effect being referred to as blended braking. The use of blended braking can also assist in keeping the slack in a long train stretched as it crests a grade, helping to prevent a &quot;run-in&quot;, an abrupt bunching of train slack that can cause a derailment. Blended braking is also commonly used with commuter trains to reduce wear and tear on the mechanical brakes that is a natural result of the numerous stops such trains typically make during a run.

====Electro-diesel====
These special locomotives can operate as an electric locomotive or as a diesel locomotive. The Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad and New Jersey Transit Rail Operations operate dual-mode diesel–electric/third-rail (catenary on NJTransit) locomotives between non-electrified territory and New York City because of a local law banning diesel-powered locomotives in Manhattan tunnels. For the same reason, Amtrak operates a fleet of dual-mode locomotives in the New York area. British Rail operated dual diesel–electric/electric locomotives designed to run primarily as electric locomotives with reduced power available when running on diesel power. This allowed railway yards to remain unelectrified, as the third rail power system is extremely hazardous in a yard area.

===Diesel–hydraulic===
Diesel–hydraulic locomotives use one or more torque converters, in combination with fixed ratio gears. Drive shafts and gears form the final drive to convey the power from the torque converters to the wheels, and to effect reverse. The difference between hydraulic and mechanical systems is where the speed and torque is adjusted. In the mechanical transmission system that has multiple ratios such as in a gear box, if there is a hydraulic section, it is only to allow the engine to run when the train is too slow or stopped. In the hydraulic system, hydraulics are the primary system for adapting engine speed and torque to the train&#x27;s situation, with gear selection for only limited use, such as reverse gear.

====Hydrostatic transmission====
Hydraulic drive systems using a hydrostatic hydraulic drive system have been applied to rail use. Modern examples included shunting locomotives by Cockerill (Belgium), 4 to 12 tonne narrow gauge industrial locomotives by Atlas Copco subsidiary GIA. Hydrostatic drives are also utilised in railway maintenance machines (tampers, rail grinders).

Application of hydrostatic transmissions is generally limited to small shunting locomotives and rail maintenance equipment, as well as being used for non-tractive applications in diesel engines such as drives for traction motor fans.

====Hydrokinetic transmission====
Hydrokinetic transmission (also called hydrodynamic transmission) uses a torque converter. A torque converter consists of three main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the stator) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output rotational speeds. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission in an automobile. Another method is to provide several torque converters each with a range of variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.
====Locomotives====

Whilst diesel–electric (DE) locomotives were chosen around most of the world, a few countries turned toward Diesel Hydraulic (DH) locomotives instead, most notably Germany, Finland &amp; Japan, as well as Britain for a time.

The reasons for this were multiple, two of the more notable being that whilst most DH locomotives achieved about the same drivetrain efficiency as DEs of around ~85% (with some early British designs being the exception), they could at the same time be built noticeably lighter for the same total power output. This was the case as the hydraulic transmissions didn&#x27;t weigh nearly as much as the combination of generator(s) &amp; multiple electric traction motors necessary on a DE. 

The second notable advantage with DH locomotives, which lasted up until the introduction of modern traction control systems, was increased adhesion/traction per unit of weight. Normally on a DE locomotive every powered axle on a bogey features its own separate traction motor with no linkage between axles, and as such there is the potential that if one wheel loses grip and slips, this will cause the axle to spin faster independently from the others, resulting in a significant loss of overall traction. By contrast on a DH locomotive all the axles on each bogey are linked together via coupled drive shafts, and as such no single axle can begin to spin faster on its own should its wheels hit a slippery spot, greatly helping with traction. Prior to the introduction of effective traction control systems this technical difference alone could contribute anywhere between a 15–33% increase to the factor of adhesion for a diesel–hydraulic versus a diesel–electric locomotive. 

These two advantages were some of the main reasons why in the 1960&#x27;s three major US railroad companies, incl. Southern Pacific, initially expressed great interest in diesel hydraulic locomotive designs, eventually leading to the order and purchase of several West German ML4000 DH locomotives built specifically for the US by the firm Krauss Maffei. Reliability problems with these machines during high altitude operations with SP in the US, as well as the advent of domestic diesel engines of similar power levels coupled with an industry better suited for supporting diesel electric powertrains, however, meant that eventually interest in diesel hydraulics faded away in the US.

In Germany and Finland however, diesel–hydraulic systems achieved a very high reliability in operation, similar to or even better than DEs, which when coupled with the DHs aforementioned technical advantages helped make it the more popular type of diesel locomotive in these countries for a long time. Meanwhile in the UK the diesel–hydraulic principle gained a more mixed reputation.

By the 21st century, for diesel locomotive traction worldwide the majority of countries used diesel–electric designs, with diesel–hydraulic designs not found in use outside Germany, Finland and Japan, and some neighbouring states, where it is used in designs for freight work.

Diesel–hydraulic locomotives have a smaller market share than diesel electrics – the main worldwide user of main-line hydraulic transmissions has been the Federal Republic of Germany, with designs including the 1950s DB class V 200, and the 1960 and 1970s DB Class V 160 family. British Rail introduced a number of diesel–hydraulic designs during its 1955 Modernisation Plan, initially license-built versions of German designs (see Category:Diesel–hydraulic locomotives of Great Britain). In Spain, Renfe used high power to weight ratio twin-engine German designs to haul high speed trains from the 1960s to 1990s. (See Renfe Classes 340, 350, 352, 353, 354)

Other main-line locomotives of the post-war period included the 1950s GMD GMDH-1 experimental locomotives; the Henschel &amp; Son built South African Class 61-000; in the 1960s Southern Pacific bought 18 Krauss-Maffei KM ML-4000 diesel–hydraulic locomotives. The Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad also bought three, all of which were later sold to SP.

In Finland, over 200 Finnish-built VR class Dv12 and Dr14 diesel–hydraulics with Voith transmissions have been continuously used since the early 1960s. All units of Dr14 class and most units of Dv12 class are still in service. VR has abandoned some weak-conditioned units of 2700 series Dv12s.

In the 21st century series production standard gauge diesel–hydraulic designs include the Voith Gravita, ordered by Deutsche Bahn, and the Vossloh G2000 BB, G1206 and G1700 designs, all manufactured in Germany for freight use.

==== Multiple units ====
Diesel–hydraulic drive is common in multiple units, with various transmission designs used including Voith torque converters, and fluid couplings in combination with mechanical gearing.

The majority of British Rail&#x27;s second generation passenger DMU stock used hydraulic transmission. In the 21st century, designs using hydraulic transmission include Bombardier Turbostar, Talent, RegioSwinger families; diesel engined versions of the Siemens Desiro platform, and the Stadler Regio-Shuttle.

===Diesel–steam===
Steam–diesel hybrid locomotives can use steam generated from a boiler or diesel to power a piston engine. The &quot;Cristiani Compressed Steam System&quot; used a diesel engine to power a compressor to drive and recirculate steam produced by a boiler; effectively using steam as the power transmission medium, with the diesel engine being the prime mover.

===Diesel–pneumatic===
The diesel–pneumatic locomotive was of interest in the 1930s because it offered the possibility of converting existing steam locomotives to diesel operation. The frame and cylinders of the steam locomotive would be retained and the boiler would be replaced by a diesel engine driving an air compressor. The problem was low thermal efficiency, with the air compressor losing much heat to the environment. Attempts were made to compensate for this by using the diesel exhaust to re-heat the compressed air but these had limited success. A German proposal of 1929 did result in a prototype but a similar British proposal of 1932, to use an LNER Class R1 locomotive, never got beyond the design stage.

==Multiple-unit operation==

Most diesel locomotives are capable of multiple-unit operation (MU) as a means of increasing horsepower and tractive effort when hauling heavy trains. All North American locomotives, including export models, use a standardized AAR electrical control system interconnected by a 27-pin MU cable between the units. For UK-built locomotives, a number of incompatible control systems are used, but the most common is the Blue Star system, which is electro-pneumatic and fitted to most early diesel classes. A small number of types, typically higher-powered locomotives intended for passenger-only work, do not have multiple control systems. In all cases, the electrical control connections made common to all units in a consist are referred to as trainlines. 
The result is that all locomotives in a consist behave as one in response to the engine driver&#x27;s control movements.

The ability to couple diesel–electric locomotives in an MU fashion was first introduced in the EMC EA/EB of 1937. Electrical interconnections were made so one engine driver could operate the entire consist from the head-end unit.

In mountainous regions, it is common to interpose helper locomotives in the middle of the train, both to provide the extra power needed to ascend a grade and to limit the amount of stress applied to the draft gear of the car coupled to the head-end power. The helper units in such distributed power configurations are controlled from the lead unit&#x27;s cab through coded radio signals. Although this is technically not an MU configuration, the behaviour is the same as with physically interconnected units.

===Cab arrangements===
Cab arrangements vary by builder and operator. Practice in the U.S. has traditionally been for a cab at one end of the locomotive with limited visibility if the locomotive is not operated cab forward. This is not usually a problem as U.S. locomotives are usually operated in pairs, or threes, and arranged so that a cab is at each end of each set. European practice is usually for a cab at each end of the locomotive as trains are usually light enough to operate with one locomotive. Early U.S. practice was to add power units without cabs (booster or B units) and the arrangement was often A-B, A-A, A-B-A, A-B-B, or A-B-B-A where A was a unit with a cab. Center cabs were sometimes used for switch locomotives.

===Cow–calf===
In North American railroading, a cow–calf set is a pair of switcher-type locomotives: one (the cow) equipped with a driving cab, the other (the calf) without a cab, such that the pair can be controlled from the single cab. This arrangement is also known as &quot;master–slave&quot;. Cow–calf sets are used in heavy switching and hump yard service. Some are radio-controlled without an operating engineer present in the cab. Where two connected units were present, EMD called these &quot;TR-2s&quot; (with approximately ); where three units, &quot;TR-3s&quot; (with approximately ).

Cow–calves have largely disappeared as these engine combinations exceeded their economic lifetimes many years ago.

Present North American practice is to pair two 3,000hp GP40-2 or SD40-2 road switchers, often nearly worn-out and very soon ready for rebuilding or scrapping, and to utilize these for so-called &quot;transfer&quot; uses, for which the TR-2, TR-3 and TR-4 engines were originally intended, hence the designation &quot;TR&quot;, for &quot;transfer&quot;.

Occasionally, the second unit may have its prime mover and traction alternator removed and replaced by concrete or steel ballast and the power for traction obtained from a master unit. As a 16-cylinder prime mover generally weighs in the range, and a 3,000hp traction alternator generally weighs in the range, around would be needed for ballast.

A pair of fully capable &quot;Dash 2&quot; units would be rated . A Dash 2 pair in which only one had a prime-mover and alternator would be rated , with all power provided by the master, while the combination benefits from the tractive effort provided by the slave as engines in transfer service are seldom called upon to provide 3,000hp, much less 6,000hp, continuously.

==Fittings and appliances==

===Flame-proofing===
A standard diesel locomotive presents a very low fire risk but flame-proofing can reduce the risk even further. This involves fitting a water-filled box to the exhaust pipe to quench any red-hot carbon particles that may be emitted. Other precautions may include a fully insulated electrical system (neither side earthed to the frame) and all electric wiring enclosed in conduit.

The flameproof diesel locomotive has replaced the fireless steam locomotive in areas of high fire risk such as oil refineries and ammunition dumps. Preserved examples of flameproof diesel locomotives include:
* &quot;Francis Baily of Thatcham&quot; (ex-RAF Welford) at Southall Railway Centre
* &quot;Naworth&quot; (ex-National Coal Board) at the South Tynedale Railway
Latest development of the &quot;Flameproof Diesel Vehicle Applied New Exhaust Gas Dry Type Treatment System&quot; does not need the water supply.

===Lights===

The lights fitted to diesel locomotives vary from country to country. North American locomotives are fitted with two headlights (for safety in case one malfunctions) and a pair of ditch lights. The latter are fitted low down at the front and are designed to make the locomotive easily visible as it approaches a grade crossing. Older locomotives may be fitted with a Gyralite or Mars Light instead of the ditch lights.

==Environmental impact==
Although diesel locomotives generally emit less sulphur dioxide, a major pollutant to the environment, and greenhouse gases than steam locomotives, they still emit large amounts. Furthermore, like other diesel powered vehicles, they emit nitrogen oxides and fine particles, which are a risk to public health. In fact, in this last respect diesel locomotives may perform worse than steam locomotives.

For years, it was thought by American government scientists who measure air pollution that diesel locomotive engines were relatively clean and emitted far less health-threatening emissions than those of diesel trucks or other vehicles; however, the scientists discovered that because they used faulty estimates of the amount of fuel consumed by diesel locomotives, they grossly understated the amount of pollution generated annually. After revising their calculations, they concluded that the annual emissions of nitrogen oxide, a major ingredient in smog and acid rain, and soot would be by 2030 nearly twice what they originally assumed. In Europe, where most major railways have been electrified, there is less concern.

This would mean that in the USA diesel locomotives would be releasing more than 800,000tons of nitrogen oxide and 25,000tons of soot every year within a quarter of a century, in contrast to the EPA&#x27;s previous projections of 480,000tons of nitrogen dioxide and 12,000tons of soot. Since this was discovered, to reduce the effects of the diesel locomotive on humans (who are breathing the noxious emissions) and on plants and animals, it is considered practical to install traps in the diesel engines to reduce pollution levels and other methods of pollution control (e.g., use of biodiesel).

Diesel locomotive pollution has been of particular concern in the city of Chicago. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported levels of diesel soot inside locomotives leaving Chicago at levels hundreds of times above what is normally found on streets outside. Residents of several neighborhoods are most likely exposed to diesel emissions at levels several times higher than the national average for urban areas.

===Mitigation===
In 2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandated regulations requiring all new or refurbished diesel locomotives to meet Tier II pollution standards that slash the amount of allowable soot by 90% and require an 80% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions. &quot;See&quot; List of low emissions locomotives.

Other technologies that are being deployed to reduce diesel locomotive emissions and fuel consumption include &quot;Genset&quot; switching locomotives and hybrid Green Goat designs. Genset locomotives use multiple smaller high-speed diesel engines and generators (generator sets), rather than a single medium-speed diesel engine and a single generator. Because of the cost of developing clean engines, these smaller high-speed engines are based on already developed truck engines. Green Goats are a type of hybrid switching locomotive utilizing a small diesel engine and a large bank of rechargeable batteries. Switching locomotives are of particular concern as they typically operate in a limited area, often in or near urban centers, and spend much of their time idling. Both designs reduce pollution below EPA Tier II standards and cut or eliminate emissions during idle.

==Advantages over steam==
As diesel locomotives advanced, the cost of manufacturing and operating them dropped, and they became cheaper to own and operate than steam locomotives. In North America, steam locomotives were custom-made for specific railway routes, so economies of scale were difficult to achieve. Though more complex to produce with exacting manufacturing tolerances ( for diesel, compared with for steam), diesel locomotive parts were easier to mass-produce. Baldwin Locomotive Works offered almost 500 steam models in its heyday, while EMD offered fewer than ten diesel varieties. In the United Kingdom, British Railways built steam locomotives to standard designs from 1951 onwards. These included standard, interchangeable parts, making them cheaper to produce than the diesel locomotives then available. The capital cost per drawbar horse power was £13 6s (steam), £65 (diesel), £69 7s (turbine) and £17 13s (electric).

Diesel locomotives offer significant operating advantages over steam locomotives. They can safely be operated by one person, making them ideal for switching/shunting duties in yards (although for safety reasons many main-line diesel locomotives continue to have two-person crews: an engineer and a conductor/switchman) and the operating environment is much more attractive, being quieter, fully weatherproof and without the dirt and heat that is an inevitable part of operating a steam locomotive. Diesel locomotives can be worked in multiple with a single crew controlling multiple locomotives in a single train – something not practical with steam locomotives. This brought greater efficiencies to the operator, as individual locomotives could be relatively low-powered for use as a single unit on light duties but marshaled together to provide the power needed on a heavy train. With steam traction, a single very powerful and expensive locomotive was required for the heaviest trains, or the operator resorted to double heading with multiple locomotives and crews, a method which was also expensive and brought with it its own operating difficulties.

Diesel engines can be started and stopped almost instantly, meaning that a diesel locomotive has the potential to incur no fuel costs when not being used. However, it is still the practice of large North American railroads to use straight water as a coolant in diesel engines instead of coolants that incorporate anti-freezing properties; this results in diesel locomotives being left idling when parked in cold climates instead of being completely shut down. A diesel engine can be left idling unattended for hours or even days, especially since practically every diesel engine used in locomotives has systems that automatically shut the engine down if problems such as a loss of oil pressure or coolant loss occur. Automatic start/stop systems are available which monitor coolant and engine temperatures. When the unit is close to having its coolant freeze, the system restarts the diesel engine to warm the coolant and other systems.

Steam locomotives require intensive maintenance, lubrication, and cleaning before, during, and after use. Preparing and firing a steam locomotive for use from cold can take many hours. They can be kept in readiness between uses with a low fire, but this requires regular stoking and frequent attention to maintain the level of water in the boiler. This may be necessary to prevent the water in the boiler freezing in cold climates, so long as the water supply is not frozen. After use a steam locomotive requires a lengthy disposal operation to perform cleaning, inspection, maintenance and refilling with water and fuel before it is ready for its next duty. By contrast, as early as 1939 EMD was promoting its FT Series locomotive as needing no maintenance between 30-day inspections beyond refuelling and basic fluid level and safety checks which could be performed with the prime mover still running. Railways converting from steam to diesel operation in the 1940s and 1950s found that for a given period diesel locomotives were available for, on average, three or four times more revenue-earning hours than equivalent steam locomotives, allowing locomotive fleets to be cut drastically in size while maintaining operational capacity.

The maintenance and operational costs of steam locomotives were much higher than diesels. Annual maintenance costs for steam locomotives accounted for 25% of the initial purchase price. Spare parts were cast from wooden masters for specific locomotives. The sheer number of unique steam locomotives meant that there was no feasible way for spare-part inventories to be maintained. With diesel locomotives spare parts could be mass-produced and held in stock ready for use and many parts and sub-assemblies could be standardized across an operator&#x27;s fleet using different models of locomotive from the same builder. Modern diesel locomotive engines are designed to allow the power assemblies (systems of working parts and their block interfaces) to be replaced while keeping the main block in the locomotive, which greatly reduces the time that a locomotive is out of revenue-generating service when it requires maintenance.

Steam engines required large quantities of coal and water, which were expensive variable operating costs. Further, the thermal efficiency of steam was considerably less than that of diesel engines. Diesel&#x27;s theoretical studies demonstrated potential thermal efficiencies for a compression ignition engine of 36% (compared with 6–10% for steam), and an 1897 one-cylinder prototype operated at a remarkable 26% efficiency.

However, one study published in 1959 suggested that many of the comparisons between diesel and steam locomotives were made unfairly, mostly because diesels were a newer technology. After painstaking analysis of financial records and technological progress, the author found that if research had continued on steam technology instead of diesel, there would be negligible financial benefit in converting to diesel locomotion.

By the mid-1960s, diesel locomotives had effectively replaced steam locomotives where electric traction was not in use. Attempts to develop advanced steam technology continue in the 21st century but have not had a significant effect.

<text>Mahendra Pal Chaudhry (; born 9 February 1942) is a Fijian politician and the leader of the Fiji Labour Party. Following a historic election in which he defeated the long-time former leader, Sitiveni Rabuka, the former trade union leader became Fiji&#x27;s first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister on 19 May 1999, but exactly one year later, on 19 May 2000 he and most of his Cabinet were taken hostage in the Fiji coup of 2000 by coup leader George Speight. Unable to exercise his duties, he and his ministers were sacked by President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara on 27 May; Mara intended to assume emergency powers himself but was himself deposed by the military leader, Commodore Frank Bainimarama.

After 56 days in captivity, Chaudhry was released on 13 July and subsequently embarked on a tour of the world to rally support. He was one of the leading voices raised in opposition to the Qarase government&#x27;s proposed Reconciliation and Unity Commission, which he said was just a mechanism to grant amnesty to persons guilty of coup-related offences. In January 2007, he was appointed as Minister of Finance, Sugar Reform Public Enterprise and National Planning in the interim Cabinet of Commodore Frank Bainimarama, following another coup. Chaudhry was also co-chair of the task force focusing on economic growth within the National Council for Building a Better Fiji. In August 2008, he left the government and became an outspoken critic of it.

== Family background ==
Mahendra Chaudhry was born in an Indo-Fijian family in the town of Ba in Fiji. His paternal grandfather Ram Nath Chaudhry was from a Hindu family of the village of Bahu Jamalpur in Haryana, India (then the British Raj) and arrived in the British Colony of Fiji in 1902, as an indentured labourer, to work on Fiji&#x27;s sugarcane plantations. On his arrival in Fiji he disputed the agreement to work in the plantations and was employed as a store manager until he started his own business. He later returned to India with his wife, Ram Kalia, who died 22 September 1930 at the age of 45, and whom he had met and married in Fiji. His daughter, Raj Kumari also went to India with them. His sons Ram Gopal and Krishan Gopal Chaudhry remained in Fiji. Mahendra was Ram Gopal&#x27;s eldest son and one of his 15 children. Mahendra&#x27;s maternal grandfather was from the Indian state of Kerala, and had settled in Fiji in the early 1900s.

He worked as a government auditor, then as secretary of the Fiji Public Service Association during its 1973 strike, and later as vice-president of the Fiji Trades Union Congress. He also served on the board of the Fiji National Provident Fund until 1986.

In 2004, Chaudhry received the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, which is granted to members of the Indian diaspora to honor their contributions to the countries of which they are members. Chaudhry was the first Fijian citizen to receive this award.

== Political career ==

=== Cabinet member after 1987 election win ===
Chaudhry helped to launch the Fiji Labour Party in 1985, and served as its assistant secretary. The Labour got its first chance to test its popularity in the by-election for the North Central Indian National Seat in December 1985, following the resignation of Vijay R. Singh. FLP decided to field Mahendra Chaudhry, who was also the general secretary of the National Farmers Union, as its candidate. Chaudhry lost the election by only 204 votes.

He was elected to Parliament for the first time in the 1987 general election and appointed Minister of Finance and Economic Planning in the coalition government of Timoci Bavadra. This government held office for barely a month; on 14 May, Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka deposed the government in the first of two military coups. In the aftermath of the coup he was repeatedly detained by the military. In January 1988 in his role as PSA secretary he led a strike by Suva firefights, which the military regime declared illegal. He was subsequently elected general secretary of the FTUC, and in this role led union resistance to the military regime. In June 1988 he was detained by the police and interrogated over the seizure of several tons of Soviet-made weaponry, but no charges were laid. He subsequently warned the military regime that Australian and New Zealand unions would be asked to take action against Fiji if the harassment of unions continued.

In June 1990 he led the National Farmers Union of Fiji in a boycott of the sugar cane harvest, threatening international action if the army used force. Later that month he led opposition to the military&#x27;s draft constitution. His home was subsequently attacked by a gang of masked men, who smashed windows and damaged his car. In July 1991 he threatened a national strike by FTUC unions against the regime&#x27;s proposal to jail those disrupting essential industries; the threat was successful, and the regime&#x27;s industrial decree was revoked.

=== Leader of Labour Party from 1991 ===
Chaudhry remained active in the Labour Party, and assumed leadership of the party in 1991 from Adi Kuini Bavadra, widow of Timoci Bavadra who had died in 1989. In 1990 a new constitution had been imposed on Fiji by presidential decree. This constitution discriminated against the Indian community in seats allocated to it in the House of Representatives, by not guaranteeing any seats in the Senate and by restricting Indo-Fijians from holding prominent positions in the civil service. Both the NFP and FLP decided to boycott the elections scheduled for May 1992. At the last minute, the NFP decided to contest the election. Mahendra Chaudhry, then had no choice but to lead the FLP into the election. With little time to prepare for the campaign, the FLP managed to win only 13 of the 27 seats reserved for Indians.

After the election, Chaudhry made the controversial decision to support Sitiveni Rabuka in Parliament, in exchange for a promise to review the 1990 Constitution, which Fiji Indians generally regarded as discriminating against them. Rabuka did not follow through on the deal, and Chaudhry and the Labour Party were punished at the parliamentary election of 1994, losing 6 of their 13 seats.

In the mid-1990s, after Rabuka finally did agree to a constitutional review, Chaudhry led campaign to change the electoral system from one based on &quot;communal rolls&quot; (with parliamentary seats reserved by ethnicity, elected by voters enrolled as members of particular ethnic groups), to one based on universal suffrage. Eventually, a compromise formula was agreed upon. Meanwhile, the Rabuka government was losing popularity. His admissions of womanizing, together with allegations of corruption in his administration, alienated him from powerful sections of the electorate. Chaudhry, meanwhile, forged the People&#x27;s Coalition, an electoral alliance consisting of his Labour Party, and two other parties, both led by indigenous Fijians disaffected by Rabuka&#x27;s administration. Another indigenous-led party, the Christian Democratic Alliance, joined the coalition later.

=== The 1999 election and the 2000 coup===
The 1999 election resulted in a landslide win for the People&#x27;s Coalition, with 58 of the 71 seats in the House of Representatives. The Labour Party won an absolute majority, 37 seats, in its own right. From the outset, voices both within the coalition and without attempted to persuade Chaudhry to forego the office of Prime Minister in favour of an ethnic Fijian, such as his deputy Tupeni Baba or Adi Kuini Speed (by now, the leader of the Fijian Association Party, part of the People&#x27;s Coalition), but he refused. President Mara reportedly persuaded indigenous Fijian members of the coalition to accept Chaudhry&#x27;s leadership. Chaudhry was duly appointed Prime Minister on 19 May 1999. To shore up his support among the indigenous community, Chaudhry appointed indigenous Fijians to two-thirds of all ministerial positions.

Few in Chaudhry&#x27;s caucus had had any previous political experience, a factor that created difficulties for his government. Some Fijian nationalists opposed his administration and stirred up fears in the mostly rural ethnic Fijian population that land reform measures proposed by the Chaudhry government would expropriate their land (notwithstanding constitutional guarantees of indigenous control over five-sixths of the land, which could not be changed without the support of 9 of the 14 chiefly representatives in the Senate). Despite widespread fears of civil unrest, the takeover of the parliamentary complex by George Speight on 19 May 2000 (one year to the day since Chaudhry&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister) happened without warning.

More details concerning the overthrow of the Chaudhry government may be found in 2000 Fijian coup d&#x27;état and the linked Timeline, Mutinies, and Aftermath.

=== The election of 2001 and aftermath ===
When democracy was restored in 2001, Chaudhry fought a hotly contested election, but was defeated by Laisenia Qarase of the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL). It is thought that attrition within the Labour Party was a factor in his defeat; high-profile party members like Tupeni Baba had split to form the New Labour Unity Party and he had barely survived a leadership challenge. Mutual enmity between his party and the National Federation Party, the only other political party with significant Fiji-Indian support at that time, prevented a preference-swapping deal. In Fiji&#x27;s system of transferable voting, such a deal would almost certainly have made him Prime Minister again. (Fiji&#x27;s electoral laws, modelled at the time on those of Australia, allowed the votes of any two or more candidates in a particular constituency to be combined according to the candidates&#x27; preferences; voters could specify a different choice by ranking the candidates numerically in the order of their own preference).

Chaudhry rebuilt the Labour Party, which won several key by-elections throughout 2004. He challenged in the courts the refusal of the Qarase government to include his party in the Cabinet; on 18 July 2003, the Supreme Court ruled in his favour, saying that the exclusion of a party with more than 8 seats in the House of Representatives violated the Constitution. Appeals, counter-appeals, and negotiations delayed the appointment of Labour Ministers to the Cabinet, however. The Supreme Court subsequently ruled in June 2004 that the Labour Party was entitled to 14 out of 30 cabinet posts. Qarase announced that he would implement the order, but his refusal to include Chaudhry himself in any cabinet lineup continued to stall negotiations on the composition of the cabinet. Late in 2004, Chaudhry announced that the Labour Party had decided to remain in opposition for the remainder of the parliamentary term, seeing no way to resolve the impasse without making unacceptable compromises. By remaining outside of the government, the Labour Party was able to distance itself from unpopular decisions made by the administration, and position itself to challenge the ruling SDL for power in 2006.

=== 2006 general election ===

The Fiji Labour Party formed an electoral alliance with the Party of National Unity (PANU) and United Peoples Party (UPP) of Mick Beddoes to contest the 2006 general elections. The SDL Party of Prime Minister Qarase had joined a grand coalition of ethnic Fijian parties to unite the indigenous Fijian vote. During the election, the issue of race was again raised and this galvanised Fijian support behind Qarase. Although the FLP increased its share of votes to 39% and won four more seats to make a total of 31, it was unable to unseat the Qarase Government.

Chaudhry was criticised by some prominent members of the FLP, including Krishna Datt and Poseci Bune, for finalising his list of Senate nominees without consulting the Party. The Party threatened action against those members who spoke out publicly against Chaudhry.

Chaudhry&#x27;s decision that the Labour Party should join the multi-party cabinet (although Chaudhry himself did not join it), was a course for friction within the party. Prime Minister Qarase demanded that all cabinet members vote for the budget or face dismissal, but Chaudhry advised the Labour cabinet members to oppose it because of the increase in VAT tax. In the end four members voted against the budget while others were absent from Parliament.

===Participation in interim government===
Following the December 2006 coup that ousted Qarase, Chaudhry accepted the post of Minister of Finance in the interim government formed under Frank Bainimarama in January 2007.

Chaudhry resigned as Minister of Finance on 18 August 2008, along with the Labour Party&#x27;s two other ministers; Bainimarama took over Chaudhry&#x27;s portfolio. According to Chaudhry, they did so voluntarily in preparation for the planned general election, although Bainimarama said that &quot;there was a communication from me to [Chaudhry] about him resigning&quot;, while dismissing the issue&#x27;s importance. Prior to the resignation, there had already been widespread rumors that Bainimarama wanted to remove Chaudhry from the government.

Chaudhry defended his record as Finance Minister, saying that &quot;the value of our dollar today would have been about 20 cents had we not taken the measures that we took.&quot; While stating that Chaudhry&#x27;s resignation was a positive development, deposed Prime Minister Qarase was sharply critical of Chaudhry&#x27;s performance as Finance Minister, saying that he &quot;failed badly as Finance Minister and the economy has shown very little sign of progress. He&#x27;s just running away from the mess he has created.&quot; Qarase also condemned Chaudhry&#x27;s participation in what he described as &quot;an illegal administration&quot;.

Following the April 2009 constitutional crisis, Chaudhry spoke out to criticise the interim government, &quot;def[ying] a press and political crackdown on dissent&quot; in so doing. He described the abrogation of the Constitution as &quot;tragic and unfortunate&quot;, and Commodore Bainimarama&#x27;s leadership as &quot;autocratic and dictatorial&quot;, adding that it was now &quot;imperative&quot; to set up multi-party talks – involving Qarase and other leaders – to prepare a speedy restoration of democracy. In October 2010 he was arrested for &quot;meeting with sugar farmers in Rakiraki&quot;, in breach of the government&#x27;s &quot;emergency regulations that ban public meetings&quot;. In reporting on the arrest, the BBC described Chaudhry as &quot;one of the main opposition voices&quot; to the Bainimarama government; &quot;The Australian&quot; subsequently called him one of Bainimarama&#x27;s &quot;two most effective critics&quot; within Fiji, along with &quot;Fiji Times&quot; editor-in-chief Netani Rika.

===Elections in 2014===
In April 2014 Chaudhry was convicted of breaching the Exchange Control Act by investing money outside Fiji without informing the Reserve Bank, and fined US$1.1 million. The conviction meant he was ineligible to contest the upcoming 2014 elections. An appeal against his conviction was unsuccessful. Choudhry was nominated as an FLP candidate, but ruled to be ineligible. The Labour Party won only 2.4 percent of the vote, and no parliamentary seats, and Chaudhry joined the leaders of other opposition parties in alleging electoral fraud.

On 3 July 2015, Chaudhry was quoted by Radio New Zealand as announcing his retirement from the leadership of the FLP, having served in that capacity for 23 years. The next day, however, he denied having made such a statement.

In September 2016 he was one of a number of politicians arrested after attending a meeting to discuss the country&#x27;s constitution. He subsequently accused Fiji of still being a dictatorship. No charges were filed against anyone arrested.

He attempted to contest the 2018 election, but was ruled to be ineligible as a candidate due to his past criminal conviction. An appeal against the ruling was dismissed by the High Court of Fiji.

On 26 July 2021 he was taken in for questioning by Fijian police over comments he had made about a proposed government land bill.

He contested the 2022 election, winning 5760 votes, but did not win a seat as the Labour Party failed to make the 5% threshold.

== Chaudhry&#x27;s views and policies ==
Chaudhry is known for his combative style of leadership, which has won him both admirers and enemies.

=== Relationship with NFP ===
He remained at loggerheads with the National Federation Party, whose support dropped sharply in 1999, 2001 and 2006 elections, but continued to do well in local government elections. Although it would have been to his advantage to reach a deal on an exchange of preferences with the NFP, competition for support from Indian voters, particularly in the sugar cane growing areas, where FLP and NFP endorsed rival unions, prevented this.

=== Attracting ethnic Fijian vote ===
He failed to make significant inroads into the ethnic Fijian electorate, less than ten percent of whom voted for his party in 2001 or 2006. He was successful, however, in attracting several high-profile ethnic Fijians, such as Poseci Bune, to his party.

=== Brain drain ===
Chaudhry expressed alarm at the high rate of emigration from Fiji, especially of Fiji-Indians, and also of educated indigenous Fijians. &quot;If the trend continues, Fiji will be left with a large pool of poorly educated, unskilled work force with disastrous consequences on our social and economic infrastructure and levels of investment,&quot; he said in a statement on 19 June 2005. He blamed the coups of 1987 for &quot;brain drain&quot; which had, he said, had adversely affected the sugar industry, the standard of the education and health services, and the efficiency of the civil service. This was creating a vacuum that would lead to increased levels of crime, drug abuse, and money laundering, he considered. He lamented the &quot;indications of a growing feeling of insecurity, frustration and disaffection among people of all races at the direction in which Fiji appears to be headed,&quot; and said that only way to reverse the trend was to elect a government that would provide stability, raise living standards, and create a climate of confidence for investors and opportunities for job seekers.

=== Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill ===
From May–June 2005, Chaudhry was at the forefront of a campaign against the government&#x27;s controversial Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill, which proposes to establish a Commission with the power, subject to presidential approval, to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the 2000 coup. Speaking on 20 May, he said that a &quot;culture of coups&quot; had developed in Fiji and that it needed to be eradicated. Pardoning persons involved in the earlier coups of 1987 had been a serious mistake, he believed.

=== Bringing Fijians into the mainstream ===
Chaudhry also spoke in favour of bringing more ethnic Fijians into the economic mainstream. He attacked what he called the &quot;divide and rule&quot; policies of Fiji&#x27;s former British colonial rulers, saying that indigenous Fijians had been isolated from other communities and marginalized economically. This colonial legacy had remained the status quo in society, even since independence in 1970, he maintained. &quot;The status quo is not good for the ordinary Fijians. It is good for the elites in society but not for the ordinary Fijians,&quot; Chaudhry said. Positive discrimination programs would not achieve much without a dismantling of the traditional communal mindset, he said. He called for a more individualistic approach to society, based on incentives and appropriate training. He did not believe that modernization would threaten the communal structure of Fijian society. &quot;No you can still fulfil your traditional obligations but the contradiction in the system between the communal approach and the free market approach needs to be addressed,&quot; he said. He also insisted that culture could not be allowed to be stagnant.

=== Universal Declaration on Human Rights ===
He condemned Prime Minister Qarase for speaking against the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Qarase had told a meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Nadi the day before that western-style democracy was an alien concept in Fiji, and that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was not compatible with Fiji&#x27;s hierarchical order. Chaudhry countered by saying that Qarase was like a proverbial ostrich with its head in the sand. &quot;The rule of law must apply equally to everyone, irrespective of status in society or class divisions it is this equal application that is the bulwark of modern democracies,&quot; he said.

=== Calls for electoral reform ===
Chaudhry periodically called for Fiji&#x27;s electoral system to be reformed. He said on 20 November 2005 that communal voting, which reserved almost two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives for persons registered on ethnic electoral rolls, tended to polarize the nation and gave foundation to politicians with what he called extreme views. He said that any move to change this provision in the Constitution would be supported by the Opposition.

=== Gay rights ===
Chaudhry said on 18 October 2005 that he and the FLP would not support Prime Minister Qarase&#x27;s attempts to close constitutional loopholes that undermine Fiji&#x27;s anti-gay laws. Chaudhry said that gay rights were guaranteed by the constitution and must be upheld; the Prime Minister, who needed a two-thirds majority in Parliament to change the constitution, was just wasting his time trying to gain FLP support for the measure, he said.

=== Pro-business policies ===
Chaudhry also protested strongly against Qarase&#x27;s claims, made at the annual conference of Fiji Employers Federation on 2 September, that the Labour Party was unsympathetic to business and held &quot;a classic left-wing suspicion of ... the profit motive.&quot; Chaudhry countered that his party was in fact pro-business and had enacted a number of policies aimed at stimulating economic growth when it was in power. &quot;It was the FLP that was committed to reducing the cost of doing business and started by lowering the cost of utilities, and requested the commercial banks and lending organizations to reduce their fees, charges and interest rates ... that saw the economy record an unprecedented growth of 9.6% in 1999,&quot; Chaudhry declared. He said that in the five years of Qarase&#x27;s leadership, public debt had doubled to F$2.3 billion, that basic infrastructure had deteriorated, and that the economy was on the brink of collapse.

== Controversies ==
Chaudhry has been involved in a number of controversial circumstances over the years, ranging from a manslaughter conviction in 1978 to allegations of misuse of funds as recently as 2005.

=== 1978 conviction ===
In 1978, Chaudhry was involved in a fatal automobile accident and was convicted of failing to stop after a fatal accident. He was sentenced to nine months&#x27;s imprisonment, but was released on parole after serving 17 days of his sentence.

Prime Minister Qarase drew media attention to Chaudhry&#x27;s conviction and his almost immediate release, in response to Chaudhry&#x27;s criticism of government decisions to show leniency towards persons convicted of involvement in the 2000 coup, including former Vice-President &quot;Ratu&quot; Jope Seniloli and Cabinet Minister &quot;Ratu&quot; Naiqama Lalabalavu. Qarase accused Chaudhry and his supporters of &quot;living in glasshouses.&quot; Chaudhry pointed out that there was no comparison between a premeditated act of treason and a mere traffic offence.

=== Hate speech allegations ===
The Fiji Times reported on 4 September 2005 that Chaudhry and his principal opponent, Prime Minister Qarase, had traded mutual accusations of using hate speech to win political support.

=== Fundraising allegations ===
On 8 December 2005, Chaudhry announced his decision to sue Prime Minister Qarase and Fiji Television for defamation.

Addressing the House of Representatives on 23 November 2005, Prime Minister Qarase alleged that Chaudhry had had money raised for him in the Indian state of Haryana, and called on Chaudhry to reveal what had happened to the money since. On 2 December, he told Parliament that he was aware that money had been raised in his name in Haryana, but denied having authorized the appeal or receiving any of its proceeds. He had raised the issue with then Chief Minister of Haryana Om Prakash Chautala, he said, after being hounded by the media in both Fiji and India. He claimed to have discovered only during his 2005 visit to India that Chautala&#x27;s record with money is not transparent. &quot;My anger about the whole episode is that Shri Chautala should exploit the feelings of the ordinary and poor folks of Haryana who are emotionally tied to me and to the people of Indian origin in Fiji and play on them a game of deceit for self enrichment,&quot; Chaudhry said.

On 30 November, the Government of Haryana state ordered an investigation into the allegations. This followed reports in the Indian media that an Indian political party, the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), had raised over a million crore (F$376,557) for Chaudhry in 2001, who was then visiting India to raise support following his overthrow in the 2000 coup. According to &quot;Webindia&quot;, however, the money had not been delivered to him, because of currency regulations, and was instead deposited in the Oriental Bank of Commerce account of the &quot;Indo-Fiji Friendship Society&quot;. INLD Secretary General Ajay Singh Chautala, whose father Om Prakash Chautala was Chief Minister of Haryana at the time, welcomed the probe. The Haryana authorities were not mollified by his comments, and on 20 December &quot;Ranbir Singh Surjewala&quot;, the Haryana State Transport and Parliamentary Affairs Minister, called for the passports of Chautala and his two sons to be seized to prevent them from leaving the country.

It was announced on 7 December 2005 that India&#x27;s Bureau of Investigation had cleared Chaudhry of the allegations.

=== Sugar industry commission allegations ===
In another twist, Qarase had also declared on 25 November that he had unspecified &quot;evidence&quot;, which he claimed to have received from India, that a senior member of the FLP had attempted to get commissions from Indian companies that had applied for contracts with respect to the reform of Fiji&#x27;s sugar industry. He warned Chaudhry that he did not make unfounded allegations, and that he would use the evidence &quot;when the time comes.&quot; He later repeated the allegations outside of Parliament. Reacting angrily to the charges, Chaudhry threatened on 4 December to sue Qarase if he failed to apologize for or substantiate his claims. &quot;It is the Prime Minister&#x27;s duty to provide the evidence. These are serious allegations that have cast a slur on my integrity and reputation,&quot; he said. The following day, his son and lawyer, Rajendra Chaudhry, wrote to the Prime Minister giving him three days to apologize or else face a lawsuit. On 7 December, Qarase refused the ultimatum. &quot;I don&#x27;t apologize for nothing,&quot; the Fiji Times reported him as saying.

When the three-day deadline set by Chaudhry expired, he announced on 8 December that he would be suing Qarase as an individual, not as Prime Minister, meaning that Qarase would be unable to use state funds to fight his case. The writ, which named Qarase the first defendant, also named Fiji Television as the second defendant. &quot;Qarase had been reluctant to furnish evidence to substantiate his claims ... The imputations are very serious and a direct question on my integrity and leadership. As such I have had the resort to legal action,&quot; Chaudhry declared.

At the scheduled press conference on 9 December, the Prime Minister revealed a confidential letter from Mahendra Chaudhry, written on National Farmers Union (NFU) letterhead in his capacity as General Secretary of the Union, to Charles Walker, chairman of the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC), in September 2003. The letter proposed that the NFU purchase shares in the FSC, and stated that he, Senator Anand Singh, and United Consultancy of Auckland, New Zealand, were in talks with &quot;an India-based milling company&quot; to restructure the FSC. According to the Prime Minister, the deal would have transferred shares, that the government was considering selling, not to cane farmers but to their trade union representatives. &quot;The benefit was only to the NFU,&quot; Qarase said. Qarase called for an audit of the office of the Leader of the Opposition, saying that it would prove his connections to the Indian company. Equipment in Chaudhry&#x27;s office had been used to communicate with the company since 2002, he alleged.

Chaudhry derided the revelations as &quot;laughable,&quot; and said that they showed no connection whatsoever between himself and India&#x27;s Exim Bank, or with the Indian government loan. &quot;It was clear that having made wild baseless allegations, the PM was clutching at straws to try and validate his claims,&quot; Chaudhry said. &quot;There is absolutely no connection between the loan and a letter that I wrote to PM&#x27;s steering committee Charles Walker as chairman on sugar industry reforms that Qarase released to the media as his &#x27;proof&#x27; that I had received a commission from the loan,&quot; he added. Nor did it substantiate, he said, Qarase&#x27;s claims that he had sought a commission from the Indian companies.

Also on 9 December, FLP Senator and former Attorney-General Anand Singh announced his decision to sue the Indian government and the Head of the Indian Technical Mission, J.J. Bhagat, for compensation for providing the ideas, which he says were adopted without acknowledgement by the Fijian and Indian governments. Prime Minister Qarase had earlier alleged on 5 December that Chaudhry had been a party to the negotiations, and called on the FLP to reveal whether it was involved with Singh&#x27;s compensation claim.

On 14 December, High Court Justice Anthony Gates dismissed a call from Chaudhry to impose a gag order on Prime Minister Qarase, from making media statements until Chaudhry&#x27;s lawsuit is heard. Whether the Prime Minister&#x27;s statements were defamatory was an issue that would have to be resolved in the trial itself, Gates ruled; in the meantime, the court would not interfere with constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech. Chaudhry was ordered to pay F$750 to Qarase and Fiji Television Limited to cover court costs. 9 January 2006 has been set for the hearing of the defamation suit. Chaudhry had failed, Gates said, to provide &quot;credible evidence&quot; that Qarase&#x27;s words were untruthful, and therefore there was no grounds to prohibit their publication.

On 9 January 2006, Gates announced that he was withdrawing from the case against the Prime Minister and against Fiji Television. He was fully booked judging criminal cases, and had no time to devote to civil suits, he said.

Chaudhry released correspondence on 20 January 2006, citing it as proof that neither he nor his party had tried to collect a commission on Indian loans granted for sugar industry reform. The letter, from the Indian High Commission to Fiji, said that the Exim Bank had confirmed that there was no attempt to secure a commission on the loan, and that the bank never pays commissions on loans. In reply, the Prime Minister said that a number of unanswered questions remained, which would be addressed when the case was heard in court.

Chaudhry announced on 27 February that as of 16 January, he had withdrawn his case against Fiji Television, but not against the Prime Minister.

=== Lawsuit against Daily Post ===
On 5 December 2005, lawyer Rajendra Chaudhry filed a writ against the Daily Post, on behalf of his father, Fiji Labour Party (FLP) leader Mahendra Chaudhry. The writ against the government-owned newspaper, whose editor Mesake Koroi is a cousin of Prime Minister Qarase&#x27;s, concerns what Chaudhry claims are &quot;untrue and malicious&quot; allegations, suggesting a leadership struggle within the FLP. The article in question also claimed that the FLP was no longer the party founded by Timoci Bavadra, Tupeni Baba, and Adi Kuini Speed, but had turned into a hard-line Indian nationalist party.

=== Abuse of privilege investigation ===
It was revealed on 23 December 2005 that Auditor-General Eroni Vatuloka was investigating a complaint from Prime Minister Qarase, accusing Chaudhry of abuse of office. The Prime Minister alleges that Chaudhry has allowed Senator Anand Singh to use office equipment for commercial purposes. Chaudhry has dismissed the Prime Minister&#x27;s complaint as &quot;frivolous&quot; and &quot;childish.&quot;

Fiji Television revealed on 31 January 2006 that the National Farmers Union had put the parliamentary telephone number on a letter faxed to a business client, and that the letter was signed by Shareen Prasad, an employee at the FLP parliamentary office. Chaudhry again refused to comment on the claims, saying they were &quot;trivial.&quot;

Pramod Rae, General Secretary of the National Federation Party (NFP), the chief rival of the FLP for the Indo-Fijian vote, called for a thorough investigation into the allegations.

=== Support for Sun Myung Moon ===
Chaudhry was registered as an advisor to the Inter-Religious Federation For World Peace International, an organization affiliated with the Unification Church. The Fijian government abruptly revoked permission for Sun Myung Moon, the group&#x27;s 85-year-old founder, to visit Fiji, where he was to be the keynote speaker at a conference in Nadi. Dr. Lesi Korovavala, Chief Executive Officer of the Immigration Department described Moon&#x27;s doctrines as &quot;misleading, repugnant and divisive,&quot; said that his visit would not be conducive to &quot;peace, good order, public safety and public morality,&quot; and concluded that he was &quot;not a fit and proper person to enter the country.&quot;

Chaudhry slammed the government decision, saying that it was treating Moon like a terrorist or a criminal. &quot;Rev Dr. Moon is not a criminal or a terrorist to be treated in this manner,&quot; Chaudhry said. &quot;He is a man dedicated to a mission of peace through the promotion of moral and spiritual values. He has founded an organisation that believes in the inculcation of moral and family values to bring about better global understanding and harmony.&quot; Chaudhry was joined by Senate President Taito Waqavakatoga, registered as a coordinator of the group, who said that Moon would have made a positive contribution to Fiji.

== Tax allegations ==
Chaudhry was cleared of any taxation breaches after the Inquiry team brought over from Australia studied the evidence and documents provided by the FIRCA, stating that Mr Chaudhry had not breached any taxation laws. The tax assessment by FIRCA with respect to Chaudhry between 2000 and 2006 was carried out in accordance with the Tax Act and other relevant tax laws in Fiji. The inquiry team was headed by Bruce Cowley a partner in the law firm Minter Ellison in Brisbane, Russel Postle a partner in the accounting firm of BDO Kendalls, also in Brisbane, and former deputy PM, Taufa Vakatale.

<text>Abitibi Canyon was a community on the Abitibi River in northeastern Ontario, Canada. Abitibi Canyon was part of Northern Unorganized Cochrane District, in Cochrane District. It was located northeast of Fraserdale.

==History==
The construction of the Abitibi Canyon Generating Station at Abitibi Canyon began in 1930 for the Ontario Power Service Corporation, a subsidiary of the Abitibi Power and Paper Company, today&#x27;s Resolute Forest Products. Work was suspended several years later, the company went into receivership and the project was taken over by the provincial Ontario Hydro in 1933.

The Abitibi Canyon settlement was established in 1930 to support the construction of the dam. In early years, construction and later support staff came by Ontario Northland Railway train to Fraserdale, then further by private siding, or used floatplanes. In 1966, a road connection via Fraserdale to Smooth Rock Falls, Ontario was built, designated today as Highway 634. In the early 1960s Ontario Hydro released a documentary, &quot;Call of the Canyon&quot;, about the community and the construction of this road.

In 1940s, 130 people lived in the Ontario Hydro settlement, which rose to 300 by 1982. However, in 1980, Ontario Hydro decided to close the community as a cost-saving measure.

==Climate==
Island Falls is a weather station located approximately 36 km (22.4 miles) to the south of Abitibi Canyon. Island Falls has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) bordering on a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;).

<text>Richard Coates (born 16 April 1949, in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, and educated at Wintringham School) is an English linguist. He was Professor of Linguistics (alternatively Professor of Onomastics) at the University of the West of England, Bristol, now emeritus. From 1977 to 2006 he taught at the University of Sussex, where he served as Professor of Linguistics (1991–2006) and as Dean of the School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences (1998–2003). From 1980 to 1989 he was assistant secretary and then secretary of the Linguistics Association of Great Britain. He was honorary director of the Survey of English Place-Names from 2003 to 2019, having previously (1997–2002) served as president of the English Place-Name Society which conducts the Survey, resuming this role from 2019 to 2024. From 2002 to 2008, he was secretary of the International Council of Onomastic Sciences, a body devoted to the promotion of the study of names, and elected as one of its two vice-presidents from 2011 to 2017. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1992 and of the Royal Society of Arts in 2001.

His main academic interests are proper names (both from the historical and the theoretical perspective), historical linguistics in general, the philology of the Germanic, Romance and Celtic languages, regional variation in language, and local history. He is editor of the Survey of English Place-Names for Hampshire and was principal investigator of the AHRC-funded project Family Names of the United Kingdom (FaNUK), running from 2010 to 2016, of which Patrick Hanks was lead researcher.

He has written books on the names of the Channel Islands, the local place-names of St Kilda, Hampshire and Sussex, the dialect of Sussex, and, with Andrew Breeze, on Celtic place-names in England, as well as over 500 academic articles, notes, and collections on related topics. His main contribution to linguistic theory is The Pragmatic Theory of Properhood, set out in a number of articles since 2000.

He is also the author of &quot;Word Structure&quot;, a student&#x27;s introduction to linguistic morphology (Routledge), and of online resources on Shakespeare&#x27;s character-names and on the place-names of Hayling Island.

<doc id="389974" wikidata="Q57340" url="?curid=389974" title="Mswati III">
<text>Mswati III (born Makhosetive Dlamini; 19 April 1968) is the &quot;Ngwenyama&quot; (King) of Eswatini and head of the Swazi royal family. He heads an absolute monarchy, as he has veto power over all branches of government and is constitutionally immune from prosecution.

He was born in Manzini in the Protectorate of Swaziland to King Sobhuza II and one of his younger wives, Ntfombi Tfwala. He was crowned as Mswati III, Ingwenyama and King of Swaziland, on 25 April 1986 at the age of 18, thus becoming the youngest ruling monarch in the world at that time.

With unrestricted political power and able to rule by decree, Mswati III (together with his mother, Ntfombi Tfwala, now Queen Mother [&quot;Ndlovukati&quot;]) is the last remaining absolute monarch in Africa and one of the only 12 remaining absolute national or subnational monarchs in the world. Under the constitution, the king is the commander-in-chief of the defence force and commissioner-in-chief of police and correctional services and Mswati III exercises ultimate authority over all branches of the national government and effectively controls local governance through his influence over traditional chiefs.

Under his reign, political dissent and civic and labor activism are subject to harsh punishment under sedition and other laws. Political parties have been banned in Eswatini since 1973 when King Sobhuza II declared a state of emergency that has continued ever since. Pro-democracy protests from 2021 onwards have been violently dispersed and political activists have been arrested. The government exercises total control over the broadcast media, including the only privately owned TV channel, which belongs to the royal family. Almost all media outlets are controlled, directly or indirectly, by Mswati III.

Mswati III lives an opulent and lavish lifestyle which stands in sharp contrast to the lives of most Emaswazi people. In 2022, an estimated 32% of the population lived below the $2.15/day international poverty line (measured by price-purchasing parity (PPP) in 2017) while 55% of the population was under the lower-middle-income country poverty line of $3.65/day. Mswati III is known for his practice of polygamy (although at least two wives are appointed by the state) and currently has 16 wives. Formerly named Swaziland, in 2018 Mswati III renamed the country Eswatini (formally the Kingdom of Eswatini) by decree.

==Early life==
Mswati III was born on 19 April 1968 at Raleigh Fitkin Memorial Hospital, Manzini, the son of Sobhuza II (who had 70 wives during his reign of 82 years).

When King Sobhuza II died on 21 August 1982, the Great Council of State (the &quot;Liqoqo&quot;) selected the 14-year-old prince Makhosetive to be the next king.

==Reign period==

Mswati was introduced as crown prince in September 1983 and was crowned king on 25 April 1986, aged 18 years and 6 days, thus making him one of the youngest reigning monarchs of the late 20th century,

Today King Mswati III is Africa&#x27;s last absolute monarch in the sense that he has the power to choose the prime minister, other top government posts and top traditional posts. Despite his role in appointing such positions, Mswati is still required to get special advice from the queen mother and council when choosing positions such as prime minister; similarly, in matters of cabinet appointments, Mswati is advised by the prime minister. Mswati ruled by decree, but he chose to restore the nation&#x27;s Parliament, which had been dissolved by his father in order to ensure concentration of power remained with the king. Parliamentarians are appointed either by Mswati himself (two-thirds of the senators and ten deputies) or elected by traditional chiefs close to power. Close to the evangelical churches, he banned divorce and the wearing of miniskirts.

In 2006, Mswati promulgated a new constitution that allows freedom of speech and assembly. However, Amnesty International criticizes that such freedoms are restricted in practice.

In an attempt to mitigate the HIV and AIDS pandemic in 2001, the king used his traditional powers to invoke a time-honoured chastity rite (&quot;umcwasho&quot;) under the patronage of a princess, which encouraged all Swazi maidens to abstain from sexual relations for five years. This was last done under Sobhuza II in 1971. This rite banned sexual relations for Swazis under 18 years of age from 9 September 2001 to 19 August 2005, but just two months after imposing the ban, he violated this decree when a 17-year-old &quot;liphovela&quot; (royal fiancée) was chosen, who became his 13th wife.

Mswati has visited Taiwan seventeen times as of June 2018, and has promised to continue recognizing Taiwan instead of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Eswatini is predominantly rural and is one of the poorest countries in the world (63% of its population lives below the poverty line). An economic circle of 15,000 businessmen controls most of the country&#x27;s wealth. This circle includes South African investors who have come to Eswatini to find labour at one-third the cost and a group of white businessmen who are heirs to the British settlers.

In January 2021, Mswati contracted COVID-19, and he later thanked Taiwan for providing antiviral medication that helped with his recovery. Mswati did not disclose that he had been hospitalized until after his recovery.

In June 2021, the 2021 Eswatini protests broke out against authoritarianism and the suppression of opposition. The Communist Party of Swaziland alleged he had fled to South Africa on the night of 28–29 June, whereas the Swaziland Solidarity Network claimed he fled to Mozambique. Both of these claims were denied by acting prime minister Themba Nhlanganiso Masuku.

== Wives and succession ==


The king currently has 16 wives and 45 children. The first two wives are chosen for him by the national councillors. There are complex rules on succession. Traditionally the king is chosen through his mother as represented in the Swazi saying &quot;Inkhosi, yinkhosi ngenina&quot;, meaning &quot;a king is king through his mother&quot;.

==Controversies==
Mswati&#x27;s reign has brought some changes in the government and political transformation. However, critics such as the People&#x27;s United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO) believe that these changes are solely aimed at strengthening and perpetuating the traditional order. His attendance at the May 2012 Sovereign Monarchs lunch, to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, caused some controversy, given criticisms of his regime&#x27;s human rights record.

Mswati&#x27;s reign has been criticized for its several alleged human rights violations. His regime has been accused of using torture and excessive force to control the masses as well as blatant discrimination against various dissenting groups. His regime has been accused of extrajudicial killings by his forces, along with arbitrary arrests, detentions, and unwarranted searches and seizures of homes and property. His government has restricted freedom of speech, assembly and association, and has harassed activists and journalists. The government has reportedly targeted the LGBT community, labour leaders, and activists against child labour, among other groups. The courts took little or no action to punish Mswati&#x27;s actions or the officials who committed the abuses.

Mswati has been accused of kidnapping women he desires to marry. In addition, in 2000 he allegedly called for a parliamentary meeting to debate if HIV-positive people should be &quot;sterilized and branded&quot;.

===Wealth===

Mswati has been criticized for his lavish lifestyle, especially by the media; in one report he was accused of living a luxurious lifestyle while the people of his country starve. In the 2014 national budget, parliament allocated $61 million (US) for the King&#x27;s annual household budget, while 63% of Swazis live on less than $1.25 per day. Mswati banned photography of his automobiles after he was criticized for purchasing luxury cars, such as a $500,000 DaimlerChrysler Maybach 62. According to the Forbes 2009 list of the World&#x27;s 15 Richest Royals, King Mswati is worth a reported $200 million. In January 2004 the &quot;Times of Swaziland&quot; reported that the king asked his government to spend about $15-million to redecorate three main palaces and build others for each of his 11 wives. The Prime Minister&#x27;s Office issued a press statement saying the article in the &quot;Times of Swaziland&quot; was &quot;reckless and untrue&quot; and that the proposal was for the construction of 5 State Houses, not Palaces, and the cost was only €19.9 million. Later that year the go-ahead was given to build five new buildings at a cost of more than $4-million out of public funds. In August 2008, hundreds of Swazi women marched through the capital to protest the cost of a shopping spree taken abroad by nine of the King&#x27;s thirteen wives. The demonstration was organised by Positive Living, a non-governmental organisation for Swazi women with AIDS, and protesters submitted a petition to the finance minister arguing that the money should have been differently spent.

Mswati owns a collection of bespoke watches worth millions of dollars.

Mswati has a personal stake in a large portion of Eswatini&#x27;s economy which is a factor in its below-average economic growth for a Sub-Saharan nation. As an absolute monarch, he holds the power to dissolve parties, and can veto any legislation parliament passes.

===LaMahlangu controversy===

According to accusations by Amnesty International, Zena Mahlangu, an 18-year-old high school student, disappeared from her school in October 2002. Her mother, Lindiwe Dlamini, learned that her daughter had been taken by two men, Qethuka Sgombeni Dlamini and Tulujani Sikhondze, and she reported the matter to the police. Some time later, she was told that her daughter was at Ludzidzini Royal Village and was being prepared to be the next wife of the king.

Among the criteria for a &quot;liphovela&quot; (future bride) is that the girl must not be a twin; Zena Mahlangu was half of a brother-sister twin set, and therefore not eligible. The matter went to the High Court, but Swaziland&#x27;s Attorney-General Phesheya Dlamini intervened.

== Country name change ==
On 19 April 2018, King Mswati III changed the name of the country from Swaziland to Eswatini to mark its 50th anniversary of independence. The name change coincided with the king&#x27;s birthday. The actual anniversary took place on 6 September, though in the same year. Eswatini is the ancient, original name for the country, chosen as a departure from its colonial past.

<doc id="389975" wikidata="Q524267" url="?curid=389975" title="Frogger">
<text>is a 1981 arcade action game developed by Konami and published by Sega. In North America, it was distributed by Sega/Gremlin. The object of the game is to direct five frogs to their homes by dodging traffic on a busy road, then crossing a river by jumping on floating logs and alligators.

&quot;Frogger&quot; was positively received as one of the greatest video games ever made. It was followed by numerous clones and several home-only sequels in the &quot;Frogger&quot; series. The 1982 Atari 2600 version from Parker Brothers sold 4 million cartridges, making it one of the best-selling Atari 2600 games. By 2005, 20 million copies of its various home video game incarnations had been sold worldwide.

==Gameplay==
The objective of the game is to guide a frog to each of the empty homes at the top of the screen. The game starts with three, five, or seven frogs, depending on the machine&#x27;s settings. Losing all frogs is game over. The player uses the 4-direction joystick to hop the frog once. &quot;Frogger&quot; is either single-player or two players alternating turns.

The frog starts at the bottom of the screen, which contains a horizontal road occupied by speeding vehicles such as race cars, dune buggies, trucks, and bulldozers. The player must guide the frog between opposing lanes of traffic to avoid becoming roadkill and losing a life. After crossing the road, a median strip separates the two major parts of the screen. The upper half consists of a river with logs, alligators, and turtles, all moving horizontally across the screen in opposite directions. By jumping on swiftly moving logs and the backs of alligators and turtles, the player can guide the frog to safety. The player must avoid snakes, otters, and the open mouths of alligators. A brightly colored female frog is sometimes on a log and may be carried for bonus points. The very top of the screen contains five &quot;frog homes&quot;, and at least one is always open and available. These sometimes contain bonus insects or deadly alligators.

When all five frogs are in their homes, the game progresses to the next level with increased difficulty. After five levels, the difficulty briefly eases and yet again progressively increases after each level. The timer gives 30 seconds to guide each frog into one of the homes, and resets back to 60 ticks whenever a life is lost or a frog reaches home safely.

In 1982, &quot;Softline&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Frogger&quot; has earned the ominous distinction of being &#x27;the arcade game with the most ways to die&#x27;.&quot; There are many different ways to lose a life (illustrated by a skull and crossbones symbol where the frog was), including being run over by a road vehicle; jumping into the river; running into snakes, otters, or an alligator&#x27;s jaws; sinking while on top of a diving turtle; riding a log, alligator, or turtle off the side of the screen; jumping into a home already occupied by a frog or alligator; jumping into the side of a home or the bush; or running out of time.

The opening tune is the first verse of a Japanese children&#x27;s song called &quot;Inu No Omawarisan&quot; (&quot;The Dog Policeman&quot;). Other Japanese tunes include the themes to the anime series &quot;Hana no Ko Lunlun&quot; and &quot;Rascal the Raccoon&quot;. The American release has the same opening song plus &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;.

===Scoring===
Every forward step scores ten points, and every frog arriving safely home scores 50 points. Ten points are also awarded per each unused ½ second of time. Guiding a lady frog home or eating a fly scores 200 points each, and when all five frogs reach home to end the level the player earns 1,000 points. A single bonus frog is given at 20,000 points. 99,990 points is the maximum high score that can be achieved on an original arcade cabinet. Players may exceed this score, but the game &quot;rolls over&quot; and only keeps the last 5 digits.

==Release==
The game was developed by Konami. On July 22, 1981, Sega gained the exclusive rights to manufacture the game worldwide.

===North America===
Sega/Gremlin was skeptical about &quot;Frogger&quot;″s earning potential in North America. This was because no other company licensed the game. Also, an earlier game called &quot;Frogs&quot; that was developed there had flopped. It was believed that &quot;Eliminator&quot; would be the company&#x27;s next big hit. Elizabeth Falconer, a market researcher at Sega/Gremlin, was tasked by Gremlin founder Frank Fogleman to check Gremlin&#x27;s library of video presentations to see if there was anything worth licensing, and she stumbled across &quot;Frogger&quot;.

Thinking the game deserved a chance though being &quot;cute&quot;, she requested a licensing window for playtesting. She persuaded executives who denigrated &quot;Frogger&quot; as a &quot;women and kids game&quot; by reminding them of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. Sega/Gremlin agreed to pay Konami $3,500 per day for a 60-day licensing window. A prototype was playtested in a San Diego bar and was so successful that distributors agreed to resell the game based on the test alone.

Wanting to broaden the player base demographics, Jack Gordon, the director of video game sales at Sega/Gremlin, noted that women shied away from the &quot;shoot em&#x27; ups&quot; on the market and that games like &quot;Frogger&quot; &quot;filled the void&quot;.

==Ports==

&quot;Frogger&quot; was ported to many contemporary home systems. Several platforms such as the Commodore 64 support both ROM cartridges and magnetic media, so they received multiple versions of the game.

Sierra On-Line gained the magnetic media rights and sublicensed them to developers who published for systems not normally supported by Sierra. Cornsoft published the official TRS-80/Dragon 32, Timex Sinclair 1000, and Timex Sinclair 2068 ports. Because of that, even the Atari 2600 received multiple releases: a standard cartridge and a cassette for the Starpath Supercharger. Sierra released disk or tape versions for the Commodore 64, Apple II, original Macintosh, IBM PC and Supercharger-equipped 2600, and cartridge versions for the TRS-80 Color Computer

Parker Brothers received the license from Sega for cartridge versions which it released for the Atari 2600, Intellivision, Atari 5200, ColecoVision, Atari 8-bit computers, TI-99/4A, VIC-20 and Commodore 64. Parker Brothers spent $10 million on advertising &quot;Frogger&quot;. The Atari 2600 version was programmed by Ed English.

Coleco released stand-alone Mini-Arcade tabletop versions of &quot;Frogger&quot;, which, along with &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Galaxian&quot;, and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, had three million sales combined.

The game was ported to systems such as the PC-6001 and Game Boy (with two separate releases for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color in 1998). &quot;Frogger&quot; is one of the 6 launch games for the 1983 Gakken Compact Vision TV Boy.

==Reception==
Reporting on Gordon&#x27;s claim that &quot;Frogger&quot;″s appeal lacked barriers of age or sex, &quot;Cashbox&quot; in October 1981 said &quot;watch for it&quot;. Distributors reportedly found that Gordon&#x27;s statement was accurate, with women enjoying its &quot;non-aggressive yet challenging&quot; gameplay. &quot;Frogger&quot;″s success increased production, becoming one of the top-grossing arcade games in North America during 1981. The arcade game earned over (equivalent to $ in ) for Sega/Gremlin in US cabinet sales, becoming the most successful Sega/Gremlin release. In Japan, &quot;Frogger&quot; was the 12th highest-grossing arcade game of 1981.

Home versions of &quot;Frogger&quot; had high sales. The 1982 Atari 2600 version earned its publisher Parker Brothers in orders upon launch. By the end of the year, Atari 2600 cartridges were sold with in wholesale revenue. It became the company&#x27;s most successful first-year product, beating the sales and revenues of its previous best-seller, &quot;Merlin&quot;. By 2005, copies of the various home versions had been sold worldwide, including in the United States.

In 1981, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewed the arcade game as &quot;one of the popular new generation of arcade games which are getting way from space themes&quot;. In his 1982 book &quot;Video Invaders&quot;, Steve Bloom described &quot;Frogger&quot; as a &quot;climbing game&quot; along with &quot;Space Panic&quot; (1980) and Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981). He said it was one of the &quot;most exciting variations&quot; on &quot;Pac-Man&quot;″s maze theme along with &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; due to how players need to &quot;scale from the bottom of the screen to the top&quot; which make them &quot;more like obstacle courses than mazes&quot; since &quot;you always know where you&#x27;re going—up.&quot; Brett Alan Weiss of &quot;AllGame&quot; later reviewed the arcade game, calling it one of &quot;the most beloved videogames ever created&quot; and &quot;pure, undiluted gaming at its finest&quot;. He said the &quot;graphics are cute and detailed, the sound effects are crisp and clear, and the controls are sharp and responsive&quot;.

&quot;Arcade Express&quot; reviewed the Atari VCS version in 1982, calling it &quot;a highly authentic translation of the coin-op hit&quot; that combines &quot;great graphics with sophisticated play action&quot;. Ed Driscoll reviewed the Atari VCS version in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot;, commenting: &quot;All in all, if you liked the arcade version, this should save you a lot of quarters. The price is in line with most cartridges. It also proves that Atari isn&#x27;t the only one making home versions of the major arcade games for the VCS.&quot; Danny Goodman of &quot;Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games&quot; wrote in 1983 that the Atari 2600 version &quot;is one of the most detailed translations I have seen&quot;, noting the addition of the wraparound screen. &quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot; cited the Sierra version as an entertaining arcade game. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; said that both the Sierra disk version and Parker Brothers cartridge version for the Commodore 64 &quot;are excellent, with little to choose between them&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Frogger&quot; one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600.

==Legacy==
===Remakes and sequels===
In 1997, Hasbro Interactive released &quot;Frogger&quot;, a vastly expanded remake of the original for Windows and the PlayStation. Unlike the original, it consists of multiple different levels. It was a commercial success, with Windows sales alone at nearly one million units in less than four months. In 1998, Hasbro released a series of versions of the game for the Sega Genesis, Super NES, Game com, Game Boy and Game Boy Color. Each version has different graphics, with the Genesis version having the same as the original arcade game. The Genesis and SNES versions are the last games released for those consoles in North America. Though using the same box art, they are otherwise unrelated to the 1997 remake.

In 2005, InfoSpace worked with Konami Digital Entertainment to create the mobile game &quot;Frogger for Prizes&quot;, in which players across the U.S. competed in multiplayer tournaments to win daily and weekly prizes. In 2006, the mobile game version of &quot;Frogger&quot; grossed over $10 million in the United States. A Java version was released for compatible mobile phones.

&quot;Frogger&quot; was released on the Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 on July 12, 2006. It was developed by Digital Eclipse and published by Konami. It has two new gameplay modes: versus speed mode and co-op play. Some of the music was replaced, including the familiar &quot;Frogger&quot; theme. This version is in the compilation &quot;Konami Classics Vol. 1&quot;.

The original 1981 arcade version joined the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; on December 12, 2019.

===Clones===
Video game clones include &quot;Ribbit&quot; for the Apple II (1981), Acornsoft&#x27;s &quot;Hopper&quot; (1983) for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron, A&amp;F Software&#x27;s &quot;Frogger&quot; (1983) for BBC Micro and ZX Spectrum, PSS&#x27;s (Personal Software Services) &quot;Hopper&quot; for the Oric-1 in the UK (1983) and a later release for the ORIC Atmos, &quot;Froggy&quot; for the ZX Spectrum released by DJL Software (1984), Solo Software&#x27;s &quot;Frogger&quot; for the Sharp MZ-700 (1984) in the UK, and &quot;Leap Frog&quot; for the NewBrain.

Several clones retain the basic gameplay of &quot;Frogger&quot; and change the style or plot. &quot;Pacific Coast Highway&quot; (1982), for the Atari 8-bit computers, splits the gameplay into two alternating screens: one for the highway, one for the water. &quot;Preppie!&quot; (1982), for the Atari 8-bit changes the frog to a preppy retrieving golf balls at a country club. &quot;Frostbite&quot; (1983), for the Atari 2600, uses the &quot;Frogger&quot; river gameplay with an arctic theme. &quot;Crossy Road&quot; (2014), for iOS, Android and Windows Phone, has a randomly generated series of road and river sections in one endless level, with only one life and a single point given for each forward hop.

===In popular culture===
*In 1983, &quot;Frogger&quot; made its animated television debut as a segment on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot; cartoon lineup. Frogger, voiced by Bob Sarlatte, worked as an investigative reporter.
*The hardcore punk band Bad Religion recorded a song titled &quot;Frogger&quot;, included on their 1985 EP Back to the Known, which uses the game as a metaphor to describe the traffic in the band&#x27;s hometown of Los Angeles. The song even opens with a sample of the game&#x27;s theme music.
*In the 1998 &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Frogger&quot;, Jerry and George visit a soon-to-be-closed pizzeria they frequented as teenagers and discover the &quot;Frogger&quot; machine still in place, with George&#x27;s decade-old high score still recorded.
*&quot;Frogger&quot; appears in the films &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, &quot;Pixels&quot; and &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;.
*A scene in the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; episode &quot;Cyborg the Barbarian&quot; parodies the game.
*In 2006, a group in Austin, Texas, used a modified Roomba dressed as &quot;Frogger&quot; to play a real-life version of the game.
*In science, Frogger is the name given to a transposon (&quot;jumping gene&quot;) family in the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;.
*In 2008, the City of Melbourne created a spin-off called &quot;Grogger&quot; as part of a public service campaign to encourage people to take safe transportation home after a night of drinking.

===Game show===
Konami announced that a &quot;Frogger&quot; game show was in production for Peacock, produced by Konami Cross Media NY and Eureka Productions. It debuted on September 9, 2021.

==Competition==
On November 26, 1999, Rickey&#x27;s World Famous Sauce offered $10,000 to the first person who could score 1,000,000 points on &quot;Frogger&quot; or $1,000 for a new world record prior to January 1, 2000. On March 25, 2005, Robert Mruczek offered $1,000 for beating the fictitious world record of 860,630 as set by George Costanza in an episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; or $250 for a new world record by the end of that year. On December 1, 2006, John Cunningham offered $250 for exceeding the same fictitious world record of 860,630 points by February 28, 2007. These scores were surpassed only after the bounties had all expired.

The first and only score to have been verified as having beaten George Costanza&#x27;s fictional score of 860,630 points was set by Pat Laffaye of Westport, Connecticut on December 22, 2009, with 896,980 points. He continues to be the current &quot;Frogger&quot; world record holder, who on August 15, 2017 set a new personal best by scoring 1,029,990 points, also becoming the first and only person verified to break one million points on an original arcade machine.

<doc id="389986" wikidata="Q4673892" url="?curid=389986" title="Achray, Ontario">
<text>Achray is an unincorporated place and former railway point in geographic Stratton Township in the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District in northeastern Ontario, Canada. It lies in northern Algonquin Provincial Park on the northern shore of Grand Lake, part of the Barron River system, and functions today as a campground site.

It was originally a station with a passing track on the main line of the Canadian Northern Railway, between Hydro to the west and Kathmore to the east, later taken over by Canadian National Railway as the CN Beachburg Subdivision and now abandoned in the park. Once a major centre for park administration, only a small complement of backcountry rangers still operates out of Achray. The old park operations centre is now a cinema/interpretive centre and the bunk house is now a tourist lodge at the canoe rental place on the Achray Road.

Tom Thomson&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Jack Pine&quot;, was inspired by the scenery in this area. Thomson worked as a fire ranger at Achray in 1916. The cabin in which Thomson is reputed to have lived in now has some exhibits on the park history and Tom Thomson.

The campground has 45 campsites without electricity. Facilities are considered to be primitive compared to other campgrounds located in the park. The central park store is the former Deputy Chief Ranger Headquarters that was built in the 1930s by park rangers, Claude McFarland, an expert stonemason, and William Mooney, a skilled carpenter. It was built with stone quarried on the opposite shore of Grand Lake.

Achray has two hiking trails, including the small interpretive Berm Lake Trail, and the longer Eastern Pines Backpacking Trail that leads to a waterfall on the Barron River as it exits Stratton Lake.

The campground is a common starting point for multiday canoe trips on the Barren River to the Barron Canyon.

<doc id="389987" wikidata="Q520362" url="?curid=389987" title="Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)">
<text>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints—usually distinguished with a parenthetical (Strangite)—is one of the several organizations that claim to be the legitimate continuation of the church founded by Joseph Smith on April 6, 1830. It is a separate organization from the considerably larger and better known Utah-based church: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Both churches claim to be the original organization established by Joseph Smith. The Strangite church is headquartered in Voree, Wisconsin, just outside Burlington, and accepts the claims of James Strang as successor to Smith. It had approximately 300 members in 1998. An undated FAQ on the church&#x27;s official website reports there are around 130 active members throughout the United States.

After Smith was murdered in 1844 with no clear successor, several claimants sought to take leadership of the church which Smith founded. Among them was Strang, who competed with other prominent members, notably Brigham Young and Sidney Rigdon.

At its peak, the Strangite Church had about 12,000 members, making them noteworthy rivals to the larger faction led by Brigham Young. Strang was murdered in 1856, after which most of his followers joined Joseph Smith III and his Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, now called the Community of Christ.

==History==
===Before Strang===
Strangites share the same history with other Latter Day Saint denominations up until the assassination of Joseph Smith. During the resulting succession crisis, several early Mormon leaders asserted claims to succeed Smith, including Sidney Rigdon, Brigham Young and James Strang. Rigdon&#x27;s claim rested on his status as the senior surviving member of Smith&#x27;s First Presidency, the church&#x27;s highest leadership quorum. Rejected by the main church body in Nauvoo, Illinois, Rigdon and his followers moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his organization faltered. A descendant of the Rigdonite church lives on today as The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), which is not recognized as legitimate by Strangites.

Brigham Young initially argued that Smith could have no immediate successor, but rather that the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (of which he was president) should be sustained as the presiding body of the church. Young and his followers migrated west to the Salt Lake Valley, in what became Utah Territory, continuing to use &quot;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot; as their name until incorporating in 1851, when the spelling was standardized as &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;.

===James Strang&#x27;s appointment letter and the Voree plates===

Although he was a relatively recent convert at the time of Smith&#x27;s death, James Strang posed a formidable—and initially quite successful—challenge to the claims of Young and Rigdon. Strang was a Mormon elder charged with establishing a stake or &quot;place of refuge&quot; in Wisconsin, should the Mormons be forced to abandon their headquarters in Nauvoo. He possessed a document that came to be known as the &quot;letter of appointment&quot;, alleged to have been written by Smith prior to his death. Critics assert the handwriting of the letter does not graphologically resemble any extant letters written by Smith. Furthermore, wording in the letter was ambiguous; some insist that it only appointed Strang to be president of the new Voree Stake of the church, while Strang and his followers interpreted it as a call to follow Smith as President of the Church. Strang also claimed at the moment of Smith&#x27;s death, he was visited by angels who ordained him to be Smith&#x27;s successor, though he claimed no other witnesses to the event.
Strang&#x27;s assertion appealed to many Latter Day Saints who were attracted to Mormonism&#x27;s doctrine of continuing revelation through a living prophet. In the face of protracted Mormon anguish at Smith&#x27;s death, Strang insisted that there still &quot;was&quot;, indeed, a Mormon seer who communed with God and conversed with angels. Strang&#x27;s claim was bolstered by his discovery of the Voree plates, purporting to contain the last testament of an ancient Native American, one &quot;Rajah Manchou of Vorito&quot;. These plates were found in the Hill of Promise, which would become the temple site in the new Strangite town of Voree. This event was reminiscent of Smith&#x27;s translations of the golden plates (the Book of Mormon) and the Book of Abraham, and may have encouraged some Latter Day Saints to accept Strang over any of his competitors, who had not produced any such &quot;records&quot;.

===Early successes and losses===
Many prominent Latter Day Saints believed in Strang&#x27;s &quot;letter of appointment&quot; and accepted him as Mormonism&#x27;s second &quot;Prophet, Seer, Revelator and Translator&quot;—at least in the short term. These included the church&#x27;s Presiding Patriarch and apostle William Smith (Smith&#x27;s only surviving brother); Book of Mormon witness Martin Harris (who left and later rejoined the LDS Church in Utah); Nauvoo Stake President William Marks; second Bishop of the Church and church trustee-in-trust George Miller; apostle John E. Page; former apostle William E. McLellin; Smith&#x27;s mother Lucy Mack Smith; and other members of the Smith family.

Another adherent was John C. Bennett, former mayor of Nauvoo and a former member of the First Presidency. Bennett had been in Smith&#x27;s innermost circle but had broken with the founding prophet and had written an anti-Mormon exposé. Bennett founded a secretive Strangite fraternal society known as the &quot;Order of Illuminati&quot;, but his presence disrupted Strang&#x27;s church and ultimately led to his excommunication. Bennett&#x27;s &quot;order&quot; fell by the wayside and no longer exists among the Strangites.

All of these persons—with the exception of Miller, who would remain loyal to Strang until death—left the Strangite church by 1850. Many of these defections were due to Strang&#x27;s seemingly abrupt &quot;about-face&quot; on the turbulent subject of polygamy. Vehemently opposed to the practice at first, Strang reversed course in 1849 to become one of plural marriage&#x27;s strongest advocates. Since many of his early disciples had looked to him as a monogamous counterweight to Young&#x27;s polygamous version of Mormonism, Strang&#x27;s decision to embrace plural marriage proved costly to him and his church.

Strang found his greatest support among the scattered outlying branches of Mormonism, which he frequently toured. His followers may have numbered as many as 12,000, at a time when Young&#x27;s group had just over 50,000. After Strang won a debate at a conference in Norway, Illinois, he converted the entire branch. While in Voree, the Strangites published a periodical known as the &quot;Voree Herald&quot;. Strang&#x27;s church also fielded a mission to England, one of the primary sources of converts to Mormonism. This mission was led by Martin Harris, the financier of the Book of Mormon and one of its Three Witnesses. Harris proved a poor spokesman, however, and the English missions sided with the LDS Church led by Young.

===Establishing a kingdom on Beaver Island===
Because the high price of land in the Voree area made it difficult for Latter Day Saints to &quot;gather&quot; there, Strang moved his church headquarters to Beaver Island in Lake Michigan. Here his disciples founded a town known as St. James (now St. James Township), and in 1850, openly established an ecclesiastical monarchy with Strang as the spiritual &quot;king&quot; of his church. The date of his coronation, July 8, is still mandated as one of the two most important days in the Strangite church calendar (the other is April 6, the anniversary of the founding of Smith&#x27;s church).

Contrary to popular belief, Strang never claimed to be king over Beaver Island, or any other geographical entity. Rather, he asserted that he was king over his church, which he saw as the one, true &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; prophesied in scripture and destined to spread over all the earth. The constitution of this kingdom was contained within the Book of the Law of the Lord, which Strang claimed to have translated from the Plates of Laban mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Originally published in 1851, this new book of Strangite scripture would be republished in a greatly expanded edition in 1856, just after Strang&#x27;s murder. The book is still revered by Strangites today, remaining a vital part of their canon of scripture.

In addition to printing religious materials, the Strangite printing press on Beaver Island became the source of a new periodical, the &quot;Northern Islander&quot;, which was the first real newspaper in all of northern Michigan. As St. James became an entrepôt for Great Lakes shipping, the Strangites began to compete with more established commercial lake ports such as Mackinac Island. Tensions grew between Mormons on Beaver Island and their non-Mormon neighbors, which frequently exploded into violence. Accusations of thuggery and thievery were leveled by both parties against each other, compounded by ever-increasing dissension among some of Strang&#x27;s own disciples, who chafed at what they saw as his increasingly tyrannical rule.

In 1854, Strang published &quot;Ancient and modern Michilimackinac, including an account of the controversy between Mackinac and the Mormons&quot;. Dale Morgan, a historian of the Latter Day Saint movement, writes: &quot;Strang surveys the geography and history of Mackinac and the surrounding region, particularly the islands of Lake Michigan, and after giving an account of the Mormon settlement upon Big Beaver Island, addresses himself to the bitter controversies between the people of Mackinac and the Mormons. Although dealing with controverted matters and colored by Strang&#x27;s indignation at the outrages he and his people had to endure, the pamphlet is a responsible source on the events of which it treats, and is also interesting for the considerable measure of learning it reveals in Strang&quot;.

Tensions finally came to a head on June 20, 1856, when two Strangite malcontents shot Strang in the back, leading to his death three weeks later. Since Strang refused to appoint a successor, and insisted that the next Strangite prophet must be chosen and ordained by angels just as he and Smith had been, Strang&#x27;s church was left leaderless and vulnerable. One day before his death, vigilantes from Mackinac Island and other Lake Michigan communities converged on Beaver Island. The Strangites were rounded up, forced onto hastily commandeered steamships, and removed from the island. Most were simply dumped onto docks in Chicago and Green Bay, destitute and deprived of all their property.

===After Strang===
Strang&#x27;s death and the loss of his Beaver Island settlement were twin catastrophes for his church. Despondent and spiritually adrift after the Strangite organization failed to provide a successor for Strang, most Strangites eventually chose to join what was then known as the &quot;New Organization&quot; of Latter Day Saints. This group had chosen not to follow Young and would eventually accept the leadership of Joseph Smith III, eldest son of Smith. This &quot;New Organization&quot; was later incorporated as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, becoming the second-largest body in the Latter Day Saint movement.

A few congregations of Strangites, however, remained loyal to their prophet&#x27;s memory. Wingfield W. Watson, a high priest who had known and served under Strang, kept the Strangite church alive into the 20th century. Strang&#x27;s disciples today are divided into two main factions; one is led by a Presiding High Priest, who does not claim to have the authority or office possessed by Smith or Strang. The other claims that this first assemblage is in error, and that by incorporating in 1961 and allegedly organizing a new order of the priesthood to rule them and a new man-made set of laws to govern them, it lost its identity as a faithful continuation of Strang&#x27;s organization. This second group claims that it is the sole true remnant of Strang&#x27;s church.

The first group no longer emphasizes missionary work, as they tend to believe that after three murdered prophets (Smith, Hyrum Smith, and Strang), God closed his dispensation to the &quot;gentiles&quot; of the West. Consequently, this group&#x27;s congregation remains small. Current membership figures vary between 50 and 300 persons, depending upon the source consulted.

There are two groups among the second. One group has a website based in Independence, Missouri, and the second has a website based in Shreveport, Louisiana. Both conduct missionary work on the Internet.

==Scriptures==
The Strangites &quot;believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; [and] also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God,&quot; just as do most other Latter Day Saint denominations. They consider editions of the Doctrine and Covenants published prior to Smith&#x27;s death (which contained the Lectures on Faith) to be scripture.

Strangites hold the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible to be inspired, but do not believe modern publications of the text are accurate, so they &quot;cautiously use the publication of his earliest corrections published as the &#x27;Inspired Version&#x27; or &#x27;Joseph Smith Translation&#x27; by the sons of Joseph Smith in Plano, Ill., 1867.&quot; Strangites do not have any official stance on the Book of Abraham.

Strang&#x27;s Book of the Law of the Lord is accepted as scripture in its expanded 1856 form; it is believed to be the same &quot;Book of the Law of the Lord&quot; mentioned in the Bible, and Strang claimed to have translated it from the Plates of Laban mentioned in the Book of Mormon.

The Strangites also hold as scripture several prophecies, visions, revelations, and translations printed by Strang, and published in the &quot;Revelations of James J. Strang&quot;. This text contains his purported &quot;letter of appointment&quot; from Smith and his translation of the Voree plates. The Book of Jasher was consistently used by both Smith and Strang, but as with other Latter Day Saint denominations, there is no official stance on its authenticity and it is not considered canonical.

==Doctrines==

===Monarchy and priesthood===
One distinctive difference between Strangites and other Latter Day Saints concerns the singular subdivisions Strang makes within the Melchizedek priesthood, which his Book of the Law refers to as &quot;The Priesthood of an endless life,&quot; and the Aaronic priesthood, referred to as &quot;the Priesthood of life.&quot;

In the Melchizedek priesthood, Strang enumerates two &quot;orders,&quot; that of &quot;Apostles,&quot; and that of &quot;Priests.&quot;

Apostles are subdivided into four &quot;degrees&quot;:
*The Prophet/President of the Strangite church is openly referred to throughout the book as a &quot;King,&quot; rather than as a &quot;President&quot;.
*The President&#x27;s Counselors are designated as &quot;Viceroys.&quot; Viceroys are referred to as &quot;kings,&quot; too, though this does not indicate a share in the unique royal dignity accorded to the President/King.
*Strang&#x27;s Twelve Apostles are named as &quot;Princes in his Kingdom forever.&quot; The leader of Strang&#x27;s Apostles is designated as &quot;Prince and Grand Master of the Seventies.&quot;
*A quorum of &quot;Evangelists&quot; (not to be confused with the office of Patriarch) is established, to be Apostles to a single &quot;nation, kindred, tongue or people&quot;—unlike the Twelve, who were sent to all nations. Seven Evangelists form a quorum, and Strang noted that such a body had never been organized &quot;in this dispensation&quot; (and nor did Strang organize one). This is a unique priesthood office in the Latter Day Saint movement.

Priests are subdivided into two &quot;degrees&quot;:
*High Priests are to include &quot;all inferiour Kings, Patriarchs, or heads of tribes, and Nobles, or heads of clans.&quot; Furthermore, Strang continued, &quot;They who hold it are called Sons of God.&quot; From this group, said the Book of the Law, the king is to select &quot;counsellors, judges and rulers.&quot; Furthermore, the Book of the Law limits consecration of the Eucharist to High Priests and Apostles, as opposed to other Latter Day Saint sects, who follow the Doctrine and Covenants in permitting Elders and Priests also to do so.
*The &quot;degree&quot; of Elder includes both the offices of Seventy and Elder as generally constituted in Smith&#x27;s church.

In the Aaronic priesthood, Strang enumerates three &quot;orders&quot;:
*Priests are subdivided into two &quot;courses&quot;: Sacrificators and Singers. The course of Singers is opened to women. Each temple is to have a Chief Priest, assisted by a first and second High Priest. Strangite &quot;Sacrificators&quot; are to kill sacrifices in accordance with appropriate provisions of the Book of the Law. Female priests are specifically barred from killing sacrifices. The Doctrine and Covenants functions of preaching and baptizing are retained as well.
*Teachers are subdivided into five &quot;degrees&quot;: Rabboni, Rabbi, Doctor, Ruler, and Teacher. This office, like that of Priest, is open to women. Teachers are not merely to instruct in spiritual matters, but in secular ones as well. They are to staff schools throughout the kingdom.
*Deacons are subdivided into three &quot;degrees&quot;: Marshals, Stewards and Ministers. They are to serve as &quot;Stewards and keepers of the King&#x27;s prisons, and Stewards of the King&#x27;s Courts.&quot;

In addition, a &quot;King&#x27;s Council&quot; and a &quot;King&#x27;s Court&quot; are established, though none function within the Strangite church today. While no direct link is made between the King&#x27;s Court and the &quot;High Council&quot; established in the Doctrine and Covenants, certain parallels exist, such as requiring all members to hold the High Priesthood, and limiting their number to twelve.

Although Strang briefly retained the services of Apostle William Smith as &quot;Chief Patriarch&quot; of his church, he makes no mention of this office anywhere in his book.

No Apostles (of any degree) exist within the Strangite organization today, as all must be appointed by a Strangite prophet, and the prophet himself must be appointed by God through the direct ministry of angels. The &quot;incorporated&quot; group of Strangites has high priests, but the &quot;non-incorporated&quot; group does not, insisting that the first body does not currently possess authority to ordain any. Both factions enjoy the ministry of Elders and Aaronic Priesthood offices.

===The Decalogue===
Another unique feature of Strangite doctrine is its singular version of the Ten Commandments. The Strangite Decalogue differs from any other Jewish, Catholic, Islamic or Protestant version, by including the commandment: &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot;

While not in the list of commandments, this admonition appears in the Hebrew Bible in Leviticus 19:18, and five times in the New Testament. In his &quot;Note on the Decalogue,&quot; Strang asserted that no other version of the Decalogue contains more than nine commandments and speculated that his fourth commandment was lost perhaps as early as Josephus&#x27; time (circa 37–100 AD). Strang&#x27;s version of the Decalogue (together with the rest of his teaching) are rejected by all non-Strangite Latter-day Saint factions, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The full text of the fourth commandment according to the Strangites reads:Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: thou shalt not revile him, nor speak evil of him, nor curse him: thou shalt do no injustice unto him; and thou shalt maintain his right, against his enemy: thou shalt not exact rigorously of him, nor turn aside from relieving him: thou shalt deliver him from the snare and the pit, and shalt return his ox when he strayeth: thou shalt comfort him when he mourns, and nurture him when he sickens: thou shalt not abate the price of what thou buyest of him, for his necessity; nor shalt thou exact of him, because he leaneth upon thee: for in so doing thousands shall rise up and call thee blessed, and the Lord thy God shall strengthen thee in all the work of thy hand.

===Ordination of women===
As noted above, the Strangite organization opens two priesthood offices to women: Priest and Teacher. While only the &quot;course&quot; of &quot;Singer&quot; in the office of Priest (as opposed to &quot;Sacrificator&quot;) is permitted to females, all five &quot;degrees&quot; in the office of Teacher are available. Women may serve as &quot;leaders&quot; of the Singers. Strang ordained women to these ministries as early as 1851, and allowed them to lecture in his School of the Prophets by 1856. Another denomination, the Community of Christ, began ordaining women to the priesthood in 1984, while most other Latter Day Saint churches do not ordain women to the priesthood.

===Animal sacrifice===
Animal sacrifice was instituted in the Strangite church under Strang&#x27;s leadership, primarily as a part of Strangite celebration rituals. Though the chapter on &quot;Sacrifices&quot; in Strang&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Law of the Lord&quot; speaks of them as being offered for sins, the prohibition on such sacrifices contained in 3 Nephi 9:19–20, meant that Strang focused instead on sacrifice as an element of religious festivities, especially the commemoration of his own coronation as king (July 8, 1850). The head of every house, from the king to his lowest subject, was to offer &quot;a heifer, or a lamb, or a dove. Every man a clean beast, or a clean fowl, according to his household.&quot;

The killing of sacrifices was a prerogative of Strangite Priests, but female Priests were specifically barred from participating in this aspect of the priestly office. &quot;Firstfruits&quot; offerings were also demanded from all Strangite agricultural harvests.

Animal sacrifices are no longer practiced by the Strangites, but belief in their correctness is still required.

===Monotheism and the vocation of Jesus Christ===
Strangites reject both the traditional Christian doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus Christ and the Mormon doctrine of plurality of gods. They insist that there is but one eternal God, the Father, and that alleged progression to godhood (a doctrine supposedly taught by Smith, but Strangites reject that assertion) is impossible. They believe that God has always been God, and he is one Person (not three, as in the traditional Christian Trinity).

Jesus Christ, Strangites believe, was the natural-born son of Mary and Joseph, who was chosen from before all time to be the Savior of mankind, but who had to be born as an ordinary mortal of two human parents (rather than being begotten by the Father or the Holy Spirit) to be able to truly fulfill his Messianic role. Strang claimed that the earthly Christ was in essence &quot;adopted&quot; as God&#x27;s son at birth, and fully revealed as such during the transfiguration. After proving himself to God by living a perfectly sinless life, he was thus enabled to provide an acceptable sacrifice for the sins of men, prior to his resurrection and ascension.

===Free agency===
Musing at length on the nature of sin and evil, Strang wrote that of all things that God could give to man, he could never give him &quot;experience&quot;. Thus, if &quot;free agency&quot; were to be real, humanity must be given the opportunity to fail and to learn from its own mistakes. The ultimate goal for each human being, according to Strangites, is to willingly conform oneself to the revealed character of God in every way, preferring good to evil not out of any fear of punishment or desire for reward, but rather &quot;on account of the innate loveliness of undefiled goodness; of pure unalloyed holiness.&quot;

===Sabbatarianism===
Strangites observe the seventh-day Sabbath—i.e., Saturday—as the Book of the Law commanded it, in lieu of Sunday.

===Baptism for the dead===
Strangites believe in baptism for the dead and practiced it to a limited extent in Voree and on Beaver Island. However, rather than simply baptizing for anyone whose name can be located, Strang required a revelation for those seeking to have a baptism done for someone outside of a close relative &quot;within the fourth degree of consanguinity&quot;. This could come through dreams, angelic appearances, or other means listed within Strang&#x27;s revelation on the subject. While still believed in, baptisms for the dead are not currently performed in the Strangite church due to the lack of a temple and prophetic leadership.

===Eternal marriage===
Eternal marriage is taught in the Strangite church, but unlike in the LDS Church, it is not required to be performed in a temple. Strangite Priests, Elders, High Priests or Apostles (of all four degrees) may perform this ceremony. Eternal marriages are still contracted among the Strangites today.

Same-sex marriage and homosexuality in general are not permitted within the Strangite organization.

===Conservation of resources===
Conservation of forests and resources is mandated by the Strangites. Within Strang&#x27;s Beaver Island kingdom and other places where Strangites were numerous, groves of trees were to be maintained upon each farm, village and town. Farms and cities without trees were required to plant them, and to establish parklands so that &quot;the aged and the young may go there to rest and to play.&quot; Although Strang&#x27;s kingdom has disappeared, his followers still endeavor to practice basic conservation measures.

===Polygamy===
Plural marriage is sanctioned but not expressly commanded, in the Book of the Law. The applicable text reads: &quot;Thou shalt not take unto thee a multitude of wives disproportioned to thy inheritance, and thy substance: nor shalt thou take wives to vex those thou hast; neither shalt thou put away one to take another.&quot; Any wife already married to the prospective polygamist was given the right to express her opinion, and even to object, but not to veto the marriage. This passage seems to offer any aggrieved wife an appeal to the &quot;Judges,&quot; but how this was to be carried out is not made clear.

Strang&#x27;s defense of polygamy was rather woman-centered. He claimed that far from enslaving or demeaning women, it liberated and &quot;elevated&quot; them by allowing them to choose the best possible mate based upon any factors deemed important to them even if that mate were already married to someone else. Rather than being forced to wed &quot;corrupt and degraded sires&quot; from the scarcity of more suitable men, a woman could wed the one she saw as the most compatible to herself, the best candidate to father her children and the man who could give her the best possible life, no matter how many other wives he might have.

The practice of plural marriage has never been officially proscribed in the Strangite church, unlike in the LDS Church. Only twenty-two men entered into polygamy, and most of them took only one additional wife. Strang took four additional wives, the most of any member in his church.

Polygamy was apparently practiced by a few Strangites up to 1880 or so, including by Wingfield W. Watson, a Strangite High Priest who knew and served under Strang. However, with federal and state bans on the practice, and a divine injunction to obey &quot;the law of the land,&quot; plural marriage has been given up in the contemporary Strangite organization, though belief in its correctness is still required and affirmed.

Strangites reject Section 132 of the LDS Church&#x27;s Doctrine and Covenants, regarding it as a forgery from 1852 that was never received or approved by Smith.

===Temples===
Strang began to construct a temple in Voree, but was prevented from completing it because of the poverty and the lack of co-operation of his followers. No &quot;endowment&quot; rituals comparable to those in the LDS Church appear to have existed among his followers, and Strangites believe that only a prophet of God has the ability to receive a revelation to direct the building of a Temple. Because there is no current prophet of the church, there are no current plans for the creation of a Temple.

===African Americans===
Strangites welcomed African Americans into their church when some other factions (such as the LDS Church, until 1978) denied them the priesthood or certain other benefits of membership. Strang ordained at least two African Americans to the eldership during his lifetime.

===Websites===
Three different websites exist for various branches of the Strangite church:
* Official website of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)
*Mormon Beliefs, unincorporated Strangites based in Shreveport, Louisiana
* Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)

===Publications===
These publications are believed in by all Strangites, regardless of faction:
*The Voree Plates A detailed description of the &quot;Voree Plates&quot; and the story behind them, from a Strangite point of view.
*Book of the Law of the Lord, Edition of 1851 First Edition, without Strang&#x27;s commentary.
*Book of the Law of the Lord, Edition of 1856 Second Edition of this work; contains Strang&#x27;s commentary and notes, also considered to be scripture by Strangites.
*The Revelations of James J. Strang contains text of &quot;Letter of Appointment&quot;, together with translation of the &quot;Voree Plates&quot; and other revelations given by Strang. Includes a facsimile of the &quot;plates&quot;.

<text>Venedic (&quot;Wenedyk&quot;, &quot;lęgwa wenedka&quot;) is a naturalistic constructed language, created by the Dutch translator Jan van Steenbergen (who also co-created the international auxiliary language Interslavic). It is used in the fictional &quot;Republic of the Two Crowns&quot;, based on the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in the alternate timeline of Ill Bethisad. Officially, Venedic is a descendant of Vulgar Latin with a strong Slavic admixture, based on the premise that the Roman Empire incorporated the ancestors of the Poles in their territory. Less officially, it tries to show what Polish would have looked like if it had been a Romance instead of a Slavic language. On the Internet, it is well-recognized as an example of the altlang genre, much like Brithenig and Breathanach.

The idea for the language was inspired by such languages as Brithenig and Breathanach, languages that bear a similar relationship to the Celtic languages as Venedic does to Polish. The language itself is based entirely on (Vulgar) Latin and Polish: all phonological, morphological, and syntactic changes that made Polish develop from Common Slavic are applied to Vulgar Latin. As a result, vocabulary and morphology are predominantly Romance in nature, whereas phonology, orthography and syntax are essentially the same as in Polish. Venedic uses the modern standard Polish orthography, including for and for .

Venedic plays a role in the alternate history of Ill Bethisad, where it is one of the official languages of the Republic of the Two Crowns. In 2005 Venedic underwent a major revision due to a better understanding of Latin and Slavic sound and grammar changes. In the process, the author was assisted by the Polish linguist Grzegorz Jagodziński.

The dictionary on the WWW page linked below contains over 4000 entries.

The language has acquired some media attention in Poland, including several online news articles and an article in the monthly &quot;&quot;.

== Spelling and pronunciation ==

Venedic uses the Polish alphabet, which consists of the following 32 letters :

:A Ą B C Ć D E Ę F G H I J K L Ł M N Ń O Ó P R S Ś T U W Y Z Ź Ż

Also, there are seven digraphs, representing five phonemes (ch being identical with h, and rz with ż):

:Ch Cz Dz Dź Dż Rz Sz

Pronunciation is exactly as in Polish. Stress almost always falls on the penultimate syllable. A preposition and a pronoun are generally treated as one word, and therefore, when the pronoun has only one syllable, the preposition is stressed.

(In theory, the construction of Venedic enables relatively easy construction of other &quot;Slavo-Romance&quot; languages. The Romance &quot;mirror&quot; for Czech, for example, is called &quot;Šležan&quot;; another for Slovak, although somewhat looser than the other two as it uses a partially Hungarian orthography, is called &quot;Slevan&quot;. )

== Nominals ==
Venedic does not have articles. This is a feature that distinguishes Venedic from all natural Romance languages. The reason for this is that Vulgar Latin showed only a rudimentary tendency toward the formation of articles, and they are absent in Polish and most other Slavic languages.

Nouns, pronouns and adjectives can have three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural), and three cases:
* the &quot;direct case&quot;: used for both the subject and the direct object of a sentence. In the sentence: Miej poterz&quot; leże &quot;libier &quot;My father reads a book&quot;, &quot;Miej poterz&quot; &quot;my father&quot; and &quot;libier&quot; &quot;a book&quot; are both in the direct case.
* the &quot;genitive case&quot;: used to indicate possession, for example: siedź &quot;potrze &quot;&quot;my father&#x27;s&quot; chair&quot;, rzejna &quot;Anglie &quot;the queen &quot;of England&quot;&quot;.
* the &quot;dative case&quot;: used to indicate the indirect object of a sentence, for example: Da &quot;mi&quot; ił libier &quot;Give &quot;me&quot; that book&quot;, Da &quot;mi&quot; łu &quot;Give it &quot;to me&quot;&quot;.
Venedic also has a &quot;vocative case&quot;. In most cases it has the same form as the direct case, but there are exceptions: O potrze! &quot;Oh father!&quot; In earlier version of Venedic, it used to have nominative and accusative cases, but later merged to form the direct case.

Nouns can be subdivided into four declensions. They are similar to the declension system in Latin:
* The &quot;first declension&quot; are all words on -a, the vast majority of which are feminine;
* the &quot;second declension&quot; are mostly masculine and neuter words ending with a consonant. It is a mixture of the second and fourth declension in Latin;
* the &quot;third declension&quot; are mostly feminine words ending with a soft consonant;
* the &quot;fourth declension&quot; are words on -ej, it matches the Latin fifth declension. However, the author treated the nouns with the 4th declension ending as irregular, see also the sections below.

=== Declension endings ===

&quot;Hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; in this context are suffixes that are decided by final consonants, either hard (remaining consonants, like &quot;-n&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, or &quot;-d&quot;) or soft (postalveolars or palatal-like sounds, like &quot;-l&quot;, &quot;-ń&quot;, or &quot;-rz&quot;). Endings in &quot;-ia-&quot;, &quot;-ie-&quot;, and &quot;-i-&quot; are always affected by regular changes below:


=== Irregular nouns ===
There is a number of irregular nouns. Not just completely irregular nouns on the table below, some nouns have less predictable oblique stems (the rest stem other than nominative singular), as in above &quot;moszkieł&quot;, gen. &quot;moszklu&quot;. However, nouns with the last vowel &quot;ó&quot; regularly shorten to &quot;o&quot; (&quot;sórz&quot;, &quot;sorze&quot;).


=== Adjectives ===
Adjectives always agree in gender, number and case with the noun they modify. They can be placed both before and after it. Unlike nouns, the adjective declension are always consistent and there is no distinctions in declension classes.

==== Further derivatives of adjectives ====
The comparatives and superlatives are formed by the suffixes &quot;-ierzy&quot; and &quot;-ieśmy&quot;, respectively, to the adjective&#x27;s stem. However, the adjectives below have irregular comparative (second row) and superlative (third row) forms:
* &quot;bony&quot; &quot;good&quot;, &quot;mielerzy&quot;, &quot;oćmy&quot;
* &quot;mały&quot; &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;piejerzy&quot;, &quot;pieśmy&quot;
* &quot;grędzy&quot; &quot;big&quot;, &quot;mojerzy&quot;, &quot;mośmy&quot;
* &quot;łonięcy&quot; &quot;far&quot;, &quot;łonierzy&quot;, &quot;łonieśmy&quot;
* &quot;pieskły&quot; &quot;small&quot;, &quot;mnierzy&quot;, &quot;mnieśmy&quot;
* &quot;wiekły&quot; &quot;old&quot;, &quot;wieszczerzy&quot;, &quot;wieszcześmy&quot;
* &quot;jałty&quot; &quot;high&quot;, &quot;sprzerzy&quot;, &quot;sprześmy&quot;
* &quot;mołt&quot; &quot;many/much&quot;, &quot;pły&quot; &quot;more&quot;, &quot;płerześmy&quot; &quot;most&quot;

Adverbial forms are either done by removing the &quot;-y&quot;/&quot;-i&quot; from the root or adding the suffix &quot;-mięć&quot; into the root (&quot;kłary&quot;, &quot;kłar&quot;/&quot;kłaramięć&quot; &quot;warmly&quot;). There are no rules which forms are preferred, but the latter usually expresses how something is done.

For the longer form, &quot;-amięć&quot; is used after hard consonants while &quot;-iemięć&quot; used after soft consonants. Adjectives in &quot;-ły&quot; use the suffix &quot;-lemięć&quot; (i.e. &quot;-ł-&quot; + &quot;-iemięć&quot;), except for the adjectives &quot;biały&quot;, &quot;mały&quot;, &quot;miły&quot;, &quot;siegły&quot; which are always suffixed with the former (&quot;biały&quot; → &quot;białamieć&quot;). The adjective &quot;bony&quot; &quot;good&quot; has an irregular adverbial derivation: &quot;bień&quot;. The comparatives and superlatives can also have adverbial forms, by substituting &quot;-ierzy&quot; and &quot;-ieśmy&quot; with &quot;-iu&quot; and &quot;-ieśmie&quot;. Verbal participles always remove their last vowels.

The predicative forms are the same as masculine and neuter direct singular forms, except that sometimes the suffix &quot;-y&quot;/&quot;-i&quot; is removed, but this predicative forming is somewhat archaic and the resulting forms should not be confused with adverbs.

=== Pronouns ===
Unlike nouns, adjectives and other pronouns, personal pronouns do not use the direct case, but preserve the distinction between the nominative and accusative instead. They are displayed in the following chart:

== Verbs ==
Verbs are inflected for person, number, mood and tense. Because Latin and Proto-Slavonic had virtually identical person/number inflections, Venedic and Polish do also.

Venedic verbs have the following moods and tenses:
:&quot;infinitive&quot; – jemar &quot;to love&quot;
:&quot;present tense&quot; – jemu &quot;I love, I am loving&quot;
:&quot;imperfect&quot; – jemawa &quot;I loved&quot;
:&quot;perfect&quot; – jemie &quot; I have loved&quot;
:&quot;future tense (imperfective)&quot; – joru jemar &quot;I will love, I will be loving&quot;
:&quot;future tense (perfective)&quot; – jemaru &quot;I will have loved&quot;
:&quot;conditional mood&quot; – jemarsi &quot;I would love, I would have loved&quot;
:&quot;imperative mood&quot; – jem &quot;love!&quot;
:&quot;present active participle&quot; – jemęć &quot;loving&quot;
:&quot;perfect passive participle&quot; – jematy &quot;beloved&quot;

=== Regular verbs ===
== Word list ==
Venedic vocabulary as published on the internet consists of over 4000 words. Because of how it was developed from Vulgar Latin, Venedic words are closest to Italian, but with phonologic differences from Italian which may be compared to those distinguishing Portuguese from Spanish. The following charts of 30 shows what Venedic looks like in comparison to a number of other Romance languages; note that unlike Brithenig, where one-quarter of the words resembled Welsh words, only four Venedic words (not counting &quot;szkoła&quot;, borrowed into Polish from Latin) resemble Polish words, due to the Slavic languages&#x27; greater distance from the Romance languages compared to the Celtic languages:

== Sample text ==

The &quot;Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; in Venedic:

&quot;Potrze nostry, kwały jesz en czałór, sąciewkaty si twej numię.&quot;
&quot;Owień twej rzeń.&quot;
&quot;Foca si twa włątać, komód en czału szyk i sur cierze.&quot;
&quot;Da nów odzej nostry pań kocidzany.&quot;
&quot;I dziemieć nów nostrze dziewta, komód i nu dziemiećmy swór dziewtorzór.&quot;
&quot;I nie endycz nosz en ciętaceń, uta liwra nosz dzie mału.&quot;
&quot;Nąk twie są rzeń i pociestać i głurza, o siąprz. Amen.&quot;

Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in Venedic:
:&quot;Tuci ludzie noszczę sie liwrzy i jekwali z rześpiece świej dzińtacie i swór drzecór. Li są dotaci ku rocenie i koszczęce i dziewię ocar piara wyniałtru en jenie frotrzeńtacie.&quot;

Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in English:
:&quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

==Similar languages==
In the Ill Bethisad universe, there are two other languages which are related to Venedic: Slevan, which is spoken in that universe&#x27;s counterpart of Slovakia; and Šležan, or Silesian, spoken in Silesia. Šležan mirrors Czech in much the same way Venedic does Polish, whereas Slevan, despite being located in Slovakia, is more similar to Hungarian and Croatian in its orthography. (The Romance &quot;mirror&quot; of Slovak is a dialect of Slevan spoken in Moravia called Moravľaňec.) (As if in compensation, Croatian in Ill Bethisad is forced to be noticeably different from Serbian by being made to resemble the now-virtually-missing Czech and Slovak. )

Additionally, in the famous &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; series, the pseudo-Slavic fictional language Syldavian may be thought of as a Germanic counterpart of Venedic. The nearly extinct Wymysorys language provides another real-life example of this. Ill Bethisad also has such a &quot;Slavo-Germanic&quot; language: Bohemian, spoken in that universe&#x27;s Czech Republic, developed by amateur Czech linguist Jan Havliš.

<text>Actinolite ( ) is a compact rural community within geographic Elzevir Township in the Municipality of Tweed, Hastings County in Central Ontario, Canada. It is on Ontario Highway 37, just south of Ontario Highway 7 and north of the village of Tweed. The community also lies on the Skootamatta River just north of that river&#x27;s mouth at the Moira River.

==History==
When Actinolite was first founded in 1853, it was called Troy. A number of Billa Flint&#x27;s sawmills were built on the Skootamatta River here. In 1859, it became Bridgewater. In 1895, it was renamed Actinolite after a form of asbestos (actinolite) that was being extracted from open-pit mines near the town.

A branch line of the Bay of Quinte Railway (BQR) was built through Actinolite opening in 1903 that connected the BQR main line to the southeast to the Central Ontario Railway to the northwest. The line was abandoned in 1935. Ontario Highway 7 arrived in 1932.

<doc id="389999" wikidata="Q605945" url="?curid=389999" title="Canada Cup">
<text>The Canada Cup () was an invitational international ice hockey tournament held on five occasions between 1976 and 1991. The brainchild of Toronto lawyer Alan Eagleson, the tournament was created to meet demand for a true world championship that allowed the best players from participating nations to compete regardless of their status as professional or amateur. It was sanctioned by the International Ice Hockey Federation, Hockey Canada and the National Hockey League. Canada won the tournament four times, while the Soviet Union captured the championship once. It was succeeded by the World Cup of Hockey in 1996.

==History==
Due to National Hockey League (NHL) players&#x27; ineligibility in the Winter Olympics and the annual World Championships, both amateur competitions, Canada was not able to send its best players to top international tournaments. While the top players in Europe qualified as amateurs, all the best Canadian players competed in the professional NHL or World Hockey Association.

Following the 1972 and 1974 Summit Series, in which Canadian players from the NHL and WHA competed against the top players from the Soviet Union, there was interest in a world hockey championship where each country could send its best players. In a combined effort from Doug Fisher of Hockey Canada and Alan Eagleson of the NHL Players&#x27; Association, plans for such a tournament soon began.

After successful negotiations with hockey officials from the Soviet Union in September 1974, Eagleson began arranging the Canada Cup tournament, which debuted in 1976. Eagleson would later plead guilty to embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars of Canada Cup proceeds.

Taking place in the NHL off-season, it was the first international hockey tournament in which the best players, professional and amateur alike, from the best ice hockey nations in the world could compete against one another. Six teams competed in each edition. In addition to Canada and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United States were regular competitors (with the exception of West Germany replacing Finland in 1984). The tournaments, held every three to five years, took place in North American venues. Of the five Canada Cup tournaments, four were won by Canada, while the Soviet Union won once, in 1981.

Canada won the inaugural Canada Cup in 1976, defeating recent 1976 World Championship gold medalists Czechoslovakia in the best-of-three final. The clinching game was won by a 5–4 score with Darryl Sittler scoring the game-winner in overtime. Five years later, the Soviets won their first and only Canada Cup with an 8–1 win over Canada in the one-game final. The Canadians then re-captured the championship in the third edition of the tournament in 1984. After Canadian Mike Bossy scored an overtime game-winner to defeat the Soviets in the semi-finals, Canada won their second Canada Cup in a victory over Sweden in the final.

The 1987 Canada Cup was particularly noteworthy as Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux, widely considered two of the greatest hockey players of all-time, joined as linemates on Team Canada to capture the country&#x27;s third championship. All three games in the final between Canada and the Soviets ended in 6–5 scores, with two games going to overtime. Lemieux dramatically scored the championship-winning goal on a 2-on-1 pass from Gretzky in the final minutes of the deciding game at Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario.

The final Canada Cup was held in 1991 with Canada defeating the United States in the tournament&#x27;s first all-North American final, for their third straight championship and fourth overall. Five years later, the Canada Cup was replaced by the World Cup of Hockey in 1996.

==Trophy==
The Canada Cup trophy is shaped like half of a maple leaf and is made of solid nickel ( worth). It was refined by Inco Ltd in Sudbury Ontario, commissioned by D. Scott McCann (at the time President of Teledyne Canada). Donna Scott (Queen&#x27;s University, Bachelor of Fine Arts, 1985) designed the cup, citing as her inspiration Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; album cover.

===Controversy===
The 1981 win by the Soviet Union caused controversy when Canadian officials found the trophy in the Soviets&#x27; luggage and announced that the trophy would not actually go home with the winning team. Feeling this was unsportsmanlike, Canadian fans led by George Smith of Winnipeg, Manitoba raised money to produce a duplicate trophy to give to the Soviet team. $32,000 was raised. Three weeks later the trophy was presented to the Soviet Union&#x27;s ambassador Vladimir Mechulayev in Winnipeg. Most of the companies that made the trophy did the work for free and almost all of the money raised went to minor hockey in Winnipeg and Winkler, Manitoba.

<doc id="390000" wikidata="Q2310327" url="?curid=390000" title="Fast Product">
<text>Fast Product was an independent record label, established in Edinburgh by Bob Last, his partner, Hilary Morrison and Tim Pearce in December 1977. Its first release was also the first single by the Mekons, released on 20 January 1978.

The label issued the first records by a number of early and influential post-punk bands from Northern England, including the original Human League, Gang of Four and the Mekons. Fast Product also released the first singles by the Scottish punk bands Scars and The Flowers. The label also released compilations of various new bands called &#x27;ear comics&#x27; or &quot;Earcom&quot;. Many of the label&#x27;s releases were also produced by Bob Last with Morrison producing photographs and visuals for the record sleeves.

Fast Product&#x27;s releases challenged pop music conventions (hence the label&#x27;s early monikers: &quot;difficult fun&quot; and &quot;mutant pop&quot;), and through its releases and marketing invoked a DIY punk spirit and generally socialist political outlook. Often packaging records with a caustic yet subtle sideswipe at consumerism (for example, the image of a wall of gold discs on the cover of the Mekons&#x27; second single), Fast Product attempted to show that all aspects of the record business, from musicianship to design to distribution, could be taken out of the hands of the major labels.

Lloyd Cole also name-checked Fast Product in his song Women&#x27;s Studies, from the 2013 album Standards.

Later, the pair also established the Pop Aural label, releasing singles by such acts as The Flowers, Boots For Dancing and The Fire Engines.

The label was profiled in depth in the 2015 documentary film Big Gold Dream.

The story of Fast Product was extensively covered in the 2022 book Hungry Beat written by Douglas MacIntyre and Grant McPhee with Neil Cooper, published by White Rabbit Books

Bob Last has joked that Factory Records is &quot;Fast 13&quot; - the label&#x27;s final release - saying &quot;I just never told them they had a catalogue number.&quot;

<text>Peter Ludwig Berger (17 March 1929 – 27 June 2017) was an Austrian-born American sociologist and Protestant theologian. Berger became known for his work in the sociology of knowledge, the sociology of religion, study of modernization, and contributions to sociological theory.

Berger is arguably best known for his book, co-authored with Thomas Luckmann, &quot;The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge&quot; (New York, 1966), which is considered one of the most influential texts in the sociology of knowledge and played a central role in the development of social constructionism. In 1998 the International Sociological Association named this book as the fifth most-influential book written in the field of sociology during the 20th century. In addition to this book, some of the other books that Berger has written include: &quot;Invitation to Sociology: A Humanistic Perspective&quot; (1963); &quot;A Rumor of Angels: Modern Society and the Rediscovery of the Supernatural&quot; (1969); and &quot;The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion&quot; (1967).

Berger spent most of his career teaching at The New School for Social Research, at Rutgers University, and at Boston University. Before retiring, Berger had been at Boston University since 1981 and was the director of the Institute for the Study of Economic Culture.

==Biography==

===Family life===

Peter Ludwig Berger was born on March 17, 1929, in Vienna, Austria, to George William and Jelka (Loew) Berger, who were Jewish converts to Christianity. He emigrated to the United States shortly after World War II in 1946 at the age of 17 and in 1952 he became a naturalized citizen. He died on June 27, 2017, in his Brookline, Massachusetts, home after a prolonged illness.

On September 28, 1959, he married Brigitte Kellner, herself an eminent sociologist who was on the faculty at Wellesley College and Boston University where she was the chair of the sociology department at both schools. Brigitte was born in Eastern Germany in 1928. She moved to the United States in the mid-1950s. She was a sociologist who focused on the sociology of the family, arguing that the nuclear family was one of the main causes of modernization. Although she studied traditional families, she supported same-sex relationships. She was on the faculties of Hunter College of the City University of New York, Long Island University, Wellesley College, and Boston University. Additionally, she was author of &quot;Societies in Change&quot; (1971), &quot;The Homeless Mind&quot; (1974), &quot;The War over the Family&quot; (1984), and &quot;The Family in the Modern Age&quot; (2002). Brigitte Kellner Berger died May 28, 2015.

They had two sons, Thomas Ulrich Berger and Michael George Berger. Thomas is himself a scholar of international relations, now a professor at the Pardee School of Global Studies at Boston University and author of &quot;War, Guilt and World Politics After World War II&quot; (2012) and &quot;Cultures of Antimilitarism: National Security in Germany and Japan&quot; (2003).

===Education and career===
After the Nazi takeover of Austria in 1938, Berger and his family emigrated to Palestine, then under British rule. He attended a British high school, St. Luke&#x27;s. Following the German bombings of Haifa, he was evacuated to Mount Carmel, where he developed his life-long interest in religion. In 1947 Berger and his family emigrated again, this time to the United States, where they settled in New York City. Berger attended Wagner College for his Bachelor of Arts and received his MA and PhD from the New School for Social Research in New York in 1954. Berger, in his memoir, described himself as an &quot;accidental sociologist&quot;, enrolling here in an effort to learn about American society and help become a Lutheran minister, and learning under Alfred Schütz. In 1955 and 1956 he worked at the Evangelische Akademie in Bad Boll, West Germany. From 1956 to 1958 Berger was an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; from 1958 to 1963 he was an associate professor at Hartford Theological Seminary. The next stations in his career were professorships at the New School for Social Research, Rutgers University, and Boston College. Starting in 1981, Berger was the University Professor of Sociology and Theology at Boston University. He retired from BU in 2009. In 1985 he founded the Institute for the Study of Economic Culture, which later transformed into the Institute on Culture, Religion and World Affairs (CURA), and is now part of the Boston University Pardee School of Global Studies. He remained the Director of CURA from 1985 to 2010.

The original Peter L. Berger Papers are deposited in the Social Science Archive Konstanz.

==CURA==
Berger founded the Institute on Culture, Religion, and World Affairs at Boston University in 1985. It is a world-center for research, education, and public scholarship on religion and world affairs. Some of the questions it attempts to answer are: How do religion and values affect political, economic, and public ethical developments around the world? Defying earlier forecasts, why have religious actors and ideas become more rather than less globally powerful in recent years? and In a world of increasing religious and ethical diversity, what are the implications of the revival of public religion for citizenship, democracy, and civil coexistence? CURA has over 140 projects in 40 countries.

==Religious views==
Berger was a moderate Christian Lutheran conservative whose work in theology, secularization, and modernity at times has challenged the views of contemporary mainstream sociology, which tends to lean away from any right-wing political thinking. Ultimately, however, Berger&#x27;s approach to sociology was humanist with special emphasis on &quot;value-free&quot; analysis.

==Sociological thought==

===The social construction of reality===
As explained in Berger&#x27;s and Thomas Luckmann&#x27;s book &quot;The Social Construction of Reality&quot; (1966), human beings construct a shared social reality. This reality includes things ranging from ordinary language to large-scale institutions. Our lives are governed by the knowledge about the world that we have and we use the information that is relevant to our lives. We take into account typificatory schemes, which are general assumptions about society.
As one encounters a new scheme, one must compare it to the ones that are already established in one&#x27;s mind and determine whether to keep those schemes or replace the old ones with new ones. Social structure is the total of all these typificatory schemes. While Alfred Schutz (1899–1959) did not elaborate a sociology of knowledge, Berger and Luckmann acknowledge the centrality of Schutz
for their understanding of what theoretical ingredients ought to be added.

====The reality of everyday life====

Berger and Luckmann present &quot;the reality of everyday life&quot; as the sphere of reality that impinges upon human existence most intensely and immediately. Everyday life contrasts with other spheres of reality – dreamworlds, theatre – and is considered by a person to be objective, intersubjective (shared with others) and self-evident. Life is ordered spatially and temporally.
Spatial ordering allows interaction with other people and objects; the human ability to manipulate zones of space can intersect with another&#x27;s ability.

Social interactions in everyday life favour personal, face-to-face encounters as the best scenarios where human beings can actually connect with each other through interactions. Humans perceive the other in these interactions as more real than they would themselves; we can place a person in everyday life by seeing them, yet we need to contemplate our own placement in the world, as it is not so concrete. Berger believes that although you know yourself on a much deeper scale than you would the other person, they are more real to you because they are constantly making &quot;What he is&quot; available to you. It is difficult to recognize &quot;What I am&quot; without separating oneself from the conversation and reflecting on it. Even then, that self-reflection is caused by the other person&#x27;s interactions leading to that self contemplation.

Language is imperative to the understanding of everyday life. People understand knowledge through language. The knowledge relevant to us is the only necessary knowledge to our survival, but humans interact through sharing and connecting the relevant structures of our lives with each other. Language helps create shared symbols and stocks of knowledge, and participation in these things inherently makes us participate in society.

====Social reality on two levels====

Social reality exists at both the subjective and objective levels. At the subjective level, people find reality personally meaningful and created by human beings in aspects such as personal friendships. At the objective level, people find reality in aspects such as government bureaucracies and large corporations, where reality is seen as more out of one&#x27;s control.

==== Society as objective and subjective ====

Objectively, social order is a product of our social enterprise: it is an ongoing process that results from human activity. Institutions are a product of the historicity and need to control human habitualization (the repeated behaviours or patterns). The shared nature of these experiences and their commonality results in sedimentation, meaning they lose their memorability. Many behaviours lose sedimented institutional meanings. Institutional order involves specified roles for people to play. These roles are seen as performing as this objective figure – an employee is not judged as a human but by that role they have taken.

The process of building a socially-constructed reality takes place in three phases:

* Externalization is the first step in which humans pour out meaning (both mental and physical) into their reality, thus creating things through language. In externalization, social actors create their social worlds and it is seen through action.
* Following that, reality becomes established by the products of externalization through the course of objectivation (things and ideas &quot;harden&quot; in a sense). People see either a social practice or institution as an objective reality that cannot be changed, such as something like language.
* Lastly, this newly made and man-made reality (or society) has an effect on humans themselves. In this third phase, internalization, the external, objective world to a person becomes part of their internal, subjective world. As social actors we internalize norms and values, accepting them as givens, and make them our reality.
====Levels of socialization====

Subjectively, we experience first and second socializations into society. Firstly, family members and friends socialize one into the world during one&#x27;s childhood. Secondly, during one&#x27;s adulthood, one internalizes institutional &quot;sub worlds&quot; put in various positions in the economy. We maintain our subjective world through reaffirmation with social interactions with others. Our identity and our society are seen as dialectically related: our identity is formed by social processes, which are in turn ordered by our society. Berger and Luckmann see socialization as very powerful and able to influence things such as sexual and nutritional choices. People have the ability to do whatever they want in these spheres, but socialization causes people to only choose certain sexual partners or certain foods to eat to satisfy biological needs.

===Humanistic perspective===

The humanistic perspective is generally outside of mainstream, contemporary sociology. It is considered as a view that relates more to the humanities – literature, philosophy – than to social science. Its ultimate purpose lies in freeing society of illusions to help make it more humane. In this sense, we are the &quot;puppets of society&quot;, but sociology allows us to see the strings that we are attached to, which helps to free ourselves. Berger&#x27;s &quot;Invitation to Sociology&quot; outlines his approach to the field of sociology in these humanistic terms. Methodologically, sociologists should attempt to understand and observe human behaviour outside the context of its social setting and free from whatever influence a sociologist&#x27;s personal biases or feelings might be. The study of sociology, Berger posits, should be value-free. Research should be accrued in the same manner as the scientific method, using observation, hypothesis, testing, data, analysis and generalization. The meaning derived from the results of research should be contextualized with historical, cultural, environmental, or other important data.

===View of sociology===
Berger saw the field of sociology as not only just a way to help people and the community, but sociological insights are also important to all people interested in instilling action in society. Sociologists are a part of a multitude of fields, not just social work. Berger stated that sociology is not a practice, but an attempt to understand the social world. These understandings could be used by people in any field for whatever purpose and with whatever moral implications. He believed that sociologists, even if their values varied greatly, should at the very least have scientific integrity. Sociologists are only humans and will still have to deal with things such as convictions, emotions, and prejudices, but being trained in sociology should learn to understand and control these things and try to eliminate them from their work. A sociologist&#x27;s job is to accurately report on a certain social terrain. Sociology is a science, and its findings are found through observation of certain rules of evidence that allow people to repeat and continue to develop the findings.

== Religion and society ==

===Religion and the human problems of modernity===

Berger believed that society is made aware of what he referred to as the nomos, or the patterns a particular society wants its members to see as objectively right and to internalize. The nomos is all the society&#x27;s knowledge about how things are, and all of its values and ways of living. This is upheld through legitimacy, either giving special meaning to these behaviors or by creating a structure of knowledge that enhances the plausibility of the nomos. The existence of an eternal cosmic entity that legitimizes a nomos makes the nomos itself eternal; an individual&#x27;s actions within its set society are all based on a universal and orderly pattern based on their beliefs.

Modern pluralization, which has stemmed from the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, set forth a new set of values, including: separation of the religious and secular spheres of life, a person&#x27;s wealth as a determinant of value, maximizing freedom to enhance wealth, increasing prediction and control to increase wealth, and identifying oneself as a member of a nation-state. This, in turn, spread capitalism and its ideals and beliefs of individualism and rationalization and separated Christians from their God. With globalization, even more beliefs and cultures were confronted with this.

Berger believed that modernity – technological production paradigms of thinking and bureaucracy, namely – alienated the individual from primary institutions and forced individuals to create separate spheres of public and private life. There is no plausibility structure for any system of beliefs in the modern world; people are made to choose their own with no anchors to our own perceptions of reality. This lowers feelings of belonging and forces our own subjectivities onto themselves. Berger called this a &quot;homelessness of the mind.&quot; It is the product of the modern world, he believed, as it has transformed the technology of production into our consciousness, making our cognition componential, always searching for a &quot;means to an end.&quot; Ideas and beliefs are varied in the modern world, and an individual, not sharing their system of beliefs with the public whole, relegates any behaviors that are contingent on it to their private life. Certain beliefs that an individual has that may not be widely accepted by society as a whole, are then kept to one&#x27;s self and may only be seen within one&#x27;s private life and are not seen by society.

The socialist myth, a non-pejorative term of Berger&#x27;s, actually arises from intellectual leftism masking a need to resolve the lacking sense of community in the modern world through the promise to destroy the oppression of capitalism. Berger believed resolving community in modern society needs to emphasize the role of &quot;mediating structures&quot; in their lives to counter the alienation of modernity. Human existence in the age of modernity requires there to be structures like church, neighbourhood, and family to help establish a sense of belonging rooted in a commitment to values or beliefs. This builds a sense of community and belonging in an individual. In addition, these structures can serve a role in addressing larger social problems without the alienation that larger society creates. The role of mediating structures in civil society is both private and public, in this sense.

=== Pluralism ===
The general meaning of pluralism is the coexistence, generally peaceful, of different religions, worldviews, and value systems within the same society. Berger believes pluralism exists in two ways. The first being that many religions and worldviews coexist in the same society. The second is the coexistence of the secular discourse with all these religious discourses. Some people avoid pluralism by only operating within their own secular or religious discourse, meaning they do not interact with others outside of their beliefs.

A feature of pluralism generally today is that it is globalized. Berger sees benefits in pluralism. One is that very rarely is there complete consensus in beliefs; this allows people to form and hold their own differing beliefs: society is such that people do not all try to hold and conform to the same beliefs. This ties into a second benefit: that pluralism gives freedom and allows people free decisions.

A third benefit is that - if pluralism is connected to religious freedom - then religious institutions now become voluntary associations. Lastly, pluralism influences individual believers and religious communities to define the core of their faith separately from its less central elements. This allows people to pick and choose between certain aspects of their chosen form of belief - that they may or may not agree with - while still remaining true to the central parts of it.

=== Transcendence ===

In daily life, people experience symbols and glimpses of existence beyond empirical order and of transcendent existence. Berger calls these &quot;rumours of angels&quot;. People feel in times of great joy, in never-ending pursuit of order against chaos, in the existence of objective evil, and in the sense of hope that there exists some supernatural reality beyond that of human existence. People who choose to believe in the existence of a supernatural other require faith – a wager of belief against doubt – in the modern rationalised world. Knowledge can no longer sufficiently ground human belief in the pluralized world, forcing people to wager their own beliefs against the current of doubt in our society.

=== Secularization theory ===

Like most other sociologists of religion of his day, Berger once predicted the all-encompassing secularization of the world. He has admitted to his own miscalculations about secularization, concluding that the existence of resurgent religiosity in the modernised world has proven otherwise. In &quot;The Desecularization of the World&quot;, he cites both Western academia and Western Europe itself as exceptions to the triumphant desecularization hypothesis: that these cultures have remained highly secularized despite the resurgence of religion in the rest of the world. Berger finds that his and most sociologists&#x27; misconsensus about secularization may have been the result of their own bias as members of academia, which is a largely atheist concentration of people.

==Theoretical contributions==

In &quot;Making Sense of Modern Times: Peter L. Berger and the Vision of Interpretive Sociology&quot;, James Davison Hunter and Stephen C. Ainlay build upon the social theories of Berger&#x27;s. Hunter and Ainlay use Berger&#x27;s ideologies as a foundation and framework for this particular book. Nicholas Abercrombie begins by examining his reformation of the sociology of knowledge. Shifting his focus on the subjective reality of everyday life, Berger enters a dialogue with traditional sociologies of knowledge – more specific, those of Karl Marx and Karl Mannheim. Abercrombie digs deeper into this dialogue Berger brings up, and he considers ways in which Berger goes beyond these figures. Stephen Ainlay then pursues the notable influence on Berger&#x27;s work.

In the field of sociology, Berger has been somewhat excluded from the mainstream; his humanistic perspective was denounced by much of the intellectual elite in the field, though it sold well over a million copies. Berger&#x27;s leftist criticisms do not help him much in that regard either. Berger&#x27;s theories on religion have held considerable weight in contemporary neoconservative and theological fields of thinking, however.

In 1987 Berger argued about the emergence of a new social class he called the &quot;knowledge class&quot;. He views it as a result of what was known as the middle class into two groups: the &quot;old middle class&quot; of those who produce material goods and services and the &quot;knowledge class&quot; whose occupations relate to the production and distribution of &quot;symbolic knowledge.&quot; He followed Helmut Schelsky&#x27;s definition of &quot;Sinn- und Hellsvermittler&quot;, &quot;agents (intemediaries) of meanings and purposes&quot;.

==Influences==
Berger&#x27;s work was notably influenced by Max Weber. Weber focused on the empirical realities of rationality as a characteristic of action and rationalization. In comparison, Berger proposed the usage of the word &#x27;options&#x27; rather than freedom as an empirical concept. Therefore, much of the empirical work of Berger and Weber have revolved around the relationship between modern rationalization and options for social action. Weber argued that rationalism can mean a variety of things at the subjective level of consciousness and at the objective level of social institutions. The connection between Berger&#x27;s analysis of the sociology of religion in modern society and Max Weber&#x27;s &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; aligns. Weber saw capitalism as a result of the Protestant secularization of work ethic and morality in amassing wealth, which Berger integrates into his analysis about the effects of losing the non-secular foundations for belief about life&#x27;s ultimate meaning.

Berger&#x27;s own experiences teaching in North Carolina in the 1950s showed the shocking American prejudice of that era&#x27;s Southern culture and influenced his humanistic perspective as a way to reveal the ideological forces from which it stemmed.

==Honors==
Berger was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1982.
He was doctor &quot;honoris causa&quot; of Loyola University, Wagner College, the College of the Holy Cross, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Geneva, and the University of Munich, and an honorary member of many scientific associations.

In 2010, he was awarded the Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize by the University of Tübingen.

<text>Thomas Luckmann (; October 14, 1927 – May 10, 2016) was an American-Austrian sociologist of German and Slovene origin who taught mainly in Germany. Born in Jesenice, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Luckmann studied philosophy and linguistics at the University of Vienna and the University of Innsbruck. He married Benita Petkevic in 1950. His contributions were central to studies in sociology of communication, sociology of knowledge, sociology of religion, and the philosophy of science. His best-known titles are the 1966 book, &quot;The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge&quot; (co-authored with Peter L. Berger), &quot;The Invisible Religion&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Structures of the Life-World&quot; (1973) (co-authored with Alfred Schütz)

== Overview ==

=== Early life ===
Luckmann was born in 1927 in Jesenice, Slovenia which at the time was part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He had an Austrian father who was an industrialist, his mother was from a Slovene family from Ljubljana. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was the cousin of the Slovene poet Božo Vodušek. As a child he was exposed to two vastly different cultures, and Luckmann had the advantage of growing up in a bilingual environment speaking both Slovene and German. He attended Slovene-language schools while in Jesenice until the year 1941, when the occupation of Slovenia during World War II forced him to transfer to Klagenfurt high school in Austria. Later in 1943 he and his mother relocated to Vienna, after the death of his father and several other relatives during World War II. Living in Austria during this period automatically granted him German citizenship, and in 1944 he was drafted into the German army, joining the Luftwaffe where he served as a Luftwaffenhelfer. Luckmann was transferred to a military hospital for minor injuries shortly before the end of the war. Luckmann was in the hospital in Bavaria when the United States liberated the region. After liberation in 1945 Luckmann became a prisoner of war where he remained until the end of the war. He then settled back to Vienna and he could finish his high school exit exams, the &quot;Matura.&quot;

=== Educational background ===
Luckmann attended high school in Klagenfurt, Austria, after he and his family fled Italian occupation in Ljubljana in 1941. After the end of the war, Luckmann could return to school in Klagenfurt and pass his exit exams, the &quot;Matura.&quot; Luckmann began studying philosophy and linguistics at the University of Vienna in 1947 and continued in Innsbruck in 1948, studying different subjects in the social science field. He moved to the United States in 1950 with his wife, Benita Petkevic, where he then studied at The New School in New York City. 

At The New School, Luckmann began to discern his career as a sociologist. He was taught by Alfred Schütz, Dorion Cairns, Albert Salomon, and Carl Meyer, they later became great influence on Luckmann. This was when he was first introduced to the sociological discipline, and then he got familiarized with Alfred Schütz&#x27;s work on sociological phenomenology. He went on to meet Peter Berger, where he would later go on to co-author &quot;The Social Construction of Reality&quot;, which later ended up becoming one of his most notable works. Together, he and his colleagues produced some of the most influential sociological works of the 20th century.

Luckmann never intended to become a sociologist. His initial academic interests resided in linguistics, history and philosophy. At The New School, Luckmann primarily studied philosophy and chose to study sociology as a second subject, influenced by the professors there. For example, Luckmann was introduced to the sociology of religion when his teacher at the time, Carl Meyer, asked him to do field work about churches in Germany after World War II. Captivated by his experience in Germany, Luckmann used his fieldwork to pursue a Ph.D. in sociology. He obtained his first academic position at Hobart College, in Geneva, New York, before returning to teach at The New School after the death of Alfred Schütz. Luckmann was eventually granted a professorship position at the University of Frankfurt in 1965. After publishing two books in 1963 and 1966, and several successful essays, Luckmann worked as a professor of Sociology at the University of Konstanz in Germany from 1970 to his retirement, and later professor emeritus. It is noted that his time in at Konstanz was marked as an intense period of interdisciplinary work, in which he wrote multiple essays concerning communication, linguistics, literature and history.

=== Life Events ===

In 1950, Luckmann married Benita Petkevic, who was a Latvian-born socialogist who taught in the United States and Germany. It was said that their marriage was a turning point for his life, among many other factors. The couple had three daughters Maja, Mara, and Metka. On May 10, 2016, Luckmann died of cancer at the age of 88 at his home in Austria.

=== Legacy ===
Luckmann&#x27;s ideas and theories have been influential within the field in sociology and has had a huge impact on the world and intellectual thought.

== Works ==
Early Work

Luckmann worked as a chauffeur and his wife, Benita, worked as a typist when they first moved to New York. During this time, he continued studying sociology and philosophy at the New School for Research. It was there where he first met some of the great influences of his life, including Peter L. Berger.

=== Concepts ===

==== Philosophy and Social Thought ====
Luckmann was a follower of the phenomenologically oriented school of sociology, established by the Austrian American scholar Alfred Schütz. He contributed to the foundation of phenomenological sociology, the sociology of religion in modern societies, and the sociology of knowledge and communication. The interdisciplinary nature of his work remains relevant in sociology and other disciplines today.

==== Social Constructionism ====
Social Constructionism focuses on the study of the process of social construction. It could be described as an &quot;approach&quot; that is neither a theory of religion or any other social phenomenon. In several of his works, he developed the theory of social constructionism, which argues that all knowledge, including the most basic common-sense knowledge of everyday reality, which included gender, ethnicity, nations, and religion. It&#x27;s derived from and maintained by social interactions especially through language. Together with Peter L. Berger, he wrote the book &quot;The Social Construction of Reality, and it was published by&quot; 1966. The book was an important part of the move in sociology as it established &quot;social construction&quot; as part of sociological vocabulary. It was also particularly with the sociology of religion, away from the view of religion and religious values as central to the social order, arguing that social order is socially constructed by individuals and/or groups of individuals. Since publication, the book has been translated into thirteen different languages and serves as a cornerstone in sociological literature. Berger wrote on their experience writing the book saying &quot;someone asked, Why did not The Social Construction of Reality immediately have a huge effect? The effect came much later, and my answer was that you cannot play chamber music at a rock concert. And compared to what was going on all around us in the social sciences, we were doing chamber music.&quot;

==== Sociology of Religion ====
Following his field work in Germany and the completion of his dissertation, Luckmann was asked to complete several reviews on the surrounding sociological literature concerning religion. Disappointed by the positivistic, unauthentic views of a Church-backed sociology of religion, Luckmann was compelled to write &quot;The Invisible Religion&quot; in 1963 under the German title &quot;Das Problem der Religion in der modernen Gesellschaft.&quot; The book was then translated into English in 1967. Luckmann proposes that there are four derivative types of religion. The first of those he calls &quot;a universal and nonspecific elementary social form which is an objective total worldview providing social meaning for a society&#x27;s existence.&quot; The second, &quot;the specific institutional social form of religion constituted by configurations of religious representations form- ing a sacred cosmos which is part of the worldview.&quot; The third, &quot;a universal nonspecific form of individual religiosity which is an internalized subjective system of relevance reflecting the objectivated universal and nonspecific elementary social form of religion.&quot; Lastly, &quot;a specific biographical form of religiosity in individual consciousness.&quot; Drawing from Durkheim, Luckmann developed a functional perspective in his theoretical objectives. Luckmann&#x27;s theory reiterate&#x27;s Durkheim&#x27;s notion that &quot;the original symbol system whereby man emerged from the animal world was religious.&quot; Rather than reverting to popular explanations of secularization, Luckmann explained the emergence of a new kind of religion in the 20th century: private religion He explains the diffusion of world views and institutional de-specialization of religion led to a privatization, rather than a retreat, from religion. Though Luckmann initially received harsh criticisms, &quot;The Invisible Religion&quot; became a pivotal move within the sociology of religion in the 20th century, especially in conjunction with &quot;The Social Construction of Reality&quot;.

==== Sociology of Knowledge and Communication ====
Luckmann&#x27;s contribution to the sociology of knowledge and communication is based on his careful analysis of the link between socio-cultural linguistic practices, and the construction of social reality. His sociology of knowledge provides a theoretical, framework that allows the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse. Based on his empirical research of conversational analysis, Luckmann explains his theory of “communicative genres” in which linguistic types, such as, gossip, proverbs, or jokes, all serve as forms of social knowledge, and act as tools for the formation of social structure. He offers a comprehensive view on society as symbolic order and ordering, including levels and actors&#x27; agencies, and the interplay between both. There&#x27;s an emphasis the role of language and the daily &quot;conversation machinery&quot; for the construction of the shared social reality. His ethnography of speaking, modeled a social interactional code that gave a dissimilar approach to sources of social constraint.

==== Social Action ====
Luckmann continued this analysis of social action, and in 1982 he continued the work of Alfred Schütz, drawing on Schütz&#x27;s notes and unfinished manuscripts to complete &quot;Structures of the Life-World&quot;, published (posthumously for Schütz) in 1982. Luckmann then built upon Schütz&#x27;s analysis and published, &quot;Theory of Social Action&quot; in 1992.

Together with Richard Grathoff and Walter M. Sprondel, Luckmann founded the Social Science Archive Konstanz (also known as the Alfred Schütz Memorial Archives). What became the official archive of the German Sociological Association, Luckmann and his colleagues gathered research accounts of German social science.

In 1998 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

In 2004 Luckmann became an honorary member of the Slovenian Sociological Association. The German Sociological Association awarded him a prize for his outstanding lifetime contribution to sociology at its 2002 Congress, and Luckmann became an honorary member in 2016.

The original Thomas Luckmann Papers are deposited in the Social Science Archive Konstanz.

<text>Martin-Baker Aircraft Company Limited is a British manufacturer of ejection seats and safety-related equipment for aviation. The company was originally an aircraft manufacturer before becoming a pioneer in the field of ejection seats. The company&#x27;s headquarters are in Higher Denham, Buckinghamshire, England, with other sites in France, Italy and the United States.

Martin-Baker supplies ejection seats for 93 air forces worldwide. Martin-Baker seats have been fitted into over 200 fixed-wing and rotary types with the most recent being the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II programme.

Martin-Baker claimed in 2022 that since the first live ejection test in 1945, a total of 7,777 lives have been saved by the company&#x27;s ejection seats.

Martin-Baker also manufactures what it calls &quot;crashworthy&quot; seats for helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. , over 20,000 crashworthy seats have been delivered. The Martin-Baker company continues as a family-run business, run by the twin sons of the late Sir James Martin since Autumn 1979.

==History==
The factory for building aircraft was established in 1929 by James Martin and &quot;Martin&#x27;s Aircraft Works&quot; was founded at Denham by James Martin and Captain Valentine Baker with financial help from Francis Francis. The company was building a prototype aircraft, the MB 1, using the design patents for aircraft structures held by Martin. On 17 August 1934, the Martin-Baker Aircraft Company was formed to continue the work of aircraft development.

Martin and Baker designed an unconventional, two-seat, low-wing monoplane design in the early 1930s as the MB 1. This was powered by a de Havilland Gipsy engine mounted in the fuselage behind the seats and driving a fixed pitch propeller through a shaft running horizontally between the pilot and passenger. The project was abandoned due to financial constraints, although the fuselage and engine installation had been completed. Martin-Baker also constructed an autogyro designed by Raoul Hafner. This, their first complete aircraft project, was later tested by Captain Baker at Heston Aerodrome.

In 1935, Martin and Baker designed and flew their Martin-Baker MB 1, a two-seat light touring aircraft. Their first military design was the Martin-Baker MB 2, a Napier Dagger–powered fighter that flew in 1938. It was a private venture to meet Air Ministry Specification F.5/34 for a fighter for service in the tropics. The MB 2 was tested but neither it nor other designs to F.5/34 were adopted.
* Martin-Baker MB 3 (1942): a six-cannon fighter design, powered by a Napier Sabre. Baker was killed in a crash while testing the prototype.
* Martin-Baker MB 4 (1943): a Rolls-Royce Griffon-engined fighter, cancelled on the drawing board.

The Martin-Baker MB 5 which first flew in 1944 had started out as the second MB 3 prototype but was extensively redesigned with a tubular steel fuselage. It used the Griffon engine driving contra-rotating propellers.
* Martin-Baker MB 6 (1945): a Second World War jet fighter project with a swing-arm, 0/0 spring-loaded ejection seat.
* Martin-Baker MB 7 (1946) &quot;Black Bess&quot;: a postwar interceptor/high-speed test aircraft concept. Small flying models were made but the project was cancelled in 1947.

Martin-Baker manufactured aircraft components, including retrofit improvements to the ammunition belt feeds for the Hispano Mk II autocannon and armoured seats for Supermarine Spitfires, throughout the Second World War. James Martin also designed and manufactured explosive bolt cutters fitted to bomber wings to cut barrage balloon cables that were fitted to many aircraft and saved a number of aircraft.

In 1944, the company was approached by the Ministry of Aircraft Production to investigate ejection systems enabling pilots to bail out safely from high-speed fighter aircraft.

==Ejection seats==

Martin-Baker investigated ejection seats from 1934 onwards, several years before Germany and Sweden proposed similar systems in 1938. The company concluded that an explosive-powered ejection seat was the best solution. In particular, Baker&#x27;s death in 1942 during a test flight of the MB 3 affected Martin so much that pilot safety became his primary focus and led to the later reorganisation of the company to focus primarily on ejection seats.

In 1944, James Martin was asked by the Ministry of Aircraft Production to develop methods for fighter pilots to escape their aircraft. Martin decided that the best method involved ejection of the seat with the occupant sitting in it, aided by an explosive charge. After ejection, the pilot would separate from the seat and open his parachute by pulling a ripcord in the usual way.

At that time there was little information on how much upward thrust the human body could withstand. Data relating to &quot;g&quot; forces in catapult launching of aircraft involved horizontal thrust and was therefore inapplicable to the new problem. Tests would have to be conducted to find out how much upward &quot;g&quot; force a person could tolerate. These were done by shooting a seat up a near-vertical path, loading the seat to represent the weight of the occupant, and measuring the accelerations involved.

A test rig was built in the form of a tripod, one of the legs being in the form of guide rails. The seat was propelled up the guide rails by a gun, consisting of two telescopic tubes energised by an explosive cartridge. The guide rails were provided with ratchet stops every so that the seat was automatically arrested at the top of its travel.

Studies were conducted to find the limits of upward acceleration that the human body could stand. The first dummy shot with the seat loaded to was made on 20 January 1945, and four days later one of the company&#x27;s experimental fitters, Bernard Lynch, undertook the first &quot;live&quot; ride, being shot up the rig to a height of . In three further tests, the power of the cartridge was progressively increased until a height of 10 feet was reached, at which stage Lynch reported the onset of considerable physical discomfort. The first seat was successfully live-tested by Lynch on 24 July 1946, who ejected from a Gloster Meteor travelling at IAS at over Chalgrove Airfield in Oxfordshire.

The first production Martin-Baker ejection seat, a &#x27;Pre-Mk 1&#x27;, was installed in the Saunders-Roe SR.A/1 prototype.

The first use of an ejection seat in a practical application by a British pilot involved the Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52 flying wing experimental aircraft in May 1949.

Martin-Baker was a pioneer in expanding the operational envelope of the ejection seat to enable it to be used at low altitudes and airspeeds, leading eventually to development of the &quot;zero-zero&quot; capability in 1961.

==Operations==
The Martin-Baker company uses its own airfield, Chalgrove Airfield, in Oxfordshire for operational testing of ejection seats. In 2016, ejection tests were carried out at Cazaux Air Base; the company&#x27;s Meteor aircraft testbeds were flown from Chalgrove to France for them.

Two Gloster Meteor T.7 aircraft, &quot;WL419&quot; and &quot;WA638&quot;, remain in service with the company as flying testbeds. Another Meteor (&quot;WA634&quot;), used in early development of ejection seats, is retained at the RAF Museum at RAF Cosford.

==Ejection Tie Club==

Martin-Baker also sponsors an &quot;Ejection Tie Club&quot;, producing a tie, patch, certificate, tie pin and membership card for those whose lives have been saved by a Martin-Baker ejection seat. The company also partnered with Bremont to produce a limited-edition wristwatch for members of the club. The watch must be purchased privately, though Martin-Baker does subsidize its cost. , there are now over 6,000 registered members of the club since it was founded in 1957.

==Red Arrows pilot incident==
In 2011, Red Arrows pilot Flt. Lt. Sean Cunningham was ejected from his Hawk T1 jet on the ground at RAF Scampton. The parachute failed to deploy and Cunningham was killed. On 22 January 2018, company director John Martin entered a guilty plea to breaching Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 on behalf of Martin-Baker wherein he admitted that the company had been aware of a technical problem with the ejector seat since 1990, but failed to notify the RAF. The firm admitted the health and safety breach on the basis it had failed to provide a written warning to the RAF about over-tightening a bolt on the aircraft.

<text>Spyke (Evan Daniels) is a fictional character created by writer Robert N. Skir and artist Steven E. Gordon for the WB animated superhero series &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot;, which is based on American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Voiced by Neil Denis, the character is a high school student with the mutant ability to project spikes out of his body. Originally, Spyke was intended to be called Armadillo and have cornrows. He was created as a way to diversify the series&#x27; X-Men roster and include an African-American character among the main cast. Spyke has similar powers to Marrow, a pre-existing character, though Kirkland stated that this was not intentional.

==Character biography==
Spyke is Storm&#x27;s nephew, who was born and raised in New York City. After learning that he is a mutant, she recruits him into the X-Men despite his initial reluctance.

In the third-season episode &quot;X-Treme Measures&quot;, Spyke loses control of his powers and becomes unable to retract his spikes after drinking Pow-R8, an energy drink that is harmful to mutants. As such, he joins the Morlocks, a group of mutants with similar unhideable mutations.

When Spyke returns in the fourth-season episode &quot;Uprising&quot;, he has permanently manifested a spiky exoskeleton across his upper body and gained the ability to ignite his spikes. He later works with the X-Men to destroy Apocalypse&#x27;s pyramids.

==Powers and abilities==
Spyke can extend or retract bone spikes that grow inside his body. He may shoot them out or bring them out to grab and hold. He also needs to drink milk to replace the calcium that he loses when using his powers. His body also seals the wounds caused by projecting his spikes with no visible scarring. He is also an expert skateboarder, and has integrated his skateboarding prowess into battles.

In later episodes, Spyke gains the ability to ignite the ends of his spikes and scale walls by sticking his spikes into them.

==Other versions==
David Munroe, a character loosely based on Spyke, appears in the Earth-616 continuity. He is Storm&#x27;s cousin, and named after her late father.

Another character named Darian Elliott, otherwise known as Spike, was introduced in &quot;X-Force&quot; #124. His appearance, name and powers were also loosely based on Spyke.

A clone of Spyke created by Mojo appears in &quot;X-Babies Stars Reborn&quot;.

<doc id="390032" wikidata="Q4200792" url="?curid=390032" title="Indian March of Paul">
<text>The Indian March of Paul () was a secret project of a planned allied Russo-French expedition against Britain&#x27;s East India Company rule in India. It was abandoned following the assassination of Emperor Paul I of Russia in March 1801.

Russia and Britain were allied during the French Revolutionary Wars of the 1790s. The simultaneous failure of their 1799 joint invasion of the Netherlands, as well as the 1799 Austro-Russian Italian and Swiss expedition which Britain partially financed, precipitated a change in attitudes. Britain&#x27;s occupation of Malta in October 1800 incensed Emperor Paul in his capacity of Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. He hastily broke with Britain and allied himself with Napoleon, who came up with an extravagant plan for a Russo-French expedition to attack the British possessions in India.

== Secret plans ==

The secret plan of the expedition, as preserved in the Russian archives, envisaged the joint operations of two infantry corps, one French (with artillery support) and one Russian. Each infantry corps had 35,000 men, the total force thus containing 70,000 men, plus artillery and a large contingent of Cossack cavalry.

Napoleon insisted that the command of the French corps be entrusted to General André Masséna. The route of advance schedule for the French corps started in May 1801 via the Danube and the Black Sea through southern Russia via Taganrog, Tsaritsyn, and Astrakhan.

At the Volga estuary, the French were supposed to be joined by Russian forces. Then the joint Russo-French corps was to cross the Caspian Sea and land at the Iranian port of Astrabad. The whole trip from France to Astrabad was calculated to take eighty days. Further advance would take another fifty days via Herat and Kandahar before reaching the main areas of India in September of the same year.

The Indian March was designed to look very much like Napoleon&#x27;s expedition to Egypt, with engineers, painters and scientists taking part. Also meticulously devised was the public relations side of the Indian expedition. For example, the instructions for trade with the local peoples included the recommendation to sell the cloths &quot;of the colorings most liked by the Asians&quot;. The expeditionary force was to have in stock a reserve of fireworks for festive illuminations.

== Outcome ==

In January 1801, the Don Cossack ataman Vasily Petrovich Orlov received orders for his cavalry force to march toward India. The schedule was for him to reach the steppe fort of Orenburg in a month, and from there to move via Bukhara and Khiva to the Indus River. Soon after receiving these orders, the 20,000-strong Cossack force started for the Kazakh steppes.

In his book about the Great Game, Peter Hopkirk narrates that Paul had not been able to obtain a detailed map of India until the Cossacks&#x27; departure from Orenburg. He quotes the Tsar as instructing Orlov: &quot;My maps only go as far as Khiva and the River Oxus. Beyond these points it is your affair to gain information about the possessions of the English, and the condition of the native population subject to their rule&quot;.

When Orlov&#x27;s modest Cossack contingent had advanced as far south as the Aral Sea, they received news of the emperor&#x27;s assassination. The Indian March was brought to a halt, and before long the Cossacks were commanded to retreat. It is conjectured, without evidence, that the Pahlen plot to assassinate the emperor was triggered by the Indian adventure, given that the high-placed Russian officials did not approve of it, and their conspiracy was financed by British diplomacy.

== Assessment ==

The British public learned about the incident years later, but it firmly imprinted on the popular consciousness, contributing to feelings of mutual suspicion and distrust associated with the Great Game. Hugh Seton-Watson observes that &quot;the grotesque plan had no military significance, but at least showed its author&#x27;s state of mind&quot;. This assessment is echoed by Hopkirk who remarks that &quot;no serious thought or study has been given to this wild adventure&quot;.

<text>The Royal Victorian Order () is a dynastic order of knighthood established in 1896 by Queen Victoria. It recognises distinguished personal service to the monarch, members of the royal family, or to any viceroy or senior representative of the monarch. The present monarch, King Charles III, is the sovereign of the order. The order&#x27;s motto is &quot;Victoria.&quot; The order&#x27;s official day is 20 June. The order&#x27;s chapel is the Savoy Chapel in London.

There is no limit on the number of individuals honoured at any grade. Admission is at the sole discretion of the monarch. Each of the order&#x27;s five grades represent different levels of service, as does the medal, which has three levels of service. While all those honoured may use the prescribed styles of the order – the top two grades grant titles of knighthood, and all grades accord distinct post-nominal letters – the Royal Victorian Order&#x27;s precedence amongst other honours differs from realm to realm and admission to some grades may be barred to citizens of those realms by government policy.

==History==

Prior to the close of the 19th century, most general honours within the British Empire were bestowed by the sovereign on the advice of her British ministers, who sometimes forwarded advice from ministers of the Crown in the Dominions and colonies (appointments to the then most senior orders of chivalry, the Order of the Garter and the Order of the Thistle, had been made on ministerial advice since the 18th century and were not restored to the personal gift of the sovereign until 1946 and 1947, respectively). Queen Victoria thus established on 21 April 1896 the Royal Victorian Order as a junior and personal order of knighthood that allowed her to bestow directly to an empire-wide community honours for personal services. The organisation was founded a year before Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee, so as to give the Queen time to complete a list of first inductees. The order&#x27;s official day was made 20 June of each year, marking the anniversary of Queen Victoria&#x27;s accession to the throne.

In 1902, King Edward VII created the Royal Victorian Chain &quot;as a personal decoration for royal personages and a few eminent British subjects&quot; and it was the highest class of the Royal Victorian Order. It is today distinct from the order, though it is officially issued by the chancery of the Royal Victorian Order.

The order was open to foreigners from its inception, with the Prefect of Alpes-Maritimes and the Mayor of Nice being the first foreigners to receive the honour in 1896.

==Composition==

The reigning monarch is at the apex of the Royal Victorian Order as its Sovereign, followed by the Grand Master; the latter position was created in 1937 and was occupied by Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) from that date until her death in 2002. Queen Elizabeth II then appointed her daughter, Anne, Princess Royal, to the position in 2007. Below the Grand Master are five officials of the organisation: the Chancellor, held by the Lord Chamberlain; the Secretary, held by the Keeper of the Privy Purse and Treasurer to the King; the Registrar, held by the Secretary to the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood; the Chaplain, held by the Chaplain of the King&#x27;s Chapel of the Savoy; and the Genealogist.

Thereafter follow those honoured with different grades of the order, divided into five levels: the highest two conferring accolades of knighthood and all having post-nominal letters and, lastly, the holders of the Royal Victorian Medal in gold, silver or bronze. Foreigners may be admitted as honorary members. There are no limits to the number of any grade, and promotion is possible. The styles of knighthood are not used by princes, princesses, or peers in the uppermost ranks of the society, save for when their names are written in their fullest forms for the most official occasions. Retiring Deans of the Royal Peculiars of St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle and Westminster Abbey are customarily inducted as Knights Commander; clergymen appointed to the higher levels of the Royal Victorian Order do not use the associated styles, however, and honorary members are not permitted to hold them at all.

Prior to 1984, the grades of Lieutenant and Member were classified as &quot;Members (fourth class)&quot; and &quot;Members (fifth class)&quot;, respectively, but both with the post-nominals &quot;MVO&quot;. On 31 December of that year, Queen Elizabeth II declared that those in the grade of Member (fourth class) would henceforth be Lieutenants with the post-nominals &quot;LVO&quot;.


==Insignia and vestments==

Upon admission into the Royal Victorian Order, members are given various insignia. Common for all members is the badge, which is a Maltese cross with a central medallion depicting on a red background the Royal Cypher of Queen Victoria surrounded by a blue ring bearing the motto of the order – &quot;victoria&quot; (victory) – and surmounted by a Tudor crown. However, there are variations on the badge for each grade of the order: Knights and Dames Grand Cross on certain formal occasions (see below) wear the badge suspended from the Order&#x27;s collar (chain), but otherwise on a sash passing from the right shoulder to the left hip; Knight Commanders and male Commanders wear the badge on a ribbon at the neck; male Lieutenants and Members wear the badge from a ribbon on the left chest; and women in all grades below Dame Grand Cross wear the badge on a bow pinned at the left shoulder. For Knights and Dames Grand Cross, Commanders, and Lieutenants, the Maltese cross is rendered in white enamel with gold edging, while that for Knights and Dames Commander (on the star) and Members (the badge itself) is in silver. Further, the size of the badge varies by rank, that for the higher classes being larger, and Knights and Dames Grand Cross and Knights and Dames Commander have their crosses surrounded by a star: for the former, an eight-pointed silver star, and for the latter, an eight-pointed silver Maltese cross with silver rays between each arm.

The medal bears the effigy and name of the reigning sovereign at the time of its awarding, as well as the phrase &quot;DEI • GRATIA • REX (or REGINA) • F.D.&quot; (by the grace of God, King (or Queen), Defender of the Faith), and on the reverse is the Royal Cypher upon an ornamental shield within a laurel wreath. Bars may be awarded to each class of medal for further services, and should recipients be awarded a higher level of medal or be appointed to a grade of the order itself, they may continue to wear their original medal along with the new insignia.

The order&#x27;s ribbon is blue with red-white-red stripe edging, the only difference being that for foreigners appointed into the society, their ribbon bears an additional central white stripe. For Knights Grand Cross, the ribbon is wide, for Dames Grand Cross , for Knights and Dames Commander , and for all other members .

At formal events, or &quot;collar days&quot;, of which there are 34 throughout the year, such as New Year&#x27;s Day and royal anniversaries, Knights and Dames Grand Cross wear the Royal Victorian Order&#x27;s livery collar, consisting of an alternating string of octagonal gold pieces depicting a gold rose on a blue field and gold oblong frames within which are one of four inscriptions: &quot;Victoria&quot;, &quot;Britt. Reg.&quot; (Queen of the Britons), &quot;Def. Fid.&quot; (, or Defender of the Faith), and &quot;Ind. Imp.&quot; (Empress of India). The chain supports a larger octagonal medallion with a blue enamel surface edged in red and charged with a saltire, over which is an effigy of Queen Victoria; members of the order suspend from this medallion their insignia as a &quot;badge apendant&quot;. Though after the death of a Knight or Dame Grand Cross their insignia may be retained by their family, the collar must be returned. Knights and Dames Grand Cross also wear a mantle of dark blue satin edged with red satin and lined with white satin, bearing a representation of the order&#x27;s star on the left side.

==Chapel==

Since 1938, the chapel of the Royal Victorian Order has been the King&#x27;s Chapel of the Savoy, in central London, England. However, the population of the order has grown to the point that the Savoy chapel can no longer accommodate the gathering of members held every four years, and St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle is now employed for the event.

The Sovereign and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the order are allotted stalls in the Savoy chapel&#x27;s choir, and on the back of each stall is affixed a brass plate displaying the occupant&#x27;s name, coat of arms, and date of admission into the organisation. Upon the occupant&#x27;s death, the plate is retained, leaving the stalls festooned with a record of the order&#x27;s Knights and Dames Grand Cross since 1938. The only heraldic banners normally on display in the chapel are those of the &quot;Sovereign of the Royal Victorian Order&quot; and of the &quot;Grand Master of the Royal Victorian Order&quot; as there is insufficient space in the chapel for more knights&#x27; and dames&#x27; banners or other heraldic devices.

The Chaplain of the King&#x27;s Chapel of the Savoy is ex officio the Chaplain to the Royal Victorian Order. The current incumbent is Canon Thomas Woodhouse.

== Eligibility and appointment ==

Membership in the Royal Victorian Order is conferred by the monarch without ministerial advice on those who have performed personal service for the sovereign.

Foreign members will generally be admitted as honorary members of the Royal Victorian Order when the sovereign is making a state visit to the individual&#x27;s country or a head of state is paying a state visit to the United Kingdom.

===Canadians===

As admission to the top two levels of the organisation provides for an honorary prefix, Canadians are not normally appointed to these levels as long as the monarch&#x27;s Canadian ministry adheres to the Nickle Resolution of 1919.

As it was deemed by the Canadian Cabinet to be an honour within the gift of the monarch, the appointment of Canadians to the order resumed in 1972 and eligibility was extended to those who render services to the monarch&#x27;s representatives in the country; officials within the provincial spheres being included after 1984. Originally, the sovereign chose inductees personally, though the Governor General of Canada and the Canadian Secretary to the King could provide suggestions, some passed to them by the lieutenant governors. The practice of notifying the Prime Minister of Canada of nominees ended in 1982, to distance the order as far from politics as possible.

It was reported in 2008 that some in the Chancellery of Honours at Rideau Hall wished to eliminate the Royal Victorian Order from the Canadian honours system and sometimes contested when a Canadian was appointed; however, no formal changes were ever planned. In Canada, the order has come to be colloquially dubbed as the &quot;Royal Visit Order&quot;, as the majority of appointments had been made by the then sovereign during her tours of the country.

The &quot;Royal Victorian Order Association of Canada&quot; exists for all Canadians appointed to the order or who have received the Royal Victorian Medal; it is the only such organisation in the Commonwealth realms. Founded by Michael Jackson, the group has, since 2008, gathered biennially.

==Precedence==

As the Royal Victorian Order is open to the citizens of fifteen countries, each with their own system of orders, decorations, and medals, the RVO&#x27;s place of precedence varies from country to country. Some are as follows:

In the United Kingdom, the wives of male members of all classes also feature on the order of precedence, as do sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commanders; relatives of Dames, however, are not assigned any special precedence. As a general rule, individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands, but not from their mothers or wives.

<text>Krystian Zimerman (born 5 December 1956) is a Polish concert pianist, conductor and pedagogue who has been described as one of the greatest pianists of his generation. In 1975, he won the IX International Chopin Piano Competition.

Following the success at the Chopin Piano Competition, he began his collaboration with the Berlin Philharmonic and has since performed with leading orchestras around the world as well as many prominent conductors such as Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Boulez, Herbert von Karajan, Claudio Abbado and Simon Rattle. He is especially known for his performances of compositions by Mozart, Chopin, Brahms and Beethoven. He is also the recipient of many awards and honours including Léonie Sonning Music Prize (1994), Legion of Honour (2005), Order of Polonia Restituta (2013) and Praemium Imperiale (2022).

==Biography==
Zimerman was born in Zabrze, Southern Poland, and started to play the piano at the age of five encouraged by his father, who was also a pianist. He studied at the Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music in Katowice under Andrzej Jasiński. In 1973, he won top prize at the Ludwig van Beethoven International Piano Competition in Hradec Králové, Czechoslovakia. His international career was launched when he won the 1975 Warsaw International Chopin Piano Competition. He performed with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1976, conducted by Herbert Blomstedt. Arthur Rubinstein invited him to Paris to work with him, which lead to a life-long friendship and mentorship. Zimerman debuted in the United States with the New York Philharmonic in 1979. He has toured widely and made a number of recordings. Since 1996, he has taught piano at the Music Academy in Basel, Switzerland. In 1999, Zimerman created the Polish Festival Orchestra to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s death.

Zimerman is best known for his interpretations of Romantic music, but has performed a wide variety of classical pieces and is a supporter of contemporary music. Witold Lutosławski wrote his Piano Concerto for Zimerman, who has recorded it twice. Among his best-known recordings are the concerti of Grieg and Schumann with Herbert von Karajan; the Brahms concerti with Leonard Bernstein; the piano concerti of Chopin, one recording conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini and a later one conducted by himself at the keyboard; the Third, Fourth and Fifth Piano Concertos of Beethoven under Bernstein (Zimerman himself led the Vienna Philharmonic from the keyboard in Beethoven&#x27;s First and Second Concertos); the first and second piano concerti of Rachmaninoff; the piano concerti of Liszt with Seiji Ozawa, the piano concerti of Ravel with Pierre Boulez, and solo piano works by Chopin, Liszt (including one of the most virtuosic performances of the famous Piano Sonata in B minor), Debussy and Schubert. In 2006, Zimerman recorded Brahms&#x27; Piano Concerto No. 1 with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Sir Simon Rattle (DG 477 5413; Limited Edition DG 477 6021).

Zimerman has collaborated with conductors and artists such as Claudio Abbado, Daniel Barenboim, Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Boulez, Charles Dutoit, Carlo Maria Giulini, Bernard Haitink, Herbert von Karajan, Kirill Kondrashin, Erich Leinsdorf, Lorin Maazel, Zubin Mehta, Riccardo Muti, Seiji Ozawa, Simon Rattle, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Stanisław Skrowaczewski and Wolfgang Sawallisch.

==Criticism of US policy==
On 26 April 2009, Zimerman vowed to his audience at Los Angeles&#x27;s Walt Disney Concert Hall that, in protest at America&#x27;s placement of a missile defense shield in Poland, this would be his final appearance in the United States. He had made a similar comment in 2006, stating he would not return until George W. Bush was out of office. he has not made any further appearances in the United States.
Part of his disenchantment with the USA may be the increased security at US airports, which makes it difficult to bring his piano into the country. In incidents in 2001 and 2006, one of his Steinway pianos was completely destroyed and another one damaged by security staff at New York JFK airport.

==Personal life==
In 1981, Zimerman moved to Röschenz in the canton of Basel-Landschaft, Switzerland, where he also became a Swiss citizen with Röschenz as his place of origin. According to conflicting sources, he&#x27;s still living in Röschenz, or in Binningen, also near Basel. He married Maria (&quot;née&quot; Drygajło), a violinist, with whom he has two children: Klaudia and Ryszard. He divides his time among family, concerts, and performances of chamber music. Zimerman is an editor of the piano music of Władysław Szpilman for Boosey &amp; Hawkes.

<text>Severo Bonini (23 December 1582 – 5 December 1663) was an Italian composer, organist, and writer on music.

He was born in Florence and became a Benedictine monk. He studied singing with Giulio Caccini. He served as organist in Forlì from 1613 and held a number of other posts before returning to Florence in 1640 where he was &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; and organist at Santa Trinita until his death. He died in Florence.

He published several books of music, including motets and madrigals. He wrote music in the new monodic style. His treatise &quot;Prima parte de&#x27; discorsi e regole sovra la musica&quot; (1649–1650) is an important source of information on contemporary composers and the rise of monody and opera.

<doc id="390045" wikidata="Q203729" url="?curid=390045" title="Battle of Kadesh">
<text>The Battle of Kadesh took place in the 13th century BC between the Egyptian Empire led by pharaoh Ramesses II and the Hittite Empire led by king Muwatalli II. Their armies engaged each other at the Orontes River, just upstream of Lake Homs and near the archaeological site of Kadesh, along what is today the Lebanon–Syria border.

The battle is generally dated to May 1274 BC, as accounted by Egyptian chronology, and is the earliest pitched battle in recorded history for which details of tactics and formations are known. It is believed to be the largest battle ever fought involving chariots, numbering at a total of 5,000 to 6,000.

After being outmaneuvered, ambushed, and surrounded, Ramesses II personally led a charge through the Hittite ranks with his bodyguard. They broke through and avoided the capture or death of the pharaoh.

The battle is considered to have ended in a stalemate.

==Background==
After expelling the Hyksos&#x27; 15th Dynasty around 1550 BC, the rulers of the New Kingdom of Egypt became more aggressive in reclaiming control of their state&#x27;s borders. Thutmose I, Thutmose III, and his son and coregent Amenhotep II fought battles from Megiddo north to the Orontes, including conflict with Kadesh.

Many Egyptian accounts between c. 1400 and 1300 BCE reflect the general destabilization of Djahy, a region in southern Canaan. During the reigns of Thutmose IV and Amenhotep III, Egypt continued to lose territory to the Mitanni in northern Syria.

During the late Eighteenth Dynasty, the Amarna letters tell the story of the decline of Egyptian influence in the region. The Egyptians showed little interest in this region until almost the end of the dynasty. Horemheb (d. 1292 BC), the last ruler of this dynasty, campaigned in this region, finally beginning to turn Egyptian interest back to the area.

This process continued in the Nineteenth Dynasty. Like his father Ramesses I, Seti I was a military commander who set out to restore Egypt&#x27;s empire to the days of the Eighteenth Dynasty pharaohs almost a century before. Inscriptions on the Karnak walls record the details of his campaigns into Canaan and ancient Syria. He took 20,000 men and reoccupied abandoned Egyptian posts and garrisoned cities. He made an informal peace with the Hittites, took control of coastal areas along the Mediterranean Sea, and continued campaigning in Canaan. A second campaign led to his capture of Kadesh and the Amurru kingdom. His son and heir, Ramesses II, campaigned with him. Historical records show a large weapons order by Ramesses II in the year before the expedition he led to Kadesh in his fifth regnal year.

At some point, both regions may have lapsed back under Hittite control. What exactly happened to Amurru is disputed. Hittitologist Trevor R. Bryce suggests, that although it may have fallen once again under Hittite control, it is more likely Amurru remained a Hittite vassal state.

The immediate antecedents to the Battle of Kadesh were the early campaigns of Ramesses II into Canaan. In the fourth year of his reign, he marched north into Syria to recapture Amurru or as a probing effort to confirm his vassals&#x27; loyalty and explore the terrain for possible battlegrounds. In the spring of the fifth year of his reign, in May 1274 BC, Ramesses II launched a campaign from his capital Pi-Ramesses (modern Qantir). The army moved beyond the fortress of Tjaru on the Horus Military Route and along the coast leading to Gaza.

The recovery of Amurru was Muwatalli II&#x27;s stated motivation for marching south to confront the Egyptians.

==Contending forces==
Ramesses led an army of four divisions: Amun, Re (pRe), Set, and the apparently newly-formed Ptah division.

There was also a poorly documented troop called the &quot;nrrn&quot; (Ne&#x27;arin or Nearin), who were possibly Canaanite military mercenaries or Egyptians, that Ramesses II had left in Amurru in order to secure the port of Sumur. This division would come to play a critical role in the battle. Also significant was the presence of Sherden troops fighting for the Egyptian army. This is the first record of them as Egyptian mercenaries. They would play an increasingly significant role in Late Bronze Age history, ultimately appearing among the Sea Peoples that ravaged the east Mediterranean at the end of the Bronze Age. Healy in &quot;Armies of the Pharaohs&quot; observes:
On the Hittite side, King Muwatalli II had mustered several of his allies, among them Rimisharrinaa, the king of Aleppo. Ramesses II recorded a long list of 19 Hittite allies brought to Kadesh by Muwatalli. This list is of considerable interest to Hittitologists, as it reflects the extent of Hittite influence at the time.

==Battle==
Muwatalli had positioned his troops behind &quot;Old Kadesh&quot;. Ramesses II was misled by two captured nomads who said the Hittite army was still far off at Aleppo. The nomads were Hittite spies sent to mislead the pharaoh. 

Ramesses ordered his forces to set up camp. He marched hastily towards Kadesh, completely unaware of the large enemy force waiting for him.

Ramesses II describes his arrival on the battlefield in the two principal inscriptions concerning the battle, the so-called &quot;Poem&quot; and the &quot;Bulletin&quot;:

As Ramesses II and the Egyptian advance guard were about 11 kilometers from Kadesh, south of Shabtuna, he met two Shasu nomads who told him that the Hittite king was &quot;in the land of Aleppo, on the north of Tunip&quot; 200 kilometers away, where, the Shasu said, he was &quot;(too much) afraid of Pharaoh, L.P.H., to come south&quot;. This was, according to Egyptian texts, a false report ordered by the Hittites &quot;with the aim of preventing the army of His Majesty from drawing up to combat with the foe of Hatti&quot;. An Egyptian scout then arrived at the camp bringing two Hittite prisoners. The prisoners revealed that the entire Hittite army and the Hittite king were actually close at hand:

After this, Ramesses II called his princes to meet with him and discuss the fault of his governors and officials in not informing the position of Muwatalli II and the Hittite army. 

Ramesses was alone with his bodyguard and the Amun division. The vizier was ordered to hasten the arrival of the Ptah and Seth divisions. The Re division had almost arrived at the camp. While Ramesses II was talking with the princes and ordering the Amun division to prepare for battle, the Hittite chariots crossed the river and charged the middle of the Ra division as they were making their way toward Ramesses II&#x27;s position. The Ra division was caught in the open and scattered in all directions. Some fled northward to the Amun camp, all the while being pursued by Hittite chariots.

The Hittite chariotry rounded north and attacked the Egyptian camp through the Amun shield wall, creating panic among the Amun division. 

The momentum of the Hittite attack began to wane as chariots were impeded by and in some cases crashing into obstacles in the large Egyptian camp. In the Egyptian account, Ramesses describes himself as being deserted and surrounded by enemies: &quot;No officer was with me, no charioteer, no soldier of the army, no shield-bearer[.]&quot;

Ramesses II was able to defeat the initial attackers and return to the Egyptian lines: &quot;I was before them like Set in his moment. I found the mass of chariots in whose midst I was, scattering them before my horses[.]&quot; The pharaoh, forced into a desperate fight for his life, called upon his god Amun and faced the enemy. Ramesses II personally led several charges into the Hittite ranks along with his personal guard, some chariots from his Amun division, and survivors from the routed Re division.

The Hittites, believing their enemies to be routed, stopped to plunder the Egyptian camp. They were subsequently driven back towards the Orontes River and away from the camp by an Egyptian counterattack. In the ensuing pursuit, Hittite chariots were overtaken and dispatched by lighter Egyptian chariots.

Having suffered this significant reversal in the battle, Muwatalli II still commanded a large force of reserve chariotry and infantry, as well as the walls of the town. As the retreat reached the river, he ordered another thousand chariots to counter-attack, led by high nobles close to the king. As the Hittite forces approached the same Egyptian camp again, the Ne&#x27;arin troop contingent from Amurru suddenly arrived, surprising the Hittites. Finally, the Ptah division arrived from the south, threatening the Hittite rear.

After six unsuccessful Hittite charges, their forces were almost surrounded and the survivors were pinned against the Orontes. The remaining Hittite elements were forced to abandon their chariots and attempt to swim the river &quot;as fast as crocodiles&quot; (according to Egyptian accounts). Many drowned.

Following the battle, the Hittites were routed, but they held on to Kadesh.

==Aftermath==

Unable to support a long siege of the walled city of Kadesh, Ramesses gathered his troops and headed south towards Damascus and ultimately back to Egypt. Ramesses proclaimed he had routed his enemies and that he had not attempted to capture Kadesh. The battle was a personal triumph for Ramesses. After moving into the ambush, facing defeat and death, the king had managed to rally his scattered troops and save the day. His new lighter and faster two-man chariots had shown their usefulness in catching up to the slower three-man Hittite chariots. In anger at the Amun division&#x27;s failure at the beginning of the battle, Ramesess had the entire division executed.

Hittite records from Hattusa tell a different conclusion to the conflict, in which Ramesses was forced to depart from Kadesh in defeat. Modern historians conclude that the battle ended in a draw from a practical point of view. It is held as a turning point for the Egyptians, who had developed new technologies and rearmed against years of territorial incursions by the Hittites.
The Hittite king, Muwatalli II, continued to campaign as far south as the Egyptian province of Upi (Apa), which he captured and placed under the control of his brother Hattusili, the future Hattusili III. Egypt&#x27;s sphere of influence in Asia was now restricted to Canaan, but the region was threatened for a time by revolts among Egypt&#x27;s vassal states in the Levant. Ramesses was compelled to embark on a series of campaigns to uphold his authority in Canaan, before he could again attack the Hittites.

In the eighth and ninth years of his reign, Ramesses extended his military successes. This time, he successfully captured the Hittite-ruled cities of Dapur and Tunip, where no Egyptian soldier had been seen since the time of Thutmose III almost 120 years earlier.

Ramesses&#x27;s victory proved ephemeral. The thin strip of territory pinched between Amurru and Kadesh was not a defensible possession. Within a year, it had returned to Hittite control. Ramesses had to march against Dapur once more in his tenth year. Neither Egypt nor Hatti could decisively defeat the other in the region.

An official peace treaty with the new Hittite king Hattusili III was signed some 15 years after the Battle of Kadesh, in the 21st year of Ramesses II&#x27;s reign (1258 BC). This concluded the borderland conflicts. The treaty was inscribed on a silver tablet, of which a clay copy was found in the Hittite capital Hattusa, now in Turkey, and is on display at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. A large replica hangs on a wall at the headquarters of the United Nations, as the earliest international peace treaty known to historians. Its text, in the Hittite version, appears in the links below. An Egyptian version survives on papyrus.

Trevor Bryce states that both sides claimed victory. Ramesses got the upper-hand at the end of Kadesh, but failed to retake Amurru and Qadesh which the dispute were about. Essentially describing an Egyptian tactical victory at Kadesh&#x27;s battlefield by preventing the Hittites from defeating the Egyptians, but an Hittite Strategic victory as it kept control over the disputed territory.

==Documentation==

There is more evidence in the form of texts and wall reliefs for this battle than for any other in the Ancient Near East. Almost all of it is from an Egyptian perspective. The first scholarly report and reconstruction of the battle was done by James Henry Breasted in 1903, based on Egyptian sources. 

Egyptian influence over Amurru and Qadesh seems to have been lost forever.

The main source of information is in the Egyptian record. The bombastic nature of Ramesses&#x27; version is recognized. The Egyptian version of the battle is recorded in two primary forms, known as the &quot;Poem&quot; and the &quot;Bulletin&quot;. The &quot;Poem&quot; has been questioned as actual verse, as opposed to a prose account similar to that recorded by other pharaohs. The &quot;Bulletin&quot; is a caption accompanying the reliefs. The inscriptions are repeated multiple times (seven for the &quot;Bulletin&quot; and eight for the &quot;Poem&quot;, in temples in Abydos, Temple of Luxor, Karnak, Abu Simbel and the Ramesseum).

In addition to these narratives, numerous small captions point out elements of the battle. Besides the inscriptions, there are textual occurrences preserved in &quot;Papyrus Raifet&quot; and &quot;Papyrus Sallier III&quot;, and a letter from Ramesses to Hattusili III written in response to a complaint by Hattusili about the pharaoh&#x27;s claims of victory in the battle.

Hittite references to the battle, including the above letter, have been found at Hattusa, but no annals have been discovered that might describe it as part of a campaign. Instead, there are various references made to it in the context of other events. That is especially true of Hattusili III for whom the battle marked an important milestone in his career.

In addition to these allies, the Hittite king also hired the services of some of the local Shasu tribes.

<text>Federico Santa María Carrera (c. August 15, 1845 - December 20, 1925) was a Chilean businessman and philanthropist. He was of Basque descent and member of the notable Carrera family.

Federico Santa María was born in Valparaíso, the son of Juan Antonio Santa María Artigas and of Magdalena Carrera Aguirre. Although he was a member of two of the most respected and influential Chilean families of the 19th century, the Santa María and the Carrera families, he made his huge fortune in the sugar markets of Paris, where he arrived when he was very young.

His importance in the sugar market was considerable: he became a major power in the French economy. During World War I he closed down all his businesses, declaring that he did not want to profit from war. He also supported the French Army, donating clothes and weapons for an entire regiment.

However, once the war ended, in 1922 he started to purchase important quantities of sugar in the stock market. As analysts later declared that sugar production would be at a deficit that year, this led to enormous profits for Santa Maria. For this success he was investigated by the French national assembly, but it was determined that he had acted within legal bounds.

Federico Santa Maria was a very atypical millionaire for his time. Profoundly anti-clerical, he never got married yet lived together for decades with the French woman Anna Guillaud.

Because he had no descendants, he gave his entire fortune to his hometown Valparaíso for the founding of a technical and engineering school. The result of his legacy was the Federico Santa María Technical University.

He was a distant relative of famous Chilean pianist Claudio Arrau.

<text>Henry Morrison Flagler (January 2, 1830 – May 20, 1913) was an American industrialist and a founder of Standard Oil, which was first based in Ohio. He was also a key figure in the development of the Atlantic coast of Florida and founder of the Florida East Coast Railway. He is also known as a co-founder and major investor of the cities of Miami and Palm Beach, Florida.

==Early life and education==
Flagler was born in Hopewell, New York. His father was Isaac Flagler, a Presbyterian minister and great-grandson of Zacharra Flegler, whose family had emigrated from the German Palatinate region to Holland in 1688. Zacharra worked in England for several years before moving to Dutchess County, New York, in 1710. His grandson Solomon changed the spelling of the surname to Flagler and passed it on to his 11 children. Flagler&#x27;s mother was Elizabeth Caldwell Harkness Flagler, Isaac&#x27;s third wife and a widow who had a stepson, Stephen V. Harkness, and a son, Daniel M. Harkness, from her marriage to deceased widower David Harkness of Milan, Ohio.

Flagler attended local schools through eighth grade. His half-brother Daniel had left Hopewell to live and work with his paternal uncle Lamon G. Harkness, who had a store in Republic, Ohio. He recruited Henry Flagler to join him, and the youth went to Ohio at age 14, where he started work in 1844 at a salary of US$5 per month plus room and board. By 1849, Flagler was promoted to the sales staff at a salary of $40 per month. He later joined Daniel in a grain business started with his uncle Lamon in Bellevue, Ohio, and made a small fortune distilling whiskey. He sold his stake in the business in 1858.

Flagler married his first wife, Mary Harkness in 1852.In 1862, Flagler and his wife&#x27;s brother-in-law Barney Hamlin York (1833–1884) founded the Flagler and York Salt Company, a salt mining and production business in Saginaw, Michigan. He found that salt mining required more technical knowledge than he had and struggled in the industry during the Civil War. The company collapsed when the war undercut commercial demand for salt. Flagler returned to Bellevue having lost his initial $50,000 investment and an additional $50,000 he had borrowed from his father-in-law and Daniel. Flagler believed that he had learned a valuable lesson: invest in a business only after thorough investigation.

==Business and Standard Oil==

After the failure of his salt business in Saginaw, Flagler returned to Bellevue in 1866 and reentered the grain business as a commission merchant with the Harkness Grain Company. During this time he worked to pay back his stepbrother. Through this business, Flagler became acquainted with John D. Rockefeller, who worked as a commission agent with Hewitt and Tuttle for the Harkness Grain Company. By the mid-1860s, Cleveland had become the center of the oil refining industry in America and Rockefeller left the grain business to start his own oil refinery. Rockefeller worked in association with chemist and inventor Samuel Andrews.
Needing capital for his new venture, Rockefeller approached Flagler in 1867. Flagler&#x27;s stepbrother Stephen V. Harkness invested $100,000 (equivalent to $ in ) on the condition that Flagler be made a partner. The Rockefeller, Andrews &amp; Flagler partnership was formed with Flagler in control of Harkness&#x27; interest. The partnership eventually grew into the Standard Oil Corporation. It was Flagler&#x27;s idea to use the rebate system to strengthen the firm&#x27;s position against competitors and the transporting enterprises alike. Flagler was in a special position to make those deals due to his connections as a grain merchant. Equivalent to a 15% discount, they put Standard Oil in position to significantly undercut other oil refineries. By 1872, it led the American oil refining industry, producing . In 1877, Flagler and his family moved to New York City, which was becoming the center of commerce in the U.S.. In 1885, Standard Oil moved its corporate headquarters to New York City to the iconic 26 Broadway location.

By the end of the American Civil War, Cleveland was one of the five main refining centers in the U.S. (besides Pittsburgh, New York City, Philadelphia, and the region in northwestern Pennsylvania where most of the oil originated).
By 1869, there was three times more kerosene refining capacity than needed to supply the market, and the capacity remained in excess for many years.
In June 1870, Flagler and Rockefeller formed Standard Oil of Ohio, which rapidly became the most profitable refiner in Ohio. Standard Oil grew to become one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads were fighting fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company in collusion with Standard and other oil men outside the main oil centers. The cartel received preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep rebates of up to 50% for their product but also rebates for the shipment of competing products. Part of this scheme was the announcement of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off a firestorm of protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, which eventually led to the discovery of Standard Oil&#x27;s part in the deal. A major New York refiner, Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off. Pennsylvania revoked the cartel&#x27;s charter, and non-preferential rates were restored for the time being.

Undeterred, though vilified for the first time by the press, Flagler and Rockefeller continued with their self-reinforcing cycle of buying competing refiners, improving the efficiency of operations, pressing for discounts on oil shipments, undercutting competition, making secret deals, raising investment pools, and buying rivals out. In less than four months in 1872, in what was later known as &quot;The Cleveland Conquest&quot; or &quot;The Cleveland Massacre&quot;, Standard Oil had absorbed 22 of its 26 Cleveland competitors. Eventually, even former antagonists Pratt and Rogers saw the futility of continuing to compete against Standard Oil: in 1874, they made a secret agreement with their old nemesis to be acquired. Pratt and Rogers became Flagler and Rockefeller&#x27;s partners. Rogers, in particular, became one of Flagler and Rockefeller&#x27;s key men in the formation of the Standard Oil Trust. Pratt&#x27;s son, Charles Millard Pratt, became Secretary of Standard Oil. For many of the competitors, Flagler and Rockefeller had merely to show them the books so they could see what they were up against and make them a decent offer. If they refused the offer, Flagler and Rockefeller told them they would run them into bankruptcy and then cheaply buy up their assets at auction. Flagler and Rockefeller saw themselves as the industry&#x27;s saviors, &quot;an angel of mercy&quot; absorbing the weak and making the industry as a whole stronger, more efficient, and more competitive. Standard was growing horizontally and vertically. It added its own pipelines, tank cars, and home delivery network. It kept oil prices low to stave off competitors, made its products affordable to the average household, and, to increase market penetration, sometimes sold below cost if necessary. It developed over 300 oil-based products from tar to paint to Vaseline petroleum jelly to chewing gum. By the end of the 1870s, Standard was refining over 90% of the oil in the U.S.
In 1877, Standard clashed with Thomas A. Scott the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, its chief hauler. Flagler and Rockefeller had envisioned the use of pipelines as an alternative transport system for oil and began a campaign to build and acquire them. The railroad, seeing Standard&#x27;s incursion into the transportation and pipeline fields, struck back and formed a subsidiary to buy and build oil refineries and pipelines.This subsidiary, the Empire Transportation Company, which Joseph D. Potts created in 1865 and also ran, owned other assets including a small fleet of ships on the Great Lakes. Standard countered and held back its shipments and, with the help of other railroads, started a price war that dramatically reduced freight payments and caused labor unrest as well. Flagler and Rockefeller eventually prevailed and the railroad sold all its oil interests to Standard. But in the aftermath of that battle, in 1879 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania indicted Flagler and Rockefeller on charges of monopolizing the oil trade, starting an avalanche of similar court proceedings in other states and making a national issue of Standard Oil&#x27;s business practices. The New York State Legislature&#x27;s Hepburn Committee in 1879 conducted hearings in response to the complaints of local merchants that were not involved in the oil trade in order to investigate railroad rebate practices. The committee ultimately discovered the previously unknown scope of Standard Oil&#x27;s business interests.

===Monopoly===
Standard Oil gradually gained almost complete control of oil refining and marketing in the United States through horizontal integration. In the kerosene industry, Standard Oil replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% over the life of the company), Standard Oil&#x27;s business practices created intense controversy. Standard&#x27;s most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates. The firm was attacked by journalists and politicians throughout its existence, in part for these monopolistic methods, giving momentum to the antitrust movement. By 1880, according to the &quot;New York World&quot;, Standard Oil was &quot;the most cruel, impudent, pitiless, and grasping monopoly that ever fastened upon a country.&quot; To the critics Flagler and Rockefeller replied, &quot;In a business so large as ours... some things are likely to be done which we cannot approve. We correct them as soon as they come to our knowledge.&quot;

At that time, many legislatures had made it difficult to incorporate in one state and operate in another. As a result, Flagler and Rockefeller and their associates owned dozens of separate corporations, each of which operated in just one state; the management of the whole enterprise was rather unwieldy. In 1882, Flagler and Rockefeller&#x27;s lawyers created an innovative form of corporation to centralize their holdings, giving birth to the Standard Oil Trust. The &quot;trust&quot; was a corporation of corporations, and the entity&#x27;s size and wealth drew much attention. Nine trustees, including Rockefeller, ran the 41 companies in the trust. The public and the press were immediately suspicious of this new legal entity, and other businesses seized upon the idea and emulated it, further inflaming public sentiment. Standard Oil had gained an aura of invincibility, always prevailing against competitors, critics, and political enemies. It had become the richest, biggest, most feared business in the world, seemingly immune to the boom and bust of the business cycle, consistently racking up profits year after year.

Its vast American empire included 20,000 domestic wells, 4,000 miles of pipeline, 5,000 tank cars, and over 100,000 employees. Its share of world oil refining topped out above 90% but slowly dropped to about 80% for the rest of the century. In spite of the formation of the trust and its perceived immunity from all competition, by the 1880s Standard Oil had passed its peak of power over the world oil market. Flagler and Rockefeller finally gave up their dream of controlling all the world&#x27;s oil refining. Rockefeller admitted later, &quot;We realized that public sentiment would be against us if we actually refined all the oil.&quot; Over time foreign competition and new finds abroad eroded his dominance. In the early 1880s, Flagler and Rockefeller created one of their most important innovations. Rather than try to influence the price of crude oil directly, Standard Oil had been exercising indirect control by altering oil storage charges to suit market conditions. Flagler and Rockefeller then decided to issue certificates against oil stored in Standard Oil&#x27;s pipelines. These certificates became traded by speculators, thus creating the first oil-futures market which effectively set spot market prices from then on. The National Petroleum Exchange opened in Manhattan in late 1882 to facilitate the oil futures trading.

Even though 85% of world crude production was still coming from Pennsylvania wells in the 1880s, overseas drilling in Russia and Asia began to reach the world market. Robert Nobel had established his own refining enterprise in the abundant and cheaper Russian oil fields, including the region&#x27;s first pipeline and the world&#x27;s first oil tanker. The Paris Rothschilds jumped into the fray providing financing. Additional fields were discovered in Burma and Java. Even more critical, the invention of the light bulb gradually began to erode the dominance of kerosene for illumination. But Standard Oil adapted, developing its own European presence, expanding into natural gas production in the U.S., then into gasoline for automobiles, which until then had been considered a waste product.

Standard Oil moved its headquarters to New York City, at 26 Broadway, and Flagler and Rockefeller became central figures in the city&#x27;s business community.
In 1887, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission, which was tasked with enforcing equal rates for all railroad freight, but by then Standard depended more on pipeline transport. More threatening to Standard&#x27;s power was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, originally used to control unions, but later central to the breakup of the Standard Oil trust. Ohio was especially vigorous in applying its state anti-trust laws, and finally forced a separation of Standard Oil of Ohio from the rest of the company in 1892, the first step in the dissolution of the trust.

Upon his ascent to the presidency, Theodore Roosevelt initiated dozens of suits under the Sherman Antitrust Act and coaxed reforms out of Congress. In 1901, U.S. Steel, now controlled by J. Pierpont Morgan, having bought Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s steel assets, offered to buy Standard&#x27;s iron interests as well. A deal brokered by Henry Clay Frick exchanged Standard&#x27;s iron interests for U.S. Steel stock and gave Rockefeller and his son membership on the company&#x27;s board of directors.
One of the most effective attacks on Flagler and Rockefeller and their firm was the 1905 publication of &quot;The History of the Standard Oil Company,&quot; by Ida Tarbell, a leading muckraker. She documented the company&#x27;s espionage, price wars, heavy-handed marketing tactics, and courtroom evasions. Although her work prompted a huge backlash against the company, Tarbell claims to have been surprised at its magnitude. &quot;I never had an animus against their size and wealth, never objected to their corporate form. I was willing that they should combine and grow as big and wealthy as they could, but only by legitimate means. But they had never played fair, and that ruined their greatness for me.&quot; Tarbell&#x27;s father had been driven out of the oil business during the South Improvement Company affair.

Flagler and Rockefeller began a publicity campaign to put the company and themselves in a better light. Though Flagler and Rockefeller had long maintained a policy of active silence with the press, they decided to make themselves more accessible and responded with conciliatory comments such as &quot;capital and labor are both wild forces which require intelligent legislation to hold them in restriction.&quot;

Flagler and Rockefeller continued to consolidate their oil interests as best they could until New Jersey, in 1909, changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re-creation of the trust in the form of a single holding company. Rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until 1911 and he kept his stock. At last in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By then the trust still had a 70% market share of the refined oil market but only 14% of the U.S. crude oil supply. The court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 new companies. These included, among many others, Continental Oil, which became Conoco, now part of ConocoPhillips; Pennzoil, now part of Shell; Standard of Indiana, which became Amoco, now part of BP; Standard of California, which became Chevron, still a separate company; Standard of New Jersey, which became Esso (and later, Exxon), now part of ExxonMobil; Standard of New York, which became Mobil, now part of ExxonMobil; and Standard of Ohio, which became Sohio, now part of BP.

===Flagler&#x27;s contributions===
When Flagler envisioned successes in the oil industry, he and Rockefeller started building their fortune in refining oil in Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland became very well known for oil refining, as, &quot;More and more crude oil was shipped from the oil regions to Cleveland for the refining process because of transportation facilities and the aggressiveness of the refiners there. It was due largely to the efforts of Henry M. Flagler and John D. Rockefeller.&quot; Flagler and Rockefeller worked hard for their company to achieve such prominence. Henry explained: &quot;We worked night and day, making good oil as cheaply as possible and selling it for all we could get.&quot; Not only did Flagler and Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil company become well known in Ohio, they expanded to other states, as well as gained additional capital in purchasing smaller oil refining companies across the nation. According to Allan Nevins, in &quot;John D. Rockefeller&quot; (p 292), &quot;Standard Oil was born as a big enterprise, it had cut its teeth as a partnership and was now ready to plunge forward into a period of greater expansion and development. It soon was doing one tenth of all the petroleum business in the United States. Besides its two refineries and a barrel plant in Cleveland, it possessed a fleet of tank cars and warehouses in the oil regions as well as warehouses and tanks in New York.&quot;

By 1892, Standard Oil had a monopoly over all oil refineries in the United States. In an overall calculation of America&#x27;s oil refineries&#x27; assets and capital, Standard Oil surpassed all. Standard Oil&#x27;s combined assets equalled approximately $42,882,650 (equivalent to $ in ) in Indiana, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York and Ohio. Standard Oil also had the highest capitalization, totaling $26,000,000 (equivalent to $ in ). 

Although Standard Oil was a partnership, Flagler was credited as the brain behind the booming oil refining business. &quot;When John D. Rockefeller was asked if the Standard Oil company was the result of his thinking, he answered, &#x27;No, sir. I wish I had the brains to think of it. It was Henry M. Flagler.&#x27;&quot; Flagler served as an active part of Standard Oil until 1882, when he stepped back to take a secondary role at Standard Oil. He served as a vice president through 1908 and was part of ownership until 1911.

==Florida: resort hotels and railroads==
When Flagler&#x27;s first wife Mary (née Harkness) fell sick, his physician recommended they travel to Jacksonville for the winter to escape the brutal conditions of the North. For the first time, Flagler was able to experience the warm, sunny atmosphere of Florida. Two years after his first wife died in 1881, he married again. Ida Alice (née Shourds) Flagler had been a caregiver for Mary. After their wedding, the couple traveled to Saint Augustine. Flagler found the city charming, but the hotel facilities and transportation systems inadequate. Franklin W. Smith had just finished building Villa Zorayda and Flagler offered to buy it for his honeymoon. Smith would not sell, but he planted the seed of St. Augustine&#x27;s and Florida&#x27;s future in Flagler&#x27;s mind.

Although Flagler remained on the board of directors of Standard Oil, he gave up his day-to-day involvement in the corporation to pursue his interests in Florida. He returned to St. Augustine in 1885 and made Smith an offer. If Smith could raise $50,000, Flagler would invest $150,000 and they would build a hotel together. Perhaps fortunately for Smith, he couldn&#x27;t come up with the funds, so Flagler began construction of the 540-room Ponce de Leon Hotel by himself, but spent several times his original estimate. Smith helped train the masons on the mixing and pouring techniques he used on Zorayda.

Realizing the need for a sound transportation system to support his hotel ventures, Flagler purchased short line railroads in what would later become known as the Florida East Coast Railway. He used convict leasing — &quot;a method undertaken by the Southern States to replace the economic setup of slavery&quot; — to modernize the existing railroads, allowing them to accommodate heavier loads and more traffic.

His next project was the Ponce de Leon Hotel, now part of Flagler College. He invested with the guidance of Dr. Andrew Anderson, a native of St. Augustine. After many years of work, it opened on January 10, 1888, and was an instant success.

This project sparked Flagler&#x27;s interest in creating a new &quot;American Riviera.&quot; Two years later, he expanded his Florida holdings. He built a railroad bridge across the St. Johns River to gain access to the southern half of the state and purchased the Hotel Ormond, just north of Daytona. He also built the Alcazar Hotel as an overflow hotel for the Ponce de Leon Hotel. The Alcazar is today the Lightner Museum, next to the Casa Monica Hotel in St. Augustine that Flagler bought from Franklin W. Smith. His personal dedication to the state of Florida was demonstrated when he began construction on his private residence, Kirkside, in St. Augustine.

An immense engineering effort was required to cut through the wilderness and marsh from St. Augustine to Palm Beach. The state provided incentive in the form of for every mile () of track constructed.
Flagler completed the 1,100-room Royal Poinciana Hotel on the shores of Lake Worth in Palm Beach and extended his railroad to its service town, West Palm Beach, by 1894, founding Palm Beach and West Palm Beach. The Royal Poinciana Hotel was at the time the largest wooden structure in the world. Two years later, Flagler built the Palm Beach Inn (renamed The Breakers in 1901), overlooking the Atlantic Ocean in Palm Beach.

Flagler originally intended West Palm Beach to be the terminus of his railroad system, but in 1894 and 1895, severe freezes hit the area, causing Flagler to reconsider. south, the area today known as Miami was reportedly unharmed by the freeze. To further convince Flagler to continue the railroad to Miami, he was offered land in exchange for laying rail tracks from private landowners, the Florida East Coast Canal and Transportation Company, and the Boston and Florida Atlantic Coast Land Company. The land owners were Julia Tuttle, whom he had met in Cleveland, Ohio, and William Brickell, who ran a trading post on the Miami River.

Such incentive led to the development of Miami, which was an unincorporated area at the time. Flagler encouraged fruit farming and settlement along his railway line and made many gifts to build hospitals, churches and schools in Florida.

By 1896, Flagler&#x27;s railroad, the Florida East Coast Railway, reached Biscayne Bay. Flagler dredged a channel, built streets, instituted the first water and power systems, and financed the city&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Metropolis&quot;. When the city was incorporated in 1896, its citizens wanted to honor the man responsible for its growth by naming it &quot;Flagler&quot;. He declined the honor, persuading them to use an old Indian name, &quot;Mayaimi&quot;. Instead, an artificial island was constructed in Biscayne Bay called Flagler Monument Island. In 1897, Flagler opened the exclusive Royal Palm Hotel on the north bank of the Miami River where it overlooked Biscayne Bay. He became known as the Father of Miami, Florida.

Flagler&#x27;s second wife, the former Ida Alice Shourds, was declared insane by Flagler&#x27;s friend Dr. Anderson in 1896 and was institutionalized on and off starting that year. At the same time, he began to have an affair with Mary Lily Kenan; by 1899, newspapers began to openly question whether the two were having an affair. That year he reportedly gave her more than $1 million in jewelry. In 1901, Flagler bribed the Florida Legislature and Governor to pass a law that made incurable insanity grounds for divorce, opening the way for Flagler to remarry. Flagler was the only person to be divorced under the law before it was repealed in 1905. It was not until 1969 that a spouse&#x27;s incurable insanity (mental incapacity) again became a ground for divorce in Florida. It remains a ground today, but since Florida became a &quot;no fault&quot; divorce state in 1971, there is less need to use that ground to obtain a divorce (dissolution of marriage).

On August 24, 1901, 10 days after his divorce, Flagler married Mary Lily at her family&#x27;s plantation, Liberty Hall, and the couple soon moved into their new Palm Beach estate, Whitehall, a 55-room beaux arts home designed by the New York-based firm of Carrère and Hastings, which also had designed the New York Public Library and the Pan-American Exposition. Built in 1902 as a wedding present to Mary Lily, Whitehall (now the Flagler Museum) was a 60,000-square-foot (5,600 m2) winter retreat that established the Palm Beach &quot;season&quot; of about 8–12 weeks, for the wealthy of America&#x27;s Gilded Age.
By 1905, Flagler decided that his Florida East Coast Railway should be extended from Biscayne Bay to Key West, a point past the end of the Florida peninsula. At the time, Key West was Florida&#x27;s most populous city, with a population of 20,000, and it was also the United States&#x27; deep water port closest to the canal that the U.S. government proposed to build in Panama. Flagler wanted to take advantage of additional trade with Cuba and Latin America as well as the increased trade with the west that the Panama Canal would bring.

In 1912, the Florida Overseas Railroad was completed to Key West. Over 30 years, Flagler had invested about $50 million in railroad, home and hotel construction and had made donations to suffering farmers after the freeze in 1894. When asked by the president of Rollins College in Winter Park about his philanthropic efforts, Flagler reportedly replied, &quot;I believe this state is the easiest place for many men to gain a living. I do not believe any one else would develop it if I do not..., but I do hope to live long enough to prove I am a good business man by getting a dividend on my investment.&quot;

== Alleged use of convict leasing and debt peonage ==
Flagler allegedly used convicts leased from Florida prison camps, the majority of them African-American, to clear land for the Royal Palm Hotel in Miami and to build the Florida East Coast Railway from West Palm Beach to Miami and the rail extension to Key West. He also used labor agencies to bring around 4,000 new immigrants to Florida who contracted to work until their transportation costs had been paid off. Due to the harsh working and living conditions in the railway construction camps, many workers became victims of debt slavery.

When the Department of Justice prosecuted four Flagler employment agents in 1908 for &quot;conspiracy to hold workmen in peonage and slavery,&quot; the Flagler-owned &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; and other Florida newspapers depending on the &quot;Times-Union&quot; for material or owned by Flagler published articles to &quot;influence juries and public opinion.&quot; The judge instructed the jury to find them not guilty because the &quot;prosecution had failed to prove &#x27;an agreement of minds with evil intent to conspire&#x27;.&quot;

A congressional investigation in 1909 concluded that &quot;there had been little immigrant peonage in the South and none in the ... [railway camps] camps in the Keys. Congress concluded that newspapers in Florida and across the South spread the deceitful news against Flagler.&quot;

According to historian Joe Knetsch, reformers and muckrakers exaggerated charges of peonage regarding construction of the Florida East Coast Railway in 1893 to 1909. Flager and his lawyers defeated all legal challenges and neither the company or its employees were ever convicted in court. However, there were many reports of harsh working conditions and forced indebtedness to the company, and malfeasance by labor agents who hired men for the railway. Knetsch concludes that &quot;Flagler in fact provided health care for his employees and was a far better employer than the press alleged.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
In March 1913, Flagler fell down a flight of marble stairs at Whitehall. He never recovered and died in Palm Beach of his injuries on May 20, 1913, at 83 years of age. At 3 p.m. on the day of the funeral, May 23, 1913, every engine on the Florida East Coast Railway stopped wherever it was for ten minutes as a tribute to Flagler. It was reported that people along the railway line waited all night for the passing of the funeral train as it traveled from Palm Beach to St. Augustine.

Flagler was entombed in the Flagler family mausoleum at Memorial Presbyterian Church in St. Augustine alongside his first wife, Mary Harkness; daughter, Jennie Louise (née Flagler) Benedict; and granddaughter, Margery [Benedict]. Only his son Harry Harkness Flagler survived of the three children by his first marriage in 1853 to Mary Harkness. A large portion of his estate was designated for a &quot;niece&quot; who was said actually to be a child born out of wedlock.

When looking back at Flagler&#x27;s life, after Flagler&#x27;s death, George W. Perkins, of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., reflected, &quot;But that any man could have the genius to see of what this wilderness of waterless sand and underbrush was capable and then have the nerve to build a railroad here, is more marvelous than similar development anywhere else in the world.&quot;

Miami&#x27;s main east–west street is named Flagler Street and is the main shopping street in Downtown Miami. Flagler Avenue is a main route through Key West. There is also a monument to him on Flagler Monument Island in Biscayne Bay in Miami; Flagler College and Flagler Hospital are named after him in St. Augustine. Flagler County, Florida, Flagler Beach, Florida, and Flagler, Colorado, are also named for him. Whitehall, Palm Beach, is open to the public as the Henry Morrison Flagler Museum; his private railcar No. 91 is preserved inside a Beaux Arts pavilion built to look like a 19th-century railway palace.

On February 24, 2006, a statue of Flagler was unveiled in Key West near the spot where the Overseas Railroad once terminated. Also, on July 28, 2006, a statue of Flagler was unveiled on the southeast steps of Miami&#x27;s Dade County Courthouse, located on Miami&#x27;s Flagler Street.

The Overseas Railroad, also known as the Key West Extension of the Florida East Coast Railway, was heavily damaged and partially destroyed in the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935. The railroad was financially unable to rebuild the destroyed sections, so the roadbed and remaining bridges were sold to the State of Florida, which built the Overseas Highway to Key West, using much of the remaining railway infrastructure.

Flagler&#x27;s third wife, Mary Lily Kenan Flagler Bingham was born in North Carolina. The top-ranked Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is named for Flagler and his wife, who was an early benefactor of UNC along with her family and descendants. After Flagler&#x27;s death, she married an old friend, Robert Worth Bingham, who used an inheritance from her to buy the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal.&quot; The Bingham-Flagler marriage (and questions about her death or possible murder) figured prominently in several books that appeared in the 1980s, when the Bingham family sold the newspaper in the midst of great acrimony. Control of the Flagler fortune largely passed into the hands of Mary Lily Kenan&#x27;s family of sisters and brother, who survived into the 1960s.

<text>Currier and Ives was a New York City-based printmaking business operating from 1835 to 1907. Founded by Nathaniel Currier, the company designed and sold inexpensive hand-painted lithographic works based on news events, views of popular culture and Americana. Advertising itself as &quot;the Grand Central Depot for Cheap and Popular Prints&quot;, the corporate name was changed in 1857 to &quot;Currier and Ives&quot; with the addition of James Merritt Ives.

A perennial bestselling series was the Darktown Comics lithographs.

==History==
Nathaniel Currier (1813–88) was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, on March 27, 1813, the second of four children. His parents Nathaniel and Hannah Currier were distant cousins who lived a humble and spartan life. Tragedy struck when Nathaniel was eight years old, when his father unexpectedly died, leaving Nathaniel and his eleven-year-old brother Lorenzo to provide for the family: six-year-old sister Elizabeth and two-year-old brother Charles, as well as their mother.

Nathaniel worked a series of odd jobs to support the family and, at fifteen, he started what became a lifelong career when he apprenticed in the Boston lithography shop of William and John Pendleton. In 1833 at age twenty, he moved to Philadelphia to do contract work for M.E.D. Brown, a noted engraver and printer. Currier&#x27;s early lithographs were issued under the name of Stodart &amp; Currier, a result of the partnership that he created in 1834 with a local New York printmaker named Stodart. The two men specialized in &quot;job&quot; printing and made a variety of print products, including music manuscripts. Currier became dissatisfied with the poor economic return of their business venture and ended the partnership in 1835. He set up shop alone, working as &quot;N. Currier, Lithographer&quot; until 1856.

In 1835, he created a lithograph that illustrated a fire sweeping through New York City&#x27;s business district. The print of the Merchant&#x27;s Exchange sold thousands of copies in four days. Currier realized that there was a market for current news, so he turned out several more disaster prints and other inexpensive lithographs that illustrated local and national events, such as &quot;&quot;Ruins of the Planter&#x27;s Hotel, New Orleans, which fell at two O&#x27;clock on the Morning of May 15, 1835, burying 50 persons, 40 of whom Escaped with their Lives&quot;. He quickly gained a reputation as an accomplished lithographer. In 1840, he produced &quot;Awful Conflagration of the Steam Boat &quot;Lexington&quot;&quot;, which was so successful that he was given a weekly insert in the &quot;New York Sun&quot;. In that year, Currier&#x27;s firm began to shift its focus from job printing to independent print publishing.

==Partnership with Ives==

The name Currier and Ives first appeared in 1857, when Currier invited the company&#x27;s bookkeeper and accountant James Merritt Ives (1824–95) to become his partner. Ives was born on March 5, 1824, in New York City, and he married Caroline Clark in 1852. She was the sister-in-law of Nathaniel&#x27;s brother Charles Currier, and it was Charles who recommended Ives to his brother. Nathaniel Currier soon noticed Ives&#x27;s dedication to his business, and his artistic knowledge and insight into what the public wanted. The younger man quickly became the general manager of the firm, handling the financial side of the business by modernizing the bookkeeping, reorganizing inventory, and streamlining the print process. Ives also helped Currier interview potential artists and craftsmen. He had a flair for gauging popular interests and aided in selecting the images that the firm would publish and expanding the firm&#x27;s range to include political satire and sentimental scenes, such as sleigh rides in the country and steamboat races. In 1857, Currier made Ives a full partner.

==The firm==
The firm Currier and Ives described itself as &quot;Publishers of Cheap and Popular Prints&quot;. At least 7,500 lithographs were published in the firm&#x27;s 72 years of operation. Artists produced two to three new images every week for 64 years (1834–1895), producing more than a million prints by hand-colored lithography. For the original drawings, Currier and Ives employed or used the work of many celebrated artists of the day, including James E. Buttersworth, George Inness, Thomas Nast, Eastman Johnson, and others. The stars of the firm were Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait, who specialized in sporting scenes; Louis Maurer, who executed genre scenes; George H. Durrie, who supplied winter scenes; and Frances Flora Bond Palmer, who liked to do picturesque panoramas of the American landscape, and who was the first woman in the United States to make her living as a full-time artist.

All lithographs were produced on lithographic limestone printing plates on which the drawing was done by hand. A stone often took over a week to prepare for printing. Each print was pulled by hand. Prints were hand-colored by a dozen or more women, often immigrants from Germany with an art background. They worked in assembly-line fashion, one color to a worker, and were paid $6 for every 100 colored prints. The favored colors were clear and simple, and the drawing was bold and direct.

The earliest lithographs were printed in black and then colored by hand. As new techniques were developed, publishers began to produce full-color lithographs that gradually developed softer, more painterly effects. Skilled artist lithographers such as John Cameron, Fanny Palmer, and others became known for their work and signed important pieces. Artists such as A. F. Tait became famous when their paintings were reproduced as lithographs.

Currier and Ives was the most prolific and successful company of lithographers in the U.S. Its lithographs represented every phase of American life, and included the themes of hunting, fishing, whaling, city life, rural scenes, historical scenes, clipper ships, yachts, steamships, the Mississippi River, Hudson River scenes, railroads, politics, comedy, gold mining, winter scenes, commentary on life, portraits, and still lifes. From 1866 on, the firm occupied three floors in a building at 33 Spruce Street in New York:

*Hand-operated printing presses occupied the third floor.
*Artists, stone grinders, and lithographers worked on the fourth floor.
*Colorists worked on the fifth floor.

Small works sold for five to twenty cents each, and large works sold for $1 to $3 apiece. The Currier and Ives firm branched out from its central shop in New York City to sell prints via pushcart vendors, peddlers, and book stores. The firm sold retail as well as wholesale, establishing outlets in cities across the country and in London. It also sold work through the mail (prepaid orders only), and internationally through a London office and agents in Europe.

The 19th-century Victorian public was receptive to the firm&#x27;s products, with its interest in current events and sentimental taste. Currier and Ives prints were among the most popular wall hangings of the day. In 1872, the Currier and Ives catalog proudly proclaimed: &quot;our Prints have become a staple article... in great demand in every part of the country... In fact without exception, all that we have published have met with a quick and ready sale.&quot;

Currier and Ives prints were among the household decorations considered appropriate for a proper home by Catharine Esther Beecher and Harriet Beecher Stowe, authors of &quot;American Woman&#x27;s Home&quot; (1869): &quot;The great value of pictures for the home would be, after all, in their sentiment. They should express the sincere ideas and tastes of the household and not the tyrannical dicta of some art critic or neighbor.&quot;

Currier died in 1888. Ives remained active in the firm until his death in 1895. Both Currier&#x27;s and Ives&#x27;s sons followed their fathers in the business, which was eventually liquidated in 1907. The public demand for lithographs had gradually diminished because of improvements in offset printing and photoengraving.

==The lithographs==
The prints depicted a variety of images of American life, including winter scenes, horse-racing images, portraits of people, and pictures of ships, sporting events, patriotic, and historical events, including ferocious battles of the American Civil War, the building of cities and railroads, and Lincoln&#x27;s assassination. Currier and Ives also produced many prints that were inherently racist in nature, particularly in a series of prints called the Darktown Comics. They depicted African Americans in very demeaning ways, making a very clear mockery of them to their white counterparts. These types of images were popular in the 19th century and in high demand. Many of these images are still readily available to view and purchase. 

The original lithographs shared similar characteristics in inking and paper, and adhered to folio sizes. Sizes of the images were standard (trade cards, very small folios, small folios, medium folios, large folios), and their measurement did not include the title or borders. These sizes are one of the guides for collectors today in determining if the print is an original or not. &quot;Currier used a cotton based, medium to heavy weight paper depending on the folio size for his prints until the late 1860s. From about 1870, Currier and Ives used paper mixed with a small amount of wood pulp.&quot; In addition, Currier&#x27;s inking process resembled a mixture of elongated splotches and dashes of ink with a few spots, a characteristic that modern reproductions would not possess.

In 1907, the firm was liquidated and most of the lithographic stones had the image removed and were sold by the pound, with some stones&#x27; final home being as land fill in Central Park. Those few stones that managed to survive intact were of large folio Clipper Ships, small folio Dark Town Comics, a medium folio &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; and a small folio &quot;Washington As A Mason&quot;.

Today, original Currier and Ives prints are much sought by collectors, and modern reproductions of them are popular decorations. Especially popular are the winter scenes, which are commonly used for American Christmas cards. In 2019 a print of &quot;Across the Continent&quot; by Fanny Palmer sold at auction for over US$60,000.

===Racist lithographs===

Currier and Ives, because they were targeting a middle-class American customer, inadvertently created a &quot;pictorial record&quot; of values in the United States in the 19th century, which included contemporary racism. According to Albert Baragwanath, of the approximately 500 &quot;comic prints&quot; produced by Currier and Ives, &quot;more than half of these were the so-called Darktown Comics whose humor lay in gross burlesque.&quot;

The Darktown Comics series was perennially among the bestselling of Currier and Ives&#x27; over 7000 lithographs, with at least one selling 73,000 copies via pushcarts and in shops and country stores. According to J. Michael Martinez, every one of the series was a bestseller.

Thomas Worth recreated a previous Statue of Liberty image, using an African American woman similar to the mammy figure holding a torch as part of their Darktown Comics series.

<text>The Carrera family from Alegría de Oria (Basque Country) became politically influential during the colonial period and played a significant role in the Chilean independence. They remained politically important throughout the 19th century.

== Genealogy ==
* María Nicolasa de Valdés y de la Carrera (1733–1810), first First Lady of Chile
* Ignacio de la Carrera (1747–1819), member of Chile&#x27;s first ruling junta in 1810.

The children of Ignacio de la Carrera are known in Chilean history as the &quot;Hermanos Carrera&quot; (Carrera siblings). All except Javiera were military commanders in the fight against Spanish reconquest:
* Javiera Carrera (1771–1862), &quot;Mother&quot; of Chile, who sewed its first flag
* Brigadier Juan José Carrera (1782–1818), independentist hero
* General José Miguel Carrera (1785–1821), independentist leader, who governed Chile during its first period of independence, the &quot;Patria Vieja&quot;. 
* Colonel Luis Carrera (1791–1818), independentist hero

Other descendants also notable in their time:
* José Miguel Carrera Fontecilla (1821–1860), leader of the Chilean Civil War of 1851
* José Miguel Valdés Carrera (1837–1898), politician and several times minister
* Luis Aldunate Carrera (1842–1908) politician and several times minister
* Ignacio Carrera Pinto (1848–1882), soldier and hero of the Battle of La Concepcion during the War of the Pacific.
* Manuel Carrera Pinto (1854–1895) politician
* Federico Santa María Carrera (1845–1925) businessman and philanthropist
* María Elena Carrera Villavicencio (1929), politician

The Carrera name has disappeared by way of marriage from Chilean society, but their descendants, who number in the few hundred, are socially, politically and financially prominent.

<doc id="390064" wikidata="Q800715" url="?curid=390064" title="Ebisu Station (Tokyo)">
<text>is a railway station in the Ebisu neighborhood of Tokyo&#x27;s Shibuya ward, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and the Tokyo subway operator Tokyo Metro. The station is named after Yebisu Beer, which was once brewed in an adjacent brewery, and which is itself named for the Japanese deity Ebisu.

==Lines==
Ebisu is served by the following lines:
*East Japan Railway Company (JR East)
**Yamanote Line
**Saikyō Line
**Shōnan-Shinjuku Line
*Tokyo Metro
**Hibiya Line

==JR East station==
===Platforms===
The JR East station consists of two island platforms serving four tracks.



===Station melody===
The melody known as &quot;The Third Man Theme&quot; (or as the &quot;Ebisu Theme&quot; in Japan) is played at the platforms just prior to train departures. This melody was used in Ebisu beer TV commercials. Most of the many of thousands of people who pass through the station each day probably do not realize that the song was made famous by the 1949 Orson Welles film noir, The Third Man, written by Graham Greene and featuring a very dark subject matter, the sale of fake penicillin in post-World War Vienna. The song, played on the zither by the previously unknown Austrian musician, Anton Karas, was a huge international hit in 1949 and 1950.

==Tokyo Metro station==
===Platforms===
The subway station has two side platforms serving two tracks.


==History==
The station first opened in 1901 as a freight terminal for the neighboring Yebisu Beer factory. Passenger trains began to stop at the station on 30 September 1906. The Tokyo Tamagawa tram line was extended to the station in 1927. In May 1945, the station building burned to the ground amid the bombing of Tokyo. The subway station opened on 25 March 1964 and the tram service was discontinued in 1967.

The Sapporo Brewery at Ebisu and its accompanying rail freight terminal were closed in 1982. The space was used for a &quot;car train&quot; service for several years before being redeveloped as the Ebisu Garden Place high-rise complex.

The Saikyo Line was extended to Ebisu in 1996. Through service to the Shonan-Shinjuku Line began in 2001, and to the Rinkai Line in 2002. Between 1996 and 2002, Ebisu served as the southern passenger terminus of the Saikyo Line, with Osaki Station being used as a turnaround point but not having passenger platforms connected to the line.

The station facilities of the Hibiya Line were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

Chest-height platform edge doors were introduced on the two Yamanote Line platforms from 26 June 2010, the first time that such doors were installed on a JR line other than the Shinkansen.

Station numbering was introduced to the JR East platforms in 2016 with Ebisu being assigned station numbers JA09 for the Saikyo Line, JS18 for the Shonan-Shinjuku line, JY21 for the Yamanote Line. At the same time, JR East assigned the station a 3-letter code; Ebisu was assigned the code &quot;EBS&quot;.

Morning &quot;TH Liner&quot; services terminating at this station commenced on 6 June 2020.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2019, the JR East station was used by 145,805 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the 20th-busiest station operated by JR East. In fiscal 2019, the Tokyo Metro station was used by an average of 117,796 passengers per day (exiting and entering passengers), making it the 30th-busiest station operated by Tokyo Metro.

The daily passenger figures for each operator in previous years are as shown below.

<text>The Tokyo Metro (Japanese: , ) is a major rapid transit system in Tokyo, Japan, operated by the Tokyo Metro Co. With an average daily ridership of 6.52 million passengers (as of 2023), the Tokyo Metro is the larger of the two subway operators in the city; the other being the Toei Subway, with 2.85 million average daily rides.

==Organization==
Tokyo Metro is operated by , a joint-stock company jointly owned by the Government of Japan and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.

The company, founded as a part of then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi&#x27;s policy of converting statutory corporations into joint-stock companies, replaced the , commonly known as Eidan or TRTA, on April 1, 2004. TRTA was administered by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, and jointly funded by the national and metropolitan governments. It was formed in 1941 as a part-nationalization of the Tokyo Underground Railway and Tokyo Rapid Railway (now both form the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line), although its oldest lines date back to 1927 with the opening of the Tokyo Underground Railway the same year. Upon its establishment, the TRTA&#x27;s legal form was a , a form of entity established by the government of the wartime cabinet of the Empire of Japan with both public and private sector investments. Private sector investments to the TRTA were prohibited in 1951 when it was converted into an ordinary statutory corporation. In 2024, the company made its initial public offering, raising $2.3 billion in what became Japan&#x27;s biggest IPO since 2018.

The other major subway operator is Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation (Toei Subway) which is owned solely by the government of Tokyo. Tokyo Metro and Toei trains form completely separate networks, although Tokyo Metro Namboku Line and Toei Mita Line share the same track between Meguro Station and Shirokane-takanawa Station. Users of prepaid rail passes and Suica/Pasmo smart cards can freely interchange between the two networks (as well as other rail companies in the area), but fares are assessed separately for legs on each of these systems and regular ticket holders must purchase a second ticket, or a special transfer ticket, to change from a Toei line to a Tokyo Metro line and vice versa. Though, most Tokyo Metro (and Toei) line offer through service to lines outside of central Tokyo run by other carriers, and this can somewhat complicate the ticketing.

Much effort has been made to make the system accessible to non-Japanese speaking users:

* Many train stops are announced in both English and Japanese. Announcements also provide connecting line information.
* Ticket machines can switch between English and Japanese user interfaces.
* Train stations are signposted in English and Japanese (in kanji and hiragana). There are also numerous signs in Chinese (in simplified characters) and Korean.
* Train stations are now also consecutively numbered on each color-coded line, allowing even non-English speakers to be able to commute without necessarily knowing the name of the station. For example, Shinjuku Station on the Marunouchi Line is also signposted as M-08 with a red colored circle surrounding it; even if a commuter could not read the English or Japanese station names on signs or maps, they could simply look for the red line and then find the appropriately numbered station on said line. In addition, some trains have interior LCD displays which display station names in Japanese, English, Chinese, and Korean.

Many stations are also designed to help blind people as railings often have Braille at their base, and raised yellow rubber guide strips are used on flooring throughout the network.

Tokyo Metro stations began accepting contactless (RFID) Pasmo stored value cards in March 2007 to pay fares, and the JR East Suica system is also universally accepted. Both these passes also can be used on surrounding rail systems throughout the area and many rail lines in other areas of Japan. Due to the complexity of the fare systems in Japan, most riders converted to these cards very quickly even though there is an additional charge to issue it.

The Tokyo Metro is extremely punctual and has regular trains arriving 3 to 6 minutes apart most of the day and night. However, it does not run 24 hours a day. While through service with other companies complicates this somewhat, the last train generally starts at midnight and completes its service by 00:45 to 01:00, and the first train generally starts at 05:00.

Tokyo Metro also owns a number of commercial developments which mostly consist of shopping developments at major stations. It also owns the Subway Museum near Kasai Station on the Tokyo Metro Tōzai Line which opened on July 12, 1986, and features a few retired trains which once operated on the Ginza and Marunouchi Lines as well as a maintenance vehicle and some train simulators.

In 2024, Tokyo Metro was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, debuting as the exchange&#x27;s largest IPO in six years and with a market capitalization of roughly 1 trillion yen. The Government of Japan and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government each sold half of their shares, with the former using the proceeds to repay bonds funding reconstruction after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

=== Overseas affiliates ===
In 2017, Tokyo Metro opened its affiliate in Hanoi, Vietnam, as part of preparations to be the service operator of Hanoi Metro. The Hanoi Metro opened in 2021. 

In November 2024, GTS Rail Operations (a consortium comprising Go-Ahead Group, Tokyo Metro and Sumitomo Corporation) was chosen from four bidders to operate the Elizabeth line in London, england for seven years from May 2025 with an option to extend for two years.

==Future expansion==
Tokyo Metro indicated in its public share offering that it would cease line construction once the Fukutoshin Line was completed. That line was completed in March 2013 with the opening of the connection with the Tōkyū Tōyoko Line at Shibuya Station, allowing through service as far as Motomachi-Chūkagai Station in Yokohama. There are several lines such as the Hanzōmon Line that still have extensions in their official plans, and in the past, these plans have tended to happen, though often over several decades.

In March 2022, Tokyo Metro received permission to add two new extensions to the network. Under these plans, the Yūrakuchō Line would receive a new branch from Toyosu Station to Sumiyoshi Station with three new stops (including one at Toyocho Station on the Tōzai Line) to better serve the Toyosu urban development zone, and the Namboku Line would receive an extension from Shirokane-Takanawa Station to Shinagawa Station, where it would connect with the Tokaido Shinkansen and the under construction Chūō Shinkansen in addition to serving the surrounding business district. Both extensions are expected to open in the 2030s.

==Fares==
Pasmo and Suica are accepted on the Tokyo Metro, as well as on railway stations operated by other companies. Transfers between Tokyo Metro subway lines and Toei Subway lines are usually not free, but a discount is given when using the Pasmo or Suica cards to transfer between lines.

==Traffic==
According to the company, an average of 6.33 million people used the company&#x27;s nine subway routes each day in 2009. The company made a profit of ¥63.5 billion in 2009.

==Lines==
Altogether, the Tokyo Metro is made up of nine lines operating on of route.

===List of Tokyo Metro lines===
&quot;Note:&quot; Line numbers are for internal usage only and not listed on subway maps.
&quot;Note:&quot; Excluding the stretch between Wakoshi and Kotake-mukaihara shared with Yurakucho Line.

===Through services to other lines===
All lines except the Ginza and Marunouchi lines have trains that run through line termini onto tracks owned by other companies.
* Namboku Line shares tracks of the section from Meguro to with Toei Mita Line, 2.3 km.
* Some of the Tōkyū Tōyoko Line express trains, instead of continuing towards Yokohama/Motomachi-Chūkagai, change course at Hiyoshi for Tōkyū Shin-Yokohama Line and share all of the through services downstream just as Tōkyū Meguro Line.

==Stations==

There are a total of 180 unique stations (i.e., counting stations served by multiple lines only once) on the Tokyo Metro network. Most stations are located within the 23 special wards and fall inside the Yamanote Line rail loop — some wards such as Setagaya and Ōta have no stations (or only a limited number of stations), as rail service in these areas has historically been provided by the Toei Subway or any of the various .

Major interchange stations, connecting three or more Tokyo Metro lines, include the following:
* 
* 
* / 
* 

Other major stations provide additional connections to other railway operators such as the Toei Subway, JR East, and the various private railways, including (but not limited to) the following:

==Depots==
== Rolling stock ==

* 17000 series – Yūrakuchō Line, Fukutoshin Line
* 18000 series – Hanzōmon Line

Trains from other operators are also used on Tokyo Metro lines as a consequence of inter-running services.

==Overcrowding==

As is common with rail transport in Tokyo, Tokyo Metro trains are severely crowded during peak periods. During the morning peak period, platform attendants (oshiya) are sometimes needed to push riders and their belongings into train cars so that the doors can close. On some Tokyo Metro lines, the first or last car of a train is reserved for women during peak hours.

<doc id="390067" wikidata="Q833163" url="?curid=390067" title="Knight Bachelor">
<text>The title of Knight Bachelor is the basic rank granted to a man who has been knighted by the monarch but not inducted as a member of one of the organised orders of chivalry; it is a part of the British honours system.

Knights Bachelor are the most ancient sort of British knight (the rank existed during the 13th-century reign of King Henry III), but Knights Bachelor rank below knights of chivalric orders. A man who is knighted is formally addressed as &quot;Sir [First Name] [Surname]&quot; or &quot;Sir [First Name]&quot; and his wife as &quot;Lady [Surname]&quot;.

The designation &quot;Bachelor&quot; in this context conveys the concept of &quot;junior in rank&quot;.

==Criteria==
Knighthood is usually conferred for public service; amongst its recipients are all male judges of His Majesty&#x27;s High Court of Justice in England. It is possible to be a Knight Bachelor and a junior member of an order of chivalry without being a knight of that order; this situation has become rather common, especially among those recognized for achievements in entertainment. For instance, Sir Michael Gambon, Sir Mo Farah, Sir Derek Jacobi, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Sir Elton John, Sir Michael Caine, Sir Billy Connolly, Sir Barry Gibb and Sir Ian McKellen are Commanders of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE); Sir Patrick Stewart, Sir Cliff Richard, Sir Tom Jones and Sir Van Morrison are Officers of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE); while Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Richard Starkey (Ringo Starr), Sir Nick Faldo, and Sir Lewis Hamilton are Members of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE). None of them would be entitled to use the honorific &quot;Sir&quot; by virtue of their membership of the order alone, but as they are all also Knights Bachelor, they are entitled to preface their names with that title.

==Honorifics and post-nominal letters==
Knights Bachelor may prefix &quot;Sir&quot; to their forenames, and wives of Knights may prefix &quot;Lady&quot; to their surnames. The award originated in the Middle Ages. There are no post-nominal letters associated with the honour nor can it be awarded to women. (They are appointed Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire instead.)

==Insignia==

Until 1926, Knights Bachelor had no specific insignia which they could wear, but in that year, King George V issued a warrant authorising the wearing of a breast badge on all appropriate occasions by Knights Bachelor. This badge is worn on the left side of the coat or outer garment. Measuring in length and in width, it is described in heraldic terms as follows: 

Upon an oval medallion of vermilion, enclosed by a scroll a cross-hilted sword belted and sheathed, pommel upwards, between two spurs, rowels upwards, the whole set about with the sword belt, all gilt. 

In 1973, Queen Elizabeth II issued a further warrant authorising the wearing on appropriate occasions of a neck badge (of smaller size) and a miniature medal. In 1988, a new certificate of authentication, a Knight Bachelor&#x27;s only personal documentation, was designed by the College of Arms.

==Imperial society==
The Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor was founded for the maintenance and consolidation of the Dignity of Knights Bachelor in 1908, and obtained official recognition from the Sovereign in 1912. The Society keeps records of all Knights Bachelor, in their interest.

==Nonequivalence==
There is no female counterpart to Knight Bachelor. The lowest knightly honour that can be conferred upon a woman is Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (DBE), which is one rank higher than Knight Bachelor (being the female equivalent of KBE or Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, which is the next male knightly rank above Knight Bachelor). 

Only citizens of Commonwealth realms can be created Knights Bachelor; people of other nationalities are generally made honorary KBEs.

<doc id="390072" wikidata="Q5530374" url="?curid=390072" title="Gelatinous cube">
<text>A gelatinous cube is a fictional monster from the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game. It is described as a ten-foot cube of transparent gelatinous ooze, which is able to absorb and digest organic matter.

==Creative origins==
Oozes are relatively common antagonists in fantasy fiction; in addition to the oozes of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, examples include the monster from the film &quot;The Blob&quot; (1958), slime in &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, and flan in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. These fictional oozes may have been inspired by microscopic organisms such as amoebae, which, like oozes, can consume organic matter by engulfing it (phagocytosis).

The gelatinous cube is an original invention of Gary Gygax, rather than being inspired by outside sources and adapted to the roleplaying setting, as were many mythological monsters such as the minotaur and dryad, all of which appeared in the 1974 Monsters &amp; Treasure book of the original boxed set.

Being a cube that is a perfect ten feet on each side, it is specifically and perfectly &quot;adapted&quot; to its native environment, the standard, by dungeon corridors which were ubiquitous in the earliest &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; modules.

==Publication history==
The gelatinous cube first appeared in the original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;white box&quot; set (1974), and its first supplement, &quot;Greyhawk&quot; (1975).

The gelatinous cube appeared in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set&quot; (1977, 1981, 1983). The gelatinous cube also appeared in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia&quot; (1991).

The gelatinous cube appeared in first edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in the original &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (1977). The creature was further developed in &quot;Dragon&quot; #124 (August 1987). Published first edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventures which included gelatinous cubes as adversaries that the player characters encounter included &quot;The Ruins of Andril&quot;, published in &quot;Dragon&quot; #81.

The gelatinous cube appeared in second edition in &quot;Monstrous Compendium Volume One&quot; (1989), and the &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; (1993) under the &quot;ooze/slime/jelly&quot; heading. The gelatinous cube was featured on an &quot;AD&amp;D Trading Card&quot; in 1991.

Under the ooze entry, the gelatinous cube appears in the third edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2000), the 3.5 revised &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2003), the fourth edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2008), the &quot;Monster Vault&quot; (2010), and the fifth edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2014).

===Other publishers===
The gelatinous cube is fully detailed in Paizo Publishing&#x27;s book &quot;Dungeon Denizens Revisited&quot; (2009), on pages 16–21.

==Fictional ecology==
A gelatinous cube looks like a transparent ooze of mindless, gelatinous matter in the shape of a cube. The cube&#x27;s transparency coupled with a dimly-lit dungeon gives it the element of surprise to engulf unsuspecting beings, and only an alert adventurer will notice the cube. The cube slides through dungeon corridors, being able to mold its body to flow around objects and fit through narrow passages and then returning to its original shape once enough space is available. A cube will absorb everything in its path, with its acidic digestive juices dissolving everything organic and secreting non-digestible matter in its wake. David M. Ewalt, in his book &quot;Of Dice and Men&quot;, describes the gelatinous cube as &quot;a dungeon scavenger, a living mound of transparent jelly&quot;, &quot;The Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters&quot; called it a &quot;dungeon clean up crew&quot;, well adapted to this unique fictitious ecosystem.

==Reception==
Rob Bricken from io9 named the gelatinous cube as the 5th most memorable D&amp;D monster.

Chris Sims of the on-line magazine &quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; stated of the gelatinous cube that &quot;there can be no question of what is the greatest monster&quot; in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, calling the gelatinous cube &quot;amazing&quot;.

&quot;The Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters&quot; called the gelatinous cube one of the &quot;iconic monsters&quot; of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game.

Levi R. Bryant calls the gelatinous cube &quot;irksome and dangerous&quot;, &quot;populating many a dungeon&quot;.

==In other media==
*Gelatinous cubes have appeared in the television series &quot;Adventure Time&quot; by Pendleton Ward. They also appear in several video games, including &quot;NetHack&quot;, and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot;.
*A gelatinous cube appears in the 2017 episode &quot;The Serfsons&quot;, the season premiere of the twenty-ninth season of the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

*A gelatinous cube appears in the 2023 film &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves&quot;. The film&#x27;s release is accompanied by a Hasbro-produced action figure of such a cube in 1/12 (6-inch) scale.
*A gelatinous cube appears in the &quot;Saturday Morning Adventures&quot; limited comic series to the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; animated series.

<text>The , also known as , is a bureau of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government which operates public transport services in Tokyo. Among its services, the Toei Subway is one of two rapid transit systems which make up the Tokyo subway system, the other being Tokyo Metro.

==Toei Subway==
Toei Subway operates 4 rapid transit (subway) lines which complement the 9 lines operated by Tokyo Metro.

== Tokyo Sakura Tram ==

Tokyo Sakura Tram (the public name of the &quot;Toden Arakawa Line,&quot; the sole remaining line of Tokyo&#x27;s once-extensive streetcar system) is a 30-station hybrid light rail/tram line.

== Nippori-Toneri Liner ==
Nippori-Toneri Liner is a 13-station, long automated guideway transit system which commened operation on March 30, 2008.

== Ueno Zoo Monorail (Closed) ==

Ueno Zoo Monorail was a long suspended monorail inside the grounds of Ueno Zoo which commenced operation on December 17, 1957. Operation was suspended on October 31, 2019, and never recommenced with the line being officially closed on December 27, 2023.

==Bus lines==

Toei operates local bus service in central Tokyo, generally to fill in the gaps unserved by the Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway networks.

Most routes are designated by a &quot;kanji&quot; character followed by a two-digit route number. The initial character usually indicates the main railway station where the line terminates: for instance, (&quot;Shibu&quot; 66) is a suburban route from Shibuya Station. Some routes replace the initial character with Latin letters, one prominent example being the RH01 service between Roppongi Hills and Shibuya. Others use a special character derived from the route, such as (&quot;Niji&quot; [Rainbow] 01) which crosses the Rainbow Bridge. Some cross-town routes begin with the character (&quot;to&quot; &quot;metropolitan&quot;).

==Other services==
Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation also maintains a large fiber-optic cable network in the city, as well as several electric power generators.

==History==

===Establishment===

Tokyo City purchased the Tokyo Railway Company, a streetcar operator, in 1911, and placed its lines under the authority of the . The TMEB began bus service in 1924 as an emergency measure after the Great Kantō earthquake knocked out streetcar service in the city. (The TMEB was also responsible for providing electric power to Tokyo, but this service was privatized in 1942 as Tokyo Electric).

In 1942, the Japanese government forced a number of private transit businesses in Tokyo to merge into the TMEB. These included the bus lines of the Tokyo Underground Railway (whose Ginza Line remained independent), the Keio Electric Railway and the Tokyu Corporation, as well as the Oji Electric Tramway (operator of the Arakawa Line) and several smaller bus companies.

In 1943, Tokyo City was abolished and the TMEB&#x27;s operations were transferred to the new TMBT.

===Trolley buses===

TMBT operated electric trolley buses between 1952 and 1968 on four routes:

* Route 101: Imai - Kameido - Oshiage - Asakusa - Ueno
* Route 102: Ikebukuro - Shibuya - Naka-meguro - Gotanda - Shinagawa
* Route 103: Ikebukuro - Oji - San&#x27;ya - Kameido
* Route 104: Ikebukuro - Oji - Asakusa

The trolley buses were short-lived, however, mostly owing to their vulnerability to weather: rain caused problems with the overhead power supply, and snow required tire chains to be installed on vehicles in order to maintain traction.

<doc id="390080" wikidata="Q1769779" url="?curid=390080" title="Khadaffy Janjalani">
<text>Khadaffy Abubakar Janjalani (also transliterated as Khadafy Janjalani, Khadafi Janjalani and Khaddafi Janjalani; March 3, 1975 – September 4, 2006) was a Filipino Islamist militant who was the leader of the Moro militant group known as Abu Sayyaf and the leader of one of its factions. He was a staunch Wahhabi follower.

Janjalani was also known as Daf or Pek. He was a citizen of the Philippines, of Tau Sūg and Ilonggo parentage, and spoke both Tausug and Tagalog, as well as some Arabic. According to the FBI, he was quiet, reserved, indecisive and overconfident.

Janjalani was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for his alleged involvement in terrorist acts, including hostage kidnapping and murder, against United States nationals and other foreign nationals in and around the Republic of the Philippines. Janjalani allegedly served as the Amir or spiritual leader of Abu Sayyaf Group, which allegedly took the foreign nationals hostage.

For that indictment, on February 24, 2006, Janjalani was among six fugitives in the second and most recent group of indicted fugitives to be added to the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list along with two fellow members of Abu Sayyaf.

The United States government offered a 5 million US Dollar (216,000,000 PHP) reward for Janjalani&#x27;s capture.

On December 27, 2006, the Philippine military reported that what appeared to be Janjalani&#x27;s remains had been recovered near Patikul, on Sulu Island in the southern Philippines, and that DNA tests had been ordered to confirm the discovery. As related by fellow fighters taken prisoner, he was shot in the neck in an encounter with government troops in September on Luba Hills, Patikul town, Sulu Island. On January 20, 2007, Military Chief General Hermogenes Esperon Jr. announced the identity of the corpse was confirmed, through a DNA comparison with a brother of the militant conducted by the American FBI.

==Background on Basilan birthplace==

Khadafi Abubakar Janjalani was born in 1975 in Isabela City, currently one of the smallest 4th income class cities of the Philippines. Located on the north of the island of Basilan, Isabela is also the capital of Basilan province, across the Basilan Strait from Zamboanga City. But Isabela City is administered under the Zamboanga Peninsula political region north of the island of Basilan, while the rest of the island province of Basilan is now (since 1996) governed as part of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) to the east.

Consequently, being on the social or political division line, Isabela City and Basilan island have seen some of the fiercest fighting between government troops and the Muslim separatist group Abu Sayyaf through the early 2000s.

Before Khadafi Janjalani was born, in the early 1970s, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) was the main Muslim rebel group fighting in the Basilan region of the southern Philippines.

In the late 70s, Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani, Khadaffy Janjalani&#x27;s older brother, was a former teacher from Basilan, who had studied theology and Arabic in Libya, Syria and Saudi Arabia. Abdurajik then became a veteran of the war against the Soviet Union during the Soviet–Afghan War. During that time, he allegedly met Osama bin Laden, and was given $6 million to establish his own offshoot group in the southern Philippines, out of members of the extant MNLF.

By then, as a political solution in the southern Philippines, ARMM had been created, in 1989, when the younger Janjalani was thirteen years old, growing up on Basilan.

==Abu Sayyaf Group under Abdurajik Janjalani==
His older brother Abdurajik then returned home to Basilan island in 1990, where he gathered radical members of the old MNLF, to found Abu Sayyaf Group. It was named after his own alias, which was &quot;Abu Sayyaf&quot;. MNLF had moderated into an established political party, which eventually became the ruling party of the ARMM, by its full institutionalization in 1996 on the southern Philippines island of Mindanao.

Meanwhile, Abu Sayyaf Group had started out on their own by 1991 under the leadership of the elder Janjalani brother, Abdurajik. By 1995 they had been active in large scale bombings and attacks in the Philippines, and also had become associated with Ramzi Yousef (of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 1994 Philippine Airlines Flight 434 bombing, and the foiled 1995 Operation Bojinka), and also with Jemaah Islamiyah (al-Qaeda&#x27;s southeast Asia associated branch led by Hambali). At some point in the early 1990s, the younger brother Khadaffy Janjalani had also joined Abu Sayyaf, as a teenager, and was eventually imprisoned by the Philippines government.

In 1995, 20-year-old Khadaffy Janjalani escaped from Camp Crame in Manila along with another member named Jovenal Bruno.

On December 18, 1998, the older brother Abdurajik Janjalani was killed in a firefight with the Philippine National Police on Basilan island. He is thought to have been about age 39 at the time of his death.

==Abu Sayyaf Group under Khadaffy Janjalani==
The 23-year-old Khadaffy Janjalani then took power of one of Abu Sayyaf&#x27;s factions in an internecine struggle. He then worked to consolidate his power within Abu Sayyaf, causing the group to appear inactive for a period. After Janjalani&#x27;s supremacy was secured, Abu Sayyaf began a new tactic, as they proceeded to take hostages.

The group&#x27;s motive for kidnapping became more financial and less religious during the period of Khadaffy&#x27;s leadership, according to locals in the areas associated with Abu Sayyaf. The hostage money is probably the method of financing of the group.

Khadaffy Janjalani was indicted in the United States for his alleged involvement in terrorist acts, including hostage taking by Abu Sayyaf and murder, against United States nationals and other foreign nationals in and around the Republic of the Philippines.

Consequently, on February 24, 2006, Janjalani was among six fugitives in the second and most recent group of indicted fugitives to be added to the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list along with two fellow members of Abu Sayyaf, Isnilon Totoni Hapilon and Jainal Antel Sali, Jr.

Janjalani&#x27;s aliases include Khadafi Abubakar Janjalam, Khaddafy Abubakar Janjalani, Abu Muktar, Amir Khadafi Abubaker Janjalani, Khadafi Abu Muktar, Jimar Manalad Montanio, Khadafi Montanio, Abu Mochtar (&quot;The good-hearted&quot;), &quot;Daf&quot;, and Omar Bin Salik.

==Death==
News organizations in the Philippines came out with reports on December 26, 2006, about a body being dug-up in the area where Janjalani was known to be at large. On January 20, 2007, DNA test results came back confirming the body was his. Despite these results, his family believes that he is still alive and in hiding. In June 2007, the Rewards for Justice Program awarded the Philippines with 5 Million $ for information leading to his death.

<text>The Battle of Dara was fought between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sasanians in 530 AD. It was one of the battles of the Iberian War.

Procopius&#x27;s account of this engagement is among the most detailed descriptions of a late Roman battle.

==Background==

The Byzantine Empire was at war with the Sasanians from 527, supposedly because Kavadh I had tried to force the Iberians to become Zoroastrians. The Iberian king fled from Kavadh, but Kavadh tried to make peace with the Byzantines, and attempted to have Justin I adopt his son Khosrau. Justin agreed, but on the terms that he would do so only in a rite reserved for barbarians. This failed to satisfy Kavadh, who attacked Byzantine allies, so Justin sent his generals Sittas and Belisarius into Persia, where they were initially defeated. In 529, the failed negotiations of Justin&#x27;s successor Justinian prompted a Sasanian expedition of 40,000 men towards Dara. The next year, Belisarius was sent back to the region alongside Hermogenes and an army; Kavadh answered with another 10,000 troops under the general Perozes, who set up camp about five kilometers away at Ammodius, in the near vicinity of Dara.

==Deployment==
The Persians, outnumbering the Romans by 15,000 men, deployed around 20 stades away from the town of Daras and drew up their battle lines.
Despite being outnumbered, Belisarius decided to give battle. He dug a number of ditches to block the Persian cavalry, leaving gaps between them to allow a counterattack. According to Irfan Shahid, the tactic was adopted from the Persians at the Battle of Thannuris two years earlier. These were pushed forward on either flank of his position, while his center was refused back. Here he placed his unreliable infantry behind the center ditch, being placed close enough to the walls of the fortress to provide supporting fire from the city battlements. On the left and right flanks were the Byzantine cavalry, of questionable quality. Supporting them on their interior flanks were small bodies of Huns: 300 Hun cavalry under Sunicas and Aigan supporting the left; and as many more Huns on the right under Simmas and Ascan. Belisarius also placed a body of Heruli cavalry under Pharas in ambush position off his left flank. A reserve composed of his own &quot;bucellarii&quot; household cavalry was held behind his center and commanded by John the Armenian, his trusted lieutenant and boyhood friend.

==Battle==
On the first day, according to Procopius, there was no general engagement, but instead a series of challenge fights between champions of both sides. One particular combat involved a Persian knight, who challenged Belisarius to single combat; but was instead met by a Byzantine bath slave named Andreas. Andreas, who had been secretly training with Belisarius&#x27; own household troopers, killed not only this Persian champion, but also a second challenger later in the day. The Persians then withdrew to Ammodius for the night. Some authors, however, have expressed doubt as to the pure historicity of Procopius&#x27; account and state that while instances of single combat did likely occur during the course of the battle, Procopius&#x27; description is intended to be a narrative device rather than a factual account. Another source, believed to be based on official documents, does indeed reference individual combat, but makes no mention of Andreas and, furthermore, places any single combat engagements at a different stage of the battle.

After the first day of skirmishes, Belisarius sent a letter to the Persian commander. Rather than fight a battle, he believed it was best to avoid conflict and instead insisted that their disputes be settled by discussion. The letter read, &quot;The first blessing is peace, as is agreed by all men who have even a small share of reason. ... The best general, therefore, is that one which is able to bring about peace from war.&quot; The letter either fell on deaf ears or Perozes already wanted to negotiate which eventually failed, the battle resumed. The Persians already thought of the Byzantine army as a second-rate army; this letter, along with his numerical superiority, likely made Perozes even more confident of victory. In his book on Belisarius, Brogna merely says that Belisarius sent the letter because of his good moral character. Mahon claims in his book that Belisarius doubted his chance of victory and this is why he sent the letter.

On the second day of the battle, 10,000 more Persian troops arrived from Nisibis. The Sassanid and Byzantine light infantry exchanged fire resulting in minor casualties on each side. As Procopius describes, &quot;At first, then, both sides discharged arrows against each other, and the missiles by their great number made, as it were, a vast cloud; and many men were falling on both sides, but the missiles of the barbarians flew much more thickly. For fresh men were always fighting in turn, affording to their enemy not the slightest opportunity to observe what was being done; but even so the Romans did not have the worst of it. For a steady wind blew from their side against the barbarians, and checked to a considerable degree the force of their arrows.&quot; Depending on the source, either the Persians got the best of the Romans, the fight was fairly equal or the Persians suffered more. Then the Persians formed two lines: the right flank under Pityaxes and the left under Baresmanas.

At this time of the day the temperature of the region has been estimated to have been particularly hot, probably around .

The first wave of the Persian attack was directed against the Byzantine left flank. The Persians forced a crossing of the ditch, pushing back the Byzantine cavalry. But the intervention of Sunicas&#x27; Huns attacking from the interior of the Byzantine line, as well as Pharas&#x27; Herulians attacking out of ambush from the opposite side, forced the Persians&#x27; wing to retreat.

The Persians then attacked the Byzantine right wing, where Perozes sent the Sassanid Zhayedan, also known as the Immortals, who were the elite Persian armored lancers. The Byzantine cavalry and infantry defending the ditch were pushed back here as they had been on the left. But Belisarius counterattacked with his reserve Bucellari cavalry, and split the Persian troops in two. Half the Persians pursued the Byzantine cavalry, but the rest were trapped, and Baresmanas was killed along with 5,000 other men. The Byzantine cavalry also recovered and routed their pursuers. Belisarius allowed a pursuit for a few miles, but let the majority of Persian survivors escape.

==Aftermath==
Following the defeat, the Sasanians under &quot;Spahbod&quot; Azarethes together with their client Lakhmids started another invasion, this time, unexpectedly, via Commagene. Belisarius foiled their plan by swift maneuvering and forced the Persians, who were retreating, into a heavy battle at Callinicum in which the Byzantines were defeated, but with heavy casualties on both sides. The Byzantines eventually paid tributes in exchange for a peace treaty.

In 540 and 544 Dara was attacked by Khosrau I, who was unable to take it either time. Khosrau finally captured it in 573; its fall was said to have caused Justin II to go insane. Justin&#x27;s wife Sophia and his friend Tiberius Constantine took control of the empire until Justin died in 578. Meanwhile, the Persians were able to march further into the empire, but Khosrau died in 579.

Maurice defeated the Persians at Dara in 586 and recaptured the fortress, but the Persians under Khosrau II defeated the Byzantines in 604. This time, the Persians destroyed the city, but the Byzantines later rebuilt it in 628. In 639 the Muslim Arabs captured it, and it remained in their hands until 942 when it was sacked by the Byzantines. It was sacked again by John I Tzimiskes in 958, but the Byzantines never recaptured it.

<text>The Tasman Peninsula, officially Turrakana / Tasman Peninsula, is a peninsula located in south-east Tasmania, Australia, approximately by the Arthur Highway, south-east of Hobart.

The Tasman Peninsula lies south and west of Forestier Peninsula, to which it connects via an isthmus called Eaglehawk Neck. This in turn is joined to the rest of Tasmania by an isthmus called East Bay Neck, near the town of Dunalley, approximately by road from Hobart. The peninsula is surrounded by water; to the north by Norfolk Bay, to the northwest by Frederick Henry Bay, to the west and south by Storm Bay, and to the east by the Tasman Sea.

==Description==
Many smaller towns are also located on the Tasman Peninsula, the largest of which are Nubeena and Koonya. Smaller centres include Premaydena, Highcroft and Stormlea. The Conservation Park, located on the main highway at Taranna, is a popular local visitor attraction along with the World Heritage Port Arthur Historic Site and a number of beaches.

The local government area is the Tasman Council. The area of the peninsula and of the local government area is .

==History==
The original name for the area is Turrakana. The Aboriginal inhabitants of this area preceding European arrival were the Pydairrerme people. Their territory was what is now known as the Tasman and Forestier peninsulas. The Pydairrerme people were a part of the larger Paredarerme language group, whose territory covered a large area of the east coast of Tasmania. The area was named after Dutch explorer Abel Tasman after colonisation but was dual named as of March 2021.

The first European settlement of the peninsula was in the early 1830s. It was selected as a penal settlement because it was geographically isolated from the rest of the colony but more easily reachable by sea than the other place of secondary banishment, Macquarie Harbour on the west coast, which could then be closed down. It also had excellent supplies of timber for shipbuilding and general construction work, and a deep sheltered harbour where visiting British warships could be repaired. Its inaccessibility was enhanced by having Eaglehawk Neck lined with guards and guard dogs, to prevent the escape of any convicts. A small number did escape, including the bushranger Martin Cash.

The Coal Mines Historic Site, located near the north tip west of the peninsula, was originally the site of a convict-operated coal mine.

The penal settlement of Port Arthur is now a tourist attraction. As in most of the rest of the state, tourism is a major industry. Bushwalking is also popular in the often rugged terrain, particularly picturesque spots being Cape Raoul and Cape Pillar at the extreme south-west and south-east ends of the peninsula, separated by the entrance to Port Arthur.

===Local industry===
In the era between the convict settlement and the rise of the modern tourist industry, people in the area were mostly engaged in the timber industry and fishing. The terrain and soil types impeded large-scale agriculture, although orcharding and general farming was and is conducted in suitable locations. The region remained highly isolated until the introduction of regular river steamer services between it and Hobart in the 1880s - they were further encouraged by the tourist industry to Port Arthur that began when overseas steamships began to call into Hobart, also during the 1880s. During the period 1900-1930s, the main operator servicing the area was the Huon Channel &amp; Peninsula Steamship Company, owners of several vessels including the extant &quot;MV Cartela&quot;.

==Environment==
===Plants===
The rare Cape Pillar sheoak is a shrub or small tree found only in the Tasman National Park where it is restricted to the Cape Pillar area of the Tasman Peninsula and to Tasman Island.

===Birds===
The peninsula forms part of the South-east Tasmania Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance in the conservation of a range of woodland birds, especially the endangered swift parrot and forty-spotted pardalote.

===Tasmanian devil===
While the region is best known for its convict history it is now the key area in the battle to save the Tasmanian devil from extinction from a new type of contagious cancer called devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). The isolation from the Tasmanian mainland, where DFTD is running unchecked and has killed more than half of all devils, is ideal for maintaining a healthy wild Tasmanian devil population in a project that involves the local Tasmanian Devil Conservation Park at Taranna and government and university scientists.

===Coastline===
The rugged coastline has been the scene of a number of shipwrecks. Two large seagoing steamers have sunk after hitting the Hippolyte Rocks off its east coast - the &quot;Tasman&quot; in 1883 and the &quot;Nord&quot; in 1915. Munroe Bight to the north of Cape Pillar is named after the former American barque &quot;James Munroe&quot; wrecked there in 1850.

The Tasman Peninsula is well known for its rugged eastern coastline, and much of it is now the Tasman National Park. At Eaglehawk Neck are many strange rock formations, including The Devils Kitchen, Tasman&#x27;s Arch, Blow Hole and the Tessellated Pavement. Further south are the highest sea cliffs in the Southern Hemisphere, rising above the Tasman Sea at Cape Pillar.

The peninsula has notable surf spots at Cape Raoul, Roaring Beach and Shipstern Bluff.

A historical survey map is available which outlines the geology and vegetation of the Tasman Peninsula, Forestier Peninsula and south east from the Coal River.

<text>Publius Valerius Laevinus was commander of the Roman forces at the Battle of Heraclea in 280 BC, in which he was defeated by Pyrrhus of Epirus. In his &quot;Life of Pyrrhus&quot;, Plutarch wrote that Gaius Fabricius Luscinus said of this battle that it was not the Epirots who had beaten the Romans, but only Pyrrhus who had beaten Laevinus. 

Laevinus was consul, along with Tiberius Coruncanius, in 280 BC.

<doc id="390099" wikidata="Q982354" url="?curid=390099" title="Olavo Bilac">
<text>Olavo Brás Martins dos Guimarães Bilac (16 December 1865 – 28 December 1918), known simply as Olavo Bilac (), was a Brazilian Parnassian poet, journalist and translator. Alongside Alberto de Oliveira and Raimundo Correia, he was a member of the &quot;Parnassian Triad&quot;. He was elected the &quot;Prince of Brazilian Poets&quot; in 1907 by the magazine &quot;Fon-Fon&quot;. He wrote the lyrics of the Brazilian Flag Anthem.

He founded and occupied the 15th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters from 1897 until his death in 1918. He is also the patron of the military service in Brazil due to his campaigns in favor of conscription.

==Life==
Bilac was born in Rio de Janeiro to Brás Martins dos Guimarães Bilac and Delfina Belmira Gomes de Paula. As a young man, he was a brilliant student, enrolling in the school of medicine at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro at the age of 15.

He began studying medicine, but did not finish the course. He also tried to study law at the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo but did not finish that course either. Instead, he found pleasure in writing and in journalism.

His first work was the sonnet &quot;Sesta de Nero&quot; (&quot;Nero&#x27;s Nap&quot;) in the newspaper &quot;Gazeta de Notícias&quot; in 1884, which received praise from Artur Azevedo.

In addition to poetry, Bilac wrote publicity texts, chronicles, schoolbooks, children&#x27;s poetry and satirical works. In 1891, he was arrested at the Fortaleza da Laje in Rio de Janeiro for opposing the government of Floriano Peixoto.

In 1897, Bilac lost control of his car, crashing it into a tree. He was the first person to suffer a car accident in Brazil.

Bilac never married and never had children. He was engaged to Amélia de Oliveira, the sister of the poet Alberto de Oliveira, but their engagement was short-lived since it was opposed by another brother of Amélia, who said Bilac had no future. He had an even shorter engagement to Maria Selika, daughter of violinist Francisco Pereira da Costa, but a legend says that Amélia was very faithful to Bilac: she never married, and, when Bilac died, she put a lock of her hair in his coffin.

Bilac died in 1918. His last words were, &quot;Give me coffee! I&#x27;m going to write!&quot;

<doc id="390102" wikidata="Q335460" url="?curid=390102" title="Ibn al-Khattab">
<text>Samir Saleh Abdullah al-Suwailim (; 14 April 1969 – 20 March 2002), commonly known as Ibn al-Khattab or Emir Khattab, was a Saudi Arabian pan-Islamist militant. Though he fought in many conflicts, he is best known for his involvement in the First and Second Chechen War, which he participated in after moving to Chechnya at the invitation of the Akhmadov brothers.

The origins and real identity of Khattab remained a mystery to most until after his death, when his brother gave an interview to the press. His death in 2002 had followed his exposure to a poisoned letter, which had been delivered to him by a personal courier who was secretly recruited by the Federal Security Service (FSB) of the Russian Federation.

According to American scholar Muhammad al-Ubaydi who specializes in the study of militant Islam, his continued relevance is due to the fact that he was the internationalist Salafi jihadist fighter par excellence: he was born in Saudi Arabia and had taken part in conflicts in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Chechnya, Dagestan, and Tajikistan, and who in addition to his native Arabic was able to communicate in English, Kurdish, Pashto, Persian, and Russian. Compounding this was his charismatic appealing approach towards attracting non-Arab Muslims to fight for his cause and his pioneering use of modern media dissemination techniques to promote jihad, particularly by way of publishing military videos for propaganda purposes.

==Early life and education==
Khattab&#x27;s background is a topic of debate, with some sources placing his year of birth as 1963 in Jordan as well as his birth name being Habib Abd al-Rahman Ibn al-Khattab, to a family of Jordanian-Circassian origin. Another claim says Khattab was born in 1969 as Samir bin Salah al-Suwailim in Arar, Saudi Arabia, to a Bedouin father of the Arab Suwaylim tribe, also found in Jordan, and a mother of Syrian Turkmen descent. Regardless of the claims, Khattab self-identified as an Arab and later identified with both Saudi Arabia and Jordan as his countries.

He was described as a brilliant student, scoring 94 percent in the secondary school examination, and initially wanted to continue his higher studies in the United States, even if he was already fond of Islamic periodicals and tapes as opposed to his siblings, to the extent they renamed him after the second caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab. He would retain the title during his militant activities, which began in 1987, by joining the Afghan Arabs against the Afghan Government Forces and the Soviet Army.

== Career ==

===Afghanistan===
At the age of 17, Khattab left Saudi Arabia to participate in the fight against forces of the Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union during the Soviet–Afghan War and the following Afghan Civil War. During this time, he lost the majority of his right hand after an accident with IEDs. He never visited the hospital, and he healed it by himself using honey, as per the Prophetic medicine. He would participate in the botched Battle of Jalalabad in 1989.

Khattab, while the leader of Islamic International Brigade, publicly admitted that he spent the period between 1989 and 1994 in Afghanistan and that he had met Osama bin Laden and Zawahiri. In March 1994, Khattab arrived in Afghanistan and toured fighter training camps in Khost province. He returned to Afghanistan with the first group of Chechen militants in May 1994. Khattab underwent training in Afghanistan and had close connections with al-Qaeda. Several hundred Chechens eventually trained in al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.

=== Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Bosnia–Herzegovina ===
Armenian sources claim that in 1992 he was one of many Chechen volunteers who aided Azerbaijan in the embattled region of Nagorno-Karabakh, where he allegedly met Shamil Basayev. However, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense denied any involvement by Khattab in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War.

From 1993 to 1995, Khattab left to fight alongside Islamic opposition in the Tajikistan Civil War. Before leaving for Tajikistan in 1994, al-Khattab gave Abdulkareem Khadr a pet rabbit of his own, which was promptly named Khattab.

In an interview, Khattab once mentioned he had also been involved in the Bosnian War. The fragment of this interview in which he makes this statement can be found in the 2004 BBC documentary &quot;The Smell of Paradise&quot;, though he did not specify his exact role or the duration of his presence there.

===Russia===

==== First Chechen War ====
According to Khattab&#x27;s brother, he first heard about the Chechen conflict on an Afghan television channel in 1995; that same year, he entered Chechnya, posing as a television reporter. He was credited as being a pioneer in producing video footage of Chechen rebel combat operations in order to aid fundraising efforts as well as international recruitment, and he himself achieved notoriety in 1996 when he himself filmed an ambush he led against a Russian armored column in Shatoy. Not long after his arrival he married an ethnic Lak woman from Dagestan, the sister of Nadyr Khachiliev, an Islamist and leader of the Union of the Muslims of Russia, which has been seen as a way to already internationalize the Chechen struggle.

During the First Chechen War, Khattab participated in fighting Russian federal forces and acted as an intermediary financier between foreign Muslim funding sources and the local fighters. To help secure funding and spread the message of resistance, he was frequently accompanied by at least one cameraman.

His units were credited with several devastating ambushes on Russian columns in the Chechen mountains. His first action was the October 1995 ambush of a Russian convoy which killed 47 soldiers. Khattab gained early fame and a great notoriety in Russia for his April 1996 ambush of a large armored column in a narrow gorge of Yaryshmardy, near Shatoy, which killed up to 100 soldiers and destroyed some two or three dozen vehicles. In another ambush, near Vedeno, at least 28 Russian troops were killed.

In 1996 on the order from Aslan Maskhadov President of Chechnya, Khattab was appointed as the Chief of Military Training Center of the Central Front of the ChRI Armed Forces.

In the course of the war, Shamil Basayev became his closest ally and personal friend. He was also associated with Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, who gave Khattab two of the highest Chechen military awards, the Order of Honor and the Brave Warrior medal, and promoted him to the rank of general in 1997.

A senior Chechen commander by the name of Izmailov told press how Khattab urged restraint, citing the Quran, when at the end of the war the Chechens wanted to shoot those they considered traitors.

==== Activity in the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria ====
After the conclusion of the war, Khattab, by then wanted by Interpol on Russia&#x27;s request, became a prominent warlord and commanded the Chechen Mujahideen, his own private army with a group of Arabs, Turks, Chechens, Kurds, and other foreign fighters who had come to participate in the war. He set up a network of paramilitary camps in the mountainous parts of the republic that trained not only Chechens, but also Muslims from the North Caucasian Russian republics and Central Asia.

On 22 December 1997, over a year after the signing of the Khasav-Yurt treaty and the end of the first war in Chechnya, the mujahideen and a group of Dagestani rebels raided the base of the 136th Armoured Brigade of the 58th Division of the Russian Army in Buinaksk, Dagestan.

==== War in Dagestan ====
In 1998, along with Shamil Basayev, Khattab created or reorganized the Mazhlis ul Shura of the United Mujahids (Consultative Council of United Holy Warriors), the Congress of the Peoples of Dagestan and Ichkeriya, the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment (SPIR), the Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade (IIPB) (also known as the Islamic Peacekeeping Army) and a group of female suicide bombers, the Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Shahids. In August–September 1999, they led the IIPB&#x27;s incursions into Dagestan, which resulted in the deaths of at least several hundred people and effectively started the Second Chechen War.

==== 1999 Russian apartment bombings ====
A Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) investigation named Khattab as the mastermind behind the September 1999 Russian apartment bombings. However, on 14 September 1999, Khattab told the Russian Interfax news agency in Grozny that he had nothing to do with the Moscow explosions; he was quoted as saying, &quot;We would not like to be akin to those who kill sleeping civilians with bombs and shells.&quot;

Some journalists and historians, both western and Russian, have claimed that the bombings were in fact a &quot;false flag&quot; attack perpetrated by the FSB in order to legitimize the resumption of military activities in Chechnya. Among them are Johns Hopkins University scholar David Satter, historians Yuri Felshtinsky, Amy Knight and Karen Dawisha, and former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko who was believed to be poisoned by Russian agents in London.

However, the invasion of Dagestan in August 1999 was the first and the main casus belli for the Second Chechen War.

==== Second Chechen War ====
During the course of the war in 2000, Khattab took over the leadership of the Chechen Mujahideen and participated in leading his militia against Russian forces in Chechnya, as well as managing the influx of foreign fighters and money and also planning of attacks in Russia.

He led or commanded several devastating attacks during this year, such as the mountain battle, which killed at least 67 Russian paratroopers, and the attack on the OMON convoy near Zhani-Vedeno, which killed at least 3 Russian Interior Ministry troops. During the war, he produced the &quot;Russian Hell&quot; video, which showcases the torture and execution of Russian soldiers and would later become popular among Islamist militants internationally.

Khattab later survived a heavy-calibre bullet wound to the stomach and a landmine explosion.

== Death and legacy ==
Khattab died of poisoning on 20 March 2002, when a Dagestani messenger hired by the Russian FSB gave Khattab a poisoned letter the day before. Chechen sources said that the letter was coated with &quot;a fast-acting nerve agent, possibly sarin or a derivative&quot;. The messenger, a Dagestani double agent known as Ibragim Alauri, was turned by the FSB on his routine courier mission. Khattab would receive letters from his mother in Saudi Arabia, and the FSB found this to be the most opportune moment to kill Khattab. It was reported that the operation to recruit and turn Ibragim Alauri to work for the FSB and deliver the poisoned letter took some six months of preparation. Alauri was reportedly tracked down and killed a month later in Baku, Azerbaijan on Shamil Basayev&#x27;s orders. Ibn Al-Khattab was succeeded by Emir Abu al-Walid.

He was falsely reported dead when Omar Mohammed Ali Al-Rammah, a Yemeni prisoner at Guantanamo Bay, faced the allegations that he witnessed Khattab being killed in an ambush in Duisi, a village in the Pankisi Gorge of Georgia on 28 April 2002.

&quot;Khattabka&quot; (хаттабка) is now a popular Russian and Chechen name for an improvised hand grenade, made from either VOG-17 or VOG-25 grenade.

Due to his fierce opposition and devotion against Russia, he was nicknamed the Lion of Chechnya.

=== Relationship with Osama bin Laden ===
According to Fawaz Gerges who cited Saif al-Adel and Abu Walid al Masri&#x27;s diaries, Ibn al-Khattab and Osama bin Laden operated separate groups, as they defined the enemy differently, but tried to pull each other to their own battle plans. A part of bin Laden&#x27;s interest was trying to obtain weapons of mass destruction (or at least dirty bombs) from the Russian arsenal through al-Khattab&#x27;s contacts.

According to Richard A. Clarke, &quot;Bin Laden sent Afghan Arab veterans, money, and arms to fellow Saudi Ibn Khatab in Chechnya, which seemed like a perfect theater for jihad.&quot;

<text>Agnes Elisabeth Lutyens, CBE (9 July 190614 April 1983) was an English composer.

== Early life and education ==
Elisabeth Lutyens was born in London on 9 July 1906. She was one of the five children of Lady Emily Bulwer-Lytton (1874–1964), a member of the aristocratic Bulwer-Lytton family, and the prominent English architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. Elisabeth was the elder sister of the writer Mary Lutyens and aunt of the 4th Viscount Ridley and the politician Nicholas Ridley.

Lutyens was involved in the Theosophical Movement. From 1911 the young Jiddu Krishnamurti was living in the Lutyens&#x27; London house as a friend of Elisabeth and her sisters. At the age of nine she began to aspire to be a composer. In 1922, Lutyens pursued her musical education in Paris at the École Normale de Musique, which had been established a few years previously, living with the young theosophical composer Marcelle de Manziarly, who had been trained by Nadia Boulanger. During her months in Paris Lutyens showed first signs of depression that later led to several mental breakdowns.

She accompanied her mother to India in 1923. On her return to Europe she studied with John Foulds and subsequently continued her musical education from 1926 to 1930 at the Royal College of Music in London as a pupil of Harold Darke.

==Family life==
In 1933, Lutyens married baritone Ian Glennie; they had twin daughters, Rose and Tess, and a son, Sebastian. The marriage was not happy, however, and in 1938 she left Glennie. They divorced in 1940.

She then became the partner of Edward Clark, a conductor and former BBC producer who had studied with Schoenberg. Clark and Lutyens had a son, Conrad, in 1941 and married on 9 May 1942. She composed in complete isolation, a process greatly impeded by the drinking and partying at the Clark flat, and the responsibilities of motherhood.

In 1946, pressured by Edward Clark and her mother, she decided to abort her fifth child. Two years later, she had a mental and physical breakdown that forced her to spend several months in a mental health institution. It was not until 1951 that she managed to regain control of her alcohol addiction, having endured days of extreme withdrawal.

Lutyens was interviewed, in June 1975, by the historian, Brian Harrison, as part of the Suffrage Interviews project, titled &quot;Oral evidence on the suffragette and suffragist movements: the Brian Harrison interviews.&quot; She reflected on theosophy and its influence on women’s suffrage, lesbianism in the suffrage movement and Edwardian attitudes towards sex and contraception, as well as her mother’s family relationships, including with Lady Constance Lytton.  

==Career==
=== Works ===
In 1945, William Walton was able to repay the service Clark had rendered him in relation to the premiere of his Viola Concerto in 1929. Lutyens approached Walton for an introduction to Muir Mathieson with a view to getting some film music work. He readily agreed to pass on her name, but he went a step further: He invited her to write any work she liked, then dedicate it to him, and he would pay her £100 sight unseen. The work she wrote was &quot;The Pit&quot;. Edward Clark conducted &quot;The Pit&quot; at the 1946 ISCM Festival in London, along with her &quot;Three Symphonic Preludes&quot;.

She found success in 1947 with a cantata setting Arthur Rimbaud&#x27;s poem &quot;Ô saisons, Ô châteaux&quot;. The BBC refused to perform it at the time because the soprano range was thought to go beyond the bounds of the possible, but the BBC was nevertheless the organisation that gave first performances to many of her works from the 1940s to the 1950s. Her work in this period included incidental music for a number of poetry readings, such as Esmé Hooton&#x27;s &quot;Zoo&quot; in 1956. The BBC began playing her music again when her friend William Glock became Director of Music. Lutyens is remembered for her intolerance of her better-known contemporaries among English composers including Vaughan Williams, Holst, Ireland and Bax. She dismissed them as &quot;the cowpat school&quot; in a lecture she gave at the Dartington International Summer School in the 1950s, disparaging their &quot;folky‐wolky melodies on the cor anglais&quot;.

Edward Clark had resigned from the BBC in 1936 amid much ill-feeling. He was still doing contract work for the BBC as well as freelance conducting, but those opportunities dried up and he was essentially unemployed from 1939 until his death in 1962. He was involved with the ISCM and other contemporary music promotional organisations, but always in an unpaid capacity. Lutyens paid the bills by composing film scores for Hammer&#x27;s horror movies and also for their rivals Amicus Productions. She was the first female British composer to score a feature film, her first foray into the genre being &quot;Penny and the Pownall Case&quot; (1948). Her other scores included &quot;Never Take Sweets from a Stranger&quot; (1960), &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother to Knock&quot; (1961), &quot;Paranoiac&quot; (1963), &quot;Dr. Terror&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; (1965), &quot;The Earth Dies Screaming&quot; (1965), &quot;The Skull&quot; (1965) (a suite from this was issued on CD in 2004), &quot;Spaceflight IC-1&quot; (1965), &quot;The Psychopath&quot; (1966), &quot;Theatre of Death&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Terrornauts&quot; (1967). Lutyens did not regard her film scores as highly as her concert works, but she still relished being referred to as the &quot;Horror Queen&quot;, which went well with the green nail polish she habitually wore. She also wrote music for many documentary films and for BBC radio and TV programmes, as well as incidental music for the stage.

By the late 1960s her music was in greater favour and she received a number of important commissions, including &quot;Quincunx&quot; for orchestra with soprano and baritone soloists (1959–60), which was premiered at the 1962 Cheltenham Music Festival and uses a quartet of Wagner tubas in the orchestra. The work was well received and recorded at the time, but didn&#x27;t receive a live performance in London until 1999. Her &quot;Symphonies for solo piano, wind, harps and percussion&quot; was a commission for the 1961 Promenade Concerts. In 1969 she was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). &quot;And Suddenly It’s Evening&quot; (1966) for tenor and ensemble, setting a translation of words by Salvatore Quasimodo, was commissioned by the BBC in 1967 and performed at the Proms in 1967, 1974 and 1976.

===Writing===
Her autobiography &quot;A Goldfish Bowl&quot;, describing life as a female musician in London, was published in 1972. She once said that she hated writing the book and only did so to record her husband Edward Clark&#x27;s earlier achievements.

===Death===
Elisabeth Lutyens died in London in 1983, aged 76.

<doc id="390109" wikidata="Q801551" url="?curid=390109" title="Ueno Station">
<text>is a major railway station in Tokyo&#x27;s Taitō ward. It is the station used to reach the Ueno district and Ueno Park—which contains Tokyo National Museum, The National Museum of Western Art, Ueno Zoo, Tokyo University of the Arts and other famous cultural facilities. A major commuter hub, it is also the traditional terminus for long-distance trains from northern Japan, although with the extension of the Shinkansen lines to Tokyo Station this role has diminished in recent years. A similar extension of conventional lines extended Takasaki Line, Utsunomiya Line and Jōban Line services to Tokyo Station via the Ueno-Tokyo Line in March 2015, using existing little-used tracks and a new viaduct; the Ueno-Tokyo Line connects these lines with the Tōkaidō Main Line, allowing through services to Shinagawa, Yokohama, Odawara and Atami stations.

Ueno Station is close to Keisei Ueno Station, the Tokyo terminus of the Keisei Main Line to Narita Airport Station.

==Lines==
This station is served by the following lines:
*Tokyo Metro
** 
*East Japan Railway Company
**Tōhoku Shinkansen
**Yamagata Shinkansen
**Akita Shinkansen
**Jōetsu Shinkansen
**Hokuriku Shinkansen
**Hokkaido Shinkansen
** Utsunomiya Line (Tōhoku Main Line)
** Takasaki Line
** Keihin–Tōhoku Line
** Yamanote Line
** Jōban Line

As this station was the traditional point of arrival and departure for journeys to northern Japan, it became the inspiration for many poems and song lyrics, including a famous poem by Ishikawa Takuboku. There is a memorial plate about this poem in the station.

==Station layout==
Like most major stations in Japan, Ueno Station contains and is surrounded by extensive shopping arcades. The station contains a branch of the Hard Rock Cafe.

===JR East platforms===

The station has two main levels of tracks and underground platforms for the Tōhoku Shinkansen tracks. Through tracks 1 to 4 on two island platforms on the main level are used by Yamanote Line and Keihin-Tohoku Line trains. Tracks 5 to 9 on two island platforms and one side of a terminal platform lead to the Ueno-Tokyo Line to Tokyo Station and beyond on the Tōkaidō Main Line. Tracks 10 to 12 terminate inside the building, and below these on a lower deck are further terminal tracks 13 to 17 (Track No.18 has been removed). Two subterranean island platforms serve Shinkansen tracks 19 to 22.

Chest-high platform edge doors were installed on the two Yamanote Line platforms (2 and 3) in November 2015, and brought into use from December.








===Tokyo Metro platforms===
Both the Ginza and Hibiya line station have two tracks; however, unlike in other Tokyo Metro stations, each line&#x27;s tracks are counted separately.


==History==
Ueno Station opened on 28 July 1883. 

After the destruction of the first building in the fires caused by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, Japanese Government Railways constructed the current station building. While digging the foundations of the new building, bones, swords, and lances dating from the Battle of Ueno where excavated.

In 1927, Tokyo Underground Railway (now Tokyo Metro) opened Japan&#x27;s first subway line from here to Asakusa Station. 

During World War II and the following years, many war orphans found refuge in the station and its underground tunnels. Following World War II, the neighbourhood in front of Ueno Station was a major center of black market activity. Today, many people come to the area to visit Ameya-Yokochō.

In March 1985, the Tōhoku Shinkansen was extended south from to Ueno, with the line extended further south to in June 1991.

The station facilities of the Ginza and Hibiya Lines were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

In March 2010, to promote the release of the Cho-Den-O Trilogy of the Kamen Rider movies, a special marking was used on the trains going to Nakano-fujimichō from Ueno, and &quot;Den-O&quot;&#x27;s Rina Akiyama greeted 200 fans who rode on the first of those trains.

Station numbering was introduced to the non-Shinkansen JR East platforms in 2016 with Ueno being assigned station numbers JU02 for the Utsunomiya line, JJ01 for the Jōban Line rapid service, JK31 for the Keihin–Tōhoku Line, and JY05 for the Yamanote line. At the same time, JR East assigned the station a three-letter code to its major transfer stations; Ueno was assigned the code &quot;UEN&quot;.

&quot;TH Liner&quot; services on the Hibiya Line between and commenced on 6 June 2020.
In March 2020, the Park Exit (Ueno Park Exit) was moved to the north and the roadway in front of it was changed to a dead end, allowing pedestrians to enter Ueno Park from the station without crossing the roadway.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by 181,880 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the thirteenth-busiest station operated by JR East. In fiscal 2013, the Tokyo Metro station was used by an average of 211,539 passengers per day (exiting and entering passengers), making it the eighth-busiest station operated by Tokyo Metro.

The daily passenger figures for each operator in previous years are as shown below.

* Note that JR East figures are for boarding passengers only.

In probability theory and statistics, the Zipf–Mandelbrot law is a discrete probability distribution. Also known as the Pareto–Zipf law, it is a power-law distribution on ranked data, named after the linguist George Kingsley Zipf, who suggested a simpler distribution called Zipf&#x27;s law, and the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who subsequently generalized it.

The probability mass function is given by

: formula_5

where formula_6 is given by

: formula_7

which may be thought of as a generalization of a harmonic number. In the formula, formula_8 is the rank of the data, and formula_9 and formula_10 are parameters of the distribution. In the limit as formula_11 approaches infinity, this becomes the Hurwitz zeta function formula_12. For finite formula_11 and formula_14 the Zipf–Mandelbrot law becomes Zipf&#x27;s law. For infinite formula_11 and formula_14 it becomes a zeta distribution.

==Applications==
The distribution of words ranked by their frequency in a random text corpus is approximated by a power-law distribution, known as Zipf&#x27;s law.

If one plots the frequency rank of words contained in a moderately sized corpus of text data versus the number of occurrences or actual frequencies, one obtains a power-law distribution, with exponent close to one (but see Powers, 1998 and Gelbukh &amp; Sidorov, 2001). Zipf&#x27;s law implicitly assumes a fixed vocabulary size, but the Harmonic series with &quot;s&quot; = 1 does not converge, while the Zipf–Mandelbrot generalization with &quot;s&quot; &gt; 1 does. Furthermore, there is evidence that the closed class of functional words that define a language obeys a Zipf–Mandelbrot distribution with different parameters from the open classes of contentive words that vary by topic, field and register.

In ecological field studies, the relative abundance distribution (i.e. the graph of the number of species observed as a function of their abundance) is often found to conform to a Zipf–Mandelbrot law.

Within music, many metrics of measuring &quot;pleasing&quot; music conform to Zipf–Mandelbrot distributions.

<text>Larry Don Austin (September 12, 1930 – December 30, 2018) was an American composer noted for his electronic and computer music works. He was a co-founder and editor of the avant-garde music periodical &quot;&quot;. Austin gained additional international recognition when he realized a completion of Charles Ives&#x27;s &quot;Universe Symphony&quot;. Austin served as the president of the International Computer Music Association (ICMA) from 1990 to 1994 and served on the board of directors of the ICMA from 1984 to 1988 and from 1990 to 1998.

==Early life==
Austin was born in Duncan, Oklahoma. He received a bachelor&#x27;s (Music Education, 1951) and master&#x27;s degree (Music, 1952) from University of North Texas College of Music. In 1955 he studied at Mills College, and from 1955 to 1958 he engaged in graduate study at the University of California, Berkeley, leaving to accept a faculty position at the University of California, Davis. Austin studied with Canadian composer Violet Archer at the University of North Texas, French composer Darius Milhaud at Mills College, and with American composer Andrew Imbrie at the University of California, Berkeley.

==Teaching career==
Austin taught at the University of California, Davis from 1958 till 1972 rising from assistant professor to full professor. While at the University of California, Davis, he founded the improvisational New Music Ensemble. In 1972 he accepted a position at the University of South Florida, where he taught until 1978. In that year he returned to Texas, teaching at his alma mater, the University of North Texas, from 1978 until 1996 when he was named professor emeritus. His notable students include William Basinski, Dary John Mizelle and Rodney Waschka II.

==Compositions==
Austin received early recognition for his instrumental and orchestral works and of those pieces, &quot;Improvisations for Orchestra and Jazz Soloists&quot;, was performed and recorded by the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein. Other orchestral works of special note include Charles Ives&#x27;s &quot;Universe&quot; Symphony, &quot;as realized and completed by Larry Austin&quot; (1974–93) for large orchestra, and &quot;Sinfonia Concertante: A Mozartean Episode&quot; (1986) for chamber orchestra and tape. Chamber works with particularly significant computer music/electro-acoustic music aspects include &quot;Accidents&quot; for electronically prepared piano (1967), written for David Tudor, &quot;Canadian Coastlines: Canonic Fractals for Musicians and Computer Band&quot; for eight musicians and tape from 1981, and &quot;BluesAx&quot; for saxophonist and tape (1995), which won the Magisterium Prize, at Bourges in 1996. &quot;BluesAx&quot; has been recorded by Steve Duke.
Later work included &quot;John Explains...&quot; (2007) for octophonic sound, based on a recording of an interview with John Cage. &quot;John Explains...&quot; was premiered at the 2008 North Carolina Computer Music Festival. At the CEMI Circles festival, Austin&#x27;s 2013 piece, &quot;Suoni della Bellagio—Sounds and sights of Bellagio, July–August, 1998&quot; for video and two-channel tape was premiered.

The noted critic Tom Johnson has written of Austin&#x27;s music, &quot;His style is neither uptown nor downtown, nor is it minimal, eclectic, hypnotic, or European. But it works, it is strongly personal, and it has something to say in all these directions... The real source of Austin&#x27;s music, however, is clearly Charles Ives, who also liked musical symbols, enjoyed collaging them together as densely as he could, and never had much of a knack for prettiness.&quot;

Austin said that &quot;Exploring new concepts, new materials and their interaction is essential to my work as a composer.&quot;

<doc id="390116" wikidata="Q4945042" url="?curid=390116" title="Borges on Martín Fierro">
<text>Borges on Martín Fierro concerns Argentine Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s comments on José Hernández&#x27;s nineteenth-century poem &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;. Like most of his compatriots, Borges was a great admirer of this work, which he often characterized as the one clearly great work in Argentine literature. Because &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; has been widely considered (beginning with Leopoldo Lugones&#x27;s &quot;El Payador&quot;, 1916) the fountainhead or pinnacle of Argentine literature, Argentina&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot; or &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, and because Borges was certainly Argentina&#x27;s greatest twentieth-century writer, Borges&#x27;s 1953 book of essays about the poem and its critical and popular reception–&quot;El &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;&quot; (written with Margarita Guerrero)—gives insight into Borges&#x27;s identity as an Argentine.

The poem&#x27;s central character, Martín Fierro, is a gaucho, a free, poor, &quot;pampas&quot;-dweller, who is illegally drafted to serve at a border fort defending against Indian attacks. He eventually deserts, and becomes a &quot;gaucho matrero&quot;, basically the Argentine equivalent of a North American western outlaw.

In his book of essays, Borges displays his typical concision, evenhandedness, and love of paradox, but he also places himself in the spectrum of views of &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; and, thus, effectively, gives a clue as to his (Borges&#x27;s) relation to nationalist myth. Borges has nothing but praise for the aesthetic merit of &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;, but refuses to project that as indicating moral merit for its protagonist. In particular, he describes it as sad that his countrymen read &quot;with indulgence or admiration&quot;, rather than horror, the famous episode in which Fierro provokes a duel of honor with a black gaucho and then kills him in the ensuing knife fight.

==Borges on &quot;gauchesque&quot; poetry==
Borges emphasizes that &quot;gauchesque&quot; poetry was not poetry written by gauchos, but generally by educated urban writers who adopted the eight-syllable line of the rural &quot;payadas&quot; (ballads), but often filled them with folksy expressions and with accounts of daily life that had no place in the &quot;serious and even solemn&quot; &quot;payadas&quot;. He views these works as a successful impersonation, facilitated by the interpenetration of rural and urban cultures, especially in the Argentine military. The author of &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; was one of the few gauchesque poets who ever actually lived as a gaucho.

Borges has far more respect for the early gauchesque poets than does Lugones, whom Borges sees as reducing them to mere precursors, &quot;sacrificing them to the greater glory of &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;&quot;. In this respect, Borges singles out the &quot;happy and valiant&quot; poetry of Ascasubi, which he contrasts to Hernández&#x27;s tragic lament. Borges clearly relishes the paradox that Ascasubi, a soldier with extensive experience of combat and whose work sometimes borders on the autobiographical, is at his most vivid in describing the Indian invasion of Buenos Aires province, which Ascasubi did not witness.

Borges is somewhat less impressed with Estanislao del Campo, author of &quot;Fausto&quot;, whom he characterizes as the most rural of the gauchesque poets in his diction, but the least comprehending of the mindset of the &quot;pampas&quot;-dweller. In contrast, he points out that Hernández is much closer to the language (if not the subject matter) of the &quot;payadas&quot;, relying far more on dialect spellings than exotic words to create his atmosphere, and, in the scenes within his poem where &quot;payadas&quot; are sung, showing his ability to write strictly within the &quot;payada&quot; form.

==Borges on the critics and &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;==
Borges sees Lugones in &quot;El Payador&quot; (1916) as operating in an explicitly nationalist tradition, seeking a national epic to take the role of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; or the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; and render the Argentines a &quot;people of the book&quot;, in a nationalist reflection of religious identity. Borges shows no small sympathy for Lugones, but argues that &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; is more of a verse novel than an epic, and very much a work of its time (the 1870s). Borges has far less sympathy with those who go beyond Lugones, such as Ricardo Rojas who wants to see in &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; literal or metaphorical analogues for almost every aspect of Argentine history and moral character, praising the work mostly for aspects that Borges finds &quot;conspicuous by their absence.&quot;

Borges is in more sympathy with Calixto Oyuela, who sees &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; as a tragic lament for the passing of the gaucho life and the fading of the Spanish-descended &quot;criollos&quot; into the emerging multi-ethnic Argentina. He also speaks briefly, but with praise, of Vicente Rossi, who sees Martín Fierro more as an &quot;orillero&quot; (hoodlum) than as a gaucho.
Borges mildly rebukes Miguel de Unamuno for denying the specifically Argentine character of the work, annexing it to Spanish literature, and is absolutely scathing on the subject of Eleuterio Tiscornia. Tiscornia&#x27;s excessively academic and Europeanizing approach to &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; produced a footnoted edition of the poem which Borges finds, at points, laughably misleading. Taking only a few well-aimed swipes at Tiscornia on his own behalf, Borges refers his readers to the work of Ezequiel Martínez Estrada for a proper demolition.

==Borges on &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;==
As remarked above, Borges greatly admired &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; as a work of art, but did not particularly admire its protagonist. 
In &quot;El &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;&quot;, he dissents from Lugones&#x27;s nationalist cult of the epic, but professes to admire &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; all the more in its aspect as a verse novel, concise and full of morally complex characters very much of a particular place and time. He sees in Hernández&#x27;s work a confluence of two Argentine literary traditions that previous critics had generally not distinguished: the rural &quot;payada&quot; and a separate and more artificial tradition of gauchesque poetry.

Both in his commentary on &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; and on its critics, Borges effectively positions himself, like Hernández, at a confluence of two literary traditions with common roots. In Borges&#x27;s own case, these are an Argentine national tradition and one more European. While clearly standing as a proud Argentine, he refuses to be placed in the position of glorifying even what he sees as flaws in the Argentine character.

<text>Nicholas of Tolentino (, c. 1246September 10, 1305) known as the &quot;Patron of Holy Souls&quot;, was an Italian saint and mystic. He is particularly invoked as an advocate for the souls in Purgatory, especially during Lent and the month of November. In many Augustinian and Discalced Augustinian churches, there are weekly devotions to St. Nicholas on behalf of the suffering souls. November 2, All Souls&#x27; Day, holds special significance for the devotees of St. Nicholas of Tolentino.

==Life==
Born in 1245 in Sant&#x27;Angelo in Pontano, St. Nicholas of Tolentino took his name from St. Nicholas of Myra, at whose shrine his parents prayed to have a child. Nicholas became a friar of the Order of Hermits of Saint Augustine at 18, and seven years later, he was ordained a priest. He gained a reputation as a preacher and a confessor. C. 1274, he was sent to Tolentino, near his birthplace. The town suffered from civil strife between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, in their struggle for control of Italy. Nicholas was primarily a pastor to his flock. He ministered to the poor and criminals. He is said to have cured the sick with bread dipped in water as instructed in a dream by Mary, the Mother of God. He gained a reputation as a wonderworker. Nicholas died in 1305 after a long illness. People began immediately to petition for his canonization. Eugene IV canonized him in 1446, and his body with severed arms was discovered in 1926 at Tolentino.

A studious, kind and gentle youth, at the age of 16 Nicholas became an Augustinian novice and was a student of the Blessed Angelus de Scarpetti. A friar at the Priory of St Augustine in Recanati, the priory at Macerata and others, he was ordained in 1270 at the age of 25, and soon became known for his preaching and teachings. Nicholas, who had had visions of angels reciting &quot;to Tolentino&quot;, in 1274 took this as a sign to move to that city, where he lived the rest of his life. Nicholas worked to counteract the decline of morality and religion which came with the development of city life in the late thirteenth century.

On account of his kind and gentle manner his superiors entrusted him with the daily feeding of the poor at the monastery gates, but at times he was so free with the friary&#x27;s provisions that the procurator begged the superior to check his generosity. Once, when weak after a long fast, he received a vision of Jesus, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and Saint Augustine. He was told to eat some bread marked with a cross and dipped in water. Upon doing so he was immediately stronger. He started distributing these rolls to the ailing, while praying to Mary, often curing the sufferers; this is the origin of the Augustinian custom of blessing and distributing &quot;Saint Nicholas Bread&quot;.
In Tolentino, Nicholas worked as a peacemaker in a city torn by strife between the Guelphs and Ghibellines who, in the conflict for control of Italy, supported the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor respectively. He ministered to his flock, helped the poor and visited prisoners. When working wonders or healing people, he always asked those he helped to &quot;Say nothing of this&quot;, explaining that he was just God&#x27;s instrument.

During his life, Nicholas is said to have received visions, including images of Purgatory, which friends ascribed to his lengthy fasts. Prayer for the souls in Purgatory was the outstanding characteristic of his spirituality. Because of this Nicholas was proclaimed patron of the souls in Purgatory, in 1884 by Leo XIII.

Towards the end of his life he became ill, suffering greatly, but still continued the mortifications that had been part of his holy life. Nicholas died on September 10, 1305.

==Legends==

There are many tales and legends which relate to Nicholas. One says the devil once beat him with a stick, which was then displayed for years in his church. In another, Nicholas, a vegetarian, was served a roasted fowl, for which he made the sign of the cross, and it flew out a window. Nine passengers on a ship going down at sea once asked Nicholas&#x27; aid, and he appeared in the sky, wearing the black Augustinian habit, radiating golden light, holding a lily in his left hand, and with his right hand, he quelled the storm. An apparition of the saint, it is said, once saved the burning palace of the Doge of Venice by throwing a piece of blessed bread on the flames. He was also reported to have resurrected over one hundred dead children, including several who had drowned together.

According to the Peruvian chronicler Antonio de la Calancha, it was St. Nicholas of Tolentino who made possible a permanent Spanish settlement in the rigorous, high-altitude climate of Potosí, Bolivia. He reported that all children born to Spanish colonists there died in childbirth or soon thereafter, until a father dedicated his unborn child to St. Nicholas of Tolentino (whose own parents, after all, had required saintly intervention to have a child). The colonist&#x27;s son, born on Christmas Eve, 1598, survived to healthy adulthood, and many later parents followed the example of naming their sons Nicolás.

==Veneration==
Nicholas was canonized by Pope Eugene IV (also an Augustinian) on June 5, 1446. He was the first Augustinian friar to be canonized. At his canonization, Nicholas was credited with three hundred miracles, including three resurrections.

The remains of St. Nicholas are preserved at the Shrine of Saint Nicholas in the Basilica di San Nicola da Tolentino in the city of Tolentino, province of Macerata in Marche, Italy.

He is particularly invoked as an advocate for the souls in Purgatory, especially during Lent and the month of November. In many Augustinian churches, there are weekly devotions to St. Nicholas on behalf of the suffering souls. November 2, All Souls&#x27; Day, holds special significance for the devotees of St. Nicholas of Tolentino.

St Pius V did not include him in the Tridentine calendar, but he was later inserted and given September 10 as his feast day. Judged to be of limited importance worldwide, his liturgical celebration was not kept in the 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar, but he is still recognized as one of the saints of the Roman Catholic Church.

A number of churches and oratories are dedicated to him, including San Nicolò da Tolentino in Venice, San Nicola da Tolentino agli Orti Sallustiani in Rome, St. Nicholas of Tolentino in The Bronx, New York City, San Nicolás Church in Barranquilla (which served as the city&#x27;s pro-cathedral church from 1932 to 1986), and St. Nicholas of Tolentino in Bristol, UK.

In Ireland, Augustinian churches and friaries historically marked his feast day with a ceremony distributing bread, sometimes with his likeness on the loaves. This practice was most strongly related to churches in County Waterford.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, the 16th century Church of San Nicolas de Tolentino in Banton, Romblon, was built in honor of him and his feast day is celebrated as the annual Biniray festival, commemorating the devotion of the island&#x27;s Catholic inhabitants to St. Nicholas during the Muslim raids in the 16th century.

In the province of Pampanga, a 440-year-old Augustinian church, which was founded in 1575, built in his honor is located in the heart of Macabebe, Pampanga. The façade of the church has scantly ornamentation and its architectural symmetry is lost amid and the various forms assumed the windows and the main entrance. Simple neo-classic lines of the façade. Presently, a second class relic of the saint is venerated every Tuesdays after the mass.

In the province of Nueva Ecija, St. Nicholas is being venerated as the titular of the historic Cabanatuan Cathedral where General Antonio Luna was assassinated in 1899. His first class relic is being exposed to the faithful from September 1 until September 10 every year.

In Dimiao, Bohol, the feast of San Nicolas de Tolentino, patron saint of the parish church built between 1797 and 1815, is also celebrated every September 10.

There is also the San Nicolas de Tolentino Parish Church along C. Padilla Street in Cebu City, the capital city of the province and island of Cebu. Built in 1584, the church is one of the oldest in the country. The church was also built years ahead of the establishment of the Cebu Diocese in 1595. Located some 1.5 kilometer south of the ciudad, it was called Cebu Viejo, separated from the ciudad by the Pagina creek and El Pardo. The area is also considered the original site of the landing of Miguel López de Legazpi&#x27;s armada on April 17, 1565, and became the embryo of a settlement which Legaspi established. San Nicolas was a vibrant town during the Spanish Period, the spawning ground for the Revolution against Spain in 1898, and the birthplace of Cebuano musical legends of the 20th century. The town eventually merged with Cebu City on April 17, 1901.

The 16th century church in Sinait, Ilocos Sur is dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Tolentino. In May 2021, Pope Francis elevated the parish church to the status of minor basilica.

In the Iloilo province, 4 municipalities consider San Nicolas de Tolentino as their patron saint. The Augustinians erected the San Nicolas de Tolentino Church in Ajuy, Iloilo when they arrived in 1590. The San Nicolas de Tolentino Church in Cabatuan, Iloilo (built in 1834; finished in 1866) were made of red brick exterior and is considered to be a Neoclassical church. In Guimbal, Iloilo, the construction of the San Nicolas de Tolentino Church and convent began between 1769 and 1774 and it was made of coral stone and yellow sandstone. In Lambunao, Iloilo, the consecration of the San Nicolas de Tolentino Church took place on September 9, 1890.

In the Bataan province, San Nicolas de Tolentino is the patron saint of Mariveles. The Augustinian Recollects missionaries erected Mariveles Church in 1729 in honor of the saint. It was consecrated on August 10, 2022 and declared as a diocesan shrine on February 25, 2023 by the then fourth Bishop of Balanga and church&#x27;s acting rector and parish priest Ruperto Santos.

===Cultural references===
San Nicholas cookie or &quot;Pan de San Nicolas&quot; is a Kapampangan cuisine delicacy originating since 1600s. It is baked in honor of Saint Nicholas &quot;(Apo Kulas)&quot;, the patron saint of bakers and the Municipality of Macabebe. According to legends, the Blessed Virgin Mary healed Saint Nicholas&#x27; illness with a piece of bread. The shortbread is made of butter, egg yolk, flour and coconut milk poured in wooden molds, then baked.

==Iconography==

He is depicted in the black habit of the Order of the Hermits of St. Augustine — a star above him or on his breast, a lily, or a crucifix garlanded with lilies, in his hand. Sometimes, instead of the lily, he holds a vial filled with money or bread.

<text>The Province of Lower Silesia (; Silesian German: &quot;Provinz Niederschläsing&quot;; ; ) was a province of the Free State of Prussia from 1919 to 1945. Between 1938 and 1941 it was reunited with Upper Silesia as the Province of Silesia. The capital of Lower Silesia was Breslau (now Wrocław in Poland). The province was further divided into two administrative regions (&quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot;), Breslau and Liegnitz.

The province was not congruent with the historical region of Lower Silesia, which now lies mainly in Poland. It additionally comprised the Upper Lusatian districts of Görlitz, Rothenburg and Hoyerswerda in the west, that until 1815 had belonged to the Kingdom of Saxony, as well as the former County of Kladsko in the southeast.

The province was disestablished at the end of World War II and with the implementation of the Oder–Neisse line in 1945, the area east of the Neisse river fell to the Republic of Poland. The smaller western part was incorporated into the German states of Saxony and Brandenburg.

== Post-1945 population ==
During the Polish post-war census of December 1950, data about the pre-war places of residence of the inhabitants as of August 1939 was collected. In case of children born between September 1939 and December 1950, their origin was reported based on the pre-war places of residence of their mothers. Thanks to this data it is possible to reconstruct the pre-war geographical origin of the post-war population. The same area corresponding to pre-1938 Province of Lower Silesia east of the Oder-Neisse line (which became Polish in 1945) was inhabited in December 1950 by:

Over 90% of the 1950 inhabitants were new to the region, with less than 10% residing in the province already back in August 1939 (so called autochthons, who had German citizenship before World War II and were granted Polish citizenship after 1945). The largest group among new inhabitants were Poles expelled from areas of Eastern Poland annexed by the USSR. The second largest group came from Southern Poland (from Kraków, Rzeszów, Lublin, Kielce and Katowice regions in total 28%) followed by Greater Poland. Many Poles from Bosnia settled around Bolesławiec.
