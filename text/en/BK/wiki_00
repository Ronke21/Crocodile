<text>Lake Onega (; also known as Onego; , ; ; Livvi: &quot;Oniegujärvi&quot;; ) is a lake in northwestern Russia, on the territory of the Republic of Karelia, Leningrad Oblast and Vologda Oblast. It belongs to the basin of the Baltic Sea, and is the second-largest lake in Europe after Lake Ladoga, slightly smaller than Lebanon. The lake is fed by about 50 rivers and is drained by the Svir.

There are about 1,650 islands on the lake. They include Kizhi, which hosts a historical complex of 89 Orthodox churches and other wooden structures of the 15th–20th centuries. The complex includes a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Kizhi Pogost. The eastern shores of the lake contain about 1,200 petroglyphs (rock engravings) dated to the 4th–2nd millennia BC, which have also been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The major cities on the lake are Petrozavodsk, Kondopoga and Medvezhyegorsk.

==Geological history==
The lake is of glacial-tectonic origin and is a small remnant of a larger body of water which existed in this area during an Ice Age. In geologic terms, the lake is rather young, formed – like almost all lakes in northern Europe – through the carving activity of the inland ice sheets in the latter part of the last ice age, about 12,000 years ago: In the Paleozoic Era (400–300 million years ago) the entire territory of the modern basin of the lake was covered with a shelf sea lying near the ancient, near-equatoric Baltic continent. Sediments at that time – sandstone, sand, clay and limestone – form a layer covering the Baltic Shield which consists of granite, gneiss and greenstone. The retreat of the Ice Age glaciers formed the Littorina Sea. Its level was first higher than at present, but it gradually lowered, thereby decreasing the sea area and forming several lakes in the Baltic region.

==Topography and hydrography==
Lake Onega has a surface area of without islands and a volume of ; its length is about and width about . It is the second largest lake in Europe, and the 18th largest lake by area in the world. Its southern banks are mostly low and continuous, whereas northern banks are rocky and rugged. They contain numerous elongated bays resulting in the lake&#x27;s outline appearing similar to a giant crayfish. In the northern part lies a large Zaonezhye Peninsula (); south of it, is the Big Klimenetsky () island. To the west of them lies the deep (deeper than ) Greater Onega () area containing the Kondopozhskaya (, depth up to ), Ilem-Gorskaya (), Lizhemskoy () and Unitskoy () bays. To the southwest of Greater Onega lies Petrozavodskoye Onego () containing the large Petrozavodsk and small Yalguba and Pinguba bays. To the east of Zaonezhye there is a bay, northern part of which is called Povenetsky Bay and the southern part is Zaonezhsky Bay. There, deep sections alternate with banks and islands which split the bay into several parts. The southernmost part of them, Lesser Onega, is deep. All the shores there are rocky.

The average depth of the lake is , and the deepest spot of is located in the northern part. The average depth is in the middle and rises to in the southern part. The bottom has a very uneven profile, it is covered with silt, and contains numerous trenches of various size and shape in the northern part. The trenches are separated by large shallow banks. Such bottom structure is favorable for fish, and the banks are used for commercial fishing.

The water level is stabilized by the Verhnesvirskaya hydropower plant and varies by only over the year. It rises due to the spring flood which lasts to 2 months. The highest water level is in June–August and the lowest is in March–April. Rivers bring of water per year to the lake, that is up to 74% of the water balance; the rest is provided by precipitation. Most of the lake water (84% or per year) outflows via a single river, Svir, and the remaining 16% evaporates from the lake surface. There are frequent storms more characteristic of a sea than a lake; waves of are not uncommon and may even reach . The lake freezes near the coast and bays in late November and December and around mid-January in its center. Thawing starts in April in the tributaries and reaches the lake in May. Water in the deep parts is clear, with the visibility up to . In the bays, the visibility may decrease to about a meter. The water is fresh, with a salinity of 35 mg/L. This is relatively low for a lake and is about times lower than in the other large lake of the area, Lake Ladoga.

The maximum surface water temperature is on the open lake and in the bays. The deep waters are much colder, from in winter to in summer. Weather is relatively cold, with temperatures below for half of the year and average summer temperatures of about .

==Basin and islands==
The catchment area of drains into the lake via 58 rivers and more than 110 tributaries, including the Shuya, Suna, Vodla, Vytegra and Andoma. The only outgoing Svir, which marks the southern boundary of Karelia, runs from the southwestern shore of Lake Onega to Lake Ladoga and continues as the Neva to the Gulf of Finland.

The White Sea–Baltic Canal runs through the lake from the White Sea to the Baltic Sea. The Volga–Baltic Waterway connects Onega Lake with the Volga, Caspian Sea and Black Sea. The Onega Canal, which follows the southern banks of the lake, was built in 1818–1820 and 1845–1852 between Vytegra in the east and Svir in the west. The canal was part of the Mariinsk Canal System, a forerunner of the Volga–Baltic Waterway, and aimed to create a quiet pass for boats avoiding the stormy waters of the lake. It is around wide, and lies between and from the shores of the lake. The canal is not used for active navigation at present.

There are about 1650 islands in the lake with a total area of about . Whereas the most famous is Kizhi, which contains historical wooden churches of the 18th century, the largest island is Big Klimenetsky with an area of . It contains a few settlements, a school and an hill. Other large islands are Big Lelikovsky and Suysari.

==Flora and fauna==
The lake banks are low and are flooded with raising water level. They are therefore swampy and are rich in reed, hosting ducks, geese and swans. The coastal region is covered with dense virgin forests. Major tree types are coniferous, but also common are lime (linden), elm and European alder. Common mammals include elks, brown bears, wolves, red foxes, European hares, blue hares, red squirrels, lynxes, pine martens, European badgers, as well as American muskrats and minks which were introduced to the area in the early 20th century. About 200 bird species from 15 families have been observed in the lake basin.

Lake Onega features a large variety of fish and water invertebrates, including relicts of the glacial period such as lamprey. There are about 47 fish species from 13 families; they include sturgeon, landlocked salmon, brown trout, European smelt, grayling, roaches, Crucian carp, whitefishes, char, pike, European cisco, common dace, silver bream, carp bream, sabre carp, spined loach, wels catfish, European eel, rudd, ide, gudgeon, pike-perch, European perch, ruffe and burbot.

==Ecology==
The lake area used to be clean but pollution is gradually increasing, especially in the northwestern and northern parts which contain the industrial facilities of Petrozavodsk, Kondopoga and Medvezhyegorsk. About 80% of the population and more than 90% of industry of the basin are concentrated in these areas. The pollution from these three cities amount to about of sewage and drainage water and of emissions per year. Human activity results in about of drain water per year, of which 46% are industrial and household water, 25% is stormwater runoff and 16% is melioration-related drainage. This drainage contains of phosphorus and of nitrogen; respectively of these elements are removed through the River Svir whereas the rest accumulates in the lake. Ships and motor boats (about 8,000 units) bring oil pollution at the level of about per navigation year, as well as phenols (), lead () and oxides of sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon.

==Economy==
The lake basin is a major source of granite, marble and black schist in Russia which have been exploited in the area since the early 18th century. Also advanced is metallurgy, especially in the Petrozavodsk area which produces about 25% of industrial products of Karelia. Water level of the lake is controlled by the Nizhnesvirskaya (, &quot;Lower Svir&quot;) and Verkhnesvirskaya (, &quot;Upper Svir&quot;) hydroelectric power plants. The former was built between 1927 and 1938 and has a peak power of 99 MW. The construction of Verkhnesvirskaya plant started in 1938, but was interrupted by World War II and could only be resumed in 1947. The plant was completed in 1952 and provided 160 MW of electric power. The associated with the plant Verkhnesvirsk Reservoir has an area of and volume of , i.e. almost the same as those of Onega Lake. Its construction raised the water level of the lake by .

The lake contains a well-developed navigation system which is part of the Volga–Baltic Waterway and White Sea – Baltic Canal, connecting the basins of Baltic, Caspian and the northern seas. These canals allow water transport of goods from the lake to the countries from Germany to Iran; most traffic goes to Finland, Sweden, Germany and Denmark. The Onega Canal running along the southern shore of the lake there is not used at present. Cargo on Lake Onega amounts to 10–12 million tonnes per year with about 10,300 ship voyages. Lake shores contain two ports (Petrozavodsk and Medvezhyegorsk), 5 wharves (Kondopoga, Povenets, Shala, Vytegra and Ascension ()) and 41 piers.

Fishery is an important activity on the lake. About 17 species are being fished commercially, mostly European cisco, smelt, whitefishes, roaches, burbot, pike-perch, perch, ruffe, carp bream, lake salmon, pike and somewhat less ide, graylings, common dace, common bleak and crucian carp.

Whereas there is no regular passenger service on the lake, there are several tourist trips per day along the routes of Petrozavodsk–Kizhi, Petrozavodsk–Velikaya Guba and Petrozavodsk–Shala. They are run by hydrofoil and motor ships and are used for passenger transport as well. In addition, passenger ships go on the route Petrozavodsk – Shala.

Sailing is a popular activity on the lake and there is a sailing club in Petrozavodsk. Since 1972, every year at the end of July the lake has hosted the largest regatta in Russia (&quot;&quot;) which is the Russian Open Championship in the Russian class of Cruisers Yachts &quot;Open800&quot;. The regatta has international status.

==History and places==

===Cities===
The largest city on the lake is Petrozavodsk – the capital of Republic of Karelia (about 270,000 citizens) – founded in 1703 by Peter I to exploit the natural ore deposits. The city contains several remarkable Neoclassical buildings from Catherine II&#x27;s reign, including the Circular Square and a gymnasium building (built in 1790). The embankment of Lake Onega contains a series of sculptures, many of which were presented as gifts from the twin cities.

Kondopoga has been known since 1495 and (before its destruction in 2018) contained the Uspenskaya (Assumption) Church from 1774. This edifice was the tallest wooden church of the Russian North. There are two carillons in the city, with 23 and 18 bells, also there is an indoor ice sports arena accommodating 1,850 spectators and a Palace of Arts with an organ.

The town of Medvezhyegorsk was founded in 1916 and from 1931 became the construction base of the White Sea – Baltic Canal. Between 1703–1710 and 1766–1769 a factory was operating on the site of the city. During the World War II this area was occupied by the Finnish forces and was a place of busy military activities.

===Kizhi island===

The main attraction of the lake is the island of Kizhi in the northern part of the lake, which is a State Historical, Architectural and Ethnographic Preservation Area. There are 89 wooden architectural monuments of the 15th to 20th centuries on the island. The most remarkable of those is Kizhi Pogost of the early 18th century which consists of a summer church with 22 domes, a winter church with nine domes, and a belfry. The pogost was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites in 1990. In the summer, there are daily boat connections to the island from Petrozavodsk.

===Onega petroglyphs===
Another attraction of the lake are the Onega petroglyphs (rock engravings). They are located on the eastern coast of the lake and date back to between the 4th and 2nd millennia BC. There are about 1,200 petroglyphs scattered over the area including several capes, such as Besov Nos (see map above). The engravings are deep and depict animals, people, boats and geometrical shapes of circular and crescent shapes.

In 2021, the petroglyphs were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for its significant artistic qualities that testify the creativity of the Stone Age.

===Others===
Many other historical monuments are scattered around the lake. They include the Dormition Monastery (ru) on the cape Muromsky, on the eastern shore of the lake. The monastery was founded in 1350, closed in 1918 and revived in 1991.

<doc id="374541" wikidata="Q1465984" url="?curid=374541" title="Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)">
<text>The Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem (), commonly known as the Order of St John, and also known as St John International, is an order of chivalry constituted in 1888 by royal charter from Queen Victoria and dedicated to St John the Baptist.

The order traces its origins back to the Knights Hospitaller in the Middle Ages, the oldest surviving chivalric order which is generally considered to be founded in Jerusalem in 1099, which was later known as the Order of Malta. A faction of them emerged in France in the 1820s and moved to Britain in the early 1830s, where, after operating under a succession of grand priors and different names, it became associated with the founding in 1882 of the St John Ophthalmic Hospital near the old city of Jerusalem and the St John Ambulance Brigade in 1887.

The order is found throughout the Commonwealth of Nations, Hong Kong, the Republic of Ireland, and the United States of America, with the worldwide mission &quot;to prevent and relieve sickness and injury, and to act to enhance the health and well-being of people anywhere in the world.&quot; The order&#x27;s approximately 25,000 members, known as , are mostly of the Protestant faith, though those of other Christian denominations, as well as adherents of other religions are accepted into the order. Except via appointment to certain government or ecclesiastical offices in some realms, membership is by invitation only and individuals may not petition for admission.

The Order of St John is perhaps best known for the health organisations it founded and continues to run, including St John Ambulance and St John Eye Hospital Group. As with the order, the memberships and work of these organisations are not constricted by denomination or religion. The order is a constituent member of the Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem. Its headquarters are in London and it is a registered charity under English law.

==History==

===Emergence===
In the 1820s, those Knights of Malta residing in France granted knighthoods to certain people of various Christian denominations who provided support to the Order in England.

In 1823, the Council of the French Langues—a French state-backed and hosted faction of the Order of Malta (Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta)—sought to raise through private subscription sufficient money to restore a territorial base for the Order of Malta and aid the Greek War of Independence. This was to be achieved by issuing bonds in London to form a mercenary army of demobilised British soldiers using readily available, cheap war surplus. A deal transferring various islands to the Order of Malta, including Rhodes when captured, was struck with the Greek rebels, but, ultimately, the attempt to raise money failed when details leaked to the press, the French monarchy withdrew its backing of the Council, and the bankers refused the loan.
The Council was re-organised and the Marquis de Sainte-Croix du Molay (previously number two of the Council and a former Order of Malta administrator in Spain) became its head. In June 1826, a second attempt was made to raise money to restore a Mediterranean homeland for the Order when Philippe de Castellane, a French Knight of Malta, was appointed by the Council to negotiate with supportive persons in Britain. Scotsman Donald Currie was in 1827 given the authority to raise £240,000. Anyone who subscribed to the project and all commissioned officers of the mercenary army were offered the opportunity of being appointed knights of the Order. Few donations were attracted, though, and the Greek War of Independence was won without the help of the knights of the Council of the French Langues. Castellane and Currie were then allowed by the French Council to form the Council of the English Langue, which was inaugurated on 12 January 1831, under the executive control of Alejandro, conde de Mortara, a Spanish aristocrat. It was headquartered at what Mortara called the &quot;Auberge of St John&quot;, St John&#x27;s Gate, Clerkenwell. This was the Old Jerusalem Tavern, a public house occupying what had once been a gatehouse to the ancient Clerkenwell Priory, the medieval Grand Priory of the Knights Hospitaller, otherwise known as the Knights of Saint John. The creation of the langue has been regarded either as a revival of the Knights Hospitaller or the establishment of a new order.
The Reverend Sir Robert Peat, the absentee perpetual curate of St Lawrence, Brentford, in Middlesex, and one of the many former chaplains to Prince George (Prince Regent and later King George IV), had been recruited by the Council as a member of the society in 1830. On 29 January 1831, in the presence of Philip de Castellane and the Agent-General of the French Langues, Peat was elected prior &quot;ad interim&quot;. Then, on the grounds that he had been selling knighthoods, Peat and other English members of the organisation expelled Mortara, with the backing of the Council of the French Langues, leading to the existence of two competing English chivalric groups between early 1832 and Mortara&#x27;s disappearance in 1837. On 24 February 1834, three years after becoming prior &quot;ad interim&quot;, in order to publicly reaffirm his claim to the office of Prior and in the hope of reviving a charter of Queen Mary I dealing with the original English branch of the Order of Malta, Peat took the oath &quot;de fideli administratione&quot; in the Court of the King&#x27;s Bench, before the Lord Chief Justice. Peat was thus credited as being the first &quot;Grand Prior&quot; of the association, but in January 1919 &quot;W.B.H.&quot; wrote to the journal &quot;Notes &amp; Queries&quot;: &quot;His name is not in the knights&#x27; lists, and he was never &#x27;Prior in the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem&#x27;: he became an ordinary member of that Order on Nov. 11, 1830.&quot;
Sir Robert Peat died in April 1837 and Sir Henry Dymoke was appointed Grand Prior and re-established contact with the knights in France and Germany, into which the group had by that time expanded. However, until the late 1830s, only the English arm of the organisation had considered itself to be a grand priory and langue of the Order of St John, having never been recognised as such by the established order. Dymoke sought to rectify this by seeking acknowledgement from the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Sovereign Military Order of Malta, but its then Lieutenant Grand Master, Philippe de Colloredo-Mansfeld, refused the request. In response to this rebuff, the English body declared itself to be the Sovereign Order of St John in England, under the title The Sovereign and Illustrious Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, Anglia, thereby emphasising the order&#x27;s independence and claim to direct and continuous succession from the Order of St John that was established in the 11th century. This new entity grew its membership over the ensuing three decades and, in 1861, William Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester, agreed to become its grand prior. Additionally, an associated national hospitaller organisation was formed with a corps of ambulances.

===Order of St John of Jerusalem in Great Britain===
In 1871, the Duke of Manchester instituted a new constitution, which again changed the order&#x27;s name, offering the more modest Order of Saint John of Jerusalem in England, abandoning the pretension to the title of &quot;Sovereign Order&quot;. Five years later, Princess Alexandra was appointed a Lady of Justice, and this was followed by her husband, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) becoming a Knight. Two years later, Sir Edmund Lechmere bought St John&#x27;s Gate as the order&#x27;s headquarters; the property was initially leased from Lechmere, before the order acquired the freehold in 1887. In 1877, the order established various St John Ambulance associations in major railway centres and mining districts, so that railway men and colliers could learn how to treat victims of accidents with first aid; in 1882, the Grand Priory founded a hospice and ophthalmic dispensary in Jerusalem (known today as the St John of Jerusalem Eye Hospital Group); and, by 1887, had established the St John Ambulance Brigade, which undertook practical and life-saving work.

The name given in 1888, when the order was first constituted as the present order of chivalry by Queen Victoria&#x27;s royal charter was Grand Priory of the Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem in England. This was changed by the royal charter of 1926 to the Grand Priory in the British Realm of the Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem and further in 1936 to the Grand Priory in the British Realm of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. In 1961, it played a role, together with the Protestant Continental branches of the original Order of Saint John (the &quot;Johanniter Orders&quot; in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and elsewhere), in the establishment of the Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem and thereafter finally received (through an agreement in 1963) collateral recognition by the Order of Malta. Its most recent royal charter was granted in 1955, with a supplemental charter issued in 1974, recognising the worldwide scope of the organisation by setting its present name. In 1999, the order received special consultative status from the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

==Structure==
===Officers===
Charles III is at the apex of the Order of St John as its Sovereign Head, followed by the Grand Prior—since 1975, Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester. He, along with the four or five other Great Officers—the Lord Prior of St John, who acts as the lieutenant of and deputy to the Grand Prior; the Prelate, who is an Anglican bishop; the Deputy Lord Prior (or more than one depending on the Grand Prior&#x27;s needs), who acts accordingly as a lieutenant and deputy to the Lord Prior; and the Sub-Prelate, who has interests in the commanderies and associations of the organisation—as well as the Priors and Chancellors of each of the order&#x27;s eight priories and the Hospitaller make up the Grand Council. On recommendation of that body, the Grand Prior appoints all the Grand Officers, besides himself, and may also appoint members of either Grade I or Grade II as other officers, known as the Principal Officers, such as the Secretary-General and Honorary Officers, such as the Genealogist, (currently David White, Garter King of Arms) and Director of Ceremonies, who all hold office for a period not exceeding three years; the latter position currently being held by Alan Cook, a former Essex Police chief inspector on behalf of Major James Kelly. The Grand Prior may also appoint a Secretary of the Order, who holds office at the pleasure of the Grand Prior or until resignation. A subset of the Grand Council is the Honours and Awards Committee, which considers all recommendations for appointment or promotion into the grade of Bailiff or Dame Grand Cross, appointment or promotion into any grade of a person not resident within any priory&#x27;s territory, and advises the Grand Council in respect of the award of its Lifesaving Medal and Service Medal.

===Grades===
After the officers of the Order follow members, who are divided into six hierarchical grades, all having accordant post-nominal letters. Grade I is limited to only the members of the Grand Council plus no more than 21 others, though royalty and heads of state of any country may be appointed as a Bailiff or Dame Grand Cross without counting towards the complement. All Priors, should they not already be in the grade or higher, are appointed Knight or Dame upon their assignment. Knights and Dames of Justice, along with all Bailiffs and Dames Grand Cross, formerly were entitled to nominate two personal Esquires, just as each Knight or Dame of Grace could nominate one personal Esquire, subject to the Grand Council&#x27;s scrutiny.


Knights and Dames receive the accolade from the Grand Prior when they are touched on the shoulder with a sword and are given their robes and insignia. However, jurisdiction dependent, post-nominal letters of the order are not used outside the organisation itself, and a Knight and Dame may not use the prefix &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Dame&quot;, though they may request from their local heraldic authority a personal coat of arms, should they not already be entitled to use one, and have it adorned with emblems of the Order of St John. Bailiffs and Dames Grand Cross additionally have the right to be granted heraldic supporters for life. Further, membership only grants precedence within the Order, which is graded as follows:

# The Sovereign Head
# The Grand Prior
# The Lord Prior of St John
# The Prior of a Priory or the Knight or Dame Commander of a Commandery when within the territory of the establishment
# The Prelate of the Order
# The Deputy Lord Prior or the Deputy Lord Priors and if more than one by seniority in their grade
# The Sub-Prior of the Order
# Former Great Officers
# Bailiffs and Dames Grand Cross
# The Prior of a Priory or the Knight or Dame Commander of a Commandery outside the territory of the establishment
# Members of the Grand Council not included above by seniority in their grade
# The Principal Officers by seniority of their office
# The Sub-Prelates and the Honorary Sub-Prelates
# The Hospitaller of the Order
# Knights and Dames
# Chaplains
# Commanders
# Officers
# Members (formerly Serving Brothers and Serving Sisters)
# Priory Esquires (Priory Esquires are not members of the Order)

Precedence within each grade is dictated by date of appointment, save for those in Grade I who are either a head of state or royal, in which case they all precede other members in their grade as follows:

# Members of the Sovereign&#x27;s family
# Heads of state from the Commonwealth of Nations
# Foreign heads of state
# Members of other Commonwealth royal families
# Members of foreign royal families

Awards are presented within the order: the Priory Vote of Thanks, the St John&#x27;s Provincial/Territorial Commendation (in Canada), the Life Saving Award (Without Risk) in Silver, and the Service Medal of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem.

===Priories and commanderies===

Following constitutional changes made in 1999, the Priory of England and The Islands was established (including the Commandery of Ards in Northern Ireland) alongside the existing Priories of Wales, Scotland, Canada, Australia (including the Commandery of Western Australia), New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. In 2013, the Priory of Kenya and in 2014 the Priory of Singapore were formed. Each is governed by a prior and a priory chapter. Commanderies, governed by a Knight or Dame Commander and a commandery chapter, may exist within or wholly or partly without the territory of a priory, known as Dependent or Independent Commanderies, respectively. Any country without a priory or commandery of its own is assumed into the &quot;home priory&quot; of England and The Islands, many of these being smaller Commonwealth of Nations states in which the order has only a minor presence.

The Order of St John is said to have arrived in Canada in 1648, as the second Governor of New France, Charles de Montmagny, was a member of the original order, but it was not until 1883 that the first branch of the modern organisation was established in the Dominion, at Quebec City, growing to 12 branches by 1892. The Order of St John today constitutes part of the Canadian national honours system and the priory, established in 1946 out of the Commandery of Canada, is the largest outside of the United Kingdom, with some 6,000 members. The governor general, serves as the prior and chief officer in Canada, while lieutenant governors act as the vice-priors, overseeing the administration of the order in their respective province. These individuals thus automatically become Knights or Dames of Justice upon their assuming viceregal office.

An American Society of the Order of St John was established in 1957 as a foundation to assist the order with charitable work, after 1961 focusing its efforts specifically on the St John Ophthalmic Hospital in Jerusalem and some other organisations aiding the sick. This branch was successful enough that Queen Elizabeth II in 1996 officially created the Priory of the United States of America, the seventh priory at the time, with John R. Drexel as the first prior. By late 2000, the US Priory had approximately 1,100 members. As citizens of a country that did not have the sovereignty of the Order of St John vested in its head of state, American inductees who first joined the new priory were specifically asked to only &quot;pay due obedience&quot; to the governing authorities of the order &quot;in all things consistent with your duty to your own country,&quot; thus eliminating any question of loyalty to a foreign head of state superseding American postulants&#x27; duties as US citizens.

==Vestments and insignia==
Upon admission into the Order of St John, confrères are presented with appropriate insignia, each level and office being depicted by different emblems and robes for wear at important occasions for the order. Common for all members of the Order is the badge, consisting of an eight-pointed Maltese Cross (embellished in the four principal angles alternately with two lions passant guardant and two unicorns passant). That for the Sovereign Head is gold with arms of white enamel and the embellishments rendered in gold, all surmounted by a jewelled St Edward&#x27;s Crown, while those for the Officers of the order are the same save for the Grand Prior&#x27;s having the crown made only of gold; the Lord Prior&#x27;s having in place of the St Edward&#x27;s Crown the coronet in gold of Albert, Prince of Wales (later Edward VII); and the Prelate&#x27;s having instead a representation of a mitre in gold. Thereafter, the badges are prescribed as follows:

All Bailiffs and Dames Grand Cross may wear their badges at the left hip on a (for men) or (for women) wide, black watered silk ribbon over the right shoulder and from a wide black band at the collar. Male Knights Justice or Grace and Commanders wear their badges on a 16.5mm wide ribbon at the neck, while Officers and Members have theirs on a straight ribbon suspended from a medal bar on the left breast. Females in all grades have the option of wearing their insignia on a ribbon bow pinned at the left shoulder. Bailiffs and Dames Grand Cross, Knights and Dames of Justice or Grace, and chaplains may all also wear a breast star, which appears the same as their badges, only at a diameter of and without embellishments for those in Grade I and for those in Grade II. Further, those in these groups are also given a button for wear on the lapel of non-formal civilian clothing, for events such as business meetings of the order. In general, the insignia of the Order of St John may be worn at all occasions where other decorations are worn, not only those connected with the ceremonies of the order.
All members of the Order are also required to wear specific robes for formal occasions of the society, including a mantle, sopra vest, and hat. The mantles of the Sovereign Head and Grand Prior are all of black silk velvet and lined with white silk, the Sovereign Head&#x27;s mantle is differentiated by an additional train. Bailiffs and Dames Grand Cross and, before 1926, Knights of Justice formerly wore black silk robes with a lining of the same material and colour; these members now wear the same mantle as Commanders and Officers, which are made of black merino wool faced with black silk. The only other unique mantles are those of the Medical Officer of the St John Ophthalmic Hospital, which bears a special pattern, and of chaplains, which is a black silk robe with full sleeves. Each cloak also bears on its left side a rendition of the order&#x27;s star in white silk: the Sovereign Head, Grand Prior, and those in the first two grades of the order all have a diameter emblem; the Sovereign&#x27;s and Grand Prior&#x27;s are of white silk with gold adornments, the former&#x27;s also surmounted by a St Edward&#x27;s Crown, while those for Bailiffs and Dames Grand Cross, Knights and Dames of Justice, and Knights and Dames of Grace are rendered in white linen, the first two groups having embellishments in gold silk, the latter in white silk. Similarly, the star for Commanders and Officers is of white linen with white silk ornamentation, though they are only and in diameter, respectively. The secretaries of the order, the priors and the commanders also wear the badge superimposed upon two goose quill pens embroidered saltire-wise in white silk.

The sopra (or supra) vest is a long drape of thin, black cloth that buttons close down the neck and to one side, falling to the ankles and cut so as to entirely cover the body. It is similar to a cassock, though it is actually derived from the supra vesta—a black surcoat worn in the mid-13th century by the Knights of St John. Confrères in Grade I have a plain, white, 300mm diameter Maltese Cross on their sopra vests, while members of Grades II and III, plus chaplains, have a plain garment, though the wearer&#x27;s Order of St John insignia is displayed outside the vest, 152mm below the collar. Clerical inductees of the order may, when officiating, wear over their cassock and surplice a mozzetta of black with red lining, edging, and buttons, a 76mm wide star worn on the left breast and the accordant badge suspended at the neck. When full mantles and sopra vests are worn a black velvet Tudor-style hat is included.

==Eligibility and appointment==

The Sovereign Head confirms all appointments to the order as he, in his absolute discretion, shall think fit, though the constitution does impose certain limitations: the maximum number of members is set at 35,000, and appointees may not be under the age of 18. Recommendations are made by the Grand Council and those selected have generally acted in such a manner as to strengthen the spirit of mankind—as reflected in the order&#x27;s first motto, &quot;Pro Fide&quot;—and to encourage and promote humanitarian and charitable work aiding those in sickness, suffering, and/or danger—as reflected in the order&#x27;s other motto, &quot;Pro Utilitate Hominum&quot;.

To be inducted, new members must recite the organisation&#x27;s declaration:
Those who are Christians additionally recite the following:
Notwithstanding the order&#x27;s promotion of Christian values of charity and its official stance that the order has a &quot;Christian character&quot;, its Grand Council has since 1999 affirmed that &quot;profession of the Christian Faith should not be a condition of membership of the Order.&quot; The issue of the order&#x27;s Christian character and the issue of &quot;inclusive membership&quot; was dealt with in the Grand Council&#x27;s &quot;Pro Fide Report&quot; in 2005, wherein it was said that the order&#x27;s life is shaped by Christian faith and values, but that &quot;[r]ather than the emphasis being primarily upon &#x27;spiritual beliefs or doctrine&#x27; it is on works of mercy rendered through St John&quot;. Therefore, while the Great Officers are required to profess the Christian faith, the same is &quot;not an essential condition of membership&quot; and &quot;[t]he onus is on the man or woman who is invited to the privilege of membership to decide whether he or she can with a good conscience promise to be faithful to the stated aims and purposes of this Christian lay order of chivalry.&quot; On the subject of inclusive membership, the report stated &quot;Christian hospitality is a criterion which can be applied to the Order&#x27;s relationships to persons of other religious faiths&quot;, and &quot;the Order needs to be characterized by a hospitable disposition towards other faith traditions while holding fast to its own origins and foundational identity in Christian faith.&quot;

==Order of wear==

<text>Moscow State University (MSU), officially M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State University, is a public research university in Moscow, Russia. The university includes 15 research institutes, 43 faculties, more than 300 departments, and six branches. Alumni of the university include past leaders of the Soviet Union and other governments. As of 2019, 13 Nobel laureates, six Fields Medal winners, and one Turing Award winner were affiliated with the university.

==History==
===Imperial Moscow University===

Ivan Shuvalov and Mikhail Lomonosov promoted the idea of a university in Moscow, and Russian Empress Elizabeth decreed its establishment on .

The first lectures were given on . Saint Petersburg State University and MSU each claim to be Russia&#x27;s oldest university. Though Moscow State University was founded in 1755, St. Petersburg which has had a continuous existence as a &quot;university&quot; since 1819 sees itself as the successor of an academy established on in 1724, by a decree of Peter the Great.

MSU originally occupied the Principal Medicine Store on Red Square from 1755 to 1787. Catherine the Great transferred the university to a building on the other side of Mokhovaya Street, constructed between 1782 and 1793, to a design by Matvei Kazakov, and rebuilt by Domenico Giliardi after fire consumed much of Moscow in 1812.
In the 18th century, the university had three departments: philosophy, medicine, and law. A preparatory college was affiliated with the university until its abolition in 1812. In 1779, Mikhail Kheraskov founded a boarding school for noblemen (Благородный пансион) which in 1830 became a gymnasium for Russian nobility. The university press, run by Nikolay Novikov in the 1780s, published the newspaper in Imperial Russia: &quot;Moskovskie Vedomosti&quot;.

In 1804, medical education split into clinical (therapy), surgical, and obstetrics faculties. Between 1884 and 1897, the Department of Medicine built a medical campus in Devichye Pole, between the Garden Ring and Novodevichy Convent; designed by , with university doctors like Nikolay Sklifosovskiy and Fyodor Erismann acting as consultants. The campus, and medical education in general, were separated from Moscow University in 1930. Devichye Pole was operated by the independent I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University and by various other state and private institutions.

The roots of student unrest in the university reach deep into the nineteenth century. In 1905, a social-democratic organization emerged at the university and called for the overthrow of the Czarist government and the establishment of a republic in Russia. The imperial government repeatedly threatened to close the university. In 1911, in a protest over the introduction of troops onto the campus and mistreatment of certain professors, 130 scientists and professors resigned &quot;en masse&quot;, including Nikolay Dimitrievich Zelinskiy, Pyotr Nikolaevich Lebedev, and Sergei Alekseevich Chaplygin; thousands of students were expelled.

===Moscow State University===
====1917–49====
After the October Revolution of 1917, the institution began to admit children of the proletariat and peasantry. In 1919, the university abolished tuition fees, and established a preparatory facility to help working-class children prepare for entrance examinations. During the implementation of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s first five-year plan (1928–32), prisoners from the Gulag were forced to construct parts of the newly expanded university.

====1950–99====

In 1970, the university imposed a 2% quota on Jewish students. A 2014 article entitled &quot;Math as a tool of anti-semitism&quot; in &quot;The Mathematics Enthusiast&quot; discussed antisemitism in the Moscow State University&#x27;s Department of Mathematics during the 1970s and 1980s.

In the mid-1980s, the Dean of MSU&#x27;s law faculty was dismissed for taking bribes. After 1991, nine new faculties were established. The following year, the university gained a unique status: it is funded directly from the state budget (bypassing the Ministry of Education).

On 6 September 1997, French electronic musician Jean Michel Jarre used the front of the university as the backdrop for a concert. The concert attracted a paying crowd of half a million people.

====2000–2020====
In 2007, MSU Rector Viktor Sadovnichy said that corruption in Russia&#x27;s education system was a &quot;systemic illness,&quot; and that he had seen an ad guaranteeing a perfect score on entrance exams to MSU, for a significant fee.

On 19 March 2008, Russia&#x27;s most powerful supercomputer to date, the SKIF MSU (; &quot;skif&quot; means &#x27;Scythian&#x27; in Russian) was launched at the university. Its peak performance of 60 TFLOPS (LINPACK – 47.170 TFLOPS) made it the fastest supercomputer in the Commonwealth of Independent States.

In November 2012, Mikhail Basharatyan, Deputy Dean of the MSU World Economy Department, was fired for taking a bribe from a pupil. In February 2013, Andrei Andriyanov resigned as head of the Kolmogorov Special Educational and Scientific Center of the university, after an investigation concluded that he had included fake references in his doctoral thesis.

====2020–present====
In March 2022, Victor Sadovnichy, rector of Moscow State University and president of the Russian Union of Rectors, was the lead signature in a public statement endorsing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In reaction, Academia Europaea, a pan-European academy, suspended the membership of Sadovnichy. In response to the Russian invasion, that same month Yale University, the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, University of Potsdam, and HKU Business School suspended their longstanding relationships with the university, and the University of St Andrews suspended a joint master&#x27;s degree programme with the university. Intel and AMD, the largest chip manufacturers in the world, whose processors are used in the Moscow State University supercomputer, as well as Nvidia, reacted by suspending deliveries of their processors to Russia.

==Campus==
Since 1953, most of the faculties have been situated on Sparrow Hills, in southwest Moscow. In the post-war era, Joseph Stalin ordered seven tiered neoclassic towers to be built around the city. It was built using Gulag labour, as were many of Stalin&#x27;s Great Construction Projects in Russia. The MSU main building was the tallest building in Europe until 1990. The central tower is 240 m tall, 36 stories high.

Along with the university administration, the Museum of Earth Sciences and faculties of Mechanics and Mathematics, Geology, Geography, and Fine and Performing Arts are in the main building. The building on Mokhovaya Street houses the Faculty of Journalism, the Faculty of Psychology, and Institute of Asian and African Countries. A number of faculty buildings are located near Manege Square in the centre of Moscow and a number of campuses abroad in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The Ulyanovsk branch of MSU was reorganized into Ulyanovsk State University in 1996.

==Faculties==

As of 2009, the university had 39 faculties and 15 research centres. A number of small faculties opened, such as Faculty of Physics and Chemistry and Higher School of Television. The full list of faculties is as follows:
* Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics
* Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics
* Faculty of Physics

==Academic reputation==


In world rankings, MSU was ranked 101st–150th by the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2024, and 87th by &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; 2024&quot;.&quot; 

The university has contacts with universities throughout the world, exchanging students and lecturers. It houses the UNESCO International Demography Courses and Hydrology Courses. In 1991 the French University College, the Russian-American University, and the Institute of German Science and Culture were opened.

The institution&#x27;s academic reputation was severely undermined because of its support for the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. (See: sanctions).

==Staff and students==
The university employs more than 4,000 academics and 15,000 support staff. Approximately 5,000 researchers work at the university&#x27;s research institutes and facilities. More than 40,000 undergraduates and 7,000 advanced degree candidates are enrolled. Annually, the university hosts approximately 2,000 students, graduate students, and researchers from around the world.

==Notable people==
As of 2017, 13 Nobel laureates, 6 Fields Medal winners and one Turing Award winner had been affiliated with the university. It is the alma mater of writers Anton Chekhov, Boris Pasternak, and Ivan Turgenev; politicians Mikhail Gorbachev, Mikhail Suslov, and Ruslan Khasbulatov; and mathematicians and physicists Vladimir Arnold, Boris Demidovich, Vladimir Drinfeld, Vitaly Ginzburg, Andrey Kolmogorov, Grigory Margulis, Andrei Sakharov, and Yakov Sinai.

<text>The Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS; &quot;Rossíyskaya akadémiya naúk&quot;) consists of the national academy of Russia; a network of scientific research institutes from across the Russian Federation; and additional scientific and social units such as libraries, publishing units, and hospitals. Peter the Great established the academy (then the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences) in 1724 with guidance from Gottfried Leibniz.

From its establishment, the academy benefitted from a slate of foreign scholars as professors; the academy then gained its first clear set of goals from the 1747 Charter. The academy functioned as a university and research center throughout the mid-18th century until the university was dissolved, leaving research as the main pillar of the institution. The rest of the 18th century continuing on through the 19th century consisted of many published academic works from Academy scholars and a few Academy name changes, ending as The Imperial Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences right before the Soviet period.

Now headquartered in Moscow, the academy (RAS) is a non-profit organization established in the form of a federal state budgetary institution chartered by the Government of Russia. In 2013, the Russian government restructured RAS, assigning control of its property and research institutes to a new government agency headed by Mikhail Kotyukov. , the academy included 1,008 institutions and other units; in total, about 125,000 people were employed of whom 47,000 were scientific researchers.

==Membership==
There are three types of membership in the RAS: full members (academicians), corresponding members, and foreign members. Academicians and corresponding members must be citizens of the Russian Federation when elected; however, some academicians and corresponding members were elected before the collapse of the USSR and are now citizens of other countries. Members of RAS are elected based on their scientific contributions – election to membership is considered very prestigious.

In the years 2005–2012, the academy had approximately 500 full and 700 corresponding members. In 2013, after the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences became incorporated into the RAS, a number of the RAS members accordingly increased. The last elections to the renewed Russian Academy of Sciences were organized from May 30 to June 3, 2022.

As of November 2, 2024, the academy had 1873 living Russian members (full: 802, corresponding: 1071) and about 430 foreign members. Since 2015, the academy also awards, on a competitive basis, the honorary scientific rank of a RAS Professor to the top-level researchers with Russian citizenship. RAS professorship is not a membership type but its holders are considered as possible candidates for membership; some professors became members already in 2016, in 2019 or in 2022 and are henceforth titled &quot;RAS professor, corresponding member of the RAS&quot; (163 scientists) or even &quot;RAS professor, academician of the RAS&quot; (16 scientists). There are 713 scientists with this rank.

==Present structure==
The RAS consists of 13 specialized scientific divisions, four territorial branches and 15 regional scientific centers. The academy has numerous councils, committees, and commissions, all organized for different purposes.

===Territorial branches===

Member institutions are linked via a dedicated Russian Space Science Internet (RSSI). Started with just three members, The RSSI now has 3,100 members, including 57 from the largest research institutions. Russian universities and technical institutes are not under the supervision of the RAS (they are subordinated to the Ministry of Education of Russian Federation), but a number of leading universities, such as Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University, Novosibirsk State University, and the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, make use of the staff and facilities of many institutes of the RAS (as well as of other research institutions); the MIPT faculty refers to this arrangement as the &quot;Phystech System&quot;.

From 1933 to 1992, the main scientific journal of the Soviet Academy of Sciences was the &quot;Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences&quot; (); after 1992, it became simply &quot;Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences&quot; (). The academy is also increasing its presence in the educational area. In 1990, the Higher Chemical College of the Russian Academy of Sciences was founded, a specialized university intended to provide extensive opportunities for students to choose an academic path.

==History==
=== In the Russian Empire ===

==== Creation of the Academy ====
The academy was a culmination of Emperor Peter the Great&#x27;s inspiration from his tours to Western Europe and its higher education centers along with the beginning of his correspondence with Gottfried Leibniz, a philosopher, mathematician, and diplomat. Peter&#x27;s Western European travels introduced him to the new inventions and ideas of the Enlightenment period. Leibniz was attracted to Peter&#x27;s desire to promote education and science in Russia through modernization of the academic system as he had seen in Western Europe, although he could not get a meeting with Peter during Peter&#x27;s first European tour. Leibniz did, however, begin correspondence with Peter&#x27;s advisors where he discussed different plans to achieve the westernization of Russia. Leibniz suggested an education reform which divided schools, universities, and academies, as well as creating new academies and schools. Also, Leibniz suggested creating an arts and sciences institution with faculty consisting of leading foreign scholars.

Following Leibniz&#x27;s advice, Peter founded the St. Petersburg Academy of Science a year before he died, in January 1724 and the Senate decree of February 8, 1724 implemented the academy. It was modeled after the centralized structure of the Paris Academy and the Berlin Academy of Sciences. These model institutions had led to an educated society of philosophical men, something Peter wanted in Russia. In particular, the Berlin Academy of Sciences was founded by Leibniz, exemplary of the influence which Leibniz had on the creation of the St Petersburg Academy of Science. The Paris Academy was administered directly by the King, which inspired Peter to make himself the supreme head of the St Petersburg Academy of Science, although there could be an academy president.

==== Early years of the Academy ====
Peter&#x27;s widow and Empress Catherine I followed through with the establishment and formation of the academy, opening it in December 1725. Mathematics, physical sciences, and humanities were the three departments which made up the academy upon its opening. The academy also contained a university and secondary school, promoting higher education in Russia. As such, the initial 17 scholars had to teach and administer research. They were a portion of the 84 Academy staff in 1726 There were also student assistants who helped the scholars and taught in the secondary school. 112 students ages 5–18 made up the total first year enrollment in 1726. 76 of the 112 students were Russian while the other 36 students were foreign. The academy did not have an official charter until 1747. Peter I did lay out the goals for the academy in a document signed before his death called the &quot;Project&quot;. In the document, Peter wished for the academy to be a model for Russia.

Since the academy was under the Tsar, the presidents, vice-presidents, directors, and vice-directors were all appointed by the crown. Catherine I started this precedent which lasted until the end of the Russian Empire. The academy hit hard times during Empress Anna&#x27;s rule. A low of 6 students remained in 1744 and the teaching was in German, contrary to Peter I&#x27;s wishes. The academy achieved a major goal in the 1740s by turning out the first Russian scholar members, Stepan Krasheninnikov and Mikhail Lomonosov.

==== Post-1747 Charter ====
The academy&#x27;s charter in 1747 brought some changed to the academy&#x27;s organization which stood until the end of the century. Among some of the changes were Russian and Latin as the official languages, a push to translate literature into Russian, and restrictive working hours for faculty. The charter also emphasized the hope for Russian Academy graduates to replace all the foreign scholars in time. Most of the secondary school graduates went into civil service instead of continue to the university. The university part of the academy gradually deteriorated and eventually died by 1767.

During Catherine the Great&#x27;s rule, she enacted reforms to improve the academy for scholars. She created a commission of academy faculty to lead the academy instead of bureaucratic rule. Also, in the second half of the 18th century, Russian scholars grew in number among the faculty of the academy. To heal the growing internal German versus Russian conflict of the faculty, Catherine the Great convinced Euler to return to St Petersburg and head the academy in 1766, where he stayed until he died in 1783. Catherine the Great&#x27;s son Paul I&#x27;s short reign marked a decline for the academy as he cut funding for academic institutions and prohibited Russians from attending Western influenced institutions. In 1803, Alexander I reverted to reforms from Catherine the Great&#x27;s era and gave the academy self-administration power in a new charter. The new charter came with a name change to the Imperial Academy of Sciences.

==== Scholars and research ====

Following Leibniz&#x27;s instructions, Peter reached out to the German philosopher Christian Wolff, a correspondent of Leibniz, in the early 1720s and unsuccessfully offered him the Vice-Presidency of the academy. While Wolff declined a position in the academy, he did invite western scholars to work at the academy to improve higher education within the Russian Empire as outlined in Leibniz&#x27;s letters. Foreign scholars invited to work at the academy included the mathematicians Leonhard Euler (1707–1783), Anders Johan Lexell, Christian Goldbach, Georg Bernhard Bilfinger, Nicholas Bernoulli (1695–1726) and Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782), botanist Johann Georg Gmelin, embryologists Caspar Friedrich Wolff, astronomer and geographer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle, physicist Georg Wolfgang Kraft, historian Gerhard Friedrich Müller and English Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne (1732–1811).

Expeditions to explore remote parts of the country had Academy scientists as their leaders or most active participants. These included Vitus Bering&#x27;s Second Kamchatka Expedition of 1733–1743, expeditions to observe the 1769 transit of Venus from eight locations in Russian Empire, and the expeditions of Peter Simon Pallas (1741–1811) to Siberia. The expeditions led to the creation of an atlas of Russia and to research in astronomy, geography, and fauna and flora. From 1750 to 1777, the academy published 20 volumes of their academic journal called &quot;Novi Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae&quot;. The majority of Russian scientific research in the 18th century was done by members of the academy.

==== Academy name changes ====
Originally called &quot;The Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences&quot; (), the organization went under various names over the years, becoming &quot;The Imperial Academy of Sciences and Arts&quot; (Императорская академия наук и художеств; 1747–1803), &quot;The Imperial Academy of Sciences&quot; (Императорская академия наук; 1803–1836), and finally, &quot;The Imperial Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences&quot; (Императорская Санкт-Петербургская академия Наук, from 1836 and until the end of the empire in 1917).

A separate organization, called the Russian Academy (), was created in 1783 to work on the study of the Russian language. Presided over by Princess Yekaterina Dashkova (who at the same time was the Director of the Imperial Academy of Arts and Sciences, i.e., the country&#x27;s &quot;main&quot; academy), the Russian Academy was engaged in compiling the six-volume &quot;Academic Dictionary of the Russian Language&quot; (1789–1794). The Russian Academy was merged into the Imperial Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1841.

=== In the Soviet Union ===
Shortly after the October Revolution, in December 1917, Sergey Fedorovich Oldenburg, a leading ethnographer and political activist in the Kadet party, met with Vladimir Lenin to discuss the future of the academy. They agreed that the expertise of the academy would be applied to addressing questions of state construction, while in return the Soviet government would give the academy financial and political support. 

The most important activities of the academy in the 1920s included an investigation of the large Kursk Magnetic Anomaly, of the minerals in the Kola Peninsula, and participation in the GOELRO plan targeted electrification of the whole country. In 1925 the Soviet government recognized the Russian Academy of Sciences as the &quot;highest all-Union scientific institution&quot; and renamed it the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. In 1934, the academy headquarters moved from Leningrad to the capital, Moscow. The Stalin years were marked by a rapid industrialisation of the Soviet Union for which a great deal of research, mainly in the technical fields, was done. However, on the other hand, in these very times, many scientists underwent repressions for ideological reasons.

In the years of the Second World War, the Soviet Academy of Sciences made a big contribution to a development of modern weapons – tanks (new series of T-34), airplanes, degaussing the ships (for protection against the naval mines) etc. – and therefore to victory of the USSR over Nazi Germany. During and after the war, the academy was involved in the Soviet atomic bomb project; due to its success and other achievements in military techniques, the USSR became one of the superpowers in the Cold War era.

At the end of the 1940s, the academy consisted of eight divisions (Physico-Mathematical Science, Chemical Sciences, Geological-Geographical Sciences, Biological Science, Technical Science, History and Philosophy, Economics and Law, Literature and Languages); three committees (one for coordinating the scientific work of the Academies of the Republics, one for scientific and technical propaganda, and one for editorial and publications), two commissions (for publishing popular scientific literature, and for museums and archives), a laboratory for scientific photography and cinematography and Academy of Science Press departments external to the divisions. 

The Academy of Sciences of the USSR helped to establish national Academies of Sciences in all Soviet republics (with the exception of the Russian SFSR), in many cases delegating prominent scientists to live and work in other republics. In the case of Ukraine, its academy was formed by the local Ukrainian scientists and prior to occupation of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic by Bolsheviks. These academies were:

Among the most important achievements of the academy of the second half of the 20th century, there is, first of all, the Soviet space program. In 1957 the first satellite was launched, in 1961 Yury Gagarin became the first person in space, and in 1971 the first space station Salyut 1 began its operation. Discoveries were also made in the nuclear branch and in other fields of physics. Furthermore, the academy participated in opening new universities or new study programs in the already existed universities, whose best absolvents started their career at the research institutes of the academy.

===Post-Soviet period===
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, by decree of the President of Russia of December 2, 1991, the academy again became the &quot;Russian Academy of Sciences&quot;, inheriting all facilities of the USSR Academy of Sciences in the territory of the Russian Federation. The crisis of the 1990s in the post-Soviet Russia and a consequent drastic reduction of the state support for science have forced many scientists to leave Russia for Europe, Israel or the United States. Some excellent university graduates who could have become promising researchers also switched to other activities, predominately in commerce. The Russian Academy practically lost a generation of people born from the mid-1960s to mid-1970s; this age category is now underrepresented in all research institutes. In the 2000s, the situation in the Russian science and technology has improved, the government announced a modernization campaign. Nevertheless, according to the Russian Academy of Sciences, total R&amp;D spending in 2013 still hovered about 40% below the pre-crisis 1990 levels. Furthermore, a lack of competition, decayed infrastructure and continuing, though slightly reduced, brain drain play their part.

=== Restructured academy 2013 and later ===

On June 28, 2013, the Russian Government announced a draft law that would dissolve the RAS while creating a new &quot;public-governmental&quot; organization with the same name. The RAS would be fused with two other Russian national academies— and Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, with all members of all academies acquiring equal status as academicians. The law also created a new government agency: (FASO). FASO would take control of all buildings and other property of the academy. In addition, all RAS academic institutes were removed from academy control. Instead, the new government agency FASO was empowered to &quot;evaluate&quot;, relying on its own criteria, the efficiency of research institutes and rearrange ineffective ones.

The draft law, which, in its initial form, would have fundamentally changed the system of science organization in Russia, provoked conflicts and protests within academic circles. A large group of the RAS members signalized their intention not to join the new academy if the reform is run as planned in the draft. Some leading scientists (including Pierre Deligne, Michael Atiyah, Mumford, and others) wrote open letters which referred to the planned reform of the RAS as &quot;shocking&quot; and even &quot;criminal&quot;. In this situation, the draft was softened in some details—e.g., there remained no words about &quot;dissolution&quot; in the text—and approved on September 27, 2013. In 2014, Putin announced more changes to science funding that reduced RAS power while increasing that of the government.

In 2017, the election of the RAS president was brought under government control. At the General Meeting of the RAS in March 2018, the RAS president (that time) Alexander Sergeev said that the academy enters now the post-reform period. In May 2018, the FASO was incorporated into Russia&#x27;s new Ministry of Science and Higher Education. The latter was created by splitting the Ministry of Education and Science. Mikhail Kotyukov, who had been head of FASO since its creation, was named head of the new Ministry of Science and Higher Education. In June 2023, the RAS opened the Modern Ideology of China Research Laboratory within its Institute of China and Contemporary Asia to study Xi Jinping Thought.

==Achievements==
===Social activities of the academy and its members===

Scientists of the academy were repeatedly elected deputies of various levels. In the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1974, &quot;among the deputies of the Council of the Union, there were 22 scientists from the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, the academies of sciences of the Union republics, and branch academies.&quot; In 1989, Andrei Sakharov became a People&#x27;s Deputy of the USSR. Many scientists have worked in the State Duma of the Russian Federation, among the most famous are the physicist Zhores Alferov (deputy from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation until his death on March 1, 2019, initiator of the laws &quot;On Education for All&quot; and &quot;On Support for Innovation in Russia&quot;), physician Gennady Onishchenko (from United Russia, member of the committee on education and science), and polar explorer Artur Chilingarov (United Russia).

<text>RatDog is an American rock band. The group began in 1995 as a side project for Grateful Dead guitarist and singer Bob Weir. After the Dead disbanded later that year, RatDog became Weir&#x27;s primary band. They performed some Grateful Dead songs, a mixture of covers (including Bob Dylan and Chuck Berry tunes), and some originals. They released two albums – &quot;Evening Moods&quot; (2000) and &quot;Live at Roseland&quot; (2001). RatDog has not toured since July 2014.

The lineup of RatDog evolved over time. Musicians who were members of the band at different times include Rob Wasserman and Robin Sylvester on bass, Jay Lane on drums, Matthew Kelly, Mark Karan, and Steve Kimock on guitar, and Vince Welnick, Johnny Johnson and Jeff Chimenti on keyboards.

==History==
During the late 1980s, Bob Weir teamed up with bassist Rob Wasserman and the duo toured for seven years under names such as Weir/Wasserman and Scaring the Children. In 1994, Weir and Wasserman participated in the Woodstock &#x27;94 festival. Jay Lane was added on drums and Matthew Kelly on guitar and harmonica in 1995. They played their first show as a full band on April 22, 1995, billed as Friends of Montezuma and then as RatDog Revue. They played their first show as RatDog on August 8, 1995. Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia died the next day.

RatDog went through a series of personnel changes from 1995 and 2000. Former Grateful Dead keyboardist Vince Welnick performed with the group in late 1995. Former Chuck Berry collaborator Johnnie Johnson performed with the group from February 1996 to May 1997 and was then replaced by Jeff Chimenti who has been with the band ever since. Keyboardist Mookie Siegel also played with the band between 1996 and 1997. Saxophonist Dave Ellis was a member of the group from 1996 until 1999 when he was replaced by Kenny Brooks in 2000 until his departure in 2012. Mark Karan joined on guitar in 1998 until his departure in 2012. Original stand up bassist Rob Wasserman was replaced by bass guitarist Robin Sylvester in 2003. Wasserman rejoined the band in January 2012 and played alongside Sylvester until the former&#x27;s death in June 2016. The lineup of Bob Weir (rhythm guitar, lead vocals), Jay Lane (drums, vocals), Jeff Chimenti (keyboards, vocals), Kenny Brooks (saxophone, vocals), Mark Karan (lead guitar, vocals) and Robin Sylvester (bass guitar, vocals) was the longest serving lineup of the band. They performed together for nine years from 2003 until 2012, with the exception of 2007 when Karan was replaced briefly by Steve Kimock to battle a health problem.

RatDog released their first and, to date, only studio album, &quot;Evening Moods&quot; in 2000. They released their only official live album &quot;Live at Roseland&quot; in 2001, although most of the soundboards from their concerts since the mid-2000s were made available for purchase after concerts and online.

Throughout 2009 and 2010, original RatDog members Bob Weir, Rob Wasserman and Jay Lane periodically performed under the moniker Scaring the Children. 

From 2010 through 2013, the number of RatDog&#x27;s performances were limited while Weir toured with Furthur. Ratdog played two shows in both January 2012 and August 2013. In September 2013 it was revealed by Primus bassist Les Claypool that RatDog would be &quot;getting back together this next year&quot;, as Lane had chosen to leave Primus in order to rejoin RatDog.

In February and March 2014, RatDog resumed more extensive touring, with Steve Kimock on lead guitar, Jeff Chimenti on keyboards, Jay Lane on drums, and two bass players, Robin Sylvester and Rob Wasserman. On August 10, 2014, Bob Weir and RatDog cancelled their summer and fall tour dates without explanation. Since early 2014 RatDog has been on hiatus while Bob Weir performs with Dead &amp; Company.

Original, and then-current, bassist Rob Wasserman died on June 29, 2016. On August 31, 2016, Weir reunited Ratdog for a special tribute to Wasserman, at the Sweetwater Music Hall in Mill Valley, California. Weir welcomed a number of guests to his show, including Steve Kimock, Mark Karan, Dave Ellis, Robin Sylvester, Jeff Chimenti and Jay Lane – all of whom were former and/or present members of RatDog. The band also welcomed Lukas Nelson and DJ Logic, who each sat in with the RatDog ensemble. The event marked the first time that guitarist Mark Karan and saxophonist Dave Ellis had played together in years. Both Karan and Ellis joined RatDog in the late 1990s, with Ellis leaving in 1999 and Karan staying on until 2012.

==Notable guests==
Since its formation, many guest musicians have performed with RatDog, including Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, Donna Jean Godchaux and Bruce Hornsby. Other well known guests include Joan Baez, Warren Haynes, Jimmy Herring, Derek Trucks, Al Schnier, Ekoostik Hookah, Trey Anastasio, Les Claypool, Pete Sears, DJ Logic, John Popper, Dickey Betts, Sammy Hagar, Mike Gordon and Keller Williams.

<doc id="374559" wikidata="Q353284" url="?curid=374559" title="Intellect">
<text>Intellect is a faculty of the human mind that enables reasoning, abstraction, conceptualization, and judgment. It enables the discernment of truth and falsehood, as well as higher-order thinking beyond immediate perception. Intellect is distinct from &quot;intelligence&quot;, which refers to the general ability to learn, adapt, and solve problems, whereas &quot;intellect&quot; concerns the application of reason to abstract or philosophical thought.

In philosophy, intellect ( (διάνοια)) has often been contrasted with (νοῦς), a Greek term referring to the faculty of direct intuitive knowledge. While intellect engages in discursive reasoning, breaking down concepts into logical sequences, &quot;nous&quot; is considered a higher cognitive faculty that allows for direct perception of truth, especially in Platonism and Neoplatonism. Aristotle distinguished between the active intellect (), which abstracts universal concepts, and the passive intellect, which receives sensory input.

During Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, the intellect was considered the bridge between the human soul and divine knowledge, particularly in religious and metaphysical contexts. Thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas and Averroes explored intellect as the means by which humans engage in higher reasoning and theological contemplation. This intellectual tradition influenced both Christian Scholasticism and Islamic philosophy, where intellect was linked to the understanding of divine truth.

In modern psychology and neuroscience, the term &quot;intellect&quot; is sometimes used to describe higher cognitive functions related to abstract thought and logical reasoning. However, contemporary research primarily focuses on general intelligence (g-factor) and cognitive abilities rather than intellect as a separate faculty. While theories such as Howard Gardner&#x27;s theory of multiple intelligences address diverse ways of processing information, they do not equate directly to historical or philosophical notions of intellect.

==Etymology and meanings==
In Platonism, &quot;dianoia&quot; (Greek: διάνοια) is the human cognitive capacity for, process of, or result of &quot;discursive reasoning&quot;, specifically about mathematical and technical subjects. It stands in contrast to the immediate, cognitive process of &quot;intuitive apprehension&quot; or &quot;noesis&quot; ().

=== Intellect and intelligence ===
As a branch of intelligence, intellect primarily concerns the logical and rational functions of the human mind, emphasizing factual knowledge and analytical reasoning. Additional to the functions of linear logic and the patterns of formal logic the intellect also processes the non-linear functions of fuzzy logic and dialectical logic.

Intellect and intelligence are contrasted by etymology; derived from the Latin present active participle , the term &quot;intelligence&quot; denotes &quot;to gather in between&quot;, whereas the term &quot;intellect&quot;, derived from the past participle of , denotes &quot;what has been gathered&quot;. Therefore, intelligence relates to the creation of new categories of understanding, based upon similarities and differences, while intellect relates to understanding existing categories.

== In psychology ==
A person&#x27;s intellectual understanding of reality derives from a conceptual model of reality based upon the perception and the cognition of the material world of reality. The conceptual model of &quot;mind&quot; is composed of the mental and emotional processes by which a person seeks, finds, and applies logical solutions to the problems of life. The full potential of the intellect is achieved when a person acquires a factually accurate understanding of the real world, which is mirrored in the mind. The mature intellect is identified by the person&#x27;s possessing the capability of emotional self-management, wherein they can encounter, face, and resolve problems of life without being overwhelmed by emotion.

Real-world experience is necessary to and for the development of a person&#x27;s intellect, because, in resolving the problems of life, a person can intellectually comprehend a social circumstance (a time and a place) and so adjust their social behavior in order to act appropriately in the society of other people. Intellect develops when a person seeks an emotionally satisfactory solution to a problem; mental development occurs from the person&#x27;s search for satisfactory solutions to the problems of life. Only experience of the real world can provide understanding of reality, which contributes to the person&#x27;s intellectual development.

=== Jung and the four cognitive functions ===
Carl Gustav Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist and founder of analytical psychology, offered a nuanced view of intellect and intuition within the human psyche. He acknowledged the importance of intellectual faculties for logical reasoning and understanding but cautioned against overreliance on intellect at the expense of other vital aspects of the psyche, such as intuition and emotion.

In &quot;Psychological Types&quot; (1923), Jung explored different modes of consciousness, including the role of intellect. He identified thinking as one of the primary psychological functions, which, when extraverted, is oriented by objective data and often recognized as the dominant mode in scientific and philosophical endeavors. He stated:

Jung also associated intellect with the thinking function in his model of psychological types. In contrast to feeling, sensation, and intuition, thinking relies on structured, rational cognition. While necessary for problem-solving and scientific inquiry, intellect alone cannot fully grasp the depths of the psyche or facilitate individuation—the process of becoming a whole and integrated self. He noted:

This distinction reflects an influence from Platonic thought, where &quot;dianoia&quot; (discursive reasoning) is differentiated from &quot;noesis&quot; (direct apprehension or intuition). Jung expanded upon this by integrating these concepts into his psychological framework, emphasizing that both intellect and intuition are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the self and the world. For Jung, intellect had its place but needed to be balanced with intuitive and symbolic thought.

=== Guilford and the structure of intellect ===
In 1956, the psychologist Joy Paul Guilford (1897–1987) proposed a Structural Intellect (SI) model in three dimensions: (i) Operations, (ii) Contents, and (iii) Products. Each parameter contains specific, discrete elements that are individually measured as autonomous units of the human mind. Intellectual operations are represented by cognition and memory, production (by divergent thinking and convergent thinking), and evaluation. Contents are figurative and symbolic, semantic and behavioral. Products are in units, classes, and relations, systems, transformations, and implications.

<text>Yarmouth is a town, port and civil parish in the west of the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England. The town is named for its location at the mouth of the small Western Yar river. The town grew near the river crossing, originally a ferry, which was replaced with a road bridge in 1863.

==History==
Yarmouth has been a settlement for over a thousand years, and is one of the earliest on the island. The first account of the settlement is in Æthelred the Unready&#x27;s record of the Danegeld tax of 991, when it was called Eremue, meaning &quot;muddy estuary&quot;. The Normans laid out the streets on a grid system, a plan which can still be seen today. It grew rapidly, being given its first charter as a town in 1135. The town became a parliamentary borough in the Middle Ages, and the Yarmouth constituency was represented by two members of Parliament until 1832.

Until the castle was built, raids by the French hurt the town; in 1544 it was reputed to have been burned down. Legend has it that the church bells were carried off to Cherbourg or Boulogne.

Yarmouth Castle was built in 1547, and is now in the care of English Heritage. It is effectively a gun platform, built by Henry VIII to fortify the Solent and protect against any attempted invasion of England.

For many years Yarmouth was the seat of the Governor of the Island. Yarmouth Town Hall was built in 1763.

In St. James&#x27;s Church, there is a monument to the 17th century admiral Sir Robert Holmes who was at Yarmouth. He obtained it in a raid on a French ship, when he seized an unfinished statue of Louis XIV of France and forced the sculptor to finish it with his own head rather than the king&#x27;s.

In 1784, most of Yarmouth&#x27;s ancient charters were lost: A ship&#x27;s captain, drunk after a court dinner, stole what he thought was a case of wine, as he returned to his ship. When he discovered it was a case of books, he threw it overboard.

Yarmouth Pier was opened in 1876. It received Grade 2 listed status in 1975. Originally 685 ft (207.5m) long, it&#x27;s now 609 ft (186m) but is still the longest timber pier in England open to the public, and also a docking point for the MV Balmoral and PS Waverley.

Several Sites of Special Scientific Interest lie close to Yarmouth, including Yar Estuary SSSI &amp; Bouldnor And Hamstead Cliffs SSSI.

==Commerce==
As a port and market town Yarmouth has had local commercial significance. It still has some boat yards and chandlery, and although relatively small it still supports a number of shops, hotels, pubs and restaurants, supported partly by passing trade from the ferry terminal and visiting boat owners.

==Transport==

The Wightlink car ferry sails from Yarmouth to Lymington (Lymington Pier) in Hampshire.

Southern Vectis operate bus services from Yarmouth bus station, a small building near the ferry terminal, the main route being route 7 serving Totland, Alum Bay, Freshwater, Newport and Shalfleet as well as Yarmouth. To reach Yarmouth, route 7 uses Pixley Hill, which has caused some controversy amongst local residents who do not believe the road is large enough for buses. The controversy was initially started by former route 11 being extended to serve Yarmouth and using the lane in September 2008.

In the spring and summer, Southern Vectis also operate an open top bus called &quot;The Needles Breezer&quot; that runs through Freshwater Bay to Alum Bay and onto the Needles Battery down a bus and pedestrian-only road along the cliff edge; returning to Yarmouth via Totland and Colwell. For the more athletic, Yarmouth is on the Isle of Wight Coastal Path.

The parish was once served by Yarmouth railway station, with services to Newport. Passenger services ended in 1953, and the track has long since been removed; the trackbed between Yarmouth and Freshwater has been converted into a bridleway. In August 2014 the converted and expanded railway station opened as a restaurant.

==Size and population==
Yarmouth is one of the smallest towns in the United Kingdom. The 2011 census reported the parish of Yarmouth having 865 usual residents. In 2001, the population was just 791 (compared with about 600 at the beginning of the 19th century).

==Today==
Yarmouth hosted the popular biannual Old Gaffers festival which included several days of entertainment and shows, but in September 2018 it was announced that the event would no longer be held.

Yarmouth marina is the landing point for the Royal Navy&#x27;s Solent Amphibious Challenge, held in June each year.

<doc id="374570" wikidata="Q3303273" url="?curid=374570" title="Malto Brewery">
<text>Malto Brewery is the largest brewery in Albania. The company sells a pilsener beer under the [[Birra Tirana]] brand, named after the capital, Tirana, where the beers are brewed. It was first produced in 1961 by the &quot;Kombinati Ushqimor&quot; (a state agency). The beer contains 4% alcohol.

Malto Brewery was privatized in 2001. The company used to produce 5,000 tons a year prior to the privatization, while it is currently producing around 13,000 tons, with exports going to Kosovo and the United States. Birra Tirana accounts for a large percentage of all beers sold in Albania, up to 30% by some accounts, making it one of the most widely distributed products made in Albania.

==History==
The production of the beer in Albania began in 1938, with a capacity around 8,000 HL in year. In these years the beer was known only a little bit by Albanians, because the traditional drinks were wine and brandy. After the Second World War, Albania began to build the grocery industry, which was imported generally from the countries of ex-socialist camp. In 1960 Birra Tirana was constructed as a factory with capacity 70,000 HL/year, with a Russian production technology and the first specialists were qualified in the Soviet Union. It produced beer of the type blond pilsen and dark one in 0.5L bottles in woody case and 50L butt. Birra Tirana has been a component part of ex-Grocery Combine &quot;Ali Kelmendi&quot;. Together with the beer factory, a malt production facility was built, which until 1983, provided malt to the beer factory. Barley was produced primarily in the zone of Korca, while Hops were cultivated in Pogradec. The water used for the production of the beer has always been from the Selitas fountains. As a result of the increased market demand for beer, in 1983, Birra Tirana was reconstructed, increasing its capacity to 150,000 HL/year. Technology was improved with the addition of German and Swedish machinery.

Inasmuch as, in this period, there was a centralized economy, Birra Tirana was distributed in 2/3 of the country, except the south-east part of Albania, that was furnished by Birra Korça. After the year 1983, around 50 percent of malt began to be imported. Together with the change in the political climate, including the liberalization of the market, different beers were imported from neighboring countries. As result of the image of these products as well as economic downturn, political and social chaos, the production and the sales in 1990–1992, fell by 4 percent.
As result of the reform of economic decentralization, that the Albania Government undertook, the grocery combine &quot;Ali Kelmendi&quot; was disintegrated in some separately establishments and the factory of Birra Tirana, passed as an independent establishment, with distinctive balance, registering under the name The establishment of the Production of Birra Malty, but the product&#x27;s brand did not change. In 1993, with the grant of BE, via the Phare programme, were claimed 1,000,000 ECU, for the furniture with raw material (malt, hops), packages (bottles, cases), and also exchanges for the brush up to work of this factory. Birra Tirana began to compete successfully in market and its financial condition began to improve, creating such incomes, that not only liquidate in the state budget the fund about 100,000 ECU, but even accomplishing further investments with machinery in Germany, for the filling line, packing, grinding, CO2 gas, filtration, furnaces, compressors for refrigeration, and even the lines of circulation of the beer and brine, all in steel.
In this period was paid a special attention to the Marketing and to the analysis of the market in particular, with the help of the English specialists, Dutch and German. In base of this analysis, Birra Tirana created its strategy, improving evidently the image in market, via packing, publicity and promotion improvement, the enlargement of the distribution canal all over Albania, even competing with lower prices than import.
Also the security standard was increased for the consumers, growing the long-life of this beer six months to one year via tunnel pasteurization. The establishment of the production of Malt Beer, passed in Albania with limited liability (Sh.p.k). Meanwhile, in 2000, it returned in shareholder Fellowship &quot;Birra Malt&quot; Sh.a, with the capital 100% state-owned. This was a step forward its denationalization. 
It can be said that, in the attended strategy by Albanian State against Birra Tirana, won the idea that the denationalization of the establishments in Albania would be more efficient, putting them in efficiency and not destroying them.
In April 2001, &quot;Birra Malt&quot; Sh.a was denationalized by ten Albanians shareholders who have 96 percent of the shares, 2% the owner of the terrain and 2% of the workers. With its reorganization, and the breath, that brought the ten main shareholders, which had a long successful experience with their business, about the alteration of the work mentality and all these followed by business plans and by clear strategy of development, &quot;Birra Tirana&quot; has stated its goal to become the main beer in the Albania market. It is not traded only in Albania, but in Kosovo and America. This leap as consequence of the enlargement of the dimensions of the market, escaping the geographic confines of a strictly Albanian market, abandoning the idea that the market of Birra Tirana should be only Albanian.

<text>Bolesław IV the Curly (; 1122 – 5 January 1173), a member of the Piast dynasty, was Duke of Masovia from 1138 and High Duke of Poland from 1146 until his death in 1173.

==Early life==
Bolesław was the third son of Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth of Poland by his second wife Salomea of Berg. The death of his older brothers, Leszek and Casimir, before 1131 and in October 1131, respectively, left him as the eldest son of their parents. Bolesław was 13 years old at the time of his father&#x27;s death (1138) and of the legal age to take on the government of the lands he inherited according to his father&#x27;s testament, the newly created Duchy of Masovia (composed of Masovia and eastern Kuyavia).

In the first years of his government, young Bolesław remained under the strong influence of his mother and Voivode Wszebor, who feared the ambition of his elder half-brother High Duke Władysław II. Władysław II tried to restore the unity of the country and deposed the junior dukes.

==Fraternal struggle==
Trouble began openly in 1141, when Dowager Duchess Salomea — without the consent of High Duke Władysław II — organized a meeting with her sons at her residence in Łęczyca. Here was decided the betrothal of her youngest daughter, Agnes, to Mstislav II of Kiev, in order to gain allies in a possible conflict. She also set up the division of the Łęczyca lands, her dower, between her sons upon her death. The junior dukes in this first struggle were definitely defeated, because Grand Prince Vsevolod II of Kiev decided to make an alliance with Władysław II, reinforced by the marriage of Vsevolod&#x27;s daughter Zvenislava with the high duke&#x27;s eldest son, Bolesław the Tall. An additional humiliation for Bolesław IV and his brothers was that they were sent by the high duke on an expedition to the Kievan Rus&#x27; as ambassadors during 1142–1143.

The &quot;peace&quot; lasted only two years until 1144 when, after Salomea&#x27;s death and according to Bolesław III&#x27;s Testament, the Łęczyca province reverted to the Seniorate Province of High Duke Władysław II. The idea to reserve the lands for his younger brothers Henry and Casimir II was not popular with Wladyslaw, who thought that the land was only temporarily separated from his &quot;Dzielnica senioralna&quot; and now in its entirety should be returned. The outbreak of civil war was therefore only a matter of time.

The war erupted with full force in 1145, and it seemed that the junior dukes were defeated and the high duke finally achieved the unification of the country. At first the combined forces of Bolesław IV and his brothers prevented the disaster and demanded a hasty reorganization of the forces of Władysław at the Battle on the Pilicą River. The major significance of this battle was to the former voivode Wszebor, whose military experience far exceeded the ability of Władysław&#x27;s commanders. Soon, however, the situation was totally reversed as a result of the Kievan troops who entered in the country as Władysław&#x27;s allies. Bolesław then had to agree to step down and renounce any pretension over the lands belonging to his mother.

The concessions of the junior dukes ultimately didn&#x27;t resolve the problem. Moreover, Władysław&#x27;s confidence in his forces had him embark on a final solution, the removal of his stepbrothers from their lands. Suddenly, the junior dukes could rely on the support of the high duke&#x27;s all-powerful voivode Piotr Włostowic, for whom Władysław&#x27;s plans were too radical and threatened to weaken his position. While Władysław opted for a quick response against him (the voivode was blinded and muted), forcing Włostowic to go to Kiev, the high duke&#x27;s final decision on his confrontation with the voivode considerably weakened his position. What&#x27;s more, Włostowic convinced the Kievans to break his alliance with Władysław.

==Expulsion of Władysław II==
At the beginning of 1146 the rebellions against Władysław&#x27;s government rose mighty, sparked by the fate of Piotr Włostowic. Nevertheless, the final victory of Władysław seemed likely, especially after the conquest of Masovia (forcing Bolesław to escape) and the siege of Poznań in Greater Poland in the spring of 1146. However, thanks to the rebellion in Władysław&#x27;s own lands, and the excommunication imposed to him by the Archbishop of Gniezno, the high duke suffered an unexpected defeat. Władysław and his family had to flee across the border with the Holy Roman Empire, at first to Bohemia and later to Germany, accommodated by King Conrad III.

The junior dukes reassigned the Polish provinces between them. The Duchy of Silesia and the Seniorate Province at Kraków were taken by Bolesław, who also received the title of high duke, the western Duchy of Greater Poland was retained by his brother Mieszko III, and Henry finally received his long-promised land of Sandomierz. Casimir II, the youngest brother, again remained without lands.

== Interventions==
Thanks to the intrigues of his wife, Agnes of Babenberg, a half-sister of King Conrad III, Władysław II succeeded in convincing his brother-in-law to make a military expedition to Poland. The hastily organized expedition however clashed with the reluctance of the former subjects of the deposed high duke, and was finally defeated already on the Polish border near the Oder river in August 1146.

In subsequent years, Bolesław IV along with his younger brothers bellows sought to maintain good relations with the royal House of Hohenstaufen, Władysław&#x27;s allies. To this end, in 1148 the junior dukes organized a meeting in Kruszwica, to which they invited the warlike Margrave Albert the Bear of the German Northern March (the later Margraviate of Brandenburg), who had reached the Polish border in the course of the Wendish Crusade. There, Bolesław arranged the marriage of his sister Judith with the margrave&#x27;s son Otto. Boleslaw and Mieszko also militarily supported the Germans in the fight against the reluctant West Slavic Lutici tribes, considerably contributing to the stability of German domination over the middle Spree region. The second important ally of the Piast prince was the Wettin margrave Konrad of Meissen.

Initially, Bolesław also had a difficult relationship with another opposing force policy like the Hohenstaufens: the Roman Curia under of Pope Eugene III. At first in 1147 the Papal legate Humbold recognized Bolesław as the new high duke and overlord of Poland. However, one year later, and again instigated by the intrigues of Władysław&#x27;s wife Agnes, the newly Papal legate Guy arrived to the country in connection with the refusal to restore the former high duke, and declared the ban over Poland. The penalty, thanks for the cohesive support of the Polish church hierarchy by the junior dukes, was virtually without repercussions.

Things worsened for Bolesław in 1157, when King Conrad&#x27;s nephew Frederick Barbarossa, crowned emperor by Pope Adrian IV in 1155, decided to make a new expedition to Poland, thanks to the ongoing pressures by his aunt Agnes, Władysław&#x27;s wife. This time the campaign was well organized, and the Emperor was well determined to force Bolesław IV to accept his own conditions. It&#x27;s unknown why Bolesław opted for a highly security tactics of war, not defending the swampy areas in front of the middle Oder river, which was for centuries the natural defense of Poland, nor the strongholds of Głogów and Bytom in Silesia. The Imperial army quickly advanced and soon laid siege to Poznan.

Given the difficult situation, Bolesław was forced to accept the humiliating negotiations and in a shameful ceremony on 30 August 1157, was declared a vassal of the Empire at his camp in Krzyszkowo. Bolesław was in his knees and beg for forgiveness to the Emperor, in return for which he kindly received from Barbarossa the further control over the Polish lands; also, he had to pay an enormous tribute to Emperor. For unknown reasons however, despite Barbarossa&#x27;s victory, Władysław II to his great disappointment was not restored in the Polish throne. Bolesław formally swore loyalty to the Emperor on Christmas Day in Magdeburg, and gave his younger brother, Casimir II, as a hostage. Two years later Władysław died in exile, having never returned to his country again.

Not before 1163 the sons of the late Władysław, Bolesław I the Tall and Mieszko IV Tanglefoot, backed by the Emperor insisting on the agreement made with Bolesław IV, were restored in their Silesia heritage; but this return didn&#x27;t affect the power of Bolesław as a high duke. Thanks to its German affinities, the senior branch of the Silesian Piasts at least managed to retain its Silesian lands (Wrocław, Legnica, Głogów, Opole and Racibórz) without problems.

==Crusade against the Prussians==
Following the defeat by the German forces, Bolesław initiated a bold plan for the conquest of the pagan Prussians, settling beyond the northeastern Polish border along the Baltic coast. This concept of an early Prussian Crusade was conceived in view of the repeated seizures by more and more Baltic tribes in the several districts of Bolesław&#x27;s Masovian province. The high duke proclaimed a crusade against the pagans and pressured the collaboration of both the pope and the Emperor. The initial campaigns were successful however efforts and attempts to conquer these province were finally defeated in 1166. Furthermore, during one of the battles the younger brother of the high duke, Henry of Sandomierz, was killed.

==Rebellion of Casimir the Just==
After Henry&#x27;s death, against the dispositions of the Bolesław III&#x27;s Testament, the high duke incorporated Sandomierz into the Seniorate Province. This caused the anger and frustration of his youngest brother, Casimir II the Just, who was the next in line to inherit the lands and was the only of Bolesław III&#x27; sons still without any land.

Casimir was supported in his rebellion by his elder brother Duke Mieszko III the Old of Greater Poland, the magnate Jaksa of Miechów and Sviatoslav, son of Voivode Piotr Włostowic, as well as the Archbishops of Gniezno and Kraków; also, almost all Lesser Polish nobility was on his side. In February 1168 the rebels gathered in Jędrzejów, and there they proclaimed Mieszko III as the new high duke and Casimir was formally invested with Sandomierz. But at the end Bolesław maintained his rule by largely accepting the demands of rebels; he divided late Henry&#x27;s duchy in three parts: the lands of Wiślica were granted to Casimir, Bolesław himself obtained Sandomierz proper and the rest passed to Mieszko III.

After the disaster of the Prussian Crusade, the Silesian dukes Bolesław I the Tall and Mieszko IV Tanglefoot attempted to dethrone the high duke and to recover the Seniorate Province and thereby the Polish overlordship. Bolesław&#x27;s reprisal expedition in the following year ended with a total disaster, so the high duke eventually had to reconcile with his Silesian nephews.

In 1172 Duke Mieszko III rebelled again; this time supporting his grandnephew Jarosław of Opole (the eldest son of Bolesław I the Tall), who, forced to become a priest in his early years, was barred from the Silesian succession. Unsatisfied with this, Jarosław tried to gain power and obtain his own lands. The support of this rebellion was so strong, that his father was forced to escape to Erfurt. This originated another expedition in his aid by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who again invaded Poland and defeated the rebels. The high duke ordered Mieszko III to Magdeburg where peace was made with the Empire after the payment of 8,000 pieces of silver and the Silesian duchy was again granted to Bolesław I the Tall at the Emperor&#x27;s mercy; despite his victory, the high duke finally accepted the autonomy of his Silesian nephews.

Shortly afterwards another rebellion took place, this time of the Lesser Polish nobles, who were extremely dissatisfied with the harsh and dictatorial high duke&#x27;s government. The rebels invited Casimir II, then duke of Wiślica, to take the Kraków throne, but Bolesław&#x27;s resistance against his younger brother was so strong that both parties made concessions, who led finished with any riots until the end of the high duke&#x27;s reign. Casimir succeeded Bolesław in Sandomierz upon his death in 1173 and became high duke four years later.

==Relations with the Church==
Bolesław was known for his many gifts and grants to the Church. Particularly enriched thanks to him, among others were: the Church of St. Mary and St. Catherine and of St. Vincent near Wrocław, the Benedictine monastery in Trzemeszno and the Collegiate church in Tum near Łęczyca. Around 1151 he founded the Canonical Regular Kolegiata in Czerwińsk.

==Marriages and issue==
In 1137 Bolesław married Viacheslava (b. ca. 1125 – d. 15 March ca. 1162?), daughter of Prince Vsevolod Mstislavich of Novgorod and Pskov. They had three children:
#Bolesław (b. 1156 – d. 1172)
#A daughter (b. ca. 1160 – d. aft. 1178), married ca. 1172/73 to Vasilko Iaropolkovich, Prince of Shumsk and Dorohychyn.
#Leszek (b. ca. 1162 – d. 1186).

After the death of his first wife, Bolesław married Maria (d. aft. 1173), whose origins are disputed. This union was childless.

Bolesław&#x27;s eldest son died in 1172 aged sixteen and reportedly the high duke was devastated by his death. He was succeeded in the Masovian-Kujavian principality by his second and only surviving son Leszek, at the age of eleven or less. As overlord and holder of Kraków and Gniezno, he however was succeeded by his next brother Mieszko III the Old.

<text>The gudok (, ), gudochek (, ) is an ancient Eastern Slavic string musical instrument, played with a bow.

A &quot;gudok&quot; usually had three strings, two of them tuned in unison and played as a drone, the third tuned a fifth higher. All three strings were in the same plane at the bridge, so that a bow could make them all sound simultaneously. Sometimes the gudok also had several sympathetic strings (up to eight) under the sounding board. These made the gudok&#x27;s sound warm and rich.

The player held the gudok on his lap, like a cello or viola da gamba. It was also possible to play the gudok while standing and even while dancing, which made it popular among skomorokhs. Initially in the 12th century (and probably before), the gudok did not have a neck for pressing strings. This suggests that it was played by stopping the strings from the side with fingernails (similarly to the Byzantine lyra), rather than pressing strings onto the instrument&#x27;s neck. Later in the 14th century some modifications of the gudok had a real neck for pressing strings.

The Russian gudok ceased to exist as a folk instrument for several centuries. All present instruments are replicas, based on several parts of gudoks found in the Novgorod excavations.

There have been several attempts to revive the gudok in music. Borodin&#x27;s opera &quot;Prince Igor&quot; contains a &quot;Gudok Player&#x27;s Song&quot;, which is an artistic reconstruction of how the gudok may have sounded.

<text>John Mercer Johnson (October 1818 – November 8, 1868) was a Canadian lawyer and politician from the Province of New Brunswick, and a Father of Confederation. He represented Northumberland in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1850 to 1865, and again from 1866 to 1867, each time elected as a candidate aligned with the liberal movement. Johnson was appointed to the Executive Council of New Brunswick and became the province&#x27;s solicitor general, postmaster, minister without portfolio and attorney general. He attended all three conferences for Canadian Confederation and supported Canada&#x27;s creation. In the first parliament for the country of Canada, Johnson was elected to represent Northumberland, serving in the role from 1867 to 1868 as a Liberal member. Plaques have been erected in his honour in Chatham, his hometown, and a mountain in Northumberland county was named for him.

==Early life and education==

Johnson was born in Liverpool, England, in October 1818. His father was also named John Mercer Johnson, and he was a merchant and public official in Chatham, New Brunswick; his mother was named Ellen. The younger Johnson emigrated to Chatham, New Brunswick, in 1821. He studied at Northumberland County Grammar School, then in the law office of John Ambrose Street. In 1837, he became the secretary of the Young Men&#x27;s Debating Society in Chatham. He became an attorney on October 13, 1838, and a barrister in October 1840.

==Legal career==

In 1840, Johnson opened a law office in Chatham and joined a professional partnership with C. A. Harding, but the partnership ended two years later. In 1842 he became the second lieutenant of the 1st Battalion of New Brunswick Rifle Company. In 1846, he became the secretary of the Chatham Mechanics&#x27; institute and lectured on phrenology, a belief that bumps on the skull can predict mental traits. In October 1847, he joined a legal partnership with Peter Mitchell, which ended in 1852 when Mitchell wanted to pursue a business in lumbering and shipbuilding. In 1851, he donated land for the construction of a temperance hall.

==New Brunswick politics==

On July 22, 1850, Johnson was elected to the New Brunswick assembly as one of the representatives from Northumberland. The assembly was non-partisan but Johnson was considered a liberal candidate and campaigned on implementing responsible government. He won his reelection on June 20, 1854. Under the premiership of Charles Fisher, Johnson was appointed to the Executive Council of New Brunswick on October 31, 1854, and became the province&#x27;s solicitor general. This council, which included Johnson, Samuel Leonard Tilley, John William Ritchie and William Steeves, became known as the Smashers administration. He was reelected in the election on June 27, 1856, but was not reappointed to the council when a conservative government won the majority of seats in the New Brunswick assembly. He was reelected on May 5, 1857, and returned to the executive council on June 1, 1857, as postmaster general. Johnson was uninterested in running the department, leaving administrative tasks to the clerks. This led to a chaotic ministry and his opponents accused him of collecting a salary without doing the work his office required. He resigned from this position in November 1858 and remained on the colony&#x27;s executive council as a minister without portfolio.

On February 11, 1859, Johnson was elected as the speaker of the New Brunswick assembly and resigned from the council. In 1860 he was appointed as a judge for the Inferior Court of Common Pleas and became captain of the revived 1st Battalion, which became known as the Chatham Rifles. In 1862 he became a trustee of the County Grammar School. He was re-elected as the assembly&#x27;s speaker on February 12, 1862, but resigned later that year when he was appointed to be the attorney general under the premiership of Tilley. He won a subsequent election for his seat, caused by accepting a position as a minister. He remained the attorney general until 1865.

===Canadian confederation===

 Johnson represented New Brunswick at the Charlottetown Conference and the Quebec Conference in 1864 to discuss the merger of the eastern British colonies of North America into a confederation of Canada. His participation in these conferences gives him the status of a Father of Confederation in Canada. In the Charlottetown Conference, he favoured a legislative union of the colonies and suggested that provinces might be dissolved or merged. He suggested that Prince Edward Island merge with New Brunswick, which irritated the other delegates at the conference and was rejected.

He changed his mind before the Quebec Conference and thought the legislative union would be impractical. In the Quebec conference, he supported a strong, centralised federal government that would have control of the court system. His argument followed social contract ideas, where the provinces should forfeit some of their national rights as individual provinces to create a better society. Other delegates disagreed with him and wanted more provincial control of the courts. This led to a compromise where the federal government enacts criminal laws and appoints county judges, while the provinces enact civil laws and administer the courts.

He was defeated in the re-election for his seat on March 18, 1865, by an anti-confederation candidate. He won the subsequent election for his Northumberland seat on May 25, 1866. He continued advocating for the Canadian confederation, and encouraged the British colonies to remove their provincial identities and unite under a single Canadian federal government. He stated his belief that the American Civil War was caused by a weak central government. He also believed that if Canada adopted an American model of government they would either eventually merge with America or become a republic. His goal was to maintain Canada&#x27;s connection to Britain, declaring that British institutions were more democratic than American ones. He also opposed the establishment of a judicial system that could override the other branches of government; if the rights of local governments were interfered with by federal law, the government could appeal to the British parliament. His belief was that parliament reflected citizens&#x27; political opinions, instead of each parliamentarian just representing their constituencies, and that referendums were not required to change the constitution of Canada or to enact new policies.

He attended the London Conference of 1866, making him one of eleven Fathers of Confederation to have attended all three conferences that led to the establishment of the Constitution Act, 1867. While in London he entertained the other members and the public with poetry presentations and ice-skating performances. He resigned from the New Brunswick assembly in June 1867 to run for the Canadian legislature.

==Canadian politics==

On September 4, 1867, Johnson was elected as the first representative for Northumberland in the Canadian House of Commons as part of the Liberal Party of Canada. He defeated Thomas F. Gillespie in the election. Johnson and Peter Mitchell were given the moniker &quot;the Northumberland County Smashers&quot; for their work in representing Miramichi, one of the cities in Johnson&#x27;s Northumberland constituency.

==Personal life and death==

On October 9, 1845, he married Henrietta Shirreff; they had twelve children, of which six children survived into adulthood. Their children included Ada E. Johnson, a teacher and organist, Andrew H., a lawyer, and Edward, who ran a stationery business in Chatham.

Johnson&#x27;s health deteriorated for more than a year before he became seriously ill in September 1868, and died in his home in Chatham on November 8, 1868. The cause of death was a buildup of fluid in the stomach, blamed on &quot;social excess&quot;. This might refer to Johnson&#x27;s alleged excessive drinking and gambling habits. He was buried at St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church in Chatham.

==In memoriam==

A plaque was placed in 1927 for Johnson&#x27;s honour at St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Chatham by the Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire. In the 1940s, a bronze plaque was installed on the post office in Chatham dedicated to Johnson. A street is named after him in the Chatham neighbourhood. In 1964, the provincial names authority named Mount Johnson, a mountain south of Nepisiguit River in New Brunswick, after Johnson, and the Order in Council for the mountain&#x27;s name took effect on September 1, 1964, in honour of the 100th anniversary of the New Brunswick delegates arrival to the Charlottetown Conference.

<text>John Scott Morris (born May 16, 1955) is an American former professional baseball starting pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1977 and 1994, mainly for the Detroit Tigers. Morris won 254 games throughout his career.

Armed with a fastball, a slider, and a forkball, Morris was a five-time All-Star (1981, 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1991), and played on three World Series Championship teams (1984 Tigers, 1991 Minnesota Twins, and 1992 Toronto Blue Jays). He went 3–0 in the 1984 postseason with two complete-game victories in the 1984 World Series, and 4–0 in the 1991 postseason with a ten-inning complete-game victory in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series. Morris won the Babe Ruth Award in both 1984 and 1991, and was named World Series MVP in 1991. While he gave up the most hits, most earned runs, and most home runs of any pitcher in the 1980s, he also started the most games, pitched the most innings, and had the most wins of any pitcher in that decade. He is one of ten players in MLB history to have won back-to back World Series championships on different teams, with the other nine being Allie Clark, Clem Labine, Bill Skowron, Don Gullett, Ryan Theriot, Jake Peavy, Ben Zobrist, Joc Pederson, and Will Smith.

Since retiring as a player, Morris has worked as a broadcast color analyst for the Blue Jays, Twins, and Tigers. He has also been an analyst for MLB broadcasts on Fox Sports 1. Morris was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2018. Morris has the highest career ERA among pitchers in the Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==
===Amateur career===
Morris attended Highland Park High School in Saint Paul, Minnesota, graduating in 1973. He then attended Brigham Young University (BYU), and played college baseball for the BYU Cougars.

===Detroit Tigers===
The Detroit Tigers selected Morris in the fifth round of the 1976 MLB draft. He was first called up to the Tigers in 1977 after Mark Fidrych was placed on the disabled list with an injury. Morris broke into the Tigers&#x27; starting rotation in 1979, posting a 17–7 record and a 3.29 ERA and establishing himself as the ace of the Detroit staff. Morris, along with catcher Lance Parrish, shortstop Alan Trammell, second baseman Lou Whitaker, outfielder Kirk Gibson, and manager Sparky Anderson, played a notable role in turning the Tigers into a contending team for most of the 1980s. In 1980, Morris learned to throw the split-finger fastball from newly hired pitching coach Roger Craig, and it became an effective pitch for the rest of Morris&#x27; career. He led the major leagues with 14 wins in the strike-shortened 1981 season, while posting a 3.05 ERA.

Despite playing for the notorious &quot;Captain Hook&quot; (Anderson), nicknamed because of his tendency to pull his starters at the first sign of weakness, Morris was known for finishing games. He racked up 175 complete games in his career (154 with Detroit). He compiled double-digit complete game totals in 10 of his 12 full seasons as a Tiger. In 1983, Morris completed 20 of his 37 starts. That year, he led the league in innings pitched (293.2), batters faced (1204) and strikeouts (232), while posting his first 20-win season.

On April 7, 1984 (on NBC&#x27;s nationally televised &quot;Game of the Week&quot;), Morris no-hit the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park, beginning what would be an excellent season for both him and the Tigers. The no-hitter was the first by a Tiger since Jim Bunning in 1958. By the end of the 1984 campaign, he had notched 19 wins and a 3.60 ERA, leading Detroit into the postseason. He scored a win over the Kansas City Royals in the ALCS, and added two more complete-game victories in the World Series against the San Diego Padres as the Tigers concluded their wire-to-wire 1984 campaign with the World Championship. While teammate Alan Trammell was named World Series MVP, Morris was given the Babe Ruth Award for most outstanding performance in the 1984 postseason.

In 1986, Morris went 21–8 with a 3.27 ERA and 223 strikeouts. His career-high six shutouts that season included a stretch from July 9–18 in which he threw a complete-game shutout in three consecutive starts. The Tigers headed to the postseason again in 1987 behind a team-leading 18 wins from Morris, but this time Morris&#x27; postseason performance was below expectations. He lost his only start in the ALCS, surrendering six runs in eight innings to the eventual World Champion Minnesota Twins. Despite a sub-par season in 1989 when he made only 24 starts and won just 6 games, he finished the 1980s with 162 wins, the most by a major league pitcher during the decade. In 1990, his final season in Detroit, Morris lost a career-high 18 games, though he also led the Tiger staff with 15 wins and led the AL with 11 complete games.

Morris had a 3–1 post-season record as a Tiger, with a 2.73 ERA.

===Minnesota Twins===
In 1991, Morris signed a one-year contract with his hometown Minnesota Twins. He enjoyed another great season, posting 18 wins with a 3.43 ERA, and an even better postseason after Minnesota won the AL West. Morris won both of his starts over the Toronto Blue Jays in the ALCS, and his team went on to face the Atlanta Braves in the World Series. Morris started for the Twins three times in the series, going 2–0 with a 1.17 ERA, making his final outing in the deciding Game 7. In a postseason performance for the ages, the 36-year-old hurler threw 10 innings of shutout baseball against the Braves, as the Twins won the game 1–0 on a 10th-inning single by Gene Larkin that scored Dan Gladden. Morris was named the World Series MVP for his performance, and joined fellow pitcher Sandy Koufax as the only players to win the Babe Ruth Award twice. He holds the record for most wins by a Twin in a single postseason, with four in 1991.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
Following the 1991 season, Morris signed a two-year contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. In the 1992 season, he earned 21 wins for the second time in his career (the first ever 20-win season for a Blue Jays pitcher) with only six losses, though he rode a wave of superior run support from his offense, given his 4.04 ERA that year. The Blue Jays reached the 1992 World Series against the Braves. Despite a subpar post-season performance (he went 0–3, including two World Series losses), Morris won a third World Series ring as Toronto beat Atlanta in six games. He won a fourth ring in 1993, as the Blue Jays repeated as World Champions with a victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in six games. However, Morris was not a factor in the Blue Jays World Series repeat: he pitched poorly for the team in the regular season, finishing 7–12 with a 6.19 ERA, and was not used at all in the postseason due to a season-ending injury.

On April 6, 1993, Morris set a major league record by making his 14th consecutive Opening Day start, becoming the fourth pitcher to make fourteen Opening Day starts to go with being the first (and so far only) pitcher to start the first game of a season in fourteen consecutive seasons.

===Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds===
Morris joined the Cleveland Indians in 1994, but was released by the team on August 9, three days before the season was ended by a strike. Morris finished the season with a 10–6 record and an ERA of 5.60. He signed a one-year, $600,000 contract with the Cincinnati Reds on December 22, 1994. After an abortive attempt at a comeback with the Reds during spring training of 1995, Morris retired. In 1996, he made a brief return to professional baseball, this time playing with his hometown St. Paul Saints of the independent Northern League. The 41-year-old Morris went 5–1 in 10 starts, with a 2.69 ERA, before retiring for good.

===Salary===
Morris was the highest-paid pitcher in the American League on at least four occasions: 1987, 1988, 1991, and 1993.

===Wildness===
The split-finger pitch was responsible for Morris leading the league in wild pitches on six separate occasions. His 206 wild pitches in his career rank thirteenth in baseball history (tied with Adonis Terry) and third highest among pitchers who pitched their entire careers in the live-ball era. (Only Nolan Ryan with 277 and Phil Niekro with 226 rank higher than Morris.)

==Post-career activities==
Morris has spent time as a color analyst for the Minnesota Twins. He also spent time in Lakeland, Florida, as a part-time coach for the Detroit Tigers during spring training.

In 2013, Morris joined Sportsnet as a color analyst for Toronto Blue Jays radio broadcasts, as well as making appearances on television broadcasts. In 2014, he served as a pre- and post-game analyst for Twins telecasts on Bally Sports North (as well as a part-time substitute for regular game analyst Bert Blyleven) and as a regular on-air contributor on KTWN-FM and the Twins Radio Network.

On February 10, 2015, it was announced that Morris had been hired as a part-time analyst for Detroit Tigers telecasts on Fox Sports Detroit, along with former teammate Kirk Gibson. In a unique arrangement, Morris continued to work part-time for the Twins&#x27; television crew as well as the Tigers&#x27;. In 2017, it was announced that Morris would no longer do Tigers telecasts. On January 15, 2019, Morris was once again named a color commentator for the Tigers.

On August 17, 2021, Morris used an accent that some deemed insensitive during a broadcast while Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels was at bat. Later during the broadcast, he issued an on-air apology. Ohtani said (through an interpreter), &quot;Personally, I&#x27;m not offended and I didn&#x27;t take anything personally.&quot; Following this incident, Morris was suspended indefinitely from the Tigers&#x27; broadcast booth, though he returned in less than a month&#x27;s time. After the 2022 season, Morris parted ways from the Tigers broadcast team.

Morris has two sons from his first marriage and one with his second. He is known for his love of hunting and fishing, especially in his native Minnesota.

==Hall of Fame candidacy==
Morris was eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame from 2000 to 2014, but did not receive the required 75% of the vote; from 2000 to 2003, he never received greater than 30%. But his vote totals slowly crept upwards as the years went by, receiving 40% of the vote for the first time in 2006. In 2010, he managed 52.3% of the vote. In 2012, he received 67% of the vote, and 67.7% a year later. On January 8, 2014, Morris received 61.5% of the vote in his last year of eligibility. After falling off the regular ballot, Morris was elected to the Hall by the Modern Era portion of the Veterans Committee in December 2017. He was inducted (as a Detroit Tiger) in 2018 along with former Tigers teammate Alan Trammell. His 3.90 career ERA is the highest of any player elected to the Hall of Fame as a pitcher.

As a result of being the first Hall of Fame pitcher to have played all of his games in the American League following the introduction of the designated hitter rule and before the start of interleague play, Morris has the fewest MLB regular-season at-bats of any player inductee: one. On April 30, 1987, Morris pitched a complete game victory over the California Angels; in the eighth, DH Mike Heath moved to first base, thus eliminating the designated hitter for the rest of the contest. Morris came up with two out in the ninth, hitting a foul fly to right; it was his first time in the batter&#x27;s box since playing for the minor-league Evansville Triplets in 1977. (Morris also logged 19 appearances as a pinch runner in his career, scoring four times. This makes him the only Hall of Fame player to have more runs than plate appearances.)

<doc id="374581" wikidata="Q2157266" url="?curid=374581" title="Oligopeptide">
<text>A tripeptide (example [[Valine|Val]]-[[Glycine|Gly]]-[[Alanine|Ala]]) with [[Oligopeptide|green]] marked [[N-terminus|amino end]] ([[Valine|[[Oligopeptide|L-Valine]]]]) and [[Oligopeptide|blue]] marked [[C-terminus|carboxyl end]] ([[Alanine|[[Oligopeptide|L-Alanine]]]])
A tetrapeptide (example [[Valine|Val]]-[[Glycine|Gly]]-[[Serine|Ser]]-[[Alanine|Ala]]) with [[Oligopeptide|green]] marked [[N-terminus|amino end]] ([[Valine|[[Oligopeptide|L-valine]]]]) and [[Oligopeptide|blue]] marked [[C-terminus|carboxyl end]] ([[Alanine|[[Oligopeptide|L-alanine]]]])
An oligopeptide (&quot;&quot;, &quot;a few&quot;), is a peptide consisting of two to twenty amino acids, including dipeptides, tripeptides, tetrapeptides, and other polypeptides. Some of the major classes of naturally occurring oligopeptides include aeruginosins, cyanopeptolins, microcystins, microviridins, microginins, anabaenopeptins, and cyclamides. Microcystins are best studied because of their potential toxicity impact in drinking water. A review of some oligopeptides found that the largest class are the cyanopeptolins (40.1%), followed by microcystins (13.4%).

==Production==
Oligopeptide classes are produced by nonribosomal peptides synthases (NRPS), except cyclamides and microviridins are synthesized through ribosomic pathways.

==Examples==
Examples of oligopeptides include:

* Amanitins - Cyclic peptides taken from carpophores of several different mushroom species. They are potent inhibitors of RNA polymerases in most eukaryotic species, the prevent the production of mRNA and protein synthesis. These peptides are important in the study of transcription. Alpha-amanitin is the main toxin from the species &quot;Amanita phalloides&quot;, poisonous if ingested by humans or animals.
* Antipain - An oligopeptide produced by various bacteria which acts as a protease inhibitor.
* Ceruletide - A specific decapeptide found in the skin of &quot;Hyla caerulea&quot;, the Australian green tree frog.

<text>Kasaragod () is a municipal town and administrative headquarters of Kasaragod district in the state of Kerala, India. Established in 1966, Kasaragod was the first municipal town in the district. It is the northernmost district of Kerala and is also known as &quot;Sapta Bhasha Sangama Bhumi&quot; (&#x27;The Land of seven Languages&#x27;).

Situated in the rich biodiversity of Western Ghats, it is known for the Chandragiri and Bekal Fort, Chandragiri River, historic Kolathiri Rajas, natural environment of Ranipuram and Kottancheri Hills, historical and religious sites like the Madiyan Kulom temple, Madhur Temple, Ananthapuram Lake Temple and Malik Deenar Mosque. The historic hill of Ezhimala is located on the southern portion of Kavvayi Backwaters of Nileshwaram.

Kasaragod is located 90 km north of Kannur city corporation and 50 km south of Mangalore. Kasaragod district has the maximum number of rivers in Kerala - 12. The town is located on the estuary where the Chandragiri River, which is also the longest river in the district, empties into the Arabian Sea. Kasaragod is home to several forts, including Arikady fort, Bekal Fort, Chandragiri Fort, and Hosdurg Fort. Bekal Fort is the largest and best preserved fort in Kerala. Talakaveri, which is home to Talakaveri Wildlife Sanctuary where the 805 km long Kaveri river originates, is located closer to Ranipuram on the Kerala-Karnataka border.

Robert Caldwell describes the extent of Malayalam in the 19th century as extending from Chandragiri (fort and river) in the north to Neyyar river beyond Thiruvananthapuram in the south and from Malabar Coast in the west to Western Ghats in the east besides the inhabited islands of Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea.

==Etymology==
Said to be from Kannada &quot;kāsara&quot; &quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot; and &quot;gōḍe&quot; &quot;rampart&quot;. In Malayalam Kasaragod was known as &quot;kāññirakkōṭŭ&quot; (The land of &quot;kāññiram&quot; trees). &quot;kāññiram&quot; is Malayalam for Kasaraka trees (Kannada name) found in abundance here.

Kasaragod was under the Kumbla dynasty until the 16th century, which was vassal to the kingdom of Kolathunadu based at Kannur. Kannada kingdoms focused on the port and surroundings in the 16th century CE.

==History==
===Ancient era===
The ancient Tamil works of the Sangam Age record that the area covering the district was part of Puzhinadu which consists of the coastal belt from Kozhikode to Mangalore. Politically the area was part of the Ezhimala Kingdom with its capital at Ezhimala in present-day Kannur district. The most famous king of Ezhimala was Nannan whose kingdom extended up to Gudalur and northern parts of Coimbatore. Poozhinad, along with Karkanad which included the eastern regions of Ezhimala dynasty (Wayanad-Gudalur region with some portions of Kodagu), had its capital at Ezhimala. The Mooshaka kings were considered descendants of Nannan. By the 14th century, Mooshaka Kingdom was known as Kolathirinad and the rulers as Kolathiris. The Kolathunad Kingdom at the peak of its power reportedly extended from Netravati River (Mangalore) in the north to Korapuzha (Kozhikode) in the south with Arabian Sea on the 
west and Kodagu hills on the eastern boundary, also including the isolated islands of Lakshadweep in Arabian Sea.

===Medieval era===

Kasaragod, about 50 km south of Mangalore city, was an important centre of trade in earlier times. &quot;Ramacharitam&quot;, probably the oldest literary work written in Old Malayalam, which dates back to the 12th century CE, is thought to have written in Kasaragod district as its manuscripts were discovered from Nileshwaram and the poem mentions about Ananthapura Lake Temple in Kumbla in detail. Kasaragod was known to the Arabs by the name &quot;Harkwillia&quot;. The Malik Dinar Mosque in Kasaragod town is one of the oldest &quot;Masjid&quot;s in the Indian subcontinent. According to &quot;Qissat Shakarwati Farmad&quot;, the &quot;Masjids&quot; at Kodungallur, Kollam, Madayi, Barkur, Mangalore, Kasaragod, Kannur, Dharmadam, Panthalayini, and Chaliyam, were built during the era of Malik Dinar, and they are among the oldest &quot;Masjid&quot;s in the Indian subcontinent. It is believed that Malik Dinar died at Thalangara in Kasaragod town. Many Arab travelers visiting Kerala between the 9th and the 14th centuries visited Kasaragod, being an important trade centre then. Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese traveler who visited Kumbla, near Kasaragod Town in 1514 recorded that rice being exported for coir to Maldives. According to Barbosa, the people in the southwestern Malabar coast of India from Chandragiri in the north to Kanyakumari in the south spoke a unique language, which they called as &quot;Maliama&quot; (Malayalam).

Until the 16th century CE, Kasaragod town was known by the name &quot;Kanhirakode&quot; (may be by the meaning, &#x27;the land of &quot;Kanhira&quot; trees&#x27;) in Malayalam. The Kumbla dynasty, who swayed over the land of southern Tulu Nadu wedged between Chandragiri River and Netravati River (including present-day taluks of Manjeshwar and Kasaragod) from &quot;Maipady Palace&quot; at Kumbla, had also been vassals to the Kolathunadu kingdom of North Malabar, before the Carnatic conquests of Vijayanagara Empire. The Kumbla dynasty had a mixed lineage of Malayali Nairs and Tuluva Brahmins. They also claimed their origin from Cheraman Perumals of Kerala. Francis Buchanan-Hamilton states that the customs of Kumbla dynasty were similar to those of the contemporary Malayali kings.

The Kolathiri Dominion emerged into ten independent principalities, i.e. Kadathanadu (Vadakara), Randathara or Poyanad (Dharmadom), Kottayam (Thalassery), Nileshwaram, Iruvazhinadu (Panoor), Kurumbranad etc., under separate royal chieftains due to the outcome of internal dissensions. Many portions of the present-day Hosdurg taluk (Kanhangad) and Vellarikundu were parts of the Nileshwaram dynasty, who were relatives to both Kolathunadu as well as Zamorin of Calicut, in the early medieval period. The areas north to the Chandragiri river (present-day Taluks of Manjeshwaram and Kasaragod) were ruled by the Kumbala dynasty.

The Chandragiri Fort is built on the southern bank of the estuary of Chandragiri River, just opposite to Kasaragod town. The Bekal Fort at Bekal, Pallikkara, which is situated midway between Kasaragod and Kanhangad, and which is largest fort in Kerala, was built in 1650 by Shivappa Nayaka of Keladi.

===Colonial era===

Francis Buchanan, the family doctor of Arthur Wellesley, visited Kasaragod in 1800. In his travelogue, he recorded information on places like Athiraparambu, Kavvayi, Nileshwaram, Bekal, Chandragiri and Manjeshwar.

Hosdurg and Vellarikundu was part of Kolathunadu (south of Chandragiri river) and Kasaragod and Manjeshwaram was in the Tulu Nadu region (north of Chandragiri river).

In 1763, Hyder Ali raided Bedanoor (Bidnur), the capital of the Ikkery Naiks. His son Tippu Sultan raided much of Malabar region in Kerala. As per the Treaty of Seringapatam of 1792, Tippu surrendered Malabar, except Kanara to the British. The British occupied Kanara only after the death of Tippu Sultan. it is said that &quot;Kinavoor Molom&quot; (Sree Dharma Shashtha Temple) is belonging to &quot;Karinthalam&quot; (one of 64 Brahmin villages in old Kerala). Initially South Canara was placed under the Bombay presidency. Later on 16 April 1862, South Canara was transferred to Madras Presidency and Kasaragod taluk was formed by replacing the erstwhile Bekal taluk. Kasaragod was the second-most populated Taluk in South Canara only after to Mangalore taluk, and also the second-largest Taluk.

===Post-Independence===
Before the formation of Kerala, Kasaragod was a part of South Canara district of erstwhile Madras Presidency. However, in the 19th century CE, Kasaragod Taluk witnessed many struggles to separate the region from South Canara and to merge it with the Malabar District as it was the only Malayalam-majority region in South Canara. Kasaragod became a part of Kannur district of Kerala following the reorganization of states and the formation of Kerala on 1 November 1956. Later Kasaragod was divided into two taluks for the ease of administration - Kasaragod and Hosdurg. Kasaragod was declared a district in 1984. The inclusion of Kasaragod with Kerala has been a contentious issue as there is a sizeable population that speaks Tulu and Kannada. At the time of 1951 Census of India, only 72.0% of the district&#x27;s population chose their mother tongue as Malayalam. 14.2% chose Tulu and 6.3% chose Kannada. But it is noted that as per the 2011 census report only 8.8% and 4.2% of the total population in the district speak Tulu and Kannada respectively as their mother tongue. In 2012, the Second Oommen Chandy ministry appointed a commission under the leadership the former Chief Secretary P. Prabhakaran to study about the backwardness and issues faced by this northernmost district of Kerala and to draw up special package for the district. In 2013, two more Taluks, namely Manjeshwaram and Vellarikundu were formed in the district.

<doc id="374583" wikidata="Q942582" url="?curid=374583" title="Cost–benefit analysis">
<text>Cost–benefit analysis (CBA), sometimes also called benefit–cost analysis, is a systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives. It is used to determine options which provide the best approach to achieving benefits while preserving savings in, for example, transactions, activities, and functional business requirements. A CBA may be used to compare completed or potential courses of action, and to estimate or evaluate the value against the cost of a decision, project, or policy. It is commonly used to evaluate business or policy decisions (particularly public policy), commercial transactions, and project investments. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission must conduct cost-benefit analyses before instituting regulations or deregulations.

CBA has two main applications:
# To determine if an investment (or decision) is sound, ascertaining if – and by how much – its benefits outweigh its costs.
# To provide a basis for comparing investments (or decisions), comparing the total expected cost of each option with its total expected benefits.

CBA is related to cost-effectiveness analysis. Benefits and costs in CBA are expressed in monetary terms and are adjusted for the time value of money; all flows of benefits and costs over time are expressed on a common basis in terms of their net present value, regardless of whether they are incurred at different times. Other related techniques include cost–utility analysis, risk–benefit analysis, economic impact analysis, fiscal impact analysis, and social return on investment (SROI) analysis.

Cost–benefit analysis is often used by organizations to appraise the desirability of a given policy. It is an analysis of the expected balance of benefits and costs, including an account of any alternatives and the &quot;status quo&quot;. CBA helps predict whether the benefits of a policy outweigh its costs (and by how much), relative to other alternatives. This allows the ranking of alternative policies in terms of a cost–benefit ratio. Generally, accurate cost–benefit analysis identifies choices which increase welfare from a utilitarian perspective. Assuming an accurate CBA, changing the &quot;status quo&quot; by implementing the alternative with the lowest cost–benefit ratio can improve Pareto efficiency. Although CBA can offer an informed estimate of the best alternative, a perfect appraisal of all present and future costs and benefits is difficult; perfection, in economic efficiency and social welfare, is not guaranteed.

The value of a cost–benefit analysis depends on the accuracy of the individual cost and benefit estimates. Comparative studies indicate that such estimates are often flawed, preventing improvements in Pareto and Kaldor–Hicks efficiency. Interest groups may attempt to include (or exclude) significant costs in an analysis to influence its outcome.

== History ==

The concept of CBA dates back to an 1848 article by Jules Dupuit, and was formalized in subsequent works by Alfred Marshall. Jules Dupuit pioneered this approach by first calculating &quot;the social profitability of a project like the construction of a road or bridge&quot; In an attempt to answer this, Dupuit began to look at the utility users would gain from the project. He determined that the best method of measuring utility is by learning one&#x27;s willingness to pay for something. By taking the sum of each user&#x27;s willingness to pay, Dupuit illustrated that the social benefit of the thing (bridge or road or canal) could be measured. Some users may be willing to pay nearly nothing, others much more, but the sum of these would shed light on the benefit of it. It should be reiterated that Dupuit was not suggesting that the government perfectly price-discriminate and charge each user exactly what they would pay. Rather, their willingness to pay provided a theoretical foundation on the societal worth or benefit of a project. The cost of the project proved much simpler to calculate. Simply taking the sum of the materials and labor, in addition to the maintenance afterward, would give one the cost. Now, the costs and benefits of the project could be accurately analyzed, and an informed decision could be made.

The Corps of Engineers initiated the use of CBA in the US, after the Federal Navigation Act of 1936 mandated cost–benefit analysis for proposed federal-waterway infrastructure. The Flood Control Act of 1939 was instrumental in establishing CBA as federal policy, requiring that &quot;the benefits to whomever they accrue [be] in excess of the estimated costs.&quot;

More recently, cost-benefit analysis has been applied to decisions regarding investments in cybersecurity-related activities (e.g., see the Gordon–Loeb model for decisions concerning cybersecurity investments).

===Public policy===
CBA&#x27;s application to broader public policy began with the work of Otto Eckstein, who laid out a welfare economics foundation for CBA and its application to water-resource development in 1958. It was applied in the US to water quality, recreational travel, and land conservation during the 1960s, and the concept of option value was developed to represent the non-tangible value of resources such as national parks.

CBA was expanded to address the intangible and tangible benefits of public policies relating to mental illness, substance abuse, college education, and chemical waste. In the US, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 required CBA for regulatory programs; since then, other governments have enacted similar rules. Government guidebooks for the application of CBA to public policies include the Canadian guide for regulatory analysis, the Australian guide for regulation and finance, and the US guides for health-care and emergency-management programs.

===Transportation investment===
CBA for transport investment began in the UK with the M1 motorway project and was later used for many projects, including the London Underground&#x27;s Victoria line. The New Approach to Appraisal (NATA) was later introduced by the Department for Transport, Environment and the Regions. This presented balanced cost–benefit results and detailed environmental impact assessments. NATA was first applied to national road schemes in the 1998 Roads Review, and was subsequently rolled out to all transport modes. Maintained and developed by the Department for Transport, it was a cornerstone of UK transport appraisal in 2011.

The European Union&#x27;s Developing Harmonised European Approaches for Transport Costing and Project Assessment (HEATCO) project, part of the EU&#x27;s Sixth Framework Programme, reviewed transport appraisal guidance of EU member states and found significant national differences. HEATCO aimed to develop guidelines to harmonise transport appraisal practice across the EU.

Transport Canada promoted CBA for major transport investments with the 1994 publication of its guidebook. US federal and state transport departments commonly apply CBA with a variety of software tools, including HERS, BCA.Net, StatBenCost, Cal-BC, and TREDIS. Guides are available from the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, Minnesota Department of Transportation, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and the Transportation Research Board&#x27;s Transportation Economics Committee.

== Accuracy ==

In health economics, CBA may be an inadequate measure because willingness-to-pay methods of determining the value of human life can be influenced by income level. Variants, such as cost–utility analysis, QALY and DALY to analyze the effects of health policies, may be more suitable.

For some environmental effects, cost–benefit analysis can be replaced by cost-effectiveness analysis. This is especially true when one type of physical outcome is sought, such as a reduction in energy use by an increase in energy efficiency. Using cost-effectiveness analysis is less laborious and time-consuming, since it does not involve the monetization of outcomes (which can be difficult in some cases).

It has been argued that if modern cost–benefit analyses had been applied to decisions such as whether to mandate the removal of lead from gasoline, block the construction of two proposed dams just above and below the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River, and regulate workers&#x27; exposure to vinyl chloride, the measures would not have been implemented (although all are considered highly successful). The US Clean Air Act has been cited in retrospective studies as a case in which benefits exceeded costs, but knowledge of the benefits (attributable largely to the benefits of reducing particulate pollution) was not available until many years later.

==Process==
A generic cost–benefit analysis has the following steps:
# Define the goals and objectives of the action.
# List alternative actions.
# List stakeholders.
# Select measurement(s) and measure all cost and benefit elements.
# Predict outcome of costs and benefits over the relevant time period.
# Convert all costs and benefits into a common currency.
# Apply discount rate.
# Calculate the net present value of actions under consideration.
# Perform sensitivity analysis.
# Adopt the recommended course of action.

In United States regulatory policy, cost-benefit analysis is governed by OMB Circular A-4.

==Evaluation==
CBA attempts to measure the positive or negative consequences of a project. A similar approach is used in the environmental analysis of total economic value. Both costs and benefits can be diverse. Costs tend to be most thoroughly represented in cost–benefit analyses due to relatively-abundant market data. The net benefits of a project may incorporate cost savings, public willingness to pay (implying that the public has no legal right to the benefits of the policy), or willingness to accept compensation (implying that the public has a right to the benefits of the policy) for the policy&#x27;s welfare change. The guiding principle of evaluating benefits is to list all parties affected by an intervention and add the positive or negative value (usually monetary) that they ascribe to its effect on their welfare.

The actual compensation an individual would require to have their welfare unchanged by a policy is inexact at best. Surveys (stated preferences) or market behavior (revealed preferences) are often used to estimate compensation associated with a policy. Stated preferences are a direct way of assessing willingness to pay for an environmental feature, for example. Survey respondents often misreport their true preferences, however, and market behavior does not provide information about important non-market welfare impacts. Revealed preference is an indirect approach to individual willingness to pay. People make market choices of items with different environmental characteristics, for example, revealing the value placed on environmental factors.

The value of human life is controversial when assessing road-safety measures or life-saving medicines. Controversy can sometimes be avoided by using the related technique of cost–utility analysis, in which benefits are expressed in non-monetary units such as quality-adjusted life years. Road safety can be measured in cost per life saved, without assigning a financial value to the life. However, non-monetary metrics have limited usefulness for evaluating policies with substantially different outcomes. Other benefits may also accrue from a policy, and metrics such as cost per life saved may lead to a substantially different ranking of alternatives than CBA.In some cases, in addition to changing the benefit indicator, the cost-benefit analysis strategy is directly abandoned as a measure. In the 1980s, to ensure workers&#x27; safety, the US Supreme Court made an important decision to abandon the consideration of return on investment and instead seek the lowest cost-benefit to meet specific standards.

Another metric is valuing the environment, which in the 21st century is typically assessed by valuing ecosystem services to humans (such as air and water quality and pollution). Monetary values may also be assigned to other intangible effects such as business reputation, market penetration, or long-term enterprise strategy alignment.

==Time and discounting==
CBA generally attempts to put all relevant costs and benefits on a common temporal footing, using time value of money calculations. This is often done by converting the future expected streams of costs (formula_1) and benefits (formula_2) into a present value amount with a discount rate (formula_3) and the net present value defined as:formula_4The selection of a discount rate for this calculation is subjective. A smaller rate values the current generation and future generations equally. Larger rates (a market rate of return, for example) reflects human present bias or hyperbolic discounting: valuing money which they will receive in the near future more than money they will receive in the distant future. Empirical studies suggest that people discount future benefits in a way similar to these calculations. The choice makes a large difference in assessing interventions with long-term effects. An example is the equity premium puzzle, which suggests that long-term returns on equities may be higher than they should be after controlling for risk and uncertainty. If so, market rates of return should not be used to determine the discount rate because they would undervalue the distant future.

=== Methods for choosing a discount rate ===
For publicly traded companies, it is possible to find a project&#x27;s discount rate by using an equilibrium asset pricing model to find the required return on equity for the company and then assuming that the risk profile of a given project is similar to that the company faces. Commonly used models include the capital asset pricing model (CAPM):formula_5and the Fama-French model:formula_6where the formula_7 terms correspond to the factor loadings. A generalization of these methods can be found in arbitrage pricing theory, which allows for an arbitrary number of risk premiums in the calculation of the required return.

==Risk and uncertainty==
Risk associated with project outcomes is usually handled with probability theory. Although it can be factored into the discount rate (to have uncertainty increasing over time), it is usually considered separately. Particular consideration is often given to agent risk aversion: preferring a situation with less uncertainty to one with greater uncertainty, even if the latter has a higher expected return.

Uncertainty in CBA parameters can be evaluated with a sensitivity analysis, which indicates how results respond to parameter changes. A more formal risk analysis may also be undertaken with the Monte Carlo method. However, even a low parameter of uncertainty does not guarantee the success of a project.

=== Principle of maximum entropy ===
Suppose that we have sources of uncertainty in a CBA that are best treated with the Monte Carlo method, and the distributions describing uncertainty are all continuous. How do we go about choosing the appropriate distribution to represent the sources of uncertainty? One popular method is to make use of the principle of maximum entropy, which states that the distribution with the best representation of current knowledge is the one with the largest entropy - defined for continuous distributions as:formula_8where formula_9 is the support set of a probability density function formula_10. Suppose that we impose a series of constraints that must be satisfied:

# formula_11, with equality outside of formula_9
# formula_13
# formula_14

where the last equality is a series of moment conditions. Maximizing the entropy with these constraints leads to the functional:formula_15where the formula_16 are Lagrange multipliers. Maximizing this functional leads to the form of a maximum entropy distribution:formula_17There is a direct correspondence between the form of a maximum entropy distribution and the exponential family. Examples of commonly used continuous maximum entropy distributions in simulations include:

* Uniform distribution
** No constraints are imposed over the support set formula_18
** It is assumed that we have maximum ignorance about the uncertainty
* Exponential distribution
** Specified mean formula_19 over the support set formula_20
* Gamma distribution
** Specified mean formula_19 and log mean formula_22 over the support set formula_20
** The exponential distribution is a special case
* Normal distribution
** Specified mean formula_19 and variance formula_25 over the support set formula_26
** If we have a specified mean and variance on the log scale, then the lognormal distribution is the maximum entropy distribution

===CBA under US administrations===
The increased use of CBA in the US regulatory process is often associated with President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration. Although CBA in US policy-making dates back several decades, Reagan&#x27;s Executive Order 12291 mandated its use in the regulatory process. After campaigning on a deregulation platform, he issued the 1981 EO authorizing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to review agency regulations and requiring federal agencies to produce regulatory impact analyses when the estimated annual impact exceeded $100 million. During the 1980s, academic and institutional critiques of CBA emerged. The three main criticisms were:
# That CBA could be used for political goals. Debates on the merits of cost and benefit comparisons can be used to sidestep political or philosophical goals, rules and regulations. 
# That CBA is inherently anti-regulatory, and therefore a biased tool. The monetization of policy impacts is an inappropriate tool for assessing mortality risks and distributional impacts.
# That the length of time necessary to complete CBA can create significant delays, which can impede policy regulation.

These criticisms continued under the Clinton administration during the 1990s. Clinton furthered the anti-regulatory environment with his Executive Order 12866. The order changed some of Reagan&#x27;s language, requiring benefits to justify (rather than exceeding) costs and adding &quot;reduction of discrimination or bias&quot; as a benefit to be analyzed. Criticisms of CBA (including uncertainty valuations, discounting future values, and the calculation of risk) were used to argue that it should play no part in the regulatory process. The use of CBA in the regulatory process continued under the Obama administration, along with the debate about its practical and objective value. Some analysts oppose the use of CBA in policy-making, and those in favor of it support improvements in analysis and calculations.

== Criticisms ==
As a concept in economics, cost-benefit analysis has provided a valuable reference for many public construction and governmental decisions, but its application has gradually revealed a number of drawbacks and limitations. A number of critical arguments have been put forward in response. That include concerns about measuring the distribution of costs and benefits, discounting the costs and benefits to future generations, and accounting for the diminishing marginal utility of income. in addition, relying solely on cost-benefit analysis may lead to neglecting the multifaceted value factors of a project.

=== Distribution ===
CBA has been criticized in some disciplines as it relies on the Kaldor-Hicks criterion which does not take into account distributional issues. This means, that positive net-benefits are decisive, independent of who benefits and who loses when a certain policy or project is put into place. As a result, CBA can overlook concerns of equity and fairness, potentially favoring policies that disproportionately benefit certain groups while imposing burdens on others. Phaneuf and Requate phrased it as follows &quot;CBA today relies on the Kaldor-Hicks criteria to make statements about efficiency without addressing issues of income distribution. This has allowed economists to stay silent on issues of equity, while focusing on the more familiar task of measuring costs and benefits&quot;. The challenge raised is that it is possible for the benefits of successive policies to consistently accrue to the same group of individuals, and CBA is ambivalent between providing benefits to those that have received them in the past and those that have been consistently excluded. Policy solutions, such as progressive taxation can address some of these concerns.

=== Discounting and future generations ===
Others have critiqued the practice of discounting future costs and benefits for a variety of reasons, including the potential undervaluing of the temporally distant cost of climate change and other environmental damage, and the concern that such a practice effectively ignores the preferences of future generations. Some scholars argue that the use of discounting makes CBA biased against future generations, and understates the potential harmful impacts of climate change. The growing relevance of climate change has led to a re-examination of the practice of discounting in CBA. These biases can lead to biased resource allocation.

=== Marginal utility ===
The main criticism stems from the diminishing marginal utility of income. According to this critique, without using weights in the CBA, it is not the case that everyone &quot;matters&quot; the same but rather that people with greater ability to pay receive a higher weight. One reason for this is that for high income people, one monetary unit is worth less relative to low income people, so they are more willing to give up one unit in order to make a change that is favourable for them. This means that there is no symmetry in agents, i.e. some people benefit more from the same absolute monetary benefit. Any welfare change, no matter positive or negative, affects people with a lower income stronger than people with a higher income, even if the exact monetary impacts are identical. This is more than just a challenge to the distribution of benefits in CBA, it is a critique of the ability of CBA to accurately measure benefits as, according to this critique, using unweighted absolute willingness to pay overstates the costs and benefits to the wealthy, and understates those costs and benefits to the poor. Sometimes this is framed in terms of an argument about democracy, that each person&#x27;s preferences should be given the same weight in an analysis (one person one vote), while under a standard CBA model the preferences of the wealthy are given greater weight.

Taken together, according to this objection, not using weights is a decision in itself – richer people receive de facto a bigger weight. To compensate for this difference in valuation, it is possible to use different methods. One is to use weights, and there are a number of different approaches for calculating these weights. Often, a Bergson-Samuelson social welfare function is used and weights are calculated according to the willingness-to-pay of people. Another method is to use percentage willingness to pay, where willingness to pay is measured as a percentage of total income or wealth to control for income. These methods would also help to address distributional concerns raised by the Kaldor-Hick criterion.

=== Limitations in the scope of assessment ===
Economic cost-benefit analysis tends to limit the assessment of benefits to economic values, ignoring the importance of other value factors such as the wishes of minority groups, inclusiveness and respect for the rights of others. These value factors are difficult to rank and measure in terms of weighting, yet cost-benefit analysis suffers from the inability to consider these factors comprehensively, thus lacking the integrity and comprehensiveness of social welfare judgements. Therefore, for projects with a higher standard of evaluation, other evaluation methods need to be used and referred to in order to compensate for these shortcomings and to assess the impact of the project on society in a more comprehensive and integrated manner.

<text>The Dream Center is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit Christian Pentecostal network of community centers based in Los Angeles, California, established in 1994. The president of Dream Center is Matthew Barnett.

==History==

The organization was founded in 1994 by Pastor Matthew Barnett and Tommy Barnett of Dream City Church as a home missions project of the Southern California District of the Assemblies of God.

In 1996, after purchasing the old Queen of Angels Hospital in Echo Park, it transformed it into a social center for the homeless, prostitutes and members of street gangs.

In 2001, Pastor Matthew Barnett and the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel merged the Dream Center with the Angelus Temple, making Barnett the senior pastor over Angelus Temple as well as the Dream Center.

Associated Dream Centers have been established in other cities. As of 2022, the organization has established 84 centers in other cities and countries around the world.

==Programs==
Dream Center offers a food bank, clothing and
assistance programs for victims of disaster, domestic violence, drug addiction, human trafficking and prisoners.

Dream Center came to the aid of many Los Angeles fire victims in 2025 with housing, clothing, groceries, toiletries and meals. 

==Controversy==
In 2005, some Hurricane Katrina evacuees staying at the Dream Center said they had difficulty receiving donations. In response to the complaints several social activists, led by Ted Hayes, an advocate for the homeless, called a news conference demanding an investigation of the Dream Center. After visiting the Dream Center, however, and being given a tour of the facility, the activists concluded that the accusations were groundless. &quot;There is no basis to the complaints we&#x27;ve heard,&quot; Hayes said, &quot;The horror stories reported to us do not exist.&quot;

In 2017, a subsidiary of the Dream Center, in partnership with a private equity fund, purchased the Art Institutes, South University, and Argosy University systems of for-profit colleges from Education Management Corporation. The transaction received significant scrutiny, due to concerns about Dream Center&#x27;s ability to successfully manage the acquired schools, and criticism that the transaction was designed to allow the schools to avoid increased regulation of for-profit colleges. The transaction was never approved by the Department of Education and in 2019, at least 30 of the art institutes and related colleges were closed, with some closures announced abruptly in the middle of the academic year. Some of the Art Institute programs were transferred to Studio Enterprise, a Los Angeles creative arts training firm funded by principals of the private equity firm Colbeck Capital Management.

<text>Alloa (Received Pronunciation ; Scottish pronunciation /ˈaloʊa/; , possibly meaning &quot;rock plain&quot;) is a town in Clackmannanshire in the Central Lowlands of Scotland. It is on the north bank of the Forth at the spot where some say it ceases to be the River Forth and becomes the Firth of Forth. Alloa is south of the Ochil Hills on the western Fife peninsula, east of Stirling and west of Dunfermline; by water Alloa is from Granton.

The town, formerly a burgh of barony, is the administrative centre of Clackmannanshire Council. Historically, the economy relied heavily on trade between Glasgow and mainland Europe through its port. This became increasingly uncompetitive and the port stopped operating in 1970. The local economy is now centred on retail and leisure since the closure of major industries; only one brewer and one glassmaker survive today. Parochially, Alloa was linked with Tullibody. The towns are now distinct, albeit with Lornshill in the middle, and Alloa is about twice the size of its north-western neighbour. The population of Alloa was estimated to be approximately 20,730 residents in 2016.

Alloa grew up under the protection of Alloa Tower which may have been built before 1300 AD. The name of the town has had different spelling at different periods. In the charter granted by King Robert the Bruce in the year 1315, to Thomas de Erskyne, it is called Alway; in some subsequent ones, Aulway, Auleway; and more recently Alloway. Dr Jamieson stated that the most probable etymology of the name was from Aull Waeg – the way to the sea.

===14th century===
Sir Robert Erskine was granted the lands of Alloa and its environs in 1368 for services to King David II and he and his descendants were good stewards, developing the estates and innovating.

===17th century===
One of the earliest maps of the area was made by surveyor and cartographer John Adair in 1681.
See Alloa witches

===18th century===
John Erskine, the 6th Earl of Mar oversaw many far-reaching developments including substantial harbour improvements, a customs house, a &quot;New Town&quot; area of housing, and commissioning the building of the Gartmorn Dam, which was designed by George Sorocold. Erskine owned many of the coal mines, and Robert Bald, a local mining engineer, was contracted to provide water power from the Gartmorn Dam to operate the mines and other industries. Good water supplies and the availability of barley from the carselands encouraged George Younger to set up a brewery in the 1760s and he was soon followed by others. Alloa became one of Scotland&#x27;s premier brewing centres.

The 6th Earl of Mar was forced to flee the country and forfeit his lands after disastrously backing the Jacobite cause in 1715. However, his brother was allowed to purchase the forfeited lands and future generations continued the tradition of creative industry by launching a glass-works in 1750 and laying one of Scotland&#x27;s earliest railways (a waggonway) from the Sauchie mines to down to the harbour in around 1766.

Before 1775, the colliers were attached to the properties in which they were born and were virtual serfs or slaves, supported by the master. After the Colliers and Salters (Scotland) Act 1775 abolished the system, the colliers could move between collieries at will, and they were supported in their needs by the Alloa Colliers&#x27; Fund or Friendly Society which was founded in 1775.

Traces of the waggonway and the Gartmorn Dam can still be seen today, and although the dam is no longer used for energy production or water supply, it is well used for fishing and leisure purposes. The Clackmannanshire Library was founded at Alloa in 1797 and it contained upwards of 1500 volumes. As the 18th century closed a whisky distillery was established at Carsebridge by John Bald.

In the 18th century the staple business of the port was coal with about 50,000 tons a year exported.

===19th century===
In 1813 the first steamboat started to operate out of Alloa harbour. Rival companies later united into the &quot;Stirling, Alloa and Kincardine Steamboat Company&quot;. In 1822 water was brought into the town and in 1828 a gas works was built. While building a road to Alloa Academy in 1828, an ancient burial site was found at Mars Hill, with several finds including two gold armlets. Alloa Academy was built in 1824, being paid for by subscription. The Alloa Swing Bridge was opened to the public on 1 October 1885.

The population was 5,434 in the 1841 census.

===20th century===
After the improvements were made to the harbour during the 18th century, Alloa thrived as a river port through which the products of Glasgow manufacture were exported to continental Europe. At that time, and until the 1950s, the main industry to the north and east of the town was coal mining.

==Industries==
===Wool===

Wool was also locally plentiful and in the early part of the 19th century, John Paton set up a small yarn-spinning business in the town, later establishing Kilncraigs Mill. Much of the Kilncraigs complex has been demolished but a four-storey Edwardian Baroque block of 1903–1904 survives, with an extension of 1936. The buildings were converted to Council offices by LDN architects in 2003/2004. Patons merged with J. &amp; J. Baldwin of Halifax in 1924 to become Paton &amp; Baldwins Ltd.

===Weaving and glass making===

The town itself continued to be known for its weaving and glassmaking industries well into the 19th and early 20th centuries.

===Brewing===

Alloa was long associated with the brewing industry, with at least nine major breweries producing ales at its height. However industrial decline during the mid to late 20th century has led to the economy relying more on retail and leisure. The first brewing firms in the town were Younger in 1762 and Meiklejohn in 1784.
Alloa ale was sent to London and George Younger had an extensive export trade to the West Indies, Egypt and the Far East. Alloa was also home to Alloa Brewery Co, developing Graham&#x27;s Golden Lager in 1927 which was renamed Skol in the 1950s. Closures and mergers during the mid-20th century reduced the number of breweries to two and by 1999 after the closure of MacLay&#x27;s Thistle Brewery, only one remained, the Forth Brewery which became Williams Bros. in 2003.

===Malt distilling===

In addition to the brewing of beer, Alloa is the site of the former Carsebridge Distillery. According to Alfred Barnard, the Victorian historian of British distilling and brewing, the distillery was founded as a malt distillery by John Bald in 1799. In the 1840s it was converted into a grain distillery and by the time of Barnard&#x27;s visit in the mid 1880s the distillery covered 10 acres, employed 150 people, and had an annual output of 1.4 to 1.7 million gallons of pure grain whisky. The distillery&#x27;s owner John Bald and Co was one of five companies that combined to form the Distillers Company Limited in 1877. In 1902, a fire devastated the distillery, after World War I it was refitted and started producing yeast. This yeast production lasted until 1938. In 1956 the distillery was modernised, it expanded in 1966 and in the 1970s a new still house, cooperage and animal feedstuffs plant added. By 1980 the Carsebridge Distillery was the largest grain distillery in Scotland, however it closed in 1983 and was demolished in 1992. One of the distillery&#x27;s Coffey stills is now in use at the Cameronbridge distillery.

===Barrel cooperage===

After whisky ceased to be produced at Carsebridge, the cooperage remained as one of two owned by Diageo in Scotland. In 2008, 30 people worked there assembling or repairing up to 400 bourbon casks, imported from the US, each day. However, in 2009 the company announced that it intended to close the Carsebridge Cooperage and move the work to nearby Cambus. The new Cambus cooperage was opened in December 2011 by the Earl of Wessex.

===Military history===

Alloa is linked to the historic Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders housed at Stirling Castle. Many of the soldiers in the Second World War fought under Montgomery at the Battle of El Alamein and Wadi Akrit where their commanding officer Lorne Campbell won a V.C. They were part of the 7th Argylls under the 51st Highland Division.

===Police===

As of 2014, the temporary national headquarters of Police Scotland is located in Alloa.

== Landmarks ==

Alloa&#x27;s most famous landmark is the 15th century Alloa Tower (National Trust for Scotland), the surviving part of the ancestral medieval residence of the Erskine family, the Earls of Mar.
Despite extensive internal and external alterations, the Tower retains its original medieval wooden roof and battlements, as well as some internal features. It is one of the largest and earliest of Scottish tower houses.

The town formerly contained a large number of 17th and 18th century buildings, but many were cleared with the expansion of milling operations and later with slum clearance in the 20th century. However, Alloa does retain some historic architecture in the form of Alloa Tower, Tobias Bauchop&#x27;s House at 25 Kirkgate (1695), as well as later buildings such as Inglewood House (), Gean House (1912) and Greenfield House (1892).

Carsebridge House, known locally as the Doll&#x27;s House, was a B-listed two-storey house built around 1799 as part of the plan to establish the Carsebridge Distillery. It survived the demolition of the distillery buildings in the 1990s, but was badly damaged by fire in August 2024. It was illegally demolished in September 2024 without listed-building consent.

Alloa Town Hall and Library was designed by the architect Alfred Waterhouse and built in 1886-9 at a cost of £18,008.
The Speirs Centre was built as Alloa&#x27;s swimming pool in 1895 and was designed by Sir John Burnet of Glasgow. The Sheriff Court is by Brown and Wardrop of 1862–5.

Alloa War Memorial (designed 1920 erected 1925) is by Sir Robert Lorimer with sculpture by Pilkington Jackson. The monument to the South African War is also by Lorimer (1904).

==Shopping==
Alloa is served by many food retailers including Iceland Frozen Foods, Tesco, Aldi, Lidl, Morrisons, Asda, Co-op Food and Farmfoods. The Asda supermarket, opened in September 2006, is adjacent to the site of the new railway station and was built on the land where the Alloa brewery once stood.

== Transport ==
After the closure of the Stirling-Alloa-Dunfermline line in 1968 and the Devon Valley Railway in 1973, the town had no passenger railway services for 40 years until 2008. The Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail link project was completed in May 2008. The laying of new track had commenced in September 2006 after much preparatory work, including new drainage works and the grouting of a large number of shallow mine workings. The project also involved the construction of a new bypass road, and a bridge which replaced a level crossing in the town. Alloa railway station reopened in May 2008, a short distance east of its former site, just beyond the location of the former junction to the Devon Valley line that served Tillicoultry and Dollar, and also carried through trains to Kinross and Perth.

ScotRail now operates a half-hourly service from Alloa railway station to Glasgow Queen Street via Stirling, Larbert and Croy between 0641 and 2315 Monday to Saturday and between 1041 and 2141 on Sundays. Passengers can travel to Inverness, Edinburgh Waverley and Aberdeen with a change at Stirling, however for journeys to or from Edinburgh passengers with heavy luggage may find it more convenient to change at Larbert, where Edinburgh and Glasgow services use the same platform.

The new railway opened for traincrew route learning in early April 2008, followed by the opening to the public on Monday 19 May 2008. This had been preceded by an official opening on 15 May 2008, where &quot;LNER Gresley K4 61994 The Great Marquess&quot; hauled four specials to Stirling. The return workings were hauled by Deltic 55022 &quot;Royal Scots Grey&quot;. Transport Minister Stewart Stevenson officially reopened the line.

== Education ==
Besides the two high schools of Lornshill Academy and Alloa Academy, the town also has four primary schools: Sunnyside, Redwell, Park, and St Mungos. In addition to these, the New Struan School is an independently run day and residential school catering for children of both primary and high school ages with autistic spectrum disorders. There is also a OneSchool Global UK that is affiliated to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

== Religious sites ==
Alloa is currently served by two churches in the Church of Scotland, namely Alloa Ludgate Church (formed by the union of Alloa North Parish Church and Alloa West Parish Church in 2009 in the building of the former West Church) and St. Mungo&#x27;s Parish Church. In 1978 the Very Rev Dr Peter Brodie (then minister at St Mungo&#x27;s) was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Four other former St. Mungo&#x27;s ministers have held this position. Its current minister, the Rev. Sang Y Cha, is the first Korean to be ordained to The Church of Scotland. Alloa is part of the Church of Scotland&#x27;s Presbytery of Stirling.

The United Free Church of Scotland has a presence in Alloa through the congregation at Moncrieff United Free Church in Drysdale Street. The congregation is served by the Rev. Jason Lingiah and is part of the Presbytery of East.

On Greenside Street, in the old Greenside mission hall (a mission of Moncrieff United Free Church), is Alloa Elim Pentecostal Church.

There are churches of other denominations in the town, including a Baptist church, and St John&#x27;s Episcopal Church. There are also congregations of Latter-day Saints and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in Alloa.

The Catholic church, also named St Mungo&#x27;s, is located in Mar Street. The church is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dunkeld.

There is a Musalla on Whins Road in Alloa. Muslims who are unable to attend a mosque can use this space as a place of prayer, worship and education. In 2003 it became open to the public.

== Sport ==
Alloa is home to one professional football club: Alloa Athletic Football Club. The club was formed in 1880 under the name of Alloa but changed to its present-day name of Alloa Athletic in 1881. The team currently play in the Scottish Championship, formerly the Scottish Football League First Division, after being promoted as winners of a play-off with Dunfermline Athletic, the season after being crowned champions of the Scottish Football League Third Division at the end of the 2011–12 season. Their home games are played at Recreation Park in Alloa.

== Media ==
Alloa&#x27;s oldest newspaper, the &quot;Alloa Advertiser&quot;, was founded in 1841 as a monthly but in 1855 it became a weekly. Similarly, in 1845, the monthly Clackmannanshire Advertiser became the Alloa Journal. More recently the Wee County News was launched in 1995 but went into liquidation in 2011. Some footage of a woollen mill and glassworks exists on film. River Forth (1956) B&amp;W silent 15 mins.

<doc id="374594" wikidata="Q57403" url="?curid=374594" title="Wilhelm Schickard">
<text>Wilhelm Schickard (22 April 1592 – 24 October 1635) was a German professor of Hebrew and astronomy who became famous in the second part of the 20th century after Franz Hammer, a biographer (along with Max Caspar) of Johannes Kepler, claimed that the drawings of a calculating clock, predating the public release of Pascal&#x27;s calculator by twenty years, had been discovered in two unknown letters written by Schickard to Johannes Kepler in 1623 and 1624.

Hammer asserted that because these letters had been lost for three hundred years, Blaise Pascal had been called and celebrated as the inventor of the mechanical calculator in error during all this time.

After careful examination it was found that Schickard&#x27;s drawings had been published at least once per century starting from 1718, that his machine was not complete and required additional wheels and springs and that it was designed around a &quot;single tooth&quot; carry mechanism that didn&#x27;t work properly when used in calculating clocks.

Schickard&#x27;s machine was the first of several designs of &quot;direct entry&quot; calculating machines in the 17th century (including the designs of Blaise Pascal, Tito Burattini, Samuel Morland and René Grillet). The Schickard machine was particularly notable for its integration of an ingenious system of rotated Napier&#x27;s bones for multiplication with a first known design for an adding machine, operated by rotating knobs for input, and with a register of rotated numbers showing in windows for output. Taton has argued that Schickard&#x27;s work had no impact on the development of mechanical calculators. However, whilst there can be debate about what constitutes a &quot;mechanical calculator&quot; later devices, such as Moreland&#x27;s multiplying and adding instruments when used together, Caspar Schott&#x27;s Cistula, René Grillet&#x27;s machine arithmétique, and Claude Perrault&#x27;s rhabdologique at the end of the century, and later, the Bamberger Omega developed in the early 20th century, certainly followed the same path pioneered by Schickard with his ground breaking combination of a form of Napier&#x27;s bones and adding machine designed to assist multiplication.

Schickard has been called &quot;the father of the computer age&quot;.

==Life==

Schickard was born in Herrenberg and educated at the University of Tübingen, receiving his first degree, B.A. in 1609 and M.A. in 1611. He studied theology and oriental languages at Tübingen until 1613. In 1613 he became a Lutheran minister continuing his work with the church until 1619 when he was appointed professor of Hebrew at the University of Tübingen.

Schickard was a universal scientist and taught biblical languages such as Aramaic as well as Hebrew at Tübingen. In 1631 he was appointed professor of astronomy at the University of Tübingen. His research was broad and included astronomy, mathematics and surveying. He invented many machines such as one for calculating astronomical dates and one for Hebrew grammar. He made significant advances in mapmaking, producing maps that were far more accurate than previously available.

He was, among his other skills, a renowned wood and copperplate engraver.

Wilhelm Schickard died of the bubonic plague in Tübingen, on 23 or 24 October 1635. In 1651, Giovanni Riccioli named the lunar crater Schickard after him.

==Political theory==
In 1625 Schickard, a Christian Hebraist, published an influential treatise, &quot;Mishpat ha-melek, Jus regium Hebraeorum&quot; (Title in both Hebrew and Latin: The King&#x27;s Law) in which he uses the Talmud and rabbinical literature to analyze ancient Hebrew political theory. Schickard argues that the Bible supports monarchy.

==Drawings of a calculating clock==

===History ===
In 1623 and 1624, in two letters that he sent to Kepler, reported his design and construction of what he referred to as an “arithmeticum organum” (“arithmetical instrument”) that he has invented, but which would later be described as a Rechenuhr (calculating clock). The machine was designed to assist in all the four basic functions of arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). Amongst its uses, Schickard suggested it would help in the laborious task of calculating astronomical tables. The machine could add and subtract six-digit numbers, and indicated an overflow of this capacity by ringing a bell. The adding machine in the base was primarily provided to assist in the difficult task of adding or multiplying two multi-digit numbers. To this end an ingenious arrangement of rotatable Napier&#x27;s bones were mounted on it. It even had an additional &quot;memory register&quot; to record intermediate calculations. Whilst Schickard noted that the adding machine was working his letters mention that he had asked a professional, a clockmaker named Johann Pfister to build a finished machine. Regrettably it was destroyed in a fire either whilst still incomplete, or in any case before delivery. Schickard abandoned his project soon after. He and his entire family were wiped out in 1635 by bubonic plague during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Schickard&#x27;s machine used clock wheels which were made stronger and were therefore heavier, to prevent them from being damaged by the force of an operator input. Each digit used a display wheel, an input wheel and an intermediate wheel. During a carry transfer all these wheels meshed with the wheels of the digit receiving the carry.

The Institute for Computer Science at the University of Tübingen is called the Wilhelm-Schickard-Institut für Informatik in his honor.

===Priority of invention ===
There has been a long-standing question about who should be given priority of invention of the mechanical calculator. Schickard&#x27;s mechanism was chronologically earlier but was never able to be used and appears to have had serious design flaws. Pascal&#x27;s design was slightly later but functioned superbly.

In 1718 an early biographer of Kepler, Michael Gottlieb Hansch, had published letters from Schickard that described the calculating machine, and his priority was also mentioned in an 1899 publication, the &quot;Stuttgarter Zeitschrift für Vermessungswesen&quot;. In 1957, Franz Hammer, one of Kepler&#x27;s biographers, announced that Schickard&#x27;s drawings of this previously unknown calculating clock predated Pascal&#x27;s work by twenty years.

Bruno von Freytag-Löringhoff built a replica of Schickard&#x27;s machine in 1960, but had to improve on the design of the carry mechanism: 
Pascal&#x27;s invention was almost certainly independent, as &quot;it is almost certain that Pascal would not have known of Schickard&#x27;s machine.&quot; Pascal realized that a single-tooth gear would only be adequate for a carry that only needs to propagate a few places. For more digits, the force required to propagate extended carries would damage such gears.

The two machines were essentially different in that Pascal&#x27;s machine was designed primarily for addition and (with the use of complementary numbers) for subtraction. The adding machine in Schickard&#x27;s design may have jammed in the unusual case of a carry being required across too many dials, but it could smoothly subtract by reversing the motion of the input dials, in a way that was not possible in the Pascaline. (Experiments with replicas show that in the event of a jam when a carry is attempted across more than, say, three dials, it is obvious to the operator who may intervene to assist the machine to perform the additional carries. This is not as efficient as with the Pascaline, but it is not a fatal deficiency.) The Schickard adding machine also has provision for an audible warning when an output was too large for the available dials. This was not provided for in the Pascaline.

Pascal tried to create a smoothly functioning adding machine for use by his father initially, and later for commercialisation, while the adding machine in Schickard&#x27;s design appears to have been introduced to assist in multiplication (through the calculation of partial products using Napier&#x27;s bones, a process that can also be used to assist division).

<doc id="374595" wikidata="Q544609" url="?curid=374595" title="Angus Ogilvy">
<text>Sir Angus James Bruce Ogilvy (14 September 1928 – 26 December 2004) was a British businessman. He is best known as the husband of Princess Alexandra of Kent, a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. Ogilvy is also remembered for his role in a business scandal, known as the Lonrho affair, involving the breaking of sanctions against Rhodesia during the 1970s. In later years, he was involved in charity work.

==Early life and family==
He was born in London as the second son of the 12th Earl of Airlie and Lady Alexandra Coke, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Leicester. Many of his relatives had close links with the British royal family.

His grandmother, Mabell Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie, was a close friend and lady-in-waiting to Queen Mary. His father was a lord-in-waiting to George V and Lord Chamberlain to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother).

==Education and career==
Ogilvy was educated at Heatherdown School, near Ascot in Berkshire, and later at Eton College (also in Berkshire). Between 1946 and 1948, while on National service, he was commissioned as an officer in the Scots Guards. In 1947, he attended Trinity College, Oxford, graduating in 1950 with a BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE).

After university, Ogilvy worked at the Drayton company and later worked with the tycoon Tiny Rowland at Drayton&#x27;s subsidiary, London and Rhodesia Mining and Land Company (Lonrho). The then-Prime Minister, Sir Edward Heath, criticised the company and described it in the House of Commons as &quot;an unpleasant and unacceptable face of capitalism&quot; on a 1973 court case over the company&#x27;s management style. Ogilvy&#x27;s business career ended in 1976, after he was criticised in a Department of Trade report into the company&#x27;s activities.

==Marriage==

On 24 April 1963, Ogilvy married Princess Alexandra of Kent, a granddaughter of King George V and Queen Mary, and a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, at Westminster Abbey in London. The wedding ceremony was attended by all the members of the royal family and was broadcast worldwide on television, watched by an estimated 200 million people.

Elizabeth offered Ogilvy an earldom on his wedding, which he declined. He also rejected a grace-and-favour apartment at one of the royal palaces. Instead, he leased Thatched House Lodge in Richmond from the Crown Estate, where he lived with Alexandra, who still resides there. She retained a grace-and-favour apartment at St James&#x27;s Palace.

The couple had two children, James (born in 1964) and Marina (born in 1966).

===Issue===
Marina&#x27;s first pregnancy, which was announced in late 1989, caused a controversy as the couple were not married. This resulted in a feud with her parents who suggested she either marry her companion on a shotgun wedding or have an abortion. In an interview with a tabloid at the time, Marina had claimed that her parents had cut off her trust fund and monthly allowance due to their disapproval of her conduct. She also said that she wrote a letter to Queen Elizabeth II, addressing her &quot;Dear Cousin Lilibet&quot;, asking her to intervene in the family dispute. Marina&#x27;s parents denied her allegations and said that they loved her, had not cut her off and that she was welcome at home any time.

==Later years==

After his business career was blighted, Ogilvy was involved with charity work. He served as president of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund and as chairman of Youth Clubs UK, the biggest non-uniformed youth organisation in Britain. He was patron of Arthritis Care, vice-patron of the National Children&#x27;s Homes, chairman of the advisory council of The Prince&#x27;s Trust, a trustee of the Leeds Castle Foundation, as well as being a member of the governing council of Business in the Community and of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He was also a member of the Royal Company of Archers, the Sovereign&#x27;s Bodyguard in Scotland, in which his father had served as one of its four lieutenants.

He suffered from throat cancer in later years, and his last public appearance with his wife was when he accompanied her to Thailand for an official tour.

Ogilvy died in Kingston upon Thames, London, on 26 December 2004 after spending three months in hospital with cancer-related illnesses, including acute pneumonia. His funeral took place at St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor in Windsor Castle on 5 January 2005. He was buried in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore, at Windsor.

==Legacy==
Ogilvy and his wife attended a special service at St Anne&#x27;s Church, Kew, on Sunday 10 May 1964, to mark the church&#x27;s 250th anniversary. A pew cushion in the church is embroidered with their names and coats of arms.

<doc id="374599" wikidata="Q758623" url="?curid=374599" title="Auchterarder">
<text>Auchterarder (; , meaning Upper Highland) is a town north of the Ochil Hills in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, and home to the Gleneagles Hotel. The High Street of Auchterarder gave the town its popular name of &quot;The Lang Toun&quot; or Long Town.

The modern town is a shopping destination with a variety of independent shops and cafes.

==History==
The name &quot;Auchterarder&quot; derives from the Scottish Gaelic roots &quot;uachdar&quot;, &quot;àrd&quot;, and &quot;dobhar&quot;; it means ‘upland of high water.’

Auchterarder Castle stood to the north of the town in the area now known as Castleton. It is said to have been a hunting seat for King Malcolm Canmore in the 11th century and was visited by King Edward I in 1296. It was made ruinous in the 18th century and only fragments remained at the end of the 19th century.

In the Middle Ages, Auchterarder was known in Europe as &#x27;the town of 100 drawbridges&#x27;, a colourful description of the narrow bridges leading from the road level across wide gutters to the doorsteps of houses. The name appears in a charter of 1227 in a grant of land transaction to the Convent of Inchaffray. The Jacobite Earl of Mar&#x27;s army torched the town on 25 January 1716.

In 1834, a controversy over the selection of a parish minister, following the recent passing of the &quot;Veto Act&quot;, allowed the parishioners of Auchterarder to reject the chosen minister, Rev. Robert Young. Whilst this might have ended with the selection of an alternative, Young took the issue to the High Court. The court&#x27;s decision concluded a link between state and church, directly contradicting the church&#x27;s own view, and causing the first in a chain of events which would ultimately lead to the 1843 schism in the Church of Scotland. The remains of this church – the tower – have recently been renovated, and there is a plaque explaining what the church used to look like. As a result of the troubles of 1834, Auchterarder became one of the first towns in Scotland to build its own independent Free Church, indeed appearing to pre-empt the Disruption by commissioning the architect David Cousin to design their church in advance, such that it was completed in 1843 as soon as the Free Church formally came into existence.

Aytoun Hall, which is the main community events venue in the town, was completed in 1872.

The Burgh (Police) Scotland Act of 1892 bestowed Burgh status upon the town and a provost, two bailies, an honorary treasurer, Dean of Guild and six councillors were appointed to manage its affairs.

In 1983 the A9 was diverted to the south, bypassing Auchterarder and Aberuthven, to improve the connection between Stirling and Perth.

The 31st G8 summit was held in the town in July 2005 at the five-star Gleneagles hotel.

In 2008, Caledonian Crescent and Queens Crescent in Auchterarder had the most expensive house prices in Scotland.

==Auchterarder House==

In 1784 the Duke of Perth, in his capacity as Baron of Auchterarder, sold a large swathe of his estate to the Hon. Basil Cochrane who in turn sold it to Lt Col James Hunter, who in 1831 commissioned William Burn to design a large house in the Jacobean style, standing around 2km north of the town. Around 1870 the house was sold to James Reid, a Glasgow businessman connected to locomotive building, who commissioned John James Burnet to internally refurbish the house in 1887. Reid&#x27;s son, Hugh Reid, inherited the property in 1894, at that time Hugh being head of the North British Locomotive Company. Around 1905 Hugh added a tower and rebuilt the entrance. He was knighted in 1922 for services to the British locomotive industry.

==Old Parish Church==

The original church, now ruined, lies 1km north of the town, midway to Auchterarder House. on the B8062. It was built in 1200 and dedicated to St Kessog and was under the control of the Abbey of Inchaffray. St Kessog&#x27;s Well stands nearby the church. A second chapel, dedicated to St Mary, stood in the town itself and was later rededicated as the parish church.

==Transport==
Gleneagles railway station, which is located around to the south-west of Auchterarder, has been the railway station for the town since 1886.

Auchterarder contains a charger operated by Perth and Kinross Council located in Crown Inn Wynd for electric vehicle charging.

The town boasts a Community Bus Service which is low cost to normal users and free to young people and the elderly. The service links the three main residential areas of Auchterarder, namely the South, Townhead and the High Street as well as the two new developments near Hunter Street. The service connects to the local health centre and hospital.

==Climate==
Auchterarder has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). The nearest weather station to Auchterarder is located at Strathallan, around northwest.

<doc id="374601" wikidata="Q202323" url="?curid=374601" title="Al Kaline">
<text>Albert William Kaline ( ; December 19, 1934 – April 6, 2020), nicknamed &quot;Mr. Tiger&quot;, was an American professional baseball right fielder who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers. For most of his career, Kaline played in the outfield, mainly as a right fielder where he won ten Gold Glove Awards and was known for his strong throwing arm. He was selected to 18 All-Star Games, including selections each year between 1955 and 1967. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1980 in his first year of eligibility.

Near the end of his career, Kaline also played as first baseman and, in his last season, was the Tigers&#x27; designated hitter. He retired soon after reaching the 3,000 hit milestone late in the 1974 season. Immediately after retiring from playing, he became the Tigers&#x27; TV color commentator, a position he held from 1975 until 2002. Kaline worked for the Tigers as a front office assistant from 2003 until his death in 2020.

== Early life ==
Kaline was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Naomi (Morgan) and Nicholas Kaline. His family was poor. Several of his relatives played semi-professional baseball, but no one in the family had graduated from high school. When he was eight years old, Kaline developed osteomyelitis and had two inches of bone removed from his left foot. The surgery left him with scarring and permanent deformity, but he was an outstanding pitcher in youth baseball. Kaline had learned to throw a fastball, changeup and curveball by the age of nine.

Kaline attended Baltimore&#x27;s Southern High School, where he starred in basketball and also played football until he sustained a cheek injury. When he tried out for the baseball team, there was no room on the pitching staff so Kaline moved to the outfield. He earned all-state honors in baseball all four years. Kaline said that he was a poor student but that he was well-liked by his teachers. He said that his teachers passed him, believing he would become a baseball player.

== Professional career ==
=== Early years ===
At the time of Kaline&#x27;s signing, the bonus rule implemented by Major League Baseball was still in effect. The rule stipulated that when a major league team signed a player to a contract with a signing bonus in excess of $4,000 ($ today), the team was required to keep that player on their 25-man active roster for two full seasons. If the team failed to comply with the rule, they would lose the rights to that player&#x27;s contract, and the player would then be exposed to the waiver wire.

As Kaline had received a bonus of $15,000 ($ today), he bypassed the minor leagues and joined the Tigers directly from high school. Ed Katalinas, the Detroit scout who had tracked him through high school, said: &quot;To me he was the prospect that a scout creates in his mind and then prays that someone will come along to fit the pattern.&quot;

He made his major league debut on June 25, 1953 in Philadelphia as a late-inning replacement for outfielder Jim Delsing. Kaline wore number 25 during his rookie campaign, but asked teammate Pat Mullin for his No. 6 when he retired after the 1953 season ended. Kaline wore the number for the rest of his major league playing career.

In 1955, at age 20, Kaline ended the season with a .340 batting average, becoming the youngest player ever to win the American League (AL) batting title. No 20-year-old major league player had won a batting title since Ty Cobb in 1907. During the 1955 season, Kaline became the 13th man in major league history to hit two home runs in the same inning, became the youngest to hit three home runs in one game, and finished the year with 200 hits, 27 home runs and 102 runs batted in (RBIs). His 200 hits led the major leagues, and he also led the American League with 321 total bases. Kaline finished second to Yogi Berra in the American League&#x27;s 1955 Most Valuable Player Award voting. He was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the first in a string of consecutive All-Star selections that lasted through 1967.

Kaline followed in 1956 with a .314 batting average, 27 home runs and a career-high 128 RBIs, finishing third in the AL MVP voting. He led the league in outfield assists with 18 in 1956 and again in 1958 with 23. In 1957, he won the first of what would be ten Gold Glove Awards over the next eleven seasons. Kaline was out for several games in 1958 after he was hit by a pitch. He missed several games in 1959 after he was hit by a thrown ball and sustained a fracture in his cheekbone. Kaline had been knocked out from the blow and initial speculation was that he could miss six weeks of the season. Kaline ended up missing only 18 games, and finished the 1959 season with a .327 batting average and 27 home runs. He also led the AL in slugging percentage (.530) and OPS (.940). By the time of his 26th birthday, Kaline had accumulated 1,200 hits, the third highest total by a 25-year-old player in MLB history, behind only Ty Cobb (1,433) and Mel Ott (1,249).

Following the departure of Harvey Kuenn, Kaline played the entire 1960 season in center field, the only time of his career he would do so. In 1961, the Tigers acquired Bill Bruton from the Milwaukee Braves to play center field, allowing Kaline to move back to right field.

In 1961, Kaline led the majors with 41 doubles and hit .324 to finish second in the AL batting race (behind teammate Norm Cash). The Tigers won 101 games, to date the third-highest win total in team history, but still finished eight games behind a New York Yankees team that was led by the home run heroics of Roger Maris (61) and Mickey Mantle (54). Kaline began the 1962 season hitting .345 with 13 home runs and 38 RBIs in 35 games. On May 26 of that season, he sustained a broken collarbone while making a game-ending catch on a ball hit by New York&#x27;s Elston Howard. He missed 57 games due to the injury and Detroit was unable to seriously compete for a pennant due to his absence. When healthy, Kaline was great in 1962, hitting a career-high 29 home runs and driving in 94 runs in only 100 games.

By late March 1963, Kaline said that he felt good and he was hitting .373 in 53 spring training at-bats. In the 1963 regular season, Kaline hit .312 with 27 home runs and 101 RBIs, finishing second to Elston Howard in the American League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award voting. Kaline experienced pain in his left foot, the one that had been affected by osteomyelitis as a child, throughout the 1964 season. His batting average dropped to .293 that season. Kaline tried to ignore the pain, but he saw physicians who thought he was suffering from gout and administered injections.

Still in pain the following season, Kaline saw an orthopedic surgeon who prescribed corrective shoes. &quot;I feel so much better than I did before, that it&#x27;s ridiculous&quot;, Kaline said by June 1965. Sportswriter Milton Gross described Kaline&#x27;s deformed foot, saying, &quot;The pinky and middle finger don&#x27;t touch the ground. The fourth toe is stretched. The second and third are shortened. The first and third toes overlap the second and the fourth is beginning to overlap the big toe, which has begun to bend to the left. It is hard to believe, but for all of his career with the Tigers while he has been called the perfect player, Kaline has bordered on being a cripple.&quot;

In 1966, Kaline tied his career high with 29 home runs. In the summer of 1967, the normally calm Kaline broke a bone in his hand when he struck a baseball bat against a bat rack. Kaline missed a month of play. When he returned, the Tigers were in a four-team pennant race, but the team finished the season one game behind the first place Boston Red Sox.

Kaline missed two months of the 1968 season with a broken arm, but he returned to the lineup when Tiger manager Mayo Smith benched shortstop Ray Oyler and sent center fielder Mickey Stanley to play shortstop to make room for Kaline in the outfield. ESPN later called Smith&#x27;s move one of the ten greatest coaching decisions of the century. In the 1968 World Series, the St. Louis Cardinals won three of the first four games of the series and were leading Game 5 by a score of 3–2 in the seventh inning, when Kaline hit a bases loaded single to drive in two runs. The Tigers won that game, and then won Game 6 in a blowout. Kaline had two hits, two runs scored and three RBI in the Tigers&#x27; 10-run third inning of Game 6. Detroit went on to win Game 7 for their first world championship since 1945. In his only World Series appearance, Kaline hit .379 with two home runs and eight RBIs in seven games. For their victory, Kaline and his teammates each received bonus checks of $10,000 (at a time when Kaline&#x27;s salary was &quot;about $70,000&quot;).

The 1969 Tigers could not repeat the magic of their World Series triumph, as they won 90 games but still finished 19 games behind the Baltimore Orioles in the newly-formed American League East division. Kaline hit .272 with 21 home runs in 131 games. It was the last season of his career that he reached 20 homers.

===Final seasons===
In 1970, Kaline sustained a freak, near-fatal injury in an outfield collision. In a game at Milwaukee&#x27;s County Stadium on May 30, against the Milwaukee Brewers, Kaline collided with center fielder Jim Northrup as they both pursued a fly ball. Kaline fell to the warning track and immediately began to choke; on impact, his jaw had gotten locked and his tongue obstructed his breathing. Alertly, left fielder Willie Horton rushed over and pried opened Kaline&#x27;s mouth, clearing his airway and likely saving his life. Kaline was carried out on a stretcher and spent the night in hospital as a precaution. Later on, he said that he could not remember the incident.

After hitting .294 in 1971, Kaline became the first Tiger to sign a $100,000 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars) contract. He had turned down a pay raise from $95,000 to $100,000 the previous year, saying he did not feel like he deserved it after hitting .278 with 16 home runs in 1970. Detroit contended all season for the 1972 pennant, trailing the Red Sox by a half-game before a series against them to end the regular season. Kaline batted eight times in two games, registering five hits and three runs scored. Detroit won those first two games and clinched the AL East pennant. Kaline batted .313 in 106 games in 1972, topping .300 for the first time since 1967. The Tigers lost the 1972 American League Championship Series to the Oakland Athletics that year after Reggie Jackson stole home in the decisive fifth game of the series. In March 1973, Kaline won the Roberto Clemente Award in recognition of the honor he brought to baseball on and off the field.

On September 24, 1974, Kaline became the 12th player in MLB history to reach the 3,000 hit milestone, when he hit a double off the Orioles&#x27; Dave McNally. After reaching the milestone, Kaline announced that he would retire at season&#x27;s end. &quot;I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s over. I really am. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll miss it. I may miss spring training&quot;, Kaline said after his last game on October 3, 1974. In his final major league season, he was used exclusively as a designated hitter, batting .262 with 13 home runs.

Kaline finished his career with 3,007 hits (then 11th on the all-time list, currently 32nd), 498 doubles, 75 triples, 399 home runs (still a Tigers record as of 2024 and currently 58th on the all-time list), 1,622 runs scored, 1,277 bases on balls, and 1,582 RBIs (currently 44th on the all-time list). He batted over .300 nine times in his career to finish with a lifetime batting average of .297 and hit 25 or more home runs seven times in his career. Kaline also holds Tiger career records for games played (2,834), walks (1,277), and sacrifice flies (104). He had more walks than strikeouts (1,020). Kaline was a good pinch hitter in his career, batting .311 (37-for-119) in that capacity with two home runs and 23 RBI. His highest season strikeout total came in his final season, with 75. Prior to that, Kaline never struck out more than 66 times in a season. Among position players, Kaline ranks 29th all-time (15th among outfielders) in Wins Against Replacement (WAR) with a career mark of 92.8.

Defensively, Kaline finished his career with an overall .987 fielding percentage. In his first full season (1954), he recorded 16 outfield assists, including three in one game (July 7 against the Chicago White Sox). He recorded 84 outfield assists between 1954 and 1958, posting a career-high 23 in 1958. After that season, baserunners rarely tested his arm, and his assist numbers dropped.

==Honors==

Kaline was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1980, becoming the tenth player in history to be inducted in his first year of eligibility. He was named on 340 of the 385 ballots (88.3%) cast by sportswriters. Kaline and Duke Snider were the only candidates elected by the sportswriters in 1980. Kaline later said, &quot;I really never thought I would choose an individual thing that happened just to me over a team thing like the World Series. But I would have to say this is the biggest thing that has ever happened to me.&quot;

Kaline was honored by the Tigers as the first of their players to have his uniform number (6) retired. Versatile and well-rounded, he won ten Gold Glove Awards (1957–59 and 1961–67) for excellence in the field and appeared in the All-Star game 15 times (1955–67, 1971, 1974).

In 1999, Kaline was ranked number 76 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Kaline at number 51 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

In 2022, as part of their SN Rushmore project, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named Kaline on their &quot;Detroit Mount Rushmore of Sports&quot;, along with Detroit Red Wings hockey player Gordie Howe, Detroit Lions football player Barry Sanders, and Detroit Pistons basketball player Isiah Thomas.

Cherry Street, which ran behind the left-field stands at Tiger Stadium, was renamed Kaline Drive in his honor in 1970. On September 27, 1999, when Detroit played its last game at Tiger Stadium against the Kansas City Royals, Kaline was invited to appear in uniform and present the last lineup card to the umpires. He did so along with George Brett, former Kansas City Royals&#x27; great and fellow Hall of Famer.

Kaline was regarded as a well-rounded player by his contemporaries. Baltimore Orioles third baseman Brooks Robinson said of him, &quot;There have been a lot of great defensive players. The fella who could do everything is Al Kaline. He was just the epitome of what a great outfielder is all about – great speed, catches the ball and throws the ball well.&quot; Manager Billy Martin once said, &quot;I have always referred to Al Kaline as &#x27;Mister Perfection&#x27;. He does it all — hitting, fielding, running, throwing — and he does it with that extra touch of brilliancy that marks him as a super ballplayer... Al fits in anywhere, at any position in the lineup and any spot in the batting order.&quot;

The 1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was dedicated to Kaline on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of his hometown&#x27;s only other Midsummer Classic. Kaline, along with Leon Day and former Baltimore Orioles star Brooks Robinson, threw out the ceremonial first pitch to end the pregame ceremonies. Kaline&#x27;s ceremonial first pitch was caught by future Detroit Tiger Ivan Rodriguez, who was starting his All-Star debut.

==Post-playing career==
After his playing career, Kaline lived in the Detroit area, also maintaining a house in Florida, and he remained active within the Tigers organization, serving first as a color commentator on the team&#x27;s television broadcasts (1975–2002) mostly with play by play announcer and former Tiger and fellow Hall of Famer George Kell, and then later as a consultant to the team. Starting in 2003, Kaline served as a special assistant to Tigers President/CEO/General Manager Dave Dombrowski, and his duties included coaching/mentoring outfielders during spring training. Former Tigers teammate Willie Horton also holds this position, and the two threw out the first pitch of the 2006 World Series at Comerica Park. Kaline continued in his assistant role until his death in 2020. His 67 years with one team was one of the longest tenures in MLB history.

Because of his lengthy career and longtime association with the Tigers organization, Kaline&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Mr. Tiger.&quot; Kaline&#x27;s grandson Colin Kaline was selected by the Tigers in the 25th round of the 2007 MLB draft. He did not sign, choosing to play baseball at Florida Southern College. The team drafted him again in the 2011 MLB draft, this time in the 26th round. He played in the low minor leagues with the Detroit organization in 2011–12.

==Personal life==
Kaline married his high school sweetheart, Madge Louise Hamilton, in 1954. He had two sons, Mark Albert Kaline (b. August 21, 1957) and Michael Keith Kaline (b. 1962). Michael played college baseball at Miami University and was the father of Colin Kaline, who had a short Minor League career and was a college coach.

Kaline died in his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, on April 6, 2020; the cause of death was not reported.

<doc id="374605" wikidata="Q1147759" url="?curid=374605" title="Maariv (newspaper)">
<text>Maariv () is a Hebrew-language daily newspaper published in Israel.

From Sunday to Thursday, it is printed under the &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv Hashavu&#x27;a&quot; () brand, while the weekend edition that is out on Friday is called &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv SofHashavu&#x27;a&quot; (). A daily, abridged version of the newspaper, called &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv Haboker&quot; (), is distributed for free every morning during the week. &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv Haboker&quot; is the fourth largest Israeli newspaper in terms of readership (after &quot;Israel HaYom&quot;, &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot; and &quot;Haaretz&quot;).

Since May 2014, &quot;Maariv&quot;″s co-editors in chief are Doron Cohen and Golan Bar-Yosef. Apart from the daily newspaper and its supplements, &quot;Maariv&quot; has a chain of local newspapers with a national-scale distribution and magazine division.

==History==
&quot;Maariv&quot; was founded in 1948 by former &quot;Yediot Aharonot&quot; journalists led by Dr. Ezriel Carlebach, who became Maariv&#x27;s first editor-in-chief. It was the most widely read newspaper in Israel in its first twenty years.

For many years, the Nimrodi family held a controlling stake in &quot;Maariv&quot;, and Yaakov Nimrodi served as its chairman. In March 2010, Zaki Rakib bought a 50% share from Israel Land Development Company and Ofer Nimrodi, bringing new energy and a much needed cash infusion to the newspaper, which had been losing millions of NIS a year since 2004. Rakib became the new chairman.

However, it was announced in March 2011 that Nochi Dankner was to take control of &quot;Maariv&quot; through his Discount Investment. On 25 March, Discount transferred 20 million NIS to the struggling firm. On 11 September, &quot;Maariv&quot;″s chairman Dani Yakobi issued a statement that he would sell the newspaper&#x27;s printing equipment to be able to pay September salaries. On 7 September, Globes announced that Dankner had reached an agreement with Shlomo Ben-Zvi, publisher of &quot;Makor Rishon&quot;, to buy out the newspaper. However, the deal faltered, and Dankner turned to the court on 23 September for a stay of the proceedings&#x27; process. The court appointed a trustee, Shlomo Nass, who ran the newspaper and searched for a buyer. During the following weeks the workers waged a campaign against IDB and Dankner, demanding he honor his obligations to them and pay their salaries, pensions and severance packages in full.
In early November the trustee sold the newspaper to Ben Zvi without the debts or the workers. Ben Zvi kept a fraction of the journalists and commenced a partial convergence process between &quot;Maariv&quot; and &quot;Makor Rishon&quot; under his company, Makor Rishon Hatzofe Hameuchad.

As of January 2013, the company Maariv Modiin Ltd. no longer operates &quot;Maariv&quot;, and until its scheduled closure it was to be operated by the court-appointed trustee.

In March 2014, after a long struggle to stabilize the company, Ben Zvi turned to the municipal Jerusalem court for a stay of proceedings process. &quot;Maariv&quot; closed most of its departments and published only a thin version, until the court-appointed trustee could find a new owner. In May 2014 the brand was purchased by Eli Azur, who has holdings in a number of media outlets in Israel, including &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, &quot;Sport1&quot;, &quot;Israel Post&quot; and 103FM radio station. A few days after the deal was approved, Azur relaunched the daily newspaper as &quot;Maariv-Hashavua&quot;, and a weekend edition called &quot;Maariv-Sofhashavua&quot;, which is an amalgamation of &quot;Maariv&quot; and the group&#x27;s weekend magazine &quot;Sofhashavua&quot;.

==Political orientation==
In 2012, &quot;Maariv&quot;, associated with Israel&#x27;s political center, was critical of Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s center-right government.

Moshe Arens, in a &quot;Haaretz&quot; opinion piece penned in 2012, wrote that the owner of &quot;Maariv&quot; had resolved a few years earlier to steer the newspaper leftward, &quot;forsaking the right-wing readership that was loyal to it for years&quot;.

==Circulation==
In a TGI survey for the first half of 2012, &quot;Maariv&quot;″s market share was 11.9 percent. Until 2013 &quot;Maariv&quot; owned a printing house, which was sold to the newspaper Yisrael Hayom to cover the newspaper&#x27;s big debts. Since then &quot;Maariv&quot; has outsourced the printing operations to other printing houses.

As of 31 July 2023, a TGI survey indicated that &quot;Israel Hayom&quot;, distributed for free, is Israel&#x27;s most-read newspaper, with a 29.4% weekday readership exposure, followed by &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;, with 22.3%, &quot;Haaretz&quot; with 4.8%, &quot;Globes&quot; with 4% and &quot;Maariv&quot; with 3.9%.

<doc id="374608" wikidata="Q957272" url="?curid=374608" title="Armadale, Skye">
<text>Armadale () is a village near the southern end of the Sleat peninsula on the Isle of Skye, in the Highland council area of Scotland. Like most of Sleat, but unlike most of Skye, the area is fairly fertile, and though there are hills, most do not reach a great height. It looks out over the Sound of Sleat, to Morar and Mallaig.

The name ’Armadale’, meaning ‘elongated valley’, derives from the Old Norse &quot;armr&quot; and &quot;dalr&quot;.
Clan Donald has a visitor centre situated next to the ruins of Armadale Castle and surrounded by large gardens, while the nearby Sabhal Mòr Ostaig is a centre of Gaelic learning.
The village is also a small port, and has a regular Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service to Mallaig. It is at the southern end of the A851 road.
When walking on the beach near the pier, it is possible to see otters and seals.

<text>Halton Hills is a town in the Regional Municipality of Halton, located in the northwestern end of the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada with a population of 62,951 (2021).

There are many natural features within these bounds; they include the Niagara Escarpment, and the Bruce Trail. Many of these local features are protected by the Conservation Halton, Credit Valley Conservation &amp; Grand River Conservation Authority.

==Communities==
The primary population centres are Georgetown and Acton. Additionally, there are a number of hamlets and rural clusters within the town, including Ashgrove, Ballinafad (straddling the boundary with Erin), Bannockburn, Crewsons Corners (straddling the boundary with Erin, Guelph-Eramosa and Milton), Glen Williams, Henderson&#x27;s Corners, Hornby, Limehouse, Mansewood, Norval, Scotch Block, Silver Creek, Speyside, Stewarttown, Terra Cotta (straddling the boundary with Caledon), and Wildwood. The area was first settled in the 1820s.

==Geography==
Esquesing Township, of which the greatest part went to form Halton Hills, was favourably described in 1846:

The town is bisected by the Niagara Escarpment from southwest to northeast, and a significant portion of the rural area is located within the provincial Greenbelt. Above the Escarpment, a large proportion of the rural area is classified as environmentally sensitive wetlands, and there are several sites that are licensed for aggregate extraction, for which expansion requires detailed environmental assessment. Below the Escarpment, the rural area is mainly agricultural, with the exception of an industrial area currently being developed between Highway 401 and Steeles Avenue.

The town also forms part of three watersheds:

:* to the west of Acton, a small area flows toward the Grand River
:* the northern half flows into the Credit River, including the Black Creek and Silver Creek tributaries
:* the southern half flows into the Sixteen Mile Creek

The Water Survey of Canada operates two hydrometric monitoring stations in the town, on the Black Creek below Acton, and at Norval on the Credit River.

===Vegetation===

Halton Hills is located in the transition zone between the Huron-Ontario Forest Section of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest zone to the north and the Niagara Section of the Carolinian forest zone to the south. Both forest zones are part of the Mixedwood Plains Ecozone. The natural vegetation in the Huron-Ontario Section is dominated by mixed wood forests. It is a transitional type between the southern deciduous forests and the northern coniferous forests. The forest communities of the Niagara Section are dominated by broad-leaved trees. Overall, Halton Hills consists predominantly of agricultural lands with scattered woodlands and wetlands. The woodlands are mainly deciduous forest and the wetlands are either cedar swamp or cattail marsh.

===Endangered and threatened species===

American ginseng exists in the town, and is protected under the &quot;Endangered Species Act, 2007&quot;. Butternut trees are also threatened by the butternut canker. The hooded warbler and the Jefferson salamander are also designated as threatened species.

Brook trout had been eliminated from the Black Creek watershed for many years, following the ongoing environmental disaster due to the excessive consumption of faecal mater as well as the trailer park polluting the water in the town of Erin. The trout have not returned, and anglers report that most of the fish have almost entirely disappeared from the area.

===Geology===

The physiography and distribution of surface material in the Town of Halton Hills are the result of glacial activity which took place in the Late Wisconsinan Substage of the Pleistocene Epoch. This period of time, which lasted from approximately 23,000 to 10,000 years ago, was marked by the repeated advance and melting back of massive, continental ice sheets.

The Niagara Escarpment dominates the physiography of the town and greatly influenced the pattern of glaciation in the region. The Escarpment, formed by erosion over millions of years, is a high relief bedrock scarp which trends to the north through the central part of the town. To the west, on the upper surface of the Escarpment, hummocky morainic ridges deposited by glacial ice form part of the Horseshoe Moraines physiographic region. To the southeast below the Escarpment, is a smooth glacial till plain partially bevelled by lacustrine action, which forms part of the South Slope and Peel Plain physiographic regions.

The Town of Halton Hills is underlain by Ordovician shales of the Queenston Formation east of the Niagara Escarpment, and by Silurian dolomites of the Amabel Formation west of the Escarpment. The escarpment face exposes a complex succession of shales, sandstones, limestones and dolomites of the Clinton and Cataract Groups. Red shales of the Queenston Formation underlie the eastern half of the town and are generally covered by more than 15 m of glacial sediments, predominantly the Halton Till. There are several areas of thin drift cover south of Georgetown.

The quarrying of limestone has been undertaken since the 19th century, and the lime industry was once quite prevalent. In 1886, the Toronto Lime Company had operations in Limehouse and Acton, employing a total of four draw kilns and eleven set kilns, producing common lime and water lime. At Limehouse, rock from the Clinton formation yielded green and brown shales and blue marl, which were used in the manufacture of mineral paints.

Small oil and gas deposits have been discovered northwest and south of Acton, and around Hornby. While exploration had occurred as early as 1908, with oil being discovered in 1912, significant strikes did not occur until 1954.

The town is located in an area that is considered to be of low seismic potential, and the largest recent earthquake to take place within its limits was of magnitude 3 on 29 June 1955. There is a POLARIS seismic monitoring station located just west of Acton.

===Climate===

Halton Hills has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;).

The Town has two distinct climate zones:
* Zone 5a - north of the Niagara Escarpment
* Zone 5b - south of the Escarpment

Environment and Climate Change Canada operates one climate monitoring station at Georgetown.

== History ==
Both Georgetown and Acton, as well as the smaller communities in the rural area, have histories which go back about 200 years. Settlement began in the 1820s.

The hamlet of Hornby was home to the large Brain Brewery, established in 1845; it was eventually making 5,000 barrels of beer per year with ten employees. The facility closed when Prohibition started in 1916 and did not later reopen. 

Halton Hills was formed in 1974 through the amalgamation of the former Towns of Georgetown and Acton, together with much of the former Esquesing Township, and a small portion of the Town of Oakville lying north of Ontario Highway 401. Originally named the Town of North Halton in the establishing legislation, provision was made for a name change to be adopted in consequence of a referendum, and Halton Hills was thus chosen in October 1973:

On August 1, 2013, Toronto Premium Outlets, the first Premium Outlets Centre in Canada, opened for business on Steeles Avenue at the south end of Halton Hills near the border of Milton, Ontario.

==Demographics==


In 2021, Halton Hills was 84.6% white/European, 13.6% visible minorities, and 1.8% Indigenous. The largest visible minority groups were South Asian (5.6%), Black (1.7%), Chinese (1.2%), Filipino (1.0%) and Latin American (1.0%).

80.8% of residents spoke English as their mother tongue. The next most common first languages were Polish (1.7%), Portuguese (1.6%), French (1.5%), Punjabi (1.4%), Croatian (1.2%), Italian (1.0%) and Spanish (1.0%). 2.2% of residents listed both English and a non-official language as mother tongues, while 0.5% listed both English and French.

61.4% of the population were Christian, down from 72.1% in 2011. 34.3% were Catholic, 16.8% were Protestant, 6.2% were Christian n.o.s, 1.6% were Christian Orthodox and 2.6% belonged to other Christian denominations or Christian-related traditions. 32.2% were non-religious or secular, up from 26.3% in 2011. 6.4% belonged to other religions, up from 1.6% in 2011.The largest non-Christian religions were Islam (2.0%), Sikhism (1.9%), and Hinduism (1.5%).

==Local government==

The town is divided into four wards, each of which elects two local councillors. Two regional councillors are also elected - one from Wards 1 and 2 (i.e., the area that was in the former Town of Acton and the former Township of Esquesing), and one from Wards 3 and 4 (i.e., the area in the former Town of Georgetown). The mayor is elected at large. The mayor and two regional councillors (who also serve on Halton Hills council) represent the town at the council meetings of the Regional Municipality of Halton.

The current (2022-2026) membership of the town council is as follows:

Halton Hills has its own fire department. However, policing is provided by the Halton Regional Police Services. The Town has its own official plan which came into force in March 2008 and was consolidated in 2017 with the Region&#x27;s plan. The libraries in the Town are managed by the Halton Hills Public Library Board.

===Symbols===

In 1975, the Lord Lyon King of Arms awarded arms to the town, followed by the grant of a badge in 1984. Both were subsequently registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority in 2005. They are specifically described as follows:
* Arms: Per pale, dexter Or two bendlets wavy Sable, sinister Azure two escarpes wavy Argent, a chief per fess dancetty Azure and Argent, overall a white pine tree (&quot;Pinus strobus&quot;) proper;
* Motto: &quot;Hereditas Integritas Veritas&quot; ()
* Badge: On an oval Azure a white pine tree Argent within a wreath of five oak leaves alternating with five papyrus leaves Or.

==Transportation==

The town has four main roads:

East-west
* connecting Acton and Georgetown
* between Milton and Brampton

North-south
* between Acton and Milton
* between Ballinafad and Oakville

Bus service is provided by GO Transit along Highway 7 on its Georgetown line corridor. Via Rail and GO Train service are provided at Georgetown GO Station.

The Grand Trunk Railway brought train service to the area in 1856, with stations at Acton and Georgetown. Passenger service to Acton ceased in the 1990s, but GO Train service is planned to be revived there in 2013.

Rail freight service is also provided by Canadian National on its Halton Subdivision from Georgetown southwest through Milton to Burlington. CN&#x27;s Guelph Subdivision between Georgetown and London is currently managed by Goderich–Exeter Railway.

In November 2020, VIA Rail Canada rerouted some of its trains onto the Halton Subdivision through Stewarttown while their usual route was closed for signal upgrades.

From 1917 to 1931, Norval, Georgetown and Acton were also served by the Toronto Suburban Railway.

In his farewell newsletter column Alterman stated that he opened a Substack page also entitled, &quot;Altercation&quot;, on January 21, 2023, and that although publication plans were only in development, he was accepting free subscriptions.

== Early life and education ==
Alterman was born to a Jewish family in 1960. He graduated from Scarsdale High School in the New York suburb.

He earned a BA in history and government from Cornell University, an MA in international relations from Yale University, and a PhD in U.S. history from Stanford University. His doctoral dissertation, completed in 2002 with Barton Bernstein as primary advisor, was entitled, &quot;Two lies: the consequences of presidential deception&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Journalism ===
Alterman began his journalism career in 1983, freelancing originally for &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Washington Monthly&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot;, and later, for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, among others, while working as a senior fellow for the World Policy Institute in New York City and Washington, D.C. Not long after, he became the Washington correspondent for &quot;Mother Jones&quot; and, soon thereafter, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, before returning to &quot;The Nation&quot; as a columnist in 1995.

Alterman has been a contributing editor or columnist for many publications including &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Worth&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;The Sunday Express&quot; (London), while he has also contributed to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, and &quot;Le Monde Diplomatique&quot;. In 2021, he restarted &quot;Altercation&quot; as a newsletter published by &quot;The American Prospect&quot;. It previously had been a daily blog featured by MSNBC beginning in 2002.

=== Television ===
Alterman was hired by MSNBC in 1996, appearing as a commentator on the cable channel and writing a column posted on its website. In 2002, MSNBC engaged him to create the blog daily &quot;Altercation&quot;, one of the first blogs hosted by a mainstream media news organization. In September 2006, after a ten-year association, Alterman and MSNBC parted ways. Media Matters for America hired him as a senior fellow and agreed to host &quot;Altercation&quot;, effective from September 18, 2006. Regular contributors to &quot;Altercation&quot; included the sportswriter Charlie Pierce and the historian and military officer Robert Bateman. On December 22, 2008, Alterman announced that &quot;Altercation&quot; would be moving to the website for &quot;The Nation&quot; in 2009, and would appear on a less regular basis than its previous Monday to Friday schedule. He also has worked as a history consultant for HBO Films.

=== Teaching career ===
Alterman has taught journalism at both New York University and Columbia University. Since fall 2004, he has been a professor of English at Brooklyn College, where he teaches courses in media and media history. In 2007, he was named a CUNY distinguished professor of English at Brooklyn College and professor of journalism at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.

=== Books ===
Alterman&#x27;s first book was entitled, &quot;Sound &amp; Fury: The Making of the Punditocracy&quot;, which won the 1992 George Orwell Award. Alterman wrote the book while studying for his doctorate in U.S. history at Stanford University. Alterman&#x27;s other books include the national best-sellers, &quot;What Liberal Media? The Truth About Bias and the News&quot; (2003, 2004) and &quot;The Book on Bush: How George W. (Mis)leads America&quot; (2004). Other books he has authored include &quot;Who Speaks for America? Why Democracy Matters in Foreign Policy&quot; (1998) and the second edition of &quot;Sound &amp; Fury&quot; (2000). His &quot;It Ain&#x27;t No Sin to be Glad You&#x27;re Alive: The Promise of Bruce Springsteen&quot; (1999, 2001) won the 1999 Stephen Crane Literary Award. In September 2004, Viking Press published &quot;When Presidents Lie|When Presidents Lie: A History of Official Deception and its Consequences&quot; – a version of his doctoral dissertation – on lies of major consequence told by American presidents.

His seventh book, published in 2008 by Viking was entitled, &quot;Why We&#x27;re Liberals: A Political Handbook for Post-Bush America&quot;. Also in 2008, Alterman published a lengthy essay in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on the decline of American newspapers and the future role of new media news sites. His eighth book, &quot;Kabuki Democracy: The System vs. Barack Obama&quot;, was published in early 2011. It was an extension of a lengthy article by him that was published by &quot;The Nation&quot; in summer 2010. Alterman&#x27;s ninth book, &quot;The Cause: The Fight for American Liberalism from Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama&quot; (2012), is a history of postwar American liberalism co-authored with the historian Kevin Mattson. Three years later, in 2015, his tenth book, &quot;Inequality in One City: Bill de Blasio and the New York Experiment&quot; was published.

In 2020, he published his eleventh book, &quot;Lying in State: Why Presidents Lie and Why Trump is Worse&quot;.

His twelfth book was published in 2022 and is entitled &quot;We Are Not One: A History of America’s Fight Over Israel&quot;.

=== Media criticism ===
Alterman&#x27;s media criticism was the subject of two of his books. In contrast to conservative media commentators, Alterman argues that the press is biased against liberals rather than biased in their favor. He was called &quot;the most honest and incisive media critic writing today&quot; in the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot; and the author of &quot;the smartest and funniest political journal out there&quot; in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. In 2008, Alterman became a regular columnist for the Jewish magazine, &quot;Moment&quot;, where he wrote regularly about Jewish issues. From 2009 to 2012, he was a regular contributor to &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;.

== Quotes by and about ==
Alterman was and remains a critic of Ralph Nader for Nader&#x27;s actions in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, arguing that Nader is to blame for the election of George W. Bush because of vote splitting. He has called Nader &quot;Bush&#x27;s Useful Idiot&quot;, myopic, and a deluded megalomaniac. In the documentary, &quot;An Unreasonable Man&quot;, he is quoted as saying about Nader: &quot;The man needs to go away. I think he needs to live in a different country. He&#x27;s done enough damage to this one. Let him damage somebody else&#x27;s now.&quot;

Alterman has criticized Steve Jobs for his avarice and for failing to give any of his wealth to the poor. Jobs died with more than $8 billion in various bank accounts and with shareholdings in a tax-free fund with assets of more than $70 billion. He has also accused Apple of business practices that ultimately result in the misery of Chinese workers. Alterman appears in the award-winning documentary film on Lee Atwater, &quot;Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story&quot;. In it, Alterman said, &quot;Race is poison, but it is poison that works for their side. People vote their fears and not their hopes, and Lee understood that.&quot; He also appears in Robert Greenwald&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Outfoxed&quot;, and in &quot;Best of Enemies&quot;, a documentary about Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley.

His critics have called Alterman a member of the Israel lobby. Alterman observed that his views on Israel are attacked by both the left for being too pro-Israel and by the right, such as &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, for not supporting Israel enough.

<text>Edith Mary Tolkien ( Bratt; 21 January 1889 – 29 November 1971) was an Englishwoman known as the wife of the academic, philologist, poet, and novelist J. R. R. Tolkien. She served as the inspiration for his fictional Middle-earth characters Lúthien Tinúviel and Arwen Undómiel.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Edith Bratt was born in Gloucester on 21 January 1889. Her mother, Frances Bratt, was 30 years old, unmarried, and was the daughter of a local shoe and bootmaker.

According to Humphrey Carpenter, Frances Bratt never married, and the name of Edith&#x27;s father is not listed on her birth certificate. Even so, Frances is reported to have always preserved a photograph of him and his name was known within the Bratt family. Edith, however, was always deeply conscious of having been conceived out of wedlock and never told her own children the name of their grandfather. Subsequent research has identified Edith&#x27;s father as Birmingham paper dealer Alfred Frederick Warrilow, who had previously employed Frances Bratt as governess to his daughter, Nellie Warrilow. When Warrilow died in 1891, he named Frances as his sole executrix in his will.

Edith was brought up in Handsworth, a suburb of Birmingham, by her mother and also her cousin, Jenny Grove (related to Sir George Grove). According to Humphrey Carpenter, the circumstances of Edith&#x27;s birth were frequently the subject of neighbourhood gossip.

Frances Bratt died when her daughter was 14 and Edith was sent to the Dresden House boarding school in Evesham. The school was run by the Watts sisters, who had studied music in Dresden. Although the school had a very &quot;strict regime&quot;, Edith was always to remember it fondly. It was at the Dresden House School where Edith &quot;first developed her great love, and talent, for playing the piano.&quot;

Following school, Edith was expected to become a concert pianist or at the very least a piano teacher. While she considered how to proceed, Edith&#x27;s guardian, solicitor Stephen Gateley, found her rooms at Mrs. Faulkner&#x27;s boarding house at 37 Duchess Road, Birmingham.

===Courtship===
The boarding house at 37 Duchess Road &quot;was a gloomy, creeper-covered house, hung with dingy lace curtains&quot;. It was owned and operated by Mrs. Faulkner, whose husband Louis was &quot;a wine merchant with a taste for his own wares&quot;. Mrs. Faulkner was also a Roman Catholic and &quot;an active member&quot; of the parish attached to the nearby Birmingham Oratory.

Mrs. Faulkner hosted musical soirées which were often attended by the Oratory&#x27;s priests. She was delighted to have, in Edith, a pianist to accompany the soloists. Whenever Edith attempted to practise, however, Mrs. Faulkner &quot;would sweep into the room as soon as the scales and arpeggios began&quot;, and say, &quot;Now, Edith dear, enough for now!&quot;

In later years, Edith told her children that her life at 37 Duchess Road was &quot;rather restricted&quot;. Once, Edith, who &quot;had a lifelong enjoyment of the theatre&quot;, announced that she was going to a matinée at the Theatre Royal. In response, Mrs. Faulkner told her that, &quot;she must take a book to read in the interval to avoid the risk of being talked to by strangers!&quot;

Edith first met Tolkien early in 1908, when he and his younger brother Hilary were moved into 37 Duchess Road by their guardian, Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory. At the time Tolkien, known within his family as Ronald, was 16 years old and Edith was 19. According to Humphrey Carpenter, 

However, before the end of the year the relationship had become known to Tolkien&#x27;s guardian. Viewing Edith as a distraction from Tolkien&#x27;s schoolwork and bothered by her Anglican religion, he forbade any contact between them until Tolkien became a legal adult at 21.

Tolkien grudgingly obeyed this instruction to the letter while Father Morgan&#x27;s guardianship lasted. Edith&#x27;s legal guardian, solicitor Stephen Gately, arranged for her to move to Cheltenham to stay with a family friend, solicitor C. H. Jessop and his wife.

Edith lived in relative comfort in the Jessop&#x27;s spacious house and was waited upon by servants. Unlike at Mrs. Faulkner&#x27;s house, she could play to her content upon the Jessop&#x27;s grand piano.

Edith also played the organ at her local Church of England parish, which she later blamed for her subsequent lifetime of back problems. She also joined the Primrose League and attended local Conservative Party meetings. Aside from the local Vicar, however, the Jessops hosted few visitors and, aside from her school friend Molly Field, Edith felt starved of companionship of her own age.

Even though Edith affectionately called her hosts &quot;Uncle Jessop&quot; and &quot;Auntie Jessop&quot;, Edith later told her children that her host was &quot;a martinet with a strong temper and a weak heart. He dominated his wife, who in turn begged Edith not to cross him. Edith said she would often work out her frustrations on the piano, playing something powerful and stirring, such as a Schubert Impromptu or a Beethoven Sonata. She also spent hours copying music meticulously. One or two of her albums still remain, showing her taste ranging from Classical music to the lighter ballads of the time.&quot;

However, on the evening of his twenty-first birthday, Tolkien wrote a letter to Edith, which contained a declaration of his love and asked her to marry him. She replied saying that she had recently become engaged to her friend Molly&#x27;s brother, Warwickshire farmer George Field, but implied that she had done so only because she felt, &quot;on the shelf&quot;, and believed that Tolkien had forgotten her. Within a week, Tolkien journeyed to Cheltenham, where Edith met him at the railway station. That day, Edith returned her ring and announced her engagement to Tolkien instead.

===Marriage===
According to the couple&#x27;s children John and Priscilla, &quot;Their respective guardians were not enthusiastic, although Father Francis eventually gave his blessing.&quot;

John and Priscilla Tolkien later wrote that while their father was attending Oxford University, &quot;Father Francis sometimes came to visit from Birmingham, once chaperoning Edith. She remembered the train stopping at Banbury and Father Francis insisted upon buying Banbury cakes – the local delicacy – which were very greasy. The grease got everywhere and caused considerable confusion.&quot;

Also following her engagement, Edith announced that she was converting to Roman Catholicism at Tolkien&#x27;s insistence. Because her &quot;Uncle Jessop&quot;, &quot;like many of his age and class, was strongly anti-Catholic&quot;, Edith, who feared his explosive temper, at first resisted her fiancé&#x27;s demands. And indeed, when Jessop learned of Edith&#x27;s decision, he was every bit as enraged as she had feared, and he instantly turned her out of the house.

According to the couple&#x27;s children John and Priscilla Tolkien, &quot;She found a rented house with her cousin, Jenny Grove, and her dog, Sam, in Warwick... Jenny, known in the family as &#x27;Auntie Ie&#x27;, became a substitute mother to Edith and the nearest thing her four children had to a grandmother.&quot; While at Warwick, Edith was also overjoyed to have her own piano, which she continued to play until arthritis forced her to give it up.

The Tolkiens were married in the Catholic Church of St Mary Immaculate on West Street in Warwick on 22 March 1916 and a blue plaque was unveiled at the church in July 2018 to commemorate this. Their week-long honeymoon was spent at Clevedon, in North Somerset, and included a visit to the Cheddar Caves.

Soon after their wedding, Tolkien commenced a course at the British Army signals school at Otley, and in order to be as close to his military camp as possible, Edith moved with her cousin Jennie Grove to a cottage in the village of Great Haywood, where she lived from April 1916 to February 1917. Owing to their wedding occurring during Lent, only the Marriage Service and not the Nuptial Mass had been performed; the couple received a nuptial blessing at the Roman Catholic Church of St John the Baptist, in Great Haywood. In a 1941 letter to their son Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife&#x27;s willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.

===World War I===
Tolkien was subsequently commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Lancashire Fusiliers, transferring to the 11th (Service) Battalion, part of the 25th Division, with the British Expeditionary Force. After spending a last night with Edith at the Plough &amp; Harrow Hotel in Birmingham, Tolkien reported to a troop ship at Folkestone and arrived in France on 4 June 1916. He later wrote:
Tolkien&#x27;s service during the Battle of the Somme was terribly stressful for Edith. According to her children John and Priscilla, &quot;Like thousands of others, our mother longed for the messages Ronald sent. They arrived on official forms, and it hard to tell much beyond the fact that the sender was still alive. Because of this, our parents devised a private code of dots. Edith kept a large map of France on the wall and could gauge fairly well where Ronald was at any time. During this period she carried the added burden of being Hilary&#x27;s next of kin: he suffered a number of minor shrapnel wounds while serving as a Private in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, helping to carry supplies over the notorious Passchendaele Ridge. Each time he was wounded, Edith received a telegram.&quot;

====Homefront====
After Tolkien&#x27;s return from France, their first child, John Francis Reuel (16 November 1917 – 22 January 2003) was born in Cheltenham.

While Tolkien was stationed at Kingston upon Hull, Edith and he went walking in the woods at nearby Roos, and she began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock:

This incident inspired the account of the meeting of Beren and Lúthien, and from that the Song of Beren and Luthien.&quot;

====Post-war====
After World War I, the Tolkiens had three more children: Michael Hilary Reuel (October 1920 – 1984), Christopher John Reuel (1924–2020) and Priscilla Anne Reuel (1929–2022).

===Professor&#x27;s wife===
Tolkien&#x27;s professional career at the universities of Leeds and Oxford resulted in the family moving to these cities. According to Humphrey Carpenter, Edith was not an intellectual and had a difficult time functioning around her husband&#x27;s colleagues and their families. As she often had no companionship other than the children and the servants, Edith&#x27;s loneliness frequently manifested itself as authoritarianism. Another result of her loneliness was her envy and resentment of Tolkien&#x27;s close friendship with C. S. Lewis, whom she regarded as an intruder into her family.

According to Carpenter, 

===Later life===
According to Humphrey Carpenter, 

In a 1992 lecture, George Sayer recalled his friendship with the Tolkiens during the 1950s and 1960s, 

After his retirement during the 1960s, Tolkien decided to move with Edith to a location near Bournemouth, which was then a resort town patronised by the British upper class. Although his status as a best-selling author gave them both easy entry into local society, Tolkien was never comfortable in Bournemouth and missed the company of his fellow intellectuals. Edith, however, was at last in her element as a society matron, which had been Tolkien&#x27;s intention in selecting their new residence in the first place. Their grandson Simon Tolkien states on his website that Edith loved spending time at Bournemouth&#x27;s Miramar Hotel.

===Death===

Edith Tolkien died on 29 November 1971 in Bournemouth at the age of 82, and was buried in Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford. Tolkien was buried with her when he died 21 months later.

== Legacy ==
Below the Tolkiens&#x27; names on their grave are the names of the characters of Beren and Lúthien: in the Middle-earth legendarium, Lúthien was the most beautiful of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and forsook her immortality for her love of the mortal warrior Beren. After Beren was captured by the forces of the dark lord Morgoth, Lúthien rode to his rescue upon the talking wolfhound Huan. Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf Carcharoth, Lúthien, like Orpheus, approached the Valar gods and persuaded them to restore her beloved to life.

Shortly after Edith&#x27;s death, Tolkien wrote the following in a letter to their son Christopher.

<text>A Nipkow disk (sometimes Anglicized as Nipkov disk; patented in 1884), also known as scanning disk, is a mechanical, rotating, geometrically operating image scanning device, patented by Paul Gottlieb Nipkow in Berlin. This scanning disk was a fundamental component in mechanical television, and thus the first televisions, through the 1920s and 1930s.

== Operation ==
The device is a mechanically spinning disk of any suitable material (metal, plastic, cardboard, etc.), with a series of equally-distanced circular holes of equal diameter drilled in it. The holes may also be square for greater precision. These holes are positioned to form a single-turn spiral starting from an external radial point of the disk and proceeding to the center of the disk. When the disk rotates, the holes trace circular ring patterns, with inner and outer diameter depending on each hole&#x27;s position on the disk and thickness equal to each hole&#x27;s diameter. The patterns may or may not partially overlap, depending on the exact construction of the disk. A lens projects an image of the scene in front of it directly onto the disk. Each hole in the spiral takes a &quot;slice&quot; through the image which is picked up as a temporal pattern of light and dark by a sensor. If the sensor is made to control a light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronously at the same speed and in the same direction, the image will be reproduced line-by-line. The size of the reproduced image is again determined by the size of the disc; a larger disc produces a larger image.

When spinning the disk while observing an object &quot;through&quot; the disk, preferably through a relatively small circular sector of the disk (the viewport), for example, an angular quarter or eighth of the disk, the object seems &quot;scanned&quot; line by line, first by length or height or even diagonally, depending on the exact sector chosen for observation. By spinning the disk rapidly enough, the object seems complete and capturing of motion becomes possible. This can be intuitively understood by covering all of the disk but a small rectangular area with black cardboard (which stays fixed), spinning the disk and observing an object through the small area.

== Advantages ==
One of the advantages of using a Nipkow disk is that the image sensor (that is, the device converting light to electric signals) can be as simple as a single photocell or photodiode, since at each instant only a very small area is visible through the disk (and viewport), and so decomposing an image into lines is done almost by itself with little need for scanline timing, and very high scanline resolution. A simple acquisition device can be built by using an electrical motor driving a Nipkow disk, a small box containing a single light-sensitive (electric) element and a conventional image focusing device (lens, dark box, etc.).

Another advantage is that the receiving device is very similar to the acquisition device, except that the light-sensitive device is replaced by a
variable light source, driven by the signal provided by the acquisition device. Some means of synchronizing the disks on the two devices must also be devised (several options are possible, ranging from manual to electronic control signals).

These facts helped immensely in building the first mechanical television accomplished by the Scottish inventor John Logie Baird, as well as the first &quot;TV-Enthusiasts&quot; communities and even experimental image radio broadcasts in the 1920s.

== Disadvantages ==
The resolution along a Nipkow disk&#x27;s scanline is potentially very high, being an analogue scan. However the maximum number of scanlines is much more limited, being equal to the number of holes on the disk, which in practice ranged from 30 to 100, with rare 200-hole disks tested.

Another drawback of the Nipkow disk as an image scanning device: the scanlines are not straight lines, but rather curves.
So the ideal Nipkow disk should have either a very large diameter, which means smaller curvature, or a very narrow angular opening of its viewport. Another way to produce acceptable images would be to drill smaller holes (millimeter or even micrometer scale) closer to the outer sectors of the disk, but technological evolution favoured electronic means of image acquisition.

Another significant disadvantage lay with reproducing images at the receiving end of the transmission which was also accomplished with a Nipkow disk. The images were typically very small, as small as the surface used for scanning, which, with the practical implementations of mechanical television, were the size of a postage-stamp in the case of a 30 to 50 cm diameter disk.

Further disadvantages include the non-linear geometry of the scanned images, and the impractical size of the disk, at least in the past. The Nipkow disks used in early TV receivers were roughly 30 cm to 50 cm in diameter, with 30 to 50 holes. The devices using them were also noisy and heavy with very low picture quality and a great deal of flickering. The acquisition part of the system was not much better, requiring very powerful lighting of the subject.

Disk scanners share a major limitation with the Farnsworth image dissector. Light is conveyed into the sensing system as the small aperture scans over the entire field of view. The actual amount of light gathered is instantaneous, occurring through a very small aperture, and the net yield is only a microscopic percentage of the incident energy.

Iconoscopes (and their successors) accumulate energy on the target continuously, thereby integrating energy over time. The scanning system simply &quot;picks off&quot; the accumulated charge as it sweeps past each site on the target. Simple calculations show that, for equally sensitive photosensitive receptors, the iconoscope is hundreds to thousands of times more sensitive than the disk or the Farnsworth scanner.

The scanning disk can be replaced by a polygonal mirror, but this suffers from the same problem – lack of integration over time.

== Applications ==
Apart from the aforementioned mechanical television, which did not become popular for the practical reasons mentioned above, a Nipkow disk is used in one type of confocal microscope, a powerful optical microscope.

<text>Adobe ColdFusion is a commercial rapid web-application development computing platform created by J. J. Allaire in 1995. (The programming language used with that platform is also commonly called ColdFusion, though is more accurately known as CFML.) ColdFusion was originally designed to make it easier to connect simple HTML pages to a database. By version 2 (1996) it had become a full platform that included an IDE in addition to a full scripting language.

== Overview ==
One of the distinguishing features of ColdFusion is its associated scripting language, ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML). CFML compares to the scripting components of ASP, JSP, and PHP in purpose and features, but its tag syntax more closely resembles HTML, while its script syntax resembles JavaScript. &quot;ColdFusion&quot; is often used synonymously with &quot;CFML&quot;, but there are additional CFML application servers besides ColdFusion, and ColdFusion supports programming languages other than CFML, such as server-side Actionscript and embedded scripts that can be written in a JavaScript-like language known as CFScript.

Originally a product of Allaire and released on July 2, 1995, ColdFusion was developed by brothers Joseph J. Allaire and Jeremy Allaire. In 2001 Allaire was acquired by Macromedia, which in turn was acquired by Adobe Systems Inc in 2005.

ColdFusion is most often used for data-driven websites or intranets, but can also be used to generate remote services such as REST services, WebSockets, SOAP web services or Flash remoting. It is especially well-suited as the server-side technology to the client-side ajax.

ColdFusion can also handle asynchronous events such as SMS and instant messaging via its gateway interface, available in ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise Edition.

=== Main features ===
ColdFusion provides a number of additional features out of the box. Main features include:
* Simplified database access
* Client and server cache management
* Client-side code generation, especially for form widgets and validation
* Conversion from HTML to PDF
* Data retrieval from common enterprise systems such as Active Directory, LDAP, SMTP, POP, HTTP, FTP, Microsoft Exchange Server and common data formats such as RSS and Atom
* File indexing and searching service based on Apache Solr
* GUI administration
* Server, application, client, session, and request scopes
* XML parsing, querying (XPath), validation and transformation (XSLT)
* Server clustering
* Task scheduling
* Graphing and reporting
* Simplified file manipulation including raster graphics (and CAPTCHA) and zip archives (introduction of video manipulation is planned in a future release)
* Simplified web service implementation (with automated WSDL generation / transparent SOAP handling for both creating and consuming services - as an example, ASP.NET has no native equivalent for &lt;CFINVOKE WEBSERVICE=&quot;http://host/tempconf.cfc?wsdl&quot; METHOD=&quot;Celsius2Fahrenheit&quot; TEMP=&quot;#tempc#&quot; RETURNVARIABLE=&quot;tempf&quot;&gt;)

Other implementations of CFML offer similar or enhanced functionality, such as running in a .NET environment or image manipulation.

The engine was written in C and featured, among other things, a built-in scripting language (CFScript), plugin modules written in Java, and a syntax very similar to HTML. The equivalent to an HTML element, a ColdFusion tag begins with the letters &quot;CF&quot; followed by a name that is indicative of what the tag is interpreted to, in HTML. E.g. &lt;cfoutput&gt; to begin the output of variables or other content.

In addition to CFScript and plugins (as described), CFStudio provided a design platform with a WYSIWYG display. In addition to ColdFusion, CFStudio also supports syntax in other languages popular for backend programming, such as Perl. In addition to making backend functionality easily available to the non-programmer, (version 4.0 and forward in particular) integrated easily with the Apache Web Server and with Internet Information Services.

=== Other features ===
All versions of ColdFusion prior to 6.0 were written using Microsoft Visual C++. This meant that ColdFusion was largely limited to running on Microsoft Windows, although Allaire did successfully port ColdFusion to Sun Solaris starting with version 3.1.

The Allaire company was sold to Macromedia, then Macromedia was sold to Adobe. Earlier versions were not as robust as the versions available from version 4.0 forward.

With the release of ColdFusion MX 6.0, the engine had been re-written in Java and supported its own runtime environment, which was easily replaced through its configuration options with the runtime environment from Sun. Version 6.1 included the ability to code and debug Macromedia Flash.

== Versions ==

=== Cold Fusion 3 ===
Version 3, released in June 1997, brought custom tags, cfsearch/cfindex/cfcollection based on the Verity search engine, the server scope, and template encoding (called then &quot;encryption&quot;). Version 3.1, released in Jan 1998, added RDS support as well as a port to the Sun Solaris operating system, while ColdFusion studio gained a live page preview and HTML syntax checker.

=== ColdFusion 4 ===
Released in Nov 1998, version 4 is when the name was changed from &quot;Cold Fusion&quot; to &quot;ColdFusion&quot; - possibly to distinguish it from Cold fusion theory. The release also added the initial implementation of cfscript, support for locking (cflock), transactions (cftransaction), hierarchical exception handling (cftry/cfcatch), sandbox security, as well as many new tags and functions, including cfstoredproc, cfcache, cfswitch, and more.

=== ColdFusion 4.5 ===
Version 4.5, released in Nov 1999, expanded the ability to access external system resources, including COM and CORBA, and added initial support for Java integration (including EJB&#x27;s, Pojo&#x27;s, servlets, and Java CFX&#x27;s). IT also added the getmetricdata function (to access performance information), additional performance information in page debugging output, enhanced string conversion functions, and optional whitespace removal.

=== ColdFusion 5 ===
Version 5 was released in June 2001, adding enhanced query support, new reporting and charting features, user-defined functions, and improved admin tools. It was the last to be legacy coded for a specific platform, and the first release from Macromedia after their acquisition of Allaire Corporation, which had been announced January 16, 2001.

=== ColdFusion MX 6 ===
Prior to 2000, Edwin Smith, an Allaire architect on JRun and later the Flash Player, Tom Harwood and Clement Wong initiated a project codenamed &quot;Neo&quot;. This project was later revealed as a ColdFusion Server re-written completely using Java. This made portability easier and provided a layer of security on the server, because it ran inside a Java Runtime Environment.

In June 2002 Macromedia released the version 6.0 product under a slightly different name, ColdFusion MX, allowing the product to be associated with both the Macromedia brand and its original branding. ColdFusion MX was completely rebuilt from the ground up and was based on the Java EE platform. ColdFusion MX was also designed to integrate well with Macromedia Flash using Flash Remoting.

With the release of ColdFusion MX, the CFML language API was released with an OOP interface.

=== ColdFusion MX 7 ===
With the release of ColdFusion 7.0 on February 7, 2005, the naming convention was amended, rendering the product name &quot;Macromedia ColdFusion MX 7&quot; (the codename for CFMX7 was &quot;Blackstone&quot;). CFMX 7 added Flash-based and XForms-based web forms, and a report builder that output in Adobe PDF as well as FlashPaper, RTF and Excel. The Adobe PDF output is also available as a wrapper to any HTML page, converting that page to a quality printable document. The enterprise edition also added Gateways. These provide interaction with non-HTTP request services such as IM Services, SMS, Directory Watchers, and an asynchronous execution. XML support was boosted in this version to include native schema checking.

ColdFusion MX 7.0.1 (codename &quot;Merrimack&quot;) added support for Mac OS X, improvements to Flash forms, RTF support for CFReport, the new CFCPRoxy feature for Java/CFC integration, and more. ColdFusion MX 7.0.2 (codenamed &quot;Mystic&quot;) included advanced features for working with Adobe Flex 2 as well as more improvements for the CF Report Builder.

=== Adobe ColdFusion 8 ===
On July 30, 2007, Adobe Systems released ColdFusion 8, dropping &quot;MX&quot; from its name. During beta testing the codename used was &quot;Scorpio&quot; (the eighth sign of the zodiac and the eighth iteration of ColdFusion as a commercial product). More than 14,000 developers worldwide were active in the beta process - many more testers than the 5,000 Adobe Systems originally expected. The ColdFusion development team consisted of developers based in Newton/Boston, Massachusetts and offshore in Bangalore, India.

Some of the new features are the CFPDFFORM tag, which enables integration with Adobe Acrobat forms, some image manipulation functions, Microsoft .NET integration, and the CFPRESENTATION tag, which allows the creation of dynamic presentations using Adobe Acrobat Connect, the Web-based collaboration solution formerly known as Macromedia Breeze. In addition, the ColdFusion Administrator for the Enterprise version ships with built-in server monitoring. ColdFusion 8 is available on several operating systems including Linux, Mac OS X and Windows Server 2003.

Other additions to ColdFusion 8 are built-in Ajax widgets, file archive manipulation (CFZIP), Microsoft Exchange server integration (CFEXCHANGE), image manipulation including automatic CAPTCHA generation (CFIMAGE), multi-threading, per-application settings, Atom and RSS feeds, reporting enhancements, stronger encryption libraries, array and structure improvements, improved database interaction, extensive performance improvements, PDF manipulation and merging capabilities (CFPDF), interactive debugging, embedded database support with Apache Derby, and a more ECMAScript compliant CFSCRIPT.

For development of ColdFusion applications, several tools are available: primarily Adobe Dreamweaver CS4, Macromedia HomeSite 5.x, CFEclipse, Eclipse and others. &quot;Tag updaters&quot; are available for these applications to update their support for the new ColdFusion 8 features.

=== Adobe ColdFusion 9 ===
ColdFusion 9 (Codenamed: Centaur) was released on October 5, 2009. New features for CF9 include:
* Ability to code ColdFusion Components (CFCs) entirely in CFScript.
* An explicit &quot;local&quot; scope that does not require local variables to be declared at the top of the function.
* Implicit getters/setters for CFC.
* Implicit constructors via method called &quot;init&quot; or method with same name as CFC.
* New CFFinally tag for Exception handling syntax and CFContinue tag for Control flow.
* Object-relational mapping (ORM) Database integration through Hibernate (Java).
* Server.cfc file with onServerStart and onServerEnd methods.
* Tighter integration with Adobe Flex and Adobe AIR.
* Integration with key Microsoft products including Word, Excel, SharePoint, Exchange, and PowerPoint.
* In Memory Management - or Virtual File System: an ability to treat content in memory as opposed to using the HDD.
* Exposed as Services - an ability to access, securely, functions of the server externally.

=== Adobe ColdFusion 10 ===
ColdFusion 10 (Codenamed: Zeus) was released on May 15, 2012. New or improved features available in all editions (Standard, Enterprise, and Developer) include (but are not limited to):
* Security enhancements
* Hotfix installer and notification
* Improved scheduler (based on a version of quartz)
* Improved web services support (WSDL 2.0, SOAP 1.2)
* Support for HTML5 web sockets
* Tomcat integration
* Support for RESTful web services
* Language enhancements (closures, and more)
* Search integration with Apache Solr
* HTML5 video player and Adobe Flash Player
* Flex and Adobe AIR lazy loading
* XPath integration
* HTML5 enhancements

Additional new or improved features in ColdFusion Enterprise or Developer editions include (but are not limited to):
* Dynamic and interactive HTML5 charting
* Improved and revamped scheduler (additional features over what is added in CF10 Standard)
* Object relational mapping enhancements

The lists above were obtained from the Adobe web site pages describing &quot;new features&quot;, as listed first in the links in the following list.

CF10 was originally referred to by the codename Zeus, after first being confirmed as coming by Adobe at Adobe MAX 2010, and during much of its prerelease period. It was also commonly referred to as &quot;ColdFusion next&quot; and &quot;ColdFusion X&quot; in blogs, on Twitter, etc., before Adobe finally confirmed it would be &quot;ColdFusion 10&quot;. For much of 2010, ColdFusion Product Manager Adam Lehman toured the US setting up countless meetings with customers, developers, and user groups to formulate a master blueprint for the next feature set. In September 2010, he presented the plans to Adobe where they were given full support and approval by upper management.

The first public beta of ColdFusion 10 was released via Adobe Labs on 17 February 2012.

=== Adobe ColdFusion 11 ===

ColdFusion 11 (Codenamed: Splendor) was released on April 29, 2014.

New or improved features available in all editions (Standard, Enterprise, and Developer) include:
* End-to-end mobile development
* A new lightweight edition (ColdFusion Express)
* Language enhancements
* WebSocket enhancements
* PDF generation enhancements
* Security enhancements
* Social enhancements
* REST enhancements
* Charting enhancements
* Compression enhancements

ColdFusion 11 also removed many features previously identified simply as &quot;deprecated&quot; or no longer supported in earlier releases. For example, the CFLOG tag long offered date and time attributes which were deprecated (and redundant, as the date and time is always logged). As of CF11, their use would not cause the CFLOG tag to fail.

=== Adobe ColdFusion (2016 Release) ===

Adobe ColdFusion (2016 release), Codenamed: Raijin (and also known generically as ColdFusion 2016) was released on February 16, 2016.

== Development roadmap ==
In Sep 2017, Adobe announced the roadmap anticipating releases in 2018 and 2020. Among the key features anticipated for the 2016 release were a new performance monitor, enhancements to asynchronous programming, revamped REST support, and enhancements to the API Manager, as well as support for CF2016 projected into 2024. As for the 2020 release, the features anticipated at that time (in 2017) were configurability (modularity) of CF application services, revamped scripting and object-oriented support, and further enhancements to the API Manager.

== Features ==

=== PDF generation ===
ColdFusion can generate PDF documents using standard HTML (i.e. no additional coding is needed to generate documents for print). CFML authors place HTML and CSS within a pair of cfdocument tags (or new in ColdFusion 11, cfhtmltopdf tags). The generated document can then either be saved to disk or sent to the client&#x27;s browser. ColdFusion 8 introduced also the cfpdf tag to allow for control over PDF documents including PDF forms, and merging of PDFs. These tags however do not use Adobe&#x27;s PDF engine but cfdocument uses a combination of the commercial JPedal Java PDF library and the free and open source Java library iText, and cfhtmltopdf uses an embedded WebKit implementation.

=== ColdFusion Components (Objects) ===
ColdFusion was originally not an object-oriented programming language like PHP versions 3 and below. ColdFusion falls into the category of OO languages that do not support multiple inheritance (along with Java, Smalltalk, etc.). With the MX release (6+), ColdFusion introduced basic OO functionality with the &quot;component&quot; language construct which resembles classes in OO languages. Each &quot;component&quot; may contain any number of properties and methods. One component may also extend another (Inheritance). Components only support single inheritance. Object handling feature set and performance enhancing has occurred with subsequent releases. With the release of ColdFusion 8, Java-style interfaces are supported. ColdFusion components use the file extension &quot;cfc&quot; to differentiate them from ColdFusion templates (.cfm).

==== Remoting ====
Component methods may be made available as web services with no additional coding and configuration. All that is required is for a method&#x27;s access to be declared &#x27;remote&#x27;. ColdFusion automatically generates a WSDL at the URL for the component in this manner: http://path/to/components/Component.cfc?wsdl. Aside from SOAP, the services are offered in Flash Remoting binary format.

Methods which are declared remote may also be invoked via an HTTP GET or POST request. Consider the GET request as shown.

 http://path/to/components/Component.cfc?method=search&amp;query=your+query&amp;mode=strict
This will invoke the component&#x27;s search function, passing &quot;your query&quot; and &quot;strict&quot; as arguments.

This type of invocation is well-suited for Ajax-enabled applications. ColdFusion 8 introduced the ability to serialize ColdFusion data structures to JSON for consumption on the client.

The ColdFusion server will automatically generate documentation for a component if you navigate to its URL and insert the appropriate code within the component&#x27;s declarations. This is an application of component introspection, available to developers of ColdFusion components. Access to a component&#x27;s documentation requires a password. A developer can view the documentation for all components known to the ColdFusion server by navigating to the ColdFusion URL. This interface resembles the Javadoc HTML documentation for Java classes.

=== Custom Tags ===
ColdFusion provides several ways to implement custom markup language tags, i.e. those not included in the core ColdFusion language. These are especially useful for providing a familiar interface for web designers and content authors familiar with HTML but not imperative programming.

The traditional and most common way is using CFML. A standard CFML page can be interpreted as a tag, with the tag name corresponding to the file name prefixed with &quot;cf_&quot;. For example, the file IMAP.cfm can be used as the tag &quot;cf_imap&quot;. Attributes used within the tag are available in the ATTRIBUTES scope of the tag implementation page. CFML pages are accessible in the same directory as the calling page, via a special directory in the ColdFusion web application, or via a CFIMPORT tag in the calling page. The latter method does not necessarily require the &quot;cf_&quot; prefix for the tag name.

A second way is the developments of CFX tags using Java or C++. CFX tags are prefixed with &quot;cfx_&quot;, for example &quot;cfx_imap&quot;. Tags are added to the ColdFusion runtime environment using the ColdFusion administrator, where JAR or DLL files are registered as custom tags.

Finally, ColdFusion supports JSP tag libraries from the JSP 2.0 language specification. JSP tags are included in CFML pages using the CFIMPORT tag.

== Interactions with other programming languages ==

=== ColdFusion and Java ===
The standard ColdFusion installation allows the deployment of ColdFusion as a WAR file or EAR file for deployment to standalone application servers, such as Macromedia JRun, and IBM WebSphere. ColdFusion can also be deployed to servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat and Mortbay Jetty, but because these platforms do not officially support ColdFusion, they leave many of its features inaccessible. As of ColdFusion 10 Macromedia JRun was replaced by Apache Tomcat.

Because ColdFusion is a Java EE application, ColdFusion code can be mixed with Java classes to create a variety of applications and use existing Java libraries. ColdFusion has access to all underlying Java classes, supports JSP custom tag libraries, and can access JSP functions after retrieving the JSP page context (&quot;GetPageContext()&quot;).

Prior to ColdFusion 7.0.1, ColdFusion components could only be used by Java or .NET by declaring them as web services. However, beginning in ColdFusion MX 7.0.1, ColdFusion components can now be used directly within Java classes using the CFCProxy class.

Recently, there has been much interest in Java development using alternate languages such as Jython, Groovy and JRuby. ColdFusion was one of the first scripting platforms to allow this style of Java development.

=== ColdFusion and .NET ===
ColdFusion 8 natively supports .NET within the CFML syntax. ColdFusion developers can simply call any .NET assembly without needing to recompile or alter the assemblies in any way. Data types are automatically translated between ColdFusion and .NET (example: .NET DataTable → ColdFusion Query).

A unique feature for a Java EE vendor, ColdFusion 8 offers the ability to access .NET Assemblies remotely through proxy (without the use of .NET Remoting). This allows ColdFusion users to leverage .NET without having to be installed on a Windows operating system.

== Abbreviations ==

The initialism for the ColdFusion Markup Language is &quot;CFML&quot;. When ColdFusion templates are saved to disk, they are traditionally given the extension .cfm or .cfml. The .cfc extension is used for ColdFusion Components. The original extension was DBM or DBML, which stood for Database Markup Language. When talking about ColdFusion, most users use the acronym CF and this is used for numerous ColdFusion resources such as user groups (CFUGs) and sites.

CFMX is the common abbreviation for ColdFusion versions 6 and 7 (a.k.a. ColdFusion MX).

== Alternative server environments ==
ColdFusion originated as proprietary technology based on Web technology industry standards. However, it is becoming a less closed technology through the availability of competing products. Such alternative products include :

* Lucee - Free, open source CFML engine forked from Railo. Lucee&#x27;s aim is to provide the functionality of CFML using less resources and giving better performance and to move CFML past its roots and into a modern and dynamic web programming platform. Lucee is backed by community supporters and members of the Lucee Association.
These are discontinued or down :
* BlueDragon - Proprietary .NET-based CFML engine and free open source Java-based CFML engine (Open BlueDragon).
* Coral Web Builder
* IgniteFusion
* OpenBD - The open source version of BlueDragon was released as Open BlueDragon (OpenBD) in December 2008.
* Railo - Free, open source CFML engine. It comes in three main product editions, and other versions.
* SmithProject

The argument can be made that ColdFusion is even less platform-bound than raw Java EE or .NET, simply because ColdFusion will run on top of a .NET app server (New Atlanta), or on top of any servlet container or Java EE application server (JRun, WebSphere, JBoss, Geronimo, Tomcat, Resin Server, Jetty (web server), etc.). In theory, a ColdFusion application could be moved unchanged from a Java EE application server to a .NET application server.

== Vulnerabilities ==
In March 2013, a known issue affecting ColdFusion 8, 9 and 10 left the National Vulnerability Database open to attack. The vulnerability had been identified and a patch released by Adobe for CF9 and CF10 in January.

In April 2013, a ColdFusion vulnerability was blamed by Linode for an intrusion into the Linode Manager control panel website. A security bulletin and hotfix for this had been issued by Adobe a week earlier.

In May 2013, Adobe identified another critical vulnerability, reportedly already being exploited in the wild, which targets all recent versions of ColdFusion on any servers where the web-based administrator and API have not been locked down. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to upload malicious scripts and potentially gain full control over the server. A security bulletin and hotfix for this was issued by Adobe 6 days later.

In April 2015, Adobe fixed a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
in Adobe ColdFusion 10 before Update 16, and in ColdFusion 11 before Update 5,
that allowed remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML; however, it&#x27;s exploitable only by users who have authenticated through the administration panel.
In September 2019, Adobe fixed two command injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-8073) that enabled arbitrary code and an alleyway traversal (CVE-2019-8074).

<text>Pyramid is an American game show franchise that has aired several versions domestically and internationally. The show was developed by Bob Stewart. The original series, The $10,000 Pyramid, debuted on CBS on March 26, 1973, and spawned seven subsequent &quot;Pyramid&quot; series. Most later series featured a full title format matching the original series, with the title reflecting an increasing top prize. Two teams, each consisting of a celebrity and contestant, attempt to convey mystery words and phrases within a common category, against a time limit, to win cash and prizes. The title refers to the show&#x27;s pyramid-shaped gameboard, featuring six categories arranged in a triangular fashion. The various &quot;Pyramid&quot; series have won a total of nine Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Game Show, second only to &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, which has won 13.

Dick Clark is the host most commonly associated with the show, having hosted the network daytime version from 1973 to 1980 (which moved from CBS to ABC in 1974, and increased its namesake top prize from $10,000 to $20,000 in 1976) and The (New) $25,000 Pyramid from 1982 to 1988 on CBS. Clark also hosted two weeknight syndicated versions, The $50,000 Pyramid in 1981 and The $100,000 Pyramid from 1985 to 1988 (concurrent with the daytime show).

Bill Cullen hosted the first weekly nighttime version of &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; from 1974 to 1979. John Davidson hosted &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; in 1991, and Donny Osmond hosted a version simply titled Pyramid from 2002 to 2004; both aired five episodes per week. Game Show Network&#x27;s The Pyramid, hosted by Mike Richards, who was an executive at format owner Sony Pictures Television, aired a single forty-episode season in 2012.

The current incarnation of &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; debuted June 26, 2016 on ABC with Michael Strahan as host. On November 11, 2024, it was announced that &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; would be renewed for an eighth season, which is set to premiere on March 9, 2025.

==Gameplay==
The Pyramid&#x27;s game boards, both in the main game and in the Winners&#x27; Circle bonus round, feature six categories arranged in a triangle (referred to as a pyramid), with three on the bottom row, two on the middle row, and one on the top. Most variations of gameplay feature two teams, each composed of a contestant and a celebrity. The game&#x27;s central premise involves teams taking turns, with one player attempting to describe mystery words or phrases to their teammate against a time limit. The higher scoring team wins the game and plays the bonus round.

===Main game===

At the beginning of the game, the teams are shown six categories. Once the category is chosen, its exact meaning is given unless there is a bonus element that requires obscuring the category. One member of the team is then given a list of words or phrases that fit the category (displayed on a monitor before that team member), and must describe each to his or her partner within a time limit. The team member giving the clues may use any form of verbal clue that does not contain the answer (for example, using &quot;high up&quot; for &quot;height&quot;); non-verbal clues such as pantomime are also accepted. One point is scored for each item correctly guessed, and words for which illegal clues are given are eliminated from play. Each category usually consists of seven words or phrases. If a team is stuck on a word or phrase, they may pass and may go back to that word or phrase, provided if there is any time left. All versions of the show feature a maximum of seven words and a thirty-second time limit for each category, except for the 2002-04 version, which used six words and a twenty-second time limit.

Each team alternates playing a category until all six have been played, although it is possible for a category to go unplayed if one team is so far behind that they cannot score enough points to catch up. In addition, the teams alternate in each round of play as to whether the celebrity or the contestant gives the clues.

In versions prior to the 2010s, tie scores were broken by an additional round of gameplay. The host offered the team who scored the tying a point a choice of two different letters of the alphabet. That team then played a round consisting entirely of words beginning with that letter, after which the opposing team played words beginning with the other letter. The tie was then broken by whichever team achieved more points or, if both teams successfully played all seven words, whichever team did so in a shorter amount of time. Starting with the 2016 version of the show, ties are broken by whichever team achieved their score in a faster amount of time.

After a round of gameplay, the higher-scoring team proceeds to the show&#x27;s bonus round, known as the Winner&#x27;s Circle. Once the Winner&#x27;s Circle is completed, a new round of gameplay begins with the celebrities switching teams and a new selection of categories. After this round is completed, the winning team proceeds to the second and final Winner&#x27;s Circle.

====Bonuses====
The game board has often featured a number of spaces which award bonus prizes to the contestants.

Throughout the 1970s, a random category during the main game doubled as the &quot;Big 7&quot;, meaning that the contestant originally received a prize if all seven words were guessed correctly. Beginning in 1982, a random category in the second round was designated as the &quot;Mystery 7&quot;, in which the host did not reveal the topic of the category until after the fact, and correctly guessing all seven words awarded a bonus prize. This bonus feature was reinstated for the second round of the 2010s version.

In 1983, &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; introduced a new bonus space called the &quot;7-11&quot;, which was randomly concealed behind a category in the first round of gameplay. If this was revealed, the team could elect to play for $1,100 cash if all seven words were guessed correctly, or $50 per correct word; the latter option was dropped in early 1985. During the $100,000 tournament weeks in the 1980s and 1990s, no bonus prizes were on the maingame board, but the perfect score tiebreaker award was still intact.

The 1991 version offered additional bonuses. &quot;Gamble for a Grand&quot;/&quot;Gamble for a Trip&quot; offered the choice to reduce the round&#x27;s time limit from 30 to 25 seconds to win $1,000 cash or a trip, respectively, and &quot;Double Trouble&quot; offered the team 45 seconds to guess seven two-word responses for a $500 bonus.

The Donny Osmond-hosted version had one bonus: &quot;Super Six&quot;, which was featured in both games each day, and awarded an additional prize for guessing all six words in 20 seconds.

On the Game Show Network version, there were no bonuses behind the categories, but correctly guessing all seven words in a category awarded $500 to the contestant and added $5,000 to the Winner&#x27;s Circle bank.

===Winner&#x27;s Circle===

The winning team from the main game plays the Winner&#x27;s Circle, in which one member must describe six categories, ostensibly of increasing difficulty, to their partner within 60 seconds by giving a short and concise list of items relating to each category in play. (For instance, the category &quot;things that clean&quot; could be described with clues such as &quot;soap&quot;, &quot;a vacuum&quot;, or &quot;a maid&#x27;s broom&quot;.) The team is credited with solving a category as long as the guesser says its key word (here, &quot;clean&quot;) before time runs out. Although it has not been stated in official rules, since Strahan has been hosting, the contestant gives the clues and the celebrity must guess the categories. In prior versions of the show, celebrities usually gave the clues. In the earliest episodes of the show, the host would ask the contestant whether or not they wanted to give or receive clues in the winner&#x27;s circle. 

The clue giver may pass on a category and return to it after playing through all six if time remains on the clock. Giving an illegal clue removes the category from play. These include using gestures (which were permitted until 1974); using any part of a key word in the category, a definition, or a direct synonym of it; using a prepositional phrase; or listing an item that does not fit the category. Each category in the Winner&#x27;s Circle has a cash amount attached to it; successfully playing all six categories wins the top cash prize for that round, while failing to do so awards the cash amounts attached to all solved categories.

==History==
===Broadcast history===
====&quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot;====

On March 26, 1973, &quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot;, with host Dick Clark, made its network debut and was a ratings hit, sustaining its ratings even when episodes were delayed or preempted by the Watergate hearings. A year later, the ratings temporarily declined (against the original version of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; on NBC) and CBS canceled it. The show was quickly picked up by ABC and began airing on that network on May 6, 1974. As per CBS custom at the time with celebrity game shows, three weeks of episodes for CBS were taped in Hollywood at Television City, Studio 31. The remainder of the CBS episodes originated in New York City at the Ed Sullivan Theater, moving to ABC&#x27;s Elysee Theatre after &quot;Pyramid&quot; switched networks.

====&quot;The $20,000 Pyramid&quot;====
Beginning on January 19, 1976, the series doubled its top prize and was retitled &quot;The $20,000 Pyramid&quot; . From October 1 to November 9, 1979, the series briefly became &quot;Junior Partner Pyramid&quot;, which scrapped the usual celebrity-contestant pairings in favor of children playing the game with a parent or other adult relative. Its last episode aired June 27, 1980, with &quot;Family Feud&quot; subsequently moving up a half-hour to take over the 12:00 noon (EST) slot formerly occupied by &quot;The $20,000 Pyramid&quot;.

====&quot;The (New) $25,000 Pyramid&quot;====

On September 20, 1982, the series returned to the CBS daytime lineup as &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot;, again with Clark as host. &quot;New&quot; was added to the show&#x27;s title on November 8, 1982 and remained for a little over 2 years. Eventually, &quot;New&quot; was dropped from the title, and on January 28, 1985, and the show was once again known as &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot;. The series taped in Los Angeles full-time at CBS Television City&#x27;s Studio 33 (formerly used for &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, now known as the &quot;Bob Barker Studio&quot;). The series remained there for the entire run (except for some episodes that were filmed in studio 41 in September of 1983) until the series was cancelled. The last episode of the series aired on Friday, January 1, 1988. &quot;Blackout&quot; replaced this version of the Pyramid and began airing in the series&#x27; 10:00 a.m. timeslot on Monday, January 4, 1988. Blackout was canceled after 13 weeks of episodes. On April 4, 1988, &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; returned to the CBS daytime schedule, but only for 13 more weeks. The $25,000 Pyramid was the only network game show to replace the series that replaced it after cancellation. The final episode of the $25,000 Pyramid aired on July 1, 1988. The following Monday, the show was replaced by &quot;Family Feud&quot;, hosted by Ray Combs.

====&quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot;====
Concurrent with the network show&#x27;s run, several nighttime versions of the show were sold to local stations through syndication: the original &quot;$25,000 Pyramid&quot; and &quot;The $50,000 Pyramid&quot; were taped in the Elysee Theatre in New York, and both editions of &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; were taped at Television City. The Dick Clark-hosted episodes were taped in Studio 33 concurrently with the daytime &quot;$25,000 Pyramid&quot;, and the 1991 edition hosted by John Davidson was taped in Studio 31. 

On January 9, 2016, ABC greenlit a new version of &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot;, set to air during the summer of 2016. This version also marked the return of the show to New York City, where it had originally been produced in the 1970s. The first season comprised ten hour-long episodes, with Michael Strahan serving as host. The show aired as part of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Fun &amp; Games&quot; lineup at 9:00pm ET/8:00pm CT, along with the Steve Harvey-hosted &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; and the Alec Baldwin-hosted &quot;Match Game&quot; (the latter of which ended in July 2021). Each episode of &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; consists of two full games. Additionally, two introductions and two closings are taped with ability to air either.

This incarnation of &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; debuted on ABC on June 26, 2016; the first season ran until September 12, 2016. The show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on June 11, 2017 and ran until September 24, 2017. On August 6, 2017, the show was renewed for a third season, which ran from June 10, 2018 to September 23, 2018; the show was then renewed for a fourth season which ran from June 9, 2019 to September 22, 2019. On November 20, 2019, the series was renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on May 26, 2021 and ran until September 15, 2021.

In August 2020, production for season five of &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; began in New York City with new safety protocols and guidelines introduced; these guidelines include measures such as crew and contestants having their temperatures tested, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) on-site, and social distancing measures. This season did not feature an in-studio audience due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On January 6, 2022, ABC renewed &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; for a sixth season, and moved the show from New York City to Los Angeles. The first half of the sixth season premiered on July 10, 2022 and ran until December 6, 2022, while the second half of the sixth season premiered on July 9, 2023 and ran until August 27, 2023. The show was ultimately renewed for a seventh season which premiered on September 28, 2023 and concluded on December 13, 2023.

On November 11, 2024, it was announced that &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; would be renewed for an eighth season, which is set to premiere on March 9, 2025.

===Later developments===
In late 1996, Sony Pictures Television (then-Columbia TriStar Television) produced a pilot for a new version of &quot;Pyramid&quot;, with Mark Wahlberg as host, which featured a format radically different from the earlier versions, including an increase of the number of celebrities to six, each of which would be assigned to a different main game subject. It did not sell, but Sony tried again the following year, this time with Chuck Woolery at the helm and a format closer to the original, although the six-celebrity motif from the previous pilot remained. This version also failed to sell, but two years later, after the success of its series &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Jeopardy!&quot; on VH1, Sony attempted to give &quot;Pyramid&quot; similar treatment with a 1999 pilot called &quot;Pyramid Rocks&quot;. Hosted by Bil Dwyer, the format likewise attempted to incorporate music into the game, but proved no more successful than the previous two attempts at reviving the series.

The show would remain off the air until 2002, when a syndicated series, simply titled &quot;Pyramid&quot;, successfully sold its pilot and was ordered for a full season. The series was hosted by Donny Osmond and ran for two seasons from September 16, 2002 to May 21, 2004, with reruns airing until September 10, 2004. The show was taped at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California. 

Following CBS&#x27;s cancellation of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in April 2009, &quot;Pyramid&quot; was one of three potential series considered as a replacement for the veteran soap opera. (&quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; and &quot;The Dating Game&quot; as &quot;The New Dating Game&quot; or &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; as &quot;The New Newlywed Game&quot; were the other two, with a pilot shot for the former series.) During the tapings that took place in June of that year at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York, the top prize was raised to a potential $1,000,000 with a tournament format similar to the $100,000 format. Dean Cain and Tim Vincent were tapped as hosts of the pilots, with &quot;$50,000&quot; announcer Alan Kalter returning, and Sony Pictures game show legend Ken Jennings served as a panelist in the pilots.

CBS passed on &quot;Pyramid&quot; and opted to pick up &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, hosted by Wayne Brady, as &quot;Guiding Light&#x27;s&quot; replacement. Several months later, in December 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of another long-running soap opera, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. &quot;Pyramid&quot; was once again among the series being considered as a potential replacement. CBS ordered a third pilot on April 9, 2010. Andy Richter was identified as a potential host. On May 18, 2011, TBS announced development of a possible new version of &quot;Pyramid&quot;, again to be hosted by Andy Richter. It was later announced that the show was not picked up.

Another pilot, titled &quot;The Pyramid&quot;, was taped on June 16, 2012. On July 12, 2012, GSN announced &quot;The Pyramid&quot; had been picked up and would premiere on the network on September 3, with Mike Richards hosting the show. The series ran for 40 episodes before being cancelled later in the year. &quot;The Pyramid&quot; was taped at the CBS Studio Center.

==Conception==
Television producer Bob Stewart developed &quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot; in 1973. The show&#x27;s format was adapted from an unsold television pilot Stewart had filmed earlier titled &quot;Cash on the Line&quot;.

==Personnel==
Bob Clayton was the series&#x27; original announcer and performed these duties until his death in 1979. Alan Kalter and Steve O&#x27;Brien shared the primary announcer role until &quot;The $50,000 Pyramid&quot; ended production in 1981. Substitutes included Fred Foy, John Causier, Dick Heatherton, Scott Vincent, and Ed Jordan.

When the series was revived and production moved to California in 1982, Jack Clark became the announcer and held the position until 1985. Johnny Gilbert became the primary announcer for &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; while Charlie O&#x27;Donnell took the job for &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; when it launched that fall. Both Gilbert and O&#x27;Donnell substituted for each other on their respective series; other substitutes included Jerry Bishop, Rod Roddy, Bob Hilton, Charlie Tuna, and Dean Goss. In 1991, Gilbert and Goss were both featured announcers and frequent panelist Henry Polic II also announced for several weeks. John Cramer announced the 2002–04 version, and JD Roberto announced &quot;The Pyramid&quot; (2012). The 2016 ABC primetime version is announced by Brad Abelle.

Mike Gargiulo directed through 1981, with Bruce Burmester replacing him until the end of the 1991 version.

The original theme tune was &quot;Tuning Up&quot; by Ken Aldin. In 1982, it was replaced by an original, similarly styled composition by Bob Cobert, which was also used in 1991. Barry Coffing and John Blaylock composed the theme and incidental music for the 2002–04 version, while Alan Ett composed a cover of Bob Cobert&#x27;s 1982–91 theme for &quot;The Pyramid&quot;. Bleeding Fingers Music composed a separate cover of Cobert&#x27;s theme for the 2016 version.

==International versions==
The British version was called &quot;The Pyramid Game&quot; and ran intermittently from 1981 to 1990, with Steve Jones as host. Donny Osmond hosted a short-lived incarnation in 2007, which used a similar set and the same music package as the 2002 American version.

In 2009, Sony created an Australian version of &quot;The Junior Partner Pyramid&quot; called simply &quot;Pyramid&quot;. This version was hosted by Shura Taft until 2012, with Graham Matters taking over the following year.

A German version titled &quot;Die Pyramide&quot; aired on ZDF from 1979 to 1994, and was hosted by Dieter Thomas Heck. A new version aired on ZDFneo in 2012, and was co-hosted by Micky Beisenherz and Joachim Llambi.

Versions in French, both titled &quot;Pyramide&quot;, were produced at different times in France and in Canada.

==Home games==
The first board game of &quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot; was released in 1974 by the Milton Bradley Company, with a total of eight editions produced through 1981. Beginning with the fourth edition, like its TV counterpart, the title and top payoff changed to &quot;The $20,000 Pyramid&quot;, while the final edition was titled &quot;The $50,000 Pyramid&quot;. However, due to concerns about players easily memorizing possible Winners&#x27; Circle subjects, the format of the board game&#x27;s Winners&#x27; Circle endgame was changed to mirror that of the TV version&#x27;s main game.

Cardinal Games released a new home version of &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; in 1986, this time using the actual Winners&#x27; Circle rules and format, which was also given to all contestants who appeared on both the daytime and nighttime versions for most of 1987 and select 1988 episodes. This version was reissued in 2000 by Endless Games, which later released a new edition based on the Osmond version in 2003.

&quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot;, a video game adaptation, was released in 1987. Developed and published by Box Office Software, it was originally released for Apple II and then ported to MS-DOS and Commodore 64. Sierra Attractions released a Microsoft Windows version of &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; in 2001, which was followed by a DVD game from MGA Entertainment in 2006.

A version titled &quot;The $1,000,000 Pyramid&quot; was released by Ubisoft for the Wii in 2011.

<doc id="374651" wikidata="Q3492596" url="?curid=374651" title="Erin, Ontario">
<text>Erin () is a town in Wellington County, approximately northwest of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Erin is bordered by the Town of Caledon, Ontario to the east, the Town of Halton Hills to the south, the Township of Guelph/Eramosa to the west and the Township of East Garafraxa to the north.

The amalgamated town is composed of the former villages of Erin and Hillsburgh, both urban centres now, as well as the former Township of Erin (which contained the hamlets of Ballinafad, Brisbane, Cedar Valley, Crewson&#x27;s Corners, Ospringe and Orton). Erin&#x27;s Town Council includes a Mayor and four councillors. Its upper tier government is provided by Wellington County.

Erin is primarily a rural community but, while farming is still an important activity in the town, most of its population works in the nearby cities of Brampton, Mississauga, Guelph, and even Toronto. The town&#x27;s new industrial park is attracting a number of new industries, due to its cheaper tax rate, accessibility to transportation, and its location within the &quot;Technology Triangle,&quot; a series of high-tech driven cities including nearby Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge.

The community not for profit organization is East Wellington Community Services.

==Communities==
In addition to the primary settlement of Erin, the town also includes the smaller communities of Ballinafad, Brisbane, Cedar Valley, Crewson&#x27;s Corners, Orton and Ospringe as well as Hillsburgh, an urban centre. The population in 2016 was 12,400. The town also includes rural cluster areas such as Binkham, Churchill (partially), Coningsby and Mimosa.

==History==
The first settlers of European descent in the area then known as Erin Township were George and Nathaniel Roszel from Pennsylvania who arrived in November 1820; Nathanial acquired land in what is now Ballinafad. (Most of the settlers during the township&#x27;s development were Scottish.) In 1821, William How and his family arrived from England and built a home in what is now Hillsburgh; he started the first general store in that community. The first Township Meeting was held on January 5, 1824; Henry Trout Sr. was appointed Town Clerk. The township halls have always been in or near Hillsburgh. The township population grew over the years from 1,368 in 1841, to 3,055 in 1850 when 15,400 acres were under cultivation.

The urban community now called Erin developed after mills were built on the Credit River between 1826 and 1829. The first settlers included Daniel MacMillan and the Trout family. The settlement was established as &quot;MacMillan&#x27;s Mills&quot; although most sources indicate that the Trout family built the first sawmill. Even so, Daniel MacMillan and his brothers are acknowledged as significant contributors to the growth of the village.

By 1839 a post-office had opened. Records from 1841 indicate that the entire Township of Erin had a population of just 1,368. By 1846, the small settlement in the south-west of the township, then called McMillen&#x27;s Mills, had a grist and saw mill, a tavern and blacksmith&#x27;s shop but only 40 to 50 residents.

In 1849, the first place of worship, the Union Church was being used by several denominations. Previously, services had been held in homes and in other available buildings. By 1851, the population increased to 300; the name of the settlement was Erinsville at the time but was later shortened to Erin. Businesses in the area included a distillery, a tannery, and carding, oatmeal and grist-mills. The river provided the power for mills, helping to boost agriculture, milling and wood products manufacturing. By 1869 the population was 600 and the post office was receiving mail daily.

The Credit Valley Railway reached Erin in 1879 and the same year, Erin was incorporated as a village. At the time the population was 750.

Electricity from small private providers became available before 1890 and a formal power company was established in 1900, Cataract Light &amp; Power. Hydro power was generated at Cataract, in Caledon, an area that is now in the Forks of the Credit Provincial Park. That facility was sold to Ontario Hydro in 1944 and continued to operate until 1947.

<doc id="374657" wikidata="Q5363662" url="?curid=374657" title="Elizabeth Van Lew">
<text>Elizabeth Van Lew (October 12, 1818 – September 25, 1900) was an American abolitionist, Southern Unionist, and philanthropist who recruited and acted as the primary handler of an extensive spy ring for the Union Army in the Confederate capital of Richmond during the American Civil War. Many false claims continue to be made about her life. The single most reliable source is a 2002 biography by University of Virginia professor Elizabeth R. Varon.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Van Lew was born on October 12, 1818, in Richmond, Virginia. Her father was John Van Lew and Eliza Baker was her mother. Her maternal grandfather was Hilary Baker, mayor of Philadelphia from 1796 to 1798. John Van Lew came to Richmond in 1806, at the age of 16; within 20 years, he had built up a prosperous hardware business and owned several slaves.

Van Lew was educated in Philadelphia. The Quaker school she attended is thought to have been influential in forming her anti-slavery views. Following her father&#x27;s death in 1843, Van Lew and her mother continued to live in the family&#x27;s home in Richmond. John Van Lew&#x27;s will stipulated that none of the family&#x27;s enslaved human property could be freed. However, Elizabeth and her mother helped the slaves in their household to earn wages and a measure of freedom. While the Van Lew family benefited from slavery, she believed it would eventually fade away. Her hope was that Southerners would free their slaves and that emancipation by manumission would gradually end the practice that she viewed as abhorrent and destructive to the South.

==American Civil War==
Upon the outbreak of the war, Van Lew began working on behalf of the Union with her mother, caring for wounded soldiers. When Libby Prison was opened in Richmond, Van Lew was allowed to bring food, clothing, writing paper, and other things to the Union soldiers imprisoned there. She aided prisoners in escape attempts, passing them information about safe houses and getting a Union sympathizer appointed to the prison staff. Van Lew reportedly helped Union soldiers by giving them money to bribe Confederates.

Recently captured prisoners gave Van Lew information on Confederate troop levels and movements, which she passed on to Union commanders. She is rumored to have helped hide escaped Union prisoners and Confederate deserters in her own mansion, although no definite proof of such claims has been found.

Van Lew also operated a spy ring during the war, which included clerks in the War and Navy Departments of the Confederacy, as well as free and enslaved African Americans, including Mary Richards Bowser. Mary Jane Richards, aka Mary Elizabeth Bowser, was reputedly a formerly enslaved maid in the Van Lew household, and was sent by the family to be educated in a Quaker school in Pennsylvania. She might have used the alias Mary Elizabeth Bowser to conceal her identity. Stories surfaced about the woman having possibly served as a maid for Jefferson Davis, while spying for the Union. She herself admitted to having served as a detective during the war. The spy ring eventually became official agents of the Union when General Benjamin Butler, having heard about Van Lew from two escaped Union Prisoners of War, recruited her to work for the US government.

Van Lew&#x27;s spy network was so efficient that on several occasions she sent Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant fresh flowers from her garden and a copy of the Richmond newspaper. She developed a cipher system and often smuggled messages out of Richmond in hollow eggs. Union commanders highly valued Van Lew&#x27;s work; intelligence commander George H. Sharpe, Army of the Potomac, recommended that the government reimburse Van Lew $15,000 because of the great expense she incurred in her efforts, including employment of spies. Because of the merit of her work, General Grant appointed Van Lew Postmaster General of Richmond for the next eight years.

In 1864, Van Lew risked her entire spy network to see that the corpse of Union Col. Ulric Dahlgren, who died trying to free Union prisoners in Richmond, was properly buried. Reports of disrespectful display of his corpse had outraged Northern public opinion, and Van Lew herself. After the siege of Petersburg, Van Lew assisted civilians of both sides.

==Postwar life==
When Richmond fell to U.S. forces in April 1865, Van Lew was the first person to raise the United States flag in the city.

On Grant&#x27;s first visit to Richmond after the war, he had tea with Van Lew, and later appointed her postmaster of Richmond. Van Lew modernized the city&#x27;s postal system and employed several African Americans, with the same pay and benefits as white employees, until new President Rutherford B. Hayes had her replaced in 1877. She was allowed to return as a postal clerk in Richmond, where she served from 1883 to 1887.

After Reconstruction, Van Lew became increasingly ostracized in Richmond. &quot;No one will walk with us on the street,&quot; she wrote, &quot;no one will go with us anywhere; and it grows worse and worse as the years roll on.&quot; Having spent her family&#x27;s fortune on intelligence activities during the war, she tried in vain to be reimbursed by the federal government. When attempts to secure a government pension also failed, she received support from the family and friends of Union Col. Paul Joseph Revere, whom she had helped while he was held prisoner during the Civil War. These Bostonians gladly collected money for the woman who helped so many Union soldiers during the war. However, neighborhood children, including future novelist Ellen Glasgow, were told to consider her a witch. Even into the twentieth century, many white Southerners regarded Van Lew as a traitor. However, among Richmonders of color and white Unionists, Van Lew was an honored figure.

==Death and legacy==
Van Lew died on September 25, 1900 (aged 81), and was buried in Richmond&#x27;s Shockoe Hill Cemetery in the same grave as her niece Eliza Van Lew, who had been her constant companion in her later years, and who had died just a few months before her. Elizabeth was purportedly buried vertically, facing the north; however, this is highly unlikely, as Cemetery records do not reflect that circumstance, and such a burial would have been unnecessary as multiple persons were often buried in a common grave shaft in that era. Relatives of Union Colonel Paul J. Revere, whom she had aided during the war, donated the tombstone. The epitaph reads: &quot;ELIZABETH L. VAN LEW (1818 - 1900) She risked everything that is dear to man-- friends-- fortune-- comfort-- health-- life itself-- that slavery might be abolished and the Union preserved. This boulder from the Capitol Hill in Boston is a tribute from Massachusetts friends.&quot; 

In her will, Van Lew bequeathed her personal manuscripts, including her account of the war, to John P. Reynolds, Col. Revere&#x27;s nephew. In 1911, Reynolds convinced the scholar William G. Beymer to publish the first biography of Van Lew in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot;. The biography indicated that Van Lew had been so successful in her spying activities because she had feigned lunacy, and this idea won Van Lew the nickname &quot;Crazy Bet&quot;. However, it is highly unlikely that Van Lew actually did pretend to be crazy. Instead, she likely relied on the Victorian custom of female charity to cover her espionage.

The city of Richmond acquired and demolished the Van Lew mansion, her former home, in 1911. Bellevue Elementary School (which still remains) was erected on the site the following year. Historical plaques and a marker now memorialize her activities, and those of Bowser (aka Mary Jane Richards). Furthermore, the daughter of two of Van Lew&#x27;s servants, Maggie Walker, became a prominent Christian entrepreneur in Richmond, founding the country&#x27;s first African-American-woman owned bank.

Elizabeth Van Lew was inducted into the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame in 1993.

== Books and films ==
Elizabeth Van Lew was an insignificant character in the 1944 book &quot;Yankee Stranger&quot; by Elswyth Thane, the second in her Williamsburg series, and a character in &quot;The Secrets of Mary Bowser&quot;, a novel by Lois Leveen. Her story was also fictionalized in 1995 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Secret of the Lion&#x27;s Head&quot; by Beverly Hall, the 2005 novel &quot;Elizabeth Van Lew: Civil War Spy&quot; by Heidi Schoof, the 2006 novel &quot;Only Call Us Faithful: A Novel of the Union Underground&quot; by Marie Jakober, the 2013 novel &quot;The Spymistress&quot; by Jennifer Chiaverini. and the 2016 novel &quot;Crazy Bet and the Gentleman from Massachusetts&quot; by Frederick Lapisardi.

The 1987 television movie &quot;A Special Friendship&quot; tells a fictionalized story of the friendship and pro-Union collaboration of Van Lew (who is presented as a young, rather than middle-aged, woman in the film) and her former slave Mary Bowser. The 1990 television movie &quot;Traitor in My House&quot; tells the story of Elizabeth Van Lew from the perspective of her niece; Mary Kay Place portrays Elizabeth.

A fictionalized, but heavily researched, account of Elizabeth Van Lew&#x27;s work during the Civil War is included in Karen Abbott&#x27;s 2015 novel, &quot;Liar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy: Four Women Undercover in the Civil War&quot;. The title of Abbott&#x27;s novel pays homage to British novelist and former spy John le Carré&#x27;s Cold War thriller &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, because all four women were amateur spies.

<text>Cupressaceae or the cypress family is a family of conifers. The family includes 27–30 genera (17 monotypic), which include the junipers and redwoods, with about 130–140 species in total. They are monoecious, subdioecious or (rarely) dioecious trees and shrubs up to tall. The bark of mature trees is commonly orange- to red-brown and of stringy texture, often flaking or peeling in vertical strips, but smooth, scaly or hard and square-cracked in some species. The family reached its peak of diversity during the Mesozoic era.

==Description==
The leaves are arranged either spirally, in decussate pairs (opposite pairs, each pair at 90° to the previous pair) or in decussate whorls of three or four, depending on the genus. On young plants, the leaves are needle-like, becoming small and scale-like on mature plants of many genera; some genera and species retain needle-like leaves throughout their lives. Old leaves are mostly not shed individually, but in small sprays of foliage (cladoptosis); exceptions are leaves on the shoots that develop into branches. These leaves eventually fall off individually when the bark starts to flake. Most are evergreen with the leaves persisting 2–10 years, but three genera (&quot;Glyptostrobus&quot;, &quot;Metasequoia&quot; and &quot;Taxodium&quot;) are deciduous or include deciduous species.

The seed cones are either woody, leathery, or (in &quot;Juniperus&quot;) berry-like and fleshy, with one to several ovules per scale. The bract scale and ovuliferous scale are fused together except at the apex, where the bract scale is often visible as a short spine (often called an umbo) on the ovuliferous scale. As with the foliage, the cone scales are arranged spirally, decussate (opposite) or whorled, depending on the genus. The seeds are mostly small and somewhat flattened, with two narrow wings, one down each side of the seed; rarely (e.g. &quot;Actinostrobus&quot;) triangular in section with three wings; in some genera (e.g. &quot;Glyptostrobus&quot; and &quot;Libocedrus&quot;), one of the wings is significantly larger than the other, and in some others (e.g. &quot;Juniperus&quot;, &quot;Microbiota&quot;, &quot;Platycladus&quot;, and &quot;Taxodium&quot;) the seed is larger and wingless. The seedlings usually have two cotyledons, but in some species up to six. The pollen cones are more uniform in structure across the family, 1–20 mm long, with the scales again arranged spirally, decussate (opposite) or whorled, depending on the genus; they may be borne singly at the apex of a shoot (most genera), in the leaf axils (&quot;Cryptomeria&quot;), in dense clusters (&quot;Cunninghamia&quot; and &quot;Juniperus drupacea&quot;), or on discrete long pendulous panicle-like shoots (&quot;Metasequoia&quot; and &quot;Taxodium&quot;).

Cupressaceae is a widely distributed conifer family, with a near-global range in all continents except for Antarctica, stretching from 70°N in arctic Norway (&quot;Juniperus communis&quot;) to 55°S in southernmost Chile (&quot;Pilgerodendron uviferum&quot;), further south than any other conifer species. &quot;Juniperus indica&quot; reaches 4930 m altitude in Tibet. Most habitats on land are occupied, with the exceptions of polar tundra and tropical lowland rainforest (though several species are important components of temperate rainforests and tropical highland cloud forests); they are also rare in deserts, with only a few species able to tolerate severe drought, notably &quot;Cupressus dupreziana&quot; in the central Sahara. Despite the wide overall distribution, many genera and species show very restricted relictual distributions, and many are endangered species.

The world&#x27;s largest (&quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot;) and current tallest (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) trees belong to the Cupressaceae, as do six of the ten longest-lived tree species.

==Classification==

Molecular and morphological studies have expanded Cupressaceae to include the genera of Taxodiaceae, previously treated as a distinct family, but now shown not to differ from the Cupressaceae in any consistent characteristics. The member genera have been placed into five distinct subfamilies of Cupressaceae, Athrotaxidoideae, Cunninghamioideae, Sequoioideae, Taiwanioideae, and Taxodioideae, which form a grade basal to Cupressaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, containing Callitroideae and Cupressoideae. The former Taxodiaceae genus, &quot;Sciadopitys&quot;, has been moved to a separate monotypic family Sciadopityaceae due to being genetically distinct from the rest of the Cupressaceae. In some classifications Cupressaceae is raised to an order, Cupressales. Molecular evidence supports Cupressaceae being the sister group to the yews (family Taxaceae), from which it diverged during the early-mid Triassic. The clade comprising both is sister to Sciadopityaceae, which diverged from them during the early-mid Permian. The oldest definitive record of Cupressaceae is &quot;Austrohamia minuta&quot; from the Early Jurassic (Pliensbachian) of Patagonia, known from many parts of the plant. The reproductive structures of &quot;Austrohamia&quot; have strong similarities to those of the primitive living cypress genera &quot;Taiwania&quot; and &quot;Cunninghamia.&quot; By the Middle to Late Jurassic Cupressaceae were abundant in warm temperate–tropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The diversity of the group continued to increase during the Cretaceous period. The earliest appearance of the non-taxodiaceous Cupressaceae (the clade containing Callitroideae and Cupressoideae) is in the mid-Cretaceous, represented by &quot;&quot;Widdringtonia&quot; americana&quot; from the Cenomanian of North America, and they subsequently diversified during the Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic.

The family is divided into seven subfamilies, based on genetic and morphological analysis as follows:
* Subfamily Cunninghamioideae 
** &quot;Cunninghamia&quot; 
** &quot;Elatides&quot; Middle Jurassic- Early Cretaceous, Eurasia (possibly North America)

** &quot;Mikasostrobus&quot; Late Cretaceous, Japan
** &quot;Parataiwania&quot; Late Cretaceous, Japan
** &quot;Ohanastrobus&quot; Late Cretaceous, Japan
** &quot;Nishidastrobus&quot; Late Cretaceous, Japan
** &quot;Cunninghamiostrobus&quot; Early Cretaceous-Oligocene Japan, North America

** &quot;Sequoia&quot; – coast redwood
** &quot;Sequoiadendron&quot; – giant sequoia
* Subfamily Taxodioideae 
** &quot;Cryptomeria&quot; – sugi
** &quot;Glyptostrobus&quot; – Chinese swamp cypress
** &quot;Taxodium&quot; – bald cypress
* Subfamily Callitroideae 
** &quot;Actinostrobus&quot; – cypress-pine
** &quot;Austrocedrus&quot; 
** &quot;Callitris&quot; – cypress-pine
** &quot;Diselma&quot; 
** &quot;Fitzroya&quot; – alerce
** &quot;Libocedrus&quot; 
** &quot;Neocallitropsis&quot; 
** &quot;Papuacedrus&quot; 
** &quot;Pilgerodendron&quot; 
** &quot;Widdringtonia&quot; 
* Subfamily Cupressoideae 
** &quot; Callitropsis&quot; – Nootka cypress
** &quot;Calocedrus&quot; – incense-cedar
** &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot; – cypress
** &quot;Cupressus&quot; – cypress
** &quot;Fokienia&quot; – Fujian cypress
** &quot;Hesperocyparis&quot; 
** &quot;Juniperus&quot; – juniper
** &quot;Microbiota&quot; 
** &quot;Platycladus&quot; – Chinese arborvitae
** &quot;Tetraclinis&quot; 
** &quot;Thuja&quot; – thuja or arborvitae
** &quot;Thujopsis&quot; – hiba
** &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; – cypress
A 2010 study of &quot;Actinostrobus&quot; and &quot;Callitris&quot; places the three species of &quot;Actinostrobus&quot; within an expanded &quot;Callitris&quot; based on analysis of 42 morphological and anatomical characters.

Phylogeny based on 2000 study of morphological and molecular data. Several further papers have suggested the segregation &quot;Cupressus&quot; species into four total genera.
A 2021 molecular study supported a very similar phylogeny but with some slight differences, along with the splitting of &quot;Cupressus&quot; (found to be paraphyletic):
==Uses==
Many of the species are important timber sources, especially in the genera &quot;Calocedrus&quot;, &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot;, &quot;Cryptomeria&quot;, &quot;Cunninghamia&quot;, &quot;Cupressus&quot;, &quot;Sequoia&quot;, &quot;Taxodium&quot;, and &quot;Thuja&quot;. &quot;Calocedrus decurrens&quot; is the main wood used to make wooden pencils, and is also used in chests, paneling, and flooring. In China, cypress wood known as &quot;baimu&quot; or &quot;bomu&quot;, was carved into furniture, using notably &quot;Cupressus funebris&quot;, and particularly in tropical areas, Fujian cypress and the aromatic wood of &quot;Glyptostrobus pensilis&quot;. &quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot; has used by Native Americans for waymarking. Its heartwood is fragrant and used in clothes chests, drawers and closets to repel moths. It is a source of juniper oil used in perfumes and medicines. The wood is also used as long lasting fenceposts and for bows.

Several genera are important in horticulture. Junipers are planted as evergreen trees, shrubs, and groundcovers. Hundreds of cultivars have been developed, including plants with blue, grey, or yellow foliage. &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot; and &quot;Thuja&quot; also provide hundreds of dwarf cultivars as well as trees, including Lawson&#x27;s cypress. Dawn redwood is widely planted as an ornamental tree because of its excellent horticultural qualities, rapid growth and status as a living fossil. Giant sequoia is a popular ornamental tree and is occasionally grown for timber. Giant sequoia, Leyland cypress, and Arizona cypress are grown to a small extent as Christmas trees.

Some species have significant cultural importance. The ahuehuete (&quot;Taxodium mucronatum&quot;) is the national tree of Mexico. Coast redwood and giant sequoia were jointly designated the state tree of California, and are major tourist attractions where they grow naturally. Parks such as Redwood National and State Parks and Giant Sequoia National Monument protect almost half the remaining stands of Coast Redwoods and Giant sequoias. Bald cypress is the state tree of Louisiana. Bald cypress, often festooned with Spanish moss, of southern swamps are another tourist attraction. They can be seen at Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida. Bald cypress &quot;knees&quot; are often sold as souvenirs, made into lamps, or carved to make folk art. Monterey cypresses are often visited by tourists and photographers, particularly a tree known as the Lone Cypress.

The fleshy cones of &quot;Juniperus communis&quot; are used to flavour gin.

Native Americans and early European explorers used &quot;Thuja&quot; leaves as a cure for scurvy. Distillation of &quot;Fokienia&quot; roots produces an essential oil called pemou oil used in medicine and cosmetics.

Recent progress on Endophyte Biology in Cupressaceae, by the groups of Jalal Soltani (Bu-Ali Sina University) and Elizabeth Arnold (Arizona University) have revealed prevalent symbioses of endophytes and endofungal bacteria with family Cupressaceae. Furthermore, current and potential uses of Cupressaceous tree&#x27;s endophytes in agroforestry and medicine is shown by both groups.

==Chemistry==
The Cupressaceae trees contain a wide range of extractives, especially terpenes and terpenoids, both of which have strong and often pleasant odors.

The heartwood, bark and leaves are the tree parts richest in terpenes. Some of these compounds are widely distributed in other trees as well, and some are typical for Cupressaceae family. The most known terpenoids found in conifers are sesquiterpenoids, diterpenes and tropolones. Diterpenes are commonly found in different types of conifers and are not typical for this family. Some sesquiterpenoids (e.g. bisabolanes, cubenanes, guaianes, ylanganes, himachalanes, longifolanes, longibornanes, longipinanes, cedranes, thujopsanes) also present in Pinaceae, Podocarpaceae and Taxodiaceae. Meanwhile, chamigranes, cuparanes, widdranes and acoranes are more distinctive for Cupressaceae. Tropolone derivatives, such as nootkatin, chanootin, thujaplicinol and hinokitiol are particularly characteristic for Cupressaceae.

==Disease vectors==
Several genera are an alternate host of &quot;Gymnosporangium&quot; rust, which damages apples and other related trees in the subfamily Maloideae.

==Allergenicity==
The pollen of many genera of Cupressaceae is allergenic, causing major hay fever problems in areas where they are abundant, most notably by &quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot; (&quot;sugi&quot;) pollen in Japan. Highly allergenic species of cypress with an OPALS allergy scale rating of 8 out of 10 or higher include: &quot;Taxodium&quot;, &quot;Cupressus&quot;, &quot;Callitris&quot;, &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot;, and the males and monoicous variants of &quot;Austrocedrus&quot; and &quot;Widdringtonia&quot;. However, the females of some species have a very low potential for causing allergies (an OPALS allergy scale rating of 2 or lower) including &quot;Austrocedrus&quot; females and &quot;Widdringtonia&quot; females.

<text>In object-oriented programming such as is often used in C++ and Object Pascal, a virtual function or virtual method is an inheritable and overridable function or method that is dispatched dynamically. Virtual functions are an important part of (runtime) polymorphism in object-oriented programming (OOP). They allow for the execution of target functions that were not precisely identified at compile time.

Most programming languages, such as JavaScript, PHP and Python, treat all methods as virtual by default and do not provide a modifier to change this behavior. However, some languages provide modifiers to prevent methods from being overridden by derived classes (such as the &quot;final&quot; and &quot;private&quot; keywords in Java and PHP).

== Purpose ==

The concept of the virtual function solves the following problem:

In object-oriented programming, when a derived class inherits from a base class, an object of the derived class may be referred to via a pointer or reference of the base class type instead of the derived class type. If there are base class methods overridden by the derived class, the method actually called by such a reference or pointer can be bound (linked) either &quot;early&quot; (by the compiler), according to the declared type of the pointer or reference, or &quot;late&quot; (i.e., by the runtime system of the language), according to the actual type of the object referred to.

Virtual functions are resolved &quot;late&quot;. If the function in question is &quot;virtual&quot; in the base class, the most-derived class&#x27;s implementation of the function is called according to the actual type of the object referred to, regardless of the declared type of the pointer or reference. If it is not &quot;virtual&quot;, the method is resolved &quot;early&quot; and selected according to the declared type of the pointer or reference.

Virtual functions allow a program to call methods that don&#x27;t necessarily even exist at the moment the code is compiled.

In C++, &quot;virtual methods&quot; are declared by prepending the keyword to the function&#x27;s declaration in the base class. This modifier is inherited by all implementations of that method in derived classes, meaning that they can continue to over-ride each other and be late-bound. And even if methods owned by the base class call the virtual method, they will instead be calling the derived method. &quot;Overloading&quot; occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters. &quot;Overriding&quot; means having two methods with the same method name and parameters. Overloading is also referred to as function matching, and overriding as dynamic function mapping.

== Example ==

=== C++ ===

For example, a base class codice_1 could have a virtual function codice_2. Subclass codice_3 would implement codice_2 differently than subclass codice_5, but one can invoke codice_2 on any class instance referred to as Animal, and get the codice_2 behavior of the specific subclass.
class Animal {
 public:
 // Intentionally not virtual:
 void Move() {
 std::cout « &quot;This animal moves in some way&quot; « std::endl;
 virtual void Eat() = 0;

// The class &quot;Animal&quot; may possess a definition for Eat if desired.
class Llama : public Animal {
 public:
 // The non virtual function Move is inherited but not overridden.
 void Eat() override {
 std::cout « &quot;Llamas eat grass!&quot; « std::endl;
};
This allows a programmer to process a list of objects of class codice_1, telling each in turn to eat (by calling codice_2), without needing to know what kind of animal may be in the list, how each animal eats, or what the complete set of possible animal types might be.

In C, the mechanism behind virtual functions could be provided in the following manner:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* an object points to its class... */
struct Animal {
 const struct AnimalVTable *vtable;

/* which contains the virtual function Animal.Eat */
struct AnimalVTable {
 void (*Eat)(struct Animal *self); // &#x27;virtual&#x27; function 

 Since Animal.Move is not a virtual function
 it is not in the structure above.
void Move(const struct Animal *self) {
 printf(&quot;&lt;Animal at %p&gt; moved in some way\n&quot;, ( void* )(self));

 unlike Move, which executes Animal.Move directly,
 Eat cannot know which function (if any) to call at compile time.
 Animal.Eat can only be resolved at run time when Eat is called.
void Eat(struct Animal *self) {
 const struct AnimalVTable *vtable = *( const void** )(self);
 if (vtable-&gt;Eat != NULL) { 
 (*vtable-&gt;Eat)(self); // execute Animal.Eat
 } else {
 fprintf(stderr, &quot;&#x27;Eat&#x27; virtual method not implemented\n&quot;);
}
 implementation of Llama.Eat this is the target function 
 to be called by &#x27;void Eat(struct Animal *self).&#x27;
static void _Llama_eat(struct Animal *self) {
 printf(&quot;&lt;Llama at %p&gt; Llamas eat grass!\n&quot;, ( void* )(self)); 

/* initialize class */
const struct AnimalVTable Animal = { NULL }; // base class does not implement Animal.Eat
const struct AnimalVTable Llama = { _Llama_eat }; // but the derived class does

int main(void) {
 /* init objects as instance of its class */
 struct Animal animal = { &amp;Animal };
 struct Animal llama = { &amp;Llama };
 Move(&amp;animal); // Animal.Move
 Move(&amp;llama); // Llama.Move
 Eat(&amp;animal); // cannot resolve Animal.Eat so print &quot;Not Implemented&quot; to stderr
 Eat(&amp;llama); // resolves Llama.Eat and executes


== Abstract classes and pure virtual functions ==
A pure virtual function or pure virtual method is a virtual function that is required to be implemented by a derived class if the derived class is not abstract. Classes containing pure virtual methods are termed &quot;abstract&quot; and they cannot be instantiated directly. A subclass of an abstract class can only be instantiated directly if all inherited pure virtual methods have been implemented by that class or a parent class. Pure virtual methods typically have a declaration (signature) and no definition (implementation).

As an example, an abstract base class codice_10 may provide a pure virtual function codice_11, and derived classes codice_12 and codice_13 implement codice_11 to provide concrete implementations. Implementing codice_11 would not make sense in the codice_10 class, as codice_10 is an abstract concept whose behaviour is defined solely for each given kind (subclass) of codice_10. Similarly, a given subclass of codice_10 would not be complete without an implementation of
codice_11.

Although pure virtual methods typically have no implementation in the class that declares them, pure virtual methods in some languages (e.g. C++ and Python) are permitted to contain an implementation in their declaring class, providing fallback or default behaviour that a derived class can delegate to, if appropriate.

Pure virtual functions can also be used where the method declarations are being used to define an interface - similar to what the interface keyword in Java explicitly specifies. In such a use, derived classes will supply all implementations. In such a design pattern, the abstract class which serves as an interface will contain &quot;only&quot; pure virtual functions, but no data members or ordinary methods. In C++, using such purely abstract classes as interfaces works because C++ supports multiple inheritance. However, because many OOP languages do not support multiple inheritance, they often provide a separate interface mechanism. An example is the Java programming language.

== Behavior during construction and destruction ==
Languages differ in their behavior while the constructor or destructor of an object is running. For this reason, calling virtual functions in constructors is generally discouraged.

In C++, the &quot;base&quot; function is called. Specifically, the most derived function that is not more derived than the current constructor or destructor&#x27;s class is called. If that function is a pure virtual function, then undefined behavior occurs. This is true even if the class contains an implementation for that pure virtual function, since a call to a pure virtual function must be explicitly qualified. A conforming C++ implementation is not required (and generally not able) to detect indirect calls to pure virtual functions at compile time or link time. Some runtime systems will issue a pure virtual function call error when encountering a call to a pure virtual function at run time.

In Java and C#, the derived implementation is called, but some fields are not yet initialized by the derived constructor (although they are initialized to their default zero values). Some design patterns, such as the Abstract Factory Pattern, actively promote this usage in languages supporting this ability.

== Virtual destructors ==
Object-oriented languages typically manage memory allocation and de-allocation automatically when objects are created and destroyed. However, some object-oriented languages allow a custom destructor method to be implemented, if desired. If the language in question uses automatic memory management, the custom destructor (generally called a finalizer in this context) that is called is certain to be the appropriate one for the object in question. For example, if an object of type Wolf that inherits Animal is created, and both have custom destructors, the one called will be the one declared in Wolf.

In manual memory management contexts, the situation can be more complex, particularly in relation to static dispatch. If an object of type Wolf is created but pointed to by an Animal pointer, and it is this Animal pointer type that is deleted, the destructor called may actually be the one defined for Animal and not the one for Wolf, unless the destructor is virtual. This is particularly the case with C++, where the behavior is a common source of programming errors if destructors are not virtual.

<doc id="374666" wikidata="Q7590512" url="?curid=374666" title="St. Mary River (Alberta–Montana)">
<text>The Saint Mary River (), is a cross-border tributary of the Oldman River, itself a tributary of the South Saskatchewan River. The Saint Mary together with the Belly River and Waterton River drains a small portion of Montana, in the United States, to the Hudson Bay watershed in Canada.

The river rises as a stream on Gunsight Mountain in Glacier National Park and flows into Gunsight Lake, then flows into Saint Mary Lake, exits the park and flows on into Lower St. Mary Lake in the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. From the reservation, the St. Mary River flows into Alberta and into the St. Mary Reservoir. It flows into the Oldman River which eventually reaches the Saskatchewan River.

It passes near the town of Cardston, Alberta, and the city of Lethbridge, Alberta.

==Irrigation==

The St. Mary River also provides water for irrigation in Southern Alberta. The St. Mary River Irrigation District (SMRID) is Canada’s largest irrigation district delivering water through of canals and pipelines to approximately of land south of the Oldman and South Saskatchewan Rivers between Lethbridge and Medicine Hat.

The irrigation project was started in 1898, and on September 4, 1900, the first water was brought to Lethbridge by the project. In December 1945 the Canadian Pacific Railway transferred control of the projects to the government of Alberta, creating the St. Mary and Milk River Development (SMRD). A dam was created in 1946 on the St. Mary River, to service the irrigation system, and water finally reached Medicine Hat in 1954 upon the completion of the St. Mary Main Canal.

<doc id="374669" wikidata="Q1199356" url="?curid=374669" title="Standard library">
<text>In computer programming, a standard library is the library made available across implementations of a programming language. Often, a standard library is specified by its associated programming language specification, however, some are set in part or whole by more informal practices of a language community.

Some languages define a core part of the standard library that must be made available in all implementations while allowing other parts to be implemented optionally.

As defined with the core language aspects, the line between the core language and its standard library is relatively subtle. A programmer may confuse the two aspects even though the language designers intentionally separate the two.

The line between the core language and its standard library is further blurred in some languages by defining core language constructs in terms of its standard library. For example, Java defines a string literal as an instance of the java.lang.String class. Smalltalk defines an anonymous function expression (a &quot;block&quot;) as an instance of its library&#x27;s BlockContext class. Scheme does not specify which portions must be implemented as core language vs. standard library.

==Contents==
Depending on the constructs available in the core language, a standard library may include:

*Subroutines
*Macro definitions
*Global variables
*Class definitions
*Templates

Commonly provided functionality includes:

*Algorithms; such as sorting algorithms
*Data structures; such as list, tree, and hash table
*Interaction with external systems; input/output
*Interaction with the host operating system

==Philosophies==
Philosophies of standard library design vary widely. For example, Bjarne Stroustrup, designer of C++, writes:
This suggests a relatively small standard library, containing only the constructs that &quot;every programmer&quot; might reasonably require when building a large collection of software. This is the philosophy that is used in the C and C++ standard libraries.

By contrast, Guido van Rossum, designer of Python, has embraced a much more inclusive vision of the standard library. Python attempts to offer an easy-to-code, object-oriented, high-level language. In the Python tutorial, he writes:
Van Rossum goes on to list libraries for processing XML, XML-RPC, email messages, and localization, facilities that the C++ standard library omits. This other philosophy is often found in scripting languages (as in Python or Ruby) or languages that use a virtual machine, such as Java or the .NET Framework languages. In C++, such facilities are not part of the standard library, but instead are included in other libraries, such as Boost.

==Examples==
*C standard library
*C++ standard library
*.NET Framework Class Library (FCL)
*Java Class Library (JCL)
*Factor standard library
*Ruby standard library
*Python standard library
*Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) standard libraries

<text>A mountain pass is a navigable route through a mountain range or over a ridge. Since mountain ranges can present formidable barriers to travel, passes have played a key role in trade, war, and both human and animal migration throughout history. At lower elevations it may be called a hill pass. A mountain pass is typically formed between two volcanic peaks or created by erosion from water or wind.

== Overview ==

Mountain passes make use of a gap, saddle, col or notch. A topographic saddle is analogous to the mathematical concept of a saddle surface, with a saddle point marking the minimum high point between two valleys and the lowest point along a ridge. On a topographic map, passes can be identified by contour lines with an hourglass shape, which indicates a low spot between two higher points. In the high mountains, a difference of between the summit and the mountain is defined as a mountain pass.

Passes are often found just above the source of a river, constituting a drainage divide. A pass may be very short, consisting of steep slopes to the top of the pass, or a valley many kilometers long, whose highest point might only be identifiable by surveying.

Roads and railways have long been built through passes. Some high and rugged passes may have tunnels bored underneath a nearby mountainside, as with the Eisenhower Tunnel bypassing Loveland Pass in the Rockies, to allow faster traffic flow throughout the year.

The top of a pass is frequently the only flat ground in the area, and may be a high vantage point. In some cases this makes it a preferred site for buildings. If a national border follows the ridge of a mountain range, a pass over the mountains is typically on the border, and there may be a border control or customs station, and possibly a military post. For instance, Argentina and Chile share the world&#x27;s third-longest international border, long, which runs north–south along the Andes mountains and includes 42 mountain passes. 

On a road over a pass, it is customary to have a small roadside sign giving the name of the pass and its elevation above mean sea level.

Apart from offering relatively easy travel between valleys, passes also provide a route between two mountain tops with a minimum of descent. As a result, it is common for tracks to meet at a pass; this often makes them convenient routes even when travelling between a summit and the valley floor. Passes traditionally were places for trade routes, communications, cultural exchange, military expeditions etc. A typical example is the Brenner pass in the Alps.

Some mountain passes above the tree line have problems with snow drift in the winter. This might be alleviated by building the road a few meters above the ground, which will make snow blow off the road.

== Synonyms ==

There are many words for &quot;pass&quot; in the English-speaking world. In the United States, &quot;pass&quot; is very common in the West, the word &quot;gap&quot; is common in the southern Appalachians, &quot;notch&quot; in parts of New England, and &quot;saddle&quot; in northern Idaho. The term col, derived from Old French, is also used, particularly in Europe.

In the highest mountain range in the world, the Himalayas, passes are denoted by the suffix &quot;La&quot; in Tibetan, Ladhakhi, and several other regional languages. Examples are the Taglang La at 5,328 m (17,480 ft) on the Leh-Manali highway, and the Sia La at 5,589 m (18,337 ft) in the Eastern Karakoram range.

Scotland has the Gaelic term &quot;bealach&quot; (anglicised &quot;balloch&quot;), while Wales has the similar &quot;bwlch&quot; (both being insular Celtic languages). In the Lake District of north-west England, the term &quot;hause&quot; is often used, although the term &quot;pass&quot; is also common—one distinction is that a pass can refer to a route, as well as the highest part thereof, while a hause is simply that highest part, often flattened somewhat into a high-level plateau.

In Japan they are known as &quot;tōge&quot;, which means &quot;pass&quot; in Japanese. The word can also refer to narrow, winding roads that can be found in and around mountains and geographically similar areas, or specifically to a style of street racing which may take place on these roads.

== Around the world ==
There are thousands of named passes around the world, some of which are well-known, such as the Khyber Pass close to the present-day Afghanistan-Pakistan border on the ancient Silk Road, the Great St. Bernard Pass at in the Alps, the Chang La at , the Khardung La at in Ladakh, India and the Palakkad Gap at in Palakkad, Kerala, India. The roads at Mana Pass at and Marsimik La at , on and near the China–India border respectively, appear to be world&#x27;s two highest motorable passes. Khunjerab Pass between Pakistan and China at is also a high-altitude motorable mountain pass. One of the famous but non-motorable mountain passes is Thorong La at in Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal.

<text>Sir-Tech Software, Inc. was a video game developer and publisher based in the United States and Canada.

==History==
In fall 1979, Sirotech Software was founded by Norman Sirotek, Robert Sirotek and Robert Woodhead. Sirotech Software published &quot;Info Tree&quot;, a database management program, &quot;Galactic Attack&quot; and a beta version of &quot;Wizardry: Dungeons of Despair&quot; which was later renamed &quot;&quot; and formally released in fall 1981. It was the first game in the &quot;Wizardry&quot; series.

In spring 1981, Sir-Tech Software, Inc was incorporated as a video game developer and publisher in the United States.

In 1998, Sir-Tech USA closed. The Canadian counterpart, Sirtech Canada Limited, continued to operate until late 2003.

Sir-Tech is best known for &quot;Wizardry&quot;, the role-playing video game series. The &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; series, first published by Sir-Tech in 1994, became a popular franchise. The third game in the series, &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot;, was still available from its current publisher 15 years after its initial release.

<doc id="374683" wikidata="Q1055478" url="?curid=374683" title="Kamarinskaya">
<text>Kamarinskaya () is a traditional Russian folk dance, which is mostly known today as the Russian composer Mikhail Glinka&#x27;s composition of the same name. Glinka&#x27;s &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot;, written in 1848, was the first orchestral work based entirely on Russian folk song and to use the compositional principles of that genre to dictate the form of the music. It premiered on 15 March 1850. It became a touchstone for the following generation of Russian composers ranging from the Western-oriented Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to the group of nationalists known collectively as The Five and was also lauded abroad, most notably by French composer Hector Berlioz.

==Traditional &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot;==
According to musicologist Richard Taruskin, the traditional &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; is &quot;a quick dance tune&quot; otherwise known as a &quot;naigrish&quot;, distinctive for its three-bar phrase lengths, which are played in an endless number of variations in moto perpetuo fashion by an instrumentalist. This tune usually accompanies a squatting dance often called a &quot;Kazatsky&quot; (especially since in the West it has been associated in romantic fashion with Cossacks) and is played traditionally by a fiddler, a balalika player or a concertina player

==&quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; by Glinka==
Mikhail Glinka composed his &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; in 1848. It became famous as the first orchestral work based entirely on Russian folk song.

===Composition===
Glinka&#x27;s &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; is based on two themes, a slow bridal song, &quot;Iz-za gor&quot; (From beyond the mountains), and the title song, a &quot;naigrïsh&quot;. This second song is actually an instrumental dance played to an ostinato melody. This melody is repeated for as long as the dancers can move to it. Glinka begins with &quot;Iz-za gor,&quot; then introduces &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; as a contrasting theme. He uses a transition to return to the bridal song and show the contrast between the two themes. Another transition, this time using motifs from the bridal song, leads to the dance theme and the piece ends with the &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; dance. As in traditional &quot;nagriish&quot; songs, Glinka uses three-bar phrase lengths throughout the fast sections of his composition.
The structure and mechanics of &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; differ markedly from Western European compositional principles and in some ways are diametrically opposed to them. In a Western piece, after the first theme is introduced and harmony propels the music forward, it modulates to introduce a second theme in a contrasting musical key. The two themes then interact and the composition grows as an organic creation. Tension continues building as this thematic dialogue becomes increasingly complex. This dialogue or interchange eventually propels the piece to a climactic point of resolution. &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; does not follow this pattern. Nor can it. The ostinato melody of the second song will not allow any motivic development without distorting the character of the piece. Glinka therefore uses the principle of repetition from folk song to allowing the musical structure to unfold. He repeats the theme 75 times, all the while varying the background material—the instrumental timbres, harmonization and counterpoint. This way, he preserves the original character of the dance and complements it with creative variations in the orchestral treatment. However, because there is no thematic growth, the music remains static. It does not move forward as a Western piece of music would.

===Influence on Tchaikovsky===
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who had received Western-oriented musical instruction from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, had used folk songs in his student overture &quot;The Storm&quot;. However, in the early 1870s he became interested in using folk songs as valid symphonic material. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s greatest debt in this regard was to Glinka&#x27;s &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot;. He believed fervently that in &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; lay the core of the entire school of Russian symphonic music, &quot;just as the whole oak is in the acorn&quot;, as he would write in his diary in 1888.
Tchaikovsky&#x27;s interest resulted in his Second Symphony, composed in 1872. Because Tchaikovsky used three Ukrainian folk songs to great effect in this work, it was nicknamed the &quot;Little Russian&quot; (, &quot;Malorossiyskaya&quot;) by Nikolay Kashkin, a friend of the composer as well as a well-known musical critic of Moscow. Ukraine was at that time frequently called &quot;Little Russia&quot;. Successful upon its premiere, the symphony also won the favor of the group of nationalistic Russian composers known as The Five, led by Mily Balakirev. 

For Tchaikovsky, &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; offered a viable example of the creative possibilities of folk songs in a symphonic structure, using a variety of harmonic and contrapuntal combinations. It also offered a blueprint on how such a structure could be made to work, barring the potential for inertia or over-repetition. The development of the folk material, according to one biographer, is &quot;the most heady potion Tchaikovsky ever brewed&quot;. Without &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot;, however, Tchaikovsky knew he would not have had a foundation upon which to build that finale.

<text>Kurt Peter Eichhorn (4 August 1908 – 29 June 1994), was a German conductor.

Eichhorn was born in Munich, the son of a painter. He studied music at the conservatory in Würzburg with Hermann Zilcher and progressed through provincial houses. His conducting debut was in 1932 as a conductor and choral conductor in Bielefeld. He also worked as a conductor in Teplitz-Schönau and Karlsbad. Hitler&#x27;s annexation of the Sudetenland provided Eichhorn with career openings in Teplice (1939) and Karlovy Vary (1941–1943). He began conducting at the far more significant Dresden State Opera in 1941, and was a conductor of the Dresden Philharmonic in 1944.
The postwar years found him back in his hometown of Munich. From 1945, he directed the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra, the Bavarian People&#x27;s Opera, and taught conducting at the Munich Academy of Music. From 1956 to 1967, he was chief conductor of the State Theatre at the Gärtnerplatz in Munich. He was chief conductor of the Munich Radio Orchestra from 1967 to 1975. He was appointed honorary conductor of the Bruckner Orchestra in Linz, with which he began a recording cycle of the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, but this project remained unfinished when he died at Murnau. He was noted for his recordings of the music of Carl Orff. In 1991, the Bruckner Association of Upper Austria awarded him the Gold Plaque.

<doc id="374688" wikidata="Q756431" url="?curid=374688" title="Dime (United States coin)">
<text>The dime, in United States usage, is a ten-cent coin, one tenth of a United States dollar, labeled formally as &quot;one dime&quot;. The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792.

The dime is the smallest in diameter and is the thinnest of all U.S. coins currently minted for circulation, being in diameter and in thickness. The obverse of the current dime depicts the profile of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the reverse has an olive branch, a torch, and an oak branch, from left to right respectively.

The word &quot;dime&quot; comes from the Old French &quot;disme&quot; (Modern French dîme), meaning &quot;tithe&quot; or &quot;tenth part&quot;, from the Latin &quot;decima [pars]&quot;. The dime is currently the only United States coin in general circulation that is not denominated in terms of dollars or cents. , the dime cost 5.65 cents to produce.

==History==
The Coinage Act of 1792 established the dime (spelled &quot;disme&quot; in the legislation), cent, and mill as subdivisions of the dollar equal to , and dollar respectively.

The first known proposal for a decimal-based coinage system in the United States was made in 1783 by Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and David Rittenhouse. Hamilton, the nation&#x27;s first Secretary of the Treasury, recommended the issuance of six such coins in 1791, in a report to Congress. Among the six was a silver coin, &quot;which shall be, in weight and value, one-tenth part of a silver unit or dollar&quot;.

From 1796 to 1837, dimes were composed of 89.24% silver and 10.76% copper, the value of which required the coins to be physically very small to prevent their commodity value from being worth more than face value. Thus dimes are made small and thin. The silver percentage was increased to 90.0% with the introduction of the Seated Liberty dime; the use of a richer alloy was offset by reducing the diameter from 18.8 millimeters (0.740 inches) to its current figure of 17.9 millimeters (0.705 inches).

With the passage of the Coinage Act of 1965, the dime&#x27;s silver content was removed. Dimes from 1965 to the present are struck from a clad metal composed of outer layers of 75% copper and 25% nickel alloy, bonded to a pure copper core. Pre-1965 dimes followed Gresham&#x27;s law and vanished from ordinary currency circulation at face value. Most now trade as informal bullion coins known as junk silver, priced at some multiple of face value, which price follows the spot price of silver on commodity markets.

Starting in 1992, the U.S. Mint began issuing Silver Proof Sets annually, which contain dimes composed of the pre-1965 standard of 90% silver and 10% copper, then switched to .999 fine silver from 2019 onward. These sets are intended solely for collectors and are not meant for general circulation.

==Design history==
Since its introduction in 1796, the dime has been issued in six different major types, excluding the 1792 &quot;disme&quot;. The name for each type (except for the Barber dime) indicates the design on the coin&#x27;s obverse.

*Draped Bust 1796–1807
*Capped Bust 1809–1837
*Seated Liberty 1837–1891
*Barber 1892–1916
*Winged Liberty Head (Mercury) 1916–1945
*Roosevelt 1946–present

===&quot;Disme&quot; (1792)===
The Coinage Act of 1792, passed on April 2, 1792, authorized the mintage of a &quot;disme&quot;, one-tenth the silver weight and value of a dollar. The composition of the disme was set at 89.24% silver and 10.76% copper. In 1792, a limited number of dismes were minted but never circulated. Some of these were struck in copper, indicating that the 1792 dismes were in fact pattern coins. The first dimes minted for circulation did not appear until 1796, due to a lack of demand for the coin and production problems at the United States Mint.

===Draped Bust (1796–1807)===
The first dime to be circulated was the Draped Bust dime, in 1796. It featured the same obverse and reverse as all other circulating coins of the time, the so-called Draped Bust/Small Eagle design. This design was the work of then-Chief Engraver Robert Scot. The portrait of Liberty on the obverse was based on a Gilbert Stuart drawing of prominent Philadelphia socialite Ann Willing Bingham, wife of noted American statesman William Bingham. The reverse design is of a small bald eagle surrounded by palm and olive branches, and perched on a cloud. Since the Coinage Act of 1792 required only that the cent and half cent display their denomination, Draped Bust dimes were minted with no indication of their value.

All 1796 dimes have 15 stars on the obverse, representing the number of U.S. states then in the Union. The first 1797 dimes were minted with 16 stars, reflecting Tennessee&#x27;s admission as the 16th state. Realizing that the practice of adding one star per state could quickly clutter the coin&#x27;s design, U.S. Mint Director Elias Boudinot ordered a design alteration, to feature just 13 stars (for the original Thirteen Colonies). Therefore, 1797 dimes can be found with either 13 or 16 stars.

Also designed by Robert Scot, the Heraldic Eagle reverse design made its debut in 1798. The obverse continued from the previous series, but the eagle on the reverse was changed from the widely criticized &quot;scrawny&quot; hatchling to a scaled-down version of the Great Seal of the United States. The Draped Bust/Heraldic Eagles series continued through 1807 (although no dimes dated 1799 or 1806 were minted). Both Draped Bust designs were composed of 89.24% silver and 10.76% copper.

===Capped Bust (1809–1837)===
The Draped Bust design was succeeded by the Capped Bust, designed by Mint Assistant Engraver John Reich. Both the obverse and reverse were changed extensively. The new reverse featured a bald eagle grasping three arrows (symbolizing strength) and an olive branch (symbolizing peace). Covering the eagle&#x27;s breast is a U.S. shield with six horizontal lines and 13 vertical stripes. Also on the reverse is the lettering &quot;10C,&quot; making it the only dime minted with the value given in cents (subsequent issues are inscribed with the words &quot;ONE DIME&quot;). The lack of numeric value markings on subsequent dime coins causes some confusion amongst foreign visitors, who may be unaware of the value of the coin. Also, the Capped Bust dime was the first dime to have its value written on the coin. Previous designs of the dime had no indication of its value, the way people determined its value was by its size 

Capped Bust dimes minted through 1828 are known as the Large type. This is partially because they were struck without a restraining collar, which gave them a broader appearance. In 1828, Chief Engraver William Kneass introduced the close collar method of coining (which automated the process of placing reeds on a coin&#x27;s edge). In addition to standardizing the diameter of coins, the new method allowed the Mint to produce thicker coins. To maintain a standard weight and alloy, the diameter of most coins was reduced. In particular, the dime was reduced in diameter from 18.8 to 18.5 millimeters. This new Capped Bust dime, which began production in 1828, is known as the Small type. There are 123 varieties known of Capped Bust Dimes.

===Seated Liberty (1837–1891)===
Christian Gobrecht completed the design of the Seated Liberty dime, whose obverse was used with every circulating silver U.S. coin of the period. Mint Director Robert Maskell Patterson requested a new coin design, to be reminiscent of the Britannia image found on coinage of the United Kingdom. Chief Engraver William Kneass drew the original sketches, but suffered a stroke and was too ill to finish them or to oversee preparation of the dies. The task then fell to Gobrecht, who was promoted to Second Engraver.

The obverse features an image of Liberty sitting on a rock, wearing a dress and holding a staff with a liberty cap on top. Her right hand is balancing a shield with the inscription &quot;LIBERTY.&quot; The reverse featured the inscription &quot;ONE DIME,&quot; surrounded by a wreath. All Seated Liberty dimes contain 90% silver and 10% copper, and are 17.9 millimeters (0.705 inch) in diameter. This size and metal composition would continue until 1965, when silver was permanently removed from circulating dimes.

There were several minor varieties during the Seated Liberty&#x27;s run. The initial design (1837) had no stars on the obverse and, further, the dates were minted in a Large Date and Small Date variety. These two types can be distinguished by noting the &quot;3&quot; and the &quot;7&quot; in the date. In the Large Date variety, the &quot;3&quot; has a pointed serif at top, and the horizontal element of the &quot;7&quot; is straight. In the Small Date variety, the &quot;3&quot; has a rounded serif, and there is small a knob, or bulge, in the &quot;7&quot; horizontal element. Only the Philadelphia Mint made both varieties. The Small Date is slightly rarer. The New Orleans Mint also made the Seated Liberty Dime in this year, but only in the Small Date variety.

Thirteen stars (symbolizing the 13 original colonies) were added to the perimeter of the obverse in 1838. These were replaced with the legend &quot;United States of America,&quot; which was moved from the reverse in mid-1860. At the same time, the laurel wreath on the reverse was changed to a wreath of corn, wheat, maple, and oak leaves and expanded nearly to the rim of the coin. This reverse design continued through the end of the series in 1891 and was changed only slightly in 1892, when the Barber dime debuted. Another variety is the 1838–40 dime minted with no drapery underneath the left elbow of Liberty.
Arrows at the date in 1853 and 1873 indicated changes made in the coin&#x27;s mass (from 2.67 grams to 2.49 grams in 1853, then to 2.50 grams in 1873). The first change was made in response to rising silver prices, while the latter alteration was brought about by the Mint Act of 1873 which, in an attempt to make U.S. coinage the currency of the world, added a small amount of mass to the dime, quarter, and half-dollar to bring their weights in line with fractions of the French 5-franc piece. The change also ensured the quarter dollar (which is valued 2.5 times the dime) weighed 2.5 times the dime (6.25g), and the half dollar (twice the value of the quarter dollar) weighed twice what the quarter dollar weighed (12.5g). In this way, a specific weight of these coins, no matter the mixture of denominations, would always be worth the same. This relation in weight and value continued in the cupronickel coins from 1965 on.

This produced the greatest rarities in the Seated Dime Series, the 1873 and 1874 Carson City Dimes, with arrows and the unique 1873 Carson City Dime without arrows.

===Barber (1892–1916)===
The Barber dime is named for its designer, Charles E. Barber, who was Chief Engraver of the U.S. Mint from 1879 to 1917. The design was shared with the quarter and half-dollar of the same period. Extensive internal politics surrounded the awarding of the design job, which had initially been opened to the public. A four-member committee (which included Barber), appointed by then-Mint Director James Kimball, accorded only two of more than 300 submissions an honorable mention. Kimball&#x27;s successor, Edward O. Leech, decided to dispense with the committees and public design competitions and simply instructed Barber to develop a new design. It has been speculated that this is what Barber had wanted all along.

The Barber dime, as with all previous dimes, featured an image of Liberty on the obverse. She is wearing a Phrygian cap, a laurel wreath with a ribbon, and a headband with the inscription &quot;LIBERTY&quot;. This inscription is one of the key elements used in determining the condition of Barber dimes. Liberty&#x27;s portrait was inspired by two sources—French coins and medals of the period, as well as ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. The obverse also contains the long-used 13 stars (for the 13 colonies) design element. The reverse contained a wreath and inscription almost identical to the one used on the final design of the Seated Liberty dime. Dimes were produced at all four of the mints that operated during the period. While circulated coins of the entire series are readily available to collectors there is one outstanding rarity, the 1894-S Barber Dime. Twenty-four were minted, with 9 currently known.

===Winged Liberty Head (&quot;Mercury&quot;) (1916–1945)===

Although most commonly referred to as the &quot;Mercury&quot; dime, the Winged Liberty Head does not depict the Roman messenger god. The obverse figure is a depiction of the mythological goddess Liberty wearing a Phrygian cap, a classic Western symbol of liberty and freedom, with its wings intended to symbolize freedom of thought. Designed by noted sculptor Adolph A. Weinman, the Winged Liberty Head dime is considered by many to be one of the most beautiful U.S. coin designs ever produced. The composition (90% silver, 10% copper) and diameter (17.9 millimeters) of the &quot;Mercury&quot; dime was unchanged from the Barber dime.

Weinman (who had studied under Augustus Saint-Gaudens) won a 1915 competition against two other artists for the design job, and is thought to have modeled his version of Liberty on Elsie Kachel Stevens, wife of noted poet Wallace Stevens. The reverse design, a fasces juxtaposed with an olive branch, was intended to symbolize America&#x27;s readiness for war, combined with its desire for peace. Although the fasces was later officially adopted by Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party, the symbol was also common in American iconography and has generally avoided any stigma associated with its usage in wartime Italy.

===Franklin D. Roosevelt (1946–present)===

Soon after the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in April 1945, legislation was introduced by Virginia Congressman Ralph H. Daughton that called for the replacement of the Mercury dime with one bearing Roosevelt&#x27;s image. The dime was chosen to honor Roosevelt partly due to his efforts in the founding of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (later renamed the March of Dimes), which originally raised money for polio research and to aid victims of the disease and their families.

Due to the limited amount of time available to design the new coin, the Roosevelt dime was the first regular-issue U.S. coin designed by a Mint employee in more than 40 years. Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock was chosen, as he had already designed a Mint presidential medal of Roosevelt. Sinnock&#x27;s first design, submitted on October 12, 1945, was rejected, but a subsequent one was accepted on January 6, 1946. The dime was released to the public on January 30, 1946, which would have been Roosevelt&#x27;s 64th birthday. Sinnock&#x27;s design placed his initials (&quot;JS&quot;) at the base of Roosevelt&#x27;s neck, on the coin&#x27;s obverse. His reverse design elements of a torch, olive branch, and oak branch symbolized, respectively, liberty, peace, and strength.

Controversy immediately ensued, as strong anti-Communist sentiment in the United States led to the circulation of rumors that the &quot;JS&quot; engraved on the coin was the initials of Joseph Stalin, placed there by a Soviet agent in the mint. The Mint quickly issued a statement denying this, confirming that the initials were indeed Sinnock&#x27;s. The same rumor arose after the release of the Sinnock designed Franklin half dollar in 1948.
Another controversy surrounding Sinnock&#x27;s design involves his image of Roosevelt. Soon after the coin&#x27;s release, it was claimed that Sinnock borrowed his design of Roosevelt from a bas relief created by African American sculptor Selma Burke, unveiled at the Recorder of Deeds Building in Washington, D.C. in September 1945. Sinnock denied this and stated that he simply utilized his earlier design on the Roosevelt medal.

With the passage of the Coinage Act of 1965, the composition of the dime changed from 90% silver and 10% copper to a clad &quot;sandwich&quot; of pure copper inner layer between two outer layers of cupronickel (75% copper, 25% nickel) alloy giving a total composition of 91.67% Cu and 8.33% Ni. This composition was selected because it gave similar mass (now 2.268 grams instead of 2.5 grams) and electrical properties (important in vending machines)—and most importantly, because it contained no precious metal.

The Roosevelt dime has been minted every year, beginning in 1946. Through 1955, all three mints, Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco produced circulating coinage; production at San Francisco ended in 1955, resuming in 1968 with proof coinage only. Through 1964 &quot;D&quot; and &quot;S&quot; mintmarks can be found to the left of the torch. From 1968, the mintmarks have appeared above the date. None were used in 1965–67, and Philadelphia did not show a mintmark until 1980 (in 1982, an error left the &quot;P&quot; off a small number of dimes, which are now valuable). To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the design, the 1996 mint sets included a &quot;W&quot; mintmarked dime made at the West Point Mint. A total of 1,457,000 dimes were issued in the sets, making it the lowest mintage Roosevelt dime up to that time. Since then, the &quot;P&quot; mint mark 2015 reverse proof dime and &quot;W&quot; mint mark 2015 proof dime, minted at Philadelphia and West Point for inclusion in the March of Dimes collector set, have the lowest mintages with 75,000 pieces struck for each.

<doc id="374689" wikidata="Q1779508" url="?curid=374689" title="Settle, North Yorkshire">
<text>Settle is a market town and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England. Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the town had a population of 2,421 in the 2001 census, increasing to 2,564 at the 2011 census.

==History==
Settle is thought to have 7th-century Anglian origins, its name being the Angle word for settlement. Craven in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; shows that until 1066 Bo was the lord of Settle but after the Harrying of the North (1069–1071) the land was granted to Roger de Poitou.

In 1250, a market charter was granted to Henry de Percy, 7th feudal baron of Topcliffe by Henry III. A market square developed and the main route through the medieval town was aligned on an east–west direction, from Albert Hill, Victoria Street, High Street and Cheapside and on through Kirkgate. This road led to Giggleswick where the citizens attended the parish church. The first bridge over the River Ribble was mentioned in 1498.

During the English Civil War, the Cliffords, the lords of the manor were Royalists, but their subjects were not. John Lambert of Calton in Malhamdale, was a general in Cromwell&#x27;s army and his troops camped at Settle in August 1651 while on the road to an encounter in Lancaster.

==Infrastructure==

Daniel Defoe wrote &quot;Settle is the capital of an isolated little kingdom of its own surrounded by barren hills.&quot; Because of its remoteness Settle saw mostly local commerce. The old roads were pack horse trails and drovers&#x27; roads along hilltops because the valley was soft and swampy before field drainage and the dredging of stream estuaries.

In the 1700s, textile industrialists supported by traders and landowners campaigned for a turnpike to connect with growing industrial towns. The minute book for the Keighley and Kendal Turnpike Trust shows that most investors were mill owners from the Giggleswick district. In 1827, the trust, having miscalculated the cost of road maintenance, was in debt by £34,000. When in 1877 the trust was terminated, the investors received on average 54% of their deposit. The investors benefited because Settle was now well connected and its cotton mills boomed. The mill owners imported coal and, like the heavy industries that exported agricultural lime and sandstone masonry, welcomed the turnpike for access via carrier waggons to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Gargrave. The first passenger stagecoach arrived in 1763. The Mail Coach was running regularly in 1786. The Union coach for passengers ran each way on alternate days in the early 1800s and daily by 1840.

The &quot;little&quot; North Western Railway reached in 1847 and, in 1849, the railway company constructed Station Road from Giggleswick to Settle. In 1875, the Settle to Carlisle Railway was built and opened to goods traffic; passenger services commenced the following year when Settle railway station opened along with a goods warehouse, cattle pens, signal box and water cranes.

In the late 18th century, cotton spinning became the town&#x27;s main employment. Bridge End Mill was converted from corn milling to cotton spinning. John Procter operated mills at Runley and King&#x27;s Mill which were taken over by his son Thomas. He built the row of workers&#x27; cottages, Procter&#x27;s Row in Lower Kirkgate. In 1835, Dog Kennel Mill and Brennand&#x27;s Weaving Shed, Settle had five mills employing 333 people.

==Governance==
Settle is part of the parliamentary constituency of Skipton and Ripon, represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2010 by Julian Smith MP, a Conservative.

Before 1 April 2023, Settle was in the Settle and Ribblebank ward of Craven District Council and the Ribblesdale division of North Yorkshire County Council. Following local government reorganisation, it is now in the Settle &amp; Penyghent division of the new North Yorkshire Council unitary authority. The division is represented by 1 Conservative Councillor.

Settle is served by a town council made up of 10 councillors. The mayor is elected annually and the current Town Mayor is Councillor Debi Rymer. The Deputy Mayor is Councillor Stephen Hogg.

Since 1992, the town has been twinned with the French Mediterranean seaside town of Banyuls-sur-Mer.

==Geography==

Settle was part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. It is located in Ribblesdale, at the southern edge of the Yorkshire Dales, within a few miles of the Three Peaks. Immediately overlooking the town is Castlebergh, a limestone crag, and to the east is Malham which was in the former Settle Rural District. The River Ribble provided power for Settle&#x27;s former cotton mills; it is now being harnessed by Settle Hydro, a micro hydroelectric scheme, to provide 50 kW of power to the National Grid, which was opened in 2009.

==Transport==

Settle railway station is situated on the Settle to Carlisle line. It is served by Northern Trains, who operate services between Leeds and Carlisle. Giggleswick railway station is sited away from Settle and is on the Bentham line between Leeds and Morecambe.

Bus routes are operated by Kirkby Lonsdale Coaches and North Yorkshire Council, which link the town with Giggleswick, Horton in Ribblesdale, Kirkby Lonsdale, Skipton and Wigglesworth.

The town is located from Leeds Bradford Airport.

The main road through Settle is the B6480, which links to the A65; it connects the town with Leeds, Ilkley, Skipton and Kendal.

==Local media==
Since the town is closest to the Lancashire and North Yorkshire border, local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and Granada Television that broadcast from Salford. Local radio stations are BBC Radio York on 104.3 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire on 107.8 FM, and Dales Radio on 104.9 FM. The town&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;Craven Herald &amp; Pioneer&quot;.

==Tourism==
Settle&#x27;s market is held weekly on Tuesdays in the town-centre marketplace and in the Victoria Hall, a short distance away on Kirkgate. Settle Town Hall was sold by Craven District Council to a developer in October 2011. The Square is surrounded by local businesses, most of which are family-owned, with some offering items for sale unique to the Settle area. The Naked Man is believed to be the oldest cafe in the country.

The Yorkshire Festival of Story brings artists to the town and has a range of paid-for and free events suitable for all age ranges. The festival attracts visitors from around the world and audiences have more than trebled in size since the first festival in 2010. The event is the largest of its kind in the North of England. The Yorkshire Festival of Story is produced by Settle Stories an arts and heritage charity based in the town. Since 2014 the Flowerpot Festival has brightened the town&#x27;s streets.

The Folly is a 17th-century Grade I listed building on the main street. In 1996, the North Craven Building Preservation Trust purchased part of the Folly, restored it and opened it to the public in 2001. The Folly houses the Museum of North Craven Life and hosts exhibitions during the open season. There are permanent displays, including the Settle to Carlisle Railway, Robert (Mouseman) Thompson furniture and local history. The rest of the building has been purchased by the trust. The museum is independent and run by volunteers.

The Gallery on the Green is thought to be the smallest art gallery in the world: drawings, paintings, photographs and other works are housed in a former BT telephone kiosk. Gavagan Arts at Linton Court Gallery is situated in a courtyard off Duke Street. The gallery presents a series of temporary exhibitions of modern and contemporary art.

The Listening Gallery is an audio gallery in an old phone box. The gallery has changing exhibitions and is open 365 days a year and is free to enter. The box is maintained and was created by Settle Stories.

The district has several caves where prehistoric remains have been found, the most notable being Victoria Cave, so-called because the inner chamber was discovered in 1837 on the day of Queen Victoria&#x27;s accession. The cave is a geological SSSI and scheduled monument. Victoria Cave contained fossil remains. The earliest, at 130,000 years old, include mammoth, straight-tusked elephant, cave bear and hippopotamus, &quot;Bos primigenius&quot;, &quot;Rhinoceros leptorhinus&quot; and spotted hyenas (as a bed of hyena bones). They date to an Upper Pleistocene interglacial. After the last Ice Age the cave was used by hibernating brown bear and reindeer. Associated with the later deposits were a harpoon head carved from antler; flint implements and other ornaments. The discovery of flint is noteworthy as it is not found naturally in the area. Craven Museum &amp; Gallery in Skipton has an exhibition of items which includes a bear&#x27;s skull found in one of the caves.

==Cultural==
The composer Edward Elgar visited Settle on many occasions to visit his friend Dr Charles William Buck. There is a blue plaque at Cravendale to commemorate this.

==Education==
Settle has two schools, with Settle Primary School and Settle College. Settle Middle School closed as part of the money-saving measures taken by North Yorkshire County Council.
To the west of the town is Giggleswick School, one of the principal private schools in the North of England, founded in 1512.

<doc id="374693" wikidata="Q931754" url="?curid=374693" title="Face value">
<text>The face value, sometimes called nominal value, is the value of a coin, bond, stamp or paper money as printed on the coin, stamp or bill itself by the issuing authority.

The face value of coins, stamps, or bill is usually its legal value. However, their market value need not bear any relationship to the face value. For example, some rare coins or stamps may be traded at prices considerably above their face value. Coins may also have a salvage value due to more or less valuable metals that they contain.

==Overview==
The face value of bonds usually represents the principal or redemption value. Interest payments are expressed as a percentage of face value. Before maturity, the actual value of a bond may be greater or less than face value, depending on the interest rate payable and the perceived risk of default. As bonds approach maturity, actual value approaches face value.

In the case of stock certificates, face value is the par value of the stock. In the case of common stock, par value is largely symbolic. In the case of preferred stock, dividends may be expressed as a percentage of par value.

The face value of a life insurance policy is the death benefit. In the case of so-called &quot;double indemnity&quot; life insurance policies, the beneficiary receives double the face value in case of accidental death.

The face value of property, casualty or health insurance policies is the maximum amount payable, as stated on the policy&#x27;s face or declarations page.

Face value can be used to refer to the apparent value of something other than a financial instrument, such as a concept or plan. In this context, &quot;face value&quot; refers to the apparent merits of the idea, before the concept or plan has been tested.

Face value also refers to the price printed on a ticket to a sporting event, concert, or other event (the price the ticket was originally sold for by the organization hosting the event). The practice of re-selling tickets for more than face value (or a certain amount above face value) is commonly known as ticket scalping.

&quot;Taking someone at face value&quot; is assuming another person&#x27;s suggestion, offer, or proposal is sincere, rather than a bargaining ploy.

<text>The Implementation Force (IFOR) was a NATO-led multinational peace enforcement force in Bosnia and Herzegovina under a one-year mandate from 20 December 1995 to 20 December 1996 under the codename &quot;Operation Joint Endeavour&quot;.

==Background==

In 1995, NATO was tasked by the United Nations (UN) to carry out the provision of the Dayton Peace Accords ending the Bosnian War. The Dayton Peace Accords were started on 22 November 1995 by the presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia, on behalf of Serbia and the Bosnian Serb Republic. The actual signing happened in Paris on 14 December 1995. The peace accords contained a General Framework Agreement and eleven supporting annexes with maps. The accords had three major goals: ending of hostilities, authorization of military and civilian program going into effect, and the establishment of a central Bosnian government while excluding individuals who are serving sentences or under indictment by the International War Crimes Tribunals from taking part in the running of the government. IFOR&#x27;s specific role was to implement the military Annexes of &quot;The General Framework Agreement for Peace (GFAP) in Bosnia and Herzegovina&quot;.

IFOR relieved the UN peacekeeping force UNPROFOR, which had originally arrived in 1992, and the transfer of authority was discussed in Security Council Resolution 1031. Almost 60,000 NATO soldiers in addition to forces from non-NATO nations were deployed to Bosnia. Operation Decisive Endeavor (SACEUR OPLAN 40105), beginning 6 December 1995, was a subcomponent of Joint Endeavor. IFOR began operations on 20 December 1995.

The Dayton Agreement resulted from a long series of events, notably, the failures of EU-led peace plans, the August 1995 Croat Operation Storm and fleeing of 200,000 Serb civilians, the Bosnian Serb war crimes, in particular the Srebrenica massacre, and the seizure of UNPROFOR peace-keepers as human shields against NATO&#x27;s Operation Deliberate Force.

U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry and his Russian counterpart, Pavel Grachev agreed on 8 October that the peacekeeping operation name will be Implementation Force of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is without reference to NATO; other differences were unresolved at that time (chain of command, area of command and control). On 27 October they agreed that &quot;the Russian unit will not be part of the NATO peacekeeping force, but will perform special engineering, transport and construction &quot;.

Admiral Leighton W. Smith Jr., Commander in Chief Allied Forces Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH), served as the first Joint Force Commander for the operation, also known as Commander IFOR (COMIFOR). He commanded the operation from IFOR&#x27;s deployment on 20 December 1995 from headquarters in Zagreb, and later from March 1996 from the Residency in Sarajevo. Admiral Thomas J. Lopez commanded the operation from 31 July to 7 November 1996, followed by General William W. Crouch until 20 December 1996. Lt Gen Michael Walker, Commander Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), acted as Land Component Commander for the operation, commanding from HQ ARRC (Forward) based initially in Kiseljak, and from late January 1996 from HQ ARRC (Main) in Ilidža. This was NATO&#x27;s first ever out-of-area land deployment. The Land Component&#x27;s part of the operation was known as Operation Firm Endeavour.

At its height, IFOR involved troops from 32 countries and numbered some 54,000 soldiers in-country (BiH) and around 80,000 involved soldiers in total (with support and reserve troops stationed in Croatia, Hungary, Germany, and Italy and also on ships in the Adriatic Sea). In the initial phases of the operation, much of the initial composition of IFOR consisted of units which had been part of UNPROFOR but remained in place and simply replaced their United Nations insignia with IFOR insignia.

==Components==

NATO member states that contributed forces included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Non-NATO nations that contributed forces included; Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden, Russia, and Ukraine.

The tasks of the Land Component were carried out by three Multi National Divisions:

On 20 December 1996, the task of IFOR was taken over by SFOR. In turn, SFOR was replaced by the European EUFOR Althea force in 2004.

NATO began to create service medals once it began to support peacekeeping in the former Yugoslavia, which led to the award to IFOR troops of the NATO Medal.

<text>Weston Park Museum is a museum in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. It is one mile west of Sheffield city centre within Weston Park. It is Sheffield&#x27;s largest museum and is housed in a Grade II* listed building and managed by Museums Sheffield. Until 2006 it was called Sheffield City Museum and Mappin Art Gallery.

==History==
The museum opened in 1875 in Weston House, whose grounds later became the park. A neoclassical extension, in the Ionic order, was added in 1887. The Mappin Art Gallery was built to house the collection of work bequeathed to the city by the Rotherham businessman John Newton Mappin. Weston Hall was demolished in the 1930s and a purpose-built structure, adjoining the Mappin Art Gallery, and funded in part by donations from local businessman J. G. Graves, was completed in 1937.

For much of its history the complex was officially known as the Sheffield City Museum and Mappin Art Gallery. The museum contained Sheffield&#x27;s archaeology, natural history, decorative art and social history collections. The Mappin Art Gallery held Mappin&#x27;s own collection and temporary art exhibitions. In December 1940 the Mappin Art Gallery suffered a direct hit in the Sheffield Blitz, destroying a significant part of the building and damaging much of the rest. During the 1950s and 1960s the museum remained open to the public, whilst the Mappin Art Gallery was left in a partially demolished state after the structure had been made safe. The Mappin Art Gallery reopened in 1965. From 1965 to 2003 it hosted significant art exhibitions, such as the British Art Show, and celebrated its centenary in 1987. 

The two buildings closed in March 2003 for complete renovation. The £17.3 million re-development was partly funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Sheffield City Council and Objective 1 for South Yorkshire. The building reopened in October 2006 as Weston Park Museum. This removed the separate identity of the Mappin Art Gallery. The museum closed again in summer 2016 for a refurbishment and to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the renovation.

The museum&#x27;s archaeology exhibits include a replica of the Bronze Age rock art from Gardom&#x27;s Edge and many items collected by Thomas Bateman, notably the Benty Grange helmet which closely matches the descriptions of warriors&#x27; helmets in Beowulf. There are seven galleries: the Harold Cantor Gallery; Sheffield Life and Times; History Lab; Arctic World; What On Earth!; Treasures; and Picturing Sheffield. The Harold Cantor Gallery houses temporary exhibitions, which include major touring exhibitions from national partners such as the V&amp;A and British Museum.

The museum is home to one of the longest serving weather stations in the country, providing data on Sheffield&#x27;s weather since 1882.

Weston Park museum receives around 250,000 visitors a year and was nominated for the prestigious Gulbenkian Prize in 2007. In 2008 the museum won &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; Family Friendly Museums award.
