<text>The Piano Quintet in G minor, Op. 57, is a five-movement composition for two violins, viola, cello, and piano by Dmitri Shostakovich. He composed it between July 13 and September 14, 1940. Sources conflict on where he began to compose it—the location is variously stated to be Shalovo, Kellomäki, or Moscow—but most agree that it was completed in Leningrad. It is the second of Shostakovich&#x27;s two attempts at composing a piano quintet. His first dated from his student years, but was ultimately abandoned and repurposed in other compositions.

A suggestion from the Beethoven Quartet over dinner in 1938 led to the creation of the Piano Quintet. Originally, Shostakovich had conceived the work as a string quartet. However, according to Isaak Glikman, an arts critic and close friend, Shostakovich modified the instrumentation because he hoped that demand for his performances as pianist would result in increased opportunities for personal travel. According to the musicologist Richard Taruskin, Shostakovich modeled his Piano Quintet, including its key and use of Baroque musical forms, on Sergei Taneyev&#x27;s. Over the years, a number of small alterations to the score were made, which are documented in the two recordings of the work that Shostakovich made with the Beethoven Quartet in 1940 and 1955.

The Piano Quintet&#x27;s official premiere on November 23, 1940, at the Small Hall of the Moscow Conservatory was an immediate public success. Encores at this and subsequent concerts became so commonplace, that it quickly became a source of jokes for wags who referred to the work as a five-movement work with seven movements. Occasionally, audiences demanded encores of the entire work. Performances of the Piano Quintet took up so much of Shostakovich&#x27;s time between late 1940 and mid-1941 that he had only enough time to compose a single work during that period.

Opinions were more mixed among Shostakovich&#x27;s professional colleagues. Sergei Prokofiev and Alexander Goldenweiser both were ambivalent about the music&#x27;s merits, while the musicologist Daniel Zhitomirsky defended the work against detractors who had simplistic expectations from Soviet music. Even before the Piano Quintet&#x27;s official premiere, it had been nominated for the inaugural Stalin Prize, along with works by Prokofiev, Nikolai Myaskovsky, and Aram Khachaturian. After three rounds of voting by the prize committee—as well as an unsuccessful last-minute personal appeal to Joseph Stalin from a disgruntled CPSU member who sought to deny the work a prize—the March 16, 1941 issue of &quot;Pravda&quot; announced that the Piano Quintet won in the first-class category. Its monetary award of 100,000 rubles attracted significant commentary from music critics in the United States after the work&#x27;s stateside premiere in Carnegie Hall on April 29, 1941.

==Background==
===First attempt at a quintet===
Shostakovich first attempted to compose a piano quintet during his student years. This earlier quintet was conceived in the early 1920s; by April 9, 1923, he completed its first movement and designated the work &quot;op. 7&quot;. A subsequent movement, subtitled &quot;Fantastic Scherzo&quot;, was also planned, but the idea of a piano quintet was soon abandoned. Instead, he developed the &quot;Fantastic Scherzo&quot; into the Scherzo for piano and orchestra, which kept the projected quintet&#x27;s op. 7 assignation, while the remaining music was repurposed in the Piano Trio No. 1.

He also composed music for piano with string quartet in his score to the 1936 film, &quot;Girlfriends&quot;.

===Partnership with the Beethoven Quartet===
One of the most enduring professional and personal relationships Shostakovich had was that between him and the Beethoven Quartet. Of the composer&#x27;s fifteen string quartets, the Beethoven Quartet premiered all but the first and last. Aside from the Piano Quintet, their members also participated in the premiere of the Piano Trio No. 2. Karina Balasanyan, a Russian musicologist, said that the closeness of their partnership, rare in music history, led the Beethoven Quartet to become &quot;emissaries of [Shostakovich&#x27;s] will&quot;.

On December 26, 1933, during their tenth season in existence, the Beethoven Quartet programmed music by Shostakovich for the first time: a joint performance with the Glière Quartet of the Two Pieces for String Octet. It was not until 1938, however, when they played the Moscow premiere of Shostakovich&#x27;s String Quartet No. 1 that his music became a permanent part of their repertory.

===Origins and composition===

During a celebratory dinner in Moscow on November 16, 1938, that followed the local premiere of the String Quartet No. 1, the Beethoven Quartet suggested to Shostakovich the idea of composing a piano quintet. A few months later in 1939, Shostakovich replied in the affirmative to the Beethoven Quartet&#x27;s first violinist, : &quot;I will certainly write a quintet and I will play it with you&quot;. Isaak Glikman, an arts critic and close friend of Shostakovich, related that the Piano Quintet had originally been planned as a string quartet, but that external considerations influenced the composer to alter the instrumentation:

His explanation of the change [in instrumentation] was idiosyncratic, to say the least. According to him, his change of heart had not been dominated by artistic considerations at all, but purely practical concerns. &quot;Do you want to know why I wrote a piano part into the quartet? I did it so that I could play it myself and have a reason to go on tour to different towns and places. So now ... the Beethoven Quartet, who get to go everywhere, will have to take me with them, and I will get my chance to see the world as well!&quot; We both laughed. &quot;You are not serious?&quot;, I said. Shostakovich replied: &quot;Absolutely! You are a dyed-in-the-wool stay-at-home, but I am a dyed-in-the-wool wanderer!&quot;

Shostakovich&#x27;s official biographer, Sofia Khentova, said that Shostakovich was also moved to compose the Piano Quintet out of his desire to enrich the field of chamber music with elements of symphonic music.

Enthusiasm for the Piano Quintet notwithstanding, Shostakovich did not find the time to begin work on it until July 1940. He wrote to , the Beethoven Quartet&#x27;s second violinist, that he started work on his new composition on July 13. In a subsequent letter to Shirinsky dated August 6, Shostakovich reiterated that he was looking forward to playing the work with the Beethoven Quartet soon, even though he had never played as part of a quintet before.

Sources agree on the timeframe of the composition, but not location. Gerard McBurney, Laurel Fay, Marina Raku, and Vera Zaitseva state that the Piano Quintet was begun in Shalovo (today part of the town of Luga) and completed in Leningrad. Derek C. Hulme cited Moscow as the location of composition. Khentova said that in July 1940, Shostakovich traveled from Gaspra in Crimea, where he completed his orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, to vacation in the village of Kellomäki (present-day Komarovo). There, he rented a two-story cottage and settled in to work. With few residents and visitors, Shostakovich was able to compose the Piano Quintet in secluded surroundings without disturbances. He completed the score on September 14, 1940, in Leningrad and a copy for performance and publication was immediately prepared.

Shostakovich introduced the Beethoven Quartet to the Piano Quintet on September 17. He invited them, as well as the pianists Lev Oborin and Konstantin Igumnov, to listen to his playthrough of the work on the piano.

Preparations for the Piano Quintet&#x27;s official premiere began on October 22 at a practice room in the Moscow Conservatory. Tsyganov recalled Shostakovich&#x27;s method of collaborative rehearsal: &quot;First, he played his new piece on the piano from the score; then he distributed the various parts to us, always requesting strongly that we not begin rehearsing without him&quot;. Rehearsals typically began late at night, usually around 11:00 p.m., and lasted until the following morning.

==Music==
===Structure===

The Piano Quintet consists of five movements:

The musicologist Michael Mishra said that the structure of the Piano Quintet, with a pair of connected movements pivoting around a central scherzo, superficially resembled that of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 5, although he noted that Shostakovich did not imitate its distribution of weight. Richard Taruskin, another musicologist, posited that Shostakovich clearly invoked the Piano Quintet of another Russian composer, Sergei Taneyev. He listed as evidence the fact that both quartets reference Baroque musical forms and share the same key. &quot;Taneyev was the very model of an academic composer&quot;, he said, &quot;and in emulating him via his Piano Quintet, Shostakovich was characterizing himself the same way, which as we know by now signaled a big change of direction&quot;. Each movement, according to Khentova, develops internal emotions within an overall symphonic structure.

A typical performance of the Piano Quintet lasts approximately 29 minutes.

===Description===

Shostakovich&#x27;s Piano Quintet opens with a &quot;Prelude&quot;: a construction in ternary form that fuses neo-Baroque and Romantic elements. The choice of title was not invoked out of convenience, but as a token of the composer&#x27;s deep engagement with Baroque music. Mishra described the movement as &quot;essentially a prolongation of the G tonic&quot;. He also likened the movement&#x27;s close to a &quot;grand cadential &#x27;spinning out&#x27; of the sort frequently found at the end of a Bach prelude&quot;.

This is succeeded without pause by the &quot;Fugue&quot;, the first of four that Shostakovich composed in the 1940s. Khentova characterized it as &quot;philosophical&quot;, while Fay wrote that its &quot;polyphonic mastery [was] worthy of Bach&quot;. A rising three-note figure that appeared in the closing measures of the &quot;Prelude&quot; resurges in the second measure of the &quot;Fugue&quot;, making both movements an integrated unit that anticipates the 24 Preludes and Fugues. Both movements also forecast inflections that Shostakovich would later use in his Jewish-inspired works, such as the Piano Trio No. 2. As the movement builds to a climax, Shostakovich abandons the fugal form in favor of homophonic textures that make a more immediate emotive impact. Recitatives for piano, then cello follow suit, before the fugue resumes in stretto. Mishra wrote of the &quot;Fugue&quot;:

The form of this movement may be somewhat unusual, but it does serve a clear expressive goal—setting the inexorable momentum, texture, and procedures into a larger psychological profile that, with its central climax and gradual withering away, is less typically &quot;fugal&quot; and more akin to a Shostakovich symphonic slow movement (that of the Fifth Symphony, for example).

The &quot;Scherzo&quot;, which has been described as a &quot;fast ländler&quot; and whose tempo establishes a loose relation to equivalent movements in the String Quartet No. 1 and Sixth Symphony, is the center of the Piano Quintet. Rhythms associated with Spanish dances, which feature regularly in Shostakovich&#x27;s music, are incorporated into the trio.

Evocations of Baroque music return in the &quot;Intermezzo&quot;, which at first gives the impression of a passacaglia before diverging from the procedures used in that musical form. Nevertheless, the music makes allusions to Henry Purcell, the &quot;Air&quot; from Bach&#x27;s Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D major, and Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Holberg Suite&quot;; the latter itself an homage to musical forms from the past.

Contrasting sharply with the preceding movements is the lighter tone of the &quot;Finale&quot;. Mishra said that although its coda does not strive for the transcendence that typifies the work as a whole, the &quot;Finale&quot; can be heard as the first of a type of ending movement that Shostakovich would explore in his later works, &quot;where predominantly lightweight material becomes sublimated in the coda to achieve an enigmatic, but highly poignant sense of resignation&quot;. Ian MacDonald, on the other hand, noted that emotionally and structurally the &quot;Finale&quot; was &quot;as disjunctive as that of the Sixth Symphony&quot;.

===Later amendments===

A number of small alterations were made to the score of the Piano Quintet in the years immediately following its premiere. Valentin Berlinsky recalled that he and his fellow Borodin Quartet members were admonished by Shostakovich for slowing down through a particular passage in the &quot;Prelude&quot; during a 1947 rehearsal of the Piano Quintet. When they protested that a ritenuto was indicated in that passage, he walked up to them, brandished a pen, and crossed out the marking from each one of their parts.

The Borodin Quartet was also the instigator of a more significant modification, this time in the &quot;Finale&quot;. Whether it was the result of an accident or direct suggestion is disputed, but it resulted in a portion of music which originally had the viola and cello playing in unison changed to an imitative dialogue.

Tempi were also modified between the original manuscript and the 1956 published edition, possibly to suit Shostakovich&#x27;s own pianism, which inclined to very fast tempi, an aspect repeatedly criticized by his chamber music partners. According to a member of the Glazunov Quartet, Shostakovich &quot;accentuated the constructive, motor elements [of the Piano Quintet], and achieved his effect through clarity and the flow of the music&quot;. These differences in tempi are documented in both of Shostakovich&#x27;s commercial recordings of the Piano Quintet. As Tsyganov observed:

Shostakovich was an unsurpassed performer of his own solo and chamber work, playing them, as a composer of genius, in his own unique way—his approach then became the ideal for all performers. It was impossible to differentiate his compositions from his interpretations, as was also the case for those of Medtner, Rachmaninoff, and Prokofiev.

Overall, the 1940 recording is often slower than the metronome markings indicated in the score; the musicologist Sofia Moshevich called it a &quot;raw and still imperfect interpretive sketch&quot;. Shostakovich evinced a desire to press the tempo in a number of places, but was held back by the &quot;safe&quot; pace set by the Beethoven Quartet. By contrast, the fleet tempi of the 1955 recording, which Moshevich describes as &quot;polished and refined&quot;, were subsequently incorporated into the 1956 published score.

===Manuscripts===
A preliminary sketch piano score of the first three movements and fair manuscript of the entire Piano Quintet survive. Sketches for the last two movements, however, are presumed lost. The extant sketches consist of four sheets of slightly yellowed music paper that bear the title &quot;Rough Draft of the Quintet&quot; and notations in purple ink. Tempi and ordinal numberings are only accorded therein to the &quot;Fugue&quot;. Dating for the sketches of what would become the &quot;Prelude&quot; suggest that the movement was composed in a single day on July 16, 1940. A fragment for an early version of the &quot;Scherzo&quot; is crossed out in black and red pencil.

The fair copy of the Piano Quintet is notated with black ink on 38 sheets of 14-staff music paper that is slightly yellowed. A few errors are crossed out; there are also further markings in pencil and red and green inks. The score is stored in the archives of the .

==Premieres==
On November 23, 1940, the Piano Quintet&#x27;s official premiere occurred at the Small Hall of the Moscow Conservatory; the performers were the Beethoven Quartet, with Shostakovich at the piano. Their performance was part of a ten-day festival of Soviet music.

Preceding that concert was an informal premiere in Leningrad on October 1 at the Leningrad branch of the Union of Soviet Composers. On that occasion, Shostakovich was joined by the Glazunov Quartet, the ensemble that had premiered his String Quartet No. 1. Another performance with the Beethoven Quartet and Shostakovich followed on November 12, that time in Moscow for the Stalin Prize committee.

The American premiere of the Piano Quintet, played by the Stuyvesant Quartet with pianist Vivian Rifkin, took place at Carnegie Hall in New York City on April 29, 1941. It was part of an all-Russian program sponsored by the American Russian Institute that also included performances by Vytautas Bacevičius, Andor Földes, Benny Goodman, and Paul Robeson.

===First recordings===
On December 10, 1940, between 1:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m., the Beethoven Quartet and Shostakovich recorded the Piano Quintet at the in Moscow. Their recording, made on magnetic film, was intended solely for radio broadcast. It was not available commercially until it was issued on CD in 1993 by the Czech label Multisonic.

The first commercial recording of the Piano Quintet was a set of four 78 RPM discs made by the Stuyvesant Quartet and Vivian Rifkin for Columbia Records that was issued in February 1942.

==Publication==
Muzgiz published the first edition of the score in 1941, a photocopy of which was published by the Am-Rus Music Corporation for sale in North America. Subsequent editions were published by Edition Peters, Hans Sikorski Musikverlage, Muzyka, and DSCH Publishers.

==Reception==
===In the Soviet Union===

Tsyganov later said that the premiere &quot;without exaggeration was a triumph&quot;; the audience demanded encores of the last three movements. David Rabinovich, who wrote a biography on Shostakovich that was approved by the composer, was among the audience at the Piano Quintet&#x27;s official premiere in 1940:

One cannot forget the atmosphere that reigned in the [Small Hall] of the Moscow Conservatory during the premiere of the Quintet. It came at the end of a concert after three new quartets by three leading Soviet composers had been played. The audience was growing tired. But when the Beethoven Quartet, so well-known to Moscow music-lovers, appeared on the stage with Shostakovich himself, and when the first strains of the Quintet resounded, all workaday, dearly-beloved, and accustomed sensations disappeared without leaving a trace. Obviously something important was happening in the hall, something that was outside the scope of &quot;current&quot; musical events.

After the concert, Shostakovich, who was &quot;very pale, very excited&quot;, visited his friend Marietta Shaginyan. &quot;I have been so shaken by the success of the Quintet that I could not go home immediately after the concert&quot;, she recorded him saying in her diary. &quot;Instead, I have been wandering the streets of Moscow—my soul filled with bliss&quot;.

Critics and audiences alike received the Piano Quintet enthusiastically; demand for performances from all over the Soviet Union was intense. Tickets for performances sold out before posters advertising the events could be set up. Audiences at the work&#x27;s early performances often requested individual movements as encores; occasionally, they insisted that the entire work be repeated. Encores of the &quot;Scherzo&quot; and &quot;Finale&quot; were so commonplace that wags referred to the work as &quot;a piece in five movements of which there are seven&quot;. Performances of the Piano Quintet occupied Shostakovich to the extent that in the period from its premiere until mid-1941, he was able to compose only a single work.

Within the Soviet musical establishment, occasional suspicion and hostility to Shostakovich&#x27;s Piano Quintet mingled with general approval. One of the composers who publicly stated their ambivalent feelings was Sergei Prokofiev, whose remarks were published in the February 1941 issue of &quot;Sovyetskaya Muzyka&quot;. He commented favorably on the work&#x27;s architectural clarity and balancing of instrumental voices. Of all the movements, Prokofiev held the &quot;Fugue&quot; as the &quot;best and most interesting&quot; in the Piano Quintet. &quot;One has to hand it to Shostakovich: in his fugue, as far as the general impression it makes, there is an unusual amount that&#x27;s new&quot;, he said. &quot;I don&#x27;t even know whether it&#x27;s a good fugue from the technical standpoint. But musically it&#x27;s good&quot;. Prokofiev interspersed his compliments with objections against the Piano Quintet&#x27;s length, accusations that Shostakovich trafficked in clichéd mannerisms and sounded geriatric in spite of his youth, and insinuations that the work&#x27;s rapturous reception with Soviet audiences betrayed their unsophistication. He concluded that the Piano Quintet was &quot;a remarkable composition&quot;, but in the same closing sentence added that it &quot;lacked momentum and climaxes&quot;.

A contrasting article by the musicologist Daniel Zhitomirsky was published in the same issue of &quot;Sovyetskaya Muzyka&quot;. Acknowledging that the Piano Quintet &quot;aroused in certain musicians a spirit of opposition toward Shostakovich&quot;, he criticized the work&#x27;s detractors for their simplistic expectations of Soviet music. He also addressed misgivings he heard from some of his colleagues concerning the work&#x27;s &quot;great and authentic feelings&quot; being filtered &quot;through a prism of thought&quot;:

This type of art may of course provide the highest aesthetic enjoyment, but not always with blazing immediacy, nor will it be attainable at all levels of musical discernment. This last [point] is very important. Sometimes we tend to equate the idea of what is democratic (or belonging to the people) in art with what is immediately comprehensible. But from that standpoint many of the greatest achievements of human culture will seem antidemocratic, for far from all of them, even in our country, the most democratic in the world, are truly accessible (in the sense of being capable of complete inner assimilation) by a wide audience. Do we need this intellectual type of art? Of course we do: it is needed and deeply to be valued, as a particular artistic genre, alongside other genres, neither replacing them nor contradicting them.

Maximilian Steinberg, Shostakovich&#x27;s former composition teacher, noted in his diary that the Piano Quintet was &quot;an outstanding work of the Soviet chamber music literature&quot; which throughout displayed &quot;wonderful mastery&quot;.

===Stalin Prize===
====Deliberations====
After the Piano Quintet was first played for the Stalin Prize committee by the Beethoven Quartet and Shostakovich on November 12, 1940, another performance for members of the Union of Soviet Composers occurred on November 19. At the time, Shostakovich had not yet been as favored by the Soviet government as he would become after the 1942 premiere of his Symphony No. 7. Moreover, the committee was disinclined to place Shostakovich above older and established contenders. Consequently, in early deliberations the Piano Quintet was ranked below another prize nominee, the Symphony No. 21 by Nikolai Myaskovsky. Other first-round contenders included the Violin Concerto by Aram Khachaturian and the opera &quot;Semyon Kotko&quot; by Prokofiev.

Members of the music section of the prize committee included Myaskovsky, Alexander Goldenweiser, Yuri Shaporin, Isaak Dunayevsky, Samuil Samosud, and ; the latter chairman of the Committee on Arts Affairs. Leading the panel was Reinhold Glière. Goldenweiser tempered his cautious praise of Shostakovich with criticism of the &quot;Scherzo&quot; and &quot;Finale&quot;. He specifically drew attention to &quot;deliberately grotesque passages&quot; in the former that he negatively likened to the composer&#x27;s earlier work prior to his 1936 censure. Another committee member, the painter Igor Grabar, refuted his colleague&#x27;s criticisms:

When I was listening to Shostakovich&#x27;s Quintet, I had the feeling that I was not among contemporary composers, but among the great masters. I was completely shaken—no, I was crushed. I had the feeling that I was back in Mozart&#x27;s time... This work is stamped with the seal of genius. How could we not give it a prize! At the dawn of my life, I was lucky enough to have known Tchaikovsky ... and at my life&#x27;s sunset, I live in the time of Shostakovich.

On the morning of November 25, a brief article by published in &quot;Pravda&quot; praised the Piano Quintet as the &quot;best work of 1940&quot;. Because of Shaverdyan&#x27;s position as editor of &quot;Sovyetskoye Iskusstvo&quot;, his endorsement was interpreted by readers as representing the official opinion of the Committee on Arts Affairs and its chairman, Khrapchenko. Concerned that the article was intended to influence the results of the prize committee&#x27;s first round of voting, which were scheduled to take place later that same day, Goldenweiser immediately contacted the editorial board of &quot;Pravda&quot; with his disapproval. Shostakovich&#x27;s Piano Quintet lost to Myaskovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 21 by a single vote in the first round of voting. Reticence towards Shostakovich from the music section contrasted with the strong support he received from non-musicians in the prize committee.

Developments that transpired in other Stalin Prize categories at the end of 1940 resulted in the Politburo approving an expansion of the music section&#x27;s prizes from one to five and permission for the prize committee to consider awards for works composed as far back as 1935. Ultimately, the music sections&#x27;s allotment of prizes was increased to eight: three for first prize and five for second. The new rules not only permitted the retention of Shostakovich and Myaskovsky on the short list of nominees, but momentarily led to the consideration of the former&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 instead of the Piano Quintet. This idea was quickly discarded because the committee believed that the later work better exemplified Shostakovich&#x27;s musical reformation since 1936. Shostakovich and Myaskovsky tied in the second round of voting held on January 4, 1941.

====Dissent====
A conjectural threat to the Piano Quintet&#x27;s fortunes came in the form of a letter addressed to Joseph Stalin, dated January 7, 1941. Its author, Moisei Grinberg, was a pianist and CPSU member born in Rostov-on-Don. Formerly the head of the State Committee on Music Institutions and editor-in-chief of Muzgiz, he was deposed from both positions during the Great Purges. He was thereafter allowed to remain a member of the CPSU, but in lower level employment. In 1941, he was the deputy artistic director of the Stanislavsky Opera Theatre and a junior editor at &quot;Sovyetskaya Muzyka&quot;. Therefore, according to the musicologist Marina Frolova-Walker, Grinberg &quot;was no random malcontent&quot;: his letter was an attempt at personal rehabilitation and ingratiation with the authorities.

Grinberg protested to Stalin that &quot;certain unhealthy tendencies&quot; were emerging in Soviet music. One of the targets of his complaints was Shostakovich&#x27;s Piano Quintet:

...So much of [it] is contrived and there are so many abstract formal quests and so little of genuine beauty and strength ... [It] may stand out for its formal perfection, but this form is nourished by rationalism and the air of the hothouse, rather than by any living human energy. This is music that lacks any connection with the life of the People.

Rather than commending the neoclassicism that had made the work widely liked, Grinberg contented that this trait was proof of its &quot;deeply Western orientation&quot;. No personal malice towards Shostakovich was intended, Grinberg said; he suggested that the Stalin Prize should go to his Symphony No. 5 instead. Professional nepotism and privileged seclusion from the general musical audience, Grinberg additionally suggested, resulted in the prize committee&#x27;s unsatisfactory choices of candidates. He closed his letter with a plea for Stalin&#x27;s personal supervision of Soviet music.

Extant evidence indicates that Grinberg&#x27;s letter never reached Stalin, who likely never heard Shostakovich&#x27;s Piano Quintet and customarily remained aloof from matters pertaining to music.

====Award====
The Piano Quintet was awarded a Stalin Prize, first class in the third and final round of voting; the results were publicly announced in &quot;Pravda&quot; on March 16, 1941. First class prizes were worth 100,000 rubles. Average monthly salaries for manual workers and heads of university departments at the time were 300 and 1,500 rubles respectively.

===In the United States===
American journalists in the wake of the stateside premiere of the Piano Quintet frequently commented on the monetary award the work earned with its Stalin Prize; the &quot;Pittsburgh Sun Telegraph&quot; called it &quot;the most expensive piece of chamber music ever composed&quot;. In 1941, Howard Taubman of the &quot;New York Times&quot; estimated that the Stalin Prize money was worth . &quot;There are few, if any, compositions in history that have brought their composer as much at one swoop&quot;, he said in his review of the American premiere, before expressing skepticism of the work&#x27;s monetary worth. Taubman, nevertheless, commended the music, which he said was stylistically similar to Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 5, as &quot;engaging&quot; and &quot;strong&quot;. He named the recording of the Piano Quintet made by the Stuyvesant Quartet and Rifkin as one of the best albums of 1942.

<doc id="377207" wikidata="Q2618974" url="?curid=377207" title="Nǁng language">
<text>Nǁng () or Nǁŋǃke, commonly known by the name of its only spoken dialect Nǀuu (), is a moribund Tuu language once spoken in South Africa. It is no longer spoken on a daily basis, as the speakers live in different villages. The ǀʼAuni name for the Nǀuu, ǂKhomani, is used by the South African government. As of June 2021, only one speaker of the Nǀuu dialect remains, the rest of the population having shifted to Khoekhoe and Afrikaans.

==Classification and name==
Nǁng belongs to the Tuu (Taa–ǃKwi) language family, with extinct ǂUngkue being its closest relative and Taa its closest living relative.

The two recent dialects are a western/northwestern one, to which Nǀuu (Nǀhuki) is sometimes restricted, and a nameless eastern dialect from the area of Langeberg. As of 2010, most remaining speakers spoke Nǀuu dialect, and this was the name Nǁng appeared under when it was rediscovered. However, two spoke the eastern dialect and rejected the label Nǀuu.

The easiest of the various names for English speakers to pronounce is &quot;Nǀuu&quot;. The letter that looks like a vertical bar (sometimes substituted with a slash) represents a dental click like the English interjection &quot;tsk! tsk! (tut! tut!)&quot; used to express pity or shame, but nasalized; &quot;Nǀuu&quot; is pronounced like &quot;noo&quot;, with a &quot;tsk!&quot; in the middle of the . The double-vertical-bar in &quot;Nǁng&quot; is a (single) lateral click, pronounced like the &quot;tchick!&quot; used to spur on a horse; the name is pronounced like the &quot;ng&quot; of &quot;sung&quot; with this click in it.

The word &quot;nǀuu&quot; is actually a verb, &#x27;to speak a Bushman language&#x27;, possibly from Khoekhoe. &quot;Nǀhuki&quot; is a deverbal, &#x27;a Bushman language&#x27;. The people call themselves &quot;Nǁŋ-ǂe&quot; &#x27;Nǁng people&#x27;, and Westphal believes this may be the term recorded by Bleek and variously rendered in the literature as &quot;ǁNg ǃʼe, ǁn-ǃke, ǁŋ.ǃke&quot;.

The name &quot;Nǀusan&quot; is an ambiguous Khoekhoe exonym, and is used for several Tuu languages. Traill says that the ǀʼAuni call their language &quot;Nǀhuki,&quot; but others have recorded their name for their language as &quot;ǀʼAuo,&quot; and both Westphal and Köhler state that &quot;Nǀhuki (Nǀhuci, nǀɦuki)&quot; is a variety of Nǁng. It is possible the languages have gotten mixed up in the literature.

==Doculects==

Güldemann (2017) lists the following pre-democracy doculects as being Nǁng. 

== History ==
Nǁng prospered through the 19th century, but encroaching non-ǃKwi languages and acculturation threatened it, like most other Khoisan languages. The language was mainly displaced by Afrikaans and Nama, especially after speakers started migrating to towns in the 1930s and found themselves surrounded by non-Nǁng-speaking people. In 1973 their language was declared extinct, and the remaining Nǁnǂe (&quot;ǂKhomani&quot;) were evicted from the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park.

In the 1990s, linguists located 101-year-old Elsie Vaalbooi, who could still speak Nǁng. Anthony Traill interviewed her in 1997. The South African San Institute soon became involved in the pursuit of information on the Nǁng language, and with the help of Vaalbooi they tracked down 25 other people scattered by the eviction who were able to speak or at least understand the language. Thabo Mbeki handed over 400 km2 of land to the Nǁnǂe in 1999, and 250 km2 of land within the park in 2002. Vaalbooi came up with the Nǁng motto of &quot;Sa ǁʼa ǃainsi uinsi&quot; &quot;We move towards a better life&quot; for her rehabilitated people. This was also adopted as the official motto for the Northern Cape Province. At the time there were twenty elderly speakers, eight of whom lived in the Western Cape province signed over to them. As of 2007, fewer than ten were still alive in South Africa, and a few more in Botswana; none live with another speaker, and their daily languages are Khoekhoe and Tswana, respectively. 
In 2013 there were three speakers in the Upington area and two in Olifantshoek (ǁʼAu), speaking the western and eastern dialects, respectively. The younger generations of ǂKhomani are proud Nama speakers and have little affinity to Nǁng.

Recent research on Nǁng led by Amanda Miller of Cornell University has helped describe the physics of its clicks, leading to a better understanding of click sounds in general.

Efforts to perpetuate the Nǁng language continued in 2017 and in 2021. The first Nǁng children&#x27;s book, !Qhoi n|a Tjhoi (Tortoise and Ostrich), was written by Katrina Esau, one of the two surviving speakers at the time, in May 2021. In June 2021, her brother Simon Sauls died, leaving 88-year-old Katrina Esau as the last speaker of the language. Esau had opened a school with her granddaughter to teach the language to children, but it was vandalized during the COVID pandemic and abandoned. In October 2022, the Dutch NOS referred to Esau, or &quot;Oma Katrina&quot;, as the last speaker of Nǀuu. She was teaching the language to a group of children, including her grandson and great-grandson, all speakers of Afrikaans.

==Phonology==
Nǁng has one of the more complex sound inventories of the world&#x27;s languages. Most lexical words consist of a phonological foot with two moras (tone-bearing units). The first mora must start with a consonant (CV). The second mora may be a single vowel (V), a nasal consonant &quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot; (N), or one of a drastically reduced number of consonants plus a vowel (cV). That is, lexical roots, not counting sometimes lexicalized CV prefixes and suffixes, are typically CVcV, CVV, CVN, though there are also a few which are CV, as well as longer words of two phonological feet: CVCV, where the second C is not one of the reduced set of consonants but cannot be a click, CVCVN, CVVCV, CVNCV, CVVCVN, CVNCVN, CVcVCV, CVVCVcV. Grammatical words tend to be CV or V.

There are occasional exceptions to these patterns in ideophonic words such as &#x27;Namaqua sandgrouse&#x27; (CVcVCVCVV + suffix) and historically reduplicated words with clicks such as &#x27;to talk&#x27;.

===Vowels===
Like most languages in southern Africa, Nǁng has five vowel qualities. These may occur strident and nasalized. A word may have two adjacent vowels, which resemble a long vowel or diphthong.

The strident vowels are thought to have the phonation called harsh voice. They are strongly pharyngealized, and for some speakers involve low-frequency trilling that presumably involves the aryepiglottic fold. The four strident vowel qualities (there is no strident &quot;i&quot;) are rather different from the non-strident vowels, as is common when a vowel is pharyngealized.

Nǁng is the only Khoisan language known to have a strident front vowel, , though this is rare, occurring in only two known words, zeqe &#x27;to fly&#x27; and ǂʻheqbe &#x27;man&#x27;s loincloth&#x27;. The lack of a nasalized equivalent is thought to be an accidental gap or simply unattested due to the small number of known words.

The tone-bearing segment may be a syllabic nasal, , rather than a vowel, as in the name Nǁng.

Only certain sequences of vowels may occur in a bimoraic foot, regardless of whether there is an intervening consonant. (That is, the permitted vowels are the same whether a word is CVcV or CVV.) If the first vowel is any variety (nasal, strident, etc.) of , then the second vowel must be identical. If the first vowel is , then the second may be anything but . If the first vowel is or , then the second may be either or a vowel of the same height: that is, &quot;oa, oo, oe; ua, uu, ui&quot;. The vowels must be both oral or both nasal; nasal vowels cannot follow a nasal stop (though they may follow nasal clicks). Only the first vowel may be strident.

Front vowels can only follow the click types and (the back-vowel constraint), with a single known exception, &#x27;to go&#x27;. Front vowels and strident vowels may also not follow , whether an affricate release or a fricative, with the exception of three female kin terms where the second syllable is . As with the lack of strident front vowels, there are thus a small number of exceptions for these constraints with , but none with .

===Tones===
Nǁng moras may carry a high or low tone, /H/ or /L/. A typical lexical word consists of two moras, and so may have a high (HH), low (LL), rising (LH), or falling (HL) tone.

Monomoraic lexical roots, such as &#x27;mouth&#x27;, are high- rather than low-tone by a 5–1 margin. CVV and CVN roots are HH, HL, and LH with about equal frequency, with LL slightly less common. However, half of all CVcV roots are LH, making it markedly frequent, while only 5% are HL. In an additional CV foot the distribution of H and L is approximately equal; an additional CVN or CVcV foot may pattern like an initial foot, but they are too infrequent to be sure.

===Consonants===
The majority of Nǁng consonants are clicks. It was once thought that Khoisan languages distinguish velar and uvular clicks, but recent research into Nǁng, and reevaluation of the data on ǃXóõ, indicates that, for these languages at least, the distinction is one of pure clicks versus click–plosive contours.
&quot;(?)&quot; marks possible accidental gaps; these consonants might be expected based on their occurrence in neighboring languages with similar phonologies, but are expected to be rare, and may occur in Nǁng words that have not been recorded.

What were historically initial alveolar occlusives have become pre-palatal in lexical words. Among grammatical words in the western dialect there is a single exception, &quot;ná&quot; &#x27;I&#x27;; in the eastern dialect even that has merged, for &quot;ɲá&quot; &#x27;I&#x27;.
Only sonorants may occur as the medial consonant of a phonological foot. is only known from three words. The oral sonorants do not occur in initial position.

These are simple clicks. The traditional term &quot;velaric&quot; is something of a misnomer, for the rear articulation is further back than the velum, and indeed further back than Nǁng . Miller et al. prefer the term &quot;lingual&quot; for this airstream mechanism; they also reject the existence of click &quot;accompaniments&quot;, using the IPA symbols to represent both points of articulation rather than solely the anterior articulation. Besides being motivated phonetically, this has the benefit of better illustrating the parallels between clicks and pulmonic consonants.

In the above rubric, the first element of the name is the forward articulation, and the second is the rear articulation.

These are airstream contour consonants, which start off with a lingual (velaric) airstream mechanism and finish with a pulmonic airstream (whereas affricates are manner contour consonants, starting as plosives and finishing as fricatives). Traditionally, these were considered to be uvular clicks, because the uvular or pharyngeal closure is audible, but in fact the rear closure of all Nǁng clicks is uvular or pharyngeal. (The distinction between uvular and pharyngeal is not represented here.) Effectively, in these clicks the release of the rear articulation is delayed, so that there is a double release burst, the forward (lingual) release followed by the rear (pulmonic) release.

These differ from the previous consonants in that the second, rear release is an ejective.

<text>Baqubah (; BGN: Ba‘qūbah; also spelled Baquba and Baqouba) is the capital of Iraq&#x27;s Diyala Governorate. The city is located some to the northeast of Baghdad, on the Diyala River. In 2003 it had an estimated population of some 280,000 people.
Baqubah served as a way station between Baghdad and Khorasan on the medieval Khorasan Road. During the Abbasid Caliphate, it was known for its date and fruit orchards, irrigated by the Nahrawan Canal. It is now known as the centre of Iraq&#x27;s commercial orange groves.

==History==
Baqubah&#x27;s name originates from the Aramaic words &quot;Bet&quot; (house) and &quot;aquba&quot; (Guardian or Punishment) meaning &quot;The house of Punishment/The Guardian&#x27;s house&quot;. The city was used as a refugee camp for Assyrian refugees fleeing the Assyrian genocide. A refugee camp was set up outside the city, which accommodated between 40,000 and 50,000 refugees.

The camp set up by the British mandate government in Iraq housed Assyrians and Armenians following the 1915 Sayfo and Armenian genocide by the Ottoman Empire. The camp was ruled by military authority and the later Assyrians living in the camp were recruited to serve in the Iraq Levies Forces.

===Medieval history===
Baqubah was probably founded during the Sasanian period.

At the time of the Abbasid caliphate, Baqubah lay on the Nahrawan canal, at the end of the canal&#x27;s Great Qātūl stage and the beginning of its Tāmarrā stage. Although the main road heading east to Khorasan from Baghdad bypassed Baqubah during this period, passing instead through the city of Jisr Nahrawan, it was Baqubah and not Jisr Nahrawan that was the capital of the Upper Nahrawan district.

However, the succeeding Seljuk sultans neglected to dredge the Nahrawan canal or otherwise maintain it, and by the time of Yaqut al-Hamawi in the early 1200s, the canal had completely silted up and the lands it had once watered had gone out of cultivation. By the 14th century, Hamdallah Mustawfi wrote that Jisr Nahrawan was in ruins, and the road to Khorasan now passed through Baqubah instead. Baqubah was the main town in the &quot;Tarīq-i-Khurāsān&quot; district, and it was surrounded by fertile orchards that produced large crops of oranges and pomelos.

In Yaqut&#x27;s time, Baqubah was a flourishing town, with several public baths and mosques, as well as a market. The land around Baqubah was densely covered in irrigated orchards, whose dates and lemons were proverbial for their excellence.

===Modern history===
In the early 1800s, Baqubah was surrounded by date palm groves, as well as orchards producing lemons, pomegranates, and other fruits. In 1820, Baqubah is described as being home to 2,000 people, of whom almost half were Shi&#x27;ite. It had a bazaar and two small mosques.

In the early 1820s, though, the Kurdish army of Mohammad Ali Mirza, governor of Kermanshah, occupied Baqubah and destroyed much of it. A decade later, it was still in ruins. By 1845, the bazaar and one of the mosques were functioning again, and local agriculture was flourishing. By the early 1870s, the Ottoman civil administration had managed to restore stability to the region, and Baqubah became increasingly prosperous. Around the turn of the century, one European traveler described its connections to emerging networks of world commerce:

===Recent history===
During the course of the US-led occupation of Iraq, Baquba emerged as the scene of some of the heaviest guerrilla activity, along with the Sunni enclaves of Fallujah and Ramadi. It was the site of the heaviest fighting during the June 24, 2004, insurgent offensive. Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad, led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, took responsibility for the attacks.

In a setback for insurgents, Iraqi and U.S. officials confirmed on June 7, 2006, that Zarqawi had been killed in an airstrike and subsequent raid north of Baquba. During late 2006, however, Baqubah and majority of Diyala Governorate were reported to have come under Sunni insurgent control. On January 3, 2007 the previous Iraqi government in Baquba was reported to have fallen, leaving the city in the hands of insurgents fighting against the American led coalition in Operation Iraqi Freedom. During this time, the city was reportedly under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq.

In January 2007, it was reported that Sunni insurgents were able to kidnap the mayor and blow up his office, despite promises from American and Iraqi military officials that the situation in the city was &quot;reassuring and under control&quot;. The city at its peak had over 460,000 residents, but a February 2007 report labeled the city a &quot;ghost town&quot; as residents either fled criminal and sectarian violence or remained in hiding at home.

On August 10, 2015 a suicide car bombing near Baqubah killed 30 and wounded 40 people. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.

===Operation Arrowhead Ripper===
On June 19, 2007, U.S. forces launched a large-scale operation against Sunni militants in Baquba. The offensive, Operation Arrowhead Ripper, involved approximately 10,000 coalition soldiers.

===Lingering legacy of Ba&#x27;ath Party and Saddam Hussein===
Along with the city of Fallujah, Baqubah has kept the names of monuments and mosques named after some of the most controversial officers and campaigns of the Baath Party. For example, still today, a large mosque named after Adnan Khairallah is found in the city. There is also an Izzat Ibrahim mosque in Baqubah (and another one in its satellite town of Buhriz), named likewise after a high officer of Saddam Hussein. Furthermore, Baqubah also hosts a mosque named the Anfal mosque, which echoes the name of the Anfal Campaign, which involved the mass killing of the Kurds under the supervision of Adnan Khairallah. These, like other Baath Party-related names, are controversial among Iraqi Shia and Kurds who lost so many lives to the abuses of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, Saddam Hussein and military/security figures like Adnan Khayrullah, Ali Hassan al-Majid and Izzat Ibrahim.

==Climate==

<text>&quot;For the municipality in Quebec, see Adstock, Quebec&quot;
Adstock is a village and civil parish about northwest of Winslow and southeast of Buckingham in the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire. The 2001 Census recorded a parish population of 415 reducing to 363 at the 2011 Census.

There are remains of a Roman road in the village.

In the divisions of England that took place between AD 613 and 1017, Buckinghamshire was divided into eight hundreds. The manor of Adstock originally formed part of the Votesdune Hundred, then merged into the Ashendon Hundred and was finally absorbed into the Buckingham Hundred. At that time it was surrounded by the Bernwood, one of the most important Royal Forests. At the end of the 10th century, Adstock formed a portion of the Lands of Godwine, Earl of Kent and his second wife Gytha Thorkelsdóttir.

After the Norman conquest of England, its name was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Edestoche&quot; which is Old English and means &quot;Eadda&#x27;s Farm&quot;. Nearby Addington was named after the same person.

In the mid to late 11th century the manor of Adstock was given by William the Conqueror to his illegitimate son William Peverel, who was listed as its owner in 1086. This suggests that the manor was of some value, or that its previous owner was of some prominence in Anglo Saxon society.

The village received a charter to establish itself as a town briefly in 1665 so that a market could be held there. This was due to the majority of the people from the two local towns of Winslow and Buckingham being infected with bubonic plague. The charter was removed, however, in 1685 and Adstock was reinstated as a village rather than a town.

The parish church, which dates from the 12th century, is dedicated to St Cecilia. The roof is dated 1597, and the church underwent further major restoration during the Victorian era. There are two bells (the lightest of which dates back from about 1440) in the church and one Sanctus

Adstock had an outstation from the Bletchley Park codebreaking establishment, where some of the Bombes used to decode German Enigma messages in World War Two were located.

<text>WEWS-TV (channel 5) is a television station in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, affiliated with ABC. It has been owned by the E. W. Scripps Company since its inception in 1946, making it one of three stations that have been built and signed on by Scripps (alongside company flagship WCPO-TV in Cincinnati and WMC-TV in Memphis, the latter of which was sold in 1993). WEWS-TV&#x27;s studios are located on Euclid Avenue (near I-90) in Downtown Cleveland, and its transmitter is located in suburban Parma.

==History==

The station first signed on the air on December 17, 1947, as the first television station in Ohio, and the 16th overall in the United States. The call letters denote the initials of the parent company&#x27;s founder, Edward Willis Scripps. The station is the oldest in Cleveland to maintain the same channel position (as an analog broadcaster), ownership and call letters since its sign-on. A few weeks before WEWS-TV&#x27;s sign-on, Scripps launched WEWS-FM 102.1 (later occupied by WDOK) as an outlet for WEWS-TV personalities to gain on-air experience before the launch of the television station. Channel 5&#x27;s first broadcast was of a Christmas pageant run by the station&#x27;s corporate cousin, &quot;The Cleveland Press&quot;. Its staff included capable producers Jim Breslin and Betty Cope, who would later become president of WVIZ (channel 25).

WEWS originally operated as a CBS affiliate, with secondary ABC and DuMont affiliations; it shared the secondary ABC affiliation with WXEL-TV (now WJW-TV, channel 8). WEWS lost the CBS affiliation to WJW-TV in 1955 after that station&#x27;s then-owner, Storer Broadcasting, used its influence with CBS to land the affiliation; ABC then became channel 5&#x27;s primary network. The station later lost the DuMont affiliation when that network ceased operations in 1956. WEWS was also an affiliate of the short-lived Paramount Television Network; the station was one of the network&#x27;s strongest affiliates, airing such Paramount programs as &quot;Time For Beany&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Reel&quot;, and &quot;Frosty Frolics&quot;. WEWS also aired two NBC programs, both of which had been preempted by Westinghouse-owned NBC affiliate KYW-TV (now WKYC): the network&#x27;s evening newscast &quot;The Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot;, during the 1959–1960 season; and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, with hosts Jack Paar and later Johnny Carson, from October 1957 to February 1966.

In 1977, WEWS-TV went before the U.S. Supreme Court for recording and broadcasting the entire human cannonball act of Hugo Zacchini. He performed his circus routine at the Geauga County Fair in Burton, Ohio, and the station did not compensate him, as was required by Ohio law. In &quot;Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment did not shield WEWS from liability from common law copyright claims.

On May 23, 1994, as part of an overall deal in which network parent News Corporation also purchased a 20% equity interest in the group, New World Communications signed a long-term affiliation agreement with Fox to switch thirteen television stations that New World owned or was acquiring from a Big Three network, including WJW-TV, to Fox. The deal was motivated by the National Football League (NFL)&#x27;s awarding of the rights to the National Football Conference (NFC) television package to Fox on December 18, 1993, in which the conference&#x27;s broadcast television rights moved to the network effective with the 1994 NFL season, ending a 38-year relationship with CBS. As Fox was seen at the time on lower-profile UHF station WOIO (channel 19), CBS immediately targeted WEWS, as well as sister station WXYZ-TV in Detroit as its new affiliates in those markets. On June 16, however, Scripps signed a long-term deal with ABC that would keep WEWS-TV and WXYZ-TV as affiliates of the network; Scripps also agreed to affiliate WMAR-TV in Baltimore, KNXV-TV in Phoenix, and WFTS-TV in Tampa with ABC in the deal.

===Dual network affiliates===

From 1955 until December 31, 1996, WEWS held a distinction of being one of two primary ABC affiliates for the Cleveland market. WAKR-TV (channel 49) began operations on June 7, 1953, as a primary ABC affiliate, two years prior to WEWS joining the network. WAKR-TV&#x27;s ties to ABC dated back to when radio adjunct WAKR signed on in 1940 as an NBC Blue/Blue Network affiliate and were incentivized by ABC&#x27;s merger with United Paramount Theaters. For the network&#x27;s part, they were engaged in a push to sign up as many affiliates as possible to compensate for NBC, CBS and Dumont having stronger affiliate bases.

WAKR-TV&#x27;s launch was delayed for several years: originally intended as a VHF license on a channel 11 allocation assigned to Akron, that allocation was removed as a result of the FCC&#x27;s 1952 &quot;Sixth Report and Order&quot; in favor of two UHF allocations, one of which was not considered operable at the time. The station largely lost money in its early years and relied on profits from WAKR to remain solvent even after it moved from channel 49 to channel 23 in 1967. The ABC-TV schedule began to be carried in pattern by WAKR-TV with minimal deviations starting with the 1963–64 television season and carried &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in its entirety for the market as WEWS opted out for &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot; at 8 am, a distinction that ended in September 1994. When founding owner Summit Radio/Group One Broadcasting sold off their radio assets in 1986, the TV station was renamed WAKC.

After nearly 40 years of continuous ownership by Summit/Group One, WAKC was sold to ValueVision in late 1993; ABC immediately renewed their affiliation after the sale closed, forcing the home shopping programmer into operating the station as a conventional network affiliate. Following consummation of a subsequent sale to Paxson Communications, the station&#x27;s entire news department was fired outright on February 28, 1996, and all ABC programming was dropped that December 31. Paxson ultimately used the renamed WVPX-TV as a charter affiliate for the Pax TV network—a direct antecedent of Ion Television—which launched on August 31, 1998. Due to Scripps&#x27; purchase of Paxson&#x27;s successor company Ion Media in September 2020, WVPX was divested to Inyo Broadcast Holdings but has retained affiliations with Ion and other digital subchannel networks operated by Scripps subsidiary Katz Broadcasting.

Among WAKR-TV/WAKC&#x27;s most notable alumni are two long-tenured WEWS staffers: Ted Henry, who began his career at WAKR-AM-TV as a reporter, and Mark Johnson, who worked at WAKC as a weatherman prior to joining WEWS in 1993 as a meteorologist.

==Programming==
===Syndicated and network===
WEWS carried the 90-minute ABC premiere of &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; on December 1, 1975. On December 3, it started &quot;Edge&quot; at 10 a.m. on a one-day delay, and then later pushed up to 10:30 to make way for the national syndication of the talk show &quot;Donahue&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; was dropped in April 1977 when ABC expanded &quot;All My Children&quot; to one hour and revised the daytime lineup.

In 1969, the station gained some national attention for airing only the first half of &quot;Turn-On&quot;, because they stated it did not return to the show after the first commercial break, which guest host Tim Conway said was after &quot;15 minutes&quot; but the station claimed had happened after 10 minutes. The rest of the time slot was the emergency procedure, a black screen with live organ music that had not been used in over 20 years. The station&#x27;s spokesman claimed that the station&#x27;s switchboard was &quot;lit up&quot; with protest calls, and general manager Donald Perris derided &quot;Turn-On&quot; as being &quot;in excessive poor taste.&quot; Perris sent to ABC president Elton Rule an angry telegram: &quot;If your naughty little boys have to write dirty words on the walls, please don&#x27;t use our walls. &quot;Turn-On&quot; is turned off, as far as WEWS is concerned.&quot;

In 2004, all the Scripps-owned ABC stations preempted a showing of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.

On May 23, 2010, WEWS-TV&#x27;s broadcast of the series finale of &quot;Lost&quot; was almost completely interrupted and rendered unwatchable by a number of technical difficulties with the station&#x27;s digital signal. This caused numerous viewer complaints, leading the station to issue numerous apologies both on-air and on its website.

From the mid-1980s until 2011, WEWS was the Cleveland outlet for popular syndicated programs such as &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, and &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee/Kelly&quot;, and throughout that time frame, there was little change in the daytime lineup, as those programs consistently drew good ratings.

In 2011, Oprah Winfrey ended her show after a successful 25-year run. To fill the void, WEWS put &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot; (an &quot;Oprah&quot; spin-off hosted by Cleveland native Dr. Mehmet Oz), which was airing at 10 am, in the 4 p.m. time slot., and in subsequent years aired various other programs in that slot until settling in with a 4 p.m. newscast in fall 2018. (&quot;Dr. Oz&quot; ended up moving to WJW until the show ended its run in 2022 due to Oz&#x27;s commitments to running for the United States Senate.)

On September 14, 2012, the station dropped both &quot;Wheel&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; after airing both shows for almost three decades, replacing them with &quot;The List&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Ask America&quot;, two more internally produced shows from Scripps. The reason behind the removal of the two hit game shows was because Scripps was looking to stray away from shows that carried a high cost to air on their stations, and instead air shows where Scripps was able to control advertisement, and as a result, are much cheaper to air on their stations. Both game shows ended up moving to WOIO.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Ask America&quot; would eventually be canceled in 2015, and WEWS would replace it with the long running celebrity gossip program &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;. The station also acquired Katie Couric&#x27;s new talk show and placed it at 3 p.m. following &quot;General Hospital&quot;″s shift to 2 pm, a move that many other ABC affiliates also made. Couric&#x27;s show would be canceled two years later, and WEWS has aired various other syndicated programs in that time slot ever since. At present, only the program now known as &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot; continues to air on channel 5 from the original stable of hit syndicated shows.

===Local programming===
In its early days as an ABC affiliate, the station produced its own shows in the afternoon, as ABC offered little daytime network programming. Among the local programs offered during the 1950s and 1960s included news analysis from Dorothy Fuldheim, children&#x27;s programs featuring the &quot;Uncle Jake&quot; character played by Gene Carroll and the &quot;Captain Penny&quot; character played by Ron Penfound, and exercise programs with Paige Palmer. Alice Weston had one of the first live television cooking shows, and Barbara Plummer was &quot;Miss Barbara&quot; for a generation of young viewers on the local version of &quot;Romper Room&quot;. The most popular show was &quot;The Gene Carroll Show&quot;, a program that showcased Cleveland area talent which aired Sundays at noon beginning in 1948 and ran well into the 1970s. WEWS also offered a 90-minute afternoon variety show &quot;The One O&#x27;Clock Club&quot; weekdays hosted by Fuldheim and Bill Gordon. The program was so popular that competitor KYW-TV was prompted to organize a competing variety show which was the beginning of &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, WEWS produced several programs that eventually entered into national syndication. The first program was &quot;Upbeat&quot;. Considered by some to be one of the most significant early rock-and-roll variety television shows, &quot;Upbeat&quot; featured a live audience, a group of dancers and lip-synched (but occasionally live) performances by popular acts of the era. The program began locally as &quot;The Big 5 Show&quot;, and the name was changed to &quot;Upbeat&quot; when it went national, altogether running from 1964 to 1971. Among the program&#x27;s hosts was Don Webster, who later doubled as the station&#x27;s lead weather forecaster. At its peak, &quot;Upbeat&quot; was seen in over 100 television markets. Artists who appeared on &quot;Upbeat&quot; included Aretha Franklin, The Beatles, The Supremes, Simon and Garfunkel, Otis Redding and Stevie Wonder. In fact, Redding&#x27;s final appearance ever came on the show&#x27;s December 9, 1967, episode. The next afternoon, his twin-engine airplane crashed in the icy waters of Lake Monona in Madison, Wisconsin, killing all but one of the eight passengers on board.

Another show seen throughout the country was &quot;Polka Varieties&quot;, an hour-long polka music program that ran locally on Sundays at 1 p.m. from 1956 into the early 1980s, and was syndicated during its later years to 30 television markets. The program featured various popular bands that played Slovenian-style polka, Polish, Italian and Bohemian-style music. &quot;America&#x27;s Polka King&quot;, Frank Yankovic, was the original band to perform on the show. Other bands included Richie Vadnal, George Staiduhar, Markic-Zagger, and Hank Haller. Original host Tom Fletcher was replaced by Paul Wilcox, whose presence became an indelible part of the show. Uttering the well-known show-opening phrase, &quot;From America&#x27;s Polka Capital of Cleveland, Ohio, this is &quot;Polka Varieties&quot;, now in its ___ year on the air!&quot; were several famous voices associated with the station over the years, including Cort Stanton, Ralph Gunderman, and David Mark. &quot;Black on Black&quot;, which examined issues of importance to African American communities, was syndicated to several markets.

From the early 1970s until July 1, 2011, WEWS was Cleveland&#x27;s television outlet for the Ohio Lottery. On June 2, 2011, NBC affiliate WKYC (channel 3) announced that the station had acquired the rights to air the lottery drawings, as well as its Saturday night game show &quot;Cash Explosion&quot;. After two years on channel 3, WEWS re-assumed the local television lottery rights on July 1, 2013.

===&quot;The Morning Exchange&quot;===

One program in particular, &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot;, which ran from 1972 to 1999, changed the face of morning television. It was the first morning show to use a &quot;living room&quot; set, and the first to establish the now familiar concept of news and weather updates at the top and bottom of the hour. During its peak in the 1970s, nearly 70% of all television households in Cleveland were tuned to the program. The format also served as a template for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

From 1975 to 1978, WEWS completely preempted both &quot;AM America&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in favor of continuing with &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot;, and from 1978 to 1994, the station aired only the first hour of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, before cutting to &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot;, but it was changed by the end of 1994.

===Sports programming===
WEWS-TV has a long history of covering Cleveland sports teams both produced in-house by the station or through ABC&#x27;s network coverage. From 2015 to present, channel 5 is the official station for the NFL&#x27;s Cleveland Browns, airing all non-network preseason games as well as year-round team centered programming.

WEWS has aired two MLB World Series during the station&#x27;s existence: it broadcast the Cleveland Indians&#x27; home games in the 1948 World Series against the Boston Braves, as well as the 1995 World Series in which the Indians lost to the Atlanta Braves. During the 1995 World Series, the local broadcast was split with WKYC-TV due to the ABC/NBC-shared Baseball Network. WEWS also aired select Indians games as part of ABC&#x27;s MLB broadcast contract from 1976 to 1989.

All Cleveland Cavaliers games that air through ABC&#x27;s NBA broadcast rights are aired on channel 5; the team&#x27;s 2016 NBA Finals victory (which gave the city its first major sports championship in 52 years) aired on WEWS-TV.

===News operation===
WEWS presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, four hours on Saturdays and three hours on Sundays). In addition, the station produces the sports highlight and discussion program &quot;News 5 Sports Sunday&quot;, which airs Sunday nights following its 11 p.m. newscast.

====Early news coverage====
WEWS started covering news events soon after it went on air. The winter after it signed on, Cleveland experienced a blizzard, and for the first time WEWS had provided extended coverage for hours. During the early and mid-1950s, channel 5&#x27;s first newscasts and weather reports were delivered by Tom Field. In 1959, Dorothy Fuldheim—who had been with the station before it even first signed on—began to formulate her own newscast. Fuldheim centered her newscast around her interviews, a general overview of the news, and her commentaries (the very opinionated Fuldheim frequently inserted her own opinions about the stories). Fuldheim was the first female in the United States to have her own television news analysis program.

====&quot;Eyewitness News&quot;====
27-year-old John Hambrick took over as lead anchor on WEWS&#x27; evening newscasts on Christmas Day in 1967, with Fuldheim staying on as a commentator. Don Webster presented the weather and Gib Shanley was the sports anchor. In 1968, WEWS changed the format of its newscasts slightly to a version of &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;. In 1970, Dave Patterson joined Hambrick on the early newscast and then became co-anchor on the 11 p.m. newscast in 1971. Ted Henry, who joined WEWS in 1972 as a behind-the-scenes producer, got his start on the air later in 1975 as a weekend weatherman. In later years, Henry would admit that he, not knowing the slightest thing about forecasting, basically copied his forecasts from a Detroit radio station.

That same year, Bill Jacocks—said to be Cleveland&#x27;s first full-time African-American anchorman—joined WEWS. Jacocks started as assistant public affairs director, and became weekend anchor in January 1975. For a solid decade (until 1985) Jacocks remained the one constant weekend anchor while many co-anchors came and went. Among those doing their first Cleveland co-anchor stints with Jacocks were Tim Taylor and Wilma Smith (both of whom, coincidentally, would later anchor together at rival WJW).

Hambrick and Patterson continued to anchor the newscasts together until Hambrick left for KABC-TV in Los Angeles in 1975. At that time, Ted Henry became the weekend anchor, and then a year later in 1976, co-anchor on the weekday evening newscasts with Patterson. Henry continued as the lead anchor until his retirement on May 20, 2009. This era marked the start of dominance for the WEWS news programs that lasted until well into the 1980s. In 1977, weekend co-anchor Tim Taylor left WEWS to become a weeknight anchor at WJW-TV. Fuldheim&#x27;s role decreased as she only presented her interviews and commentaries, but still appeared on the air three times a day until retiring in July 1984 at the age of 91.

WEWS was the first Cleveland TV station to use a news helicopter, introducing &quot;Chopper 5&quot; in 1978. At the time, a cameraman sat partially outside the helicopter door to film the story being covered. TV 5 has used helicopters (on and off) ever since, including the current &quot;Air Tracker 5&quot;—which was introduced in 2016.

The WEWS news department underwent another major change in 1982. Previously, the 5–6 p.m. slot was occupied by &quot;The Afternoon Exchange&quot;, the afternoon companion to &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot;. That year, the program adopted a new format, and was renamed &quot;Live on Five&quot;. The broadcast was originally hosted by Wilma Smith and Don Webster, and retained many elements from &quot;The Afternoon Exchange&quot;, such as interviews, movie reviews, health reports, and some cooking segments. Added to the mix were news updates from Ted Henry.

In 1985, longtime sports director Gib Shanley—who attained national notoriety six years earlier when he burned an Iranian flag live on the air during a sportscast in the wake of the Iran hostage crisis—left the station, and was replaced by Nev Chandler, who became a noted sportscaster in his own right.

====&quot;News Channel 5&quot;====
In 1991, WEWS dropped the long-standing &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; branding, adopting &quot;News Channel 5&quot; as a universal branding for newscasts and station promotion. The new branding helped emphasize a format developed by the station the year prior, when WEWS positioned itself as &quot;Cleveland&#x27;s (Live) 24 Hour NewsSource&quot;. Providing news headlines to viewers at times when the station was not carrying regularly scheduled, long-form newscasts, the &quot;24-Hour News Source&quot; concept saw WEWS produce news updates running 30 seconds in length at or near the top of each hour and brief weather updates every half-hour during local commercial break inserts within syndicated and ABC network programs, in addition to the existing half-hourly updates it aired during &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. The concept would be adopted by network-affiliated television stations in other markets during the early 1990s, as a convenient means for stations to provide news coverage when syndicated or network programming aired. WEWS discontinued production of these hourly updates in 1998.

In 1994, longtime anchor Wilma Smith left the station to sign with rival WJW-TV. The same year, longtime sports director Nev Chandler died of cancer.

1995 saw a modification to the long-running &quot;Circle 5&quot;, tilting it at an angle. At this time, a major promotional campaign was launched for the station, &quot;Give Me 5&quot;, as it faced competition from WJW (then-recently having switched to Fox), WKYC (rebuilding themselves after years of being used as NBC&#x27;s farm team), and WOIO (which had just launched their own news department, in partnership with WUAB). This included a two-minute promotional video featuring James Ingram, Carly Simon and Andrea McArdle, along with numerous athletes, as well as both station personalities and ABC personalities from Cleveland. Edd Kalehoff produced the promo, as well as a comprehensive music package for the station&#x27;s newscasts and other programming.

====&quot;On Your Side&quot; era====
In 1998, WEWS adopted &quot;On Your Side&quot; as its slogan (which it currently still uses). More noticeable, however, was the discontinuance of the station&#x27;s longtime &quot;Circle 5&quot; logo. That year, WEWS also became the first television station in Cleveland to launch a website—NewsNet5. In 1999, longtime station weather forecaster Don Webster retired from the station after 35 years. In 2000, longtime sports anchor/sports director Matt Underwood left to become an announcer for the Cleveland Indians.

On January 7, 2007, WEWS became the third Cleveland television station to begin broadcasting newscasts in high-definition. At present, all locally produced portions of the station&#x27;s newscasts, including live remote field footage, are presented in HD. It was also around this time that channel 5 introduced the modified version of the classic &quot;Circle 5&quot; logo that was used until 2016. Sister station WPTV also uses the classic &quot;Circle 5&quot; logo. On May 21, 2009, Ted Henry retired as the primary news anchor at channel 5, after holding the post for 33 years. Henry is the longest serving news anchor in Cleveland television history.

In November 2010, WEWS became the first Cleveland television station to follow a growing national trend in starting its weekday morning newscasts at 4:30 a.m.

====&quot;News 5&quot; era====
On September 26, 2016, the station retired the &quot;NewsChannel 5&quot; name for its newscasts, becoming simply &quot;News 5&quot;. At the same time, the station began using a graphic identity similar to that of British television network Channel 5 (which used a similar logo from February 2011 to February 2016).

In 2017, longtime WEWS anchors Leon Bibb and Lee Jordan both announced their retirements from the station. Bibb had served as an anchor/reporter at the station since 1995 (coming over from WKYC where he had spent 16 years previous), while Jordan started at WEWS in 1987 as a co-host of &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot; before becoming an evening news anchor in 1993. To honor their tenures at the station, WEWS renamed their newsroom the Leon Bibb Newsroom, and their main studio the Lee Jordan News Studio.

On June 26, 2023, following the cancellation of &quot;The List&quot;, WEWS began airing &quot;The Debrief&quot;, a nightly newscast airing at 7 p.m. originating from and simulcast on Scripps News—a sister network of WEWS, as part of a plan by Scripps to integrate Scripps News programming on their main network affiliates as a way to promote Scripps News and increase the network&#x27;s exposure. Scripps News ceased operations as a linear channel on November 16, 2024, and with that &quot;The Debrief&quot; was canceled, and a new local 7 p.m. newscast debuted on November 18, 2024.

====Honors====
Two plaques outside the WEWS building commemorate the station&#x27;s historical contributions. The Ohio Historical Society placed a marker right outside TV 5&#x27;s building, specifically noting Dorothy Fuldheim&#x27;s career at the station. The second marker (located on the wall leading up to the front door of the station) is from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, honoring the station (along with producer Herman Spero and host Don Webster) as being the home of the popular music series &quot;Upbeat!&quot; and that program&#x27;s contributions to Rock and Roll&#x27;s history.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
On May 26, 2011, it was announced that WEWS (along with other Scripps stations around the country) had signed a deal to carry the Live Well Network on their digital subchannels. the network began to be carried on digital subchannel 5.2 on September 5, 2011. The subchannel is also currently available on select northeast Ohio cable providers.

Live Well Network announced they would be going off the air in April 2015, and as a result 5.2 switched to the classic TV network Cozi TV at 10 a.m. on April 8. The comedy network Laff debuted on the newly activated 5.3 subchannel a week later. 5.3 was activated on April 7 and ran continuous promos for the network&#x27;s launch prior to the official premiere date. On April 14, 2017, WEWS discontinued COZI on 5.2 and replaced it with Grit. On November 16, 2024, Ion Mystery replaced Grit on 5.2.

On March 1, 2021, 5.5 was activated, airing HSN programming. A year and a half later in September 2022, 5.6 was activated, airing QVC programming.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WEWS-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 15, using virtual channel 5.

<text>The Konsojaya Trading Company was a shell company cofounded by Jemaah Islamiyah leader Riduan Isamuddin, better known as &quot;Hambali&quot;, and his Malaysian Chinese wife, Noralwizah Lee Abdullah in June 1994. The company was based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

An Afghan named Wali Khan Amin Shah was one of the board of directors of the company. He also owned half (3,000) of the company&#x27;s 6,000 shares. Another member of the board of directors was Afghan Mehdat Abdul Salam Shabana, who owned the other half of the company&#x27;s shares. Another member was 30-year-old Hemeid H. Algamdi, a citizen of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Yemeni Amein Mohamed was the managing director of Konsojaya. A company profile that was circulated to suppliers and customers stated that he was the former marketing director of a Pakistan-based supplying agent for a company in Jeddah.

Konsojaya stated in its incorporation papers that it was an &quot;import/export&quot; company that shipped palm oil to Afghanistan from Malaysia. The organisation also dealt with the export of Sudanese honey. Its &quot;principal objective&quot; was to import and export products found in the Asia/Pacific region (East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania) to Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Sudan.

A man named Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who was staying in Manila, Philippines, often travelled to several places, including Brazil, to promote Konsojaya.

Konsojaya actually funneled money and material assistance to several regional militant Islamic plots. The organisation also funneled money to an account owned by Omar Abu Omar, an employee of the International Relations and Information Centre, an organisation run by Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, who is married to one of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s sisters. The money would then be siphoned into an account under the name of &quot;Adam Salih&quot;, an alias of Ramzi Yousef, who was at the time planning Manila-based Operation Bojinka, an attack that would have destroyed eleven airliners.

Manila police discovered Operation Bojinka after an apartment fire led police to a suspect on January 6 and the morning of January 7, 1995.

According to corporate records in Kuala Lumpur, Konsojaya no longer exists.

<text>Limp Richerds were an American hardcore punk rock band from Federal Way, Washington which briefly featured Mark Arm and Steve Turner (later of Mudhoney and Green River) in one of their many lineups. They formed around 1981, but ceased to be a serious band in 1984, and finally split in 1987. The original lineup was Dave Middleton (vocals), Ross Guffy (percussion), Charles Quain (guitar), and Greg Billings (bass). The band was centered on the vocals and songwriting of Dave Middleton.

<doc id="377219" wikidata="Q2255794" url="?curid=377219" title="David Thomas (musician)">
<text>David Lynn Thomas (born 1953) is an American singer, songwriter and musician, now based in the UK. He was one of the founding members of the short-lived proto-punk band Rocket from the Tombs (1974–1975), in which he played under the moniker &quot;Crocus Behemoth,&quot; and of post-punk group Pere Ubu (1975–present, intermittently). He has also released several solo albums. Though primarily a singer, he sometimes plays melodeon, trombone, musette, guitar or other instruments.

Thomas has a distinctive, high pitched voice; Emerson Dameron described Thomas&#x27;s singing as &quot;James Stewart trapped in an oboe&quot;, and Greil Marcus writes, &quot;Mr Thomas&#x27;s voice is that of a man muttering in a crowd. You think he&#x27;s talking to himself until you realize he&#x27;s talking to you.&quot;
==Biography==
Thomas was an early member of Rocket from the Tombs, which disbanded after about a year. Along with Rocket from the Tombs guitarist Peter Laughner he then formed Pere Ubu, which was originally active from 1975 to 1982.

Afterwards, Thomas worked with a variety of musicians including guitarists Richard Thompson and Philip Moxham, and Henry Cow alumni bassonist/oboist Lindsay Cooper and drummer Chris Cutler. Initially, his solo recordings eschewed Pere Ubu&#x27;s &quot;rock&quot; focus. Lindsay Cooper&#x27;s bassoon was often prominent, and, when Richard Thompson&#x27;s guitar was not featured, the guitar would be absent (such as the entirety of 1985&#x27;s &quot;More Places Forever&quot;). Thomas&#x27;s lyrics became increasingly whimsical, and birds became a common theme:

: Somewhere along the line, I wrote a song that had birds in it. And then by pure coincidence, another. Some critic asked, &quot;Why all these songs about birds?&quot; And I said to myself, &quot;You think that&#x27;s a lot of songs about birds?!? I&#x27;ll show you a lot of songs about birds!&quot; So, for a while, I stuck birds in everywhere I could.

Eventually, several former members of Pere Ubu gravitated into Thomas&#x27;s group, and by the time of 1987&#x27;s &quot;Blame the Messenger&quot;, were sporting a sound distinctly similar to the former band. This fact along with other considerations led directly into the official reformation of Pere Ubu in 1987, and the group has remained active to the present day.

Thomas appears to have been at one point a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, an affiliation that has been reflected lyrically in the final song of Pere Ubu&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;New Picnic Time&quot;, originally titled &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s Kingdom Come!&quot; However, in subsequent releases of the album, the song has been re-titled &quot;Hand A Face A Feeling&quot; and then &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;; in the albums&#x27; lyric sheet, maintained by Thomas on Pere Ubu&#x27;s official website, the titular line has been changed to &quot;God&#x27;s Kingdom Come&quot;; the song itself has been re-mixed to remove references to Jehovah.

==Current solo career==
Thomas&#x27;s solo activities were diminished, though not extinguished, by the reformation of Pere Ubu. Throughout the 1980s, Thomas maintained a rotating trio dubbed the Accordion Club, which at various times included John Kirkpatrick, Chris Cutler, Garo Yellin, and Ira Kaplan. While these groupings tended to share a repertoire with Pere Ubu, the focus was smaller. Thomas stated: &quot;I often use the same songs in both projects ... I can explore the stories behind the songs. I can extend/expand/interpolate those stories.&quot; Though the Accordion Club never recorded any albums, two songs appeared on &quot;Rē Records Quarterly Vol.2 No.1&quot;, and it led to the formation of Thomas&#x27;s current &quot;solo&quot; project, the Two Pale Boys. Devoted to &quot;spontaneous song generation&quot;, they feature Keith Moliné on guitar and Andy Diagram on &quot;trumpet through electronics;&quot; both make frequent use of MIDI, giving them a broader tonal palette than might be expected from two instruments. In addition to singing Thomas frequently plays melodeon. Says Thomas:

Pere Ubu is a big rock experience, often overwhelming in its power and intensity of dataflow. It&#x27;s a Hollywood blockbuster on a cinemascopic screen. Projects like the [Two Pale Boys] are intended as indy arthouse films.

Thomas typically has a large number of ongoing projects at any one time. He has performed in theatrical productions, including several productions by Hal Willner, and a London West End production of Shockheaded Peter. He has delivered his lecture &quot;The Geography of Sound in the Magnetic Age&quot; at Clark University and UCLA, among other venues. He has staged his &quot;improvisational opera&quot; &quot;Mirror Man&quot; at venues in Europe and North America, featuring at various times contributions from many of his previous collaborators, as well as Linda Thompson, Bob Holman, Robert Kidney, Van Dyke Parks, Frank Black, George Wendt, and Syd Straw. In 2010 he performed with the backing of Australian band The Holy Soul.

Most recently he has alternated recording and performances primarily between Pere Ubu, David Thomas and Two Pale Boys, and the reunited Rocket from the Tombs.

<doc id="377220" wikidata="Q2246183" url="?curid=377220" title="Cures, Sabinum">
<text>Cures was an ancient Sabine town in the Tiber Valley in central Italy, about from Rome, between the left bank of the Tiber and the Via Salaria. Its remains are located in the modern commune of Fara Sabina. According to legend, it was from Cures that Titus Tatius led to the Quirinal the Sabine settlers, from whom, after their union with the settlers on the Palatine, the whole Roman people took the name Quirites. Another legend, related by Dionysius, connects the foundation of Cures with the worship of the Sabine god &quot;Quirinus&quot;, whence Quirites.

It was also renowned as the birthplace of Ancient Rome&#x27;s second king Numa Pompilius. According to Livy, Numa Pompilius resided in Cures immediately prior to his election as king.

Its importance among the Sabines at an early period is indicated by the fact that its territory is often called simply ager Sabinus. At the beginning of the imperial period, it is spoken of as an unimportant place, but seems to have risen to greater prosperity in the 2nd century. Pliny notices the Curenses as one of the municipal towns of the Sabines; and numerous inscriptions of Imperial date speak of its magistrates, its municipal senate (&quot;ordo&quot;), etc., whence we may infer that it continued to be a tolerably flourishing town as late as the 4th century. In these inscriptions it is uniformly termed Cures Sabini, an epithet probably indicating the claim set up by the people to be the metropolis of the Sabines. It appears as the seat of a bishop in the 5th century, after the establishment of Christianity. The bishops assumed the title of &quot;Curium Sabinorum&quot;, and sometimes even that of &quot;Episcopus Sabinensis&quot;. The town seems to have been destroyed by the Lombards in 589 AD. An epistle of Pope Gregory I states that in 593 the site was already desolate.

The site consists of a hill with two summits, round the base of which runs the Fosso Corese: the western summit was occupied by the necropolis, the eastern by the citadel, and the lower ground between the two by the city itself. Excavations from 1874 up until 1877 revealed a temple, forum, baths, etc.

<text>Owlswick is a hamlet in Buckinghamshire, England, about 3 miles E of Thame and 4 miles SSE of Aylesbury. It is part of the civil parish of Longwick-cum-Ilmer and is in the ecclesiastical parish of Monks Risborough.

The name appears in a document of about 1200 as Ulveswike, meaning the dairy farm of Ulf, which was a Danish personal name. The district is well to the south of the Danelaw, but a man of Danish origin may have come south and settled here.

The hamlet was not mentioned in Domesday Book in 1086 because it formed part of the manor of Monks Risborough. It was later subinfeudated (i.e. granted as a feudal sub-manor) to a military subtenant and was held by knight-service by the 13th century. It continued as a separate sub-manor, paying a quit-rent to the manor of Monks Risborough until copyhold tenure was abolished in 1925.

<text>Anthony Traill (1 November 1838 – 15 October 1914) was an Irish academic who served as the 33rd Provost of Trinity College Dublin from 1904 to 1914.

Traill was born Ballylough, County Antrim, in 1838. He matriculated at Trinity College Dublin, where he was elected a Scholar in 1858. He became a fellow in 1865, and while at college he accumulated degrees in engineering, law, and medicine.

Although he was most famous for the position he would acquire later in life, Traill was actively involved in politics during the 1870s and 1880s. He was an Ulster Unionist, and sided with the landlords during the debate over land tenure reform. In 1884, he was appointed High Sheriff of Antrim. He also became the chairman of the world&#x27;s first electric tramway, Portrush, founded with his brother William. The Portrush electric tramway ran from Portrush to Bushmills from its inception in 1883 (with Traill as chairman) until 1947.

In April 1901, he was appointed Commissioner of National Education in Ireland.

In 1904, Traill was appointed Provost of Trinity College Dublin. During his hold of the office, he carried out many internal reforms. Traill refused to change the University&#x27;s constitutional position at any time in his Provostship despite pressure. He remained the Provost until he died, at the Provost&#x27;s House, in 1914.

<doc id="377228" wikidata="Q421724" url="?curid=377228" title="Cyanogen">
<text>Cyanogen is the chemical compound with the formula (CN). The simplest stable carbon nitride, it is a colorless and highly toxic gas with a pungent odor. The molecule is a pseudohalogen. Cyanogen molecules consist of two CN groups ‒ analogous to diatomic halogen molecules, such as Cl, but far less oxidizing. The two cyano groups are bonded together at their carbon atoms: N≡C‒C≡N, though other isomers have been detected. The name is also used for the CN radical, and hence is used for compounds such as cyanogen bromide (NCBr) (but see also &quot;Cyano radical&quot;). When burned at increased pressure with oxygen, it is possible to get a blue tinted flame, the temperature of which is about 4800°C (a higher temperature is possible with ozone). It is as such regarded as the gas with the second highest temperature of burning (after dicyanoacetylene).

Cyanogen is the anhydride of oxamide:

though oxamide is manufactured from cyanogen by hydrolysis:

==Preparation==
Cyanogen is typically generated from cyanide compounds. One laboratory method entails thermal decomposition of mercuric cyanide:
Or, one can combine solutions of copper(II) salts (such as copper(II) sulfate) with cyanides; an unstable copper(II) cyanide is formed which rapidly decomposes into copper(I) cyanide and cyanogen.

Industrially, it is created by the oxidation of hydrogen cyanide, usually using chlorine over an activated silicon dioxide catalyst or nitrogen dioxide over a copper salt. It is also formed when nitrogen and acetylene are reacted by an electrical spark or discharge.

==Isomers==
Cyanogen is NCCN. There are less stable isomers in which the order of the atoms differs. Isocyanogen (or cyanoisocyanogen) is NCNC, diisocyanogen is CNNC, and diazodicarbon is CCNN.

==Paracyanogen==
 Paracyanogen is a polymer of cyanogen. It can be best prepared by heating mercury(II) cyanide. It can also be prepared by heating silver cyanide, silver cyanate, cyanogen iodide or cyanuric iodide. It can also be prepared by the polymerization of cyanogen at in the presence of trace impurities. Paracyanogen can also be converted back to cyanogen by heating to . Based on experimental evidence, the structure of this polymeric material is thought to be rather irregular, with most of the carbon atoms being of sp type and localized domains of π conjugation.

==History==

Cyanogen was first synthesized in 1815 by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who determined its empirical formula and named it. Gay-Lussac coined the word &quot;cyanogène&quot; from the Greek words κυανός (kyanos, blue) and γεννάω (gennao, to create), because cyanide was first isolated by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele from the pigment Prussian blue. It attained importance with the growth of the fertilizer industry in the late 19th century and remains an important intermediate in the production of many fertilizers. It is also used as a stabilizer in the production of nitrocellulose.

Cyanogen is commonly found in comets. In 1910 a spectroscopic analysis of Halley&#x27;s Comet found cyanogen in the comet&#x27;s tail, which led to public fear that the Earth would be poisoned as it passed through the tail. People in New York wore gas masks, and merchants sold quack &quot;comet pills&quot; claimed to neutralize poisoning. Because of the extremely diffuse nature of the tail, there was no effect when the planet passed through it.

==Safety==
Like other cyanides, cyanogen is very toxic, as it readily undergoes reduction to cyanide, which poisons the cytochrome c oxidase complex, thus interrupting the mitochondrial electron transfer chain. Cyanogen gas is an irritant to the eyes and respiratory system. Inhalation can lead to headache, dizziness, rapid pulse, nausea, vomiting, loss of consciousness, convulsions, and death, depending on exposure. Lethal dose through inhalation typically ranges from .

Cyanogen produces the second-hottest-known natural flame (after dicyanoacetylene aka carbon subnitride) with a temperature of over when it burns in oxygen.

==In popular culture==
In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot; (the 5th serial of season 13), the Doctor synthesizes cyanogen using hydrogen cyanide as a starting material and vents it through a pipe to stop Solon from performing surgery on the brain of Morbius&#x27;s body.

In &quot;Dragnet&quot; (1987) Friday (Dan Aykroyd) and Streebek (Tom Hanks) are tracking down the villain who stole &quot;the pseudohalogenic compound cyanogen&quot;.

In the second season of &quot;The Night Agent&quot;, cyanogen is stolen from a chemical plant as part of a plot to manufacture a chemical weapon.

<text>In organic chemistry, isothiocyanate is a functional group as found in compounds with the formula . Isothiocyanates are the more common isomers of thiocyanates, which have the formula . 

==Occurrence==
Many isothiocyanates from plants are produced by enzymatic conversion of metabolites called glucosinolates. A prominent natural isothiocyanate is allyl isothiocyanate, also known as mustard oils. 

Cruciferous vegetables, such as bok choy, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, and others, are rich sources of glucosinolate precursors of isothiocyanates.

==Structure==
The and distances are 117 and 158 pm. By contrast, in methyl thiocyanate, and distances are 116 and 176 pm.

Typical bond angles for in aryl isothiocyanates are near 165°. Again, the thiocyanate isomers are quite different with angle near 100°. In both isomers the angle approaches 180°.

==Synthesis==
Allyl thiocyanate isomerizes to the isothiocyanate:

Isothiocyanates can be prepared by treating organic dithiocarbamate salts with lead nitrate or tosyl chloride.

Isothiocyanates may also be accessed by the fragmentation reactions of 1,4,2-oxathiazoles. This methodology has been applied to a polymer-supported synthesis of isothiocyanates.

==Reactions==
Isothiocyanates are weak electrophiles, susceptible to hydrolysis. In general, nucleophiles attack at carbon:
Electrochemical reduction gives thioformamides.

==Flavor research==
Isothiocyanates occur widely in nature and are of interest in food science and medical research. Vegetable foods with characteristic flavors due to isothiocyanates include bok choy, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, wasabi, horseradish, mustard, radish, Brussels sprouts, watercress, papaya seeds, nasturtiums, and capers. These species generate isothiocyanates in different proportions, and so have different, but recognizably related, flavors. They are all members of the order Brassicales, which is characterized by the production of glucosinolates, and of the enzyme myrosinase, which acts on glucosinolates to release isothiocyanates.
* Sinigrin is the precursor to allyl isothiocyanate
* Glucotropaeolin is the precursor to benzyl isothiocyanate
* Gluconasturtiin is the precursor to phenethyl isothiocyanate
* Glucoraphanin is the precursor to sulforaphane

==Uses==
Phenyl isothiocyanate, is used for amino acid sequencing in the Edman degradation.

==Coordination chemistry==
Isothiocyanate and its linkage isomer thiocyanate are ligands in coordination chemistry. Thiocyanate is a more common ligand.

<doc id="377232" wikidata="Q294706" url="?curid=377232" title="AMC Javelin">
<text>The AMC Javelin is an American front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, two-door hardtop automobile manufactured by American Motors Corporation (AMC) across two generations, 1968 through 1970 and 1971 through 1974 model years. The car was positioned and marketed in the pony car market segment.

Styled by Dick Teague, the Javelin was available in a range of trim and engine levels, from economical pony car to muscle car variants. In addition to manufacture in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Javelins were assembled under license in Germany, Mexico, Philippines, Venezuela, as well as Australia – and were marketed globally. American Motors also offered discounts to U.S. military personnel, and cars were taken overseas.

The Javelin won the Trans-Am race series in 1971, 1972, and 1976. The second-generation AMX variant was the first pony car used as a standard vehicle for highway police car duties by an American law enforcement agency.

==Development==
American Motors&#x27; Javelin was the company&#x27;s entrant into the &quot;pony car&quot; market. The segment was created by the Ford Mustang even if Ford&#x27;s car was not the first entry. The Javelin&#x27;s design evolved from two prototype cars named AMX that were shown in AMC&#x27;s &quot;Project IV&quot; auto show circuit during 1966. One was a fiberglass two-seat &quot;AMX&quot;, and the other was a four-seat &quot;AMX II&quot;. These offerings reflected the company&#x27;s strategy to shed its &quot;economy car&quot; image and appeal to a more youthful, performance-oriented market.

Sales of convertibles were dropping, and AMC did not have the resources to design separate fastback and notchback hardtops that were available on the Mustang and the second-generation Plymouth Barracuda, so the AMC styling team led by Dick Teague penned only one body style, &quot;a smooth semi-fastback roofline that helped set Javelin apart from other pony cars.&quot;

The Javelin was built on AMC&#x27;s &quot;junior&quot; (compact) Rambler American platform only as a two-door hardtop model to be a &quot;hip&quot;, dashing, affordable pony car, as well as available in muscle car performance versions. &quot;Despite management&#x27;s insistence on things like good trunk space and rear-seat room, Teague managed to endow the Javelin with what he termed the &quot;wet T-shirt&quot; look: voluptuous curves with nary a hint of &quot;fat&quot;.&quot;

==First generation==


The Javelin debuted on 22 August 1967, for the 1968 model year, and the new models were offered for sale from 26 September 1967, with prices starting at $2,743.

The car incorporated several safety innovations, including interior windshield posts that were &quot;the first industry use of fiberglass safety padding&quot;, and the flush-mounted paddle-style door handles. To comply with National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety standards there were exterior side marker lights, and three-point seat belts and headrests for the front seats. The interior was devoid of bright trim to help reduce glare.

American Motors marketed the Javelin as offering &quot;comfortable packaging with more interior and luggage space than most of its rivals&quot; with adequate leg- and headroom in the back and a trunk capacity of . There were no side vent windows. Flow-through ventilation extracted interior air through apertures in the doors controlled by adjustable flap valves at the door armrests&#x27; bottom. All Javelins came with thin-shell bucket seats and a fully carpeted interior. The SST model added appearance and comfort features, including reclining front seatbacks with upgraded upholstery, simulated wood-grained door panel trim, a sports-style steering wheel, and bright exterior trim for the drip rail and rocker panel. The Javelin&#x27;s instruments and controls were set deep in a padded panel in front of the driver, with the rest of the dashboard set well forward and away from the front passenger.

The car&#x27;s front end had what AMC called a &quot;twin-venturi&quot; look with a recessed honeycomb grille and outboard-mounted headlamps, and matching turn signals were set into the bumper. A pair of simulated air scoops on the hood and the windshield was raked at 59 degrees for a &quot;sporty overall appearance.&quot;

&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine compared a Javelin favorably to its competitors on its introduction in 1968, describing its &quot;big, heavy, super-powerful engine&quot; as &quot;an asset in such a small vehicle&quot;, and the styling as &quot;pleasant&quot;. &quot;Motor Trend&quot;, putting the Javelin at the top of the &quot;sports-personal&quot; category in its annual &quot;Car of the Year&quot; issue, said it was &quot;the most significant achievement for an all-new car&quot; and &quot;the most notable new entry in [its] class.&quot;

Available only in a two-door hardtop, body style, the Javelin came in base and more premium &quot;SST&quot; models. The standard engine was a straight-6. Optional were a V8 with two-barrel carburetor, and a V8 in regular gasoline two-barrel or high-compression premium-fuel four-barrel versions. Racing driver Gordon Johncock said the Javelin had &quot;a nice, all-round blend of features&quot;, that it &quot;stacks up as a roomy, comfortable, peppy and handsome example of a so-called &quot;pony car&quot; and that after his road test, he &quot;wanted to take it home.&quot;

With the standard straight-six engine, the Javelin cruised at when equipped with an automatic transmission. In comparison, those with the base V8 had a top speed of . A three-speed &quot;Shift-Command&quot; automatic transmission was optional with a center console-mounted gear selector. Forward settings included &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and a &quot;D&quot; mode that was fully automatic, and the driver could choose to shift manually through all three gears.

The optional &quot;Go Package&quot; included a four-barrel carbureted AMC V8, power front disc brakes, heavy-duty suspension, dual exhausts with chromed outlets, broad full-length body-side stripes, and E70x14 red-line tires mounted on chrome-plated &quot;Magnum 500&quot; styled road wheels. A 343 Go Pac Javelin could accelerate from 0 to in 8 seconds, had a top speed approaching , and could run a quarter-mile in 15.4 seconds. The largest engine in the first few months of 1968 production was &quot;a 5.6 litre V-8 that delivered 284 SAE bhp, which made the car dangerously fast.&quot;

In mid-1968, the new engine was offered as part of the &quot;Go-package&quot; option with a floor-mounted automatic or manual four-speed transmission. &quot;Its impressive and of torque could send the Javelin from zero to in the seven-second range.&quot;

American Motors supported the AMX and the Javelin muscle versions with a range of factory-approved &quot;Group 19&quot; dealer-installed performance accessories. These parts included, among others, dual four-barrel cross-ram intake manifolds, high-performance camshaft kits, needle-bearing roller rocker arms, and dual-point ignition.

The average age of the &quot;first 1,000 Javelin buyers was 29 – a full ten years under the median for all AMC customers.&quot; The Javelin&#x27;s marketing campaign, created by Mary Wells Lawrence of the Wells, Rich, and Greene agency was innovative and daring in its approach. Print and TV advertisements broke with the traditional convention of not attacking the competition, and some compared the AMC Javelin to the Ford Mustang side by side, as well as showing the Mustang being beaten to pieces with sledgehammers.

The car was longer and roomier than the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro, but not the size of the larger Plymouth Barracuda. Comparison testing of six 1968 pony cars by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; described the Javelin as having &quot;a clean understated appearance that is not marred by phony vents, power bulges, mounds or bizarre sculpturing of whatever variety. The Javelin is an honest-looking car with a dramatic flair.&quot;

Total production for the 1968 model year was 55,125.

===1969===
Minor changes for the second model year included revised side striping, an altered grille with a bull&#x27;s eye emblem, and trim upgrades. An optional side-stripe package consisted of a C-shaped graphic that started behind the front wheel openings. The optional (standard with the &quot;Go-Package&quot;) five-spoke Magnum 500 steel road wheels now came with a stainless steel trim ring. The interior received new door panels and upgraded carpeting. Instrumentation featured a 0–8,000 rpm tachometer that now matched the speedometer in style. Late model-year production received a cowl over the instrument panel directly before the driver.

The &quot;Mod Javelin&quot; Package was introduced mid-year in 1969. It included a &quot;Craig Breedlove&quot; roof-mounted spoiler, simulated &quot;exhaust&quot; rocker trim, and twin blacked-out simulated air scoops on the hood. Optional &quot;Big Bad&quot; paint (neon brilliant blue, orange, or green) also became available from mid-1969. It came with matching front and rear painted bumpers, as well as two vertical rubber-faced painted bumper guards for the rear and a bright lower grille molding on the painted front bumper. This was part of AMC&#x27;s targeting youthful consumers as they were &quot;dumping the drab.&quot; These bright colors were available on all Javelins through 1970.

The Go-Package option was available with the four-barrel 343 or 390 engines and continued to include disc brakes, &quot;Twin-Grip&quot; (limited slip) differential, red-line performance E70x14 tires on &quot;Magnum 500&quot; styled wheels, heavy-duty suspension with thicker sway-bars, and other enhancements. Starting in January 1969, the four-speed manual transmissions included a Hurst floor shifter (AMC&#x27;s version of the Hurst Competition Plus model) to provide shorter throws between gears and make it feel firmer and more solid.

The production total for the 1969 model year was 40,675.

===Racing===
American Motors entered the Javelin in dragstrip and Trans-Am Series racing.

Carl Chakmakian was the primary contact for the AMC racing program. In 1968, AMC contracted Kaplan Engineering (Ron Kaplan and Jim Jeffords) to campaign two AMC Javelins in the SCCA&#x27;s Trans-Am series. For the 1968 season, three cars were prepared: two for racing and one for shows and demonstrations.

The first year of the AMC program was a success; journalists described the team as a &quot;Cinderella&quot; team. American Motors placed third in the over-2-liter class of the 1968 series, and established a record as the only factory entry to finish every Trans-Am race entered.

During the 1968 season, the team consistently improved and suffered only one &quot;did not finish&quot; (DNF) because of an engine problem. The race program was supporting a company with no performance parts, test facility, or technical support for the program. Production cars Javelins had no anti-dive potential built into the uni-body and only single-barrel carburetor manifolds.

The team&#x27;s performance in 1968 was due to the efforts of Kaplan, his staff, and help from other West Coast manufacturers. Kaplan set out to resolve handling problems and fix engine oiling problems. Mid-season, he also started the development of a dual-carburetor cross-ram manifold and (looking ahead) a new engine casting.

The development of the Watt&#x27;s linkage rear suspension came first. The front anti-dive geometry followed quickly. Kaplan copied the basic design of the inner fender components from a Mustang. He added two more degrees of anti-dive to the Mustang&#x27;s 4 degrees, made the drawings, and sent them to the factory. Central Stamping constructed the parts that Kaplan incorporated into the cars as bodies in white. Other suspension parts were acquired through specialty manufacturers.

The building of reliable and powerful engines took more time. The team started the 1968 season with two engines from TRACO. They worked to resolve oiling issues and develop as much power as possible; the single-carb layout and the basic two-bolt-main block were limitations. Kaplan went to Vic Edelbrock to develop a cross-ram manifold. Champion spark plugs provided their dyno room.

Towards the end of 1968, Kaplan enlisted help from Dan Byer, a retired engineer from AMC, to develop a new block casting. Using AMC 390 engineering drawings, they added more mass for four-bolt mains and improved the oiling system. A run of 50 blocks was contracted to Central Foundries in Windsor, Ontario. Because this was a small run, and there was little factory support, it fell to Kaplan and his staff to clean up the blocks from the sand casting, hone the various passages, and, finally, send them to AMC&#x27;s &quot;Parts Central&quot; in Kenosha. From there, they could draw on the inventory. The blocks were painted bright orange. Kaplan drew on about 12 special castings during the development program, two sold to customers.

Kaplan&#x27;s preparations included shaving the deck on the new block by about 5/8-inch and heavily modifying the ports. The new cross-ram manifold was installed, and Kaplan would add his specifically designed pistons, a shorter throw crankshaft, and a new camshaft. While a few engines were lost during testing, the design proved reliable.

In the intervening period, AMC replaced Kaplan&#x27;s race program contact with two new men (Chris Schoenlip and John Voelbel from Lever Brothers, who still needed to gain experience in the automotive field and racing. The two new employees did not enter the parts into the official AMC parts system and submit homologation papers. Kaplan sent the first car to run at the first race of the 1969 season in Jackson, Michigan. It was one of the older 1968 cars with a new engine, but because they were late and had not qualified, the team had to do some consensus-building among the other racers to permit them to enter. When the SCCA agreed to let them run, they started last, but within ten laps, they were chasing Donohue, and the time differential was narrowing rapidly. After the race, the SCCA asked to see the engine, but he had already sent the cars home. At Lime Rock, the SCCA wanted to tear down the engines before they could start the race. Kaplan bought some time by countering the challenge that they also had to tear down the Camaros and Mustangs. That was not going to happen, so they were allowed to run. However, problems with the SCCA would continue until the parts could be homologated. AMC eventually assigned a part number.

For 1969, the season began with Ron Grable (#4) and John Martin (#3). This time, it was Martin who was released mid-season. Jerry Grant replaced him in the No. 3 car.

At this point, Kaplan approached AMC management and proposed modifying the concept behind the 1969 contract. He suggested that AMC should not compete in the actual races since the new engines were not recognized and the old engines needed to be competitive. Kaplan suggested that they instead go to the tracks on the subsequent Mondays and run a developmental program using Sunday&#x27;s winning times as the benchmark. AMC disagreed, and Kaplan ran the year with the engines on hand. The results could have been better because the older-style engines were not competitive. There were also budget cuts.

After the final race at Riverside, Kaplan dropped all of AMC&#x27;s material at their zone office in El Segundo, California, and took a month to think about the following year. When he returned, he found that a deal was made with Roger Penske.

Penske picked up the team cars and equipment from the El Segundo offices and shipped everything back to his shop in Pennsylvania. Through the fall of 1969 and into the winter, Penske used the no. 3 Jerry Grant car for developmental purposes. When he acquired the 1969 cars, Penske found that Ron Kaplan had already done considerable work with suspension, but he felt the front suspension could be better. With Mark Donohue doing the testing, Penske&#x27;s team lowered the front of the car and replaced the rubber bushings in the radius rods with heim joints. New roll bars were also developed. After several months of development, Donohue felt the team now had a car that drove like it was on rails.

At this point, Penske built all-new cars for his team and sold all the earlier Kaplan cars and equipment. Mark Donohue was in charge of selling off the inventory.

==Redesign==
===1970===
The 1970 Javelins were a one-year-only design featuring a new front-end design with a broad &quot;twin-venturi&quot; front grille incorporating the headlamps, a new bumper design without air intakes, smooth front fender extensions, and a longer hood in standard smooth version with twin rectangular stripped bright trim pieces or with a prominent center bulge with non-functional dual air intake trim or a functional Ram Air system with the Go-Package. The previous taillamps with side fender lenses, dual backup lamps, and a center reflector with a Javelin emblem were replaced with full-width lenses, a single central backup light, and the Javelin emblem moved to the right corner of the trunk lid. The side marker light design, now shared by other AMC cars, was more prominent and rectangular, with reflector sections in amber at the front or red at the rear. The exterior rearview mirror featured a new &quot;aero&quot; design. The housing was chrome or matched the car&#x27;s body color. The three &quot;Big Bad&quot; exterior paints continued to be optional on the 1970 Javelins, but they now came with regular chrome front and rear bumpers.

A new front suspension featured ball joints, upper and lower control arms, coil springs, shock absorbers above the upper control arms, and trailing struts on the lower control arms. The 1970 Javelins also introduced Corning&#x27;s new safety glass, which was thinner and lighter than standard laminated windshields. This unique glass featured a chemically hardened outer layer. It was produced in Blacksburg, Virginia, in a refitted plant that included tempering, ion exchange, and &quot;fusion process&quot; in new furnaces that Corning had developed to be able to supply to the big automakers.

American Motors changed the engine lineup for 1970 models by introducing two new V8 engines: a base and an optional to replace the 290 and the 343 versions. The top optional continued. However, it was upgraded with new cylinder heads featuring 51 cc combustion chambers and a single 4-barrel Autolite 4300 carburetor, increasing power to at 5000 rpm and maximum torque of at 3200 rpm. The engine&#x27;s code remained &quot;X&quot; on the vehicle identification number (VIN). Also new was the &quot;power blister&quot; hood, featuring two large openings as part of a functional cold ram-air induction system; this was included with the &quot;Go Package&quot; option.

Many buyers selected the &quot;Go Package,&quot; with the 360 or 390 four-barrel V8 engines. As in prior years, this package included front disc brakes, a dual exhaust system, heavy-duty suspension with an anti-sway bar, improved cooling, 3.54 rear axle ratio, and wide Goodyear white-lettered performance tires on styled road wheels.

The interior for 1970 was also a one-year design featuring a broad dashboard (with a wood-grained overlay on SST models), new center console, revised interior door panel trim, and tall &quot;clamshell&quot; bucket seats with integral headrests available in vinyl, corduroy, or optional leather upholstery. A new two-spoke steering wheel with a &quot;Rim Blow&quot; horn was optional. Console-mounted automatic transmissions featured a new &quot;pistol-grip&quot; shifter.

A comparison road test of four 1970 pony cars by &quot;Popular Science&quot; described the Javelin&#x27;s interior as the roomiest with good visibility except for small blind spots in the right rear quarter and over the large hood scoop, while also offering the most trunk capacity of all, measuring . It was a close second to the Camaro in terms of ride comfort, while the engine offered &quot;terrific torque.&quot; The Javelin with the four-speed manual transmission was also the quickest of the cars tested, reaching 0 to in 6.8 seconds.

Capitalizing on the Javelin&#x27;s successes on the race track, AMC began advertising and promoting unique models.

====Mark Donohue Javelin====

The &quot;Mark Donohue Javelin&quot; was built to homologate the Donohue-designed rear ducktail spoiler. A total of 2,501 SST trim versions were made with the rear spoiler featuring his signature on the right side. Designed for Trans Am racing, the rules required factory production of 2,500 cars equipped with parts used for racing. The original plan was to have all Donohue Javelins built in SST trim with the unique spoiler, as well as the &quot;Go Package&quot; with Ram Air hood, a choice of a four-speed or automatic transmission on the floor, and a engine with thicker webbing that allowed it to have four-bolt mains. Ultimately, the factory fitted the cars with the standard 360 or 390 engines. The Javelins could be ordered in any color (including &quot;Big Bad&quot; exteriors), upholstery, and any combination of extra-cost options.

American Motors did not include any specific identification (VIN code or door tag, other than the factory-printed window sticker and dealer documentation) to discern them. The &quot;Mark Donohue Ducktail Spoiler&quot; is itemized as a separate $58.30 option separately from the &quot;Go Package&quot; and other equipment on the Monroney sticker. Moreover, some Donohue Javalins cars came through with significant differences in equipment from the factory, while some dealers made their versions. This makes it easy to replicate and correspondingly difficult to authenticate a &quot;real&quot; Mark Donohue Javelin.

====Trans-Am Javelin====
American Motors celebrated the heroic achievements of its Trans Am series racing by making an estimated one hundred &quot;Trans-Am&quot; versions. These Javelins replicated the appearance of the race cars prepared by Ronnie Kaplan. They were not stripped racecar reversions, but designed for the street by including features such as such as comfortable seating and power-assisted steering and front disc brakes. All &quot;Trans-Am&quot; factory-built Javelins included the V8 engine with heavy-duty and performance features along with the front and rear spoilers, and were also painted in AMC racing team&#x27;s distinctive Matador Red, Frost White, and Commodore Blue &quot;hash&quot; paint livery.

The Trans Am Javelin had a significant advantage because of its weight, versus the Chevrolet Camaro and the Ford Mustang scaling up to . The Javelin was one of the lightest racing competitors, and &quot;since everything was paired perfectly, a nimble performance car that could rule the streets, just like it did on the Trans Am racing circuit.&quot; Marketed to promote AMC&#x27;s successes in SCCA racing, the Trans-Am Javelin&#x27;s retail price was $3,995.

===Racing===
One of the biggest surprises of the 1970 motorsports season was the announcement that Penske Racing had taken over the AMC Javelin program, thus leaving the Camaro Trans-Am program to Jim Hall. American Motors hired Roger Penske and driver Mark Donohue to seriously campaign Javelins in SCCA Trans-Am Series. This coincided with the change in the Trans-Am rulebook allowing manufacturers to de-stroke pre-existing corporate engines, so AMC&#x27;s was used as the starting point to meet the displacement rule that was still in place. The team included former Shelby chassis engineer Chuck Cantwell and a clockwork pit crew. The two-car Javelin effort provided the Bud Moore Ford Boss 302 Mustangs their &quot;closest competition.&quot; AMC finished in second place in the Over 2-liter class of the 1970 series.

The strong participation by AMC in Trans-Am and drag racing served to enhance its image, and notable was that its motorsports efforts were achieved on a shoestring budget with the automaker racking up a respectable number of points against its giant competitors. For example, with an estimated 4.5 million participants and 6 million spectators, drag racing was the fastest-growing segment of motorsport in the U.S. The marketing strategy was to appeal to buyers who otherwise would not give AMC a second glance.

==Second generation==
The AMC Javelin was restyled for the 1971 model year. It followed the pony market segment trend to &quot;bigger, beefier vehicles.&quot; The &quot;1980-looking Javelin&quot; design was purposely made to give the sporty car &quot;individuality ... even at the risk of scaring some people off.&quot; Chuck Mashigan headed the redesign. The Javelin&#x27;s long hood sloped downward at the front, the front fenders included raised blisters over the wheels, the rear fenders were flared, and the roof included &quot;twin canopy&quot; recesses, thus &quot;endowing it with the appearance of an expensive European exotic.&quot;

The second generation looked much larger than the previous Javelins. Wheelbase was increased by to . However, height was dropped by , and the most significant difference was in the width increase that was accompanied by a wider rear track, thus &quot;improving both looks and handling.&quot;

The indicated engine power outputs also changed from those advertised through 1971, to more realistic calculations starting in 1972. The actual power output of the engine remained the same. Still, the U.S. automobile industry followed the SAE horsepower rating method that changed from &quot;gross&quot; in 1971 and prior years to &quot;net&quot; in 1972 and later years.

===1971===
The second generation AMC Javelin design incorporated an integral roof spoiler and sculpted fender bulges. The new body departed from the gentle, tucked-in look of the original.

The media noted the revised front fenders (originally designed to accommodate oversized racing tires) that &quot;bulge up as well as out on this personal sporty car, borrowing lines from the much more expensive Corvette.&quot; The new design also featured an &quot;intricate injection molded grille.&quot;

The car&#x27;s dashboard was asymmetrical, with &quot;functional instrument gauges that wrap around you with cockpit efficiency&quot;. The dashboard design continued to the driver&#x27;s door panel. Toggle switches for the lights, wipers, and other controls were positioned in front of the driver while the radio was to the right, and the center section housed the climate controls and the ashtray.

The Javelins provided a choice of engines and transmissions that included a I6 up to the V8 with a single four-barrel carburetor and high compression ratio of 9.5:1 rated at at 5000 rpm and at 3400 rpm of torque with a forged steel crankshaft and connecting rods engineered to withstand 8000 rpm. The BorgWarner T-10 four-speed manual transmission came with a Hurst floor shifter.

Three models were available: the base Javelin, SST, and AMX. Starting with the 1971 model year, the AMX was no longer a separate two-seater line. It evolved into a premium high-performance edition of the Javelin. The base version included vinyl upholstered bucket seats in four colors, full carpeting, molded door panels with integral armrests, and full-length body side pinstripes. The SST model included additional bright moldings and full-wheel covers. The interior featured upgraded upholstery, simulated burled walnut trim in the dashboard and door panels, a &quot;rim-blow&quot; sports steering wheel, and other enhancements. In addition to the standard V8 engine, the AMX included engine-turned interior trim, sports console, dual outside rearview mirrors, rear spoiler, 14x6-inch spoke-style wheels with E70x14 fiberglass belted tires with raised white letters, a heavy-duty clutch, and a unique grille. The only tire upgrade for the AMX was E60x15 raised while letters with 15-inch &quot;slot-style wheels.

The new Javelin-AMX incorporated several racing modifications, and AMC advertised it as &quot;the closest thing you can buy to a Trans-Am champion&quot;. The car had a fiberglass full-width cowl induction hood, as well as spoilers front and rear for high-speed traction. Testing at the Ontario Motor Speedway by the Penske Racing Team recorded that the 1971 Javelin AMX&#x27;s rear spoiler added of downforce. Mark Donohue also advised AMC to make the AMX&#x27;s grille flush for improved airflow. Thus, the performance model received a stainless steel mesh screen over the standard Javelin&#x27;s deep openings.

The performance-upgrade &quot;Go Package&quot; provided the choice of a 360 or 401 4-barrel engine and included &quot;Rally-Pac&quot; instruments, a handling package for the suspension, &quot;Twin-Grip&quot; limited-slip differential, heavy-duty cooling, power-assisted disc brakes, white-letter E60x15 Goodyear Polyglas tires (on 15x7-inch styled slotted steel wheels) used on the Rebel Machine, a T-stripe hood decal, and a blacked-out rear taillight panel.

The 1971 Javelin AMX with a V8 ran the quarter-mile in the mid-14 second range at on low-lead, low-octane gas.


===1972===
The 1972 model year AMC Javelins featured a new &quot;egg crate&quot; front grille design with a similar pattern repeated on the chrome overlay over the full-width taillights. The AMX version continued with the flush grille. A total of 15 exterior colors were offered with optional side stripes.

To consolidate the product offering, reduce production costs, and offer more value to consumers, the 1972 AMC Javelins were equipped with more standard comfort and convenience items. The base model was discontinued. Engine power ratings were downgraded to the more accurate Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) net horsepower figures. Automatic transmissions were now the TorqueFlite units sourced from Chrysler, called &quot;Torque-Command&quot; by AMC.

American Motors achieved record sales in 1972 by focusing on quality and including an innovative warranty called the &quot;Buyer Protection Plan&quot; to back its products. This was the first time an automaker promised to repair anything wrong with the car (except for tires) for one year or . Owners were provided with a toll-free telephone number to AMC, as well as a complimentary loaner car if a repair to their vehicle took more than a day.

By this time, the pony car market segment was declining in popularity. One commentator has said that &quot;[d]espite the Javelin&#x27;s &quot;great lines and commendable road performance, it never quite matched the competition in the sales arena ... primarily because the small independent auto maker did not have the reputation and/or clout to compete with GM, Ford, and Chrysler&quot;.

===Pierre Cardin===
During the 1972 and 1973 model years, a total of 4,152 Javelins were produced with optional interior design by fashion designer Pierre Cardin. The official on-sale date was 1 March 1972. The design features pleated red, plum, white, and silver stripes on a black background. Six multi-colored stripes in a nylon fabric with a stain-resistant silicone finish go from the front seats, up the doors, onto the headliner, and down to the rear seats. Chatham Mills produced the fabric for the seat faces. Cardin&#x27;s crest appeared on the front fenders. MSRP of the option was $84.95. A 2007 magazine article described the design as the &quot;most daring and outlandish&quot; of its kind.

===1973===
The 1973 model year Javelins incorporated several updates, most noticeably in the design of the taillights and grille, although the AMX grille remained the same. While all other AMC models had bumpers with telescopic shock absorbers, the Javelin and AMX were fitted with a non-telescopic design that had two rigid rubber guards. These allowed the cars to withstand a front and rear impacts without damage to the engine, lights, and safety equipment. The doors were also made stronger to comply with new U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety standards that they withstand of impact for the first of crush. The &quot;twin-cove&quot; indentations were eliminated from the Javelin&#x27;s roof and a full vinyl top was made available. The 1970–1972 &quot;Turtle Back&quot; front seats were replaced by a slimmer, lighter, and more comfortable design that provided more legroom for rear-seat passengers. The SST model was dropped, and the car was now called Javelin.

All engines incorporated new emissions controls. The 1973 V8 was rated at net and achieved 0 to 60 mph acceleration in 7.7 seconds with a top speed of , despite the Javelin&#x27;s four-place size and weight. Performance figures conducted by &quot;Road Test&quot; magazine of a 1973 Javelin SST with the 4-barrel V8 engine and four-speed manual transmission resulted in &quot;respectable&quot; quarter-mile (402 m) dragstrip runs of 15.5 seconds at .

American Motors continued its comprehensive &quot;Buyer Protection&quot; extended warranty on all 1973 models that now covered food and lodging expenses of up to $150 should a car require overnight repairs when the owner is more than away from home. The automaker promoted improved product quality with an advertising campaign that emphasized, &quot;We back them better because we build them better&quot;. Profits for the year achieved a record high.

Javelin production for the 1973 model year totaled 30,902 units, including 5,707 AMX units.

===Trans Am Victory edition===
Javelins driven in the Trans-Am captured the racing title for American Motors in both the 1971 and 1972 seasons. The back-to-back SCCA championships with specially prepared race cars were celebrated by AMC by offering a limited run of &quot;Trans Am Victory&quot; edition 1973 Javelins. The package was available on cars built from October to 15 December 1972, on any Javelin SST, except with the Cardin interior. A single magazine advertisement, featuring the winning race drivers George Follmer and Roy Woods, promoted the special package.

These cars came packaged with an additional cost optional visibility group, light group, insulation group, protection group, and sports-style steering wheel, but also received at no additional cost (but valued at $167.45) three other features—large &quot;Javelin Winner Trans Am Championship 1971–1972 SCCA&quot; fender decals on the lower portion behind the front wheel openings, 8-slot rally styled steel wheels with E70x14 Polyglass raised white letter tires and a &quot;Space-Saver&quot; spare tire. The Trans Am Victory cars were also typically pre-built, even more &quot;heavily optioned than regular production Javelins.&quot; American Motors designed a quick identification system of its models by an information-rich Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) system. However, because this was only a limited promotional &quot;value added&quot; marketing campaign, except as noted on the original window sticker, there is no VIN or door tag code to distinguish an authentic Trans Am-Victory edition car.

===1974===
The 1974 model year AMC Javelins included upgraded front and rear bumpers with standard bumper guards. An optional enlarged bumper guard system was required in California, Georgia, Maryland, and North Carolina. Front disc brakes became standard equipment while radial tires became optional. The functional cowl-induction fiberglass hood that was previously part of the &#x27;Go Package&#x27; of performance options was no longer available for 1974, tho its non-functional twin remained the standard hood on Javelin-AMX versions. Some very-late-production Javelin-AMXs came with the base, flat steel hoods when inventory of the cowled hoods ran out. Engines featured induction-hardened exhaust valve seats, and all could use regular, low-lead, or no-lead gasoline. The output of the V8 dropped by .

A new seatbelt interlock system prevented the car from being started if the driver and a front passenger were unbuckled. Lawmakers repealed this safety feature due to public opposition.

By 1974, the automobile marketplace had changed. Mid-year, Chrysler abandoned the pony car market. Whereas Ford replaced its original Mustang with a smaller four-cylinder version, and other pony car manufacturers also downsized engines, the Javelin&#x27;s big engine option continued until the production of the model ended in October/November 1974 amidst the Arab oil embargo and overall declining interest in high-performance vehicles.

The 1974 AMX did not do as well in the marketplace compared to the new Camaro, Firebird, and the downsized Mustang II – all of which saw increased sales. Javelin production meanwhile reached a second-generation high of 27,696 units. Out of that total number, a total of 4,980 Javelin-AMX models were produced for the final model year.

Several factors led to the demise of the Javelin model, not the least of which was the economic climate of the time. While the 1974 model was exempt from stricter 1974 bumper standards, AMC estimated it would take $12 million in engineering and design work to revise the bumpers to meet the 1975 standards.

American Motors also introduced the all-new 1974 Matador coupe, described by &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; as &quot;smooth and slippery and actually competes with the Javelin for &quot;boss&quot; muscle-car styling&quot;. The automaker also needed a manufacturing line to build its all-new AMC Pacer. Nevertheless, more cars were built during the final year of Javelin production than the prior second-generation years, with 27,696 units built, of which 4,980 (about 15 percent) were Javelin AMX models.

===Racing===
Racing AMC Javelin versions competed successfully in the Trans-Am Series with the Penske Racing/Mark Donohue team, as well as with the Roy Woods ARA team sponsored by American Motors Dealers. The Javelin won the Trans-Am title in 1971, 1972, and 1976. Drivers included George Follmer and Mark Donohue.

One Javelin race car had the distinction of having different sponsors and being piloted by Mark Donohue, Vic Elford, George Follmer, Peter Revson, and Roy Woods. This Javelin began as a 1970 model, but was updated with the exterior body design of 1971 versions. The race car is now restored to its 1972 livery and is driven at Vintage Trans-Am events.

Jim Richards raced a Javelin AMX in the Touring Car Masters in Australia, coming second in the overall 2012 series. He earned second place in the 2015 Touring Car Masters (Pro Masters Class) Series.

==Police==
Alabama faced a budget shortfall in 1971 and could not purchase a fleet of the full-sized Fords the state troopers were accustomed to. To find a more suitable and lower-priced alternative to the traditional large-sized police cruisers, the Alabama Department of Public Safety (ADPS) first took a basic V8 as a test vehicle, found its power lacking, then sampled a vinyl roofed AMX with a engine from the local dealer, Reinhart AMC in Montgomery. The Javelin AMX version went through the trooper reviews and became &quot;the most abused police car in the history of Alabama.&quot; The car was eventually donated to the ADPS by Reinhardt Motors.

Law enforcement vehicles were typically full-sized sedans and could not keep up with speeders. The Javelins equipped with the engine proved their performance, and beginning in 1971, the Alabama Highway Patrol used them for pursuit and high-speed response calls.

The 132 Javelins purchased between 1971 and 1972 were the first pony cars used as regular highway patrol police cars by any U.S. law-enforcement organization. The bid price was $3,047 for the 1971 police cruisers, and $3,242 for the 1972 model year versions.

The 1971 cars were base model Javelins with the fleet-service four-barrel dual-exhaust V8 that was available in the full-sized Ambassadors with police-package and cast-iron Borg-Warner three-speed automatic transmission. The cars did not have the complete &quot;Go-Package&quot; equipment leaving out the cowl-induction hood, limited-slip differential, and its 3.91 ratio. The cars included a rear spoiler, power disk brakes, power steering, air conditioning, heavy-duty suspension, three-core radiator, &quot;Rally&quot; instruments with the 140 mph speedometer, and E60x15 Polyglass tires on &quot;Machine&quot; wheels, and 2.97 rear axle ratio. Changes with the 1972 Javelins included AMC&#x27;s switch to the Chrysler TorqueFlite transmissions, eight-slot road wheels replaced the &quot;Machine&quot; design, and all cars were SST models because the base version was no longer available.

The ADPS added decals, a beacon, a siren, and a police radio. Archives document high-speed chases in which high-performance car drivers had to surrender to the ADPS Javelins. The cars were powerful. Their lightweight with the 2.87 rear axle ratio contributed to top speeds of over .

Most of the ADPS Javelins were in service until June 1974. The last of ADPS Javelins was retired in 1979. One of the original cars is now part of the Museum at ADPS Headquarters.

==International markets==
American Motors was active in foreign markets via exports of complete cars as well as joint ventures and partner companies to assemble knock-down versions of its vehicles.

===Australia===

Australian Motor Industries (AMI) assembled right hand drive versions of both the first- and second-generation Javelin models in Victoria, Australia, from Knock-down kits. The right-hand drive dash, the interior, and soft trim, as well as other components, were locally manufactured and differed from the U.S. originals. The cars were marketed under the historic Rambler name. The AMI Rambler Javelins were the only American &quot;muscle cars&quot; of that era to be sold new in Australia. The Australian Javelins came with top trim and features that included the V8 engine, three-speed &quot;Shift Command&quot; automatic transmission, and &quot;Twin Grip&quot; limited-slip rear differential. They were more expensive, had more power, and provided more luxury than the contemporary Holden Monaro.

The first generation Javelin sold for AU$7,495 in comparison to rival models, the Holden HK Monaro GTS, which sold for AU$3,790, and the Ford XT Falcon GT, which sold for AU$4,200. Sales were low, and AMI production ceased after 1972, with a total of 258 models built between 1968 and 1972.

From 1964, Rambler sales for New South Wales were managed by Sydney company Grenville Motors Pty Ltd, the State distributor of Rover and Land Rover. Grenville controlled a network of Sydney and country NSW dealers in direct communication with AMI. Australian-assembled AMC vehicles were otherwise sold in all States by independent distributors.

===France===
Renault had formerly assembled AMC vehicles until 1967. After Renault ceased production, the AMC Javelin was imported into France by Jacques Poch. They were also the official French importer-distributor of auto brands Škoda and Lada in Neuilly, and one of the two largest private importers of foreign automobiles in France. As with all export markets, the Javelin was marketed in France as &quot;Rambler.&quot;

===Germany===
American Motors had an agreement with the importer and distributor of Jaguar and Aston Martin cars, Peter Lindner of Frankfurt am Main, to be the exclusive importer of AMC cars into West Germany and offered seven models in the marketplace.

Additionally, Javelins were built for the European market. The car was displayed on the Karmann stand at the 1968 Paris Motor Show in October. The German coach builder, known for the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia and VW Beetle convertibles, assembled 280 complete knock down (CKD) Javelins between 1968 and 1970 that were marketed in Europe. This was a significant business relationship because the Javelin was a completely American-designed car that was made in Germany. The Javelins carried the 79-K model name and a 79-K diecast emblem on the C-pillars, with K representing Karmann and 79 was the AMC body style designation. The cars had Karmann serial numbers stamped on a metal plate attached to the firewall rather than AMC Vehicle identification numbers.

The &quot;Javelin 79-K&quot; could be ordered with the I6, 2-barrel, or 4-barrel V8 engines. Transmissions for the six were a three-speed manual on the floor or an optional automatic on the column, the 290 V8 had the standard manual or optional console-mounted automatic, while the 343 V8 came only with the center console automatic transmission. Thirteen cars were delivered with the 3-speed manual transmission. About 90% of the parts and components came in crates from the United States. The speedometers were in &quot;km/h&quot; and the headlights were European specification Karmann supplied the interior upholstery and paint. A choice of six colors was available: White, Cherry Red, Bahama Yellow, Pacific Blue, Bristol Grey, and Irish Green. At Karmann&#x27;s facility in Rheine, the cars were assembled, painted, and test-driven before shipment to customers.

===Mexico===
Vehículos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) assembled Javelins in Mexico under license and partial ownership (40% equity share) by AMC from 1968 through 1973. The VAM versions were equipped with different, locally made components, trim, and interiors compared to the equivalent AMC-made models. The Mexican-built Javelins came in only one version. They had more standard equipment compared to U.S. and Canadian models. The Javelin was the first VAM model not to carry the Rambler name for Mexico, AMC&#x27;s case being the Marlin and Ambassador models in 1966.

====1968====
The Javelin was not introduced in Mexico by VAM until 1 April 1968, making the model a &quot;1968 and a half&quot; similar to the February 1968 debut of the two-seat AMX. The Javelin represented the third line within VAM&#x27;s product mix for the first time and the first regular production high-end sports-oriented model. It would eventually become the only AMC muscle car marketed in Mexico. Other AMC muscle cars were equivalents built by VAM or as special editions, such as the 1979 American 06/S taking the place of the 1971 Hornet SC/360, the 1972 Classic Brougham hardtop taking the place of the 1970 Rebel Machine, and the 1971 Matador Machine plus the 1969 Shelby Rambler Go Pack the place of the 1969 Hurst SC/Rambler. The Javelin introduced many firsts for VAM, such as a standard four-speed manual transmission and the option for the first time in a regular production model of a three-speed automatic transmission. These transmissions were available in the Javelin, and all came with floor-mounted shifters, just like the two-seater AMX. Cars with the automatic included a center console with a locking compartment and power drum brakes at no extra cost.

The 1968 VAM Javelin featured the , 8.5:1 compression ratio I6 engine with a two-barrel Carter WCD carburetor, a 3.54:1 rear differential gear ratio, 12-inch heavy-duty clutch, manual four-wheel drum brakes, quick-ratio manual steering, electric wipers, electric washers, 8,000 RPM tachometer, 200 km/h speedometer, AM radio, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, courtesy lights, day-night rearview mirror, padded sun visors, two-point front seatbelts, low-back reclining bucket seats, rear ashtray, dual C-pillar-mounted dome lights, dual coat hooks, sports steering wheel, driver&#x27;s side remote mirror, side armrests, vinyl door panels with woodgrain accents, bright moldings on top of the doors and rocker panels plus hood and fender extension edges, wheel covers, 7.35x14 tires, protective side moldings, and front fender-mounted Javelin emblems.

The standard trim and features make the VAM Javelin equivalent to the U.S. and Canadian AMC Javelin SST. Factory options included power drum brakes with a manual transmission, power steering, heater, passenger&#x27;s side remote mirror, remote-controlled driver&#x27;s side mirror, custom sport wheels, and rear bumper guards. Dealer-installed options included side decals, light group, map pouches, vinyl roof, locking gas cap, license plate frames, mud flaps, AM/FM radio, front disk brakes, heavy-duty adjustable shocks, trunk lid rack, and many others.

A unique dealer-installed option was also VAM&#x27;s own &quot;Go Pack&quot;. This consisted of manual front disk brakes, heavy-duty suspension with front sway bar plus rear torsion and traction bars, aluminum four-barrel intake manifold with four-barrel Carter carburetor, headers with equal-length tubes and dual final outlets, dual exhausts, ported head with larger valves, and heavy-duty springs, 302-degree camshaft, Hurst linkage for the manual transmission, &quot;Rallye Pak&quot; auxiliary gauges on the dashboard (different from AMC&#x27;s original units), exclusive steering wheel, exclusive dual remote mirrors, and exclusive turbine wheels. The performance upgrades of the Go Pack represented a 40% increase in engine output, making the VAM Javelin far more competitive against its V8 rivals from &quot;Ford de México&quot;, &quot;General Motors de México&quot;, and Automex (&quot;Chrysler de México&quot;).

Despite lacking a V8 engine, the VAM Javelin succeeded in sales and public opinion.

====1969====
The 1969 VAM Javelins included the previously optional heater as standard, the foot pedals added bright trim, the accelerator was changed into a firewall-mounted unit, a grab strap was added on the passenger&#x27;s side dashboard above the glove box, and the center cover with the radio speaker grid changed into a woodgrain version. A unique aspect of the 1969 Javelin is that it kept the same gauge configuration as the 1968 models in contrast to AMC&#x27;s modifications to the Javelin (and AMX) instrument panel for 1969 with a larger 8,000 RPM tach on the right pod, leaving the smaller left pod exclusive for the clock and all gauges being placed closer to the driver. However, like under AMC, in the mid-year VAM introduced the hooded surround for the tach and speedometer. The VAM Javelins exterior now included a bright trim package with new moldings starting at the corners of the taillights running on the sides to the lower rear corner of the side glass and drip rails, plus all around the rear glass and top edge of the C-pillars making the Javelins look more luxurious. Despite these accessories being factory issue, a vinyl roof cover was only available at a dealer level. The front fender emblems were relocated to each C-pillar&#x27;s base and accompanied by red-white-blue bull&#x27;s eye emblems. A third Javelin emblem was mounted near the lower right corner of the grille accompanied by its respective bull&#x27;s eye unit. The 1969 model year was also VAM&#x27;s first self-engineered engine, the , 9.5:1 compression ratio I6 engine with a two-barrel Carter WCD carburetor and a new VAM-engineered 266-degree camshaft in both standard and Go Pack versions. This new engine was a major improvement for the Javelin as a performance model compared to its first year.

====1970====
The 1970 VAM Javelin followed the AMC redesign. The VAM versions included the same features as their AMC counterparts, but with new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. Two hood designs were available: a center bulge with two simulated air intakes or a smoother version with two rectangular stripped trim pieces. The functional Ram Air system was unavailable because VAM Javelins did not offer V8 engines.

Changes to the interior included a new collapsible steering column with a built-in ignition switch, it incorporated a safety and anti-theft lock not just reduced to the steering wheel but also extending to both shifters. It required the levers to be placed in either Reverse (manual) or Park (automatic) positions for the switch to be able to turn into the lock position and allow the driver to retrieve the key. Also new were a two-arm sports steering wheel with three simulated spokes and a central bulls-eye emblem. The dashboard and center console were redesigned, including full-width woodgrain trim and the three-pod instrumentation. Despite this change in dashboard design, the three gauges remained unchanged from the previous two years. A new shifter and console design were featured with the automatic transmission, and the door panels were revised.

A new front suspension design featured dual control arms and ball joints. All VAM Javelins with four-speed manual transmissions now included a Hurst linkage as factory-installed equipment. It was previously available only with the optional Go Pack package and separately in certain dealerships. A mid-year change replaced the imported Borg-Warner T10 manual transmission with the Querétaro-produced TREMEC (Transmisiones y Equipos Mecánicos) 170-F four-speed model to comply with domestic content requirements.

====1971====
The year 1971 represented a complete turnaround for VAM. The new Camioneta Rambler American based on the Hornet Sportabout was introduced, the Rambler Classic obtained all features of AMC&#x27;s new Matador, and the second-generation Javelin was introduced.

On the outside, the VAM Javelin was the same as its redesigned AMC counterpart except for the road wheels, and there were no factory stripes and decals. A unique feature of the second-generation VAM Javelin were round porthole opera windows mounted on the C-pillars installed by some VAM dealerships with or without vinyl roofs.

The standard engine was the new , 9.5:1 compression ratio I6 engine with Carter ABD two-barrel carburetor. It was VAM&#x27;s second self-engineered engine, taking the Javelin up to the performance levels of its V8 competition. The Go Pack version of this engine was the most powerful. Two &quot;4.6&quot; emblems on the front fenders identified the new engine. The only other change was a 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for cars with automatic transmissions.

The interior featured all-new, non-reclining high-back bucket seats with embossed &quot;J&quot; emblems on the built-in headrests and on the center of the rear seatback. The dashboard included woodgrain overlays, and the instrument cluster differed from the AMC Javelins like all previous models. The right pod housed a clock and tachometer hybrid with the same design and appearance as the US Rallye Pak units, except that it was designed for six-cylinder engines. The center pod had a 240 km/h speedometer, a range that puts it on par as an equivalent to AMC&#x27;s 140 mph unit of the Rallye Pak, but the colors, graphics, and typography of the dial were the same as the standard gauges. This created a high contrast between the speedometer and the clock/tack hybrid. The pod on the left contained fuel and water temperature gauges only with no presence or availability of the US Rallye Pak ammeter and oil pressure gauges. Warning lights were for oil pressure, electrical system and brakes. Following the AMC Javelins, the VAM versions featured a single dome light at the center of the headliner and a new brake pedal design for cars with automatic transmissions.

====1972====
All the quality and engineering upgrades and revisions incorporated into AMC cars for 1972 were also present in the vehicles built in Mexico. The 1972 VAM Javelin saw considerable improvements in both performance and sportiness. Heavy-duty suspension (stronger springs and shocks along with the front sway bar) became standard equipment. Front disk brakes replaced the previous drums as factory issue and were power-assisted regardless of transmission. The power steering system became standard in units ordered with the automatic transmission. Cars equipped with the four-speed manual transmission changed to a 3.31:1 rear ratio. The &quot;Shift-Command&quot; Borg-Warner automatic transmissions were replaced by the new &quot;Torque Command&quot; Chrysler-built A998 TorqueFlite.

The 1972 VAM Javelins followed the AMC versions&#x27; rectangular grid front grille and the matching chromed taillamp overlay. For the first time, the exterior included factory stripe designs. The interior saw new seat patterns and a new three-spoke sports steering wheel with an &quot;American Motors&quot; logo on the transparent plastic cap of the horn button. A new steering column design with a built-in safety lever to engage the steering lock came, while the mechanism linking the shifter to the ignition switch was discontinued.

====1973====
For the 1973 model year, the VAM Javelin received mostly cosmetic changes. The car incorporated the new smaller rectangular grille design with integrated rectangular parking lights and mesh grating, the hollow vents under the front of the fenders obtained a black cover, and the &quot;TV screen&quot; taillight design with a more prominent central bull&#x27;s eye emblem between them. The interior saw new original seat patterns and for the first time in the model a center console for the four-speed manual transmission. Mechanically, the car was the same as the year before except for a new engine head design with independent rockers instead of the flute-type shaft and the power steering system made standard equipment for units with the manual transmission. Except for the lack of intake porting, these heads were the same units used in the Go Pack engines. These were the most potent VAM Javelins ever made in stock condition until that point. Like the Mexican originals not offering a Ram Air system, the second-generation Javelins were not available with cowl induction hoods as the 1974 AMC Javelins in any form. This year&#x27;s sales went down from the previous seasons, and the beginning of engine emission certification scheduled by the Mexican government the following year would take a toll on all high-compression gasoline engines produced in the country. This started to threaten the Javelin and all performance cars made in Mexico, which took a toll on the sales. Moreover, the need to add the smaller Gremlin model and the company&#x27;s perception that the upcoming new Matador coupe model could take the position as the image builder and enthusiast generator of the marque prompted VAM to discontinue the Javelin at the end of the 1973 model year production, one year before AMC&#x27;s production of the Javelin ended in the U.S.

=== Philippines ===
The Philippines was almost exclusively an American car market until 1941. The post-WWII years saw an influx of European cars entering the market. Despite a saturation of international brands, American Motors Corporation established a presence, and the Rambler Classic and Rambler American were locally assembled in the Philippines by Luzon Machineries, Rizal Avenue, Manila.

Luzon Machineries later assembled the 1968 through 1970 AMC Javelins. The Javelin was one of only two &quot;pony cars&quot; available in the Philippines, the other being the Chevrolet Camaro. The Philippine-assembled Javelin came only with AMC&#x27;s I6 engines due to the national tax restrictions.

In 1970, Luzon Machineries began to end passenger vehicle manufacturing, and only a dozen Javelins were assembled during the final year.

=== Switzerland ===
Beginning in 1970, Zurich automotive importer J.H Heller AG began importing the AMC Javelin, the Gremlin, and later the Pacer models. Swiss market vehicles were shipped from AMC&#x27;s Canadian plant.

===United Kingdom===
American Motors exported factory right-hand-drive vehicles to the United Kingdom, built at the Brampton plant in Ontario, Canada. These were marketed in the United Kingdom by Rambler Motors (A.M.C.) Ltd in Chiswick, West London. The Chiswick plant had previously assembled Hudson, Essex, and Terraplane vehicles since 1926 and had become a subsidiary of AMC in 1961, after that importing complete AMC vehicles. The Chiswick depot also became the Rambler parts center for the United Kingdom, Europe, and the Middle East. They also kept parts for Hudson and the English-built Austin Metropolitan.

For 1968, the U.K market Javelin was available only in left-hand-drive. From 1969 U.K-market Javelins were exported in factory right-hand-drive.

=== Venezuela ===
Constructora Venezolana de Vehículos C.A. of Venezuela was a subsidiary of AMC beginning in 1967. The firm assembled AMC Javelins from 1968 until 1974 in its Caracas, Venezuela facility.

The Venezuelan 1968 Javelin was equipped with the V8 engine. In 1969, it came with the with automatic or four-speed manual transmission. 

For the 1972–1974 (second-generation) Javelins, the only powertrain available for the Venezuelan market was AMC&#x27;s with a 4-barrel carburetor coupled to the Chrysler automatic transmission.

==Legacy==
The introduction of the Javelin was an &quot;image Buster&quot; and evidence of AMC at work &quot;reinventing itself — from a maker of small, plain economy cars to a full-line automobile manufacturer with a complete range of vehicles.&quot; &quot;Over the following six years, the eclectic and polarizing AMC Javelin would go down as one of the most underrated and often underappreciated performance cars in American history.&quot;

The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; auto editor Dan Jedlicka wrote that the Javelin, which he describes as &quot;beautifully sculpted&quot; and &quot;one of the best-looking cars of the 1960s&quot;, is &quot;finally gaining the respect of collectors, along with higher prices.&quot; The first generation Javelin has also been described as a &quot;fun and affordable American classic with a rich racing pedigree and style that will always stand out from the omnipresent packs of Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler pony cars.&quot; The AMC Javelin does not command the high prices of some other muscle and pony cars. Still, it offers collectors the same style and spirit. The Javelin is among the &quot;highly prized&quot; models among AMC fans. Moreover, in its day, the Javelin sold in respectable numbers, regularly outselling the Plymouth Barracuda and Dodge Challenger popular with collectors today.

The Antique Automobile Club of America (AACA) divides the &quot;muscle&quot; AMC Javelins into two categories: Class 36-e for 1968 and 1969 Javelin base and SST models equipped from the factory with 4-barrel or larger V8 engines; and Class 36-j for the 1970 through 1974 Javelin, SST, and AMX models equipped from the factory with four-barrel or larger V8 engines. Javelins built with smaller engines compete in the regular AMC classes according to their respective decade of production.

According to estimates from the &quot;2006 Collector Car Price Guide&quot;, some of the desirable extras include the V8 engines, particularly the 390 and 401 versions, as well as the &quot;Go&quot; package and distinctive models, including original &quot;Big Bad&quot; paint cars. The 1970 Mark Donohue Javelin is highly desired, with factory original examples commanding price premiums. A fully documented Donohue Javelin scored the most points in the OE Certified judging and earned the 1999 Mopar Muscle-sponsored Best of Show award. The 1971 through 1974 AMX versions also command higher prices, according to several collector price guides. The 1973 Trans Am Victory edition also adds a premium, according to several classic car appraisal listings. However, the distinguishing decal is readily available and has been added to many Javelins. The book &quot;Keith Martin&#x27;s Guide to Car Collecting&quot; describes the cars as providing &quot;style, power, nostalgia, and fun by venturing off the beaten path ... these overlooked cars offer great value&quot; and includes the 1971 through 1974 Javelins as one of &quot;nine muscle car sleepers.&quot;

Both first- and second-generation Javelins have been modified for more speed, handling, or acceleration. Some have been built as race-legal or race-ready tribute cars or replicas made to resemble AMC&#x27;s factory-backed Trans-Am racers.

There are active AMC automobile clubs, including owners interested in dragstrip and racing in vintage events, such as the National American Motors Drivers &amp; Racers Association (NAMDRA). The Javelin shared numerous mechanical, body, and trim parts with other AMC models, and there are vendors specializing at AMC shows and swap meets specializing in new old stock (NOS) as well as reproduction components.

A customized 1972 AMC Javelin AMX powered by a &quot;Hellcat&quot; Hemi was prepared for the 2017 Specialty Equipment Market Association SEMA show. The cusomizing company owners had known about a Javelin in their hometown for many years and finally acquired it for this project. The wheelbase was extended by placing the front wheels forward and adding a new carbon fiber front fenders, hood, and grille. The engine is a 6.2-liter Hemi Mopar fitted with a Whipple 4.5-liter supercharger and tuned to Wegner Motorsports to produce . The car was built for Prestone (maker of antifreeze and other fluids) and is called &quot;Defiant&quot;.

<text>In music, a solo () is a piece or a section of a piece played or sung featuring a single performer, who may be performing completely alone or supported by an accompanying instrument such as a piano or organ, a continuo group (in Baroque music), or the rest of a choir, orchestra, band, or other ensemble. Performing a solo is &quot;to solo&quot;, and the performer is known as a &quot;soloist&quot;.

The plural is soli or the anglicised form solos. In some contexts these are interchangeable, but &quot;soli&quot; tends to be restricted to classical music, and mostly either the solo performers or the solo passages in a single piece. Furthermore, the word &quot;soli&quot; can be used to refer to a small number of simultaneous parts assigned to single players in an orchestral composition. In the Baroque concerto grosso, the term for such a group of soloists was &quot;concertino&quot;.

An instrumental solo is often used in popular music during a break or bridge to add interest and variety to a part of the song without lyrics.

==History==
===18th century===
In the Baroque and Classical periods, the word &quot;solo&quot; was virtually equivalent to &quot;sonata&quot;, and could refer either to a piece for one melody instrument with (continuo) accompaniment, or to a sonata for an unaccompanied melody instrument, such as Johann Sebastian Bach’s sonatas for violin alone.

<doc id="377237" wikidata="Q6900949" url="?curid=377237" title="Monks Risborough">
<text>Monks Risborough is a village and ecclesiastical parish in the civil parish of Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, England, lying between Princes Risborough and Great Kimble. The village lies at the foot of the northern scarp of the Chiltern Hills. It is south of the county town of Aylesbury and north of High Wycombe, on the A4010 road.

Until 1934 Monks Risborough was also a separate civil parish, but it now forms part of the much enlarged civil parish of Princes Risborough, with the exception of Meadle and Owlswick, which are both now in the civil parish of Longwick-cum-Ilmer.

The boundaries of the ecclesiastical parish of Monks Risborough are almost the same as the former Manor of Monks Risborough and of the original estate laid out in the 8th or 9th century. References to the &#x27;parish&#x27; are therefore to the area covered by the ecclesiastical parish unless otherwise stated.

The ecclesiastical parish of Monks Risborough includes the hamlets of Meadle, Owlswick, Askett, Cadsden and Whiteleaf.

==Description==
The parish is long and narrow. It is almost in length, from Owlswick in the north to Monkton Farm on the outskirts of Speen in the south; but it is only one and a quarter miles wide at the widest part (at Meadle) and barely four hundred yards at the narrowest parts (at Green Hailey and in Monkton Wood). Like the neighbouring Chiltern &#x27;strip parishes&#x27; the estate was originally laid out so as to include different types of land, fertile land below the scarp of the Chiltern Hills, a section of the scarp itself and grazing or woods above it.

At the foot of the scarp, where there are springs, is the village of Monks Risborough, with the church, and also Askett and Cadsden, nearer to Aylesbury on either side of the main road. Meadle and Owlswick lie further north. Whiteleaf is halfway up the slope on the south side of the Aylesbury Road and the parish continues further to the south above the scarp along the high land through Green Hailey to Redland End and Monkton Wood and Farm.

Approximate heights above sea level are 85 m (279 ft) at Meadle and Owlswick, 100 m (328 ft) by the Church, 247 m (810 ft) at Green Hailey, where there is a water tower, and 200 m (656 ft) at Monkton Farm near Speen.

==The name==
The name &#x27;Risborough&#x27; meant &#x27;brushwood-covered hills&#x27; and comes from two Old English words: &quot;hrisen&quot;, which was an adjective meaning brushwood-covered derived from &quot;hris&quot; meaning brushwood or scrub, and &quot;beorg&quot; which meant hill. The plural forms are &quot;hrisenan beorgas&quot;. The spelling in the various documents where the name is found is, as usual, very variable. In the 10th and 11th centuries it had the following forms:
*&quot;easteran hrisanbyrge&quot; (East Risborough)
*&quot;risenbeorgas&quot;
*&quot;hrisebyrgan be cilternes efese&quot; (brushwood-covered hills by Chiltern eaves)
*&quot;risebergh&quot; (in the Domesday Book of 1086).
In the 13th century it appears as &quot;parva risenburgh&quot; (Little Risborough)
and in 1346, in the Patent Rolls, for the first time as &quot;monekenrisbourgh&quot;
and again in 1392 as &quot;munken ryseberg&quot;.

(The prefix &#x27;Monks&#x27; is explained under History below).

==History==
An estate with boundaries corresponding closely to the present ecclesiastical parish of Monks Risborough was granted to some unknown person by the King of Mercia in the 8th or 9th century. The details are unknown because the title documents (the &quot;landbook&quot;) were destroyed by fire shortly before 903. The Mercian Witan then agreed that a confirmatory charter should be granted and this was executed in 903. This charter, written in Latin, confirmed that the estate had been given by one Athulf to his daughter Aethelgyth. A description in Anglo-Saxon of the boundaries of the estate was endorsed on the charter. There is a 10th-century copy of the document in the British Library.

Then, at some date between 903 and 994, the estate was given to Christ Church Cathedral at Canterbury and in 994 it was held by Sigeric, who was then the Archbishop of Canterbury. In that year marauders from Scandinavia ravaged Kent and threatened to burn down Canterbury Cathedral unless they were bought off. The Archbishop had insufficient money and sent to Aescwig, Bishop of Dorchester-on-Thames to ask him for a loan. He offered the estate at East Risborough (as it was then described) as security. Money was sent, the cathedral was saved and East Risborough was transferred to Aescwig in the presence of the King and Witan, who at the same time freed the estate from all secular burdens except the obligation for military service and for contributions to bridges and fortresses. At a date between 994 and 1002 Aescwig conveyed the estate back to Canterbury, where Aelfric was now Archbishop after the death of Sigeric. Aelfric in turn died in 1005 and by his will he left his interest in East Risborough to Christ Church Priory, Canterbury. Thereafter it was not owned by the Archbishop but by the monks of the Priory as a community, represented by their Prior – hence &quot;Monks&quot; Risborough – and, even after the Norman Conquest, it continued to enjoy the freedom from liabilities granted in 994.

At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086 the tenant-in-chief of the manor was Archbishop Lanfranc, a stern and very capable man, rivalling the King himself in statesmanship, who had been appointed to the see of Canterbury in 1070 after the Conquest. He held it by frankalmoin. Domesday Book records that the manor was assessed at 30 hides and that there was land there for 14 ploughs. Of these the lord&#x27;s demesne accounted for 16 hides and 2 ploughs. There were 32 villeins and 8 cottagers and they had 12 ploughs. There were also 4 slaves. These would be only the male heads of families (except for slaves who may have been counted as individuals) and the total has to be multiplied by an arbitrary figure (4 or 5 is usual) for an estimate of the total including women and children. We can therefore assume that the total population was something less than 200 in 1086. There was meadow for 4 plough teams and woodland sufficient for 300 pigs. The value was stated to be £16 in 1086 and also in the time of Edward the Confessor but only £5 immediately after the conquest in 1066. The entry concludes &quot;Asgar the Constable held this manor from Christ Church Canterbury before 1066 on condition that it could not be separated from the Church&quot;.

The Manor was then part (with Bledlow, Horsenden and Princes Risborough) of the Hundred of Risborough. This was one of the Three Hundreds of Aylesbury, which by the 14th century were consolidated into the Hundred of Aylesbury.

In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 827. On 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished and merged with Princes Risborough, part also went to form Longwick cum Ilmer and Great and Little Hampden.

In 1535, immediately before the dissolution of the monasteries, King Henry VIII, acting by Thomas Cromwell, ordered a valuation to be made of all the ecclesiastical property in England. The manor of Monks Risborough was included in this valuation under the heading &quot;Properties of the Church of Christ at Canterbury&quot;. The Manor, which was let out at a rent by the Priory, was shown as worth the &#x27;farm&#x27; or rent of £9 a year. The mills were shown separately (£25.8s.11d a year), as were sales from the woods (about 60s) and &#x27;other perquisites&#x27; (12s). The total annual value, after making allowable deductions, was returned at £34.11s.7d. The church was valued separately from the manor and the Rectory was not shown as property of the Priory. It was shown separately as part of the Deanery of Risborough within the Diocese of Lincoln but within the exempt jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury and worth £30 a year.

Christ Church Priory was finally dissolved in 1539 and the manor of Monks Risborough was put up for sale by the Royal Commissioners in 1541. It changed hands on sale on several subsequent occasions until it became vested in the Earl of Buckinghamshire in the 18th or early 19th Century.

Buckinghamshire was transferred from Lincoln to the Diocese of Oxford in 1837 and the Bishop of Oxford then became patron of the living.

==Enclosure of the parish==
Monks Risborough resisted the pressure to enclose the common lands and open fields and to do away with rights of common until a later date than most places, but a local Act of Parliament was eventually obtained in 1830 (11 Geo. 4) entitled &#x27;An Act for inclosing lands in the Parish of Monks Risborough in the County of Buckingham&#x27;. Royal assent was granted on 29 May 1830 and the first meeting of the three commissioners appointed to investigate the matter and make the Award was held in the Cross Keys Inn at Princes Risborough on 17 June 1830. There seems to have been opposition, because the award was not completed until 23 September 1839. It is said that meetings to oppose the enclosure were held in the Three Crowns Inn at Askett. Eventually the opposition was overcome and all the former common lands were allotted to individual parishioners. The full details, with a large scale map of the parish as it then was, are set out in the Award.

A number of fields were allotted to the rector in lieu of tithe, which then ceased to be payable (except in respect of woodlands). Other fields were allotted for the benefit of the poor, who lost their rights over the common lands such as the right to gather wood in certain woodlands. Originally the rents of these fields were used to buy coal. The fields are now vested in the Trustees of Monks Risborough Parochial Charities and they have a wider discretion as to the charitable purposes for which the income can be applied. All the woodlands in the parish were allotted to the Lord of the Manor, the Earl of Buckinghamshire.

A field in a district then called Rumborough was allotted to be used for recreation; this is now the Monks Risborough cricket pitch.

The award also designated land for footpaths and roads, following the existing tracks as shown on the plans. Most footpaths were to be wide and most roads wide. These did not include the Aylesbury Road which was already a public highway and always referred to in the award as &#x27;the Turnpike Road&#x27;. Special provision was made about Whiteleaf Cross as mentioned below in the section on the cross.

==The parish in antiquity==
On Whiteleaf Hill, which extends above the hamlet of Whiteleaf to the top of the scarp at , is an oval Neolithic barrow (National Grid SP 822040), which was first excavated by Sir Lindsay Scott between 1934 and 1939, when the work was interrupted by the Second World War and the excavator died before he had had an opportunity to publish more than interim notes on his findings. A fuller report was published from his notes in 1954. The site was re-excavated from 2002 to 2006 by Oxford Archaeology (assisted by the Princes Risborough Countryside Group) and their report was published in 2007.
There was a single burial within the barrow, a middle aged man between 5&#x27;6&quot; and 5&#x27;9&quot; in height, with a long and narrow skull (a type found in the Neolithic period), badly worn teeth and arthritic joints. The remains appeared to have been placed between two large vertical posts, 1.2 metres apart. Pottery shards and animal bones were found at the core of the mound and the excavators suggest that these came from ceremonial feasting when the mound was built.

After the re-excavation the soil was replaced, following Sir Lindsay Scott&#x27;s plans and drawings, so that the appearance of the barrow now corresponds with that existing at the start of excavations in 1934.

Radio-carbon dating has shown that the death, the burial and the building of the mound probably all took place within the period 3,750–3,100 B.C., but at different times within that period. The ceremonial burial could have been 45–150 years after the death and the completion of the mound could be up to 200 years after that. Similar delays have been shown to have occurred at other sites.

The status of the individual and the actual nature of the events are unknown, but he must have been a man of significance in local society.

Two other supposed barrows were scheduled as Ancient Monuments but have now been shown by the same excavators not to be burial mounds. They are sited to the north of the oval barrow along the top of the hill. One is likely to have been the base of a windmill, probably in use for a relatively short time in the late 16th and early 17th century. The other is a natural mound, but many chipped flints were found there and it seems to have been a site where flints were obtained and partially worked (for finishing elsewhere) during the late neolithic period.

Just to the south of the oval barrow, crossing the path leading to the car park, another earthwork was investigated and was found to be a cross-ridge dyke about 140 m long across the southern end of the narrowest part of the ridge. Its date is uncertain, but the excavators considered that it might be a late Bronze Age boundary.

The ancient trackway known as the Icknield Way, which ran from the Wash to Wessex, passed through the parish. It here consisted of two separate tracks, the Upper Icknield Way and the Lower Icknield Way, supposedly for winter and summer use respectively, though Christopher Taylor suggests that the upper route follows the prehistoric track, while the lower route was a Roman road which followed the same general line but on flat land more suitable for Roman methods of road construction. The route of the Lower Icknield Way is now followed by the B4009, while the Upper Icknield Way is here still a muddy track, except where it passes through the hamlet of Whiteleaf

A section of the extensive earthwork known as Grim&#x27;s Ditch crosses the parish much further south (Map square SP 8203). This is thought to be an Iron Age boundary dyke.

==The church==

The parish church is dedicated to St Dunstan. The present building, which replaced an earlier church, dates mainly from the 14th and 15th centuries, restored and in part renewed by G.E. Street in 1863–64. It is built of flint and has a chancel, nave with two aisles, north transept and a square tower at the west end.

The nave arcades have octagonal piers and are of 14th-century date, the south aisle being earlier than the north. The transept may be earlier. However, the windows are all in the perpendicular style of the 15th century, except those in the south aisle, where the eastern window is modern but the windows in the south wall are 14th century. In the 15th century the roof was raised and the clerestory built. The old roof line can still be seen on the west wall of the nave. The present roof of the nave and south porch are 15th century, when the chancel was also rebuilt. The chancel roof is modern. The font is Norman, of the &#x27;Aylesbury&#x27; late 12th-century type, and presumably came from the earlier church. There is a 15th-century chancel screen, though without its original tracery, with crudely re-painted figures below. At the left side of the chancel arch is the opening for the door which led to the rood loft.
There are three monumental brasses in the church, two of the 15th century and the other undated. A random collection of 14th and 15th century stained glass has been put together in a window in the south aisle, including a small 14th century Madonna and child.
==Whiteleaf Cross==

Whiteleaf Hill, has a large cross with a triangular base cut into the chalk on the side of the hill, making an important landmark for miles around, known as Whiteleaf Cross. The date and origin of this cross are unknown. It was mentioned as an antiquity by Francis Wise in 1742, but no earlier reference has been found. The cross is not mentioned in any description of the area before 1700.

The Act for enclosing the common lands in the Parish (see above) specifically required that &quot;in order to preserve within the parish of Monks Risborough the ancient memorial or land mark there called White Cliffe Cross&quot; the Commissioners were to allot to the Lord of the Manor the cross itself and &quot;so much of the land immediately surrounding it as shall in the judgment of the Commissioners be necessary and sufficient for rendering the same conspicuous&quot; and that it should not be planted or enclosed and should for ever thereafter remain open. The Lord of the Manor was to be responsible to renew and repair it. In the event the Commissioners allotted of land for this purpose.

==Various buildings and places of interest==

===Still existing===

====Cottages====
There are picturesque cottages (some half-timbered) in Burton Lane in the old village and also in the hamlets of Askett and Whiteleaf. Most of the interiors have been modernised and in places two or more have been combined to make a larger house. They range from the late 16th to the early 18th century.

====Monks Risborough C of E Primary School====

On the Aylesbury Road to the west of the Parish is Monks Risborough C of E Primary School , first founded in 1855 as a National School
and expanded mid-20th century. The school teaches around 200 children aged 5 to 11.

====Pigeon House====
In the field (now a recreation ground) to the west of the church is a 16th-century pigeon house, where pigeons were bred for food. It has a curious northern doorway, which may have been brought from elsewhere. There are nesting places (&#x27;pigeon holes&#x27;) for 216 pigeons. In later years it formed part of Place Farm and was used as a shelter for cattle. At the end of the 20th century it was cleaned out, repaired and secured.

====Railway station====

The single track railway line from Princes Risborough to Aylesbury, was constructed in 1863 and converted from broad gauge to standard gauge in 1868, but there was no station at Monks Risborough until 1929. Monks Risborough railway station opened on 11 November 1929 as Monks Risborough and Whiteleaf Halt. It has been called Monks Risborough since 1974.

===Formerly existing===
====Gallows====

In the reign of Edward I, when the King was calling on his feudal tenants to show their title to rights which they claimed to exercise, the Prior of Christchurch, Canterbury claimed to be entitled to maintain at Monks Risborough a gallows, a tumbril and a pillory. The King&#x27;s counsel, objecting to the claim, said that there was no pillory at Monks Risborough. It is said that the Cadsden Road used to be known as Gallows Lane and the crossing of the Upper Icknield Way with Cadsden Road as Gallows Cross.

====Mills====

Domesday Book does not mention any mill at Monks Risborough, but there was certainly a mill there by the 14th century. During the 14th and 15th centuries the millward was several times brought before the manor court accused of overcharging. In 1535 the valuation, made prior to the dissolution of the monasteries, showed Monks Risborough (part of the property of the Priory of Christchurch, Canterbury) as having two mills, which brought in for the Priory an income of £25.8s.11d a year. In the 17th century the then Lord of the Manor owned two mills at his death, a watermill and a windmill on &#x27;Brokenhill&#x27; Excavations in 2002/06 found the site of a former windmill on the top of Whiteleaf Hill, thought to have been there in the 16th and 17th centuries. The watermill was at the house still called Mill House in Mill Lane. The map attached to the Inclosure Award of 1839 showed this property, described as &#x27;The Ham. Mill House&#x27;, with a millpond behind it and two fields marked as Mill Meadow and Mill Mead It is not known when it had ceased to be used as a working mill.

====Turnpike====

The road from Princes Risborough to Aylesbury (now the A4010 and called the Aylesbury Road) passes through the middle of the parish, and was made a Turnpike Road under the Aylesbury to West Wycombe Road Act 1795 (35 Geo. 3. c. 149), which created a turnpike trust to be responsible for the maintenance and improvement of the road from Ellesborough to West Wycombe There were barriers at places along the road where vehicles had to stop and tolls were collected. One toll gate and adjoining toll booth was in Monks Risborough near the boundary with Princes Risborough.

====Commercial buildings====

There have been no shops in the old village since the early 20th century: 

There was a butcher and slaughterhouse (now a dental practice) on the Aylesbury Road.
A blacksmith&#x27;s forge on the corner with Burton Lane (the house next to it is still called Forge Cottage), and a pub, the Nag&#x27;s Head (now a house) on the opposite corner.

On Burton Lane there was a saddler and harness maker (who also made ropes).

Eggleton&#x27;s Bakery (one of its set-ups was situated in Burton Lane) was a four-generation family business that baked the streets of Risborough since the early-nineteenth century. The list of baking cited in the book &#x27;The Voices of Princes Risborough&#x27; stated the Bakery would make: &quot;two-dozen doughnuts, fifteen-dozen currant buns, twenty-five dozen sausage rolls, seventy lardy cakes and two thousand loaves of bread.&quot; Eggleton&#x27;s products continued to be baked and sold in the general store or delivered from Burton Lane until 1961 when they moved to Bell Street in Princes Risborough but due to the rising competition of supermarkets they closed the business in 1965.

In the later 20th century Aston &amp; Full had a factory on the north side of Mill Lane. In the early 21st century the land was re-designated for residential use.

<text>HEC Montréal (; English: &quot;High Commercial Studies of Montreal&quot;) is a bilingual public business school located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Founded in 1907, HEC Montréal is the graduate business school of the Université de Montréal and is the first established school of management in Canada.

HEC Montréal offers undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate programs, including Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), Master of Science in Administration (MSc), Master of Management (MM), Master of Business Administration (MBA), and PhD in Administration, in addition to a joint Executive MBA program with McGill University.

== History ==
HEC Montréal was founded in 1907 by the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal. Its initial building in Viger Square is now called the Gilles Hocquart Building.

In 1988, a group of HEC students established Jeux du Commerce, where more than 1300 students from 14 universities in Eastern Canada gather annually for academic, social, and sports events. A similar competition has been established in Western Canada called JDC West.

As of 2021, the centenary of the HEC Montréal Alumni Association, the school had over 100,000 alumni.

== Buildings ==

=== The Decelles Campus: 1970–today ===
In 1970, Robert Bourassa inaugurated the Decelles building of HEC Montreal, also known as &quot;the School on the Mountain.&quot; The students sometimes use the expression &quot;Bunker&quot; to refer to it due to the use of concrete for the exterior façade and the absence of windows.

In 1976, the PhD program was proposed in collaboration with McGill University. The MSc program was created in the same year.

Under the presidency of Pierre Harvey, the 75th anniversary of the school was celebrated in 1982 with René Lévesque, then Premier of Quebec, in attendance. The 7th floor of the Decelles building was inaugurated on this occasion.

Between 2010 and 2012, the 3rd and 4th floors were renovated.

=== The Côte-Sainte-Catherine Campus: 1996–today ===

HEC Montréal&#x27;s main building was constructed in 1996 and has since won an award for &quot;institutional architecture.&quot; The building was designed by Dan Hanganu and Jodoin, Lamarre, Pratte, and Associates and is situated at 3000 Côte-Sainte-Catherine (Map), next to the Université-de-Montréal Metro Station. The former main building at 5255 Decelles (Map) is now used as a secondary building. The first building used by HEC Montréal was located in downtown Montreal but is no longer used by the school.

The trading floor of the school was inaugurated in 1997, and it was conceived to be usable in case the Montreal Stock Exchange ever had significant engineering problems. Now known as the Salle des marchés Financière Banque Nationale, it was renovated in 2007 to remain technologically current.

<doc id="377242" wikidata="Q122892" url="?curid=377242" title="Bromley">
<text>Bromley is a large town in Greater London, England, within the London Borough of Bromley. It is southeast of Charing Cross, and had an estimated population of 88,000 as of 2023.

Originally part of Kent, Bromley became a market town, chartered in 1158. Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development and the shift from an agrarian village to an urban town. As part of the growth of London&#x27;s conurbation in the 20th century, Bromley Town significantly increased in population and was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1903 and became part of the London Borough of Bromley in 1965. Bromley today forms a major retail and commercial centre. It is identified in the London Plan as one of the 13 metropolitan centres of Greater London.

==History==
Bromley is first recorded in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 862 as &quot;Bromleag&quot; and means &#x27;woodland clearing where broom grows&#x27;. It shares this Old English etymology with Great Bromley in eastern Essex, but not with the Bromley in the East End of London.

The history of Bromley is closely connected with the See of Rochester. In AD 862 Ethelbert, the King of Kent, granted land to form the Manor of Bromley. In 1185 Bromley Palace was built by Gilbert Glanvill, Bishop of Rochester. Pilgrims came to the town to visit St. Blaise&#x27;s Well. The Palace was held by the Bishops until 1845, when Coles Child, a wealthy local merchant and philanthropist, purchased Bromley Palace and became lord of the manor. The town was an important coaching stop on the way to Hastings from London, and the now defunct Royal Bell Hotel (just off Market Square) is referred to in Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. It was a quiet rural village until the arrival of the railway in 1858 in Shortlands, which led to rapid growth, and outlying suburban districts such as Bickley (which later overflowed into Bromley Common) were developed to accommodate those wishing to live so conveniently close to London.

Bromley, also known as &quot;Bromley St Peter and St Paul&quot;, formed an ancient parish in the Bromley and Beckenham hundred and the Sutton-at-Hone lathe of Kent. In 1840 it became part of the expanded Metropolitan Police District. The parish adopted the Local Government Act 1858 and a local board was formed in 1867. The board was reconstituted as Bromley Urban District Council in 1894 and the parish became Bromley Urban District. It formed part of the London Traffic Area from 1924 and the London Passenger Transport Area from 1933. In 1934, as part of a county review order, the borough was expanded by taking in from the disbanded Bromley Rural District; an area including parts of the parishes of Farnborough, Hayes, Keston and West Wickham. Bromley became part of the newly created Greater London in 1965, in the new London Borough of Bromley.

==Governance==

Bromley forms part of the Bromley and Biggin Hill Parliament constituency. The current MP is Peter Fortune. Thomas Turrell is the London Assembly member for the Bexley and Bromley constituency, in which the town is located. This post was previously held by Fortune.

Bromley&#x27;s most prominent MP was the former Conservative prime minister, Harold Macmillan.

Bromley High Street is also the location for the Bromley Charter Market, which runs on a Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. King John granted a charter for the Market to be held every Tuesday in 1205, with Henry VI revising this charter to every Thursday in 1447. The Market sells food and confectionery items, clothing and other goods like jewellery.

In another &quot;Monty Python&quot; sketch, it was stated that all seven continents are visible from the top of the Kentish Times building in Bromley.

The Bromley Contingent was the name given to the entourage that followed the Sex Pistols and helped popularise the punk movement. It was so called because many of its members were from Bromley, some of whom later became famous as musicians in their own right, like Siouxsie Sioux and Billy Idol.

The 2018 humorous film, &quot;The Bromley Boys&quot; is set in Bromley and surroundings in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Based on a real-life memoir by Dave Roberts about following Bromley F.C., it includes many scenes filmed locally, although Crockenhill F.C. was used as a substitute for the Hayes Lane stadium.

Guitarist Billy Jenkins, born in Bromley, released an album titled &quot;Sounds like Bromley&quot; in 1982 and another in 1997 titled &quot;Still Sounds Like Bromley&quot;.

The parish church of St Peter and St Paul stands on Church Road. It was largely destroyed by German bombing on 16 April 1941 and rebuilt in the 1950s incorporating the medieval tower and reusing much of the flint and fragments of the original stone building. The most noteworthy historic building is Bromley College, London Road. The central public open spaces are; Queen&#x27;s Gardens, Martin&#x27;s Hill, Church House Gardens, Library Gardens and College Green.
Another parish church in Bromley is St Mark&#x27;s, which stands on Westmoreland Road. The present church is the third. The first was built as a temporary iron church in 1884 to cope with Bromley&#x27;s growing population, on land slightly to the east of the present church, donated by a local man Eley Soames. The road name St Mark&#x27;s Road preserves the rough location of the former site.

The second church was built in brick and stone on the present site, and designed by Evelyn Hellicar, son of the then vicar of St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s. It was completed in 1898 in the Perpendicular Gothic style and consecrated by William Walsh, Bishop of Dover, on 22 October that year. The tower, though, was not completed until 1904. Like St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s, St Mark&#x27;s was heavily damaged in the London Blitz of 1941. Only the tower survived intact.

On 3 June 1952, the Duchess of Kent laid the foundation stone of the present church, which was designed by T W G Grant and built by David Nye. Besides the tower, other parts of the fabric of the original church were used in the rebuilding. Inside there are some interesting monuments: to Samuel Ajayi Crowther, John Cole Patteson and Vedanayagam Samuel Azariah, who were all bishops in the Commonwealth.

The East Street drill hall was completed in 1872.

==Notable residents==

Hughroy Currie

Based in London, Currie had his first professional fight in February 1981, a win over Mick Chmilowskyi. After an undistinguished start to his professional career in which he won only three of his first eight fights, a run of five straight wins led to a challenge for the Southern Area title against Funso Banjo; Banjo won on points over ten rounds.

Currie then travelled to the United States where he won both his fights, and in September 1985 he fought Banjo once again, this time for the British heavyweight title after David Pearce was forced to vacate; Pearce had KO&#x27;d Currie in a British amateur bout and Currie stated he was relieved not to face Pearce. Currie won a 12-round points decision against Banjo to become British champion. His next fight was an eliminator for the Commonwealth title against Proud Kilimanjaro, which he won over 10 rounds. He lost his British title at the first defence to Horace Notice in April 1986, Notice winning by a 6th-round TKO. Currie won four of his next 5 fights, including a 2nd-round knockout of Glenn McCrory, leading to another shot at the then vacant British title against Gary Mason; Mason won by a fourth-round knockout.

Currie then fought Derek Williams in December 1989 for both the Commonwealth title and the vacant EBU European title; Williams won by a first-round TKO. That proved to be Currie&#x27;s final fight and he retired from boxing. 

=== H. G. Wells ===
Author H. G. Wells was born in Bromley on 21 September 1866, to Sarah and Joseph Wells; his father was the founder of the Bromley Cricket Club and the proprietor of a shop that sold cricket equipment. Wells spent the first 13 years of his life in Bromley. From 1874 to 1879 he attended Tomas Morley&#x27;s Bromley Academy, at 74 High Street. There was a &#x27;H. G. Wells Centre&#x27; in Masons Hill near the southern end of the High Street which housed the Bromley Labour Club (the building was demolished in 2017). In August 2005, the wall honouring Wells in Market Square was repainted; the current wall painting features a rich green background with the same Wells reference and the evolutionary sequence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; featured in &quot;Origin of Species&quot; by Charles Darwin, a former resident of nearby Downe Village.

Wells wrote about Bromley in an early unsigned article in the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; in which he expressed satisfaction that he had been born in an earlier, more rural Bromley. A blue plaque marks Wells&#x27; birthplace in Market Square, on the wall of what is now a Primark store. A marble plaque appears above the door of 8 South Street, the location of Mrs Knott&#x27;s Dame school where &quot;Bertie&quot;, as he was called as a child, learned to read and write. H. G. Wells featured Bromley in two of his novels: &quot;The War in the Air&quot; (which refers to Bromley as Bunhill) and &quot;The New Machiavelli&quot; (in which Bromley is referred to as Bromstead).

However, H. G. Wells refused the offered freedom of the town, stating:

&quot;Bromley has not been particularly gracious to me nor I to Bromley and I don&#x27;t think I want to add the freedom of Bromley to the freedom of the City of London and the freedom of the City of Brussels – both of which I have.&quot;

He described Bromley in one of his novels as a &quot;morbid sprawl of population&quot;.

<text>Solenopsis invicta, the fire ant, or red imported fire ant (RIFA), is a species of ant native to South America. A member of the genus &quot;Solenopsis&quot; in the subfamily Myrmicinae, it was described by Swiss entomologist Felix Santschi as a variant of &quot;S. saevissima&quot; in 1916. Its current specific name &quot;invicta&quot; was given to the ant in 1972 as a separate species. However, the variant and species were the same ant, and the name was preserved due to its wide use. Though South American in origin, the red imported fire ant has been accidentally introduced in Australia, New Zealand, several Asian and Caribbean countries, Europe and the United States. The red imported fire ant is polymorphic, as workers appear in different shapes and sizes. The ant&#x27;s colours are red and somewhat yellowish with a brown or black gaster, but males are completely black. Red imported fire ants are dominant in altered areas and live in a wide variety of habitats. They can be found in rainforests, disturbed areas, deserts, grasslands, alongside roads and buildings, and in electrical equipment. Colonies form large mounds constructed from soil with no visible entrances because foraging tunnels are built and workers emerge far away from the nest.

These ants exhibit a wide variety of behaviours, such as building rafts when they sense that water levels are rising. They also show necrophoric behaviour, where nestmates discard scraps or dead ants on refuse piles outside the nest. Foraging takes place on warm or hot days, although they may remain outside at night. Workers communicate by a series of semiochemicals and pheromones, which are used for recruitment, foraging, and defence. They are omnivores and eat dead mammals, arthropods, insects, seeds, and sweet substances such as honeydew from hemipteran insects with which they have developed relationships. Predators include arachnids, birds, and many insects including other ants, dragonflies, earwigs, and beetles. The ant is a host to parasites and to a number of pathogens, nematodes, and viruses, which have been viewed as potential biological control agents. Nuptial flight occurs during the warm seasons, and the alates may mate for as long as 30 minutes. Colony founding can be done by a single queen or a group of queens, which later contest for dominance once the first workers emerge. Workers can live for several months, while queens can live for years; colony numbers can vary from 100,000 to 250,000 individuals. Two forms of society in the red imported fire ant exist: polygynous colonies (nests with multiple queens) and monogynous colonies (nests with one queen).

Venom plays an important role in the ant&#x27;s life, as it is used to capture prey or for defence. About 95% of the venom consists of water-insoluble piperidine alkaloids known as solenopsins, with the rest comprising a mixture of toxic proteins that can be particularly potent in sensitive humans; the name fire ant is derived from the burning sensation caused by their sting. More than 14 million people are stung by them in the United States annually, where many are expected to develop allergies to the venom. Most victims experience intense burning and swelling, followed by the formation of sterile pustules, which may remain for several days. However, 0.6% to 6.0% of people may suffer from anaphylaxis, which can be fatal if left untreated. Common symptoms include dizziness, chest pain, nausea, severe sweating, low blood pressure, loss of breath, and slurred speech. More than 80 deaths have been recorded from red imported fire ant attacks. Treatment depends on the symptoms; those who only experience pain and pustule formation require no medical attention, but those who suffer from anaphylaxis are given adrenaline. Whole body extract immunotherapy is used to treat victims and is regarded as highly effective.

The ant is viewed as a notorious pest, causing billions of dollars in damage annually and impacting wildlife. The ants thrive in urban areas, so their presence may deter outdoor activities. Nests can be built under structures such as pavements and foundations, which may cause structural problems, or cause them to collapse. Not only can they damage or destroy structures, but red imported fire ants also can damage equipment and infrastructure and impact business, land, and property values. In agriculture, they can damage crops and machinery, and threaten pastures. They are known to invade a wide variety of crops, and mounds built on farmland may prevent harvesting. They also pose a threat to animals and livestock, capable of inflicting serious injury or killing them, especially young, weak, or sick animals. Despite this, they may be beneficial because they consume common pest insects on crops. Common methods of controlling these ants include baiting and fumigation; other methods may be ineffective or dangerous. Due to its notoriety and importance, the ant has become one of the most studied insects on the planet, even rivalling the western honey bee (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;).

==Etymology and common names==
The specific epithet of the red imported fire ant, &quot;invicta&quot;, derives from Latin, and means &quot;invincible&quot; or &quot;unconquered&quot;. The epithet originates from the phrase &quot;Roma invicta&quot; (&quot;unconquered Rome&quot;), used as an inspirational quote until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. The generic name, &quot;Solenopsis&quot;, translates as &quot;appearance of a pipe&quot;. It is a compound of two Ancient Greek words, &quot;solen&quot;, meaning &quot;pipe&quot; or &quot;channel&quot;, and &quot;opsis&quot;, meaning &quot;appearance&quot; or &quot;sight&quot;. The ant is commonly known as the &quot;red imported fire ant&quot; (abbreviated as RIFA); the &quot;fire ant&quot; part is because of the burning sensation caused by its sting. Alternative names include &quot;fire ant&quot;, &quot;red ant&quot; or &quot;tramp ant&quot;. In Brazil, locals call the ant &quot;toicinhera&quot;, which derives from the Portuguese word &quot;toicinho&quot; (pork fat).

==Taxonomy==
The red imported fire ant was first described by Swiss entomologist Felix Santschi in a 1916 journal article published by &quot;Physis&quot;. Originally named &quot;Solenopsis saevissima wagneri&quot; from a syntype worker collected from Santiago del Estero, Argentina, Santschi believed the ant was a variant of &quot;S. saevissima&quot;; the specific epithet, &quot;wagneri&quot;, derives from the surname of E.R. Wagner, who collected the first specimens. The type material is currently housed in Naturhistorisches Museum Basel, Switzerland, but additional type workers are possibly housed in the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle, Paris. In 1930, American myrmecologist William Creighton reviewed the genus &quot;Solenopsis&quot; and reclassified the taxon as &quot;Solenopsis saevissima electra wagneri&quot; at rank, noting that he could not collect any workers that referred to Santschi&#x27;s original description. In 1952, the &quot;S. saevissima&quot; species complex was examined and, together with nine other species-group names, &quot;S. saevissima electra wagneri&quot; was synonymised with &quot;S. saevissima saevissima&quot;. This reclassification was accepted by Australian entomologist George Ettershank in his revision of the genus and in Walter Kempf&#x27;s 1972 catalogue of Neotropical ants.

In 1972, American entomologist William Buren described what he thought was a new species, naming it &quot;Solenopsis invicta&quot;. Buren collected a holotype worker from Cuiabá in Mato Grosso, Brazil, and provided the first official description of the ant in a journal article published by the Georgia Entomological Society. He accidentally misspelled &quot;invicta&quot; as above the description pages of the species, although it was clear that &quot;invicta&quot; was the intended spelling because of the constant use of the name in the article. The type material is currently housed in the National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C.

In a 1991 review of the species complex, American entomologist James Trager synonymised &quot;S. saevissima electra wagneri&quot; and &quot;S. wagneri&quot; together. Trager incorrectly cites &quot;Solenopsis saevissima electra wagneri&quot; as the original name, erroneously believing that the name &quot;S. wagneri&quot; was unavailable and used Buren&#x27;s name &quot;S. invicta&quot;. Trager previously believed that &quot;S. invicta&quot; was conspecific with &quot;S. saevissima&quot; until comparing the material with &quot;S. wagneri&quot;. Trager notes that though &quot;S. wagneri&quot; has priority over &quot;S. invicta&quot;, the name was never used above infrasubspecific rank. The use of the name since Santschi has not been associated with collected specimens, and as a result is &quot;nomen nudum&quot;. In 1995, English myrmecologist Barry Bolton corrected Trager&#x27;s error, recognising &quot;S. wagneri&quot; as the valid name and synonymised &quot;S. invicta&quot;. He states that Trager wrongfully classified &quot;S. wagneri&quot; as an unavailable name and cites &quot;S. saevissima electra wagneri&quot; as the original taxon. He concludes that &quot;S. wagneri&quot; is, in fact, the original name and has priority over &quot;S. invicta&quot;.

In 1999, Steve Shattuck and colleagues proposed conserving the name &quot;S. invicta&quot;. Since the first description of &quot;S. invicta&quot;, over 1,800 scientific papers using the name were published discussing a wide range of topics about its ecological behaviour, genetics, chemical communication, economic impacts, methods of control, population, and physiology. They state that the use of &quot;S. wagneri&quot; is a &quot;threat&quot; to nomenclatural stability towards scientists and non-scientists; taxonomists may have been able to adapt to such name change, but name confusion may arise if such case occurred. Due to this, Shattuck and his colleagues proposed the continued use of &quot;S. invicta&quot; and not &quot;S. wagneri&quot;, as this name has been rarely used; between 1995 and 1998, over 100 papers were published using &quot;S. invicta&quot; and only three using &quot;S. wagneri&quot;. They requested that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) use plenary powers to suppress &quot;S. wagneri&quot; for the purpose of the Principle of Priority and not for the Principle of Homonymy. Furthermore, they requested that the name &quot;S. invicta&quot; be added to the Official List of Specific Names in Zoology and that &quot;S. wagneri&quot; be added to the Official Index of Rejected Invalid Specific Names in Zoology. Upon review, the proposal was voted on by the entomological community and was supported by all but two voters. They note that there is no justification in suppressing &quot;S. wagneri&quot;; instead, it would be better to give precedence to &quot;S. invicta&quot; over &quot;S. wagneri&quot; whenever an author treated them as conspecific. The ICZN would conserve &quot;S. invicta&quot; and suppress &quot;S. wagneri&quot; in a 2001 review. Under the present classification, the red imported fire ant is a member of the genus &quot;Solenopsis&quot; in the tribe Solenopsidini, subfamily Myrmicinae. It is a member of the family Formicidae, belonging to the order Hymenoptera, an order of insects containing ants, bees, and wasps.

===Phylogeny===
The red imported fire ant is a member of the &quot;S. saevissima&quot; species-group. Members can be distinguished by their two-jointed clubs at the end of the funiculus in workers and queens, and the second and third segments of the funiculus are twice as long and broad in larger workers. Polymorphism occurs in all species and the mandibles bear four teeth. The following cladogram shows the position of the red imported fire ant among other members of the &quot;S. saevissima&quot; species-group:

Phenotypic and genetic data suggest that the red imported fire ant and the black imported fire ant (&quot;Solenopsis richteri&quot;) differ from each other, but they do share a close genetic relationship. Hybridisation between the two ants occurs in areas where they make contact, with the hybrid zone located in Mississippi. Such hybridisation has resulted from secondary contact between these two ants several decades ago, when they first encountered each other in southern Alabama. Based on mitochondrial DNA, examined haplotypes do not form a monophyletic clade. Some of the examined haplotypes form a closer relationship to &quot;S. megergates&quot;, &quot;S. quinquecuspis&quot; and &quot;S. richteri&quot; than they do with other &quot;S. invicta&quot; haplotypes. The occurrence of a possible paraphyletic grouping suggests that the red imported fire ant and &quot;S. quinquecuspis&quot; are possible cryptic species groups composed of several species that cannot be distinguished morphologically.

===Genetics===
Studies show that mitochondrial DNA variation occurs substantially in polygyne societies (nests with multiple queens), but no variation is detected in monogyne societies (nests with a single queen). Triploidy (a chromosomal abnormality) occurs in red imported fire ants at high rates (as high as 12% in non-reproductive females), which is linked to the high frequency of diploid males. The red imported fire ant is the first species shown to possess a green-beard gene, by which natural selection can favour altruistic behaviour. Workers containing this gene are able to distinguish between queens containing it, and those that do not, apparently by using odour cues. The workers kill queens that do not contain the gene. In 2011, scientists announced they had fully sequenced the red imported fire ant genome from a male.

==Description==
Red imported fire ant workers range in size from small to medium, making them polymorphic. Workers measure between . The head measures and is wide. In the larger workers (as in the major workers), their heads measure and wide. The antenna scapes measure and the thoracic length is . The head becomes wider behind the eyes with rounded occipital lobes present, and unlike the similar-looking &quot;S. richteri&quot;, the lobes peak further than the midline, but the occipital excision is not as crease-like. The scapes in major workers do not extend beyond occipital peak by one or two scape diameters; this feature is more noticeable in &quot;S. richteri&quot;. In medium-sized workers, the scapes reach the occipital peaks and exceed the rear border in the smallest workers. In small and medium workers, the head tends to have more elliptical sides. The head of small workers is wider out front than it is behind. In the major workers, the pronotum does not have any angular shoulders, nor does it have any sunken posteromedian area. The promesonotum is convex and the propodeum base is rounded and also convex. The base and declivity are of equal length. The suture of the promesonotum is either strong or weak in larger workers. The petiole has a thick and blunt scale; if observed from behind, it is not as rounded above in contrast to &quot;S. richteri&quot;, and sometimes it may be subtruncate. The postpetiole is large and broad, and in the larger workers, it is broader than its length. The postpetiole tends to be less broad in front and broader behind. On the rear side of the dorsal surface, a transverse impression is present. In &quot;S. richteri&quot;, this feature is also present but much weaker.

The sculpture is very similar to &quot;S. richteri&quot;. The punctures are from where pilosity arises, and these are often elongated on the dorsal and ventral portions of the head. On the thorax, striae are present, but they are less engraved with fewer punctures than in &quot;S. richteri&quot;. On the petiole, the punctates are located on the sides. The postpetiole, when viewed above, has a strong shagreen with distinct transverse punctostriae. The sides are covered in deep punctures, where they appear smaller but deeper. In &quot;S. richteri&quot;, the punctures are larger and more shallow. This gives a more opaque appearance to the surface. In some cases, punctostriae may be present around the rear portion. The pilosity appears similar to that of &quot;S. richteri&quot;. These hairs are erect and vary in length, appearing long on each side of the pronotum and mesonotum; on the head, the long hairs are seen in longitudinal rows. Numerous appressed pubescent hairs are on the petiolar scale; this is the opposite in &quot;S. richteri&quot;, as these hairs are sparse. Workers appear red and somewhat yellowish with a brown or completely black gaster. Gastric spots are sometimes seen in larger workers, where they are not as brightly coloured as those in &quot;S. richteri&quot;. The gastric spot usually covers a small portion of the first gastric tergite. The thorax is concolorous, ranging from light reddish-brown to dark-brown. The legs and coxae are usually lightly shaded. The head has a consistent colour pattern in large workers, with the occiput and vertex appearing brown. Other parts of the head, including the front, genae, and the central region of the clypeus, are either yellowish or yellowish brown. The anterior borders of the genae and mandibles are dark-brown; they also both appear to share the same coloured shade with the occiput. The scapes and funiculi range from being the same colour as the head or shares the same shade with the occiput. Light-coloured areas of the head in small to medium-sized workers is restricted to only the frontal region, with a dark mark resembling an arrow or rocket being present. On occasion, nests may have a series of different colours. For example, workers may be much darker, and the gastric spot may be completely absent or appear dark-brown.

Queens have a head length of and a width of . The scapes measure and the thorax is . The head is almost indistinguishable from &quot;S. richteri&quot;, but the occipital excision is less crease-like and the scapes are considerably shorter. Its petiolar scale is convex and resembles that of &quot;S. richteri&quot;. The postpetiole has straight sides that never concave, unlike in &quot;S. richteri&quot; where they concave. The thorax is almost identical, but the clear space between the metapleural striate area and propodeal spiracles is either a narrow crease or not present. The side portions of the petiole are punctate. The sides of the postpetiole are opaque with punctures present, but no irregular roughening is seen. The anterior of the dorsum is shagreen, and the middle and rear regions bear transverse puncto-striae. All these regions have erect hairs. The anterior portions of both the petiole and postpetiole have appressed pubescence that is also seen on the propodeum. The colour of the queen is similar to that of a worker: the gaster is dark brown and the legs, scapes, and thorax are light brown with dark streaks on the mesoscutum. The head is yellowish or yellowish-brown around the central regions, the occiput and mandibles are a similar colour to the thorax, and the wing veins range from colourless to pale brown. Males appear similar to &quot;S. richteri&quot;, but the upper borders of the petiolar scales are more concave. In both species, the postpetiole&#x27;s and petiole&#x27;s spiracles strongly project. The whole body of the male is concolorous black, but the antennae are whitish. Like the queen, the wing veins are colourless or pale brown.

The red imported ant can be misidentified as the similar-looking &quot;S. richteri&quot;. The two species can be distinguished from each other through morphological examinations of the head, thorax, and postpetiole. In &quot;S. richteri&quot;, the sides of the head are broadly elliptical and the cordate shape seen in the red imported fire ant is absent. The region of the occipital lobes that are situated nearby the midline and occipital excision appear more crease-like in &quot;S. richteri&quot; than it does in the red imported fire ant. The scapes of &quot;S. richteri&quot; are longer than they are in the red imported fire ant, and the pronotum has strong angulate shoulders. Such character is almost absent in the red imported fire ant. A shallow but sunken area is only known in the larger workers of &quot;S. richteri&quot;, which is located in the posterior region of the dorsum of the pronotum. This feature is completely absent in larger red imported fire ant workers. The red imported fire ant&#x27;s promesonotum is strongly convex, whereas this feature is weakly convex in &quot;S. richteri&quot;. Upon examination, the base of the propodeum is elongated and straight in &quot;S. richteri&quot;, while convex and shorter in the red imported fire ant. It also has a wide postpetiole with either straight or diverging sides. The postpetiole in &quot;S. richteri&quot; is narrower with converging sides. In &quot;S. richteri&quot;, the transverse impression on the posterodorsal portion of the postpetiole is strong, but weak or absent in the red imported fire ant. As well as that, &quot;S. richteri&quot; workers are 15% larger than red imported fire ant workers, are blackish-brown, and have a yellow stripe on the dorsal side of the gaster.

===Brood===
Eggs are tiny and oval-shaped, remaining the same size for around a week. After one week, the egg assumes the shape of an embryo and forms as a larva when the egg shell is removed. Larvae measure . They show a similar appearance to &quot;S. geminata&quot; larvae, but they can be distinguished by the integument with spinules on top of the dorsal portion of the posterior somites. The body hairs measure with a denticulate tip. The antennae both have two or three sensilla. The labrum is smaller with two hairs on the anterior surface that are . The maxilla has a sclerotised band between the cardo and stipes. The also has a small sclerotised band. The tubes of the labial glands are known to produce or secrete a proteinaceous substance that has a rich level of digestive enzymes, which includes proteases and amylases that function as an extraintestinal digestion of solid food. The midgut also contains amylases, roteases and upases. The narrow cells in its reservoir have little to no function in secretion. The pupae resemble adults of any caste, except that their legs and antennae are held tightly against the body. They appear white, but over time, the pupa turns darker when they are almost ready to mature.

Four larval instars have been described based on distinctive morphological characters. The larvae of the minor and major workers are impossible to distinguish before the final instar, when size differences become apparent. Upon pupation a wider head width difference between castes become more evident. Reproductive larvae are larger than worker larvae, and present discrete morphological differences in mouthparts. Fourth-instar larvae of males and queens can be differentiated based on their relative shape and body coloration, and also internal gonopodal imaginal discs can differ.

===Polymorphism===
The red imported fire ant is polymorphic with two different castes of workers: minor workers and major workers (soldiers). Like many ants that exhibit polymorphism, young, smaller ants do not forage and tend to the brood instead, while the larger workers go out and forage. In incipient colonies, polymorphism does not exist, but instead they are occupied by monomorphic workers called &quot;minims&quot; or &quot;nanitics&quot;. The average head-width in tested colonies increases during the first six months of development. In five-year-old colonies, the head width of minor workers decreases, but for major workers, the head-width remains the same. The total weight of a major worker is twice that of a minor worker when they first arrive, and by six months, major workers are four times heavier than minor workers. Once major workers develop, they can make up a large portion of the workforce, with as many as 35% being major workers in a single colony. This does not affect colony performance, as polymorphic colonies and nests with small workers produce broods at roughly the same rate, and polymorphism is not an advantage or disadvantage when food sources are not limited. However, polymorphic colonies are more energetically efficient, and under conditions where food is limited, polymorphism may provide a small advantage in brood production, but this depends on the levels of food stress.

As worker ants grow to larger sizes, the shape of the head changes, due to the head length growing at the same time as the total body length, and the head width may grow by 20%. The length of the antennae only grows slowly; the antennae may only grow 60% longer by the time the body doubles its length, thus the relative antennal length decreases by 20% as the length of the body doubles. All individual legs of the body are isometric with body length meaning that even when the length of the body doubles, the legs will also double. However, not all of the legs are the same length; the prothoracic portion accounts for 29% of leg length, the mesothoracic 31%, and the metathoracic 41%. The first two pairs of legs are of equal length to one another, whereas the final pair is longer. Overall, the morphological appearance of a worker changes dramatically when it grows larger. The head exhibits the greatest shape change and the height of the alinotum grows quicker than its length, where a height/length ratio of 0.27 in minor workers and 0.32 in major workers is seen. Due to this, larger workers tend to have a humped-shape and robust alinotum in contrast to smaller workers. No petiole segment exhibits any change in shape as the size of the body changes. The width of the gaster grows more rapidly than its length, where the width may be 96% of its length but increases to 106%.

===Physiology===
Like other insects, the red imported fire ant breathes through a system of gas-filled tubes called tracheae connected to the external environment through spiracles. The terminal tracheal branches (tracheoles) make direct contact with internal organs and tissue. The transport of oxygen to cells (and carbon dioxide out of cells) occurs through diffusion of gases between the tracheoles and the surrounding tissue and is assisted by a discontinuous gas exchange. As with other insects, the direct communication between the tracheal system and tissues eliminates the need for a circulating fluid network to transport O2. Thus, red imported fire ants and other arthropods can have a modest circulatory system though they have highly expensive metabolic demands.

The excretory system consists of three regions. The basal region has three cells found within the posterior portion of the midgut. The anterior and superior cavities are formed by the bases of four Malpighian tubules. The superior cavity opens into the lumen of the small intestine. The rectum is a large but thin-walled sac that occupies the posterior fifth of the larvae. The release of waste is controlled by the rectal valves that lead to the anus. Sometimes, the larvae secrete a liquid that consists of uric acid, water and salts. These contents are often carried outside by workers and ejected, but colonies under water stress may consume the contents. In the reproductive system, queens release a pheromone that prevents dealation and oogenesis in virgin females; those tested in colonies without a queen begin oocyte development after dealation and take up the egg-laying role. Flight muscle degeneration is initiated by mating and juvenile hormones, and prevented by . Histolysis begins with the dissolution of the myofibril and the slow breakdown of the myofilaments. Such dissolution continues until it reaches the only free Z-line materials, which would also disappear; only the nuclei and lamellar bodies remain. In one study, the amino acids increase in the hemolymph after insemination.

The glandular system contains four glands: the mandibular, maxillary, labial, and postpharyngeal glands. The postpharyngeal is well developed in the queen, while the other glands are larger in workers. The postpharyngeal gland functions as a vacuum to absorb fatty acids and triglycerides, as well as a gastric caecum. The functions of the other glands remain poorly understood. In one study discussing the enzymes of the digestion system of adult ants, lipase activity was found in the mandibular and labial glands, as well as invertase activity. The Dufour&#x27;s gland found in the ant acts as a source of trail pheromones, although scientists believed the poison gland was the source of the queen pheromone. The neurohormone pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide is found in the ant that activates the biosynthesis of pheromones from the Dufour&#x27;s gland. The spermatheca gland is found in queens, which functions in sperm maintenance. Males appear to lack these glands, but those associated with its head are morphologically similar to those found in workers, but these glands may act differently.

The ant faces many respiratory challenges due to its highly variable environment, which can cause increased desiccation, hypoxia, and hypercapnia. Hot, humid climates cause an increase in heart rate and respiration which increases energy and water loss. Hypoxia and hypercapnia can result from red imported fire ant colonies living in poorly ventilated thermoregulatory mounds and underground nests. Discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) may allow ants to survive the hypercapnic and hypoxic conditions frequently found in their burrows; it is ideal for adapting to these conditions because it allows the ants to increase the period of O2 intake and CO2 expulsion independently through spiracle manipulation. The invasion success of the red imported fire ant may possibly be related to its physiological tolerance to abiotic stress, being more heat tolerant and more adaptable to desiccation stress than &quot;S. richteri&quot;. This means that the ant is less vulnerable to heat and desiccation stress. Although &quot;S. richteri&quot; has higher water body content than the red imported fire ant, &quot;S. richteri&quot; was more vulnerable to desiccation stress. The lower sensitivity to desiccation is due to a lower water loss rate. Colonies living in unshaded and warmer sites tend to have a higher heat tolerance than those living in shaded and cooler sites.

Metabolic rate, which indirectly affects respiration, is also influenced by environmental temperature. Peak metabolism occurs at about 32 °C. Metabolism, and therefore respiration rate, increases consistently as temperature increases. DGE stops above 25 °C, although the reason for this is currently unknown.

Respiration rate also appears to be influenced significantly by caste. Males show a considerably higher rate of respiration than females and workers, due, in part, to their capability for flight and higher muscle mass. In general, males have more muscle and less fat, resulting in a higher metabolic O2 demand.
While the metabolic rate is highest at 32 °C, colonies often thrive at slightly cooler temperatures (around 25 °C). The high rate of metabolic activity associated with warmer temperatures is a limiting factor on colony growth because the need for food consumption is also increased. As a result, larger colonies tend to be found in cooler conditions because the metabolic demands required to sustain a colony are decreased.

==Distribution and habitat==
Red imported fire ants are native to the tropical areas of central South America, where they have an expansive geographical range that extends from southeastern Peru to central Argentina, and to the south of Brazil. In contrast to its geographical range in North America, its range in South America is significantly different. It has an extremely long north–south range, but a very narrow east–west distribution. The northernmost record of the red imported fire ant is Porto Velho in Brazil, and its southernmost record is Resistencia in Argentina; this is a distance of about . In comparison, the width of its narrow range is about , and this is most likely narrower into southern Argentina and Paraguay and into the northern areas of the Amazon River basin. Most known records of the red imported fire ant are around the Pantanal region of Brazil. However, the interior of this area has not been examined thoroughly, but it is certain that the species occurs in favourable locations around it. The Pantanal region is thought to be the original homeland of the red imported fire ant; hydrochore dispersal via floating ant rafts could easily account for the far south populations around the Paraguay and Guaporé Rivers. The western extent of its range is not known exactly, but its abundance there may be limited. It may be extensive in easternmost Bolivia, owing to the presence of the Pantanal region.

These ants are native to Argentina, and the red imported fire ant most likely came from here when they first invaded the United States; in particular, populations of these ants have been found in the provinces of Chaco, Corrientes, Formosa, Santiago del Estero, Santa Fe, and Tucumán. The northeastern regions of Argentina are the most credible guess where the invading ants originate. In Brazil, they are found in northern Mato Grosso and in Rondônia and in São Paulo state. The red imported fire ant and &quot;S. saevissima&quot; are parapatric in Brazil, with contact zones known in Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná state and São Paulo. In Paraguay they are found throughout the country, and have been recorded in Boquerón, Caaguazú, Canindeyú, Central, Guairá, Ñeembucú, Paraguarí, and Presidente Hayes departments; Trager claims that the ant is distributed in all regions of the country. They are also found in a large portion of northeastern Bolivia and, to a lesser extent, in northwestern Uruguay.
The red imported fire ant is able to dominate altered areas and live in a variety of habitats. It can survive the extreme weather of the South American rain forest, and in disturbed areas, nests are seen frequently alongside roads and buildings. The ant has been observed frequently around the floodplains of the Paraguay River. In areas where water is present, they are commonly found around: irrigation channels, lakes, ponds, reservoirs, rivers, streams, riverbanks, and mangrove swamps. Nests are found in agricultural areas, coastlands, wetlands, coastal dune remnants, deserts, forests, grasslands, natural forests, oak woodland, mesic forest, leaf-litter, beach margins, shrublands, alongside rail and roads, and in urban areas. In particular, they are found in cultivated land, managed forests and plantations, disturbed areas, intensive livestock production systems, and greenhouses. Red imported fire ants have been found to invade buildings, including medical facilities. In urban areas, colonies dwell in open areas, especially if the area is sunny. This includes: urban gardens, picnic areas, lawns, playgrounds, schoolyards, parks, and golf courses. In some areas, there are on average 200 mounds per acre. During winter, colonies move under pavements or into buildings, and newly mated queens move into pastures. Red imported fire ants are mostly found at altitudes between above sea level.

Mounds range from small to large, measuring in height and in diameter with no visible entrances. Workers are only able to access their nests through a series of tunnels that protrude from the central region. Such protrusions can span up to 25 feet away from the central mound, either straight down in to the ground or, more commonly, sideways from the original mound. Constructed from soil, mounds are oriented so that the long portions of the mound face toward the sun during the early morning and before sunset. Mounds are usually oval-shaped with the long axis of the nest orientating itself in a north–south direction. These ants also spend large amounts of energy in nest construction and transporting brood, which is related with thermoregulation. The brood is transported to areas where temperatures are high; workers track temperature patterns of the mound and do not rely on behavioural habits. Inside nests, mounds contain a series of narrow horizontal tunnels, with subterranean shafts and nodes reaching grass roots below the surface; these shafts and nodes connect the mound tunnels to the subterranean chambers. These chambers are about 5 cm2 (0.77 inch2) and reach depths of . The mean number of ants in a single subterranean chamber is around 200.

===Introductions===

Red imported fire ants are among the worst invasive species in the world. Some scientists consider the red imported fire ant to be a &quot;disturbance specialist&quot;; human disturbance to the environment may be a major factor behind the ants&#x27; impact (fire ants tend to favour disturbed areas). This is shown through one experiment, demonstrating that mowing and plowing in studied areas diminished the diversity and abundance of native ant species, whereas red imported fire ants found on undisturbed forest plots had only diminished a couple of species.

In the United States, the red imported fire ant first arrived in the seaport of Mobile, Alabama, by cargo ship between 1933 and 1945. Arriving with an estimated 9 to 20 unrelated queens, the red imported fire ant was only rare at the time, as entomologists were unable to collect any specimens (with the earliest observations first made in 1942, preceded by a population expansion in 1937); the population of these ants exploded by the 1950s. Since its introduction to the United States, the red imported fire ant has spread throughout the southern states and northeastern Mexico, negatively affecting wildlife and causing economic damage. The expansion of red imported fire ants may be limited since they are almost wiped out during Tennessee winters, thus they may be reaching their northernmost range. However, global warming may allow the red imported fire ant to expand its geographical range. As of 2004, the ant is found in 13 states and occupies over 128 million hectares of land, and as many as 400 mounds can be found on a single acre of land. The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that they expand westward per year. Likely due to absence of South American competitorsand lower numbers of native competitors&quot;S. invicta&quot; dominates more extrafloral nectaries and hemipteran honeydew sources in the Southern U.S. than in its home range.

Red imported fire ants were first discovered in Queensland, Australia, in 2001. The ants were believed to be present in shipping containers arriving at the Port of Brisbane, most likely from North America. Anecdotal evidence suggests fire ants may have been present in Australia for six to eight years prior to formal identification. The potential damage from the red imported fire ant prompted the Australian government to respond rapidly. A joint state and federal funding of A$175 million was granted for a six-year eradication programme. Following years of eradication, eradication rates of greater than 99% from previously infested properties were reported. The program received extended Commonwealth funding of around A$10 million for at least another two years to treat the residual infestations found most recently. In December 2014, a nest was identified at Port Botany, Sydney, in New South Wales. The port was quarantined, and a removal operation took place. In September 2015, populations originating from the United States were found at a Brisbane airport. Hundreds of millions of dollars have since been allocated to their eradication. In August 2023, the Invasive Species Council said that without additional funding, fire ants would probably spread into northern New South Wales and west, potentially into the Murray Darling Basin.

Red imported fire ants have spread beyond North America. The Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) reports the ant inhabiting at least three of the Cayman Islands. However, the sources the ISSG cited give no report about them on the island, but recent collections indicate that they are present. In 2001, red imported fire ants were discovered in New Zealand, but they were successfully eradicated several years later. Red imported fire ants have been reported in India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore. However, these reports were found to be incorrect as the ants collected there were incorrectly identified as the red imported fire ant. In Singapore, the ants were most likely misidentified as well. In India, surveyed ants in Sattur Taluk, India listed the red imported fire ant there in high populations; meanwhile, no reports of the ant were made outside the surveyed area. In 2016, scientists state that despite no presence of the ant in India, the red imported fire ant will more than likely find suitable habitats within India&#x27;s ecosystem if given the opportunity. The reports in the Philippines most likely misidentified collected material as the red imported fire ant, as no populations have been found there. It was, however, positively identified in Hong Kong and mainland China in 2004, where they have spread into several provinces as well as Macau and Taiwan. No geographic or climatic barriers prevent these ants from spreading further, thus it may spread throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. In Europe, a single nest was found in the Netherlands in 2002. For the first time, in 2023, ant colonies have been found in Europe.

Around 1980, red imported fire ants began spreading throughout the West Indies, where they were first reported in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Between 1991 and 2001, the ant was recorded from Trinidad and Tobago, several areas in the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, Antigua, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Since then, red imported fire ants have been recorded on more islands and regions, with new populations discovered in: Anguilla, Saint Martin, Barbuda, Montserrat, Saint Kitts, Nevis, Aruba, and Jamaica. The ants recorded from Aruba and Jamaica have only been found on golf courses; these courses import sod from Florida, so such importation may be an important way for the ant to spread throughout the West Indies.

Populations found outside North America originate from the United States. In 2011, the DNA of specimens from Australia, China, and Taiwan was analysed with results showing that they are related to those in the United States. Despite the spread of the red imported fire ant (&quot;S. invicta&quot;), &quot;S. geminata&quot; has a greater geographical range, but it can be easily displaced by &quot;S. invicta&quot;. Because of this, almost all of &quot;S. geminata&quot;&#x27;s exotic range in North America has been lost and it has almost disappeared there. On roadsides in Florida, 83% of these sites had &quot;S. geminata&quot; present when the red imported fire ant was absent, but only 7% when it is present. This means that the ant can probably invade many tropical and subtropical regions where &quot;S. geminata&quot; populations are present.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Red imported fire ants are extremely resilient and have adapted to contend with both flooding and drought conditions. If the ants sense increased water levels in their nests, they link together and form a ball or raft that floats, with the workers on the outside and the queen inside. The brood is transported to the highest surface. They are also used as the founding structure of the raft, except for the eggs and smaller larvae. Before submerging, the ants will tip themselves into the water and sever connections with the dry land. In some cases, workers may deliberately remove all males from the raft, resulting in the males drowning. The longevity of a raft can be as long as 12 days. Ants that are trapped underwater escape by lifting themselves to the surface using bubbles which are collected from submerged substrate. Owing to their greater vulnerability to predators, red imported fire ants are significantly more aggressive when rafting. Workers tend to deliver higher doses of venom, which reduces the threat of other animals attacking. Due to this, and because a higher workforce of ants is available, rafts are potentially dangerous to those that encounter them.

Necrophoric behaviour occurs in the red imported fire ant. Workers discard uneaten food and other such wastes away from the nest. The active component was not identified, but the fatty acids accumulating as a result of decomposition were implicated and bits of paper coated with synthetic oleic acid typically elicited a necrophoric response. The process behind this behaviour in imported red fire ants was confirmed by Blum (1970): unsaturated fats, such as oleic acid, elicit corpse-removal behaviour. Workers also show differentiated responses towards dead workers and pupae. Dead workers are usually taken away from the nest, whereas the pupae may take a day for a necrophoric response to occur. Pupae infected by &quot;Metarhizium anisopliae&quot; are usually discarded by workers at a higher rate: while 47.5% of unaffected corpses are discarded within a day, for affected corpses this figure is 73.8%.

Red imported fire ants have negative impacts on seed germination. The extent of the damage, however, depends on how long seeds are vulnerable for (dry and germinating) and by the abundance of the ants. One study showed that while these ants are attracted to and remove seeds which have adapted for ant dispersal, red imported fire ants damage these seeds or move them in unfavourable locations for germination. In seeds given to colonies, 80% of &quot;Sanguinaria canadensis&quot; seeds were scarified and 86% of &quot;Viola rotundifolia&quot; seeds were destroyed. Small percentages of longleaf pine (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;) seeds deposited by workers successfully germinate, thus providing evidence that red imported fire ants help the movement of seeds in the longleaf pine ecosystem. Elaiosome-bearing seeds are collected at a higher rate in contrast to nonelaiosome-bearing seeds and do not store them in their nests, but rather in surface trash piles in the mound vicinity.

===Foraging and communication===
Colonies of the red imported fire ant have tunneling surfaces that protrude out of the surfaces where workers forage. These areas of protrusion tend to be within their own territory, but greater ant colonisation can affect this. Tunnels are designed to allow effective body, limb and antennae interactions with walls, and a worker can also move exceptionally fast inside them (more than nine bodylengths per second). The holes exit out of any point within the colony&#x27;s territory, and foraging workers may need to travel half a metre to reach the surface. Assuming the average forager travels 5 m, over 90% of foraging time is inside the tunnels during the day and rarely at night. Workers forage in soil temperatures reaching and surface temperatures of . Workers exposed to temperatures of are at risk of dying from the heat. The rate of workers foraging drops rapidly by autumn, and they rarely emerge during winter. This may be due to the effects of soil temperature, and a decreased preference for food sources. These preferences only decrease when brood production is low. In the northern regions of the United States, areas are too cold for the ant to forage, but in other areas such as Florida and Texas, foraging may occur all year round. When it is raining, workers do not forage outside, as exit holes are temporarily blocked, pheromone trails are washed away, and foragers may be physically struck by the rain. The soil&#x27;s moisture may also affect the foraging behaviour of workers.

When workers are foraging, it is characterised by three steps: searching, recruitment, and transportation. Workers tend to search for honey more often than other food sources, and the weight of food has no impact on searching time. Workers may recruit other nestmates if the food they have found is too heavy, taking as much as 30 minutes for the maximum number of recruited workers to arrive. Lighter food sources take less time and are usually transported rapidly. Foraging workers become scouts and search solely for food outside the surface, and may subsequently die two weeks later from old age.

Workers communicate by a series of semiochemicals and pheromones. These communication methods are used in a variety of activities, such as nestmate recruitment, foraging, attraction, and defence; for example, a worker may secrete trail pheromones if a food source it discovered is too large to carry. These pheromones are synthesized by the Dufour&#x27;s gland and may trail from the discovered food source back to the nest. The components in these trail pheromones are also species-specific to this ant only, in contrast to other ants with common tail pheromones. The poison sack in this species has been identified as being the novel storage site of the queen pheromone; this pheromone is known to elicit orientation in worker individuals, resulting in the deposition of brood. It is also an attractant, where workers aggregate toward areas where the pheromone has been released. A brood pheromone is possibly present, as workers are able to segregate brood by their age and caste, which is followed by licking, grooming and . If a colony is under attack, workers will release alarm pheromones. However, these pheromones are poorly developed in workers. Workers can detect pyrazines which are produced by the alates; these pyrazines may be involved in nuptial flight, as well as an alarm response.

Red imported fire ants can distinguish nestmates and non-nestmates through chemical communication and specific colony odours. Workers prefer to dig into nest materials from their own colony and not from soil in unnested areas or from other red imported fire ant colonies. One study suggests that as a colony&#x27;s diet is similar, the only difference between nested and unnested soil was the nesting of the ants themselves. Therefore, workers may transfer colony odour within the soil. Colony odour can be affected by the environment, as workers in lab-reared colonies are less aggressive than those in the wild. Queen-derived cues are able to regulate nestmate recognition in workers and amine levels. However, these cues do not play a major role in colony-level recognition, but they can serve as a form of caste-recognition within nests. Workers living in monogyne societies tend to be extremely aggressive and attack intruders from neighbouring nests. In queenless colonies, the addition of alien queens or workers does not increase aggression among the population.

===Diet===
Red imported fire ants are omnivores, and foragers are considered to be scavengers rather than predators. The ants&#x27; diet consists of dead mammals, arthropods, insects, earthworms, vertebrates, and solid food matter such as seeds. However, this species prefers liquid over solid food. The liquid food the ants collect is sweet substances from plants or honeydew-producing hemipterans. Arthropod prey may include dipteran adults, larvae and pupae, and termites. The consumption of sugar amino acid is known to affect recruitment of workers to plant nectars. Mimic plants with sugar rarely have workers to feed on them, whereas those with sugar and amino acids have considerable numbers. The habitats where they live may determine the food they collect the most; for example, forage success rates for solid foods are highest in lakeshore sites, while high levels of liquid sources were collected from pasture sites. Specific diets can also alter the growth of a colony, with laboratory colonies showing high growth if fed honey-water. Colonies that feed on insects and sugar-water can grow exceptionally large in a short period of time, whereas those that do not feed on sugar-water grow substantially slower. Colonies that do not feed on insects cease brood production entirely. Altogether, the volume of food digested by nestmates is regulated within colonies. Larvae are able to display independent appetites for sources such as solid proteins, amino acid solutions, and sucrose solutions, and they also prefer these sources over dilute solutions. Such behaviour is due to their capability to communicate hunger to workers. The rate of consumption depends on the type, concentration, and state of the food on which they feed. Workers tend to recruit more nestmates to food sources filled with high levels of sucrose than to protein.

Food distribution plays an important role in a colony. This behaviour varies in colonies, with small workers receiving more food than larger workers if a small colony is seriously deprived of food. In larger colonies, however, the larger workers receive more food. Workers can donate sugar water efficiently to other nestmates, with some acting as donors. These &quot;donors&quot; distribute their food sources to recipients, which may also act as donors. Workers may also share a greater portion of their food with other nestmates. In colonies that are not going through starvation, food is still distributed among the workers and larvae. One study shows that honey and soybean oil were fed to the larvae after 12 to 24 hours of being retained by the workers. The ratio distribution of these food sources was 40% towards the larvae and 60% towards the worker for honey, and for soybean oil this figure was around 30 and 70%, respectively. Red imported fire ants also stockpile specific food sources such as insect pieces rather than consuming them immediately. These pieces are usually transported below the mound surface and in the driest and warmest locations.

This species engages in trophallaxis with the larvae. Regardless of the attributes and conditions of each larva, they are fed roughly the same amount of liquid food. The rate of trophallaxis may increase with larval food deprivation, but such increase depends on the size of each larva. Larvae that are fed regularly tend to be given small amounts. To reach satiation, all larvae regardless of their size generally require the equivalent of eight hours of feeding.

===Predators===
A number of insects, arachnids, and birds prey on these ants, especially when queens are trying to establish a new colony. While in the absence of defending workers, the fire ant queens must rely on their venom to keep off competitor species. Many species of dragonfly, including &quot;Anax junius&quot;, &quot;Pachydiplax longipennis&quot;, &quot;Somatochlora provocans&quot;, and &quot;Tramea carolina&quot;, capture the queens while they are in flight; 16 species of spiders, including the wolf spider &quot;Lycosa timuga&quot; and the southern black widow spider (&quot;Latrodectus mactans&quot;), actively kill red imported fire ants. &quot;L. mactans&quot; captures all castes of the species (the workers, queens, and males) within its web. These ants constitute 75% of prey captured by the spider. Juvenile &quot;L. mactans&quot; spiders have also been seen capturing the ants. Other invertebrates that prey on red imported fire ants are earwigs (&quot;Labidura riparia&quot;) and tiger beetles (&quot;Cicindela punctulata&quot;). Birds that eat these ants include the chimney swift (&quot;Chaetura pelagica&quot;), the eastern kingbird (&quot;Tyrannus tyrannus&quot;), and the eastern bobwhite (&quot;Colinus virginianus virginianus&quot;). The eastern bobwhite attacks these ants by digging out the mounds looking for young queens. Red imported fire ants have been found in stomach contents inside of armadillos.

Many species of ants have been observed attacking queens and killing them. Apparently, the venom of fire ant queens is chemically adapted to rapidly subdue offending competitor ants. Predatory ants include: &quot;Ectatomma edentatum&quot;, &quot;Ephebomyrmex&quot; spp., &quot;Lasius neoniger&quot;, &quot;Pheidole&quot; spp., &quot;Pogonomyrmex badius,&quot; and &quot;Conomyrma insana&quot;, which is among the most significant. &quot;C. insana&quot; ants are known to be effective predators against founding queens in studied areas of Northern Florida. The pressure of attacks initiated by &quot;C. insana&quot; increase over time, causing queens to exhibit different reactions, including escaping, concealment, or defence. Most queens that are attacked by these ants are ultimately killed. Queens that are in groups have higher chances of survival than solitary queens if they are attacked by &quot;S. geminata&quot;. Ants can attack queens on the ground and invade nests by stinging and dismembering them. Other ants such as &quot;P. porcula&quot; try to take the head and gaster, and &quot;C. clara&quot; invade in groups. Also, certain ants try to drag queens out of their nests by pulling on the antennae or legs. Small, monomorphic ants rely on recruitment to kill queens and do not attack them until reinforcements arrive. Aside from killing the queen, some ants may steal the eggs for consumption or emit a repellent that is effective against red imported fire ants. Certain ant species may raid colonies and destroy them.

===Parasites, pathogens and viruses===
Flies in the genus &quot;Pseudacteon&quot; (phorid flies) are known to be parasitic to ants. Some species within this genus, such as Pseudacteon tricuspis, have been introduced into the environment for the purpose of controlling the imported fire ant. These flies are parasitoids of the red imported fire ant in its native range in South America, and can be attracted through the ants&#x27; venom alkaloids. One species, &quot;Pseudacteon obtusus&quot;, attacks the ant by landing on the posterior portion of the head and laying an egg. The location of the egg makes it impossible for the ant to successfully remove it. The larvae migrate to the head, then develop by feeding on the hemolymph, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. After about two weeks, they cause the ant&#x27;s head to fall off by releasing an enzyme that dissolves the membrane attaching the head to its body. The fly pupates in the detached head capsule, emerging two weeks later. &quot;P. tricuspis&quot; is another phorid fly that is a parasitoid to this species. Although parasitism pressures by these flies do not affect the ants&#x27; population density and activity, it has a small effect on a colony population. The strepsipteran insect &quot;Caenocholax fenyesi&quot; is known to infect male ants of this species and attack the eggs, and the mite &quot;Pyemotes tritici&quot; has been considered a potential biological agent against red imported fire ants, capable of parasitising every caste within the colony. Bacteria, such as &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, has been found in the red imported fire ant; three different variants of the bacteria are known to infect the red imported fire ant. However, its effect on the ant is unknown. &quot;Solenopsis daguerrei&quot; is a reproductive parasite to red imported fire ant colonies.

A large variety of pathogens and nematodes also infect red imported fire ants. Pathogens include &quot;Myrmecomyces annellisae&quot;, &quot;Mattesia&quot; spp., &quot;Steinernema&quot; spp., a mermithid nematode, &quot;Vairimorpha invictae&quot;, which can be transmitted via live larvae and pupae and dead adults and &quot;Tetradonema solenopsis&quot;, which can be fatal to a large portion of a colony. Individuals infected by &quot;Metarhizium anisopliae&quot; tend to perform trophallaxis more frequently and have an enhanced preference to quinine, an alkaloid substance. Phorid flies with &quot;Kneallhazia solenopsae&quot; can serve as vectors in transmitting the disease to the ants. Weakening the colony, infections from this disease are localised within the body fat, with spores only occurring in adult individuals. The mortality of an infected colony tends to be greater in contrast to those that are healthy. These ants are a host to &quot;Conidiobolus&quot;, &quot;Myrmicinosporidium durum,&quot; and &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot;, each of which are parasitic fungi. Infected individuals have spores all over their bodies and appear darker than usual. The toxicity from antimicrobial property of volatiles produced by the ants can significantly reduce the germination rate of &quot;B. bassiana&quot; within the colony.

A virus, &quot;S. invicta 1&quot; (SINV-1), has been found in about 20% of fire ant fields, where it appears to cause the slow death of infected colonies. It has proven to be self-sustaining and transmissible. Once introduced, it can eliminate a colony within three months. Researchers believe the virus has potential as a viable biopesticide to control fire ants. Two more viruses have also been discovered: &quot;S. invicta&quot; 2 (SINV-2) and &quot;S. invicta&quot; 3 (SINV-3). Polygynous colonies tend to face greater infections in contrast to monogynous colonies. Multiple virus infections can also occur.

===Lifecycle and reproduction===
Nuptial flight in red imported fire ants begins during the warmer seasons of the year (spring and summer), usually two days after rain. The time alates emerge and mate is between noon and 3:00pm. Nuptial flights recorded in North Florida have, on average, 690 female and male alates participating in a single flight. Males are the first to leave the nest, and both sexes readily undertake flight with little to no preflight activity. However, workers swarm the mound excitedly stimulated by mandibular glands within the head of the alates. As mounds do not have holes, workers form holes during nuptial flight as a way for the alates to emerge. This behaviour in workers, elicited by the pheromones, includes rapid running and back-and-forth movements, and increased aggression. Workers also cluster themselves around the alates as they climb up on vegetation, and in some cases, attempt to pull them back down before they take flight. Chemical cues from males and females during nuptial flight attract workers, but chemical cues released by workers do not attract other nestmates. It also induces alarm-recruitment behaviour in workers which results in a higher rate of alate retrieval.

Males fly at higher elevations than females: captured males are usually above the surface, whereas the females are only above the surface. A nuptial flight takes place for roughly half an hour and females generally fly for less than before landing. About 95% of queens successfully mate and only mate once; some males may be infertile due to the testicular lobes failing to develop. In polygyne colonies, males do not play a significant role and most are, therefore, sterile; one of the reasons for this is to avoid mating with other ant species. This also makes male mortality selective, which may affect the breeding system, mating success and, gene flow. Ideal conditions for a nuptial flight to begin is when humidity levels are above 80% and when the soil temperature is above . Nuptial flights only occur when the ambient temperature is .

Queens are often found 1–2.3 miles from the nest they flew from.
Colony founding can be done by an individual or in groups, known as pleometrosis. This joint effort of the co-foundresses contributes to the growth and survival of the incipient colony; nests founded by multiple queens begin the growth period with three times as many workers when compared to colonies founded by a single queen. Despite this, such associations are not always stable. The emergence of the first workers instigates queen-queen and queen-worker fighting. In pleometrotic conditions, only one queen emerges victorious, whereas the queens that lost are subsequently killed by the workers. The two factors that could affect the survival of individual queens are their relative fighting capabilities and their relative contribution to worker production. Size, an indicator of fighting capacity, positively correlates with survival rates. However, manipulation of the queen&#x27;s relative contribution to worker production had no correlation with survival rate.

A single queen lays around 10 to 15 eggs 24 hours after mating. In established nests, a queen applies venom onto each egg that perhaps contains a signal calling for workers to move it. These eggs remain unchanged in size for one week until they hatch into larvae. By this time, the queen will have laid about 75 to 125 more eggs. The larvae that hatch from their eggs are usually covered in their shell membranes for several days. The larvae can free their mouthparts from their shells using body movements, but still need assistance from workers with hatching. The larval stage is divided into four instars, as observed through the moulting stages. At the end of each moult, a piece of unknown material is seen connected to the exuviae if they are isolated from the workers. The larval stage lasts between six and 12 days before their bodies expand significantly and become pupae; the pupal stage lasts between nine and 16 days.

As soon as the first individuals reach the pupal stage, the queen ceases egg production until the first workers mature. This process takes two weeks to one month. The young larvae are fed oils which are regurgitated from her crop, as well as trophic eggs or secretions. She also feeds the young her wing muscles, providing the young with needed nutrients. The first generation of workers are always small because of the limit of nutrients needed for development. These workers are known as minims or nanitics, which burrow out of the queen&#x27;s chamber and commence foraging for food needed for the colony. Mound construction also occurs at this time. Within a month after the first generation is born, larger workers (major workers) start to develop, and within six months, the mound will be noticeable, if viewed, and houses several thousand residents. A mature queen is capable of laying 1,500 eggs per day; all workers are sterile, so cannot reproduce.

A colony can grow exceptionally fast. Colonies that housed 15–20 workers in May grew to over 7,000 by September. These colonies started to produce reproductive ants when they were a year old, and by the time they were two years old, they had over 25,000 workers. The population doubled to 50,000 when these colonies were three years old. At maturity, a colony can house 100,000 to 250,000 individuals, but other reports suggest that colonies can hold more than 400,000. Polygyne colonies have the potential to grow much larger than monogyne colonies.

Several factors contribute to colony growth. Temperature plays a major role in colony growth and development; colony growth ceases below 24 °C and developmental time decreases from 55 days at temperatures of 24 °C to 23 days at 35 °C. Growth in established colonies only occurs at temperatures between 24 and 36 °C. Nanitic brood also develops far quicker than minor worker brood (around 35% faster), which is beneficial for founding colonies. Colonies that have access to an unlimited amount of insect prey are known to grow substantially, but this growth is further accelerated if they are able to access plant resources colonised by hemipteran insects. In incipient monogyne colonies where diploid males are produced, colony mortality rates are significantly high and colony growth is slow. In some cases, monogyne colonies experience 100% mortality rates in the early stages of development.

The life expectancy of a worker ant depends on its size, although the overall average is around 62 days. Minor workers are expected to live for about 30 to 60 days, whereas the larger workers live much longer. Larger workers, which have a life expectancy of 60 to 180 days, live 50–140% longer than their smaller counterparts, but this depends on the temperature. However, workers kept in laboratory conditions have been known to live for 10 to 70 weeks (70 days to 490 days); the maximum recorded longevity of a worker is 97 weeks (or 679 days). The queens live much longer than the workers, with a lifespan ranging from two years to nearly seven years.

In colonies, queens are the only ants able to alter sex ratios which can be predicted. For example, queens originating from male-producing colonies tend to produce predominantly males, while queens that came from female-favoured sex ratio colonies tend to produce females. Queens also exert control over the production of sexuals through pheromones that influence the behaviours of workers toward both male and female larvae.

===Monogyny and polygyny===
There are two forms of society in the red imported fire ant: polygynous colonies and monogynous colonies. Polygynous colonies differ substantially from monogynous colonies in social insects. The former experience reductions in queen fecundity, dispersal, longevity, and nestmate relatedness. Polygynous queens are also less physogastric than monogynous queens and workers are smaller. Understanding the mechanisms behind queen recruitment is integral to understanding how these differences in fitness are formed. It is unusual that the number of older queens in a colony does not influence new queen recruitment. Levels of queen pheromone, which appears to be related to queen number, play important roles in the regulation of reproduction. It would follow that workers would reject new queens when exposed to large quantities of this queen pheromone. Moreover, evidence supports the claim that queens in both populations enter nests at random, without any regard for the number of older queens present. There is no correlation between the number of older queens and the number of newly recruited queens. Three hypotheses have been posited to explain the acceptance of multiple queens into established colonies: mutualism, kin selection, and parasitism. The mutualism hypothesis states that cooperation leads to an increase in the personal fitness of older queens. However, this hypothesis is not consistent with the fact that increasing queen number decreases both queen production and queen longevity. Kin selection also seems unlikely given that queens have been observed to cooperate under circumstances where they are statistically unrelated. Therefore, queens experience no gain in personal fitness by allowing new queens into the colony. Parasitism of preexisting nests appears to be the best explanation of polygyny. One theory is that so many queens attempt to enter the colony that the workers get confused and inadvertently allow several queens to join it.

Monogyne workers kill foreign queens and aggressively defend their territory. However, not all behaviours are universal, primarily because worker behaviours depend on the ecological context in which they develop, and the manipulation of worker genotypes can elicit change in behaviours. Therefore, behaviours of native populations can differ from those of introduced populations. In a study to assess the aggressive behaviour of monogyne and polygyne red fire ant workers by studying interaction in neutral arenas, and to develop a reliable ethogram for readily distinguishing between monogyne and polygyne colonies of red imported fire ants in the field, monogyne and polygyne workers discriminated between nestmates and foreigners as indicated by different behaviours ranging from tolerance to aggression. Monogyne ants always attacked foreign ants independently if they were from monogyne or polygyne colonies, whereas polygyne ants recognised, but did not attack, foreign polygyne ants, mainly by exhibiting postures similar to behaviours assumed after attacks by &quot;Pseudacteon&quot; phorids. Hostile versus warning behaviours were strongly dependent on the social structure of workers. Therefore, the behaviour toward foreign workers was a method of characterising monogyne and polygyne colonies. Most colonies in the southeastern and south-central US tend to be monogynous.

The monogynous red imported fire ant colony territorial area and the mound size are positively correlated, which, in turn, is regulated by the colony size (number and biomass of workers), distance from neighbouring colonies, prey density, and by the colony&#x27;s collective competitive ability. In contrast, nestmate discrimination among polygynous colonies is more relaxed as workers tolerate conspecific ants alien to the colony, accept other heterozygote queens, and do not aggressively protect their territory from polygyne conspecifics. These colonies might increase their reproductive output as a result of having many queens and the possibility of exploiting greater territories by means of cooperative recruitment and interconnected mounds.

A social chromosome is present in the red imported fire ant. This chromosome can differentiate the social organisation of a colony carrying one of two variants of a supergene (B and b) which contains more than 600 genes. The social chromosome has often been compared to sexual chromosomes because they share similar genetic features and they define colony phenotype in a similar way. For example, colonies exclusively carrying the B variant of this chromosome accept single BB queens, but colonies with both B and b variants will accept multiple Bb queens only. Differences in another single gene can also determine whether the colony will have single or multiple queens.

===Relationship with other animals===
==== Competition ====
When polygyne forms invade areas where colonies have not yet been established, the diversity of native arthropods and vertebrates declines greatly. This is evident as populations of isopods, mites and tumblebug scarabs decline significantly. They can also significantly alter the populations of many fly and beetle families, including: Calliphoridae, Histeridae, Muscidae, Sarcophagidae, Silphidae, and Staphylinidae. Despite this, one review found that certain insects may be unaffected by red imported fire ants; for example, the density of isopods decreases in red imported fire ant infested areas, but crickets of the genus &quot;Gryllus&quot; are unaffected. There are some cases where the diversity of certain insect and arthropod species increase in areas where red imported fire ants are present. Red imported fire ants are important predators on cave invertebrates, some of which are endangered species. This includes harvestmen, pseudoscorpions, spiders, ground
beetles, and pselaphid beetles. The biggest concern is not the ant itself, but the bait used to treat them because this can prove fatal. Stock Island tree snails (&quot;Orthalicus reses&quot;) are extinct in the wild; predation by red imported fire ants is believed to be the major factor in the snail&#x27;s extinction. Overall, red imported fire ants prefer specific arthropods to others, although they attack and kill any invertebrate that cannot defend itself or escape. Arthropod biodiversity increases once red imported fire ant populations are either reduced or eradicated.

Interactions between red imported fire ants and mammals have been rarely documented. However, deaths of live-trapped animals by red imported fire ants have been observed. Mortality rates in eastern cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;) young range from 33 to 75% because of red imported fire ants. It is believed that red imported fire ants have a strong impact on many herpetofauna species; scientists have noted population declines in the Florida kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis getula floridana&quot;), and eggs and adults of the eastern fence lizard (&quot;Sceloporus undulatus&quot;) and six-lined racerunner (&quot;Aspidoscelis sexlineata&quot;) are a source of food. Because of this, eastern fence lizards have adapted to have longer legs and new behaviours to escape the red imported fire ant. Additionally, another lizard species, &quot;Sphaerodactylus macrolepis&quot; are also a target of the fire ants&#x27; and have developed tactics to fend them off, such as tail flicks. Adult three-toed box turtles (&quot;Terrapene carolina triunguis&quot;), Houston toad (&quot;Anaxyrus houstonensis&quot;) juveniles, and American alligator (&quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;) hatchlings are also attacked and killed by these ants. Despite this mostly-negative association, one study shows that red imported fire ants may be capable of impacting vector-borne disease transmissions by regulating tick populations and altering vector and host dynamics, thereby reducing transmission rates not only to animals, but to humans as well.

Mortality rates have been well observed in birds; there have been instances where no young have survived to adulthood in areas with high fire ant density. Many birds including cliff nesting swallows, ducks, egrets, quail, and terns have been affected by red imported fire ants. Ground nesting birds, particularly the least tern (&quot;Sterna antillarum&quot;), are vulnerable to fire ant attacks. The impact of red imported fire ants on colonial breeding birds is especially severe; waterbirds can experience a mortality rate of 100%, although this factor was lower for early-nesting birds. Brood survival decreases in American cliff swallows (&quot;Petrochelidon pyrrhonota&quot;) if they are exposed to foraging workers. Songbird nest survival decreases in areas with red imported fire ants present, but survival rates in white-eyed vireo (&quot;Vireo griseus&quot;) and black-capped vireo (&quot;Vireo atricapilla&quot;) nests increase from 10% to 31% and 7% to 13% whenever fire ants are not present or when they are unable to attack them. Red imported fire ants may indirectly contribute to low brood survival in the Attwater&#x27;s prairie chicken. It was first thought that the ants were linked to the decline of overwintering birds such as the loggerhead shrike (&quot;Lanius ludovicianus&quot;), but a later study showed that ant eradication efforts using the pesticide Mirex, which was known to have toxic side effects, was largely to blame.

Red imported fire ants are strong competitors with many ant species. They have managed to displace many native ants which has led to a number of ecological consequences. However, studies show that these ants are not always superior competitors that suppress native ants. Habitat disturbance prior to their arrival, and recruitment limitations, are more plausible reasons why native ants are suppressed. Between &quot;Tapinoma melanocephalum&quot; and &quot;Pheidole fervida&quot;, the red imported fire ant is stronger than both species but shows different levels of aggression. For example, they are less hostile towards &quot;T. melanocephalum&quot; in contrast to &quot;P. fervida&quot;. Mortality rates in &quot;T. melanocephalum&quot; and &quot;P. fervida&quot; when fighting with red imported fire ants are high, being 31.8% and 49.9% respectively. The mortality rate for red imported fire ant workers, however, is only 0.2% to 12%. The imported crazy ant (&quot;Nylanderia fulva&quot;) exhibits greater dominance than the red imported fire ant and has been known to displace them in habitats where they encounter each other in. Larger colonies of pavement ants (&quot;Tetramorium caespitum)&quot; can destroy red imported fire ant colonies, leading entomologists to conclude that this conflict between the two species may help impede the spread of the red imported fire ant. Individuals infected by SINV-1 can be killed faster than healthy individuals by &quot;Monomorium chinense&quot;. This means that ants infected with SINV-1 are weaker than their healthy counterparts and more than likely will be eliminated by &quot;M. chinense&quot;. However, major workers, whether they are infected or not, are rarely killed.

In areas it is native to, the red imported fire ant is still a dominant species and coexists with 28 ant species in gallery forest gaps and ten species in xerophytic forest grassland, winning most aggressive interactions with other ants. However, some ants can be co-dominant in areas where they coexist such as the Argentine ant, where they compete symmetrically. Workers regularly engage in food competition with other ants, and can suppress the exploitation of food resources from honeydew-producing hemipterans (specifically from &quot;Phenacoccus solenopsis&quot;) from native ants; however, red imported fire ants are unable to eliminate &quot;T. melanocephalum&quot; completely although they consume a higher proportion of food. Instead, the two ants may peacefully coexist and share the honeydew. When encountering neighboring fire ants, workers may take on death-feigning behaviours to avoid them with success. However, such behaviour is only seen in young workers, as older workers either flee or fight back when threatened.

As mentioned, red imported fire ants and Argentine ants compete with each other. Mortality rates vary in different scenarios (i.e. mortality rates in colony confrontation is lower than those confronting each other in the field). Major workers can also withstand more injuries to their bodies, thus increasing the mortality rate of Argentine ants. For an Argentine ant colony to successfully wipe out a monogyne colony of 160,000 workers, the colony would need 396,800 workers. A colony that has reduced in size due to successful bait treatment are prone to predation by Argentine ants. The ants may play a vital role in removing weakened fire ant colonies, and they may also be important in slowing the spread of these fire ants, especially in heavily infested Argentine ant areas. Despite this, Argentine ant populations in the southeastern United States have declined following the introduction of the red imported fire ant.

Red imported fire ants may reduce butterfly numbers due to eggs and caterpillar predation and have been linked to butterfly species declines including Schaus swallowtails (&quot;Papilio aristodemus&quot;).

==== Mutualism ====
Red imported fire ants have formed a relationship with an invasive mealybug, &quot;Phenacoccus solenopsis&quot;. Colony growth is known to increase if ants have access to resources produced by &quot;P. solenopsis&quot;, and the population density of these mealybugs is significantly higher in areas where red imported fire ants are present (the spread of &quot;P. solenopsis&quot; in areas it is not native is attributed to the presence of the ants). As well as that, the life expectancy and reproductive rate of &quot;P. solenopsis&quot; both increase. These mealybugs may even be transported by workers back to their nest. Predation of &quot;P. solenopsis&quot; decreases due to tending workers interfering with the predation and parasitism by natural enemies. Mealybugs are preyed on by the lady beetle (&quot;Menochilus sexmaculatus&quot;) and are hosts of two parasites (&quot;Aenasius bambawalei&quot; and ) if there are no ants present, but this is different if ants are present. Lady beetles are less frequently seen on plants with red imported fire ants, and the rate of &quot;mummy&quot; nymphs is significantly lower. This is clearly evident as scientists observed that cotton aphid (&quot;Aphis gossypii&quot;) populations, and the predation of sentinel bollworm eggs, increased in areas with red imported fire ant presence. Red imported fire ants have developed a mutual relationship with another mealybug (&quot;Dysmicoccus morrisoni&quot;). The ants promote the colony growth of &quot;D. morrisoni&quot; through protection, covering the colonies up with debris and collecting the honeydew they secrete.

==Toxicology==
The toxicology of red imported fire ant venom has been relatively well studied. The venom is important to the ant, enabling it to capture its prey and to defend itself. Some 14 million people are stung annually in the United States, who may suffer reactions ranging from mild eczema to anaphylactic shock. Most common reactions to fire ant stings are a burning sensation at the sting site, followed by urticaria and pustule formation. Some victims may develop a more serious allergic reaction which can be life-threatening.
The venom is mainly composed of insoluble alkaloids with a minor watery phase containing some 46 proteins of which four are reported as allergens. Effective immunotherapy is available.

==Relationship with humans==

===As pests===
Because of their notoriety and invasive behavior, red imported fire ants are considered pests. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration estimates more than $5 billion is spent annually on medical treatment, damage, and control in infested areas. In Texas alone, red imported fire ants caused $300 million in damages for livestock, wildlife and public health. Approximately $36 per American household, and more than $250 million has been spent to control and eradicate red imported fire ants. Private agencies spend $25 to $40 million on pesticides annually. Unsuccessful eradication in Australia may cost the economy billions in damages annually and, based on a Queensland government study, the estimated cost could reach $43 billion over 30 years.

Red imported fire ants thrive in urban areas, especially in backyards, golf courses, parks, recreational areas, school grounds, and street verges, in which their presence may deter outdoor activities. If they enter homes or properties, they can harm pets if they are caged, penned, tied or cannot escape. Nests can be built under pavements or even roads, as well as under driveways, foundations, lawns, edges of sidewalks, under patio slabs, in electrical boxes or near power lines. A colony can excavate huge quantities of soil, resulting in structural problems in driveways, pavings and walls, and can also cause the formation of potholes in roads. Additional damage by mounds can be inflicted on trees, yard plants, and pipes; some structures may also collapse. Colonies may migrate into human homes after heavy rain to take refuge from saturated soil.

Not only do they thrive in urban areas, red imported fire ants can damage equipment and infrastructure and impact business, land, and property values. They are also attracted to electricity; electrically stimulated workers release venom alkaloids, alarm pheromones, and recruitment pheromones, which in return attracts more workers to the site. As a result, red imported fire ants can destroy electrical equipment. This is known as magnetism, where scientists have identified internal magnetic materials which may play a role in orientation behaviors. They are known to chew through electrical insulation which causes damage to electric motors, irrigation lines, pumps, signal boxes, transformers, telephone exchanges, and other equipment. Colonies aggregate near electrical fields and are capable of causing short circuits or interfering with switches and equipment such as air conditioners, computers, and water pumps. They are also known to infest airport landing areas and traffic lights.
In 2002, the farm gate value of decorative producing nurseries in Orange, Los Angeles, and San Diego counties was $1.3 billion. According to author Les Greenberg of the Center for Invasive Species Research, roughly 40% of crops are produced in these three counties, making it one of the major crops in these areas. “The value of California&#x27;s entire nursery industry in 2002 was estimated at $2.6 billion” (Greenberg, 1). This business is already feeling the effects of quarantine laws that need pesticide soaking before imports can begin. Immediate costs include the spraying of insecticides to all plants in restricted zones.

===In agriculture===
The red imported fire ant is a significant agricultural pest in areas where it is not native. They are capable of damaging crops, and they threaten pastures and orchards. The mounds themselves can destroy agricultural equipment such as irrigation systems and damage machinery during harvest time. The ants are known to invade soybean crops causing lower yields, and could cause $156 million in losses for soybean crops in the southeastern United States. Reports from Georgia and North Carolina claim that 16.8 to 49.1 kg/ha of soybeans could not be harvested due to interference from fire ant mounds; combine harvesters skipped over the mounds preventing the crops from being harvested, and farmers raised the cutter bars on their combine harvesters to avoid impacting the mounds. The feeding behaviour of red imported fire ants can result in significant damage to many other crops, including: beans, cabbage, citrus, corn, cucumber, eggplant, okra, peanut, potato, sorghum, sunflower, and sweet potato. The ants also interfere with plants&#x27; root systems and feed on young growth. Sometimes, colonies build mounds around or near the base of citrus trees chew off new growth and feed on the flowers or developing fruit. Citrus trees are often girdled or killed.

Despite its pest status and notoriety, the red imported fire ant can be beneficial. The ant is an effective insect predator, so it may serve as a biological agent against other pest species, especially in sugarcane fields. Pest insects the ant kills include: boll weevils (&quot;Anthonomus grandis&quot;) in cotton crops, sugarcane borers (&quot;Diatraea saccharalis&quot;) in sugarcane fields, horn flies (&quot;Haematobia irritans&quot;) in manure, velvetbean caterpillars (&quot;Anticarsia gemmatalis&quot;) in soybeans, and whiteflies that are found in greenhouses. A number of studies indicate that red imported fire ants do not interfere or attack insects of economic importance in cotton fields, which has resulted in many farmers in the southeastern regions of the United States viewing red imported fire ants as beneficial. However, some scientists have suggested that the beneficial status of the red imported fire ant is hard to predict when geography, plant size, season, soil moisture and the use of insecticides are not considered. These factors may lower the efficacy of red imported fire ants as pest control agents. Another factor is that workers are indiscriminate and kill beneficial insects such as predators that eat horn flies and other pests in pastures and predators of aphids and scale insects. They also reduce the efficacy of parasitic wasps against pest species by eating the larvae and pupae.

===Control===
In comparison to other ant species like &quot;Anoplolepis gracilipes&quot;, which rapidly take over areas they have been contained in, red imported fire ants are fairly easy to control. The first proposals to controlling the ant occurred in 1957 when the United States Congress authorised an eradication program using federal and state funding. Research on the ant and its biology has been continuous after the establishment of an eradication program, and many chemicals were used to eliminate them. However, scientists discovered that these insecticides were killing native fauna, and the Environmental Protection Agency subsequently outlawed them. Some scientists even questioned whether the ants were pests or not. Today, it is unlikely that the red imported fire ant will be eradicated in areas such as the United States. Populations can be managed properly if an integrated approach is used. Some scientists have considered using the ants&#x27; natural enemies against it; this includes &quot;Kneallhazia solenopsae&quot; and &quot;B. bassiana&quot;. Phorid flies have also been viewed as potential biological agents, as they can reduce foraging activity in red imported fire ants and affect population levels. However, they are unable to affect colony growth rate. In addition, parasitic ants, parasitic wasps, mites, other pathogens, nematodes, and fungi have been considered to be potential biological agents. Others suggest that populations can be maintained or reduced by manipulating several ecological factors.

Several baits have been used to control populations. Mounds are destroyed in a matter of weeks if baits are used on them. Baits are considered to be effective and simple to use against red imported fire ants, in comparison to drenching, dusting, or fumigating. They are sprinkled onto the mound then the ants take and consume them. Certain baits such as growth regulator baits, and boric acid-sucrose water baits, benefit native fauna and low concentrations are usually required to kill a colony. Others baits used against red imported fire ants include Amdro, Ascend, hydramethylnon, indoxacarb, and Maxforce.

Solid and liquid bait insecticides, if improperly applied in a location, may be moved through waterflow in to waterways. As snow melts and rainfall moves over and through the ground, the water picks up improperly applied insecticides and deposits them in to larger bodies of water such as rivers and wetlands, or percolates in to watersheds.

Researchers have also been experimenting with other methods, such as fumigation, injecting the mound, mound drenching, and surface dusting. Mound drenching entails pouring large volumes of toxic liquid into the mound. While this may affect a large portion of the mound, it is possible it may not reach the queen, thus preventing the destruction of the colony. Surface dusting is similar to mound drenching, except insecticides are applied on top of the mound and soak into the soil when wet. Mound injections use pressurising and injecting insecticides into the mound, but the queen may not be affected by this. Mounds can be eliminated effectively through fumigation. Broadcast treatment is sometimes used by spraying infected areas with agricultural equipment. Finally, spot treatment with insecticides can be used by drilling and injecting the mound with residual insecticide.

Aside from chemical control, other methods that can be employed against these ants include mechanical and electrical devices. However, it is unknown whether or not these devices are effective. Ant-proofing can be effective against colonies nesting inside buildings by caulking and sealing cracks, which successfully suppresses the population outside the walls. Homeowners have used their own methods to remove mounds by pouring boiling water on them or igniting them with flammable liquids. Although these methods may be effective, they are not recommended because they can be harmful to humans and the environment.

<doc id="377250" wikidata="Q3118196" url="?curid=377250" title="Grumman LLV">
<text>The Grumman Long Life Vehicle (LLV) is an American light transport truck model designed as a mail truck for the United States Postal Service, which has been its primary user since it first entered service in 1986, 39 years ago. It was also used by Canada Post. The LLV uses a chassis built by General Motors based on its Chevrolet S-10 with an aluminum body built by Grumman.

In 2021, after a long competition, the USPS announced it had awarded a $6 billion contract to Oshkosh Defense to produce the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle, which will replace the LLV. In February 2023, the USPS announced the purchase of 9,250 each of stock Ford E-Transit vans and Stellantis gasoline-powered vans. , the first custom NGDVs were scheduled to enter service in June 2024, nine months after the original October 2023 target date.

==History==
In the United States, the Grumman LLV is the most common vehicle used by letter carriers for curbside and residential delivery of mail, replacing the previous standard letter-carrier vehicle, the Jeep DJ-5. Curbside delivery from a driver seated in a vehicle to a curbside mailbox is sometimes termed &quot;mounted delivery&quot;, in contrast to walking delivery.

The Grumman LLV was the first vehicle specifically designed for the United States Postal Service (USPS); the USPS provided a specification and three teams created prototypes that were tested in Laredo, Texas, in 1985: Grumman in partnership with General Motors, Poveco (a joint venture of Fruehauf and General Automotive Corporation), and American Motors Corporation. The main design points of the vehicle in contract competition were serviceability, handling in confined areas, and overall economical operation. Prototypes were each subjected to a road test, including frequent starts and stops, gravel surfaces, cobblestones and potholes, hauling a payload of up to .

Previously, Grumman had built a limited number of KurbWatts, a battery electric vehicle with an aluminum delivery van body, which was tested by the USPS in the early 1980s. At about the same time, Grumman also built 500 KubVans, which used a similar lightweight aluminum delivery body on a Volkswagen Pickup diesel chassis and also underwent testing by the USPS. These designs influenced Grumman&#x27;s candidate body design for the LLV. Grumman won the competition and was awarded a $1.1 billion contract to produce 99,150 LLVs in April 1986; USPS also held an option for an additional 54,000 LLVs.

===Production===
The vehicles were assembled by the Allied Division of Grumman in Clinton Township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. The first vehicle was completed in April 1986. At peak production, 95 LLVs were completed each day, at a rate of approximately one every five minutes. Grumman invested $28 million into the factory, doubling its size to and increasing the workforce from 250 to 600.

The USPS purchased more than 100,000 of these vehicles, the last one in 1994. As its name suggests, the Grumman LLV is easily capable of a long life. The required lifespan specified by the U.S. Postal Service was 24 years, but in 2009, this was extended to 30 years. The Grumman LLV can easily last over 200,000 miles on its original engine and transmission before needing an overhaul.
The USPS acquired 21,000 Ford–Utilimaster FFVs in 2000 and 2001 to supplement the LLV fleet. The FFVs have a similar aluminum body and also are right-hand drive, but ride on a chassis built by Ford Motor Company with a body built by Utilimaster.

In 2010, approximately 140,000 LLVs remained in the USPS delivery fleet; retirement and attrition had reduced that to 126,000 by 2021. A number were also sold to Canada, Mexico, and several other countries.

==Technical description==
Like the older postal-service Jeep DJ-5, the Grumman LLV features a right-hand-drive (RHD) configuration, in contrast to the typical left-hand-drive (LHD) position of vehicles in North America. It also features a large metal tray, which is able to hold three trays of letter mail, mounted where a passenger seat would normally be. This arrangement positions the driver on the side of the vehicle closest to the curb, enabling the carrier to easily grab sorted mail and place it into mailboxes without having to leave the seat. Other notable features are an exceptionally tight turning radius and a low-geared, three-speed transmission for hauling heavy cargo. The LLV has a cargo capacity, double what the Jeep DJ-5 could hold.

The body and final assembly is by Grumman, and the chassis is made by General Motors, based on the 1982 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer, powered by GM engines including the 2.5-liter inline-four TBI &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and, in later production, 2.2-liter inline-four SPFI &quot;LN2&quot;; the instrument cluster and front suspension are similar to those used in the Chevrolet S-10 pickup and S-10 Blazer sport utility vehicle.

The LLV has a unique footprint. The front wheels (taken from the two-wheel-drive S-10 Blazer model) have narrower spacing than the rear wheels (using the rear axle from the four-wheel-drive S-10 Blazer model). The front of the vehicle also has low ground clearance. While this has advantages, there are some trade offs. The vehicle was tested successfully in warmer climates, but when used in places with substantial snowfall, they became difficult to control and were poorly adapted to those conditions.

The Grumman LLV&#x27;s estimated average combined EPA fuel economy is [ on the city/highway cycles, respectively]. In actual use by the USPS, which includes extensive stop-and-go driving for residential delivery, average fuel economy is about .

Like other U.S. Postal Service vehicles before it, the Grumman LLV does not carry a license plate and instead uses a seven-digit U.S. Postal Service serial number, usually starting with 020, 021, 120, 125, 126, 220, 221, 330, 331, 430, 431, 720, 820, 821, 920, or 921. The first digit of the serial number represents the last digit of the year in which it was made, ranging from 7 (1987) to 4 (1994). The USPS does not permit reselling LLVs, so when they are retired, they are scrapped for parts; however, at least one was sold by the State of Georgia at auction in 2013.

===Commercial version===
Grumman also planned to market a commercial variant of the LLV with right-hand drive as the CLLV through Chevrolet. The CLLV was essentially the same as the LLV, with the same chassis, built by GM at Moraine Assembly using S-10 components, driven by the 2.5L &quot;Iron Duke&quot; through a 3-speed automatic transmission and a 7-&quot; positraction rear differential with 3.42:1 final drive ratio. The CLLV was rated to carry a payload of , including the driver, and could accommodate up to of cargo.

===Electric versions===
Ten LLVs were converted in 1995, 1997, and 1999 for a pilot program, adding a battery electric drivetrain developed by GM Hughes and U.S. Electricar. They used lead-acid battery chemistry. The resulting Electric Long Life Vehicles (ELLVs) were deployed to post offices in Harbor City, California (in Los Angeles); Westminster, California; and Merrifield, Virginia. When GM canceled its electric vehicle program, the vehicles were taken out of service at the end of 2000.

At about the same time, Transport Canada commissioned Solectria Corporation in November 1998 to convert two LLVs to battery-electric; they were delivered to Canada Post in February 1999. The performance report, comparing the converted LLV to a conventional LLV, was published in February 2000. The Solectria/Grumman LLV was equipped with a lead-acid traction battery and diesel-fired heater, giving it a nominal range of . The traction motor was an AC induction type, with a peak output of and continuous rated output of . Testing showed the typical consumption on a postal driving cycle was at an ambient temperature of , giving a range of ; these figures improved to consumption and range at . By comparison, the conventionally-powered LLV on the same driving cycle returned fuel consumption of at and at .

This was followed by a larger fleet test, consisting of 500 Electric Carrier Route Vehicles (ECRV) from 2000 to 2003. The ECRV was equipped with a body similar to the LLV, built by Grumman/Allied on a RHD Ford Ranger EV chassis. Most were tested in California, with the remainder tested in Washington, D.C., and White Plains, New York. Southern California Edison tested six prototype ECRVs at the Electric Vehicle Technical Center (EVTC) in Pomona, California. The ECRV uses a AC induction traction motor driving the rear wheels, drawing power from a lead-acid battery consisting of 39 modules at 8 volts each, connected in series. It has a curb weight of and a payload of ; the estimated driving range is and the maximum speed is . Testing at EVTC showed the ECRV met or exceeded its performance requirements, including an accelerated reliability test. Real-world testing at the Fountain Valley, California, post office during July and August demonstrated the average route covered , consuming an average of 41% of the battery state of charge. After Ford announced they were also canceling their electric vehicle program in October 2002, the battery manufacturer (East Penn Manufacturing Company) offered to sell replacement traction batteries for the ECRVs to be held in cold storage as experience showed the batteries would need to be replaced after two years of service. The USPS instead traded the ECRVs in August 2003 back to Ford in exchange for Windstar minivans.

A second round of testing five converted all-electric LLVs began in 2011. Each second-generation eLLV was converted by a different group, funded by the USPS through a $50,000 grant to each electromodder, and tested in Washington, D.C. In the nine-month period from March to December 2011, the five vehicles had taken an aggregated 9,181 trips and traveled a total distance of , consuming an average of of AC power (from the wall). By March 2014, only one of the modified eLLVs (from ZAP) remained in service.
;Notes
==Replacements==
Because the United States Postal Service owns more than 100,000 Grumman LLVs, of which most have reached the end of their lifespan, the USPS has been preparing to replace the LLVs. In fiscal year 2009, the USPS spent $524 million to repair and retrofit its fleet of Grumman LLVs, and estimated that it would cost $4.2 billion to replace the entire fleet. By 2021, it was estimated that each LLV required maintenance costing more than $5,000 per year; the all-aluminum body had proven to be robust and corrosion-resistant, but the chassis frame and powertrain components had required reverse-engineering as the original designs were out of production.

The LLVs also suffer from several design deficiencies, including inadequate cabin climate controls (no air conditioning and a heater prone to breaking down). The wheels and suspension are not suited for the all-terrain and all-weather needs of delivering mail and require snow chains during inclement weather. Also, because the windshield washer fluid line is routed above the fusebox, LLVs are prone to catching fire; between 2015 and 2019, over 120 fires occurred. According to documents obtained in 2020 via a Freedom of Information Act request as part of a Vice Media investigation, 407 LLVs have been damaged or destroyed since May 2014.

In some areas, LLVs have been supplemented or replaced with vans and minivans, including the 2008–2010 purchase of Dodge Grand Caravan and Chevrolet Uplander minivans, which tend to be more comfortable for postal workers, especially in extreme climates. The United States Postal Service has announced it would purchase 7,160 Ram ProMaster (to replace Caravan and Uplander vehicles) and up to 30,608 right-hand-drive Mercedes-Benz Metris vehicles as part of the Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) vehicle program announced on August 3, 2018, to replace and upgrade its fleet of delivery vehicles.

In 2014, the USPS reviewed options for replacement. The Office of Inspector General found that the Postal Service&#x27;s acquisition plan for replacements lacked details and while the USPS could continue deliveries until 2017, there were concerns over the aging vehicles.

Canada Post also adopted the Grumman LLV, but around 2008, it began studying whether to refurbish, upgrade, or replace its fleet. On March 18, 2010, Canada Post and Ford Motor Company announced that Canada Post would purchase a fleet of Transit Connect vans.

===Next Generation Delivery Vehicle===

On January 20, 2015, the USPS released solicitation RFI-NGDV for the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle. Potential bidders had until March 5, 2015, to submit comments and pre-qualification responses. The USPS was to then select companies to receive the RFP for prototype development. On February 13, 2015, it was announced that General Motors was actively pursuing this new contract, which would have them provide the USPS with 180,000 new vehicles at a cost of at least $5 billion. On September 22, 2016, the United States Postal Service awarded the NGDV Prototype Contract to six selected suppliers: AM General, Karsan, Mahindra, Oshkosh, Utilimaster, and a joint-venture bid involving Workhorse and VT Hackney. Half of the prototypes would feature hybrid and new technologies, including alternative fuel capabilities. The prototypes would represent a variety of vehicle sizes and drive configurations, in addition to advanced power trains and a range of hybrid technologies.

On February 23, 2021, USPS announced that Oshkosh Defense was awarded the contract for design and manufacture of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV) to replace the LLV and FFV, delivering up to 165,000 vehicles over a ten-year period.

<doc id="377251" wikidata="Q712674" url="?curid=377251" title="Raymond II, Count of Tripoli">
<text>Raymond II (; 1116 – 1152) was count of Tripoli from 1137 to 1152. He succeeded his father, Pons, who was killed during a campaign that a commander from Damascus launched against Tripoli. Raymond accused the local Christians of betraying his father and invaded their villages in the Mount Lebanon area. He also had many of them tortured and executed. Raymond was captured during an invasion by Imad ad-Din Zengi, atabeg of Mosul, who gained the two important castles of Montferrand (at present-day Baarin in Syria) and Rafaniya in exchange for his release in the summer of 1137.

Since his army proved unable to secure the defence of the eastern borders of his county, Raymond granted several forts to the Knights Hospitaller in 1142. The sudden death of his father&#x27;s uncle, Alfonso Jordan, count of Toulouse, during the Second Crusade gave rise to gossip which suggested that Raymond had poisoned him because Alfonso Jordan had allegedly wanted to lay claim to Tripoli. Alfonso Jordan&#x27;s illegitimate son, Bertrand, actually seized the fortress of Areimeh in the County of Tripoli in 1149, but Raymond recaptured it with the assistance of Muslim rulers. Raymond ceded the castle to the Knights Templar.

The marriage of Raymond and his wife, Hodierna, was unhappy. Her sister, Queen Melisende of Jerusalem, came to Tripoli to put an end to their conflict. Hodierna preferred to leave Tripoli for Jerusalem along with her sister and Raymond escorted them for a short distance. On his way back to Tripoli, a group of Assassins stabbed him at the southern gate of the town. He was the first Christian ruler to be murdered by Assassins.

==Early life==

Raymond was the elder son of Pons, Count of Tripoli, and Cecile of France. The date of his birth is unknown, but William of Tyre noted that Raymond was &quot;adolescent&quot; when his father died, implying that he was at least fifteen in 1137. He and his younger brother, Philip, were mature enough to sign their father&#x27;s charters in the early 1130s. Historian Kevin J. Lewis argues that Raymond &quot;could easily have been in his early twenties&quot; in 1137, suggesting that he was born around 1116. Lewis also states that Raymond was most probably betrothed to Hodierna, a younger daughter of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem, &quot;as early as 1127&quot;.

==Reign==

===War with Muslim powers===

Bazwāj, the mamluk (or slave) commander of Damascus made a raid against Tripoli and defeated Pons in a battle. Pons fled from the battlefield, but native Christians captured and handed him over to Bazwāj who had him executed on 25 March 1137. Bazwāj captured a frontier fort but returned to Damascus without attacking Tripoli. To take vengeance for his father&#x27;s death, Raymond invaded the local Christians&#x27; settlements in the Mount Lebanon area and captured many of them. The captured men, women and children were taken to Tripoli where the majority were tortured and executed. William of Tyre remarked that Raymond&#x27;s campaign against the local Christians provided &quot;the first lessons of his martial courage&quot;.

After learning of Pons&#x27; death, Zengi invaded Tripoli in July 1137. A Muslim historian, Kamal al-Din, would later claim that Zengi attacked Tripoli only after Raymond mustered his troops to force Zengi to lift the siege of Homs. Lewis emphasizes that Kamal al-Din&#x27;s report is doubtful, because Bazwāj had almost annihilated the army of Tripoli, preventing Raymond from launching major campaigns. After Zengi laid siege to Montferrand, Raymond sent envoys to King Fulk of Jerusalem, his maternal uncle and brother-in-law, urging him to hurry to the besieged fortress. Shortly after Fulk and his army crossed the frontier of the County of Tripoli, the envoys of Raymond of Poitiers, prince of Antioch, informed him that the Byzantine Emperor John II Komnenos had invaded Antioch.

Fulk and Raymond of Tripoli decided to launch an assault on Zengi&#x27;s forces before marching to Antioch, because they thought they could easily defeat the atabeg. However, Zengi lifted the siege of Homs and made an unexpected attack on the united forces of Jerusalem and Tripoli. Thousands of Christian soldiers were killed during the battle, and even more (including Raymond) were captured; Fulk and his retinue fled to Montferrand. Zengi again besieged Montferrand, but began negotiations with the besieged when he heard that further relief was on its way from Raymond of Poitiers, Joscelin II of Edessa, and Emperor John II Komnenos. Those besieged in the fortress did not know of these movements but readily agreed to hand over the castle to Zengi in exchange for a safe passage and the release of Raymond and all other Christian captives.

===Attempts to consolidate===

The Byzantine author, Theodore Prodromos, praised John II Komnenos for having made Tripoli subject shortly after 1137. Decades later the Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates would also describe Raymond as a liegeman (vassal) of John II Komnenos. Both sources suggest that Raymond renewed his predecessors&#x27; oath of loyalty towards the Byzantine emperor, according to Lewis. Nevertheless, Raymond did not participate in John II Komnenos&#x27; military campaign against the Muslim rulers of Northern Syria in 1138. Historian Ralph-Johannes Lilie says the lack of sufficient military forces prevented Raymond from assisting the Byzantines.

Raymond granted several settlements to the Knights Hospitallers along the eastern borders of his county in 1142. His grant included &quot;the fortress of the Kurds&quot; which developed into the important Crusader castle of Krak des Chevaliers during the following decades. He also transferred his rights to Montferrand and Rafaniya, both seized by Zengi in 1137, to the Hospitallers if they could recapture them. When establishing a military order on the eastern borderland, Raymond only wanted to secure the defence of his county, but his magnanimous grant laid the foundation of an almost independent ecclesiastic state.

===Family affairs===

Raymond was a great-grandson of Raymond of Saint-Gilles, one of the leaders of the First Crusade who was the first to style himself as count of Tripoli (even before Tripoli had been captured). However, Raymond was descended from Saint-Gilles through Bertrand of Toulouse, a son with disputed legitimacy. Saint-Gilles&#x27; legitimate son, Alfonso-Jordan, was born after Saint-Gilles started to use the title of count of Tripoli, making him his father&#x27;s lawful heir in accordance with the idea of porphyrogeniture.

Alfonso-Jordan was one of the supreme commanders of the Second Crusade, but he died shortly after he landed at the Holy Land in April 1148. Because of his unexpected death, gossip about his murder started spreading among the Crusaders, although he most probably died of natural causes, as a consequence of his lengthy voyage across the Mediterranean Sea. An anonymous Syrian chronicler accused Raymond of the crime, stating that he poisoned Alfonso-Jordan because he feared that his uncle had come to seize Tripoli. Lewis emphasizes, the chronicle &quot;is hardly the most reliable piece of evidence, so some skepticism about Raymond&#x27;s involvement in Alfons&#x27;s death is surely advisible&quot;. Another contemporaneous authorthe continuator of Sigebert of Gembloux&#x27;s chroniclewas convinced that Raymond&#x27;s sister-in-law Queen Melisende of Jerusalem had poisoned Alfons-Jordan because she wanted to prevent him from claiming Tripoli.

Raymond did not attend the assembly of the leaders of the crusade at Acre on 24 June 1148. He also kept away from the Crusaders&#x27; siege of Damascus in 1148. In contrast with Raymond, Alfons-Jordan&#x27;s illegitimate son, Bertrand, who had arrived in his father&#x27;s retinue, participated in the Crusaders&#x27; fights. He decided to lay claim to Tripoli and took possession of the fortress of Areimeh in the summer of 1149. After being unable to expel Bertrand from the fort which controlled important roads in the county, Raymond sought assistance from Mu&#x27;in ad-Din Unur, the Muslim ruler of Damascus, as well as from Zengi&#x27;s son, Nur ad-Din. The two Muslim rulers captured Areimeh and imprisoned Bertrand and his family. After destroying the castle, they returned the territory to Raymond. Raymond granted the land to the Knights Templar in the early 1150s.

===Last years===

King Baldwin III of Jerusalem crossed Tripoli during his march towards northern Syria in the summer of 1150. He wanted to meet with the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos who had purchased the last fortresses of the County of Edessa. Because of a conflict between Baldwin and his mother, Melisende, her supporters had refused to accompany the king, who thus asked Raymond to join him. Raymond agreed and accompanied Baldwin to the meeting and they jointly supervised the transfer of the castles to the Byzantines.

A Fatimid fleet pillaged Tripoli during a plundering raid against the coastal towns in the summer of 1151. The Egyptians destroyed ships and killed or captured hundreds of people in the harbour. In December, Crusader troops invaded the Beqaa Valley, seizing prisoners and booty during their campaign before the Muslim governor of Baalbek routed them. Nur ad-Din broke into the county in April or May 1152 and captured Tortosa, leaving a garrison there. Baldwin III came to Tripoli and held a &quot;general court&quot;, attended by the leading barons of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli. After the king&#x27;s arrival, the Nur ad-Din&#x27;s troops left Tortosa, but they destroyed the fortress. Since its restoration proved costly, Raymond ceded Tortosa first to the local bishop, then to the Templars who transformed it into one of their most important headquarters.

An &quot;enmity born from marital jealousy&quot; had meanwhile emerged between Raymond and his wife, according to William of Tyre. Her sister, Melisende, who attended the assembly at Tripoli, tried to mediate between them, but their relationship remained tense. After the assembly was closed, Melisende and Hodierna left Tripoli for Jerusalem. Raymond rode out with them for a short distance, and on his way back to Tripoli, he was killed by a group of Assassinsfanatics employed by the head of the Nizari to murder their enemiesat the southern gate to the city, along with two of his knights. The motivation of the crime is unknown. Since the Nizari had not previously killed Christian rulers, modern historians propose that the establishment of the Templars at Tortosa had outraged them.

==Family==






The exact date of the marriage of Raymond and Hodierna is unknown. According to historian Peter Lock, it took place in the spring of 1133, after her brother-in-law, Fulk of Jerusalem, provided military assistance to Raymond&#x27;s father against Zengi. Raymond and Hodierna&#x27;s son, Raymond III, was born only in 1140, thus he was still a minor when he succeeded his father in 1152. Raymond and Hodierna&#x27;s daughter, Melisende, was famed for her beauty, but her delicate health and rumours about her mother&#x27;s possible infidelity prevented her marriage to the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos.

<text>The Communist Party of Nepal (), abbreviated CPN, was a communist party in Nepal from 1949 to 1962. It was founded on 15 September 1949 to struggle against the autocratic Rana regime, feudalism, and imperialism. The founding general secretary was Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The founding members of the Communist Party of Nepal were Moti Devi Shrestha, Niranjan Govinda Vaidya, Nar Bahadur Karmacharya and Narayan Bilas Joshi.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years, 1949–1951 ===

The party was formed by Pushpa Lal Shrestha, a former member of the Nepali National Congress, who had grown disillusioned with the infighting in the party and the willingness to cooperate and make concessions with the Ranas. After his resignation from the Nepali National Congress–which would later become the Nepali Congress–he had been inspired by Marxist literary criticism and in April 1949 published a translated version of &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; in the Nepali language. There were initial plans to work within the Nepali National Congress as a leftist group or organize as a workers-peasants party but this was eventually scrapped.

Shrestha who was in Kolkata at the time joined the &quot;Marxist Study Circle&quot; in Campbell Medical School. Keshar Jung Rayamajhi who was studying at Campbell and Man Mohan Adhikari who was studying in Benaras at the time were also members of the group. On 22 April 1949, Pushpa Lal became the secretary of an organizing committee which was to become the Communist Party of Nepal. The members of the organizing committee at the time were Moti Devi Shrestha, Niranjan Govinda Vaidya, Nar Bahadur Karmacharya and Narayan Bilas Joshi.

The Central Organising Committee of the CPN published the first issue of the &quot;Communist Pachhik Prachar Patra&quot; on 15 September 1949 as the manifesto of the CPN. The date was symbolic as exactly one hundred and three years ago Jang Bahadur Rana had started the Rana regime in Nepal after orchestrating the Kot massacre. The first central committee of the CPN did not include any other members of the original organizing committee except for Shrestha. The members of the first central committee were Man Mohan Adhikari, Tulsi Lal Amatya, Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, D.P. Adhikari and Communist Party of India member Ayodhya Singh.

The CPN played an important role in the 1951 uprising that overthrew the Rana regime. The party was one of the constituents of the United Democratic Front along with smaller communist and leftist groups. The UDF organized civil disobedience movements and also demanded the release of political prisoners.

=== Ban, 1952–1954 ===
On 8 June 1952, the Kisan Sangh (Farmer&#x27;s Union), the farmers-wing of the CPN, declared a revolt against landlords and demanded that land be distributed to landless peasants. Earlier in the year in January, a coup was attempted by the Rakshya Dal under the leadership of Kunwar Inderjit Singh. The party had occupied the airfield, radio station, the post and the telegraph office at Singha Durbar. They had demanded that an all-party government be formed that included the Communists but excluded the far-right Nepal Rashtrabadi Gorkha Parishad. The military intervened and Singh was arrested. As a consequence of this event, the CPN was banned on 24 January 1952.

The party contested the 1953 Kathmandu municipal election as independents and won half of the votes and six seats to the nineteen-member council. Janak Man Singh from the party was elected as the first elected mayor of Kathmandu. In the end of 1955, the party organized the Rastriya Janamorcha (National People&#x27;s Front) under the leadership of general secretary Keshar Jung Rayamajhi.

=== First general convention, 1954–1958 ===

In 1954, the first party congress was held clandestinely in Patan, Lalitpur. Man Mohan Adhikari was elected as the party&#x27;s general secretary, the party also approved a programme to replace monarchism with a republican system framed by an elected constituent assembly.

In 1956, when the Tanka Prasad Acharya-led government became an ally of the Communist Party of Nepal, the party had to accept constitutional monarchy as a condition to lift the ban on the party. In April 1956, the ban on the party was lifted. The party was also considered to be relatively tamed at this point as the leadership had displayed a level of deference towards the monarchy that most communist movements did not. In 1957, the second party congress was held in Kathmandu. For the first time, the party could hold its congress openly, and Keshar Jung Rayamajhi was elected general secretary.

=== First elections and royal coup, 1959–1961 ===

The party contested the 1959 Nepalese general election and won four seats to the first House of Representative. Tulsi Lal Amatya was elected as the party&#x27;s parliamentary party leader in the House of Representatives. CPN also had one member in the Senate (the upper house at the time) when Sambhu Ram Shrestha was elected in 1959. When King Mahendra took power and started his own direct rule, two major blocks developed in the party. The block led by Keshar Jung Rayamajhi supported the royal coup and the other block led by Tulsi Lal Amatya called for a united struggle against the coup. Rayamajhi&#x27;s position prompted Ajoy Ghosh, leader of the Communist Party of India to advice Rayamjhi to rectify his positions and retain the struggle against the monarchy. In early 1961, all political parties were banned. A wave of repression against CPN was initiated by the government. Rayamajhi had expressed certain faith in the politics of the monarch, something that provoked stern reaction from other sectors of the party.

To resolve the conflict a central plenum was convened in Darbhanga, India as all political gatherings in Nepal had been banned by royal decree. The plenum unanimously passed the line of armed struggle that was proposed by Pushpa Lal. Three lines had now emerged in the party, that of a pro-constitutional monarchy line led by Rayamajhi, a line that wanted to restore the dissolved parliament and launch broad mass movements led by Pushpa Lal, and a third line which favoured a constitutional assembly led by Mohan Bikram Singh. The latter line emerged victorious, but its sole representative in the Central Committee was Singh.

=== Split and dissolution, 1962 ===

In April 1962, one section of the party convened the third party congress in Varanasi, India. The congress approved the programme of National Democratic Revolution proposed by Tulsi Lal Amatya. Amatya was also elected as the general secretary. Pushpa Lal was in the capital at the time of the congress but had supported the decision. The congress also decided to expel Rayamajhi who supported the monarchy, but the faction led by Rayamajhi, who controlled the Central Committee, did not recognize this congress as legitimate. The party then split into the Communist Party of Nepal (Amatya) and Communist Party of Nepal (Rayamjhi).

== Ideology ==
The main objective of the Communist Party of Nepal in the 1950s was to transform Nepal into a republic, later on during the decade the party adopted Leninist principles of class struggle against the urban centered and the elite oriented. The party was also critical of the Nepali Congress, which was considered close to the ruling Indian National Congress. The party had opposed what it called cultural imperialism of India.

<text>The General Atomics Gnat is an aerial reconnaissance UAV developed in the United States in the late 1980s and manufactured by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI). As initially designed, it was a simplified version of the LSI Amber intended for foreign sales. The Gnat 750 made its first flight in 1989.

==Design and development==
The Gnat 750&#x27;s configuration was similar to that of the Amber, except that the Gnat 750&#x27;s wing was mounted low on the fuselage, instead of being mounted on a pylon on top. The Gnat 750 was somewhat larger than the Amber, but weighed less and could carry a heavier payload. The original name of the developing company before its acquisition by General Atomics was Leading Systems Incorporated (LSI).

The aircraft is powered by a Rotax 912 piston flat-four four-cycle engine with 64 kW (85 hp). It can fly to an operational area from 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) away and loiter there for 12 hours before returning home.

Eight Gnat 750s were in development when General Atomics bought out LSI. General Atomics continued the program, which led to a contract from the Turkish government for a number of the UAVs in 1993. The Turkish Air Force operates 6 Gnat-750 and 16 I-Gnat ER unmanned aerial vehicles.

By this time, the breakup of the old Communist states of Eastern Europe was in full swing, and the United States government wanted to obtain an intelligence asset to help it deal with trouble spots in the region, specifically the former Yugoslavia. A contract was issued to General Atomics for Gnat 750s with minor modifications. The aircraft were to be operated by the CIA.

The program encountered a number of difficulties, much of them due to bureaucratic factionalism and squabbling. One aircraft crashed during tests when it was hit by a gust of wind, causing it to indicate zero airspeed. The UAV&#x27;s software decided that meant it had landed and shut down the engine, causing the Gnat to fall to earth.

The Gnat 750 effort squeaked through, and in early 1994 the CIA sent a team equipped with a Gnat 750 to Albania to monitor events in the former Yugoslavia. The operation was not a success. The aircraft suffered from a number of bugs and was limited by bad weather, and the team was finally withdrawn. However, the Gnat 750 continued to be built, leading to an &quot;Improved Gnat&quot; or &quot;I-Gnat&quot; variant, with a turbocharged engine and general overall refinements to increase reliability, reduce maintenance, and enhance capability. The Gnat 750 also led to a next-generation derivative, the &quot;Gnat 750-45&quot;, much better known as the Predator.

===Prowler===
General Atomics also used the Gnat 750 as the basis for a tactical UAV known as the &quot;Prowler&quot;. It appears similar to a Gnat 750, but is smaller, with a wingspan of 7.31 meters (24 ft) and a length of 4.24 meters (13.9 ft). It has an endurance of over 16 hours, and some commonality with Gnat 750 subsystems.

==Operators==
* Turkish Air Force: used to operate 22 units. (Former operator, replaced by TAI Anka)
* Central Intelligence Agency: operated Gnat 750 to monitor activity in Albania and Yugoslavia

==Aircraft on display==
* 11 – Gnat 750 on static display at the Estrella Warbirds Museum in Paso Robles, California.

<text>I Am Canadian was the slogan of Molson Canadian beer from 1994 until 1999 (via ad agencies Maclaren Lintas, then MacLaren McCann), and between 2000 and 2005 (by Bensimon Byrne). It was also the subject of a popular ad campaign centred on Canadian patriotism and nationalism, the most famous examples of which are &quot;The Rant&quot; and &quot;The Anthem&quot;. The ads aired in both English Canada and the United States. In 2005, shortly after Molson&#x27;s merger with American brewer Coors, it announced it was retiring the &quot;I Am Canadian&quot; campaign. In 2017, Molson&#x27;s &quot;red beer fridge&quot; ad, created in 2013 for its &quot;I Am Canadian&quot; campaign, had a resurgence in social media in response to the United States Trump travel ban. In 2025, &quot;The Rant&quot; ad created in 2000 experienced a resurgence in social media as Canadian patriotism heightened during the trade war with the United States.

== &quot;The Rant&quot; ==
In March 2000, using nationalism as a platform, the ad starred a man named Joe: an average Canadian, standing in a movie theatre, with a cinema screen behind him showing different images relating to Canadian culture. Joe proceeds to give a speech about what is it to be a Canadian and what it is not to be a Canadian, making particular efforts to distinguish himself both from common Canadian stereotypes of Americans (&quot;I believe in peacekeeping, not policing&quot;) and common American stereotypes of Canadians (&quot;I don&#x27;t live in an igloo,&quot; &quot;I say &#x27;about,&#x27; not &#x27;aboot&#x27;&quot;).

It was performed by Nova Scotian/Canadian actor Jeff Douglas and directed by an American, Kevin Donovan, but written by a Canadian, Glen Hunt. The commercial won local, national and international success.

The ad was tested live in front of movie goers in theatres in Ottawa and deemed successful enough to run on-air.
It was the work of the public relations agency Thornley Fallis together with Molson that helped garner local, national and International awards. Director, Kelly Swinney(Donovan), and team successfully won the Canadian Public Relations award, the national Gold Quill award &amp; the prestigious International Public Relations award in 2001.

In addition to the commercial “Joe Canada” as he was called did a cross rogue tour on Canada Day crossing the Nation in 26 hours and visiting Provinces to recite the rant. Beginning in Newfoundland and ending in Vancouver.

In 2002, John Robert Colombo included the Rant in the &quot;Penguin Treasury of Popular Canadian Poems and Songs&quot;. Colombo acknowledged that it was unusual to include the text of a beer commercial in a poetry collection, but emphasized that &quot;the open-minded reader will respond to the power of the words that express a human need to affirm an identity in the face of ignorance and indifference,&quot; and compared it to the works of Christopher Smart, Ebenezer Elliot, and Vachel Lindsay.

=== Parodies ===
The popularity of &quot;I Am Canadian&quot; in Canada led to many parodies of the advertisement. Several radio stations have produced provincial variations on the theme. These include &quot;I am an Albertan&quot;, &quot;I am a British Columbian&quot;, &quot;I am a Newfoundlander&quot;, and &quot;I Am Not Canadian&quot;, the last of which focused on the Quebec sovereignty movement.

William Shatner performed his own variation on the idea in a Just for Laughs appearance. He announced to the world: &quot;I am not a Starfleet commander, ...or T.J. Hooker.&quot; The rant continues, making fun of Trekkies and his own typecasting as James T. Kirk, as well as Molson itself (&quot;I drink Labatt&#x27;s, not Romulan ale!&quot;).

Weasel, the lead character of &quot;I Am Weasel&quot;, parodied the advertisement in a promotional ad for the series&#x27; home, Cartoon Network. The ad later aired on a similar Canadian outlet, Teletoon.

During the 2002 Swiss National Exposition, the Swiss National Bank pavilion featured an &quot;Ich bin Schweizer&quot; adaptation of the ad, using stereotypes held by Germans about the Swiss.

At the Juno Awards of 2022, actor and host Simu Liu opened the ceremony with an updated riff on the &quot;I Am Canadian&quot; ad, highlighting contemporary signifiers such as multicultural food, runaway housing prices and the legalization of marijuana.

=== Trivia ===
This commercial premiered during the Academy Awards, which, in that year, included Robin Williams singing the song &quot;Blame Canada&quot;, a satirical song from the movie &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut.&quot;

== &quot;The Anthem&quot; ==
This ad features famous moments from Canadian history (including the pounding of the Last Spike and the raising of the Maple Leaf flag), as well as a variety of average Canadians (including William Shatner), singing a song extolling the virtues of Canada and its citizens.

<doc id="377264" wikidata="Q315500" url="?curid=377264" title="Pushpa Kamal Dahal">
<text>Pushpa Kamal Dahal (; born Ghanashyam Dahal, 11 December 1954), alias Prachanda (, , &quot;fierce&quot;), is a Nepalese politician, currently serving as the Leader of the Opposition, since July 2024. He has served as the Prime Minister of Nepal on three separate occasions, from 2008 to 2009 as the first prime minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, from 2016 to 2017, and again from 2022 to 2024.

Having been drawn to left-wing politics after seeing severe poverty during his youth, Dahal joined the Communist Party of Nepal (Fourth Convention) in 1981, and later became general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Mashal) in 1989. This party later became the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). Dahal was the leader of the CPN (M) during the country&#x27;s civil war and subsequent peace process and the 1st Nepalese constituent assembly. In the 2008 elections, CPN(M) emerged as the largest party, and Dahal became prime minister in August of that year. He resigned from the post on 4 May 2009, after his attempt to sack the then army chief, Rookmangud Katawal, was opposed by then President Ram Baran Yadav. Dahal was sworn in as prime minister for a second time in 2016, as per an agreement to form a rotational government with the Nepali Congress, and resigned on 24 May 2017 to make way for Congress&#x27; Sher Bahadur Deuba. Following the 2022 general election, Dahal was sworn in as prime minister again in December 2022, with support from a coalition of parties including CPN (UML), Rastriya Swatantra Party and Rastriya Prajatantra Party. Dahal remained in power for 19 months, changing alliances between the UML and Congress three times, before he was ousted by a failed motion of confidence in the parliament on 12 July 2024.

==Early life==
He was born Ghanashyam Dahal on 11 December 1954 in Lewade, Dhikur Pokhari, a VDC 20km north from Pokhara, to Muktiram and Bhawani, a Brahmin Hindu family. He later changed his name during a matriculation examination to Pushpa Kamal (meaning: &quot;Lotus Flower&quot;). At the age of eight, his family migrated to the Terai, a fertile lowland region in southern Nepal, and settled in Chitwan District. In the 1950s, his father Muktiram moved to Indian state of Assam, where he worked as a firewood collector, and returned home in 1961. In 1971, Pushpa Kamal Dahal moved to Kathmandu for his studies, and was enrolled in Patan Multiple Campus for two years. He moved back to Chitwan and received a diploma of science in agriculture from Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science (IAAS) in Rampur, Chitwan. After completing studies and failing to find jobs in bureaucracy, Dahal became a schoolteacher in a village, where he worked until 1979. He was also a home teacher at the same village.

==Nepalese Civil War==

On 4 February 1996, Baburam Bhattarai gave the government, led by Nepali Congress Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, a list of 40 demands, threatening civil war if they were not met. The demands related to &quot;nationalism, democracy, and livelihood&quot; and included such line items as the &quot;domination of foreign capital in Nepali industries, business and finance should be stopped&quot;, and &quot;discriminatory treaties, including the 1950 Nepal-India Treaty, should be abrogated&quot;, and &quot;land under the control of the feudal system should be confiscated and distributed to the landless and the homeless.&quot; After that, and until 26 April 2006, Dahal directed the military efforts of the CPN (Maoist Centre) towards establishing areas of control, particularly in the mountainous regions and in western Nepal. The 40 demands were whittled down to 24 in subsequent political negotiations.

In late 2004 or early 2005, relations between Dahal and Baburam Bhattarai soured. This was reportedly due to disagreement on power-sharing inside the party. Bhattarai was unhappy with the consolidation of power under Dahal. At one point, Dahal expelled Bhattarai from the party, though he was later reinstated. They later reconciled at least some of their differences. On 22 November 2005, Dahal and the Seven Party Alliance released a &#x27;twelve-point agreement&#x27; that expressed areas of agreement between the CPN(M) and the parties that had won a large majority in the last parliamentary election in 1999. Among other points, this document stated that the dictatorial monarchy of King Gyanendra was the chief impediment to progress in Nepal. It claimed further that the Maoists were committed to human rights and press freedoms and a multi-party system of government. It pledged self-criticism and the intention of the Maoists and the Seven Parties to not repeat past mistakes.

On 26 April 2006, CPN (Maoist Centre) announced a ceasefire with a stated duration of 90 days. The move followed weeks of massive protests—the April 2006 Nepalese general strike— in Kathmandu and elsewhere that had forced King Gyanendra to give up the personal dictatorship he had established on 1 February 2005, and restore the parliament that had been dissolved in May 2002. A new government was then established by the Seven-Party Alliance. The parliament and the new government supported the ceasefire and started negotiations with the Maoists on the basis of the twelve-point agreement. The two sides agreed that a new constituent assembly would be elected to write a new constitution and decide the fate of the monarchy. The Maoists wanted this process to end with Nepal becoming declared as a republic.

==Premierships==
=== First premiership ===
Dahal met for talks with Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala on 16 June 2006, which was thought to be his first visit to the capital Kathmandu in more than a decade. This meeting resulted in the Comprehensive Peace Accord to dissolve parliament, incorporate the CPN(M) into a new interim government, draft a new constitution, and disband the CPN(M)&#x27;s &quot;people&#x27;s governments&quot; operating in rural Nepal. The two sides also agreed to disarm at a later date, under international supervision. On 18 September 2007, the CPN(M) left the coalition government ahead of the Constituent Assembly election, demanding the declaration of a republic by parliament, and a system of proportional representation in the election. The CPN(M) rejoined the government on 30 December 2007, after an agreement to abolish the monarchy following the election, and to have a system of partial proportional representation in the election. Following power-sharing discussions that lasted several months, Dahal was elected as prime minister by the Constituent Assembly on 15 August 2008, and he was sworn in as prime minister on 18 August 2008.

The decade-long war ultimately led the Maoists to Nepal&#x27;s parliament. After winning a remarkable majority in the Constitutional Assembly elections, Dahal was nominated for the Prime Ministership by the party. In the April 2008 Constituent Assembly election, he was elected from Kathmandu constituency-10, winning by a large margin, and receiving nearly twice as many votes as his nearest rival, the candidate of the Nepali Congress. He also won overwhelmingly in Rolpa constituency-2, receiving 34,230 votes against 6,029 for Shanta Kumar Oli of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), CPN(UML). With the CPN(M) appearing to have won the election, Dahal pledged that the party would work together with other parties in crafting the new constitution, and he assured the international community, particularly India and China, that the party wanted good relations and co-operation. He also said that the party had expressed its commitment to multi-party democracy through the election.

=== Second premiership ===
In August 2016 Pushpa Kamal Dahal was elected for a second stint as Prime Minister of Nepal. Dahal became the 24th prime minister since Nepal&#x27;s adoption of multi-party democracy in 1990 and the eighth since the abolition of the monarchy in 2008. He resigned from the post of prime minister on 24 May 2017 and was succeeded by Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress in June.

=== Third premiership ===
Pushpa Kamal Dahal was appointed prime minister for the third time on 25 December 2022, following the 2022 Nepalese general election. He won the vote of confidence in the House on 10 January 2023 after 268 out of the present 270 members voted in favor of him.

Following Dahal&#x27;s support for the candidature of Ram Chandra Poudel in the presidential election, the CPN (UML) withdrew its support from the government, and Dahal again joined hands with the Congress to revive the pre-election alliance. 

Dahal condemned the actions of Hamas during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, but also expressed support for Palestine and spoke in favor of a ceasefire, saying &quot;we support the oppressed, those who deserve independence. We support Palestine&quot;.

On 4 March 2024, Dahal ended his coalition with the Nepali Congress and formed a new coalition with the CPN (UML) and other smaller parties. On 3 July however, the CPN (UML) left its coalition with Dahal and formed a coalition instead with the Nepali Congress. On 12 July, Dahal lost a vote of confidence in the House after 194 out of the present 258 members voted against his favour leading to the end of his third tenure as prime minister.

== Personal life ==
In 1969, Dahal married Sita Poudel (5 July 1954 – 12 July 2023) when he was fifteen. They had three daughters (including Renu Dahal) and a son.

In keeping with Marxist ideology, Dahal is an atheist, having stopped practicing Hinduism in his teenage years.

<doc id="377267" wikidata="Q314691" url="?curid=377267" title="Mohamed Boudiaf">
<text>Mohamed Boudiaf (23 June 1919 – 29 June 1992, ; ALA-LC: &quot;Muḥammad Bū-Ḍiyāf&quot;), also called Si Tayeb el Watani, was an Algerian political leader and one of the founders of the revolutionary National Liberation Front (FLN) that led the Algerian War of Independence (1954–1962). Boudiaf was exiled soon after Algerian independence, and did not go back to Algeria for 27 years. He returned in 1992 to accept a position of Chairman of the High Council of State, but was assassinated four months later.

== Early years ==

Mohamed Boudiaf was born in Ouled Madhi (now in M&#x27;Sila Province), French Algeria, to a family of erstwhile nobility which had lost its standing and influence during colonial times. His education was cut short after primary school by poor health (tuberculosis) and his increasing activism in the nascent nationalist movement. A member of the nationalist Parti du Peuple Algérien (PPA) of Messali Hadj, he later joined the successor organization MTLD and its secret paramilitary wing, the &quot;Organisation Spéciale&quot; (OS). Boudiaf was responsible for organizing the OS network in the Sétif region, storing arms, collecting funds and preparing guerrilla forces. He was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to 10 years of prison by the French authorities, but avoided arrest.

When Messali decided to dissolve the OS, his rivals combined with stalwarts of the guerrilla strategy to form the CRUA, a breakout committee designed to lay the groundwork for revolutionary war. Boudiaf was among them, after falling out with Messali, whom he accused of authoritarian tendencies. The CRUA - PPA/MTLD rivalry quickly spiralled towards violence, and would continue during the Algerian War until the PPA/MTLD (then reorganized as the Mouvement National Algérien, MNA) was largely destroyed. In July 1954, the CRUA-aligned Boudiaf survived an assassination attempt by his former comrades-in-arms, wounded and left for dead on an Algiers sidewalk.

== Algerian war of independence ==
The CRUA re-emerged as the Front de Libération Nationale, or FLN, which began a nationwide armed insurrection against France on November 1, 1954. Boudiaf was by this time a main leader of the movement, and emerged as an important member of the exiled leadership working from Cairo and Algeria&#x27;s neighbouring countries. In 1956, he was captured along with Ahmed Ben Bella and several other FLN leaders in a controversial aircraft hijacking by French forces, and imprisoned in France. While prisoner, he was symbolically elected minister in the FLN&#x27;s government-in-exile, the GPRA, at its creation in 1958, and re-elected in 1960 and 1961. Additionally, he was named one of the Vice Presidents. He was not released until immediately before the independence of Algeria in 1962, after a brutal eight-year war that had cost between 350,000 and 1.5 million lives.

== After independence: opposition and exile ==

On independence, internal conflict racked the FLN, which split into rival factions as French forces withdrew. A military-political alliance between col. Houari Boumédiène of the Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN) and Ahmed Ben Bella, of the exiled leadership, brought down their rivals and set up a single-party state under Ben Bella&#x27;s presidency.

The increasingly marginalized Boudiaf protested these developments, and founded a clandestine opposition party, the PRS, which briefly revolted against the FLN&#x27;s single-party government. Boudiaf was forced into exile, and settled in neighbouring Morocco. After Colonel Boumédiène&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état in 1965, Boudiaf remained in opposition, as he did under his successor, Colonel Chadli Bendjedid (in power 1979-92). His PRS group remained intermittently active in its opposition towards the government, but for all intents and purposes, Boudiaf had ceased to be a force of any stature in Algerian politics early on after his exile.

== Return as head of state ==

In February 1992, after a 27-year exile in Kenitra, 15 miles north of Morocco&#x27;s capital Rabat, the military invited him back to become chairman of the High Council of State (HCE) of Algeria, a figurehead body for the military junta, following the annulment of the election results (see Algerian Civil War). He quickly accepted, and was instantly signed into the post. Publicly, he was presented as a leader exiled for too long to be tainted by the violence and corruption of Algeria&#x27;s internal post-revolutionary politics, but the downside was that he was little known to most of the Algerian public. However, his calls for comprehensive reform and an end to military domination of politics instilled hope, and he quickly gained some popularity, even if many still associated him with the military clique that effectively ruled Algeria in his name.

Even as head of state, Boudiaf was completely dependent on the forces that had brought him to power, and his powers were circumscribed by the military and security establishment. In addition, the country continued to drift towards civil war, with increasing Islamist violence in the regions surrounding Algiers and brutal military countermeasures both escalating the situation. The political scene remained chaotic, the economy was fraying, and Boudiaf seemed unable to effectively carry out the reforms he had promised.

== Assassination and legacy ==
On June 29, 1992, Boudiaf&#x27;s term as HCE chairman was cut short when he was assassinated by a bodyguard during a televised public speech at the opening of a cultural center in Annaba, on his first visit outside Algiers as head of state. The murder caused intense shock in Algeria, and remains a moment of iconic importance in the country&#x27;s modern history. Boudiaf himself has gained considerably in political stature after his death, and is now referred to by many political commentators as a martyr for Algeria, with many arguing that he could have been the country&#x27;s savior.

The assassin, Lieutenant Lambarek Boumaarafi, was said to have acted as a lone gunman due to his Islamist sympathies. He was sentenced to death in a closed trial in 1995, but the sentence was not carried out. The murder has been subject to significant controversy and a major magnet for Algerian conspiracy theories, with many suggesting that Boudiaf was in fact assassinated by the military establishment responsible for the coup (and for his installment as HCE chairman). These theories have centered on the fact that Boudiaf had recently initiated a drive against the corruption of the Algerian regime, and stripped several important military officials of their posts.

Boudiaf was survived by his wife, Fatiha. She remains insistent that his death has not been properly investigated.

<doc id="377287" wikidata="Q577407" url="?curid=377287" title="The Party (1968 film)">
<text>The Party is a 1968 American comedy film, produced, co-written and directed by Blake Edwards. Based on a premise, the film stars Peter Sellers as a bungling actor from India, who accidentally gets invited to a lavish Hollywood dinner party. The film is a farce with a very loose structure; it essentially serves as a series of set pieces for Sellers&#x27;s improvisational comedy talents.

The protagonist Hrundi Bakshi was influenced by two of Sellers&#x27; earlier characters: the Indian doctor Ahmed el Kabir in &quot;The Millionairess&quot; (1960) and Inspector Clouseau in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; series. Bakshi went on to inspire popular characters such as Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s role in &quot;Namak Halaal&quot; (1982) and Apu in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. However, &quot;The Party&quot; has been criticized as having perpetuated brown stereotypes and using &quot;brownface&quot; with an exaggerated accent.

==Plot==
The production of a costume epic film is ruined when Indian actor Hrundi V. Bakshi accidentally blows up an enormous fort set. The director fires Hrundi immediately and complains to the studio head, General Fred R. Clutterbuck. Clutterbuck writes down Hrundi&#x27;s name to blacklist him, but he inadvertently writes it on the guest list of his upcoming dinner party. Hrundi receives his invitation and drives to the party. Upon arriving, he steps in mud and tries to rinse his shoe in a shallow pool in the house. He loses his shoe, with which he is reunited after much difficulty, when it is served to him on a silver platter by a waiter.

Hrundi has several awkward interactions at the party. He meets famous Western movie actor &quot;Wyoming Bill&quot; Kelso, who gives Hrundi an autograph. Hrundi later accidentally shoots Kelso with a toy gun, and escapes before Kelso can see who did it. Hrundi feeds a caged macaw and drops the birdfeed on the floor. He fiddles with a panel of electronics that controls the intercom, a &quot;Manneken Pis&quot; sculpture (soaking a guest), and a retractable bar (where Clutterbuck is seated). After Kelso&#x27;s handshake crushes Hrundi&#x27;s hand, Hrundi sticks it into a bowl of crushed ice containing caviar. While waiting to wash his hand, he meets aspiring actress Michèle Monet, who came with producer C.S. Divot. Hrundi shakes hands with Divot, who does the same with other guests, passing around the fishy odor, and back to Hrundi after he has washed his hand.

At dinner, Hrundi is seated by the kitchen door in a very low chair. During the main course, Hrundi&#x27;s roast chicken catapults off his fork and becomes impaled upon a guest&#x27;s tiara. Hrundi asks an increasingly drunk waiter, Levinson, to retrieve his meal, but the woman&#x27;s wig comes off as well, even as she remains oblivious. The drunk Levinson ends up brawling with his fellow wait staff, and dinner is disrupted.

Hrundi apologizes to his hosts. Desperate for a bathroom, he wanders through the house, opening doors and catching servants and guests in embarrassing situations. He ends up in the backyard, where he accidentally sets off the sprinklers. At Divot&#x27;s insistence, Michèle gives an impromptu guitar performance of &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; to impress the guests. Hrundi goes upstairs, where he saves Michèle from Divot&#x27;s unwanted advances by dislodging Divot&#x27;s toupee. Hrundi finally finds a bathroom, but he breaks the toilet, drops a painting in it, gets toilet paper everywhere, and floods the bathroom. To avoid being discovered Hrundi sneaks onto the roof and falls into the pool. After Michèle leaps in to save him, Hrundi is coerced to drink alcohol to warm up.

A Russian dance troupe arrives at the party. Upstairs, Hrundi finds Michèle crying and consoles her. Divot bursts in and demands Michèle leave with him. Michèle declines, and Divot cancels her upcoming screen test. Hrundi persuades her to stay and have a good time with him. They return to the party in borrowed clothes. The party gets wilder, and Hrundi offers to retract the bar to make room for dancing. Instead, he opens a retractable floor with a pool underneath, causing guests to fall in. Clutterbuck&#x27;s daughter arrives with friends and a baby elephant painted with hippie slogans over its body. Hrundi takes offense and asks them to wash the elephant. The entire house is soon filled with soap bubbles.

Back at his home, Divot realizes who Hrundi is, and races back to the party. As the band plays on, Clutterbuck tries to save his suds-covered paintings. The air conditioning blows suds everywhere as the guests dance, and Clutterbuck&#x27;s distraught wife repeatedly falls into the pool. Divot pulls up as the police and fire department personnel work to resolve everything. Hrundi apologizes one last time to Clutterbuck as Divot reveals who Hrundi is, but Clutterbuck accidentally chokes the headwaiter instead of Hrundi. Kelso gives Hrundi an autographed photo and Stetson hat as Hrundi and Michèle leave in Hrundi&#x27;s Morgan three-wheeler car. Outside her apartment, Hrundi gives Michèle the hat as a keepsake, and she says he can come get it any time. Hrundi suggests next week, and she readily agrees. Hrundi smiles and drives off as his car backfires.

==Cast==
Vin Scully is uncredited and does not appear onscreen, but his voice can be heard announcing a Los Angeles Dodgers game on the kitchen radio.

==Production==
&quot;The Party&quot; was the only non-Pink Panther collaboration between Sellers and Edwards. Producer Walter Mirisch knew that Sellers and Edwards were considered liabilities; in his autobiography, Mirisch wrote &quot;Blake had achieved a reputation as a very expensive director, particularly after &quot;The Great Race&quot;.&quot; Sellers had played an Indian man (Dr. Ahmed el Kabir) in his hit film &quot;The Millionairess&quot; (1960), and another Indian physician in &quot; The Road to Hong Kong&quot; (1962). He is mostly remembered as a similar klutz as Inspector Clouseau in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; series.

The film&#x27;s interiors were shot on a set, at the MGM lot, though this may be a mistake as IMDb lists the Samuel Goldwyn Studios on Formosa as the correct address, likely as other Mirisch Productions, including &quot;West Side Story&quot;, were shot there as well. The original script was only 63 pages in length. Edwards later said it was the shortest script he ever shot from, and that the majority of the content in the film was improvised on set.

The film started shooting in May 1967 under the title &quot;RSVP&quot;, and lasted for 12 weeks over the summer of 1967. Edwards and Sellers had initially attempted to film part of it as a modern silent picture with subtitles, but Sellers soon found a need to speak and develop the character of Hrundi V. Bakshi, a name he came up with on the spot. Several cast and crew members described the production as the most enjoyable of their career, with Denny Miller describing it as &quot;heaven&quot;, stating that they knew it was something special when cast and crew not even involved with the shooting of certain scenes would stick around just to watch the filming. Claudine Longet very visibly found it difficult to keep a straight face in many scenes. Steve Franken, who played the drunken butler, thoroughly enjoyed being allowed to improvise, but noted the dangers of the foam in the water and struggled to breathe. The pool scene where his love interest pours a bottle on his face was improvised due to him murmuring to her to clear the foam from his face as he couldn&#x27;t breathe.

The film draws much inspiration from the works of Jacques Tati; Bakshi arrives at the party in a Morgan three-wheeler which may suggest Monsieur Hulot&#x27;s car in &quot;Monsieur Hulot&#x27;s Holiday&quot;. However, it was not the same car (Salmson AL3). The entire film storyline is reminiscent of the Royal Garden restaurant sequence of &quot;Playtime&quot;, and the comedic interaction with inanimate objects and gadgets parallels several of Tati&#x27;s films, especially &quot;Mon Oncle&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The score of &quot;The Party&quot; was composed by Henry Mancini, including the song &quot;Nothing to Lose,&quot; performed onscreen by Claudine Longet. Mancini, commenting on audience reactions, noted, &quot;That&#x27;s what I get for writing a nice song for a comedy. Nobody&#x27;s going to hear a note of it.&quot; During a scene later in the film, the band can be heard playing &quot;It Had Better Be Tonight (Meglio stasera),&quot; a song Mancini composed for the first &quot;Pink Panther&quot; film. The CD originally was released on August 20, 1995, by BMG Victor.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 23 reviews, with an average score of 6.60/10.

&quot;The Party&quot; is considered a classic comedic cult film. Edwards&#x27; biographers Peter Lehman and William Luhr said, &quot;&quot;The Party&quot; may very well be one of the most radically experimental films in Hollywood history; in fact it may be the single most radical film since D.W. Griffith&#x27;s style came to dominate the American cinema.&quot; Saul Austerlitz wrote &quot;Despite the offensiveness of Sellers&#x27;s brownface routine, &quot;The Party&quot; is one of his very best films...Taking a page from Tati, this is neorealist comedy, purposefully lacking a director&#x27;s guiding eye: look here, look there. The screen is crammed full of activity, and the audience&#x27;s eyes are left to wander where they may.&quot;

===Racial criticism===
&quot;The Party&quot; has been criticized as having perpetuated brown stereotypes and using &quot;brownface&quot; with an exaggerated accent. Shane Danielson described it in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;A comic masterpiece - yet hardly the most enlightened depiction of our subcontinental brothers. Still, propelled by Sellers&#x27;s insane brio, this late display of blackface provided some guilty chuckles, and at least one enduring catchphrase (the immortal &#x27;Birdie num-num&#x27;).&quot; (Edwards has run into similar later criticism for his inclusion of Mickey Rooney&#x27;s overbroad Japanese caricature in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;).

However, the film was also hugely popular in India. The Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was a fan and was very fond of repeating Bakshi&#x27;s line &quot;In India we don&#x27;t &quot;think&quot; who we are, we &quot;know&quot; who we are!&quot;, the character&#x27;s reply to a hostile &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot; The character Hrundi Bakshi also inspired Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s character Arjun Singh in the 1982 Hindi-language film &quot;Namak Halaal&quot;. Additionally, for his film &quot;The Alien&quot;, Indian director Satyajit Ray was planning on casting Sellers as a Marwari businessman. Ray was a fan of Sellers, and believed he could convincingly portray Indian characters based on his performances in &quot;The Party&quot; and &quot;The Millionairess&quot;. Sellers eventually pulled out of the project and the film fell apart.

<text>A wireless Internet service provider (WISP) is an Internet service provider with a network based on wireless networking. Technology may include commonplace Wi-Fi wireless mesh networking, or proprietary equipment designed to operate over open 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 4.9, 5, 24, and 60 GHz bands or licensed frequencies in the UHF band (including the MMDS frequency band), LMDS, and other bands from 6 GHz to 80 GHz.

In the US, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a Report and Order, FCC 05-56 in 2005 that revised the FCC’s rules to open the 3650 MHz band for terrestrial wireless broadband operations. On November 14, 2007 the Commission released a Public Notice (DA 07-4605) in which the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau announced the start date for the licensing and registration process for the 3650-3700 MHz band.

As of July 2015, over 2,000 fixed wireless broadband providers operate in the US, servicing nearly 4 million customers.

==History==
Initially, WISPs were only found in rural areas not covered by cable television or DSL. There were 879 Wi-Fi based WISPs in the Czech Republic as of May 2008, making it the country with most Wi-Fi access points in the whole EU.; which was a consequence of the then de facto monopoly of the former telecom operator on fixed data networks. The providing of wireless Internet has a big potential of lower the &quot;digital gap&quot; or &quot;Internet gap&quot; in the developing countries. Geekcorps actively help in Africa with among others wireless network building. An example of a typical WISP system is such as the one deployed by Gaiacom Wireless Networks which is based on Wi-Fi standards. The One Laptop per Child project strongly relies on good Internet connectivity, which can most likely be provided in rural areas only with satellite or wireless network Internet access. In high internet cost countries such as South Africa, prices have been drastically reduced by the government allocating spectrum to smaller WISPs, who are able to deliver high speed broadband at a much lower cost.

Some WISP networks have been started in rural parts of the United Kingdom, to address issues with poor broadband DSL service (bandwidth) in rural areas (&quot;notspots&quot;), including slow rollout of fibre based services which could improve service (usually Fibre to the cabinet to groups of rural buildings, potentially Fibre to the premises for isolated buildings). A number of these WISPs have been set up via the Community Broadband Network, using funds from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development

==Overview==
WISPs often offer additional services like location-based content, Virtual Private Networking (VPN) and Voice over IP. Isolated municipal ISPs and larger statewide initiatives alike are tightly focused on wireless networking.

WISPs have a large market share in rural environments where cable and digital subscriber lines are not available; further, with technology available, they can meet or beat speeds of legacy cable and telephone systems. In urban environments, gigabit wireless links are common and provide levels of bandwidth previously only available through expensive fiber optic connections.

Typically, the way that a WISP operates is to order a fiber circuit to the center of the area they wish to serve. From there, the WISP builds backhauls (gigabit wireless or fiber) to elevated points in the region, such as radio towers, tall buildings, grain silos, or water towers. Those locations have access points to provide service to individual customers, or backhauls to other towers where they have more equipment. The WISP may also use gigabit wireless links to connect a PoP (Point of Presence) to several towers, reducing the need to pay for fiber circuits to the tower. For fixed wireless connections, a small dish or other antenna is mounted to the roof of the customer&#x27;s building and aligned to the WISP&#x27;s nearest antenna site. Where a WISP operates over the tightly limited range of the heavily populated 2.4 GHz band, as nearly all 802.11-based Wi‑Fi providers do, it is not uncommon to also see access points mounted on light posts and customer buildings.

Roaming between service providers is possible with the draft protocol WISPr, a set of recommendations which facilitate inter-network and inter-operator roaming of Wi-Fi users.

<doc id="377294" wikidata="Q560939" url="?curid=377294" title="Pons, Count of Tripoli">
<text>Pons ( 1098 – 25 March 1137) was count of Tripoli from 1112 to 1137. He was a minor when his father, Bertrand, died in 1112. He swore fealty to the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos in the presence of a Byzantine embassy. His advisors sent him to Antioch to be educated in the court of Tancred of Antioch, ending the hostilities between the two crusader states. Tancred granted four important fortresses to Pons in the Principality of Antioch. Since Pons held his inherited lands in fief of the kings of Jerusalem, Tancred&#x27;s grant strengthened the autonomy of the County of Tripoli. On his deathbed, Tancred also arranged the marriage of his wife, Cecile of France, to Pons.

Pons closely cooperated with Tancred&#x27;s successor, Roger of Salerno, against the Muslim rulers in the 1110s. He refused obedience to Baldwin II of Jerusalem in early 1122, but their vassals soon mediated a reconciliation between the two rulers. Pons was one of the supreme commanders of the crusader troops during the successful siege of Tyre in 1124. He supported Alice of Jerusalem, the dowager princess of Antioch, against their brother-in-law King Fulk of Jerusalem in late 1132, but they could not prevent him from taking control of Antioch. A year later, Pons was only able to defend his county against Imad ad-Din Zengi, atabeg of Mosul, with Fulk&#x27;s assistance.

Bazwāj, the mamluk (slave) commander of Damascus, invaded Tripoli in a battle in March 1137. Bazwāj defeated Pons, forcing him to flee to the mountains where native Christians captured Pons. His captors handed him over to Bazwāj who had him killed. The County of Tripoli developed into a fully independent crusader state during Pons&#x27; reign.

==Early life==

Pons&#x27; father, Bertrand, was the eldest son of Count Raymond IV of Toulouse. Bertrand&#x27;s legitimacy was dubious, however, because his parents were closely related. The identity of Pons&#x27; mother is uncertain. The contemporaneous English chronicler Orderic Vitalis stated that Helie of Burgundy (a daughter of Duke Odo I of Burgundy) was his mother. William of Malmesbury, however, wrote that Pons had been born to an unnamed niece of the powerful Margravine Matilda of Tuscany. The year of Pons&#x27; birth is also uncertain. The contemporaneous Muslim author, Ibn al-Qalanisi, noted that Pons was a &quot;small boy&quot; when his father died in early 1112. William of Malmesbury and William of Tyre wrote that Pons had been an &quot;adolescent&quot; when he succeeded his father. According to historian Kevin James Lewis, available information suggests Pons was born around 1098.

Pons&#x27; grandfather, Raymond IV, was the first prominent nobleman to join the First Crusade in 1095. His attempts to secure the supreme command of the military campaign failed, neither could he keep the fortresses that he conquered from the local Muslim rulers in northern Syria in 1098. Northern Syria developed into a crusader state, the Principality of Antioch, under the rule of Raymond&#x27;s rivals, the Norman Bohemond and Tancred. Unlike Bohemond and Tancred, Raymond accepted the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos&#x27;s suzerainty and acted as the Emperor&#x27;s lieutenant, but the Byzantines could not put an end to the Normans&#x27; rule in northern Syria. After the crusaders captured Jerusalem, Raymond refused to rule the Holy City, thus a new crusader state, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, developed in Palestine under the rule of two brothers from Lower Lorraine, Godfrey and Baldwin I.

Raymond IV laid siege to Tripoli—an important economic and cultural center on the northern border of the Fatimid Caliphate—with Byzantine support in May 1103. Although he adopted the title of count of Tripoli and took control of the nearby villages, he died on 28 February 1105 without conquering the town. Raymond&#x27;s troops continued the siege, but his infant son, Alfonso Jordan, was taken back to the County of Toulouse. Pons&#x27; father, Bertrand, renounced Toulouse in favor of Alfonso Jordan for unknown reasons in the summer of 1108. He soon sailed to Syria to claim the lands his father had conquered around Tripoli. He swore allegiance to Baldwin I of Jerusalem to secure his support and the united armies of the crusader states captured Tripoli on 12 July 1109. Pons most probably had accompanied his father from Toulouse to Syria. He signed one of Bertrand&#x27;s charters issued in Tripoli in 1110 or 1111.

==Reign==

===Minority===

Pons was a minor when his father died on 3 February 1112. Anna Comnena recorded that Bishop Albert of Tripoli wanted to keep the money that a Byzantine embassy had deposited with Pons&#x27; father and himself. Lewis says, the dispute is evidence the bishop exerted a strong influence on the government during Pons&#x27; minority. The money was returned to the Byzantines only after they had threatened to impose a blockade on Tripoli. Pons could only keep the gold and other valuable objects explicitly promised to his father as personal gifts. The Byzantines also persuaded Pons to swear fealty to Alexios I Komnenos as his grandfather and father had done.

His &quot;guardians and lords&quot; concluded an agreement with Tancred of Antioch, making Pons &quot;one of Tancred&#x27;s knights&quot;, according to Ibn al-Qalanisi. Historian Jean Richard associated the &quot;guardians and lords&quot; with the most influential noblemen of the County of Tripoli who ruled the county on the minor count&#x27;s behalf. Their decision helped to reconcile Antioch&#x27;s Norman and Tripoli&#x27;s Occitan crusaders, who had fallen out during the Siege of Antioch. The conflict with the Byzantines also contributed to the rapprochement between Tripoli and Antioch.

Tancred granted Tortosa (now Tartus in Syria), Maraclea, Safita and Krak des Chevalierswhich had been claimed by the counts of Tripolito Pons in fief. Pons held his inherited lands in fief of the kings of Jerusalem. Tancred&#x27;s grant contributed to the development of Tripoli into an autonomous crusader state. He died in December 1112, but only after ordering his wife, Cecile of France, be engaged to Pons. William of Malmesbury wrote that the dying prince arranged the marriage because he was convinced that Pons would be a successful military leader.

Pons remained in Antioch during the first months or years of the rule of Tancred&#x27;s successor, Roger of Salerno. Baldwin I of Jerusalem sent envoys to Antioch to seek the assistance of Roger and Pons against Mawdud, the Seljuk atabeg (governor) of Mosul, who had invaded the Kingdom of Jerusalem in late June 1113. However, Baldwin did not wait until their arrival and attacked the invaders near Tiberias. His army was defeated on 28 June. Pons accompanied Roger during the campaign and they sharply criticized Baldwin for his impatience after their arrival.

===Cooperation===

Walter, the chancellor of Antioch, who wrote a chronicle of the history of the principality, never refers to Pons&#x27; presence in Antioch. This implies he had reached the age of majority and returned to Tripoli before 29 November 1114 (which is the starting date of Walter&#x27;s narration). Pons was certainly in Tripoli when Bursuq ibn Bursuq of Hamadan invaded Antioch in 1115, because Roger of Salerno sent envoys from Antioch to Tripoli to seek his assistance. Walter recorded that Pons marched north to aid Roger only after Baldwin II of Jerusalem had ordered him to join his campaign. This shows that Pons still acknowledged the suzerainty of the king. After their united armies reached Apamea, Bursuq lifted the siege of the Antiochene fort of Kafartab and retreated without fighting. Baldwin and Pons soon returned to their countries, enabling Bursuq to return and capture Kafartab. Roger of Salerno attacked the invaders before Baldwin and Pons returned, and defeated Bursuq on 14 September.

Ilghazi, the Ortoquid ruler of Mardin, invaded Antioch at the end of May 1119. Bernard, the Latin patriarch of Antioch, convinced Roger to again seek help from Baldwin II and Pons. However, Roger could not wait until their arrival. He launched a counter-attack against Ilghazi leading his principality&#x27;s whole army. Roger died fighting and his army was annihilated on 28 June. Ilghazi tried to prevent Baldwin and Pons from reaching Antioch, but Baldwin entered the town without resistance. Pons, who arrived a day later, warded off Ilghazi&#x27;s attack in early August. Baldwin was acknowledged as the ruler of Antioch until its absent prince, Bohemond II, came of age.

===Conflicts and alliances===

Baldwin&#x27;s acquisition of Antioch made him the most powerful monarch of the crusader states which annoyed Pons. Neither Pons nor the bishops of his county attended the synod which was held on 23 January 1120 at Nablus, although all prelates and secular lords of the Kingdom of Jerusalem were present at the assembly. He openly refused obedience to the king in early 1122. Baldwin mustered his army and marched towards Tripoli, taking the True Cross from Jerusalem with him. According to Fulcher of Chartres&#x27; report, to avoid an armed conflict, the two rulers&#x27; vassals mediated a reconciliation, making Baldwin and Pons &quot;friends&quot;.

Balak, the Ortoquid ruler of Harran, captured Baldwin II of Jerusalem while Baldwin was hunting near the Euphrates on 18 April 1123. During his captivity, a Venetian fleet under the command of the Doge, Domenico Michele, arrived at Acre. Taking advantage of the presence of a sizeable army from Europe, the leaders of the Kingdom of Jerusalem decided to capture Tyre, one of the last of two Fatimid ports on the western coast of the Mediterranean Sea. They laid siege to the town on 16 February 1124.

The Jerusalemite nobles sent envoys to Pons, urging him to join the siege. Pons hurried to the town, accompanied by a large retinue, damaging the self-confidence of the town&#x27;s defenders, according to William of Tyre. Although Fulcher of Chartres and William of Tyre emphasized that Pons &quot;remained always obedient&quot; to Gormond, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, and other Jerusalemite lords during the siege, their narration is actually evidence that Pons was regarded as one of the supreme commanders of the Christian army. He led the Christian troops&#x27; successful attack against Toghtekin, the Emir of Damascus, who tried to relieve the besieged town. He was chosen to confer knighthood on the messenger of Joscelin I of Edessa who had brought the severed head of Balak (Baldwin&#x27;s captor) to the crusaders&#x27; camp. After the capture of Tyre on 7 July, Pons&#x27; banner was one of the three flags erected over the town&#x27;s towers. Balak&#x27;s relative, Timurtash, released Baldwin II in return for 80,000 dinars and Antiochene fortresses on 29 July, but the Antiochene lords prevented Baldwin from ceding the fortresses to him. 

Pons&#x27; activities in the late 1120s and early 1130s are poorly documented. He supported Baldwin II against Bursuq ibn Bursuq, who had invaded Antiochene territory and captured the fortress of Kafartab in May 1125. The united forces of Jerusalem, Antioch, Tripoli and Edessa defeated Bursuq at Zardana on 11 June, forcing him to lift the siege of the fort. Next year he sought help from the king in attacking Rafaniya (an important castle once held by Pons&#x27; grandfather, but lost to Toghtekin in 1115). They besieged the fortress for 18 days and captured it on 31 March 1126. Pons also participated in an unsuccessful campaign against Damascus in November 1129.

===Sedition===

Relationships between the crusader states became tense after Baldwin II died on 21 August 1131. His successor, Fulk of Anjou, seized the estates of the local lords in both Jerusalem and Antioch and granted them to his own partisans. His sister-in-law, Alice, the dowager princess of Antioch, wanted to take control of the government of Antioch. She formed an alliance with Pons and Joscelin II of Edessa in the summer of 1132. According to William of Tyre, Alice bribed Pons into the alliance. The Antiochene lords who opposed Alice asked King Fulk to intervene, but Pons refused the king passage through Tripoli. Fulk was forced to avoid the county and travel by sea to the Antiochene port of Saint Symeon (now Samandağ in Turkey).

Pons hurried to Antioch and launched a series of attacks against Fulk and his allies from the Antiochene fortresses Arcicanum and Rugia (two castles forming his wife&#x27;s dowry). Fulk attacked Pons near Rugia in late 1132. Pons suffered a heavy defeat. Although many of his retainers were captured on the battlefield, he was able to flee. His soldiers were taken in chains to Antioch where they were either imprisoned or executed. Pons lost Arcicanum and Rugia, but Fulk did not restore the suzerainty of the kings of Jerusalem over Tripoli.

===Last years===

Pons renounced the estates he held in the county of Velay (in France) in favor of the bishop of Le Puy in 1132. He had the &quot;ra&#x27;īs&quot; (native chief) of Tripoli killed for unknown reasons in 1132 or 1133. The killing of a native chief at a crusader ruler&#x27;s order was an unprecedented act. Lewis argues that it was a sign of growing unrest among the local population. Actually, the Nizari strengthened their hold on the mountainous region along the northern border of the county in the 1130s.

Imad ad-Din Zengi, atabeg (governor) of Mosul, invaded the County of Tripoli, plundering the capital and the neighboring region in 1133. Pons wanted to stop the invaders near Rafaniya, but his army was almost annihilated. After this catastrophic defeat, he fled first to Montferrand, and soon to Tripoli, while Zengi laid siege to the fort of Montferrand. Pons sought Fulk&#x27;s assistance and the arrival of the Jerusalemite army forced Zengi to lift the siege and to withdraw his troops from the county.

In March 1137, Bazwāj, the mamluk commander of Damascus, launched a military campaign against Tripoli, reaching Pilgrims&#x27; Mount near the town. Pons rode out of Tripoli to meet the enemy, but suffered a defeat. He fled to the nearby mountains, but local Christians—according to Lewis, most probably Jacobites or Nestorians—captured and handed him over to Bazwāj, who had him killed on 25 March 1137. His son, Raymond II, who inherited the County of Tripoli, and his retainers captured the local Christians from the nearby villages and had most of them tortured to death in revenge for Pons death.

==Family==

According to Albert of Aix, Pons married Tancred of Antioch&#x27;s widow, Cecile of France, in the presence of King Baldwin I of Jerusalem in Tripoli in the summer of 1115. Being a daughter of King Philip I of France and Bertrade de Montfort, she was the half-sister of King Fulk of Jerusalem. Pons&#x27; prestigious marriage strengthened his position and his descendants&#x27; royal ancestry was a well-known fact in the crusader states for decades. The eldest son of Pons and Cecile, Raymond, was most probably born in the late 1110s, because he was an &quot;adolescent&quot;—at least fifteen-year-old—when he succeeded Pons in 1137. Pons&#x27; younger son, Philip, was last mentioned in the 1140s, but the details of his life are unknown. Agnes, the only daughter of Pons and Cecile, was married to Rainald II Masoir, who was a prominent Antiochene nobleman.

Founded by Mark Goode and Greg Jackson in 1998, MobileStar was the first wireless ISP to place a WiFi hotspot in an airport, a hotel, or a coffee shop. MobileStar&#x27;s core value proposition was to provide wireless broadband connectivity for the business traveler in all the places s/he was likely to &quot;sleep, eat, move, or meet.&quot; MobileStar&#x27;s founder, Mark Goode, was the first to coin the now industry standard expression &quot;hotspot,&quot; as a reference to a location equipped with an 802.11 wireless access point.

MobileStar&#x27;s financing was initially provided by Greg Jackson. A predecessor entity, PLANCOM (Public Local Area Network Communications), was disbanded and the intellectual property moved into MobileStar Network. During the Series A financing round, funds were obtained from high-net-worth investors, corporate investors including Proxim and Comdisco, and institutional investors from New York. The Series B investors, who invested $38 million, included the Mayfield Fund and Blueprint Ventures.

MobileStar&#x27;s initial deployments used a frequency hopping product supplied by Proxim. As reported in the EE Times, &quot;In a move that represents the first use of unlicensed wireless LAN technology in the industrial scientific and medical (ISM) bands to develop a nationwide Internet-access network, Proxim Inc. has teamed up with Dallas-based MobileStar Network Inc. to link its 2.4-GHz unlicensed RangeLAN2 wireless LAN to a national network of Internet access points.&quot; However, after the IEEE 802.11b standard was adopted, MobileStar converted its network infrastructure to the 802.11b industry standard. The initial infrastructure was manufactured and financed by Cisco.
MobileStar&#x27;s founders faced many challenges in developing the company: evolving technology standards, fluid business models, no industry standard billing system, and questions about the competitive value of a site license agreement instead of licensed spectrum. Over time each of these issues were addressed and the agreement with Starbucks in late 2000 signaled a maturing of the marketplace. American Airlines also entered into an agreement with MobileStar as did Hilton Hotels As more laptop vendors included integrated 802.11 wireless connectivity within their laptops, users came to expect broadband connectivity in their residences, workplaces, and in public locations such as airports, coffee shops, and hotels. License-free broadband connectivity exploded with the advent of the iPhone in 2007, further validating the premise that license-free spectrum could open up a large domain of connectivity at a cost far less than licensed spectrum. The rise of voice over IP (VOIP) communications operating on the 2.4 MHz spectrum via the 802.11 standard was another indicator of the power of ubiquitous, low to no cost wireless broadband communications.

MobileStar Network&#x27;s demise in 2001 was the result of at least two important factors: the collapse in the private equity markets in mid-2001 and the events of September 11. While MobileStar&#x27;s investors provided a bridge loan during the mid-2001 time frame, the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington brought a steep decline in business travel, MobileStar Network&#x27;s initial core market. MobileStar&#x27;s investors could not continue to finance the business and new investors were skittish about investing in a company focused on serving a market that had recently and rapidly collapsed.

MobileStar Network ceased operation in October 2001, but its bankrupt assets and contracts were bought by Voicestream Wireless and by February 2002, was operating as T-Mobile Broadband. T-Mobile Broadband was the first part of VoiceStream to rebrand to the T-Mobile name. It was officially launched as T-Mobile HotSpot in August 2002. Many of the original MobileStar Network employees still work for T-Mobile Hotspot and have been responsible for its expansion.

<text>Interactive television is a form of media convergence, adding data services to traditional television technology. It has included on-demand delivery of content, online shopping, and viewer polls. Interactive TV is an example of how new information technology can be integrated vertically into established technologies and commercial structures.

==History==
Prior to the development of interactive television, interaction could only be simulated. In the 1950s, there were limited efforts to provide an illusion of interactive experience, most overtly with &quot;Winky Dink and You&quot;, which encouraged viewers to draw on a vinyl sheet they would attach to a television set. QUBE operated an interactive cable television service in Ohio from 1977 to 1984.

An interactive video-on-demand (VOD) television service was proposed in 1986 in Japan, where there were plans to develop an &quot;Integrated Network System&quot; service. It was intended to include various interactive services, including videotelephony, home shopping, online banking, remote work, and home entertainment services. However, it was not possible to practically implement such an interactive VOD service until the adoption of DCT and ADSL technologies made it possible in the 1990s. In early 1994, British Telecommunications (BT) began testing an interactive VOD television trial service in the United Kingdom. It used the DCT-based MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 video compression standards, along with ADSL technology.

Sega Channel, a service that allowed Sega Genesis owners to download video games on demand via cable television signals, began rolling out in the United States in 1994 and was discontinued in 1998. It has been described as a form of interactive television.

The first patent of interactive connected TV was granted in 1999 in the United States; it expired in 2015.

ATSC 3.0, also known as &quot;NextGen TV&quot;, adds interactivity features to terrestrial television. As of April 2022, broadcasters in 60 media markets in the United States were using ATSC 3.0.

==Forms of interaction==

Interactive TV includes programs that directly incorporate polls, questions, comments, and other forms of audience response back into the show. For example, Australian media producer Yahoo!7&#x27;s Fango mobile app allows viewers to provide material that producers can insert into live programming. During the 2012 Australian Open, viewers used the app to suggest questions for commentator Jim Courier to ask players in post-match interviews.

&quot;One-screen&quot; formats involve interaction on the TV screen, using the remote control. Remote-control user interfaces are known in human-computer interaction research as &quot;lean back&quot; interaction, and as a 10-foot user interface. Second screen interactive TV, also called Enhanced TV by ABC and ESPN, uses a personal computer or mobile application. Chat Television, developed in 1996, was the first example of a second screen interactive TV format. The system synchronized online services with television broadcasts, grouping users by time zone and program, so that all real-time viewers could participate in a chat or interactive gathering during the show&#x27;s airing.

Interactive TV features in smart TVs have drawn criticism because they allow TV manufacturers to collect and transmit data about customer behavior for the purposes of targeted advertising.

<text>The Beaverton School District (BSD 48J) is a school district in and around Beaverton, Oregon, United States. It serves students throughout Beaverton, Hillsboro, Aloha, and unincorporated neighborhoods of Portland, OR. The Beaverton Elementary School District 48 was established in 1876, with other elementary districts later merged into the district. The elementary district was later merged with the high school district (10J) to create a unified school district. It is the third-largest school district in the state, with an enrollment of 39,180 students as of 2022. For the 2022–2023 school year, the district had a total budget of $622.8 million.

The district employs over 2,100 teachers at its 34 elementary, nine middle, and six high schools as well as several option schools. Mountainside High School, the district&#x27;s sixth high school, opened in 2017. Tumwater Middle School (previously Timberland), the district&#x27;s ninth middle school, opened in the fall of 2021.

==History==
District 48 was established in 1876 as the &quot;Beaverton Elementary School District&quot;, serving grades 1–8. Over the years it merged with other elementary districts and finally, in July 1960, merged with the Beaverton High School District to create one unified school district. The district has followed the trends throughout the US, establishing schools for 7th–9th grades in the mid-1960s (to make a 6-3-3 system) and then in 1994 moving 6th grade into middle school and 9th grade back into high school to form the current 5-3-4 configuration.

The Beaverton School District&#x27;s school-age population grew by 44% in the 1990s, but by only 14% in the 2000s. The median age in the district increased from 33.3 in 2000 to 35.3 in 2010. The total population of the area under the district&#x27;s jurisdiction was 253,198 as of the 2010 census.

From March 2020 - March 2021, all students were instructed remotely either through online learning or through comprehensive distance learning. Return to in-person instruction began in April, 2021 with a hybrid model. About half of the district&#x27;s students chose in-person hybrid instruction with the rest choosing to continue comprehensive distance learning 

==Boundary==
Its service area in Washington County includes: Almost all of Beaverton, portions of Hillsboro and Tigard, all of the census-designated places of Cedar Hills, Garden Home–Whitford, Marlene Village, and Oak Hills, and portions of the census-designated places of Aloha, Bethany, Cedar Mill, Metzger, Raleigh Hills, Rockcreek, and West Slope.

The district extends into Multnomah County, where it includes a small portion of Portland.

==Schools==

===Elementary schools===



*Enrollment numbers are for 2019-2020 school year. Due to boundary changes or construction in the area, actual number may vary.

**Springville and Raleigh Hills were previously K-8 schools, with a choice for students in grades 6-8 to remain but were transitioned to K-5 in the 2023-2024 school year. Aloha-Huber Park remains a K-8 for dual language immersion students.

===Middle schools===
The Beaverton School District operates nine middle schools housing 6th, 7th, and 8th grades. Prior to the 1994–95 school year they housed students in grades 7–9, as a part of the district&#x27;s 6-3-3 plan established in the 1960s.

*Enrollment numbers are for 2019-2020 school year. Due to boundary changes or construction in the area, actual number may vary.

**Numbers in the LRFP are outdated as statistics at Stoller were taken before the opening of Tumwater. See sources for updated numbers.

=== High schools ===
High schools in Beaverton are part of the 6A-2 Metro League for interscholastic athletics and activities. The newest, Mountainside High School, opened in September 2017 for freshmen and sophomores. As a result, the district began planning to alter its high school boundaries. The boundary changes were approved in June 2017 and went into effect at the beginning of the 2017–2018 school year.

*Enrollment numbers are for 2019-2020 school year. Due to boundary changes or construction in the area, actual number may vary.

<doc id="377316" wikidata="Q1287698" url="?curid=377316" title="Tondo, Manila">
<text>Tondo is a district located in Manila, Philippines. It is the largest, in terms of area and population, of Manila&#x27;s sixteen districts, with a census-estimated 654,220 people in 2020. It consists of two congressional districts. It is also the second most densely populated district in the city.

== Etymology ==
The name Tondo can be derived from its Old Tagalog name, Tundun as inscribed in the Laguna Copperplate Inscription of 900 AD, the earliest native document found within the Philippines. Dutch anthropologist Antoon Postma, the first to translate the copperplate, believes the term &quot;tundun&quot; originated from Sanskrit, which was used alongside Malay as a language of politics and religion in the area at the time.

Before this landmark discovery, several theories (however incorrect now) existed. Philippine National Artist Nick Joaquin once suggested that it might be a reference to a high ground (&quot;tundok&quot;). On the other hand, French linguist Jean-Paul Potet, supposed that the Aegiceras corniculatum, which at the time was called &quot;tundok&quot; (&quot;tinduk-tindukan&quot; today), was the most likely origin of the name.

==History==
===Early Philippine history===
The region of Tondo has been settled by humans for over 1,100 years. Historically, Tondo already existed in the year 900 AD according to the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, a legal document that is the earliest document in the Philippines, written in Kawi script now housed in the National Museum of Anthropology.

According to this document, Tondo was ruled by an unnamed person who held the Sanskrit title of senapati or the equivalent of an admiral. Tondo was ruled by a lakan until the Spanish conquest.

===Colonial period===

After the Spaniards conquered Tondo in June 1571 they established the Province of Tondo which covered many territories in Northern Luzon particularly Pampanga, Bulacan and Rizal (formerly called Morong), with the city of Manila as its center.
In a census conducted by Miguel de Loarca in 1583, Tondo was reported to have spoken the same language as the natives of the province of Pampanga.

Institute of National Language commissioner Jose Villa Panganiban also wrote that the dividing line between Kapampangan and Tagalog was the Pasig River, and that Tondo therefore originally spoke Kapampangan. However, Fray Isacio Rodriquez&#x27;s &quot;Historia dela Provincia del Santisimo Nombre de Jesus de Filipinas&quot; stated that Provincia de Tagalos which is Tondo covers all the territories of the future Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila.
Prior to the establishment of Bulacan in 1578, Malolos and Calumpit were also included in the territory of Tondo as its &quot;visitas&quot;. By the end of the 1700s, Tondo was a populous province of 14,437 native families and 3,528 Spanish Filipino families. In 1800, the Province of Tondo was renamed to Province of Manila.

Tondo was one of the first provinces to declare rebellion against Spain in the year 1896. In 1901, under the American colonial regime, there was a major reorganization of political divisions, and the province of Tondo was dissolved, with its towns given to the provinces of Rizal and Bulacan. Today, Tondo just exists as a district in the City of Manila.

===Contemporary Period===

Slums developed in Tondo along the Pasig River. Authorities sought to improve housing conditions on these areas without condoning the squatting committed by the slums&#x27; residents. In the 1970s, the World Bank provided funds to improve conditions in Tondo which led the increase of rent prices and a property boom in the area. This led to gentrification. The slums that were upgraded were legalized but these areas remain vastly different from other parts of Manila with higher population density, more irregular road and plot patterns, and uncontrolled housing.

In the 1987 constitution, Tondo was split into two congressional districts of Manila making the first district to the west while the second district in the east.

==Economy==

Tondo hosts the Manila North Harbor Port, the northern half of the Port of Manila, the primary seaport serving Metro Manila and surrounding areas.

The area also hosted Smokey Mountain, a landfill which served Metro Manila and employed thousands of people from around the 1960s until its closure in the late 1990s. The dumpsite served as a symbol of poverty even at least two decades after its closure.

==Demographics==

Urbanization as well as the Lina Law which favors squatting over land owners has resulted in Tondo being one of the most densely populated areas in the world at .

===Crime===
Tondo has developed a reputation for criminality and poverty. In 2010, Manila records state that Tondo has the highest criminal rate in the whole city with the most common crime being pickpocketing.

===Culture===
The district celebrates the feast of the Tondo Church annually in January, which is dedicated to the image of the Santo Niño housed within the 16th-century Augustinian Tondo Church. The Lakbayaw Street Dance Festival, a competition among Ati-Atihan groups and school, local and religious groups, served as the climax of the feast.

==Education==

The Department of Education – Schools Division Office of Manila lists 26 public elementary schools and 11 public high schools in Tondo.

The Tondo Campus is a P400-million extension with 48 classrooms, 15 multifunction rooms and a gymnasium. In October 2024, Mayor Honey Lacuna and Felma Carlos-Tria led the time capsule lowering and groundbreaking of Universidad de Manilas&#x27;s 10-storey school building in a 1,500-square-meter lot at Vitas Skate Park.

<text>The Pacific swift (Apus pacificus) is a species of bird that is part of the Swift family. It breeds in eastern Asia. It is strongly migratory, spending the northern hemisphere&#x27;s winter in Southeast Asia and Australia. The general shape and blackish plumage recall its relative, the common swift, from which it is distinguished by a white rump band and heavily marked underparts. The sexes are identical in appearance, although young birds can be identified by pale fringes to the wing feathers that are absent in adults. This swift&#x27;s main call is a screech typical of its family. It is one of a group of closely related Asian swifts formerly regarded as one species.

The Pacific swift is found in a wide range of climatic zones and habitats. It breeds in sheltered locations such as caves, natural rock crevices or under the roofs of houses. The nest is a half-cup of dry grass and other fine material that is gathered in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a vertical surface. The two or three white eggs are incubated for about seventeen days to hatching. Subsequently, the chicks have a long but variable period in the nest before they are fully fledged. When the parents cannot find sufficient food in bad weather, the young can survive for days without being fed by metabolising body fat.

Like all members of its family, the Pacific swift feeds exclusively on insects caught in flight. It tends to hunt higher than most of its relatives other than the white-throated needletail. The Pacific swift has a large population and extensive breeding area, and faces few threats from predators or human activities. It is classed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It has occurred as far afield as the US and New Zealand, and it is a very rare vagrant in Europe.

==Taxonomy==
The swifts form the bird family Apodidae, which is divided into several genera. The Pacific swift is in the Old World genus &quot;Apus&quot;, which is characterised by dark, glossy plumage, a forked tail and sharply pointed wings. Until recently, the Pacific swift was considered to have five subspecies, but three have now been elevated to full species status as part of a &quot;fork-tailed swift&quot; superspecies. The proposed name of the superspecies was formerly a synonym for the Pacific swift.

A 2011 study proposed the following treatment. The long-tailed birds from the Tibetan Plateau with a narrow white throat patch are separated as Salim Ali&#x27;s swift, &quot;A. salimali&quot;, the small swifts with narrow white rumps from the Himalayas of India, Nepal and Bhutan become Blyth&#x27;s swift, &quot;A. leuconyx&quot;, and the population that breeds in limestone caves in northern Southeast Asia, characterised by a green iridescence and shallow tail fork, is split as Cook&#x27;s swift, &quot;A. cooki&quot;. The remaining subspecies are the nominate &quot;A. p. pacificus&quot; and the southern race &quot;A. p. kanoi&quot; (formerly known as &quot;kurodae&quot;). This arrangement has been accepted by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), but not the International Union for Conservation of Nature. A 2012 paper showed that &quot;cooki&quot; is closely related to the dark-rumped swift, &quot;A. acuticauda&quot;, which should therefore be included in the &quot;pacificus&quot; clade, but made no further taxonomic recommendations.

This swift was first described by John Latham in 1801 as &quot;Hirundo pacifica&quot;.
Scopoli separated the swifts from the swallows as the genus &quot;Apus&quot; in 1777. &quot;Apus&quot;, like Apodidae, is derived from the Greek απους, &quot;apous&quot;, meaning &quot;without feet&quot;, a reference to the small, weak legs of these most aerial of birds, and &quot;pacificus&quot; refers to the Pacific Ocean.

==Description==
At in length, the Pacific swift is the largest of the &quot;Apus&quot; swifts. It has a 43-to-54-cm (17-to-21-in) wingspan. Females are slightly heavier than males, averaging against . It is similar in general shape to the common swift, although slightly longer-winged and with a more protruding head. The fork of the tail is deeper, and the rump is broader. The upperparts are black, apart from a white rump band and a somewhat greyer head. The underparts are black, although white fringes to the feathers give the belly a scaly appearance when seen well from below. The tail and the upper wings are black, and the underwings are brown. The eyes are brown and the small bill and very short legs are black. The sexes are identically plumaged, and juveniles differ from the adults only in that the feathers show pale fringes, particularly on the wings. The southern subspecies, &quot;A. p. kurodae&quot;, has a narrower white rump (15 mm/0.6 in against the nominate form&#x27;s 20 mm/0.8 in), a grey throat and blacker underparts. Juveniles of migratory &quot;Apus&quot; swifts have a partial moult prior to migration, but retain the larger wing feathers. The moult is completed in the wintering grounds, where adults have a complete moult.

This species is usually straightforward to identify. The white-rumped swift is similar to Pacific swift, but its slender body and long, deeply forked tail make it appear quite different from its more powerfully built relative. A possible pitfall is a partially leucistic common swift with a white rump. The Pacific swift can be distinguished with care by its deeper tail fork, longer wings, bigger head, larger white throat patch and patterned underparts. In parts of Southeast Asia, migrating Pacific swifts pass through the resident ranges of former subspecies, and good views are then necessary to be sure of correct identification.

===Voice===
The calls given by flocks near the breeding areas are typical swift screams, including a trilled &quot;tsiririri&quot; or harsher &quot;spee-eer&quot;. They resemble the cries of the common swift, but are softer and less wheezy. Pacific swifts are less vocal on the wintering grounds, but produce a variety of twitters and buzzes.

==Distribution and habitat==
The nominate subspecies, &quot;A. p. pacificus&quot;, breeds in eastern Asia from the Ob River northeast to Kamchatka and east to the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin and Japan. It is strongly migratory, wintering in southern Indonesia, Melanesia and Australia, including Tasmania. It is a common migrant through coastal Malaysia, Sumatra and Java with &quot;vast numbers&quot; crossing the Strait of Malacca. Subspecies &quot;A. p. kurodae&quot; breeds from southeastern Tibet through eastern China to southern Japan, Taiwan and Orchid Island. It is a relatively short-distance migrant, wintering in the Philippines, Malaysia and northern Indonesia.

As a powerful long-distance migrant, the nominate subspecies of Pacific swift has occurred as a vagrant far from its normal range. Birds have been recorded from Brunei, the Maldives, New Zealand and Macquarie Island, and there have been multiple occurrences in the Seychelles. In the US, this species is casual in the Pribilof and Aleutian Islands; a claimed 2010 sighting from the Yukon will be the first for Canada and the mainland of North America if ratified. In South America, there is a 1959 record from Colombia. There are 13 European records as of 2013, from Denmark (two), Spain, Sweden (four) and the UK (seven). It is possible that this overstates the true number of visiting birds. All the listed countries had a sighting on different dates in the summer of 2013 which could be due to a single wandering bird. The four most recent English records in 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2013 all included sightings at Spurn, East Yorkshire, and may refer to one returning individual.

A mainly aerial species, this swift is not limited to particular land habitats or climatic zones; it breeds from the Arctic to sub-tropical China, and from sea level to at least in Japan. It is often found around human habitation. It tends to winter in lowlands, and in Australia it is found in arid areas as well as in towns and on the coast. Flocks of thousands may appear when there are hot strong winds. Pacific swifts often travel and feed with white-throated needletails. The Pacific swift probably sleeps in flight when not nesting, behaviour known to occur in the common swift and suspected in other &quot;Apus&quot; species, but there is an Australian record of these swifts roosting in a tree, and they are occasionally seen to land briefly on the ground or on vertical surfaces.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===
Most &quot;Apus&quot; swift species nest in rocky areas, and the majority will accept human habitations as a substitute for natural sites. The Pacific swift is a colonial species that nests in sheltered locations such as caves, crevices in vertical rock faces (including sea-cliffs), or under the eaves of houses. The nest is a half-cup of feathers, dry grass and other light vegetation collected in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a ledge or vertical surface with the same substance. Two or three eggs is the normal clutch, the number varying with geographical location. In areas where three eggs are usual, a fourth may occasionally be laid; no larger clutches are known. The eggs are white, as with all swifts, and 24–27.5 × 16–17 mm (0.95–1.08 × 0.63–0.67 in) in size. They are incubated by both parents for about 17 days prior to hatching as unfeathered and blind altricial chicks. Both adults brood and feed the chicks, which fledge in an average 40.5 days.

Swifts as a family have smaller egg clutches and much longer and more variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling tubenoses in these developmental factors. Young birds reach a maximum weight heavier than their parents; they can cope with not being fed for long periods of time, and delay their feather growth when undernourished. Swifts and seabirds have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. These adaptations mean that when conditions are good, the survival rate is very high. One large Yellow Sea colony had hatching success of 73.5%, with 63.6% of the chicks fledging. The average productivity was 1.24 fledged young per pair per year.

===Feeding===
All swifts feed on insects caught in flight, and the Pacific swift has been recorded as consuming bees, wasps, termites, moths and flies. A Chinese study found that it caught a wide variety of insect prey and considered that most of the species eaten were harmful to agriculture or forestry, leading to improved agricultural yield in a number of geographical domaines. The Pacific swift tends to hunt higher than sympatric swifts, sharing its airspace mainly with white-throated needletails. It typically feeds at heights up to , only flying close to the ground in poor weather. It often forages near low-pressure areas, which serve both to raise insects from the ground and to give the swifts additional lift. The swifts circle through the insect swarms in flocks typically of tens or hundreds of birds, although sometimes reaching tens of thousands in Australia. In Siberia, Pacific swifts feed at dusk to much later hours than the common swift, sometimes until midnight, and migrants have been seen flying with bats in the Philippines. The young are fed balls of insects bound with saliva. During bad weather, increased competition leads to malnourishment within populations, where young swifts are often not fed for days and survive on stored body fat.

==Predators and parasites==
Swifts spend most of their time in flight. Few birds have the necessary speed and agility to catch them, hobbies being the main exception. The nest sites are usually sufficiently inaccessible to be beyond the reach of snakes or mammalian predators.

This swift is host to feather mites including &quot;Eustathia cultrifera&quot;, &quot;Chauliacia canarisi&quot; and &quot;C. securigera&quot;. Biting parasites include the louse fly &quot;Crataerina pacifica&quot;, bat bugs and sucking mites. Chewing lice include two species first identified on this swift. Davaineidae tapeworms have been found as internal parasites.

== Status ==
The Pacific swift has a very large range, exceeding 10,000,000 km2 (3,800,000 mi2). Its population is unknown, although it is common throughout its breeding range with no evidence of any decline. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. There appear to be no significant threats to this bird; predation is low, and this swift is not tied to a particular habitat. Some birds may die through misadventure or become exhausted when lost on migration (the first record for the Western Palaearctic was found resting on a North Sea gas platform), but swifts have high survival rates and are generally long-lived. The common swift, a close relative of the Pacific swift, has been recorded as reaching 21 years old.

<doc id="377321" wikidata="Q3745714" url="?curid=377321" title="Finglish">
<text>The term Finglish was coined by professor Martti Nisonen in the 1920s in Hancock, Michigan, United States, to describe a mixture of Finnish and English he encountered in America. The word is first recorded in English in 1943.

As the term describes, Finglish is a macaronic mixture of the English and Finnish languages. In Finglish, the English lexical items are nativized and inserted into the framework of Finnish morphology and syntax. Many consider the adoption of English loanwords into Finnish phonology, morphology, and syntax not to be proper Finnish, but rather a language in between. The term &quot;Finglish&quot; can imply that this adoption of loanwords and usage of language is incomplete and somehow less legitimate. However, this use of loanwords and code-switching amongst bilingual speakers is typical in communities experiencing language shift. The Finnish immigrants of the United States learned English out of necessity to succeed in their jobs; the results of this resulted in what is known as Finglish. Finglish is also found in any place in Finland where international contact and popular culture exists, including Finnish language learners. This more recent (post-1980s) incorporation of English loanwords into modern Finnish as a result of globalization and advances in technology is a separate phenomenon from the North American Finnish, which developed primarily in the late 1800s to mid-1900s, though there are some similarities in form and function.

==History==
While almost all Finnish immigrants were able to read and write, it still took some time for many Finns to learn English because Finnish is a Finno-Ugric language, structurally unrelated to English and other Indo-European languages. Another reason for the delay is that many leaving Finland were farmers and laborers, and often migrated to areas of high Finnish settlement. Living and working with other Finnish speakers meant they had less need to learn English to get by in their day-to-day lives. Many other Finnish immigrants ended up in menial and industrial jobs, where they learned English through practice in order to get by in the workplace. Second- and third-generation Finnish Americans often learned to speak both Finnish and English, though the Finnish they learned differed from that spoken in Finland. This was due to a variety of reasons, including competing language inputs between Finnish and English and the fact that their Finnish input may have been different from that considered standard in Finland. Finglish originated amongst these first- and second-generation Finnish immigrants in US and Canada. The English language skills of the first-generation American Finns tended to be limited; second- and third-generation American Finns usually were more or less bilingual. Finglish emerged as a pidgin with something they already knew (Finnish) and something they were bound to learn (English).

As has been documented for several immigrant languages, one would expect that over time North American Finnish would reduce its inflectional system in favor of prepositions and analytic constructions. Nominal morphology is particularly vulnerable in heritage languages with robust morphology. As heritage speakers tend to become fluent in the majority language while never achieving native fluency in the heritage language, second- and third-generation speakers who learn the minority language from the first generation may not acquire the full inflectional system of the language spoken in the country of origin. The majority language may also influence the syntax and other features of the heritage language. Thus, North American Finnish differed not only in the lexical items used, but in aspects of morphology and syntax as well.

The majority of immigrants to America came from Ostrobothnia and the Northern Ostrobothnia areas in western Finland; over sixty percent of all emigrants who left the country between 1893 and 1920 came from Vaasa and Oulu. Many other Finnish immigrants were from the provinces of Savonia and Tavastia, and the Finnish spoken in North America also reflects those dialects.

==History of research==
Much work has been done in the last fifty years to document the speech of Finnish Americans in the United States and Canada, though little new data has been brought forward in the last 25 years. Pertti Virtaranta did extensive research on the Finnish spoken in North America, particularly in the Upper Midwest and Canada, taking three trips from 1965 to 1980 to interview speakers. The interviews had standard questions asked of everyone, including why they (or their families) left Finland, what the trip was like, and what it was like to find a job once in America. Otherwise, the interviews consisted of free conversation on whatever subject the participants found most interesting. Maisa Martin wrote a dissertation on the phonology and morphology of American Finnish where she discusses the borrowings and changes between Finland Finnish and American Finnish. Donald Larmouth did extensive research on the Finnish used by four generations in rural Finnish communities in northern Minnesota, interviewing a total of 62 respondents. In his interviews he elicits personal narratives, has participants complete picture identification tasks with simple cartoons, and give translations of sentences. He documents what changes the language seems to have undergone, notably the leveling of several cases including the accusative and partitive. 
This previous work on American Finnish reveals a lower frequency of accusative case and partitive case in heritage bilingual speakers, with more pronounced changes the farther removed the generation was from the immigrant generation. In his interviews he elicits personal narratives, has participants complete picture identification tasks with simple cartoons, and give translations of sentences. While the partitive and accusative were vulnerable, other cases, including the illative and ablative, remained robust in the speech of these speakers, though adjective case endings were especially prone to deletion. These previous works focus primarily on Finnish speakers in Minnesota and Michigan, with Wisconsin underrepresented.

The most common characteristic of historical Finglish were (in descending order of frequency):

Words used in US Finglish often have completely different meanings in Finnish, especially when the Finglish terms are borrowings from English; they have become expressive loans: (from and meaning &#x27;room&#x27;; in Finnish meaning &#x27;cargo hold&#x27;), (&#x27;beer&#x27;; &#x27;district&#x27;), (&#x27;to play&#x27;; &#x27;to hover&#x27;), (&#x27;crazy&#x27;; &#x27;thigh&#x27;), and (&#x27;stove&#x27;; &#x27;halyard&#x27;). US Finglish compound words can produce combinations completely incomprehensible to native Finnish speakers, like (&#x27;beer keg&#x27;; &#x27;district cuckoo&#x27;) or the somewhat less incomprehensible (&#x27;flight attendant&#x27;; &#x27;air maid&#x27;).

These older Finglish usages may not be bound to survive, and their original users are now in their 80s and 90s. The descendants of most American Finns are today either completely monolingual, or, if they have kept their ties to their grandparents&#x27; and great-grandparents&#x27; speech, use ordinary Finnish beside English.

Example of old-style Finglish:

which translates as

For comparison, standard Finnish without anglicisms:

Relatively few words from Finglish have become standard Finnish, but note &#x27;log cabin&#x27; or &#x27;(temporary) accommodation&#x27;, from English &quot;camp&quot;; and &#x27;miner&#x27;. These may, however, be direct borrowings from English in Finland.

==Later Finglish==
A new wave of Finglish has originated in Finland. Its sources are technology, popular culture, various sub-cultures, and fandom. It differs from slang in the sense that it also uses some English linguistic structures. Examples of some popular-culture Finglish expressions include (&#x27;to work&#x27;), (&#x27;beach&#x27;), (&#x27;to spray&#x27;), (&#x27;to hang out&#x27;), (&#x27;to cruise in an automobile&#x27;) and (&#x27;heavy user&#x27;). While the earlier, North American Finglish was distinctively a working-class adult immigrants&#x27; language, the newer sort of Finglish is used by native Finnish youth in contact with the English language through mass and social media. Finglish terms of today are a transitional phase of absorption of new terms and ideas from English into mainstream Finnish before the full nativization of the words, especially in situations where English (a very productive yet compounding language) expresses a concept with one word, while Finnish would require several of them, or has no native term. This Finglish is not to be confused with Helsinki slang, though the latter has absorbed some English loan words, too, in recent times.

The characteristics of current Finglish, in descending order of frequency, are:
An example of today&#x27;s Finglish might be:

which translates as

For comparison, without anglicisms, but still colloquial:

And, in more literary Finnish:

==Technical speech==
Finglish is today used most commonly in technology-related speech, where the majority of the loanwords originate in English. Since the English and Finnish language morphologies are vastly different and English pronunciation seldom fits in the Finnish speech immediately, the loan&#x27;s orthography and pronunciation are nativized. Direct Finglish (&#x27;techspeak&#x27;) expressions include (&#x27;printer&#x27; – it is currently being ousted by the native word ), &#x27;modem&#x27;, and or (&#x27;processor&#x27; – there is even a puristic word, , which is heard often enough, but is still less common than the borrowings). Reified initialisms in Finglish include from English &quot;CPU&quot;, and from &quot;DIMM&quot;. Finglish is usually considered a transitional phase from literal loans into translationary loans (calques). Examples of Finglish calques are &#x27;motherboard&#x27;, &#x27;display&#x27;, &#x27;to outsource&#x27;, and (&#x27;electronic mail&#x27; – the Finglish words [which, capitalized, is also a male name, the Finnish version of Emil]; or are still quite common). An example of a word where the transition is partial, is &#x27;Web browser&#x27;, where the word &quot;web&quot; has not yet been translated into Finnish ( is however now the standard term and is widely used).

An example of Finnish techspeak:

which would translate in English to:

and a less anglicised, but still colloquial Finnish:

An approximation in literary Finnish:

==Neologisms==
Sometimes English words are used as the basis of Finnish conceptual neologisms, like &#x27;computer enthusiast&#x27;, from English &quot;nerd&quot;; or , , or &#x27;newbie&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;beginner&#x27; (the first two variants influenced by the native Finnish , meaning a &#x27;freak&#x27; or &#x27;eccentric person&#x27;).

Since most current Finglish users are fluent in Finnish and to some extent English, direct translations are sometimes used in humorous or oxymoronic concepts, such as (literally &#x27;public house&#x27;) for (borrowed long ago from English), or (lit. &#x27;practical joke&#x27;) for native Finnish (&#x27;prank&#x27;, &#x27;shenanigan&#x27;).

English loanwords that originate in Latin are usually amalgamated in Finnish by using the Latin and not English orthography and grammar.

<doc id="377332" wikidata="Q354125" url="?curid=377332" title="William Manchester">
<text>William Raymond Manchester (April 1, 1922 – June 1, 2004) was an American author, biographer, and historian. He was the author of 18 books which have been translated into over 20 languages. He was awarded the National Humanities Medal and the Abraham Lincoln Literary Award.

==Early life and education==
Manchester was born in Attleboro, Massachusetts, and grew up in Springfield, Massachusetts. His father served in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War I. 

After his father&#x27;s death and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Manchester likewise enlisted in the Marine Corps. However, he was ordered back to college until called up. Initially, Manchester joined the Officer Candidate School but was dropped before receiving a commission. After being given the rank of corporal, he was sent to Guadalcanal in 1944 for further training. Although he had expected to serve in Europe, Manchester ultimately found himself in the Pacific Theater. He served in the Battle of Okinawa, was severely wounded on June 5, 1945, and was promoted to sergeant in July and awarded the Purple Heart. 

Following World War II, Manchester worked as a copyboy for the &quot;Daily Oklahoman&quot; in 1945 before returning to college. In 1946, he completed his B.A. from Massachusetts State College, where he was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. In 1947, he earned his master&#x27;s degree from the University of Missouri.

==Career==
===Journalism===
In 1947, Manchester went to work as a reporter for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, where he met journalist H. L. Mencken, who became his friend and mentor, and also became the subject of Manchester&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis and first book, &quot;Disturber of the Peace&quot;. The biography, published in 1951, profiles Mencken, the self-described &quot;conservative anarchist&quot; who made his mark as a writer, editor, and political pundit in the 1920s. In 1953, Manchester published his novel &quot;The City of Anger&quot;, set in Baltimore and dealing with inner city life and the numbers racket, subjects Manchester had learned about as a big city reporter.

===Academia===
In 1955, Manchester became an editor for Wesleyan University and the Wesleyan University Press and spent the rest of his career at the university. For the academic year 1959–1960, he was a Fellow on the faculty at the Center for Advanced Studies of Wesleyan. He later became an adjunct professor of history, adjunct professor emeritus, and writer-in-residence at the university. During his association with Wesleyan University, Manchester developed an intense writing regimen that he adhered to for much of his life, often writing nonstop for up to 50 hours at a time. He described the experience as follows: &quot;I would work all day, all night, all the next day, all the following night and into the third day. I would look up at the clock, and it would be 3:30 in the afternoon, and I would say, &#x27;Oh boy, I&#x27;ve got three more hours to write.&#x27; I just loved it.&quot;

===Author===
Manchester&#x27;s wartime experiences formed the basis for his very personal account of the Pacific Theater, &quot;Goodbye, Darkness: A Memoir of the Pacific War&quot;. In this memoir, Manchester used personal anecdotes from his service on Okinawa in his descriptions of battles on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, and Saipan. Manchester&#x27;s portrayal of his wartime service, his section in combat, and his injuries are literary devices. He stated this in the end notes, as well as denying any attempt at a chronological account. Later examination of his personal papers, his wartime record, and his medical records show that much of what he recounted was inaccurate. 

Manchester also wrote of World War II in several other books, including a three-part biography, &quot;The Last Lion&quot;, of Winston Churchill. Manchester also wrote a biography of General Douglas MacArthur, &quot;American Caesar&quot;. 

His best-selling book, &quot;The Death of a President&quot; (1967), is a detailed account of the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy, who had been the subject of an earlier book by Manchester. In 1964, Manchester was commissioned by the Kennedy family to write the book. Manchester, who retraced the movements of President Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald before the assassination, tentatively concluded, based on his study of Oswald&#x27;s psychology and their similar training as Marine sharpshooters, that Oswald had acted alone. Manchester had the support of Robert and Jacqueline Kennedy, but later had a falling-out with Robert over Manchester&#x27;s treatment of President Lyndon B. Johnson.

Before the book could be published, Jacqueline Kennedy filed a lawsuit to prevent its publication, even though she had previously authorized it. The suit was settled in 1967, reportedly with Manchester&#x27;s agreeing to drop certain passages dealing with details of Kennedy&#x27;s family life. In response satirist Paul Krassner published a piece entitled &quot;The Parts That Were Left Out of the Kennedy Book&quot;, which imagined scandalous censored material. In his collection of essays &quot;Controversy&quot; (1977), Manchester detailed Kennedy&#x27;s attempts to suppress the book. The book was a best-seller at release, but was allowed to go out of print until 1988. It was re-issued in October 2013.

Following the death of his wife in 1998, Manchester suffered two strokes. Manchester told his publishers that he would not be able to complete the planned third volume of his three part-biography of Churchill, &quot;The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill: Defender of the Realm, 1940-1965&quot;. Manchester was initially reluctant to collaborate with anyone to finish the work, but in October 2003, he asked Paul Reid, a friend and writer for &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot;, to complete the Churchill biography. After Manchester&#x27;s death, Reid completed the third volume using Manchester&#x27;s notes and writing. 

==Awards==
In 2001, President George W. Bush presented Manchester with the National Humanities Medal. In an interview conducted with a writer who was preparing capsule biographies of NEH medal recipients, Manchester stated that he had been valedictorian of his class at the University of Massachusetts and that he had received the Silver Star and two Purple Hearts; however, a 2017 article in the intellectual review &quot;The American Spectator&quot; asserted that none of this was true. 

Manchester was also the recipient of the Abraham Lincoln Literary Award, among other awards.

==Personal life==
Manchester married Julia Brown Marshall on March 27, 1948, known as Judy, and they had one son, music composer John and two daughters, Julie, and Laurie. 

==Death==
Manchester died at the age of 82 on June 1, 2004, and is interred at Indian Hill Cemetery in Middletown, Connecticut.

<text>Karenjit &quot;Karen&quot; Kaur Vohra (born May 13, 1981), known by her stage name Sunny Leone, is a Canadian American actress, model, and former pornographic actress. She was named &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet of the Year in 2003, was a contract performer for Vivid Entertainment, and was named by &quot;Maxim&quot; as one of the 12 top porn stars in 2010. She was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame in 2018.

She has played roles in independent mainstream events, films, and television series. Her first mainstream appearance was in 2005, when she worked as a red carpet reporter for the MTV Video Music Awards on MTV India. In 2011, she participated in the Indian reality television series &quot;Bigg Boss&quot;. She also has hosted the Indian reality show &quot;Splitsvilla&quot;.

In 2012, she made her Bollywood debut in Pooja Bhatt&#x27;s erotic thriller &quot;Jism 2&quot; (2012) and shifted her focus to mainstream acting which was followed up with &quot;Jackpot&quot; (2013), &quot;Ragini MMS 2&quot; (2014), &quot;Ek Paheli Leela&quot; (2015), &quot;Tera Intezaar&quot; (2017), and the Malayalam film &quot;Madhura Raja&quot; in 2019.

Apart from her acting career, she has been part of activism campaigns including the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Los Angeles Half-Marathon to raise money for the American Cancer Society and has also posed for a People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) ad campaign with a rescued dog, encouraging pet owners to have their cats and dogs spayed and neutered.

== Early life ==
Karenjit Kaur Vohra was born on May 13, 1981, in Sarnia, Ontario, to Sikh Indian Punjabi parents. As a young girl, she was a self-described tomboy, very athletic and played street hockey with the boys.

Although the family was Sikh, her parents enrolled her in Catholic school as it was felt to be unsafe for her to go to public school. When she was 13, her family moved to Fort Gratiot, Michigan, then to Lake Forest, California, a year later, fulfilling her grandparents&#x27; dream that the family be together in one place. She had her first kiss at 11, lost her virginity at 16 with a basketball player, and discovered her bisexuality at 18.

== Pornographic career ==
Before working in the porn industry, Leone worked at a German bakery, a Jiffy Lube store, and later a tax and retirement firm. She was also studying to become a nurse.
When picking a name for her adult career, Leone has stated that Sunny is her real name and that Leone was picked by Bob Guccione, former owner of &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine. After posing for that magazine, she was named &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet of the Month for the March 2001 issue, followed by a feature in the Holiday 2001 edition of &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine as a Hustler Honey. She has also appeared in other magazines including &quot;Cheri&quot;, &quot;Mystique Magazine&quot;, &quot;High Society&quot;, &quot;Swank&quot;, &quot;AVN Online&quot;, &quot;Leg World&quot;, &quot;Club International&quot; and &quot;Lowrider&quot;, while her online credits include ModFX Models, Suze Randall, Ken Marcus and Mac &amp; Bumble.

In 2003, she was named &quot;Penthouse Pet of the Year&quot; and starred in the video &quot;Penthouse Pets in Paradise&quot; alongside Tera Patrick and Kyla Cole. In 2005 Adam &amp; Eve appointed her as their West Coast Internet Sales Representative.
That same year, Leone signed a three-year contract with Vivid Entertainment with which she transitioned into hardcore pornography, stating that she would only do lesbian scenes. Her first movie released was titled &quot;Sunny&quot;, and was released in December 2005. Her next movie, &quot;Virtual Vivid Girl Sunny Leone&quot;, was the first interactive title for Leone, who was the first Vivid Girl to make such a movie. Taking only four days to film, the movie won her first AVN Award (Best Interactive DVD). She followed this with &quot;Sunny Loves Cher&quot;, which featured her first on-screen squirting, and &quot;The Female Gardner&quot; co-starring Mikayla Mendez and Daisy Marie.

Leone&#x27;s last two movies under her contract with Vivid were &quot;It&#x27;s Sunny in Brazil&quot;, which was filmed in Brazil, and &quot;The Sunny Experiment&quot;. The movies were released in October and December 2007, respectively.

In May 2007, upon re-signing her contract with Vivid for another six films, Leone agreed to do her first boy/girl scenes, though only with her fiancé, Matt Erikson. That year she underwent breast augmentation, and shot her first movie under the new contract titled &quot;Sunny Loves Matt&quot;. For that film she was nominated for three (out of six) AVN awards in 2009, in addition to being a choice for Female Performer of the Year. She followed up her first boy-girl title with &quot;The Other Side of Sunny&quot; in October 2008, which would be the last time she would perform with Erikson.

In January 2008, Leone revealed that she was no longer exclusive to Erikson, and had done scenes with other actors, including Tommy Gunn, Charles Dera, James Deen and Voodoo.

In 2009, Vivid released her only adult movie performing with multiple male actors, titled &quot;Sunny B/G Adventure&quot;. Her final release under contract with Vivid – &quot;Undress Me&quot;, once again made her exclusive to performing with just one male actor, Daniel Weber (he performed under the stage name Ariel King), who subsequently became her husband.

In August 2009, she announced the launch of her own studio, Sunlust Pictures, with Daniel Weber as her partner. With her new venture Leone announced her plans to write, direct and create her own brand of adult movies with Vivid Entertainment as her distributor. Her first independent production, &quot;The Dark Side of the Sun&quot;, was released in March 2009, and was debuted at the Erotic Heritage Museum in Las Vegas. In June 2009, she held a casting call in Las Vegas for her second independent production titled &quot;Sunny Slumber Party&quot;, which was released in September 2009. She followed up with three other self-produced features; &quot;Gia Portrait of a Porn Star&quot; (2010) which was nominated for multiple AVN awards, &quot;Roleplay&quot; (2011) and &quot;Goddess&quot; (2012) which featured her first anal sex scene.

No longer exclusive to Vivid, Leone began working with other studios and performers since 2009. She leveraged her online popularity by striking deals with firms like PPPcard, AdultPokerParty.com, Brickhouse, Flirt4Free, Totemcash, and Imlive to sell and distribute her content over the Internet and other media. She won the &quot;Web Babe of the Year&quot; at the 2008 Xbiz Awards. Her websites and business interests are run under her banner company Leone L.L.C. She indicated in an April 2012 interview that 80 per cent of the traffic on her website, and 60 per cent of her revenue comes from India.

Leone was part of the Vivid Comedy Tour, and has modelled for the Vivid Footwear collection. Leone has also participated in events like the Vivid/ClubJenna Lingerie Bowl and Vivid&#x27;s Hot Rod Night. Doc Johnson launched a pocket pal in 2006 moulded to her vagina, and in 2008 released the Sunny Leone Exciter vibrator. Control MFG used Leone&#x27;s image along with other Vivid girls to market their line of skateboards. She is paired with Gab Ekoe, one of the Team Control riders. She also indicated that she plans to launch her own line of lingerie and other Sunny-branded products including a diamond jewellery line.

In September 2009, an iPhone application consisting of a collection of non-nude photos, some videos and a porn star-penned blog was approved by Apple for sale in the iTunes store, making it the first officially sanctioned application featuring a porn actor. By February 2010, the app had been removed by Apple from the store.

Leone was voted number 13 (up from number 41 in 2007) on &quot;Genesis&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Porn stars&quot; list, number 34 on Desiclubs.com&#x27;s Top 50 Coolest Desis of 2004, and one of the &quot;40 under 40&quot; ranking on &quot;AVN Online&quot; magazine. In 2010, she was named by &quot;Maxim&quot; as one of the 12 top female stars in porn. She was voted number 82 in the Top 99 Women for 2012 in AskMen.com&#x27;s list.

In 2013, she announced her retirement from the adult industry, stating: &quot;I am lucky that the audience is accepting me. I have come my way from there (porn industry). I don&#x27;t have any plans as of now to go back there.&quot;

In 2016, she was chosen as one of BBC&#x27;s 100 Women. The tech magazine &quot;Exhibit&quot; chose Leone for their cover girl of the October 2016 issue.

== Mainstream appearances prior to 2011 ==
Leone&#x27;s first mainstream appearance was in 2005, when she was a red carpet reporter for the MTV Awards on MTV India. She has also had a cameo in the film &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot;, performed in Ja Rule&#x27;s video &quot;Livin&#x27; It Up&quot;, and a video for Kidd Skilly. Other credits include E!&#x27;s &quot;Wild On!&quot; and the Sundance Film Festival&#x27;s &quot;After Dark&quot;. Leone was a contestant in the second season of the Fox reality show &quot;My Bare Lady 2: Open for Business&quot;, in which a group of adult actresses were given classes and training on how to pitch investment ideas and competed for success in the business world. In addition to filming her scene for &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; in 2007, Leone was also part of a Showtime documentary of the same name detailing the production of the movie and the personal lives of its stars.

She indicated that for the right price she would seriously consider a career in Bollywood. She was courted by Indian directors in the past but felt uncomfortable with the roles that she would have played. Director Mohit Suri reportedly asked Leone to play the lead role in his film &quot;Kalyug&quot;, but instead cast Deepal Shaw as he could not afford Leone&#x27;s $1 million acting fee. She has mentioned that Aamir Khan is her favorite Bollywood actor, and that over 60% of her fans are from South Asia.

In 2008, Leone announced that she would be starring in a mainstream action adventure movie titled &quot;Pirates Blood&quot;, which was shot in Oman. The shooting was completed in two weeks and was to be released in winter 2008. Leone also landed a role in &quot;Middle Men&quot;, producer Chris Mallick&#x27;s indie feature about the birth of the online porn industry set for wide theatrical release in 2009. She appeared in the 2010 film &quot;The Virginity Hit&quot; playing a version of herself, where she is hired to take the virginity of the lead character.

Leone has made appearances at events such as the 2002 SEMA International Auto Salon, the 2002 Extreme Autofest Pomona and the 2006 World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. She also served as hostess at events in clubs like the Mansion in Miami and the Highlands in Hollywood.

In 2005, she was mentioned in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine for a story on Vivid Entertainment. Leone has also been featured in mainstream publications like &quot;FHM&quot;, &quot;Front&quot; and &quot;Jane&quot; magazine. In 2007, along with the other Vivid Girls, she was seen in a 48&#x27; high holiday billboard in Times Square at W. 48th Street and Seventh Avenue. She is among the &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pets who appears in the 2007 video game &quot;Pocket Pool&quot;, and was featured in a coffee table book titled &quot;Naked Ambition: An R Rated Look at an X Rated Industry&quot; by Michael Grecco.

== Indian film career ==

=== &quot;Bigg Boss&quot; and entry into Bollywood (2011–2013) ===

In 2011, she participated in the Indian reality series &quot;Bigg Boss 5&quot;, entering the house on day 49. However, she refused to divulge her porn star status, and replied to fellow house-mate Pooja Bedi that she was a model and a TV star in America for the last ten years or so. It was reported that she caused a stir in the larger populace with her Twitter feed gaining 8,000 new followers in just 2 days and Google saying searches for her experienced a &quot;breakout&quot;. There were also complaints lodged with the Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting alleging that the Colors TV channel was promoting pornography by having Leone appear on the show; among those who filed are the Indian Artistes and Actors Forum and Anurag Thakur, member of Lok Sabha and head of the Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s youth wing. She was evicted on Day 91.
During her stay in the &quot;Bigg Boss&quot; house, Leone was approached by Bollywood film-maker Mahesh Bhatt who entered the house briefly to offer her the lead role in Dino Morea&#x27;s &quot;Jism 2&quot; (the sequel to the 2003 film &quot;Jism&quot;). She accepted it, which resulted in Pooja Bhatt&#x27;s production house, Fish Eye Network and Leone&#x27;s agent discussing the movie further. Leone entered Bollywood in 2012 with the film &quot;Jism 2&quot; to weak critical reception but was commercially successful.
Sunny Leone signed her second Bollywood film, &quot;Ragini MMS 2&quot;, sequel to Ekta Kapoor&#x27;s crossover horror movie &quot;Ragini MMS&quot;. Sunny Leone featured in an item number in the Sanjay Gupta and Ekta Kapoor&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;Shootout at Wadala&quot;. Her next role was for Kaizad Gustad&#x27;s &quot;Jackpot&quot; which was panned by critics.

=== &quot;Ragini MMS 2&quot; and further success (2014–present) ===

Her first release of 2014 was the much anticipated horror film &quot;Ragini MMS 2&quot;, which proved to be a box-office hit. Leone&#x27;s performance received all round praise with critic Mohar Basu calling her work a &quot;revelation&quot;. Critic Taran Adarsh also noted that Leone, &quot;carries off her character with supreme confidence&quot;. In November 2013, she had confirmed that she would make her Tamil film debut in &quot;Vadacurry&quot; which released in May 2014 and featured her in a special appearance. She next appeared in the item number &quot;Pink Lips&quot; for the film &quot;Hate Story 2&quot;. After giving a hit number &quot;Pink Lips&quot;, she appeared once again in &quot;Shake That Booty&quot; opposite Mika Singh from his film &quot;Balwinder Singh Famous Ho Gaya&quot;. She made her acting debut in the Telugu film industry by appearing in a cameo in &quot;Current Theega&quot; opposite Manchu Manoj and Rakul Preet Singh where she played a school teacher.

Leone then appeared in item song &quot;Sesamma Bagilu Tegiyamma&quot; in Kannada film &quot;DK&quot;, which marked her debut in Kannada film industry.

== Writer ==
&quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; is a collection of 12 short stories written by Sunny Leone. They were published digitally as an e-book and launched on April 22, 2016, by Juggernaut Books through their mobile app. A story was made available on the app at 10pm every night. A 200-page paperback edition was also launched in 2016.

The work was well received by the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, which commented, &quot;Sunny&#x27;s stories are relentlessly optimistic. The characters are not complicated or unpleasant and exist in a world that veers on the border of Valentine&#x27;s Land with its floating pink hearts and soft focus lighting.&quot;

In an interview to Press Trust of India, Leone explained that the book was written from the perspective of both men and females, and that while it was for both genders it was mainly intended for women, stating, &quot;I wrote these stories, from what I thought a woman would like to read.&quot; Sunny Leone add that it is &quot;the first time (she has) written something like this.&quot; In the interview she mentioned how Juggernaut Books had come to her with this idea of writing the book.

&quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; was &quot;Elle&quot;″s Book of the Week in April 2016. The publication wrote, &quot;Don&#x27;t go looking for creative fantasies or fetishes; as a writer, Leone is playing safe.&quot; Another review in &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; goes on to note if there was any real contribution from Sunny herself towards the book other than her picture on the cover. The review goes on say that there is &quot;no note by (the) author, acknowledgments section, or forward from some known entity.&quot;

== Activism ==

In 2004, Leone was part of &quot;No More Bush Girls&quot;, in which she and several other popular adult actresses shaved off their pubic hair in protest of the George W. Bush presidency. In May 2008, she shot a promotional video for Declare Yourself, a nonprofit, nonpartisan voter registration campaign targeting 18- to 29-year-olds. She indicated that Barack Obama would be her choice in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, primarily because she felt he was more business-friendly to the adult industry than his opponent John McCain. She also released a public service announcement on behalf of the ASACP, urging adult website webmasters to protect their sites from children by having an RTA label on it.

In 2013, Leone posed for a PETA ad campaign, encouraging dog and cat owners to have their pets spayed and neutered. In an interview for PETA India, Leone said, &quot;I believe that every single dog should be spayed and neutered. You don&#x27;t want to continue the cycle of homeless dogs or cats. And spaying and neutering also keeps them healthy.&quot; PETA named her their &quot;Person of the Year&quot; in 2016.

== Personal life ==
In June 2006, Leone became an American citizen, but stated she planned to remain a dual citizen of Canada. On April 14, 2012, she announced that she was now a resident of India, explaining in an interview to &quot;The New Indian Express&quot; that she was an Overseas Citizen of India for which she was eligible because her parents lived in India. She applied for it prior to filming &quot;Jism 2&quot;.

Leone is left handed.

Leone has a strong interest in health and fitness and has been featured in several mainstream fitness publications. Leone has modelled fitness clothing for the sports brand Fantasy Fitness and shared that she stays in shape by working out as much as she can despite her busy schedule, commenting in &quot;Men&#x27;s Fitness&quot; magazine, &quot;I try to eat very healthy – lots of vegetables, drinking milk every day.&quot;

A 2008 &quot;Eye Weekly&quot; article reported that &quot;Leone does her best to maintain a link to Sikh traditions, even if more in theory than in practice. But she&#x27;s unlikely to disavow her career path due to religion&quot; and that Leone said &quot;Girls will leave the industry claiming that they found God. Well, the fact is, God has always been with them the entire time.&quot; In a 2010 interview, she said

=== Marriage and family ===
Although bisexual, she has stated that she prefers men. Sunny Leone had dated Indian-Canadian stand-up comedian Russell Peters up until they broke up in 2007. Leone was then dating Matt Erikson, a vice-president of marketing at Playboy Enterprises. After being engaged to Erikson, they broke up in 2008. She mentioned in an interview at the start of 2011 that she was married to Daniel Weber, an American actor, producer, and entrepreneur. During her stay in the &quot;Bigg Boss&quot; house later that same year, Leone indicated that she had married, Leone said she &quot;purposely arrived late&quot; to their first date as she was not impressed with him, but he changed her mind by sending 24 roses to her hotel room.

In July 2017, Leone and her husband Daniel Weber adopted their first child from Latur, a village in Maharashtra. The baby girl, whom they named Nisha Kaur Weber, was 21 months old at the time of adoption. Actress Sherlyn Chopra confirmed the news by writing a congratulatory message on social media on July 20, 2017. &quot;Never in my life did I think that I want to adopt a child. People doing such amazing work at the orphanage changed my mind,&quot; Daniel Weber told &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;.

On March 4, 2018, Leone and her husband announced the birth of their twin boys, born through surrogacy. They named the boys Asher Singh Weber and Noah Singh Weber.

Leone and her family moved into a new home in Mumbai, Maharashtra on Ganesh Chaturthi, which took place on September 13, 2018.

== Controversies ==
A police first information report was filed against Leone in May 2015 after a woman at Mumbai, India, complained that Leone&#x27;s website, sunnyleone.com, was destroying the Indian culture. Thane police&#x27;s cyber cell at Ramnagar booked her for sections 292, 292A, 294, which could have landed her a term in jail, a fine, or both. Senior police inspector JK Sawant stated, &quot;We cannot block the website, but will ask the operator to remove objectionable content.&quot;

Producer and distributor Bharat Patel has accused Leone of not returning a signing fee which she had taken to do a special dance number for his film &quot;Patel Ki Punjabi Shaadi&quot; after her role was cancelled.

<doc id="377339" wikidata="Q515748" url="?curid=377339" title="Santa Barbara Municipal Airport">
<text>Santa Barbara Municipal Airport is west of downtown Santa Barbara, California, United States. The airfield covers of land and has three runways.

It is near the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the city of Goleta. The airport was annexed to the city of Santa Barbara by a , corridor, mostly under the Pacific Ocean (a shoestring annexation). Most of the airport is above sea level and borders a wetland area, the Goleta Slough.

In 2019, the airport was categorized as a &quot;small hub primary airport&quot; by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with 510,141 enplanements. As of December 2024, the airport is served by Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.

==History==

===Early years ===
Aviation in the area began in 1914 when Lincoln J. Beachey flew an airplane across Goleta Valley. Two years later the Loughead brothers, who later changed their name to Lockheed, established a seaplane factory on State Street (Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company) and constructed a wooden ramp on West Beach to launch their planes. In 1928, Gordon Sackett and Royce Stetson landed a Hisso-powered airplane in a cow pasture near the corner of Hollister and Fairview Avenues and set up a flight school. That first airstrip marked the beginning of what was to become the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.

As airplane manufacturing grew in the late 1930s the airstrip developed into an airfield. Western General set up shop and began producing Meteor airplanes, while Santa Barbara Airways&#x27; founder Frederick Stearns II built two additional runways and two large hangars. Stearns also installed the first radio equipment at the airfield.

As war approached the United States Government established a program to build 250 airports across the country on a cost-sharing basis with local governments. Thomas M. Storke secured Santa Barbara&#x27;s enrollment in the program, and in 1941 groundbreaking ceremonies were held for the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.

With the outbreak of WWII the airport became MCAS Santa Barbara (Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara) in 1942, an aviator training base for the U.S Marines. It was expanded further with the addition of many hangars and other buildings, and reverted to a civilian airport in 1946.
The original Spanish-style terminal building, commissioned by United Airlines in 1942 was designed by William Edwards and Joseph Plunkett, an architectural team whose work, including the Arlington Theatre and the National Armory, helped shape the Mediterranean style of the city.

===Postwar developments===
In 1947 the Santa Barbara Flying Club was formed to promote general aviation in the region.

Three runways are in use: 7/25 and two parallel runways 15/33. The airport originally had an additional strip: runway 3/21. The development of the University of California, Santa Barbara (to the southwest) and the construction of hangars in support of production of the Aero Spacelines Super Guppy (to the northeast) were factors in the removal of this runway.


Additions to the historic terminal made in 1967 and 1976 were removed and the original building was restored. It then was raised to meet modern flood plain regulations, and moved and incorporated into the new terminal. The aircraft parking ramp was redesigned, and a new loop road and short term parking lot were constructed. The new terminal building features many environmentally sustainable elements and is registered with the U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). It was originally designed to feature four glass passenger boarding bridges and four hardstands, but due to decreased flight activity, three jetbridges were constructed with five hardstands.

An Airport Master Plan was prepared in 2017. In late 2019, the fourth boarding bridge was installed to replace a hardstand to help the airport cope with increased flight activity and upgauging. Relocation of the car rental lot also allowed all four jetbridges to accommodate mainline aircraft, up from two previously.

== Airlines and destinations ==

Airline flights began in 1932 on Pacific Seaboard Air Lines. In 1933, Pacific Seaboard was operating two daily round trip flights with single engine Bellanca CH-300s Los Angeles–Santa Barbara–Santa Maria–San Luis Obispo–Paso Robles–Monterey–Salinas–San Jose–San Francisco. Pacific Seaboard later moved its entire operation to the eastern U.S. and became Chicago and Southern Air Lines, a large domestic and international airline acquired by and merged into Delta Air Lines in 1953. United Airlines began flights from Santa Barbara/Goleta in 1936.

===Southwest Airways and successors===

Until 2002, Santa Barbara Airport was on a jet route to San Francisco and Los Angeles. The airport was served by Southwest Airways Douglas DC-3s and Martin 4-0-4s and by successors Pacific Air Lines, Air West and Hughes Airwest with Fairchild F-27s and Boeing 727-100, Douglas DC-9-10 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jets. The Southwest March 1, 1947, timetable lists two round trip Douglas DC-3s flying Los Angeles–Oxnard–Santa Barbara–Santa Maria–San Luis Obispo–Coalinga–Monterey–Santa Cruz/Watsonville–San Jose–San Francisco. Pacific Air Lines operated the first jet service into Santa Barbara in 1966 with Boeing 727-100s; the January 4, 1967, timetable lists 727s flying San Francisco–Monterey–Santa Barbara–Los Angeles. Air West served the airport with the B727-100s formerly operated by Pacific Air Lines while Hughes Airwest served Santa Barbara with Douglas DC-9-10s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s.

===United===
The United Airlines timetable dated February 1, 1937, listed a daily service operated with a Douglas DC-3 on a routing of Los Angeles–Santa Barbara–San Francisco–Oakland and back. By 1972 the United timetable listed direct Boeing 727-100s to New York/Newark via LAX and Milwaukee. The primary United routes from Santa Barbara were nonstops to Los Angeles and San Francisco with some continuing to other cities. The first nonstop flights beyond California were United Boeing 727s to Denver in 1979 and to Chicago O&#x27;Hare in 1980. United ceased mainline jet service to SBA in 1990. Shuttle by United, a division of United Airlines (later renamed United Shuttle) flew Boeing 737-300s and 737-500s to San Francisco in the 1990s and early 2000s. United then turned all service over to SkyWest Airlines, which now operates as United Express. Service was originally operated with Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia commuter propjets to SFO and LAX and CRJ200 regional jets to Denver. This was later turned over to a mix of SkyWest CRJ200, CRJ700, and E175 regional jet aircraft. On June 8, 2017, United resumed seasonal mainline service to San Francisco and Denver. On June 3, 2021, United via United Express resumed nonstop service to Chicago O&#x27;Hare.

===American===
American Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-80s started flying to Dallas/Fort Worth in 1984, some on a triangle route DFW–Burbank–SBA–DFW or DFW–Bakersfield–SBA–DFW. American also flew MD-80s to Chicago O&#x27;Hare via Ontario. After American Airlines dropped mainline service to SBA, American Eagle Airlines, its affiliate, began flying Saab 340Bs and later Embraer ERJ-140s between SBA and LAX. American Eagle flew Canadair CRJ-700s between SBA and DFW until April 2009. The airline flew SBA–LAX until November 14, 2012, when SkyWest Airlines (American Eagle) took over with Canadair CRJ-200s. American Eagle suspended its flights to Los Angeles on March 31, 2014, ending American Airlines service at the airport. With the merger of US Airways and American, American Airlines returned to SBA with nonstop American Eagle regional jet service to Phoenix. In June 2016 American Eagle relaunched nonstop service to Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) on Mesa Airlines Canadair CRJ-900s. On April 4, 2017, American Airlines began a seasonal mainline Airbus A319 flight to DFW, the first mainline service since 2015, when Frontier Airlines left Santa Barbara. In September 2019, the DFW flights have been replaced with two daily Envoy Air E-175&#x27;s.

===Alaska===
Alaska-owned regional airline Horizon Air was the first Alaska Airlines affiliate to connect SBA with Seattle and Portland, flying Canadair CRJ-700s. From 2008 to 2010, Horizon also connected Santa Barbara non-stop to Sacramento and direct to Portland and/or Seattle. In 2011 SkyWest Airlines took over the Horizon Canadair CRJ-700 jets and later replaced them with Embraer E175s, replacing Horizon for all Alaska-branded flying into Santa Barbara and continues to operate flights via a capacity purchase agreement with Alaska Airlines. From June 15, 2017, to August 26, 2017, Horizon returned to Santa Barbara by taking over the Seattle route from SkyWest with its own Embraer E-175s. On August 27, 2017, Alaska Airlines began mainline service to Santa Barbara for the first time when it took over the Seattle route from Horizon with its own Boeing 737s. Currently Alaska Airlines serves Seattle twice daily with Embraer E-175s under Horizon. On March 18, 2021, Alaska added San Diego as its third destination from Santa Barbara. but it ended at the start of 2023

=== Sun Country ===
Sun Country Airlines was serving Santa Barbara twice weekly in 2018 between August and December to Minneapolis–St. Paul with Boeing 737s. Service began on August 16, 2018, and ended on December 9, 2018. On May 22, 2019, Sun Country resumed seasonal service with an increase to four times a week for the 2019 season. At the end of the 2019 season, Sun Country indicated that it did not plan to return.

=== Frontier ===
Frontier Airlines flew to Denver until 2015 with the Embraer 190 as well as Airbus A319 and Airbus A320 jets. After a multi-year hiatus, Frontier resumed service on August 21, 2018, with three times a week year-round service to Denver with the Airbus A320. In November 2019, they went seasonal and planned to return in 2020. However, due to COVID-19, no new date has been announced for the resumption of their service.

=== Contour ===
Contour Airlines began service on October 16, 2018. They flew daily to Oakland International Airport and ten times a week to Las Vegas McCarran International Airport with 30-seat Embraer 135 regional jets. Contour then announced an expansion of Santa Barbara as a focus city, and added a flight to Sacramento International Airport in April 2019. However, Contour then ended all service on March 31, 2020, and terminated all contracts with employees and the airport.

=== Delta ===
Delta Air Lines began three daily flights to Salt Lake City International Airport in August 2019, via Delta Connection partner SkyWest Airlines. The flights were operated with Embraer 175 aircraft. However, because of COVID-19, the airline then suspended service indefinitely on July 8, 2020. On September 15, 2023, it was announced Delta Air Lines would return to Santa Barbara with twice daily service to Salt Lake City and once-daily service to Atlanta in summer 2024 on A220-300 aircraft, it eventually started on June 7 2024.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) attributed the accident to spatial disorientation and the pilot&#x27;s decision to continue flying under visual flight rules into instrument meteorological conditions (continued VFR into IMC).
* July 23, 1985: A student pilot and a passenger in a Cessna 150L, &quot;N11490&quot;, were killed when the aircraft crashed on Runway 25 and was consumed by fire following a late-night takeoff. The accident was attributed to a failure to maintain airspeed, an inadvertent stall, and the pilot&#x27;s alcohol intoxication. The pilot also had not received any formal instruction in night flying, and his &quot;lack of recent experience in type operation&quot; and &quot;overconfidence in personal ability&quot; were cited by the NTSB as contributing factors.
* October 30, 1986: The two pilots of a Fairchild Swearingen SA-226TC Metroliner, &quot;N6099P&quot;, operated by Wings West Airlines on a scheduled commuter flight for American Eagle carrying 12 passengers, performed a gear-up landing after intentionally disabling the landing gear warning horn and subsequently neglecting to lower the landing gear. As the aircraft struck the runway, fragments of the starboard propeller punctured the passenger cabin, causing serious injuries to one passenger and minor injuries to another; an additional passenger suffered unspecified minor injuries. The NTSB attributed the accident to the crew&#x27;s failure to follow proper procedures, their disabling of the landing gear warning system, and the captain&#x27;s inadequate supervision of the first officer, who was flying the aircraft at the time.
* May 17, 1990: A Cessna 150H, &quot;N7156S&quot;, disappeared over the ocean during night touch-and-go landing practice. A pair of wheel chocks bearing the aircraft&#x27;s number were among the few items recovered; the pilot and passenger were presumed dead. The NTSB attributed the accident to &quot;[t]he pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain control of the airplane. Factors which contributed to the accident were the dark night and the pilot&#x27;s lack of night flying experience.&quot;
* October 21, 1990: A Cessna 172M, &quot;N13670&quot;, descended steeply and crashed while maneuvering in the airfield traffic pattern. The pilot and two passengers were seriously injured, the other passenger was killed, and the aircraft was destroyed. The NTSB attributed the accident to &quot;[t]he pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain proper glidepath while on final approach. A contributing factor was sunglare.&quot;
* June 28, 1991: The 4 occupants of a Mitsubishi MU-2B-36A, &quot;N2CJ&quot;, were killed when the aircraft crashed into the ocean in low visibility while maneuvering to maintain spacing from another aircraft that was on an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach. The NTSB attributed the accident to &quot;[t]he pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain directional control of the airplane after becoming spatially disoriented. Factors related to the accident were: darkness, low overcast cloud condition, the pilot&#x27;s decision to continue VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), which resulted in a near collision with another aircraft, his self induced pressure and diversion of attention, while coping with the situation that he had encountered.&quot;
* June 7, 1996: A Piper PA-32R-300, &quot;N4303X&quot;, crashed into the ocean during an ILS approach to Runway 7 in fog; the two pilots were killed. The NTSB attributed the accident to &quot;failure of the flying pilot to maintain control of the airplane, due to spatial disorientation, which resulted in an uncontrolled descent and collision with the water. Factors relating to the accident were: the lack of recent instrument experience by the flying pilot and the lack of monitoring (and/or remedial action) by the other pilot.&quot;
* November 20, 1996: A Beechcraft 95-B55 Baron, &quot;N210WW&quot;, crashed into rising terrain during an ILS approach to Runway 7 in low visibility; the pilot, who was the sole occupant, was killed. The pilot had not been responding properly to controllers&#x27; instructions and had failed his last instrument proficiency review. The NTSB attributed the accident to &quot;failure of the pilot to maintain control of the aircraft during an instrument approach, due to spatial disorientation, and/or his failure to maintain proper altitude. Factors relating to the accident were: the pilot&#x27;s delay (or failure) to initiate a missed approach, and his lack of instrument competency.&quot;
* December 6, 2016: An Airborne Windsports Edge XT-912-L, &quot;N188M&quot;, descended and crashed near the airport. The pilot, who was the sole occupant, was killed. The NTSB attributed the accident to &quot;[t]he pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain aircraft control while maneuvering in the traffic pattern.&quot;
*August 25, 2019: A private Lockheed C-130A, &quot; N119TG&quot;, was badly damaged in a runway excursion. After departing from Santa Maria Public Airport, passengers heard a &quot;loud bang,&quot; the cabin began to fill with smoke and misting hydraulic fluid, and the aircraft began having engine and hydraulic system problems. The pilots shut down the outer right-hand engine and made an emergency landing on Runway 7 at Santa Barbara, but they could not maintain directional control, prompting the captain to initiate a ground loop to avoid plowing into buildings and parked aircraft. The seven people on board were not injured, but airport lighting and signage were damaged, halting all flight operations for 19 hours. The NTSB attributed the accident to corrosion-related breakage of the number 3 bleed air duct, which blew hot air towards nearby wiring and hydraulic lines.
*January 29, 2025: A Cirrus SR22, &quot;N124LZ&quot;, crashed in a field north of the Storke Road-U.S. Route 101 interchange in Goleta after a CAPS parachute descent, critically injuring the two pilots. The Cirrus had departed from Santa Barbara Municipal Airport 25 minutes earlier and was believed to be returning to land. An intense fire destroyed the wreckage and started a small wildfire, but it was unclear whether the fire started before or after the crash. There were no passengers on board. The FAA and NTSB launched investigations.

==In popular culture==
In the 1951 war film &quot;Flying Leathernecks&quot;, John Wayne&#x27;s character was stationed in Goleta. The movie references the airbase as being in Goleta because, during World War II, the airbase had not yet been annexed by Santa Barbara. The movie has a short clip of the airport and surrounding area.

<doc id="377341" wikidata="Q477734" url="?curid=377341" title="Gizzard">
<text>The gizzard, also referred to as the ventriculus, gastric mill, and gigerium, is an organ found in the digestive tract of some animals, including archosaurs (birds and other dinosaurs, crocodiles, alligators, pterosaurs), earthworms, some gastropods, some fish, and some crustaceans. This specialized stomach constructed of thick muscular walls is used for grinding up food, often aided by particles of stone or grit. In certain insects and molluscs, the gizzard features chitinous plates or teeth.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;gizzard&quot; comes from the Middle English &quot;giser&quot;, which derives from a similar word in Old French &quot;gésier&quot;, which itself evolved from the Latin &quot;gigeria&quot;, meaning giblets.

==Structure==

===In birds===
Birds swallow food and store it in their crop if necessary. Then the food passes into their glandular stomach, also called the proventriculus, which is also sometimes referred to as the true stomach. This is the secretory part of the stomach. Then the food passes into the gizzard (also known as the &quot;muscular stomach&quot; or &quot;ventriculus&quot;). The gizzard can grind the food with previously swallowed grit and pass it back to the true stomach, and vice versa. In layman&#x27;s terms, the gizzard &#x27;chews&#x27; the food for the bird because it does not have teeth to chew food the way humans and other mammals do. 

By comparison, although in birds the stomach occurs in the digestive tract prior to the gizzard, in grasshoppers the gizzard occurs prior to the stomach, while in earthworms there is only a gizzard, and no stomach.

=== Koilin lining ===
In order to protect the muscles of the gizzard, the organ has a multi-layered membrane - or gastric cuticle - made of koilin, a carbohydrate-protein complex (and not keratin as once believed) to protect the muscles. The thickness of this membrane varies with the types of food the animal eats, with diets heavier in grains, seeds, and insects creating thicker membranes than those consisting of fruits, worms, meat, and other softer edibles. In some animals the membrane is slowly worn and replaced over time, while others will discard the worn lining in its entirety periodically.

The lining is critical to the proper functioning of the gizzard, but in some animals it can play an additional role as well. The male hornbill, for example, will fill its gizzard with fruit and then slough off the entire membrane to present it like a &#x27;bag of fruit&#x27; to its mate during the nesting season.

===Gizzard stones===
Some animals that lack teeth will swallow stones or grit to aid in fragmenting hard foods. All birds have gizzards, but not all will swallow stones or grit. Those that do employ the following method of chewing:

These stones are called &quot;gizzard stones&quot; or &quot;gastroliths&quot; and usually become round and smooth from the polishing action in the animal&#x27;s stomach. When too smooth to do their required work, they may be excreted or regurgitated.

==Animals with gizzards==

===Mammals===
Pangolins lack teeth and grind their food in a gizzard-like structure alongside pebbles.

===Birds and other archosaurs===
All birds have gizzards. The gizzards of emus, turkeys, chickens, and ducks are most notable in cuisine (see below). Crocodilians such as alligators and crocodiles also have gizzards.

Dinosaurs that are believed to have had gizzards based on the discovery of gizzard stones recovered near fossils include:

* &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot;
* &quot;Massospondylus&quot;
* &quot;Sellosaurus&quot;
* &quot;Omeisaurus&quot;
* &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;
* &quot;Barosaurus&quot;
* &quot;Dicraeosaurus&quot;
* &quot;Seismosaurus&quot;

The belief that &quot;Claosaurus&quot; had a gizzard has been discredited on the grounds that the fossil remains this claim was based on were another species and the stones merely from a stream.

At least some pterosaurs seemingly had gizzards. The most notable cases are &quot;Pterodaustro&quot; (inferred via gastroliths) and &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot; (directly preserved).

Carnivorous birds such as birds of prey as well as kiwis have membranuous gizzards as opposed to the sub-compressed gizzards of most birds.

Conversely, it is thought that some extinct birds like Enantiornithes did not have gizzards.

===Fish===
The mullet (Mugilidae) found in estuarine waters worldwide, and the gizzard or mud shad, found in freshwater lakes and streams from New York to Mexico, have gizzards.
The gillaroo (&quot;Salmo stomachius&quot;), a richly colored species of trout found in Lough Melvin, a lake in the north of Ireland, has a gizzard which is used to aid the digestion of water snails, the main component of its diet.

===Crustaceans===

Some crustaceans have a gizzard although this is usually referred to as a gastric mill.

===Earthworms===
Earthworms also have gizzards.

==In cuisine==
Poultry gizzards are a popular food throughout the world.

Grilled chicken gizzards are sold as street food in Haiti and throughout Southeast Asia. They are considered offal. 

Giblets consist of the heart, liver and gizzard of a bird, and are often eaten themselves or used as the basis for a soup or stock.

Gizzard and mashed potato is a popular dish in many European countries.

===Europe===
Stewed gizzards are eaten as a snack in Portugal, with a tomato based sauce.

In Spain, they are cooked on the plancha, and eaten while they are crispy on the outside.

In Hungary, it is made with paprika as &quot;zúza pörkölt&quot;.

In France, especially the Dordogne region, duck gizzards are eaten in the traditional Périgordian salad, along with walnuts, croutons and lettuce.

In Italy, gizzards are often used mixed with other offal.

In eastern Slavic countries, gizzards are the basis of many soups, such as rassolnik.

In Yiddish, gizzards are referred to as &quot;pupik&#x27;lech&quot; (also pipiklach, in its less normative form), literally meaning navels. The gizzards of kosher species of birds have a green or yellowish membrane lining the inside, which must be peeled off before cooking, as it lends a very bitter taste to the food. In traditional Eastern European Jewish cuisine, the gizzards, necks and feet of chickens were often cooked together, although not the liver, which per kosher law must be broiled. Kosher butchers often sell roasting chickens with the gizzard, neck and feet butchered and left in the cavity to be used for making chicken soup.

===Asia===
In Indonesia, gizzard and liver (&quot;ati ampela&quot;) are considered part of a complete fried poultry dish.

In Japan, gizzard is called &quot;zuri&quot; or &quot;sunagimo&quot;; usually it is cooked in yakitori (Japanese style skewered barbecue). In Kyushu (southern Japan), gizzard is fried into karaage.

In Korea, chicken gizzard, called &quot;dak-ttongjip&quot;, is stir-fried and eaten as anju or yasik. In some places, it is prepared raw and eaten mixed with garlic and onion.

In Taiwan, gizzards are often slow-cooked and served hot or cold in slices, with green onions and soy sauce. Skewered deep-fried gizzards without batter are also popular and served on the menu of many fried chicken stores.

In Mainland China, duck gizzard is a common snack, eaten alongside other duck parts such as feet, neck, heart, tongue, or head. Areas famous for their gizzard are Sichuan and Hubei provinces. Wuhan city in Hubei is famous for its brand of spicy gizzard, called &quot;jiujiuya&quot; (Simplified Chinese: 久久鸭). In Northern China, one can find barbecued duck gizzard.

The word &quot;sangdana&quot; is commonly used to refer to chicken gizzards in Northern India. The word is derived from Persian (sang = stone and dana = grain). Another name is &quot;pathri&quot;. It may be served cooked in a curry, while barbecued skewered gizzards are also popular.
In Kerala, vattum-karulum (literally translates to gizzard-liver curry) is a popular dish.

In Iran, some kebab restaurants mix chicken gizzards in their koobideh kebabs to increase the meat content. Gizzards are usually cooked at the same time along with chicken, packets of gizzards are also sold separately.

In Nepal, gizzard is called &quot;jaatey&quot; or &quot;pangra&quot;. It is eaten most often with drinks.

In the Philippines, gizzard is called &quot;Balun Balunan&quot;. It is usually cooked as a street food in a skewered barbecue style, though some households treat it like an entree. The most common style is &quot;Adobo&quot;.

===Africa===
In Ghana and Togo, it is eaten boiled, fried or grilled. Grilled, skewered gizzards, with spices and optional green peppers and onions, are popular.

In Nigeria, gizzard is either grilled or fried and served with stew and fried plantain, known as gizdodo. Skewered gizzards are also popular. 

In Kenya, Uganda, Cameroon and Nigeria, the gizzard of a cooked chicken is traditionally set aside for the oldest or most respected male at the table.

In Uganda, gizzard and other giblets are now commonly sold separately in the frozen section of supermarkets.

===Americas===
Pickled turkey gizzards are a traditional food in some parts of the Midwestern United States. In Chicago, gizzard is battered, deep fried and served with french fries and sauce. The Chamber of Commerce in Potterville, Michigan has held a Gizzard Fest each June since 2000; a gizzard-eating contest is among the weekend&#x27;s events. In the Southern United States, the gizzard is typically served fried, sometimes eaten with hot sauce or honey mustard, or added to crawfish boil along with crawfish sauce, and it is also used in traditional New Orleans gumbo.

In Mexico, they are eaten with rice or with chicken soup. They are also served grilled and prepared scrambled with eggs, onions, garlic and salsa; and served with beans and tortillas for breakfast and other meals.

In Trinidad and Tobago, gizzards are curried and served with rice or roti bread; it can also be stewed.

<text>The white-throated needletail (Hirundapus caudacutus), also known as needle-tailed swift or spine-tailed swift, is a large swift in the genus &quot;Hirundapus&quot;. It is reputed to reach speeds of up to 170 km/h (105 mph) in horizontal flight, but this is unverified because the methods used to measure its speed have not been published.

They build their nests in rock crevices in cliffs or hollow trees. They do not like to sit on the ground and spend most of their time in the air. They feed on small, flying insects like beetles, flies, bees and moths.

The white-throated needletail is a migratory bird, breeding in Central Asia and southern Siberia, and wintering south in the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Australia. It is a rare vagrant in Western Europe and has been recorded as far west as Norway, Sweden and Great Britain. In June 2013, an individual was spotted in Great Britain for the first time in 22 years. It later flew into a wind turbine and died; its body was sent to a museum.

In June 2022, a bird was recovered on an expedition ship MV Ortelius near Fair Isle approx 70 miles off Duncansby Head, Caithness, Scotland and successfully released.

White-throated needletails are large swifts with a robust, barrel-like body. They measure about 20 cm and weigh between 110 and 120 grams. They are greyish-brown except for a white throat and a white patch, extending from the base of the tail to the flanks.

Needle-tailed swifts get their name from the spined end of their tail, which is not forked as it is in the typical swifts of the genus &quot;Apus&quot;.

The white-throated needletail was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name &quot;Hirundo caudacuta&quot;. Their current genus &quot;Hirundapus&quot; is constructed from the names of the swallow genus &quot;Hirundo&quot; and the swift genus &quot;Apus&quot;. The specific name &quot;caudacutus&quot; comes from the Latin words &quot;cauda&quot; meaning &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;acutus&quot; meaning &quot;pointed&quot;.

<doc id="377355" wikidata="Q1500254" url="?curid=377355" title="List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names">
<text>This list of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names is intended to help those unfamiliar with classical languages to understand and remember the scientific names of organisms. The binomial nomenclature used for animals and plants is largely derived from Latin and Greek words, as are some of the names used for higher taxa, such as orders and above. At the time when biologist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) published the books that are now accepted as the starting point of binomial nomenclature, Latin was used in Western Europe as the common language of science, and scientific names were in Latin or Greek: Linnaeus continued this practice.
While learning Latin is now less common, it is still used by classical scholars, and for certain purposes in botany, medicine and the Roman Catholic Church, and it can still be found in scientific names. It is helpful to be able to understand the source of scientific names. Although the Latin names do not always correspond to the current English common names, they are often related, and if their meanings are understood, they are easier to recall. The binomial name often reflects limited knowledge or hearsay about a species at the time it was named. For instance &quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;, the chimpanzee, and &quot;Troglodytes troglodytes&quot;, the wren, are not necessarily cave-dwellers.
Sometimes a genus name or specific descriptor is simply the Latin or Greek name for the animal (e.g. &quot;Canis&quot; is Latin for dog). These words may not be included in the table below if they only occur for one or two taxa. Instead, the words listed below are the common adjectives and other modifiers that repeatedly occur in the scientific names of many organisms (in more than one genus).
Adjectives vary according to gender, and in most cases only the lemma form (nominative singular masculine form) is listed here. 1st-and-2nd-declension adjectives end in &quot;-us&quot; (masculine), &quot;-a&quot; (feminine) and &quot;-um&quot; (neuter), whereas 3rd-declension adjectives ending in &quot;-is&quot; (masculine and feminine) change to &quot;-e&quot; (neuter). For example, &quot;verus&quot; is listed without the variants for &quot;Aloe vera&quot; or &quot;Galium verum&quot;.

The second part of a binomial is often a person&#x27;s name in the genitive case, ending &quot;-i&quot; (masculine) or &quot;-ae&quot; (feminine), such as Kaempfer&#x27;s tody-tyrant, &quot;Hemitriccus kaempferi&quot;. The name may be converted into a Latinised form first, giving &quot;-ii&quot; and &quot;-iae&quot; instead.

Words that are very similar to their English forms have been omitted.
Some of the Greek transliterations given are Ancient Greek, and others are Modern Greek.
In the tables, L = Latin, G = Greek, and LG = similar in both languages.

<text>The history of [[ancient Egypt]] spans the period from the early prehistoric settlements of the northern Nile valley to the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. The pharaonic period, the period in which Egypt was ruled by a pharaoh, is dated from the 32nd century BC, when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified, until the country fell under Macedonian rule in 332 BC.

==Chronology==

;Note: For alternative &#x27;revisions&#x27; to the chronology of Egypt, see Egyptian chronology.
Egypt&#x27;s history is split into several different periods according to the ruling dynasty of each pharaoh. The dating of events is still a subject of research. The conservative dates are not supported by any reliable absolute date for a span of about three millennia. The following is the list according to conventional Egyptian chronology.

* Prehistoric Egypt (prior to 3100 BC)
* Naqada III (&quot;the protodynastic period&quot;, approximately 3100–3000 BC; sometimes referred to as &quot;Dynasty 0&quot;)
* Early Dynastic Period (First–Second Dynasties)
* Old Kingdom (Third–Sixth Dynasties)
* First Intermediate Period (Seventh or Eighth–Eleventh Dynasties)
* Middle Kingdom (Twelfth–Thirteenth Dynasties)
* Second Intermediate Period (Fourteenth–Seventeenth Dynasties)
* New Kingdom (Eighteenth–Twentieth Dynasties)
* Third Intermediate Period (also known as the Libyan Period; Twenty-first–Twenty-fifth Dynasties)
* Late Period (Twenty-sixth–Thirty-first Dynasties)
* Ptolemaic Egypt (305–30 BC)

==Neolithic Egypt==
===Neolithic period===
The Nile has been the lifeline for Egyptian culture since nomadic hunter-gatherers began living along it during the Pleistocene. Traces of these early people appear in the form of artefacts and rock carvings along the terraces of the Nile and in the oases.

Along the Nile in the 12th millennium BC, an Upper Paleolithic grain-grinding culture using the earliest type of sickle blades had replaced the culture of hunting, fishing, and hunter-gatherers using stone tools. Despite evidence indicating human habitation and cattle herding in the southwestern corner of Egypt near the Sudan border before the 8th millennium BC, the idea of an independent bovine domestication event in Africa must be abandoned because subsequent evidence gathered over a period of thirty years has failed to corroborate this.

Archaeological evidence has attested that population settlements occurred in Nubia as early as the Late Pleistocene era and from the 5th millennium BC onwards, whereas there is &quot;no or scanty evidence&quot; of human presence in the Egyptian Nile Valley during these periods, which may be due to problems in site preservation.

The oldest-known domesticated cattle remains in Africa are from the Faiyum c. 4400 BC. Geological evidence and computer climate modeling studies suggest that natural climate changes around the 8th millennium BC began to desiccate the extensive pastoral lands of North Africa, eventually forming the Sahara by the 25th century BC.

Continued desiccation forced the early ancestors of the Egyptians to settle around the Nile more permanently and forced them to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle. However, the period from 9th to the 6th millennium BC has left very little in the way of archaeological evidence.

===Prehistoric Egypt===
 
The Nile valley of Egypt was basically uninhabitable until the work of clearing and irrigating the land along the banks was started. However, it appears that this clearance and irrigation was largely under way by the 6th millennium. By that time, Nile society was already engaged in organized agriculture and the construction of large buildings.

At this time, Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were herding cattle and also constructing large buildings. Mortar was in use by the 4th millennium. The people of the valley and the Nile Delta were self-sufficient and were raising barley and emmer, an early variety of wheat, and stored it in pits lined with reed mats. They raised cattle, goats and pigs and they wove linen and baskets. Prehistory continues through this time, variously held to begin with the Amratian culture.

Between 5500 BC and the 31st century BC, small settlements flourished along the Nile, whose delta empties into the Mediterranean Sea.

The Tasian culture was the next to appear; it existed in Upper Egypt starting about 4500 BC. This group is named for the burials found at Deir Tasa, a site on the east bank of the Nile between Asyut and Akhmim. The Tasian culture is notable for producing the earliest blacktop-ware, a type of red and brown pottery painted black on its top and interior.

The Badari culture, named for the Badari site near Deir Tasa, followed the Tasian; however, similarities cause many to avoid differentiating between them at all. The Badari culture continued to produce the kind of pottery called blacktop-ware (although its quality was much improved over previous specimens), and was assigned the sequence dating numbers between 21 and 29. The significant difference, however, between the Tasian and Badari, which prevents scholars from completely merging the two, is that Badari sites are Chalcolithic while the Tasian sites remained Neolithic and are thus considered technically part of the Stone Age.

The Amratian culture is named after the site of El-Amrah, about south of Badari. El-Amreh was the first site where this culture was found unmingled with the later Gerzeh culture. However, this period is better attested at Nagada, and so is also referred to as the &quot;Naqada I&quot; culture. Black-topped ware continued to be produced, but white cross-line ware, a type of pottery decorated with close parallel white lines crossed by another set of close parallel white lines, began to be produced during this time. The Amratian period falls between S.D. 30 and 39. Newly excavated objects indicate that trade between Upper and Lower Egypt existed at this time. A stone vase from the north was found at el-Amreh, and copper, which is not present in Egypt, was apparently imported from the Sinai Peninsula or perhaps Nubia. Obsidian and an extremely small amount of gold were both definitively imported from Nubia during this time. Trade with the oases was also likely.

====Naqada II====
The Gerzeh culture (&quot;Naqada II&quot;), named after the site of el-Gerzeh, was the next stage in cultural development, and it was during this time that the foundation for ancient Egypt was laid. The Gerzeh culture was largely an unbroken development out of the Amratian, starting in the Nile Delta and moving south through Upper Egypt; however, it failed to dislodge the Amratian in Nubia. The Gerzeh culture coincided with a significant drop in rainfall and farming produced the vast majority of food. With increased food supplies, the populace adopted a much more sedentary lifestyle, and the larger settlements grew to cities of about 5000 residents. It was in this time that the city dwellers started using adobe to build their cities. Copper instead of stone was increasingly used to make tools and weaponry. Silver, gold, lapis lazuli (imported from Badakhshan in what is now Afghanistan), and Egyptian faience were used ornamentally, and the cosmetic palettes used for eye paint since the Badari culture began to be adorned with reliefs.

By the 33rd century BC, just before the First Dynasty of Egypt, Egypt was divided into two kingdoms known from later times as Upper Egypt to the south and Lower Egypt to the north. The dividing line was drawn roughly in the area of modern Cairo.

==Dynastic Egypt==
===Early dynastic period===

The historical records of ancient Egypt begin with Egypt as a unified state, which occurred sometime around 3150 BC. According to Egyptian tradition, Menes, thought to have unified Upper and Lower Egypt, was the first king. This Egyptian culture, customs, art expression, architecture, and social structure were closely tied to religion, remarkably stable, and changed little over a period of nearly 3000 years.

Egyptian chronology, which involves regnal years, began around this time. The conventional chronology was accepted during the twentieth century, but it does not include any of the major revision proposals that also have been made in that time. Even within a single work, archaeologists often offer several possible dates, or even several whole chronologies as possibilities. Consequently, there may be discrepancies between dates shown here and in articles on particular rulers or topics related to ancient Egypt. There also are several possible spellings of the names. Typically, Egyptologists divide the history of pharaonic civilization using a schedule laid out first by Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, which was written during the Ptolemaic Kingdom in the third century BC.

Prior to the unification of Egypt, the land was settled with autonomous villages. With the early dynasties, and for much of Egypt&#x27;s history thereafter, the country came to be known as the Two Lands. The pharaohs established a national administration and appointed royal governors.

According to Manetho, the first pharaoh was Menes, but archeological findings support the view that the first ruler to claim to have united the two lands was Narmer, the final king of the Naqada III period. His name is known primarily from the famous Narmer Palette, whose scenes have been interpreted as the act of uniting Upper and Lower Egypt. Menes is now thought to be one of the titles of Hor-Aha, the second pharaoh of the First Dynasty.

Funeral practices for the elite resulted in the construction of mastabas, which later became models for subsequent Old Kingdom constructions such as the step pyramid, thought to have originated during the Third Dynasty of Egypt.

===Old Kingdom===

The Old Kingdom is most commonly regarded as spanning the period of time when Egypt was ruled by the Third Dynasty through to the Sixth Dynasty (2686–2181 BCE). The royal capital of Egypt during this period was located at Memphis, where Djoser (2630–2611 BCE) established his court.

The Old Kingdom is perhaps best known, however, for the large number of pyramids, which were constructed at this time as pharaonic burial places. For this reason, this epoch is frequently referred to as &quot;the Age of the Pyramids&quot;. The first notable pharaoh of the Old Kingdom was Djoser of the Third Dynasty, who ordered the construction of the first pyramid, the Pyramid of Djoser, in Memphis&#x27; necropolis of Saqqara.

It was in this era that formerly independent states became nomes (districts) ruled solely by the pharaoh. Former local rulers were forced to assume the role of nomarch (governor) or work as tax collectors. Egyptians in this era worshiped the pharaoh as a god, believing that he ensured the annual flooding of the Nile that was necessary for their crops.

The Old Kingdom and its royal power reached their zenith under the Fourth Dynasty. Sneferu, the dynasty&#x27;s founder, is believed to have commissioned at least three pyramids; while his son and successor Khufu (Greek &quot;Cheops&quot;) erected the Great Pyramid of Giza, Sneferu had more stone and brick moved than any other pharaoh. Khufu, his son Khafre (Greek &quot;Chephren&quot;), and his grandson Menkaure (Greek &quot;Mycerinus&quot;) all achieved lasting fame in the construction of the Giza pyramid complex.

To organize and feed the manpower needed to create these pyramids required a centralized government with extensive powers, and Egyptologists believe the Old Kingdom at this time demonstrated this level of sophistication. Recent excavations near the pyramids led by Mark Lehner have uncovered a large city that seems to have housed, fed and supplied the pyramid workers. Although it was once believed that slaves built these monuments, a theory based on The Exodus narrative of the Hebrew Bible, study of the tombs of the workmen, who oversaw construction on the pyramids, has shown they were built by a corvée of peasants drawn from across Egypt. They apparently worked while the annual flood covered their fields, as well as a very large crew of specialists, including stonecutters, painters, mathematicians and priests.

The Fifth Dynasty began with Userkaf c. 2495 BC and was marked by the growing importance of the cult of the sun god Ra. Consequently, less effort was devoted to the construction of pyramid complexes than during the Fourth Dynasty and more to the construction of sun temples in Abusir. The decoration of pyramid complexes grew more elaborate during the dynasty and its last king, Unas, was the first to have the Pyramid Texts inscribed in his pyramid.

Egypt&#x27;s expanding interests in trade goods such as ebony, incense such as myrrh and frankincense, gold, copper and other useful metals compelled the ancient Egyptians to navigate the open seas. Evidence from the pyramid of Sahure, second king of the dynasty, shows that a regular trade existed with the Syrian coast to procure cedar wood. Pharaohs also launched expeditions to the famed Land of Punt, possibly the Horn of Africa, for ebony, ivory and aromatic resins.

During the Sixth Dynasty (2345–2181 BCE), the power of pharaohs gradually weakened in favor of powerful nomarchs. These no longer belonged to the royal family and their charge became hereditary, thus creating local dynasties largely independent from the central authority of the pharaoh. Internal disorders set in during the incredibly long reign of Pepi II Neferkare (2278–2184 BCE) towards the end of the dynasty. His death, certainly well past that of his intended heirs, might have created succession struggles and the country slipped into civil wars mere decades after the close of Pepi II&#x27;s reign. The final blow came when the 4.2 kiloyear event struck the region in the 22nd century BC, producing consistently low Nile flood levels. The result was the collapse of the Old Kingdom followed by decades of famine and strife.

===First Intermediate Period===

After the fall of the Old Kingdom came a roughly 200-year stretch of time known as the First Intermediate Period, which is generally thought to include a relatively obscure set of pharaohs running from the end of the Sixth to the Tenth and most of the Eleventh Dynasties. Most of these were likely local monarchs who did not hold much power outside of their nome. There are a number of texts known as &quot;Lamentations&quot; from the early period of the subsequent Middle Kingdom that may shed some light on what happened during this period. Some of these texts reflect on the breakdown of rule, others allude to invasion by &quot;Asiatic bowmen&quot;. In general, the stories focus on a society where the natural order of things in both society and nature was overthrown.

It is also highly likely that it was during this period that all of the pyramid and tomb complexes were looted. Further lamentation texts allude to this fact, and by the beginning of the Middle Kingdom mummies are found decorated with magical spells that were once exclusive to the pyramid of the kings of the Sixth Dynasty.

By 2160 BC, a new line of pharaohs, the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties, consolidated Lower Egypt from their capital in Heracleopolis Magna. A rival line, the Eleventh Dynasty based at Thebes, reunited Upper Egypt, and a clash between the rival dynasties was inevitable. Around 2055 BC, the Theban forces defeated the Heracleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands. The reign of its first pharaoh, Mentuhotep II, marks the beginning of the Middle Kingdom.

===Middle Kingdom===


The Middle Kingdom is the period in the history of ancient Egypt stretching from the 39th regnal year of Mentuhotep II of the Eleventh Dynasty to the end of the Thirteenth Dynasty, roughly between 2030 and 1650 BC. The period comprises two phases, the Eleventh Dynasty, which ruled from Thebes, and then the Twelfth Dynasty, whose capital was Lisht. These two dynasties were originally considered the full extent of this unified kingdom, but some historians now consider the first part of the Thirteenth Dynasty to belong to the Middle Kingdom.

The earliest pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom traced their origin to two nomarchs of Thebes, Intef the Elder, who served a Heracleopolitan pharaoh of the Tenth Dynasty, and his successor, Mentuhotep I. The successor of the latter, Intef I, was the first Theban nomarch to claim a Horus name and thus the throne of Egypt. He is considered the first pharaoh of the Eleventh Dynasty. His claims brought the Thebans into conflict with the rulers of the Tenth Dynasty. Intef I and his brother Intef II undertook several campaigns northwards and finally captured the important nome of Abydos. Warfare continued intermittently between the Thebean and Heracleapolitan dynasties until the 39th regnal year of Mentuhotep II, second successor of Intef II. At this point, the Herakleopolitans were defeated and the Theban dynasty consolidated their rule over Egypt. Mentuhotep II is known to have commanded military campaigns south into Nubia, which had gained its independence during the First Intermediate Period. There is also evidence for military actions against the Southern Levant. The king reorganized the country and placed a vizier at the head of civil administration for the country. Mentuhotep II was succeeded by his son, Mentuhotep III, who organized an expedition to Punt. His reign saw the realization of some of the finest Egyptian carvings. Mentuhotep III was succeeded by Mentuhotep IV, the final pharaoh of this dynasty. Despite being absent from various lists of pharaohs, his reign is attested from a few inscriptions in Wadi Hammamat that record expeditions to the Red Sea coast and to quarry stone for the royal monuments.

The leader of this expedition was his vizier Amenemhat, who is widely assumed to be the future Pharaoh Amenemhat I, the first pharaoh of the Twelfth Dynasty. Amenemhat is therefore assumed by some Egyptologists to have either usurped the throne or assumed power after Mentuhotep IV died childless. Amenemhat I built a new capital for Egypt, Itjtawy, thought to be located near the present-day Lisht, although Manetho claims the capital remained at Thebes. Amenemhat forcibly pacified internal unrest, curtailed the rights of the nomarchs, and is known to have launched at least one campaign into Nubia. His son Senusret I continued the policy of his father to recapture Nubia and other territories lost during the First Intermediate Period. The Libu were subdued under his forty-five year reign and Egypt&#x27;s prosperity and security were secured. Senusret III (1878–1839 BC) was a warrior king, leading his troops deep into Nubia, and built a series of massive forts throughout the country to establish Egypt&#x27;s formal boundaries with the unconquered areas of its territory. Amenemhat III (1860–1815 BC) is considered the last great pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom.

Egypt&#x27;s population began to exceed food production levels during the reign of Amenemhat III, who then ordered the exploitation of the Faiyum and increased mining operations in the Sinai Peninsula. He also invited settlers from Western Asia to Egypt to labor on Egypt&#x27;s monuments. Late in his reign, the annual flooding of the Nile began to fail, further straining the resources of the government. The Thirteenth Dynasty and Fourteenth Dynasty witnessed the slow decline of Egypt into the Second Intermediate Period, in which some of the settlers invited by Amenemhat III would seize power as the Hyksos.

===Second Intermediate Period and the Hyksos===

The Second Intermediate Period marks a period when Egypt once again fell into disarray between the end of the Middle Kingdom and the start of the New Kingdom. This period is best known as the time the Hyksos made their appearance in Egypt, the reigns of its kings comprising the Fifteenth Dynasty.

The Thirteenth Dynasty proved unable to hold onto the long land of Egypt, and a provincial family of Levantine descent located in the marshes of the eastern Delta at Avaris broke away from the central authority to form the Fourteenth Dynasty. The splintering of the land most likely happened shortly after the reigns of the powerful Thirteenth Dynasty Pharaohs Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV c. 1720 BC.

While the Fourteenth Dynasty was Levantine, the Hyksos first appeared in Egypt c. 1650 BC when they took control of Avaris and rapidly moved south to Memphis, thereby ending the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasties. The outlines of the traditional account of the &quot;invasion&quot; of the land by the Hyksos is preserved in the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; of Manetho, who records that during this time the Hyksos overran Egypt, led by Salitis, the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty. More recently, however, the idea of a simple migration, with little or no violence involved, has gained some support. Under this theory, the Egyptian rulers of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties were unable to stop these new migrants from traveling to Egypt from the Levant because their kingdoms were struggling to cope with various domestic problems, including possibly famine and plague. Be it military or peaceful, the weakened state of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasty kingdoms could explain why they rapidly fell to the emerging Hyksos power.

The Hyksos princes and chieftains ruled in the eastern Delta with their local Egyptian vassals. The Fifteenth Dynasty rulers established their capital and seat of government at Memphis and their summer residence at Avaris. The Hyksos kingdom was centered in the eastern Nile Delta and central Egypt but relentlessly pushed south for the control of central and Upper Egypt. Around the time Memphis fell to the Hyksos, the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes declared its independence and set itself up as the Sixteenth Dynasty. Another short lived dynasty might have done the same in central Egypt, profiting from the power vacuum created by the fall of the Thirteenth Dynasty and forming the Abydos Dynasty. By 1600 BC, the Hyksos had successfully moved south in central Egypt, eliminating the Abydos Dynasty and directly threatening the Sixteenth Dynasty. The latter was to prove unable to resist and Thebes fell to the Hyksos for a very short period c. 1580 BC. The Hyksos rapidly withdrew to the north and Thebes regained some independence under the Seventeenth Dynasty. From then on, Hyksos relations with the south seem to have been mainly of a commercial nature, although Theban princes appear to have recognized the Hyksos rulers and may possibly have provided them with tribute for a period.

The Seventeenth Dynasty was to prove the salvation of Egypt and would eventually lead the war of liberation that drove the Hyksos back into Asia. The two last kings of this dynasty were Seqenenre Tao and Kamose. Ahmose I completed the conquest and expulsion of the Hyksos from the Nile Delta, restored Theban rule over the whole of Egypt and successfully reasserted Egyptian power in its formerly subject territories of Nubia and the Southern Levant. His reign marks the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty and the New Kingdom.

===New Kingdom===

Possibly as a result of the foreign rule of the Hyksos during the Second Intermediate Period, the New Kingdom saw Egypt attempt to create a buffer between the Levant and Egypt, and attain its greatest territorial extent. It expanded far south into Nubia and held wide territories in the Near East. Egyptian armies fought Hittite armies for control of modern-day Syria.

====Eighteenth Dynasty====
This was a time of great wealth and power for Egypt. Some of the most important and best-known pharaohs ruled at this time, such as Hatshepsut. Hatshepsut is unusual as she was a female pharaoh, a rare occurrence in Egyptian history. She was an ambitious and competent leader, extending Egyptian trade south into present-day Somalia and north into the Mediterranean. She ruled for twenty years through a combination of widespread propaganda and deft political skill. Her co-regent and successor Thutmose III (&quot;the Napoleon of Egypt&quot;) expanded Egypt&#x27;s army and wielded it with great success. However, late in his reign, he ordered her name hacked out from her monuments. He fought against Asiatic people and was the most successful of Egyptian pharaohs. Amenhotep III built extensively at the temple of Karnak including the Luxor Temple, which consisted of two pylons, a colonnade behind the new temple entrance, and a new temple to the goddess Maat.

During the reign of Thutmose III (c. 1479–1425 BC), pharaoh, originally referring to the king&#x27;s palace, became a form of address for the person who was king.

One of the best-known 18th Dynasty pharaohs is Amenhotep IV, who changed his name to Akhenaten in honor of the god Aten. His exclusive worship of the Aten, sometimes called Atenism, is often seen as history&#x27;s first instance of monotheism. Atenism and several changes that accompanied it seriously disrupted Egyptian society. Akhenaten built a new capital at the site of Amarna, which gives his reign and the few that followed their modern name, the Amarna Period. Amarna art diverged significantly from the previous conventions of Egyptian art. Under a series of successors, of whom the longest reigning were Tutankhamun and Horemheb, worship of the old gods was revived and much of the art and monuments that were created during Akhenaten&#x27;s reign was defaced or destroyed. When Horemheb died without an heir, he named as his successor Ramesses I, founder of the Nineteenth Dynasty.

====Nineteenth Dynasty====

Ramesses I reigned for two years and was succeeded by his son Seti I. Seti I carried on the work of Horemheb in restoring power, control, and respect to Egypt. He also was responsible for creating the temple complex at Abydos.

Arguably Ancient Egypt&#x27;s power as a nation-state peaked during the reign of Ramesses II (&quot;the Great&quot;) of the Nineteenth Dynasty. He reigned for 67 years from the age of 18 and carried on his father Seti I&#x27;s work and created many more splendid temples, such as that of Abu Simbel temples on the Nubian border. He sought to recover territories in the Levant that had been held by the Eighteenth Dynasty. His campaigns of reconquest culminated in the Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC, where he led Egyptian armies against those of the Hittite king Muwatalli II and was caught in history&#x27;s first recorded military ambush.

Ramesses II was famed for the huge number of children he sired by his various wives and concubines; the tomb he built for his sons (many of whom he outlived) in the Valley of the Kings has proven to be the largest funerary complex in Egypt.

His immediate successors continued the military campaigns, though an increasingly troubled court complicated matters. Ramesses II was succeeded by his son Merneptah and then by Merenptah&#x27;s son Seti II. Seti II&#x27;s throne seems to have been disputed by his half-brother Amenmesse, who may have temporarily ruled from Thebes.

Upon his death, Seti II&#x27;s son Siptah, who may have been afflicted with poliomyelitis during his life, was appointed to the throne by Chancellor Bay, a West Asian commoner who served as vizier behind the scenes. At Siptah&#x27;s early death, the throne was assumed by Twosret, the queen dowager of Seti II and possibly Amenmesse&#x27;s sister.

A period of anarchy at the end of Twosret&#x27;s short reign saw a native reaction to foreign control leading to the execution of Bay and the enthronement of Setnakhte, establishing the Twentieth Dynasty.

====Twentieth Dynasty====
The last &quot;great&quot; pharaoh from the New Kingdom is widely considered Ramesses III, the son of Setnakhte who reigned three decades after the time of Ramesses II (c.1279–1213 BC). In Year 8 of his reign, the Sea People invaded Egypt by land and sea. Ramesses III defeated them in two great land and sea battles. He claimed that he incorporated them as subject people and settled them in Southern Canaan, although there is evidence that they forced their way into Canaan. Their presence in Canaan may have contributed to the formation of new states in this region such as Philistia after the collapse of the Egyptian Empire. He was also compelled to fight invading Libyan tribesmen in two major campaigns in Egypt&#x27;s Western Delta in his Year 6 and Year 11 respectively.

The heavy cost of these battles slowly exhausted Egypt&#x27;s treasury and contributed to the gradual decline of the Egyptian Empire in Asia. The severity of these difficulties is stressed by the fact that the first known strike action in recorded history occurred during Year 29 of Ramesses III&#x27;s reign, when the food rations for the Egypt&#x27;s favoured and elite royal tomb-builders and artisans in the village of Deir el-Medina could not be provisioned. Something in the air prevented much sunlight from reaching the ground and also arrested global tree growth for almost two full decades until 1140 BC. One proposed cause is the Hekla 3 eruption in Iceland, but the dating of that event remains in dispute.

Following Ramesses III&#x27;s death, there was endless bickering between his heirs. Three of his sons would go on to assume power as Ramesses IV, Ramesses VI and Ramesses VIII, respectively. However, at this time Egypt was also increasingly beset by a series of droughts, below-normal flooding levels of the Nile, famine, civil unrest and official corruption. The power of the last pharaoh, Ramesses XI, grew so weak that in the south the Theban High Priests of Amun became the effective de facto rulers of Upper Egypt, while Smendes controlled Lower Egypt even before Ramesses XI&#x27;s death. Smendes would eventually found the Twenty-first Dynasty at Tanis.

===Third Intermediate Period===
After the death of Ramesses XI, his successor Smendes ruled from the city of Tanis in the north, while the High Priests of Amun at Thebes had effective rule of the south of the country, whilst still nominally recognizing Smendes as king. In fact, this division was less significant than it seems, since both priests and pharaohs came from the same family. Piankh, assumed control of Upper Egypt, ruling from Thebes, with the northern limit of his control ending at Al-Hibah. (The High Priest Herihor had died before Ramesses XI, but also was an all-but-independent ruler in the latter days of the king&#x27;s reign.) The country was once again split into two parts with the priests in Thebes and the pharaohs at Tanis. Their reign seems without other distinction, and they were replaced without any apparent struggle by the Libyan kings of the Twenty-Second Dynasty.

Egypt has long had ties with Libya, and the first king of the new dynasty, Shoshenq I, was a Meshwesh Libyan, who served as the commander of the armies under the last ruler of the Twenty-First Dynasty, Psusennes II. He unified the country, putting control of the Amun clergy under his own son as the High Priest of Amun, a post that was previously a hereditary appointment. The scant and patchy nature of the written records from this period suggest that it was unsettled. There appear to have been many subversive groups, which eventually led to the creation of the Twenty-Third Dynasty, which ran concurrent with the latter part of the Twenty-Second Dynasty. 
The country was reunited by the Twenty-Second Dynasty founded by Shoshenq I in 945 BC (or 943 BC), who descended from Meshwesh immigrants, originally from Ancient Libya. This brought stability to the country for well over a century. After the reign of Osorkon II the country had again splintered into two states with Shoshenq III of the Twenty-Second Dynasty controlling Lower Egypt by 818 BC while Takelot II and his son (the future Osorkon III) ruled Middle and Upper Egypt.
After the withdrawal of Egypt from Nubia at the end of the New Kingdom, a native dynasty took control of Nubia. Under king Piye, the Nubian founder of Twenty-Fifth Dynasty, the Nubians pushed north in an effort to crush his Libyan opponents ruling in the Delta. Piye managed to attain power as far as Memphis. His opponent Tefnakhte ultimately submitted to him, but he was allowed to remain in power in Lower Egypt and founded the short-lived Twenty-Fourth Dynasty at Sais. The Kushite kingdom to the south took full advantage of this division and political instability and defeated the combined might of several native-Egyptian rulers such as Peftjauawybast, Osorkon IV of Tanis, and Tefnakht of Sais. Piye was succeeded first by his brother, Shabaka, and then by his two sons Shebitku and Taharqa. Taharqa reunited the Two Lands of Northern and Southern Egypt and created an empire that was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom. Pharaohs such as Taharqa built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including at Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, and Jebel Barkal. It was during the 25th Dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in modern Sudan) since the Middle Kingdom.

The international prestige of Egypt declined considerably by this time. The country&#x27;s international allies had fallen under the sphere of influence of Assyria and from about 700 BC the question became when, not if, there would be war between the two states. Taharqa&#x27;s reign and that of his successor, Tantamani, were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians against whom there were numerous victories, but ultimately Thebes was occupied and Memphis sacked.

===Late Period===

From 671 BC on, Memphis and the Delta region became the target of many attacks from the Assyrians, who expelled the Nubians and handed over power to client kings of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty. Psamtik I was the first recognized as the king of the whole of Egypt, and he brought increased stability to the country during a 54-year reign from the new capital of Sais. Four successive Saite kings continued guiding Egypt successfully and peacefully from 610 to 526 BC, keeping the Babylonians in certain measures away with the help of Greek mercenaries.

However, during this period Babylonian emperor Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC) campaigned against the Egyptians and drove them back over the Sinai. In 567 BC he went to war with Pharaoh Amasis, and briefly invaded Egypt itself.

By the end of this period a new power was growing in the Near East: Persia. The Pharaoh Psamtik III had to face the might of Persia at Pelusium; he was defeated and briefly escaped to Memphis, but ultimately was captured and then executed.

===Persian domination===

Achaemenid Egypt can be divided into two eras: the first period of Persian occupation, 525–404 BC (when Egypt became a satrapy), followed by an interval of independence, and the second and final period of occupation, 343–332 BC.

The Persian king Cambyses assumed the formal title of Pharaoh, called himself Mesuti-Re (&quot;Re has given birth&quot;), and sacrificed to the Egyptian gods. He founded the Twenty-seventh Dynasty. Egypt was then joined with Cyprus and Phoenicia in the sixth satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire.

Cambyses&#x27; successors Darius I the Great and Xerxes pursued a similar policy, visited the country, and warded off an Athenian attack. It is likely that Artaxerxes I and Darius II visited the country as well, although it is not attested, and did not prevent the Egyptians from feeling unhappy.

During the war of succession after the reign of Darius II, which broke out in 404 BC, the Egyptians revolted under Amyrtaeus and regained their independence. This sole ruler of the Twenty-eighth Dynasty died in 399, and power went to the Twenty-ninth Dynasty. The Thirtieth Dynasty was established in 380 BC and lasted until 343 BC. Nectanebo II was the last native king to rule Egypt.

Artaxerxes III (358–338 BC) reconquered Egypt for a brief period (343–332 BC).
In 332 BC, Alexander the Great conquered the Nile valley. The Achaemenid rule had ended, and for a while Egypt was a satrapy in Alexander&#x27;s empire. Later the Ptolemies and then the Romans successively ruled Egypt.

===Ptolemaic dynasty===

In 332 BC, Alexander III of Macedon conquered Egypt with little resistance from the Persians. He visited Memphis, and went on a pilgrimage to the oracle of Amun at the Siwa Oasis. The oracle declared him the son of Amun. He conciliated the Egyptians by the respect he showed for their religion, but he appointed Greeks to virtually all the senior posts in the country, and founded a new Greek city, Alexandria, to be the new capital. The wealth of Egypt could now be harnessed for Alexander&#x27;s conquest of the rest of the Persian Empire. Early in 331 BC, he led his forces away to Phoenicia, never returning to Egypt.

Following Alexander&#x27;s death in Babylon in 323 BC, a succession crisis erupted among his generals. Perdiccas ruled the empire as regent for Alexander&#x27;s half-brother Arrhidaeus, who became Philip III of Macedon, and Alexander&#x27;s infant son Alexander IV of Macedon. Perdiccas appointed Ptolemy, one of Alexander&#x27;s closest companions, to rule Egypt in the name of the joint kings. However, as Alexander&#x27;s empire disintegrated, Ptolemy soon established himself as ruler in his own right. Ptolemy successfully defended Egypt against an invasion by Perdiccas in 321 BC and consolidated his position in Egypt and the surrounding areas during the Wars of the Diadochi (322–301 BC). In 305 BC, Ptolemy took the title of Pharaoh. As Ptolemy I Soter (&quot;Saviour&quot;), he founded the Ptolemaic dynasty that was to rule Egypt for nearly 300 years.

The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions by marrying their siblings, had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life. Hellenistic culture thrived in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest. The Egyptians soon accepted the Ptolemies as the successors to the pharaohs of independent Egypt. Ptolemy&#x27;s family ruled Egypt until the Roman conquest of 30 BC.

All the male rulers of the dynasty took the name, Ptolemy. Ptolemaic queens regnant, some of whom were the sisters of their husbands, were usually called Cleopatra, Arsinoe or Berenice. The most famous member of the line was the last queen, Cleopatra VII, known for her role in the Roman political battles between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and later between Octavian and Mark Antony. Her apparent suicide at the conquest by Rome marked the end of Ptolemaic rule in Egypt.

<doc id="377370" wikidata="Q2477361" url="?curid=377370" title="History of modern Egypt">
<text>According to most scholars the history of modern [[Egypt]] dates from the start of the rule of Muhammad Ali in 1805 and his launching of Egypt&#x27;s modernization project that involved building a new army and suggesting a new map for the country, though the definition of Egypt&#x27;s modern history has varied in accordance with different definitions of modernity. Some scholars date it as far back as 1516 with the Ottomans&#x27; defeat of the Mamlūks in 1516–17.

Muhammad Ali&#x27;s dynasty became practically independent from Ottoman rule, following his military campaigns against the Empire and his ability to enlist large-scale armies, allowing him to control both Egypt and parts of North Africa and the Middle East. In 1882, the Khedivate of Egypt became part of the British sphere of influence in the region, a situation that conflicted with its position as an autonomous vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. 
The country became a British protectorate in 1915 and achieved full independence in 1922, becoming a kingdom under the rule of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s dynasty, which lasted until 1952.

Gamal Abdel Nasser ended monarchical rule and established a republic in Egypt, known as the Republic of Egypt, following the 1952 Egyptian revolution. Egypt was ruled autocratically by three presidents over the following six decades: by Nasser from 1954 until his death in 1970, by Anwar Sadat from 1971 until his assassination in 1981, and by Hosni Mubarak from 1981 until his resignation in the face of the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

In 2012, after more than a year under the interim government of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, with Field Marshal Tantawi as its chairman, elections were held and the Islamist Mohamed Morsi became the first democratically elected head of state in the entire history of Egypt. In 2013, after millions of Egyptians in huge rallies and demonstrations demanding Morsi&#x27;s resignation, the army announced the ousting of Morsi and preparations for a new election. Resulting in the election of Abdel Fattah El-Sisi

==Khedivate of Egypt==
==British administration==

In 1882 opposition to European control led to growing tension amongst notable Egyptians, the most dangerous opposition coming from the army. A large military demonstration in September 1881 forced the Khedive Tewfiq to dismiss his prime minister. In April 1882, France and the United Kingdom sent warships to Alexandria to bolster the Khedive amidst a turbulent climate, spreading fear of invasion throughout the country.

Tawfiq moved to Alexandria for fear of his own safety as army officers led by Ahmed Urabi began to take control of the government. By June Egypt was in the hands of nationalists opposed to European domination of the country. The naval bombardment of Alexandria by the Royal Navy had little effect on the opposition which led to the landing of a British expeditionary force at both ends of the Suez Canal in August 1882.

The British succeeded in defeating the Egyptian Army at Tel El Kebir in September and took control of the country putting Tawfiq back in control. The purpose of the invasion had been to restore political stability to Egypt under a government of the Khedive and international controls which were in place to streamline Egyptian financing since 1876. It is unlikely that the British expected a long-term occupation from the outset. However, Lord Cromer, Britain&#x27;s Chief Representative in Egypt at the time, viewed Egypt&#x27;s financial reforms as part of a long-term objective. Cromer took the view that political stability needed financial stability, and embarked on a programme of long-term investment in Egypt&#x27;s productive resources, above all in the cotton economy, the mainstay of the country&#x27;s export earnings.

In 1906 the Denshawai incident provoked a questioning of British rule in Egypt.
British administration ended nominally with the establishment of a protectorate and the installation of sultan Hussein Kamel in 1914, but a British military presence in Egypt lasted until June 1956.

==Sultanate of Egypt==
In 1914 as a result of the declaration of war with the Ottoman Empire, of which Egypt was nominally a part, Britain declared a Protectorate over Egypt and deposed the anti-British Khedive, Abbas Hilmi II, replacing him with his uncle Husayn Kamel, who was made Sultan of Egypt by the British. Egypt subsequently declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire.

A group known as the Wafd Delegation attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 to demand Egypt&#x27;s independence. Included in the group was political leader, Saad Zaghlul, who would later become prime minister. When the group was arrested and deported to the island of Malta, a huge uprising occurred in Egypt.

From March to April 1919, there were mass demonstrations that became uprisings. This is known in Egypt as the 1919 Revolution. Almost daily demonstrations and unrest continued throughout Egypt for the remainder of the Spring. To the surprise of the British authorities, Egyptian women also demonstrated, led by Huda Sha‘rawi (1879–1947), who would become the leading feminist voice in Egypt in the first half of the twentieth century. The first women&#x27;s demonstration was held on Sunday, 16 March 1919, and was followed by yet another one on Thursday, 20 March 1919. Egyptian women would continue to play an important and increasingly public nationalist role throughout the spring and summer of 1919 and beyond.

Initially, the British authorities deployed the police force in Cairo in response to the demonstrations, though control was soon handed over to Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) troops under the command of Major-General H. D. Watson. By the summer of 1919, the disturbances had largely been suppressed; more than 800 Egyptians had been killed, as well as 31 European civilians and 29 British soldiers. In November 1919, the Milner Commission was sent to Egypt by the British to attempt to resolve the situation. In 1920, Lord Milner submitted his report to Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Secretary, recommending that the protectorate should be replaced by a treaty of alliance. As a result, Curzon agreed to receive an Egyptian mission headed by Zaghlul and Adli Pasha to discuss the proposals. The mission arrived in London in June 1920 and the agreement was concluded in August 1920.

In February 1921, the British Parliament approved the agreement and Egypt was asked to send another mission to London with full powers to conclude a definitive treaty. Adli Pasha led this mission, which arrived in June 1921. However, the Dominion delegates at the 1921 Imperial Conference had stressed the importance of maintaining control over the Suez Canal Zone and Curzon could not persuade his Cabinet colleagues to agree to any terms that Adli Pasha was prepared to accept. The mission returned to Egypt in disgust.

==Kingdom of Egypt==

In December 1921, the British authorities in Cairo imposed martial law and once again deported Zaghlul. Demonstrations again led to violence. In deference to the growing nationalism and at the suggestion of the High Commissioner, Lord Allenby, the UK unilaterally declared Egyptian independence on 28 February 1922. Sultan Fuad I was subsequently proclaimed King of Egypt.

Britain, however, continued to retain a strong influence in the newborn Kingdom of Egypt. British guided the king and retained control of the Canal Zone, Sudan and Egypt&#x27;s external and military affairs. King Fuad died in 1936 and King Farouk inherited the throne at the age of sixteen. Alarmed by the Second Italo-Abyssinian War when Italy invaded Ethiopia, he signed the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt by 1949, except at the Suez Canal.

During World War II, British troops used Egypt as its primary base for all Allied operations throughout the region. British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947, but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the war.

==Republic of Egypt==
===Coup of 1952===

On 22–26 July 1952, a group of disaffected army officers (the &quot;free officers&quot;) led by Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser overthrew King Farouk, whom the military blamed for Egypt&#x27;s poor performance in the 1948 war with Israel. Popular expectations for immediate reforms led to the workers&#x27; riots in Kafr Dawar on 12 August 1952, which resulted in two death sentences. Following a brief experiment with civilian rule, the Free Officers abrogated the 1953 constitution and declared Egypt a republic on 18 June 1953.

===Nasser&#x27;s rule===

====Emergence of Arab socialism====

Nasser evolved into a charismatic leader, not only of Egypt but of the Arab world, promoting and implementing &quot;Arab socialism.&quot;

When the United States held up military sales in reaction to Egyptian neutrality regarding the Soviet Union, Nasser concluded an arms deal with Czechoslovakia in September 1955.

When the US and the World Bank withdrew their offer to help finance the Aswan High Dam in mid-1956, Nasser nationalized the privately owned Suez Canal Company. The crisis that followed, exacerbated by growing tensions with Israel over guerrilla attacks from Gaza and Israeli reprisals, support for the FLN&#x27;s war of liberation against the French in Algeria and against Britain&#x27;s presence in the Arab world, resulted in the invasion of Egypt in October by France, Britain, and Israel. This was also known as the Suez War. According to the historian Abd aI-Azim Ramadan, Nasser&#x27;s decision to nationalize the Suez Canal was his alone, made without political or military consultation. The events leading up to the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, as other events during Nasser&#x27;s rule, showed Nasser&#x27;s inclination to solitary decision making. He considers Nasser to be far from a rational, responsible leader.

====United Arab Republic====

In 1958 Egypt joined with the Republic of Syria and annexed the Gaza Strip, ruled by the All-Palestine Government, to form a state called the United Arab Republic. It existed until Syria&#x27;s secession in 1961, although Egypt continued to be known as the UAR until 1971.

Nasser helped establish with India and Yugoslavia the Non-Aligned Movement of developing countries in September 1961, and continued to be a leading force in the movement until his death.

====Regional intervention====
Nasser had looked to a regime change in Yemen since 1957 and finally put his desires into practice in January 1962 by giving the Free Yemen Movement office space, financial support, and radio air time. Anthony Nutting&#x27;s biography of Gamal Abdel-Nasser identifies several factors that led the Egyptian President to send expeditionary forces to Yemen. These included the unraveling of the union with Syria in 1961, which dissolved his United Arab Republic (UAR), damaging his prestige. A quick decisive victory in Yemen could help him recover leadership of the Arab world. Nasser also had his reputation as an anti-colonial force, setting his sights on ridding South Yemen, and its strategic port city of Aden, of British forces.

Nasser ruled as an autocrat but remained extremely popular within Egypt and throughout the Arab world. His willingness to stand up to the Western powers and to Israel won him support throughout the region. However, Nasser&#x27;s independent foreign policy led to Israel launching the Six-Day War in 1967. This conflict saw the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian armed forces routed by the Israelis.

Israel afterward occupied the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, Golan Heights from Syria, and West Bank from Jordan. This defeat was a severe blow to Nasser&#x27;s prestige both at home and abroad. Following the defeat, Nasser made a dramatic offer to resign, which was only retracted in the face of mass demonstrations urging him to stay. The last three years of his control over Egypt were far more subdued.

===Sadat era===

Sadat era refers to the presidency of Muhammad Anwar al-Sadat, the eleven-year period of Egyptian history spanning from the death of president Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1970, through Sadat&#x27;s assassination by fundamentalist army officers on 6 October 1981. Sadat&#x27;s presidency saw many changes in Egypt&#x27;s direction, reversing some of the economic and political principles of Nasserism by breaking with Soviet Union to make Egypt an ally of the United States, initiated the peace process with Israel, re-instituting the multi-party system and abandoning socialism by launching the Infitah economic policy.

====Under Soviet influence====
After Nasser&#x27;s death, another of the original revolutionary &quot;free officers,&quot; Vice President Anwar el-Sadat, was elected President of Egypt. Nasser&#x27;s supporters in government settled on Sadat as a transitional figure that (they believed) could be manipulated easily. However, Sadat had a long term in office and many changes in mind for Egypt and by some astute political moves was able to institute a &quot;corrective revolution&quot;, (announced on 15 May 1971) which purged the government, political and security establishments of the most ardent Nasserists. Sadat encouraged the emergence of an Islamist movement which had been suppressed by Nasser. Believing Islamists to be socially conservative he gave them &quot;considerable cultural and ideological autonomy&quot; in exchange for political support.

Following the disastrous Six-Day War of 1967, Egypt waged a War of Attrition in the Suez Canal zone. In 1971, three years into this war, Sadat endorsed in a letter the peace proposals of UN negotiator Gunnar Jarring, which seemed to lead to a full peace with Israel on the basis of Israel&#x27;s withdrawal to its pre-war borders. This peace initiative failed as neither Israel nor the United States of America accepted the terms as discussed then. To provide Israel with more incentive to negotiate with Egypt and return the Sinai to it, and also because the Soviets had refused Sadat&#x27;s requests for more military support, Sadat expelled the Soviet military advisers from Egypt and proceeded to bolster his army for a renewed confrontation with Israel.

In the months before the 1973 war Sadat engaged in a diplomatic offensive and by the fall of 1973 had support for a war of more than a hundred states, including most of the countries of the Arab League, Non-Aligned Movement, and Organization of African Unity. Syria agreed to join Egypt in attacking Israel.

In October 1973, Egypt&#x27;s armed forces achieved initial successes in the Crossing and advanced 15 km, reaching the depth of the range of safe coverage of its own air force. After Syrian forces were being repulsed, the Syrian government urged Sadat to move his forces deeper into Sinai. Without air cover, the Egyptian army suffered huge losses. In spite of huge losses they kept advancing, creating the chance to open a gap between army forces. That gap was exploited by a tank division led by Ariel Sharon, and he and his tanks managed to penetrate, reaching Suez City. In the meantime, the United States initiated a strategic airlift to provide replacement weapons and supplies to Israel and appropriate $2.2 billion in emergency aid. OPEC oil ministers, led by Saudi Arabia retaliated with an oil embargo against the US. A UN resolution supported by the United States and the Soviet Union called for an end to hostilities and for peace talks to begin. On 4 March 1974 Israel withdrew the last of its troops from the west side of the Suez Canal and 12 days later Arab oil ministers announced the end of the embargo against the United States. For Sadat and many Egyptians the war was much more a victory than a draw, as the military objective of capturing a foothold of the Sinai was achieved.

====Under Western influence====

In foreign relations Sadat instigated momentous change. President Sadat shifted Egypt from a policy of confrontation with Israel to one of peaceful accommodation through negotiations. Following the of 1974 and 1975, Sadat created a fresh opening for progress by his dramatic visit to Jerusalem in November 1977. This led to the invitation from President Jimmy Carter of the United States to President Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Begin to enter trilateral negotiations at Camp David.

The outcome was the historic Camp David accords, signed by Egypt and Israel and witnessed by the US on 17 September 1978. The accords led to 26 March 1979, signing of the Egypt–Israel peace treaty, by which Egypt regained control of the Sinai in May 1982. Throughout this period, US–Egyptian relations steadily improved, and Egypt became one of America&#x27;s largest recipients of foreign aid. Sadat&#x27;s willingness to break ranks by making peace with Israel earned him the enmity of most other Arab states, however. In 1977, Egypt fought a short border war with Libya.

Sadat used his immense popularity with the Egyptian people to try to push through vast economic reforms that ended the socialistic controls of Nasserism. Sadat introduced greater political freedom and a new economic policy, the most important aspect of which was the infitah or &quot;open door&quot;. This relaxed government controls over the economy and encouraged private investment. While the reforms created a wealthy and successful upper class and a small middle class, these reforms had little effect upon the average Egyptian who began to grow dissatisfied with Sadat&#x27;s rule. In 1977, Infitah policies led to massive spontaneous riots (&#x27;Bread Riots&#x27;) involving hundreds of thousands of Egyptians when the state announced that it was retiring subsidies on basic foodstuffs.

Liberalization also included the reinstitution of due process and the legal banning of torture. Sadat dismantled much of the existing political machine and brought to trial a number of former government officials accused of criminal excesses during the Nasser era. Sadat tried to expand participation in the political process in the mid-1970s but later abandoned this effort. In the last years of his life, Egypt was wracked by violence arising from discontent with Sadat&#x27;s rule and sectarian tensions, and it experienced a renewed measure of repression including extra judicial arrests.

====Conflict with the Muslim Brotherhood====
Another change Sadat made from the Nasser era was a bow towards the Islamic revival. Sadat loosened restrictions on the Muslim Brotherhood, allowing it to publish a monthly magazine, al-Dawa, which appeared regularly until September 1981 (although he did not allow the group&#x27;s reconstitution.) 
In the late 1970s, he began calling himself &#x27;The Believer President&#x27; and signing his name &quot;Mohammad&quot; Anwar Sadat.&#x27; He ordered Egypt&#x27;s state-run television to interrupt programs with Salat (call to prayer) on the screen five times a day and to increase religious programming. Under his rule local officials banned the sale of alcohol except at places catering to foreign tourists in more than half of Egypt&#x27;s 26 governorates. 2

=== Mubarak era===
====Presidential inauguration====
On 6 October 1981, President Sadat was assassinated by Islamic extremists. Hosni Mubarak, Vice President since 1975 and an air force commander during the October 1973 war, was elected president later that month. He was subsequently confirmed by popular referendum for three more 6-year terms, most recently in September 2005. The results of the referendums are however of questionable validity as they, with the exception of the one conducted in September 2005, listed only Mubarak as the sole candidate.

Mubarak maintained Egypt&#x27;s commitment to the Camp David peace process, while at the same time re-establishing Egypt&#x27;s position as an Arab leader. Egypt was readmitted to the Arab League in 1989. Egypt also has played a moderating role in such international forums as the UN and the Nonaligned Movement.

====1990s – economic reforms and struggle with radical Islamists====

From 1991, Mubarak undertook an ambitious domestic economic reform program to reduce the size of the public sector and expand the role of the private sector. During the 1990s, a series of International Monetary Fund arrangements, coupled with massive external debt relief resulting from Egypt&#x27;s participation in the Gulf War coalition, helped Egypt improve its macroeconomic performance. The economy of Egypt flourished during the 1990s and 2000s. The Government of Egypt tamed inflation bringing it down from double-digit to a single digit. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) increased fourfold between 1981 and 2006, from US$1355 in 1981, to US$2525 in 1991, to US$3686 in 2001 and to an estimated US$4535 in 2006.

There was less progress in political reform. The November 2000 People&#x27;s Assembly elections saw 34 members of the opposition win seats in the 454-seat assembly, facing a clear majority of 388 ultimately affiliated with the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP). A constitutional amendment in May 2005 changed the presidential election to a multicandidate popular vote rather than a popular validation of a candidate nominated by the People&#x27;s Assembly and on 7 September Mubarak was elected for another six-year term with 87 percent of the popular vote, followed by a distant but strong showing by Ayman Nour, leader of the opposition Ghad Party and a well-known rights activist.

Shortly after mounting an unprecedented presidential campaign, Nour was jailed on forgery charges critics called phony; he was released on 18 February 2009. Brotherhood members were allowed to run for parliament in 2005 as independents, garnering 88 seats, or 20 percent of the People&#x27;s Assembly.

The opposition parties have been weak and divided and are not yet credible alternatives to the NDP. The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, had remained an illegal organization and may not be recognized as a political party (current Egyptian law prohibits the formation of political parties based on religion). Members are known publicly and openly speak their views. Members of the Brotherhood have been elected to the People&#x27;s Assembly and local councils as independents. The Egyptian political opposition also includes groups and popular movements such as Kefaya and the 6 April Youth Movement, although they are somewhat less organized than officially registered political parties. Bloggers, or cyberactivists as Courtney C. Radsch terms them, have also played an important political opposition role, writing, organizing, and mobilizing public opposition.

====Decrease of influence====
President Mubarak had tight, autocratic control over Egypt. However, a dramatic drop in support for Mubarak and his domestic economic reform program increased with surfacing news about his son Alaa being extremely corrupt and favored in government tenders and privatization. As Alaa started getting out of the picture by 2000, Mubarak&#x27;s second son Gamal started rising in the National Democratic Party and succeeded in getting a newer generation of neo-liberals into the party and eventually the government. Gamal Mubarak branched out with a few colleagues to set up Medinvest Associates Ltd., which manages a private equity fund, and to do some corporate finance consultancy work.

=== Civil unrest 2011-2014 ===
====2011 revolution and aftermath====

Beginning on 25 January 2011, a series of street demonstrations, protests, and civil disobedience acts have taken place in Egypt, with organizers counting on the Tunisian uprising to inspire the crowds to mobilize. The demonstrations and riots were reported to have started over police brutality, state of emergency laws, unemployment, desire to raise the minimum wage, lack of housing, food inflation, corruption, lack of freedom of speech, and poor living conditions.
The protests&#x27; main goal was to oust President Hosni Mubarak&#x27;s regime.

On 11 February 2011, Mubarak resigned and fled Cairo. Vice President Omar Suleiman announced that Mubarak had stepped down and that the Egyptian military would assume control of the nation&#x27;s affairs in the short term. (See also &quot;2011 revolution&quot;.) Jubilant celebrations broke out in Tahrir Square at the news. Mubarak may have left Cairo for Sharm el-Sheikh the previous night, before or shortly after the airing of a taped speech in which Mubarak vowed he would not step down or leave.

On 13 February 2011, the high level military command of Egypt announced that both the constitution and the parliament of Egypt had been dissolved. The parliamentary election was to be held in September.

A constitutional referendum was held on 19 March 2011. On 28 November 2011, Egypt held its first parliamentary election since the previous regime had been in power. Turnout was high and there were no reports of irregularities or violence, although members of some parties broke the ban on campaigning at polling places by handing out pamphlets and banners.

A constituent assembly, founded on 26 March 2012, started to work for implementing a new constitution. Presidential elections, were held in March–June 2012, with a final runoff between former prime minister Ahmed Shafik and Muslim Brotherhood parliamentarian Mohamed Morsi. On 24 June 2012, Egypt&#x27;s election commission announced that Morsi had won the run-off. On 30 June 2012, Mohamed Morsi was sworn in as Egypt’s new president.

==== Morsi&#x27;s presidency ====
On 8 July 2012, Egypt&#x27;s new president Mohamed Morsi said that he&#x27;s overriding a military edict that dissolved the country&#x27;s elected parliament and calling on lawmakers back into session.

On 10 July 2012, the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt negated the decision by President Mohamed Morsi to call the nation&#x27;s parliament back into session.
On 2 August 2012, Egypt&#x27;s Prime Minister Hisham Qandil announced his 35-member cabinet comprising 28 newcomers including four from the influential Muslim Brotherhood, six others and the former military ruler Tantawi as the Defence Minister from the previous Government.

====2012-2013 Egyptian protests====

On 22 November 2012, Egyptian Mohamed Morsi issued a declaration immunizing his decrees from challenge and seeking to protect the work of the Constituent Assembly drafting the new constitution. The declaration also requires a retrial of those accused in the Mubarak-era killings of protesters, who had been acquitted, and extends the mandate of the constituent assembly by two months. Additionally, the declaration authorizes Morsi to take any measures necessary to protect the revolution. Liberal and secular groups previously walked out of the constitutional constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose strict Islamic practices, while Muslim Brotherhood backers threw their support behind Morsi.

A constitutional referendum was held in two rounds on 15 and 22 December 2012, with 64% support, and 33% against. It was signed into law by a presidential decree issued by Morsi on 26 December 2012.

The move has been criticized by Mohamed ElBaradei who stated &quot;Morsi today usurped all state powers &amp; appointed himself Egypt&#x27;s new pharaoh&quot; on his Twitter feed. The move has led to massive protests and violent action throughout Egypt.

==== After Morsi ====

On 30 June 2013, on the first anniversary of the election of Morsi, millions of protesters across Egypt took to the streets and demanded the immediate resignation of the president. On 1 July, the Egyptian Armed Forces issued a 48-hour ultimatum that gave the country&#x27;s political parties until 3 July to meet the demands of the Egyptian people. The presidency rejected the Egyptian Army&#x27;s 48-hour ultimatum, vowing that the president would pursue his own plans for national reconciliation to resolve the political crisis. On 3 July, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, head of the Egyptian Armed Forces, announced that he had removed Morsi from power, suspended the constitution and would be calling new presidential and Shura Council elections and named Supreme Constitutional Court&#x27;s leader, Adly Mansour as acting president. Mansour was sworn in on 4 July 2013.

During the months after the coup d&#x27;état, a new constitution was prepared, which took effect on 18 January 2014. After that, presidential and parliamentary elections have to be held within 6 months.

=== El-Sisi Presidency ===
In the elections of June 2014 El-Sisi won with a percentage of 96.1%. On 8 June 2014, Abdel Fatah el-Sisi was officially sworn in as Egypt&#x27;s new president. Under President el-Sisi, Egypt has implemented a rigorous policy of controlling the border to the Gaza Strip, including the dismantling of tunnels between the Gaza strip and Sinai.

In April 2018, El-Sisi was re-elected by landslide in election with no real opposition. In April 2019, Egypt’s parliament extended presidential terms from four to six years. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was also allowed to run for third term in next election in 2024.

Under El-Sisi Egypt is said to have returned to authoritarianism. New constitutional reforms have been implemented, meaning strengthening the role of military and limiting the political opposition. The constitutional changes were accepted in a referendum in April 2019.

In December 2020, final results of the parliamentary election confirmed a clear majority of the seats for Egypt’s Mostaqbal Watn (Nation’s Future) Party, which strongly supports president El-Sisi. The party even increased its majority, partly because of new electoral rules.

During the 2020–2021 Tigray War, Egypt was also involved. On 19 December 2020, an EEPA report stated, based on testimonials of three Egyptian officials and one European diplomat, that the UAE used its base in Assab (Eritrea) to launch drones strikes against Tigray. The investigative platform Bellingcat confirmed the presence of Chinese-produced drones at the UAE&#x27;s military base in Assab, Eritrea. Egyptian officials were concerned about strengthening ties between the UAE and Israel. They fear that both countries will collaborate in the construction of an alternative to the Suez Canal, starting from Haifa in Israel. On 19 December 2020, Egypt was reportedly encouraging Sudan to support the TPLF in Tigray. It wants to strengthen a joint position in relation to negotiations on the GERD Dam, which impacts both countries downstream.
