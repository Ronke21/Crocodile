<text>AS-203 (also known as SA-203 or Apollo 3) was an uncrewed flight of the Saturn IB rocket on July 5, 1966. It carried no command and service module, as its purpose was to verify the design of the S-IVB rocket stage restart capability that would later be used in the Apollo program to boost astronauts from Earth orbit to a trajectory towards the Moon. It achieved its objectives, but the S-IVB was inadvertently destroyed after four orbits during a differential pressure test that exceeded the design limits.

==Objectives==
The purpose of the AS-203 flight was to investigate the effects of weightlessness on the liquid hydrogen fuel in the S-IVB-200 second-stage tank. The lunar missions would use a modified version of the S-IVB-200, the S-IVB-500, as the third stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. This called for the stage to fire briefly to insert the spacecraft into an Earth parking orbit, before restarting the engine for flight to the Moon. In order to design this capability, engineers needed to verify that the anti-slosh measures designed to control the hydrogen&#x27;s location in the tank were adequate, and that the fuel lines and engines could be kept at the proper temperatures to allow engine restart.

In order to keep residual propellants in the tanks on orbit, there would be no command and service module payload as there was on AS-201 and AS-202, with an aerodynamic nose cone in the place of the payload. Also, the full load of liquid oxygen oxidizer was shorted slightly so that the amount of hydrogen remaining would approximate that of the Saturn V parking orbit. The tank was equipped with 88 sensors and two TV cameras to record the fuel&#x27;s behavior.

This was also the first launch of a Saturn IB from Pad 37B.

==Preparation==
In the spring of 1966, the decision was made to launch AS-203 before AS-202, as the CSM that was to be flown on AS-202 was delayed. The S-IVB stage arrived at Cape Kennedy on 6 April 1966; the S-IB first stage arrived six days later, and the Instrument Unit came two days after that.

On April 19, technicians began to erect the booster at Pad 37B. Once again, the testing regimen ran into problems that had plagued AS-201, including cracked solder joints in the printed-circuit boards, requiring over 8,000 to be replaced.

==Flight==
The rocket launched on the first attempt on July 5. The S-IVB and Instrument Unit (IU) were inserted into a circular orbit.

The S-IVB design test objectives were carried out on the first two orbits, and the hydrogen was found to behave mostly as predicted, with sufficient control over its location and of engine temperatures required for restart. The next two orbits were used for extra experiments to obtain information for use in future cryogenic stage designs. These included a free-coast experiment to observe and control the negative acceleration of the fuel caused by the small amount of aerodynamic drag on the vehicle; a rapid fuel tank depressurization test; and a closed fuel tank pressurization test.

The closed fuel tank experiment involved pressurizing the hydrogen tank by closing its vents, while depressurizing the oxygen tank by allowing it to continue venting. It was expected that the pressure difference between the two tanks (measured as high as would collapse the common bulkhead separating them, as happened in a ground test. The rupture occurred during the two-minute loss of signal between the Manned Spacecraft Center and the Trinidad tracking station. The Trinidad radar image indicated the vehicle was in multiple pieces, and telemetry was never re-acquired. NASA concluded that a spark or impact must have ignited the propellants, causing an explosion.

Despite the destruction of the stage, the mission was classified as a success, having achieved all of its primary objectives and validating the design concept of the restartable S-IVB-500 version. In September Douglas Aircraft Company, which built the S-IVB, declared that the design was ready for use on the Saturn V to send men to the Moon.

<doc id="380509" wikidata="Q1570293" url="?curid=380509" title="Terms of trade">
<text>The terms of trade (TOT) is the relative price of exports in terms of imports and is defined as the ratio of export prices to import prices. It can be interpreted as the amount of import goods an economy can purchase per unit of export goods.

An improvement of a nation&#x27;s terms of trade benefits that country in the sense that it can buy more imports for any given level of exports. The terms of trade may be influenced by the exchange rate because a rise in the value of a country&#x27;s currency lowers the domestic prices of its imports but may not directly affect the prices of the commodities it exports.

== History ==

The expression &quot;terms of trade&quot; was first coined by the US American economist Frank William Taussig in his 1927 book &quot;International Trade&quot;. However, an earlier version of the concept can be traced back to the English economist Robert Torrens and his book &quot;The Budget: On Commercial and Colonial Policy&quot;, published in 1844, as well as to John Stuart Mill&#x27;s essay &quot;Of the Laws of Interchange between Nations; and the Distribution of Gains of Commerce among the Countries of the Commercial World&quot;, published in the same year, though allegedly already written in 1829/30.

==Definition==
Terms of trade (TOT) is a measure of how much imports an economy can get for a unit of exported goods. For example, if an economy is only exporting apples and only importing oranges, then the terms of trade are simply the price of apples divided by the price of oranges — in other words, how many oranges can be obtained for a unit of apples. Since economies export and import many goods, measuring the TOT requires defining price indices for exported and imported goods and comparing the two.

A rise in the prices of exported goods in international markets would increase the TOT, while a rise in the prices of imported goods would decrease it. For example, countries that export oil will see an increase in their TOT when oil prices go up, while the TOT of countries that import oil would decrease.

==Two country model CIE economics==
In the simplified case of two countries and two commodities, terms of trade is defined as the ratio of the total export revenue a country receives for its export commodity to the total import revenue it pays for its import commodity. In this case, the imports of one country are the exports of the other country. For example, if a country exports 50 dollars&#x27; worth of product in exchange for 100 dollars&#x27; worth of imported product, that country&#x27;s terms of trade are 50/100 = 0.5. The terms of trade for the other country must be the reciprocal (100/50 = 2). When this number is falling, the country is said to have &quot;deteriorating terms of trade&quot;. If multiplied by 100, these calculations can be expressed as a percentage (50% and 200% respectively). If a country&#x27;s terms of trade fall from say 100% to 70% (from 1.0 to 0.7), it has experienced a 30% deterioration in its terms of trade. When doing longitudinal (time series) calculations, it is common to set a value for the base year to make interpretation of the results easier.

In basic microeconomics, the terms of trade are usually set in the interval between the opportunity costs for the production of a given good of two nations.

Terms of trade is the ratio of a country&#x27;s export price index to its import price index, multiplied by 100.
The terms of trade measures the rate of exchange of one good or service for another when two countries trade with each other.

==Multi-commodity multi-country model==

In the more realistic case of many products exchanged between many countries, terms of trade can be calculated using a Laspeyres index. In this case, a nation&#x27;s terms of trade is the ratio of the Laspeyre price index of exports to the Laspeyre price index of imports. The Laspeyre export index is the current value of the base period exports divided by the base period value of the base period exports. Similarly, the Laspeyres import index is the current value of the base period imports divided by the base period value of the base period imports.

:formula_4 price of exports in the base period

:formula_5 price of imports in the current period

:formula_6 quantity of imports in the base period

:formula_7 price of imports in the base period
==Limitations==
Terms of trade should not be used as synonymous with social welfare, or even Pareto economic welfare. Terms of trade calculations do not tell us about the volume of the countries&#x27; exports, only relative changes between countries. To understand how a country&#x27;s social utility changes, it is necessary to consider changes in the volume of trade, changes in productivity and resource allocation, and changes in capital flows.

The price of exports from a country can be heavily influenced by the value of its currency, which can in turn be heavily influenced by the interest rate in that country. If the value of currency of a particular country is increased due to an increase in interest rate one can expect the terms of trade to improve. However, this may not necessarily mean an improved standard of living for the country since an increase in the price of exports perceived by other nations will result in a lower volume of exports. As a result, exporters in the country may actually be struggling to sell their goods in the international market even though they are enjoying a (supposedly) high price.

In the real world of over 200 nations trading hundreds of thousands of products, terms of trade calculations can get very complex. Thus, the possibility of errors is significant.

<doc id="380511" wikidata="Q166845" url="?curid=380511" title="Maverick (TV series)">
<text>Maverick is an American Western television series with comedic overtones created by Roy Huggins and originally starring James Garner as an adroitly articulate poker player plying his trade on riverboats and in saloons while traveling incessantly through the 19th-century American frontier. The show ran for five seasons from September 22, 1957, to July 8, 1962 on ABC.

==Overview==
&quot;Maverick&quot; initially starred James Garner as poker player Bret Maverick. Eight episodes into the first season, he was joined by Jack Kelly as his brother Bart Maverick, and for the remainder of the first three seasons, Garner and Kelly alternated leads from week to week, sometimes teaming up for the occasional two-brother episode. The Maverick brothers were both poker players from Texas who traveled the American Old West by horseback and stagecoach, and on Mississippi riverboats, constantly getting into and out of life-threatening trouble of one sort or another, usually involving money, women, or both. Though the Mavericks were quick to claim they were motivated by money, and made a point of humorously emphasizing their supposed belief in cowardice and avoiding hard work, in many episodes they would find themselves weighing a financial windfall against a moral dilemma. Their consciences always trumped their wallets since both Mavericks were intrinsically ethical, although they were not above trying to fleece someone who had clearly &quot;proven&quot; themselves to be fundamentally dishonest or corrupt.

When Garner left the series after the third season due to a legal dispute, after which he enjoyed a successful film career, Roger Moore was added to the cast as cousin Beau Maverick. As before, the two starring Mavericks would generally alternate as series leads, with an occasional &quot;team-up&quot; episode. Partway through the fourth season, Garner look-alike Robert Colbert replaced Moore and played a third Maverick brother, Brent. No more than two series leads (of the four total for the run of the series) ever appeared together in the same episode, and most episodes featured only one. All two-Maverick episodes included Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick. For the fifth and final season, the show returned to a &quot;single Maverick&quot; format as it had been originally in the first seven episodes, with all the remaining new episodes starring Kelly as Bart. The new episodes, however, alternated with reruns from earlier seasons starring Garner as Bret.

Budd Boetticher directed the first three episodes of the first season until sharply disagreeing with Huggins about Maverick&#x27;s philosophy, which resulted in Boetticher assigning Bret Maverick&#x27;s scripted lines to supporting characters and filming the result, thereby attempting to change the whole series by making Maverick into a more conventional Western hero as found in the earlier Boetticher-directed series of classic Western theatrical films starring Randolph Scott.

Robert Altman wrote and directed the fourth season episode titled &quot;Bolt from the Blue&quot; starring Roger Moore as Beau Maverick.

The show was part of the Warner Bros. array of TV Westerns, which included &quot;Cheyenne&quot; with Clint Walker, &quot;Colt .45&quot; with Wayde Preston, &quot;Lawman&quot; with John Russell, &quot;Bronco&quot; with Ty Hardin, &quot;The Alaskans&quot; with Roger Moore, and &quot;Sugarfoot&quot; with Will Hutchins.

==Cast==
=== James Garner as Bret Maverick ===

James Garner starred as Bret Maverick, the epitome of a poker-playing rounder, always seeking out high-stakes games and rarely remaining in one place for long. The show is generally cited as Garner&#x27;s career breakout; his most prominent prior part was a major supporting role in &quot;Sayonara&quot; (1957) starring Marlon Brando. &quot;Maverick&quot; shocked the industry by quickly besting the powerful &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; in the television ratings.

Huggins inverted the usual cowboy hero characteristics familiar to television and film viewers of the time. Bret Maverick was vocally reluctant to risk his life, though he typically ended up being courageous in spite of himself. He frequently flimflammed adversaries, but only those who deserved it. Otherwise he was honest almost to a fault, in at least one case insisting on repaying a questionable large debt (in &quot;According to Hoyle&quot;).

None of the Mavericks were particularly fast draws with a pistol. Bart Maverick once commented to a lady friend, &quot;My brother Bret can outdraw me any day of the week, and he&#x27;s known as the Second Slowest Gun in the West.&quot; However, it was almost impossible for anyone to beat either of them in any sort of a fistfight, perhaps the one cowboy cliché that Huggins left intact.

Garner appeared in three seasons and a single held-back episode broadcast in the middle of the fourth season. Leaving aside the short introductions of Jack Kelly episodes in the first season meant to acclimate viewers to Kelly, Garner appeared in 52 episodes altogether.

=== Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick ===
Though James Garner was originally supposed to be the only Maverick, the studio eventually hired Jack Kelly to play brother Bart, starting with the eighth episode. The producers had realized that it took over a week to shoot a single episode, meaning that at some point the studio would run out of finished episodes to televise during the season, so Kelly was hired to rotate with Garner as the series lead, using two separate crews (while occasionally appearing together). In Bart&#x27;s first episode, &quot;Hostage,&quot; to engender audience empathy for the new character, the script called for him to be tied up and beaten by an evil police officer.

According to series creator Roy Huggins in an interview with the Archive of American Television, the two brothers were purposely written to be virtual clones, with no apparent differences inherent in the scripts whatsoever. This included being traveling poker players, loving money, professing to be cowards (despite voluminous evidence to the contrary), spouting enigmatic words of advice their &quot;Pappy&quot; passed down to them, and carrying a $1,000 bill pinned to the inside of a coat for emergency purposes. There was, however, one distinct—but accidental—difference between the two. Garner&#x27;s episodes tended to be more comedic due to his obvious talent in that area, while Kelly&#x27;s were inclined to be more dramatic. Huggins noted in the interview that Kelly, while funnier than Garner off-camera, dropped a funny line while shooting a scene &quot;like a load of coal&quot;. To get viewers used to the idea of a second Maverick, Garner filmed a series of brief vignettes that aired at the beginning of the Kelly-only episodes during much of the first season where he would introduce the evening&#x27;s story. To foster as much parity as possible, Kelly did the same in a Garner-only episode, &quot;Black Fire&quot;, by appearing in the opening vignette to introduce the story and narrating the episode itself.

Huggins observed that the ratings for Kelly&#x27;s episodes were always slightly higher during the first two seasons than Garner&#x27;s. Huggins stated that he believed that this was a reflection of how well the audience liked Garner&#x27;s episodes and the consequent word of mouth, so that viewers would be at their sets for the following episode, which would usually feature Kelly instead. The rating jumps for Kelly&#x27;s episodes were tiny enough that they fell within the margin of error, according to Huggins in this interview, but he maintains that they were remarkable in that they were consistent.

The episodes featuring both Garner and Kelly were audience favorites. Bret and Bart often found themselves competing for women or money, or working together in some elaborate scheme to swindle someone who had just robbed one of them. Bret and Bart technically appeared together in sixteen episodes over the course of the series, but only shared a large amount of screen time in eleven of them (&quot;Hostage,&quot; &quot;The Wrecker,&quot; &quot;Trail West to Fury,&quot; &quot;Seed of Deception,&quot; &quot;Shady Deal at Sunny Acres,&quot; &quot;Game of Chance,&quot; &quot;Two Beggars on Horseback,&quot; &quot;Pappy,&quot; &quot;Maverick Springs,&quot; &quot;Maverick and Juliet,&quot; and &quot;The Maverick Line&quot;). All but one of the other two-brother episodes are actually Garner-starring episodes with cameo appearances by Kelly, the exception being &quot;The Jeweled Gun&quot;, in which their roles were switched at the last minute due to a schedule conflict and Garner wound up making his single cameo appearance in a Kelly episode.

Though it was never said explicitly, Bret appears to be older, stating once in response to someone mentioning lightning striking twice in the same place, &quot;That&#x27;s just what my Pappy said when he looked in my brother Bart&#x27;s crib.&quot; (Episode #22 — &quot;A Flock of Trouble&quot;) In real life, Kelly was seven months older than Garner. Kelly wound up being the only Maverick to appear in all five seasons of the series in the wake of Garner&#x27;s contentious departure after the third season.

=== Roger Moore as Beau Maverick ===

When Garner quit over a contract dispute with the studio after the series&#x27; third year, he was replaced by Roger Moore as cousin Beau, namesake nephew of Beau &quot;Pappy&quot; Maverick. Sean Connery was originally offered the role but turned it down. (Famously, the following decade, Moore would replace Connery as James Bond in the 007-film series.) Moore had earlier played a completely different role in season 2, episode 18, &quot;The Rivals&quot; (loosely based on the 1775 play, &quot;The Rivals&quot;), a drawing room comedy episode with Garner in which Moore&#x27;s character switched identities with Bret.

Beau&#x27;s first appearance was in the season four opener, &quot;The Bundle from Britain&quot;, in which he returns from an extended stay in England to meet cousin Bart, used to explain Moore&#x27;s obvious English accent. Moore was almost exactly the same age as Kelly and brought a flair for light comedy fitting the show. Moore noted in his autobiography that the producers told him he was not being brought in to replace Garner. However, when he got to wardrobe, all of his costumes had the name &quot;Jim Garner&quot; scratched out on the tags. Moore also mentioned in the book that he, Garner, Kelly, and their wives would regularly gather at the Kelly home for what they called &quot;poker school&quot;.

There was also a dispute between the cast and producers during this time over the long hours they were putting in each day. The producers placed a time clock in the makeup department and required the actors to punch in. Moore brought his own makeup, and refused to punch the clock. Moore wrote in his book that Kelly was &quot;similarly minded, and one day took the time clock and used it as a football.&quot;

Moore had already performed &quot;Maverick&quot; dialogue written for Garner in his earlier series, &quot;The Alaskans&quot;. The studio had a policy of recycling scripts through their various television series to save money on writers, changing as little dialogue as possible, usually only names and locations. Recycled scripts were often credited to &quot;W. Hermanos&quot; (Spanish for &quot;W. Brothers&quot;).

Moore quit after only fourteen episodes due to what he felt was a declining script quality (without having to resort to legal measures as Garner had). Moore stated that if he had gotten the level of writing Garner had enjoyed during the first two years of the show&#x27;s run, he would have stayed.

=== Robert Colbert as Brent Maverick ===

As ratings continued to slide following the departure of Roy Huggins and James Garner and the addition of Roger Moore, Garner lookalike Robert Colbert (whose name is pronounced phonetically, rather than in the French style like Claudette Colbert or Stephen Colbert) was cast as Bart and Bret&#x27;s brother, Brent Maverick. Colbert, who was already under contract to Warner Bros., had appeared on the show previously in the season four episode &quot;Hadley&#x27;s Hunters&quot;. Aware of his resemblance to Garner and wary of the comparisons that would inevitably result, Colbert pleaded with Warner Bros. not to cast him, saying &quot;Put me in a dress and call me Brenda, but don&#x27;t do this to me!&quot; Colbert was introduced as Brent in the season four episode titled &quot;The Forbidden City&quot;; Kelly made what amounted to an extended cameo appearance in the episode. Colbert would appear again by himself in &quot;Benefit of Doubt&quot;, briefly featuring Slim Pickens as a stagecoach driver. Those were his only appearances as Brent. For the fifth season (1961–1962), the studio simply did not call him back.

===Guest cast===

* Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as James Aloysius &quot;Dandy Jim&quot; Buckley, a dapper and sophisticated con artist, who at various times was both friend and foe to Bret but maintained a markedly warmer friendship with Bart.
* Diane Brewster as Samantha Crawford, a charming and flirtatious con woman with a beguiling fake Southern accent who managed to dupe Bret and Bart out of large sums in different episodes—but not without having a little romance with each brother first. Brewster originated the role of con-artist Crawford on &quot;Cheyenne&quot; the year before &quot;Maverick&quot; went on the air (introducing herself to Cheyenne with her full name &quot;Samantha Crawford&quot; before proceeding to double-cross and rob everyone in sight including Cheyenne himself). &quot;Samantha Crawford&quot; was the maiden name of series creator Roy Huggins&#x27; mother.
* Richard Long as John &quot;Gentleman Jack&quot; Darby. Gentleman Jack was intended to be the quasi-friendly rival opposing Bart that Dandy Jim&#x27;s character was for Bret, and was created after Zimbalist had been cast in &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; and was no longer available for lengthy appearances; Long later joined the cast of &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; himself. All four (Bret, Bart, Dandy Jim, and Gentleman Jack) appear in the episode &quot;Shady Deal at Sunny Acres&quot; but throughout the series, Gentleman Jack only had scenes with Bart among the principals.
* Leo Gordon as Big Mike McComb, Bret and Bart&#x27;s Irish friend who aided them on several adventures. Gordon, also a screenwriter, would later script some episodes of the series but none of those in which he appeared.
* Kathleen Crowley as Modesty Blaine, Melanie Blake, and Marla, leading ladies with repeated appearances in various seasons. Mona Freeman played Modesty Blaine twice while Crowley played the role once. Crowley played leading ladies in eight different episodes, a series record.
* Arlene Howell as Cindy Lou Brown, another beautiful con woman whom Bart and Gentleman Jack fought over. Cindy Lou appeared in three episodes, &quot;Alias Bart Maverick&quot;, &quot;Passage to Fort Doom&quot;, and eye-blinkingly briefly in &quot;Shady Deal at Sunny Acres&quot;.
* Gerald Mohr and Peter Breck as Doc Holliday. Mohr originally played the role in season one as a vengeful but charismatic killer in &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot;. However, in seasons four and five, Breck portrayed Holliday starkly differently as an unsettlingly unpleasant crooked rogue who was always getting Bart in trouble with his scams.
* John Dehner and Andrew Duggan each played gangster Big Ed Murphy once, among other roles in the series. 
* Mike Road played gambler Pearly Gates twice during the final season. In both his appearances, he was accompanied by Kathleen Crowley&#x27;s character named Marla.

Some performers, such as Kathleen Crowley, Tol Avery and Gage Clarke appeared seven or eight times over the course of the series in various roles. For example, character actor Chubby Johnson&#x27;s eight episodes were &quot;Stage West&quot; as a wily stagecoach depot manager, &quot;The Strange Journey of Jenny Hill&quot; as a drunken messenger in an alley, &quot;Pappy&quot; as a whiskey-serving storekeeper, &quot;The Sheriff of Duck &#x27;n&#x27; Shoot&quot; as a comically loquacious deputy, &quot;The Misfortune Teller&quot; as a different deputy, &quot;The Maverick Line&quot; as an obstreperous stagecoach driver, &quot;Destination Devil&#x27;s Flat&quot; as another deputy, and &quot;The Cactus Switch&quot; as a different stagecoach driver.

Eventual Oscar-winner Joel Grey played Billy the Kid in &quot;Full House,&quot; an unusual third-season episode that featured a bravura pistol-twirling exhibition by Garner as part of the plot.

Robert Redford, in his first professional appearance on film, joined Kelly as a major supporting player on a desperate cattle drive in &quot;The Iron Hand.&quot;

Stacy Keach Sr. played a sheriff and two different marshals in three episodes, including &quot;Ghost Rider.&quot; Edgar Buchanan portrayed extremely widely varying roles in five episodes. Ben Gage lampooned Marshal Matt Dillon of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in four different episodes, most obviously as &quot;Marshal Mort Dooley&quot; in the spoof &quot;Gun-Shy&quot; with James Garner, which sent up &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;&#x27;s entire regular cast, and more subtly in &quot;A Tale of Three Cities&quot; with Jack Kelly, &quot;The Misfortune Teller&quot; with Garner, and &quot;A Technical Error&quot; with Kelly.

Gerald Mohr appeared in seven different episodes: &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; with Bret, &quot;Seed of Deception&quot; (in a brief cameo) with Bret and Bart, &quot;The Burning Sky&quot; with Bart, &quot;Escape to Tampico&quot; with Bret, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Beat the Percentage&quot; with Bart, &quot;Mano Nera&quot; with Bart, and &quot;The Deadly Image&quot; with Bart and Bart&#x27;s evil twin.

Clint Eastwood, Slim Pickens, Lee Van Cleef, John Carradine, Buddy Ebsen, Hans Conried, Alan Hale Jr., Jim Backus, Claude Akins, subsequent Oscar-winner George Kennedy, John Gavin, Mike Connors, Chad Everett, Patric Knowles, and Adam West appeared at least once during the run of the series.

Glamorously beautiful young actresses included subsequent Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher as well as Mala Powers, Coleen Gray, Paula Raymond, Ruta Lee, Marie Windsor, Abby Dalton, Karen Steele, Dawn Wells, Connie Stevens, Merry Anders, Kaye Elhardt, Sherry Jackson, Pippa Scott, Saundra Edwards, Peggy McCay, Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Crowley, Roxane Berard and Adele Mara, some of whom appeared several times.

The show&#x27;s stentorian-voiced announcer (&quot;Maverick! Starring Jack Kelly and Robert Colbert!&quot;) was character actor Ed Reimers. Reimers was best known as spokesman for the Allstate Corporation in their long-running series of television commercials in the United States, advising viewers that they were &quot;in good hands with Allstate.&quot;

==Writers==

Writers for &quot;Maverick&quot; included creator/producer Roy Huggins (&quot;Shady Deal at Sunny Acres&quot; and &quot;Passage to Fort Doom&quot;), Russell S. Hughes (&quot;According to Hoyle&quot;, &quot;The Seventh Hand&quot;, &quot;The Burning Sky&quot;, and Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;The Wrecker&quot;), Gerald Drayson Adams (&quot;Stampede&quot;), director Montgomery Pittman (wrote the original story for &quot;The Saga of Waco Williams&quot; which became a teleplay by Gene L. Coon), director Douglas Heyes (&quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot;, &quot;The Day They Hanged Bret Maverick&quot;, &quot;Escape to Tampico&quot;, &quot;Two Beggars on Horseback&quot; and &quot;Two Tickets to Ten Strike&quot;), Marion Hargrove (&quot;The Jail at Junction Flats&quot;), Howard Browne (&quot;Duel at Sundown&quot;), Leo Townsend (&quot;The Misfortune Teller&quot;), Gene Levitt (&quot;The Comstock Conspiracy&quot;), William Driskill (&quot;The Sheriff of Duck &#x27;n&#x27; Shoot&quot;), Leo Gordon (who also acted on the series although never in an episode that he had written; apparently the studio didn&#x27;t want to foster a custom of actors writing their own scripts for television series), director Robert Altman (&quot;Bolt from the Blue&quot;) and director George Waggner (&quot;You Can&#x27;t Beat the Percentage&quot;), among many others.

==Theme song==
The memorable theme song was penned by prolific composers David Buttolph (music) and Paul Francis Webster (lyrics). Buttolph&#x27;s theme first appeared as incidental music in the Warner Bros. film of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. The theme song was only heard briefly at the show&#x27;s opening (after a teaser clip), and in an instrumental version. For the closing credits, a full-length (30-second) version was used. The prolific Buttolph&#x27;s other most remembered musical contribution was the arrangement of Alfred Newman&#x27;s stirring theme from 1940&#x27;s &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; starring Tyrone Power.

The closing theme song was entirely instrumental during season one. A vocal version with lyrics debuted partway through season two, being used intermittently in place of the instrumental version. The vocal theme finally saw regular use by the end of season two and for all seasons thereafter. The vocal theme, performed by an all-male chorus, described the lead character of Maverick (&quot;Who is the tall dark stranger there? / Maverick is the name...&quot;) – even though it debuted well after the two-Maverick format was firmly established.

==Episodes==
===Episode list===

===Notable episodes===

The first episode of &quot;Maverick&quot;, &quot;War of the Silver Kings,&quot; was based on C. B. Glasscock&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Copper Kings,&quot; which relates the real-life adventures of copper mine speculator F. Augustus Heinze who ultimately became a speculator in the New York financial district at 42 Broadway. Roy Huggins recalls in his Archive of American Television interview that this Warners-owned property was selected by the studio to replace &quot;Point Blank&quot; as the first episode to cheat him out of creator residuals. James Garner maintained in his in-depth Archive of American Television interview that he and Leo Gordon were hitting each other for real in the fight sequences, visible in the shot where Garner is hit in the stomach, slamming him backward against a door.

&quot;Shady Deal at Sunny Acres&quot; features Bret Maverick (James Garner) spending most of the episode relaxing in a rocking chair, calmly whittling and offhandedly assuring the inquisitive and derisively amused townspeople that he&#x27;s &quot;working on it,&quot; while his brother Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly) runs a complex sting operation involving all five of the series&#x27; occasionally recurring characters (Dandy Jim Buckley, Samantha Crawford, Gentleman Jack Darby, Big Mike McComb and Cindy Lou Brown) to swindle a crooked banker who had stolen Bret&#x27;s deposit of $15,000. Garner notes in his memoir, &quot;The Garner Files&quot;, that he was given the choice of which role to play, and chose the one where he spent the episode sitting down because he&#x27;d been feeling tired and overworked. It was his favorite episode. In his Archive of American Television interview, Roy Huggins contends that the first half of the later theatrical film &quot;The Sting&quot; with Paul Newman and Robert Redford was an uncredited restaging of &quot;Shady Deal at Sunny Acres.&quot;

&quot;Duel at Sundown&quot; stars Clint Eastwood as a gun-slinging villain in an epic showdown with Bret, also featuring Edgar Buchanan and Abby Dalton in large supporting roles.

The episode &quot;Escape to Tampico&quot; incorporated parts of the actual set of &quot;Rick&#x27;s Café Américain&quot; from &quot;Casablanca&quot; for &quot;La Cantina Americana,&quot; and contains many allusions to the film. At 19:19 on the DVD release there is even a short clip from the movie where actors are dressed in French Army and &quot;Heer&quot; uniforms, and Leonid Kinskey is recognizable tending the bar. The episode&#x27;s plot hinges on Gerald Mohr as a white-jacketed saloon owner, similar to Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s &quot;Casablanca&quot; character, whom Bret is sent to bring back to America because of a murder during a robbery.

Efrem Zimbalist Jr.&#x27;s dangerously eccentric but wittily amusing character Dandy Jim Buckley appears in &quot;Stampede&quot; and &quot;The Jail at Junction Flats.&quot; Zimbalist went on to play the lead in his own series, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, after five appearances on &quot;Maverick&quot; as Buckley. Huggins recruited Richard Long to fill the void as a similar character named &quot;Gentleman Jack Darby,&quot; and both Buckley and Darby appear in &quot;Shady Deal at Sunny Acres,&quot; although not in the same scenes. Zimbalist and Long eventually did appear together as regular series leads in &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, however, albeit playing characters utterly different from their &quot;Maverick&quot; roles.

&quot;The Saga of Waco Williams&quot; with Wayde Preston and Louise Fletcher (who later won an Oscar for playing the original &quot;Nurse Ratched&quot; in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;) drew the highest viewership of the entire series. Preston portrayed an ultra-heroic and utterly fearless character that had Bret Maverick breaking the fourth wall to marvel in amazement at the conclusion of the episode. Writer/producer Stephen J. Cannell noted in his Archive of American Television interview that, two decades later, he used Waco Williams as the prototype for &quot;Lance White,&quot; Tom Selleck&#x27;s recurring role on Roy Huggins&#x27; and James Garner&#x27;s subsequent series &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;.

&quot;According to Hoyle&quot; was the first &quot;Maverick&quot; appearance of Diane Brewster as roguish Samantha Crawford, a role she&#x27;d played earlier in an episode of the Western TV series &quot;Cheyenne&quot; titled &quot;The Dark Rider&quot; that was subsequently recycled with a completely different cast as the second season &quot;Maverick&quot; episode &quot;Yellow River&quot;. She later appeared as the Samantha Crawford character on &quot;Maverick&quot; with Garner in &quot;The Seventh Hand&quot; and Kelly in &quot;The Savage Hills&quot; and &quot;Shady Deal at Sunny Acres.&quot;

&quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; stars Gerald Mohr as Doc Holliday and film noir icon Marie Windsor as a saloon owner in a tense drama with Bret Maverick gingerly attempting to manipulate the terrifying gunslinger. Mohr portrayed Doc Holliday again the following year in an episode of the television series &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot; titled &quot;Doc Holliday in Durango,&quot; reprising his colorfully sardonic performance as the legendary gunfighter.

During the first two seasons, with writer/producer Roy Huggins at the helm, writers were instructed to write every script while visualizing James Garner playing the part; two-Maverick scripts denoted the brothers as &quot;Maverick 1&quot; and &quot;Maverick 2,&quot; with Garner choosing which role he would play due to his senior status on the series. The one exception to this was &quot;Passage to Fort Doom,&quot; a meditation on courage written by Huggins expressly for Jack Kelly, directed by Paul Henreid and featuring Arlene Howell, John Alderson and Diane McBain.

&quot;The Rivals&quot; is based on a sophisticated comedy of manners play written by Richard Brinsley Sheridan and first mounted in 1775. Roger Moore appears in &quot;The Rivals&quot; as a wealthy playboy who switches identities with Bret to facilitate landing a comely lass (Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Crowley) with whom he&#x27;s become infatuated. Two seasons later, Roger Moore would replace James Garner&#x27;s Bret Maverick with his own Beau Maverick when Garner left the series to successfully accelerate his movie career. This is the only episode with both James Garner and Roger Moore.

&quot;Two Tickets to Ten Strike&quot; with Connie Stevens is a hybrid of comedy, mystery and action drama spotlighting Adam West spouting amazing dialogue as an amusingly verbose villain insistently threatening Bret.

In the chilling &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; with Stacy Keach Sr., Bret learns that a weeping woman to whom he&#x27;d given a ride in a buckboard had been dead for more than a week when he met her.

A gunshot criminal confesses to Bret with his dying breath that an innocent man was locked up in jail for a murder that he didn&#x27;t commit, spurring the epic odyssey &quot;The Long Hunt.&quot;

Other examples of the numerous notable episodes include a spoof of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; titled &quot;Gun-Shy&quot;; Bret is framed for a robbery and waiting to be hung in the mistaken identity thriller &quot;The Day They Hanged Bret Maverick&quot;; the courtroom drama &quot;Rope of Cards&quot; created a run on decks of cards throughout the United States the day after its initial broadcast in the wake of Bret using a seemingly impossible card trick that actually exists; &quot;Relic of Fort Tejon&quot; features an affectionate camel who adores Bret; the corpse of a man whom Bret has just killed in self defense vanishes in &quot;The Comstock Conspiracy&quot;; one of Jean Renoir&#x27;s favorite actors, Marcel Dalio (&quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; and &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;), portrays a swindler who separately cheats Bret and Bart in &quot;Game of Chance&quot;; and Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s ocean-going adventure &quot;The Wrecker&quot; features Errol Flynn look-alike Patric Knowles in an episode with both Bret and Bart.

&quot;Pappy&quot; presents Garner portraying Bret and Bart&#x27;s colorful father, Beau Maverick, a previously unseen character. Bret and Bart would frequently announce, &quot;As my Pappy used to say...&quot; followed by aphorisms like, &quot;Work is fine for killing time but it&#x27;s a shaky way to make a living.&quot; Bret disguises himself as Pappy in the same episode, which features trick photography sequences with Garner playing both roles in the same shot. Kelly also plays a dual role, briefly portraying Beau&#x27;s brother Bentley (&quot;Uncle Bent&quot;, as Bret calls him). Garner&#x27;s Beau Maverick is not the same character as the Beau Maverick played by Roger Moore later in the series; Moore&#x27;s Beau is the nephew of Garner&#x27;s Beau, and Bret and Bart&#x27;s cousin. The younger Beau Maverick always referred to the elder as &quot;Uncle Beau&quot; or &quot;Uncle Beauregard&quot; instead of &quot;Pappy.&quot; Troy Donahue plays the son of a long-time lover of Pappy in the episode, and Adam West portrays a villain.

&quot;Bolt from the Blue&quot; starring Roger Moore as Beau Maverick was written and directed by Robert Altman. Other memorable solo episodes with Moore include &quot;Red Dog&quot; with Lee Van Cleef and John Carradine, and &quot;Kiz&quot; with Kathleen Crowley and Peggy McCay.

Jack Kelly&#x27;s favorite episode was &quot;Two Beggars On Horseback,&quot; a sweeping adventure that depicted a frenzied race between Bret and Bart to cash a check, the only time in the series that Kelly also wore a black hat, albeit briefly. Notable solo episodes with Kelly as Bart Maverick include &quot;The Jeweled Gun&quot; with Kathleen Crowley; &quot;The Third Rider&quot; with Dick Foran; the aforementioned &quot;The Savage Hills&quot; with Diane Brewster as Samantha Crawford; &quot;Iron Hand&quot; with Robert Redford in a major supporting role, his first screen acting appearance; the ominously suspenseful &quot;Last Stop: Oblivion&quot; with Buddy Ebsen; &quot;Betrayal&quot; with Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Crowley and Ruta Lee; and &quot;Substitute Gun&quot; with Coleen Gray and Joan Marshall. &quot;The Maverick Line,&quot; a post-Huggins episode, features the most screen time with Bret and Bart together as well as Buddy Ebsen as a comical stagecoach robber. The episode was shot in the third season but held back and not telecast until the middle of the following season, originally intended to be the first episode of the fourth season until Garner won his lawsuit against the studio and left the series.

Many episodes are humorous while others are deadly serious, and in addition to purely original scripts, producer Roy Huggins drew upon works by writers as disparate as Louis L&#x27;Amour (&quot;Stage West&quot;) and Robert Louis Stevenson (&quot;The Wrecker&quot;) to give the series breadth and scope. The various Mavericks never stopped traveling, and the show was as likely to be set on a riverboat or in New Orleans as in a Western desert or frontier saloon. Roy Huggins quit the series at the end of the second season due to a life-threatening bout with pneumonia, and was succeeded by writer/producer Coles Trapnell, ushering in a gradual but sharp permanent decline in ratings. The series had finished at No. 6 in the Nielsen ratings in the 1958–1959 second season (a coup since it was scheduled directly against and topped a roster of extremely popular series such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; and &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; on the other networks), then fell to No. 19 in the 1959–1960 third season and out of the top 30 during its last two seasons, after Garner had left the show.

==Spin-offs and crossovers==
In the decades following the cancellation of &quot;Maverick&quot;, the characters and situations have been revived several times.

===&quot;The New Maverick&quot; (1978)===
&quot;The New Maverick&quot; is a 1978 TV movie with James Garner and Jack Kelly reprising their roles, and Charles Frank playing young Ben Maverick, the son of their cousin Beau (Roger Moore, although Moore did not appear in &quot;The New Maverick&quot;). Garner shot the film while on hiatus from &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. Kelly only appears in a couple of scenes near the end, a frequent practice during Garner episodes in the original series.

===&quot;Young Maverick&quot; (1979)===
&quot;The New Maverick&quot; was the pilot for a new series, &quot;Young Maverick&quot;, which ran for a short time in 1979. Charles Frank&#x27;s character, Ben Maverick, was the focal point of the show, while James Garner only appeared as Bret for a few moments at the beginning of the first episode. It is apparent Bret does not much care for Ben, and the two part at the nearest crossroads. The series ended so quickly that some episodes that had already been filmed were never broadcast in the United States. Despite the title, Charles Frank was three years older than James Garner, Jack Kelly, Roger Moore or Robert Colbert had been when they started in the original series.

===&quot;Bret Maverick&quot; (1981)===
Two years later, Garner left &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; and began looking at possibilities for another series. &quot;Bret Maverick&quot; (1981–82) stars the 53-year-old as an older-but-no-wiser Bret, originally seen in the earlier series at age 29. Jack Kelly appears as Bret&#x27;s brother Bart in only one episode but was slated to return as a series regular for the following season, for which several scripts were already written and presented to Kelly during the filming of the season finale. NBC unexpectedly canceled the show after one season despite respectable ratings, and Kelly would never officially join the cast. The new series involves Bret Maverick settling down in a small town in Arizona after winning a saloon in a poker game; a large new supporting cast was introduced to take some of the burden off Garner, who had been in almost every scene of most of his original &quot;Maverick&quot; episodes as well as &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. The two-hour pilot episode was reedited as the TV movie &quot;Bret Maverick: The Lazy Ace&quot; and the series&#x27; only two-part episode was later marketed as a TV movie titled &quot;Bret Maverick: Faith, Hope and Clarity&quot;. &quot;Bret Maverick&quot; ends on a sentimental note, with Bret and Bart embracing during an unexpected encounter, with the theme from the original series playing in the background.

===&quot;The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw&quot; (1991)===
The TV movie &quot;The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw&quot; (1991) includes a cameo by Kelly as Bart Maverick along with other actors from various earlier Western television series, including Gene Barry as Bat Masterson, Hugh O&#x27;Brian as Wyatt Earp, Chuck Connors as the Rifleman, Johnny Crawford as his son Mark, David Carradine as Caine from &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, Brian Keith from &quot;The Westerner&quot;, James Drury and Doug McClure as a thinly disguised Virginian and Trampas, and Clint Walker as &quot;Cheyenne&quot; Bodie. As each hero appears onscreen, a few bars of the theme song from his original series plays in the background. The cameo was Jack Kelly&#x27;s last acting appearance: he died of a stroke at age 65 the following year.

==In other media==
===Cinema===

A lavish theatrical film version was released in 1994 entitled &quot;Maverick&quot; starring Mel Gibson as Bret Maverick, Jodie Foster as a faux-Southern accented gambler reminiscent of Samantha Crawford, and James Garner as Marshal Zane Cooper, who is later revealed to be Bret&#x27;s father. The film was directed by Richard Donner (who had previously directed many TV series prior to working in feature films) from a screenplay by Oscar-winning writer William Goldman (&quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;).

Garner maintained in later interviews that he was playing exactly the same character as in the television series, with Gibson as his son (which is consistent with the script&#x27;s and Gibson&#x27;s notably different interpretation of the character), but the screenplay itself leaves this open to conjecture; some assume that he was actually portraying Bret&#x27;s father Beau &quot;Pappy&quot; Maverick, whom he had originally played in the &quot;Maverick&quot; television series in a single episode.

A &quot;Making of&quot; mini-documentary was broadcast on cable stations prior to the film&#x27;s release that included no footage of Garner from the original series despite both the movie and television series having been produced by the same studio.

===Comic books===
During the height of the TV show&#x27;s popularity and beyond, the various Mavericks appeared in &quot;Maverick&quot; comic books drawn by Dan Spiegle. Spiegle met James Garner at the studio before the first &quot;Maverick&quot; comic was drawn because no publicity photographs were available yet; only Garner as Bret was featured in the first comic books because he was the only Maverick for the first seven television episodes. The encounter left a favorable impression and Spiegle thereafter put extra effort into his drawings of Garner to capture the likeness of the actor while his subsequent depictions of the other Mavericks (Jack Kelly as Bart, Roger Moore as Beau, and Robert Colbert as Brent—inaccurately referred to as &quot;Bret&quot; in the comic book version) bore comparatively little resemblance to the actual actors. Spiegle explained to an interviewer:
===Bret Maverick statue===
On April 21, 2006, a bronze statue of James Garner as Bret Maverick was unveiled in Garner&#x27;s hometown of Norman, Oklahoma, with Garner present. He noted in his memoir &quot;The Garner Files&quot; that it was one of the most enjoyable days of his life.

Two different books on the &quot;Maverick&quot; TV series were published in 1994, one by Burl Barer and the other by Ed Robertson, and serve as the main sources for the background information in this article, together with various magazine pieces from &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Life Magazine&quot;, and numerous others, along with viewings of the original series episodes, many of which remain available to the public at the Paley Center for Media in New York City and Los Angeles. The entire series was released on DVD one season at a time in 2012, 2013, and 2014, with the short thirteen-episode fifth season starring Jack Kelly in solo episodes available only upon demand (MOD: Manufacture On Demand); the fifth season was initially presented on air alternating with James Garner reruns from earlier seasons but the reruns are omitted from the DVD. Amazon Prime Video also offers the entire series on their online platform.

<doc id="380513" wikidata="Q7459210" url="?curid=380513" title="Seymour Melman">
<text>Seymour Melman (December 30, 1917 – December 16, 2004) was an American professor emeritus of industrial engineering and operations research at Columbia University&#x27;s Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.

He wrote extensively for fifty years on &quot;economic conversion&quot;, the ordered transition from military to civilian production by military industries and facilities. Author of &quot;The Permanent War Economy&quot; and &quot;Pentagon Capitalism&quot;, he was an economist, writer, and gadfly of the military-industrial complex.

== Biography ==

Seymour Melman was born in New York City on December 30, 1917. He studied at the De Witt Clinton High School in the Bronx and received his undergraduate degree from the City College of New York in 1939. After graduation he received a travel fellowship and traveled to Palestine and Europe between 1939 and 1940.

Upon returning to the United States he served for two years as the secretary of the Student Zionist Federation. Soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he served in the US Army as a First Lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps. Afterwards he served on the National Industrial Conference Board. He became a graduate student at Columbia University in January 1945 and received his Ph.D. in economics in June 1949. He joined the Columbia faculty that year and was a popular instructor until he retired from teaching in 2003.

Melman was the former President of the Association for Evolutionary Economics, Vice President of the New York Academy of Sciences, co-chair of SANE (Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy), chair of The National Commission for Economic Conversion and Disarmament, and a participant in the Reindustrialization of the United States Project.

In 1976 SANE&#x27;s New York City conference on &quot;The Arms Race and the Economic Crisis&quot; featured Melman, and won an economic conversion plank in the Democratic party platform.

Melman died in his Manhattan home of an aneurysm on December 16, 2004.

== Work ==
Melman was part of a circle of intellectuals with epicenters in various networks. He was associated with the Frame of Reference group led by University of Pennsylvania Professor Zellig Harris, which culminated in Harris&#x27;s posthumous book &quot;The transformation of capitalist society&quot;. He also fraternized with a group of scholars at Columbia University that included the sociologist Robert S. Lynd. And he was connected to a wide network of national and international scholars and activists concerned with disarmament, economic conversion and economic democracy, including Noam Chomsky, Marcus Raskin, Harley Shaiken, John Ullmann, Lloyd J. Dumas, and John Kenneth Galbraith, among many others.

He was also on the advisory board of FFIPP-USA (Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian Peace-USA), a network of Palestinian, Israeli, and International faculty, and students, working in for an end of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and a just peace.

The legacy of Seymour Melman&#x27;s work continues in a fellowship and research program supported by the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C. and through the work of his former colleagues in the Economic Reconstruction network.

===Quotations===
&quot;The joy of accomplishing production. It&#x27;s a great thing. The work I&#x27;ve been doing now for some time is writing an article, writing a book, or researching something. It&#x27;s an accomplishment. It&#x27;s a great thing. No, more exactly, it&#x27;s living. It&#x27;s being alive. To be productive is to be alive.&quot;

&quot;A bomb equivalent to 20 million tons of TNT would cause an intense fire called a &#x27;fire storm&#x27; in an area about around the area of the blast. And in such an area it would be futile, desperately futile to construct what are called &#x27;fallout shelters&#x27;&quot;.

<text>Laurie Skreslet (born October 25, 1949) is a Canadian mountaineer best known for his ascent of Mount Everest.

On October 5, 1982 at 9:30am local time, Skreslet became the first Canadian to reach the summit of Mount Everest, via the southeast col route. The 1982 Canadian Mount Everest Expedition (sponsored by Air Canada) had taken five years to plan, $3 million to finance and required 27 tons of equipment to outfit the party. The expedition also experienced tragedy when four climbers perished in the Khumbu Icefall during setup of Camp I.

==Biography==
Laurie Skreslet was raised as an only child in Calgary, Alberta. At the age of 16 he left home and 2 years later was introduced to mountain climbing in 1970. Within two years Skreslet became a member of a successful expedition to Peru’s highest mountain Huascaran. Over the years he became an expert in rock climbing, ice climbing, working in high altitudes, and Alpine climbing. As a result, he decided to become an instructor at Colorado and Canadian outward bound Mountain Schools.

==Expeditions==
Skreslet, a very strong mountain climber, went to climb in Nepal in 1982, reaching the summit of Mount Everest (29,028 ft. above sea level) in October of that year. In the fall of 1987 Skreslet attempted to climb the north face of Kanchenjunga (28,169 ft. above sea level) but didn’t quite accomplish it. Skreslet has led class expeditions to the Canadian Rockies, Nepal, South America and India. Other mountains Skreslet has climbed in his journey were in the North American Rockies, South American Andes and Asian Himalayas. Since his journey up Mt. Everest in 1982, he has returned five times. During his journey on Mt. Everest, the only injury he received was three broken ribs, even though other mountain climbers have died trying to climb the mountain.

<doc id="380517" wikidata="Q675520" url="?curid=380517" title="Maverick (film)">
<text>Maverick is a 1994 American Western comedy film directed by Richard Donner, and starring Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner. The screenplay by William Goldman, based on the 1957–1962 television series of the same name created by Roy Huggins and originally starring Garner, stars Gibson as Bret Maverick, a card player and con artist who collects money in order to enter a high-stakes poker game. He is joined in his adventure by Annabelle Bransford (Foster), another con artist, and Marshal Zane Cooper (Garner), a lawman. The supporting cast features Graham Greene, James Coburn, Alfred Molina and many cameo appearances by Western film actors, country music stars, and other actors.

&quot;Maverick&quot; was filmed from August to December 1993. Released theatrically by Warner Bros. on May 20, 1994, the film was both a critical and commercial success, grossing $183 million worldwide. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design.

==Plot==
In the American Old West, gambler Bret Maverick is on his way to a major five-card draw poker tournament being held on the paddle steamer &quot;Lauren Belle&quot;, intending to prove he is the best card player alive. Short $3,000 of the $25,000 tournament entry fee, Maverick travels to the town of Crystal River to collect on debts and accrue poker winnings. During one game, he encounters the ill-tempered gambler Angel and young con artist Annabelle Bransford. He wins a massive pot from Angel, but is forced to flee without his winnings.

Maverick and Bransford share a stagecoach with Marshal Zane Cooper, and together the three set out of Crystal River. They narrowly escape a fatal plunge into a ravine after their elderly driver suddenly dies, and later aid a group of missionary settlers who have been robbed by bandits disguised as Indians. The settlers offer Maverick a percentage of the recovered money they desperately need to start their mission, while one spinster missionary suggests marriage to Cooper, but both men turn down the offers. The trio and the settlers are then cornered by a large band of real Indians whose leader, Joseph, is an old friend of Maverick&#x27;s; however, no one else in the group is aware of this. Maverick feigns sacrificing himself to allow the others to escape, then tries to collect the $1,000 that Joseph owes him. The two swindle a Russian Archduke out of the needed amount with a scheme that &quot;allows&quot; him to hunt and kill an Indian (Maverick, in disguise).

Still seething over his loss in the Crystal River game, Angel receives a telegram instructing him to stop Maverick. Angel and his men catch Maverick and try to hang him, but he escapes after they have departed. Still $2,000 short, he makes his way to the &quot;Lauren Belle&quot; and finds Bransford, who is still $4,000 short herself. Spotting the Archduke aboard, Maverick poses as a Bureau of Indian Affairs agent investigating the shooting of Indians for game, conning the Archduke out of $6,000 to cover his and Bransford&#x27;s entry.

Commodore Duvall welcomes the competitors to the tournament, with Cooper overseeing the security of the game and the $500,000 prize money and watching for any cheaters, who will be summarily thrown overboard if discovered. Maverick, Angel, Bransford, and Duvall advance to the winner-take-all final. Prior to this game, Maverick and Bransford have a tryst in his quarters. After Bransford leaves, Maverick finds he has been locked in the room to try and make him forfeit the game, but he manages to climb outside the steamer to reach the table on time. After Bransford has been eliminated, Maverick notices that the dealer is engaging in bottom dealing and has Angel give him the top card from the deck in order to prevent further cheating. All three men bet their remaining chips; Angel and Duvall reveal strong hands, but Maverick has received the one card he needs to complete a royal flush. Angel and his men draw their weapons, but Cooper and Maverick shoot first, killing them.

During the closing ceremony, Cooper steals the prize money and escapes. Later that night, Cooper secretly meets with Duvall, revealing that the two had struck a deal to steal the money for themselves and that Angel was working for Duvall. As Duvall draws a gun and tries to break the deal, Maverick appears and takes back the money, having tracked them down. Some time later, Cooper corners Maverick while the latter is enjoying a hot bath; the two are revealed to be father and son who had planned the scheme long in advance. As both men relax in the baths, Bransford arrives, having discerned their relationship from their similar physiques and mannerisms. She takes the satchel containing the prize money and departs, after which Maverick reveals to Cooper that he had followed the latter&#x27;s advice and hidden half of it in his boots. He muses that retrieving the remaining $250,000 will be &quot;fun&quot;.

There are various cameo appearances in the film from Western actors, people who have formerly worked with Donner, Gibson, Foster, or Garner, and other celebrities including Danny Glover (uncredited), Hal Ketchum and Corey Feldman as bank robbers; Read Morgan and Steve Kahan as card dealers; Art LaFleur and Leo Gordon as poker players at Maverick&#x27;s first game; Paul Brinegar as the stagecoach driver; Denver Pyle as a cheating old gambler; Robert Fuller, Doug McClure, Henry Darrow, William Smith, Michael Paul Chan and Charles Dierkop as riverboat poker players; William Marshall as a riverboat poker player defeated by Angel; Dennis Fimple as Stuttering, a player beaten by the Commodore; Bert Remsen as an elderly riverboat gambler beaten by Maverick; and Margot Kidder as missionary Margaret Mary, colleague of missionary Mary Margaret, in an uncredited appearance. Additional cameos cut from the film included Alice Cooper as the town drunk, Linda Hunt as a magician and Clint Walker as a sheriff.

Leo Gordon had played a semi-regular supporting character in seasons one and two of the original &quot;Maverick&quot; TV show, gambler Big Mike McComb. Gordon also later wrote a few episodes of the show. Margot Kidder had been Garner&#x27;s co-star and onscreen love interest in the short-lived western TV series &quot;Nichols&quot;, reflected in their meeting in &quot;Maverick&quot; when her character quickly hints that his character might want to marry her. Danny Glover&#x27;s cameo appearance references Donner&#x27;s &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; film series starring Glover and Gibson as cop partners. Their meeting in &quot;Maverick&quot; sees them share a moment of recognition, complete with &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; music, and as he leaves, Glover says Roger Murtaugh&#x27;s catchphrase: &quot;I&#x27;m too old for this shit.&quot;

Various country music singers also cameo, including Carlene Carter as a waitress, Waylon Jennings and Kathy Mattea as a gambling couple with concealed guns, Reba McEntire as a spectator in the opening poker game, Clint Black as a sweet-faced gambler thrown overboard for cheating, and Vince Gill and his then-wife Janis Gill as spectators.

==Production==
===Development===
In &quot;Five Screenplays with Essays&quot;, Goldman describes an earlier version of the script, in which Maverick explains he has a magic ability to call the card he needs out of the deck. Although he is not able to do so successfully, the old hermit he attempts to demonstrate it for tells him that he really does have the magic in him. The scene was shot with Linda Hunt playing the hermit but it was felt it did not work in the context of the rest of the movie and was cut.

Garner wrote in his memoirs that Richard Donner originally wanted Paul Newman to play Zane Cooper but Newman was not interested.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on August 16, 1993 and concluded on December 10. Parts of the film were shot at Lake Powell and Warm Creek in Utah. Other filming locations include Lee&#x27;s Ferry and Marble Canyon in Arizona, Lone Pine, Manzanar, Big Pine, and Yosemite National Park in California, and Columbia River Gorge in Oregon.

===Vehicles===

The steamboat used in the film—dubbed the &quot;Lauren Belle&quot;—was the &quot;Portland&quot;, the last remaining sternwheel tugboat in the United States. At the time, it belonged to the Oregon Maritime Museum in Portland. Over several weeks, the boat was decorated to alter its appearance to resemble a Mississippi-style gambling boat, including the addition of two decorative chimneys. In August 1993, the production requested permission to film scenes of the riverboat along the Columbia River in Washington State. The artificial smoke released by the boat&#x27;s chimney was considered to violate air-quality laws in Washington and Oregon and required approval for the scenes before their scheduled filming date in September 1993. After filming concluded, the decorations were removed and the boat was returned to its original state.

===Soundtrack===
The soundtrack featured three chart singles: &quot;Renegades, Rebels and Rogues&quot; by Tracy Lawrence, &quot;A Good Run of Bad Luck&quot; by Clint Black (which also appeared on his album &quot;No Time to Kill&quot;), and &quot;Something Already Gone&quot; by Carlene Carter. Also included on the album was an all-star rendition of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, from which all royalties were donated to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Maverick&quot; earned $101,631,272 (55.5%) in North America and $81,400,000 (44.5%) elsewhere for a worldwide total of $183,031,272. This made it the 12th highest-grossing film in North America and the 15th highest-grossing film worldwide of 1994. As of 2013, the film is the sixth highest grossing Western film in North America.

Pre-release tracking showed that the film would open strongly. During its opening weekend in North America, &quot;Maverick&quot; earned $17.2 million from 2,537 theaters – an average of $6,798 per theater – ranking as the number 1 film of the weekend, and took a total of $41.8 million over its first two weeks of release.

===Critical response===
&quot;Maverick&quot; has received generally favorable reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 68% rating based on reviews from 56 critics, with an average rating of 6/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;It isn&#x27;t terribly deep, but it&#x27;s witty and undeniably charming, and the cast is obviously having fun.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 62% based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A− on scale of A to F.

James Berardinelli, from reelviews.net, gave the film three and a half stars out of four. He stated, &quot;The strength of &quot;Maverick&quot; is the ease with which it switches from comedy to action, and back again...it&#x27;s refreshing to find something that satisfies expectations.&quot; Reviewing it for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing that the film is &quot;the first lighthearted, laugh-oriented family Western in a long time, and one of the nice things about it is, it doesn&#x27;t feel the need to justify its existence. It acts like it&#x27;s the most natural thing in the world to be a Western.&quot;

==Other media==
In September 1994, Data East pinball released a pinball machine based on the film. The backglass featured the likeness of Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and other stars of the film. The game was the last to be released under the Data East name, with the company being sold to Sega and rebranded as Sega Pinball later that year.

<text>ThinkGeek was an American retailer that catered to computer enthusiasts and &quot;geek culture&quot;. Described as a &quot;Sharper Image for sysadmins&quot;, their merchandise has been likened to &quot;toys for adults, novelties designed to appeal to both your inner child and your inner grad student.&quot; These include clothing, electronic and scientific gadgets, unusual computer peripherals, office toys, pet toys, child toys, and caffeinated drinks and candy. ThinkGeek was founded in 1999 and was based in Fairfax, Virginia. The brand is currently owned by Geeknet, a subsidiary of GameStop.

==History==
ThinkGeek was founded in 1999, and originally based in downtown McLean, Virginia. The company was founded by Jen Frazier, Jon Sime, Scott Smith, and Willie Vadnais, all of whom were running a small Internet startup at the time, with ThinkGeek initially starting as a side project. The website&#x27;s official launch date was August 13, 1999. Andover.net, a Boston area technology news publisher, acquired ThinkGeek in October 1999. Only a few months later Andover.net was acquired by VA Linux, a California-based tech company that specialized in Linux hardware and software products. VA Linux, after several name changes, became Geeknet.

In August 2000, the company moved its offices to Fairfax, Virginia. ThinkGeek grew steadily and increased the number of employees from six in 2004 up to 83 in 2013. Company revenues also increased during this time period, reaching $50 million in sales in 2009 and $118.9 million in 2012. In 2012, ThinkGeek was ranked as one of the top online retailers, listing as #175 on the Internet Retailer Top 500 List.

ThinkGeek&#x27;s mascot was a monkey named Timmy.
On May 26, 2015, it was announced that pop culture-oriented retailer Hot Topic had made an offer to acquire Geeknet and ThinkGeek for $17.50 per-share, valuing the company at $122 million. However, on May 29, 2015, it was revealed that an unspecified company had made a counter-offer of $20 per-share; Hot Topic was given until June 1, 2015 to exceed this new offer. On June 2, 2015, it was announced that video game retail chain GameStop had acquired Geeknet for $140 million. The deal was completed on July 17, 2015.

On September 25, 2015, ThinkGeek opened its first retail store at The Florida Mall in Orlando, Florida. In 2016, ThinkGeek opened 25 more physical stores in the U.S., along with 25 international stores. The retailer said they were &quot;committed to creating a seamless omnichannel experience for its customers&quot;, including store pickups and ship-to-store options.

In June 2019, ThinkGeek announced that it would be discontinuing its online store, and integrating its e-commerce operations into a &quot;curated selection&quot; of GameStop&#x27;s online operations. New product details from after the standalone site closed were made public in January 2020, including Jigglypuff and Get Schwifty (from &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;) themed Bluetooth Speakers.

The Miami location closed in January 2021. In July 2021, the North Star Mall location in San Antonio, Texas closed. In August 2021, the Austin, Texas; El Paso, Texas; McAllen, Texas; and Tacoma, Washington locations announced on social media that they would be closing on September 26, 2021. 

==Products==
After its acquisition by GameStop, most of ThinkGeek&#x27;s merchandise was licensed from various science fiction and fantasy media franchises such as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Firefly&quot;, Marvel Comics, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Minecraft&quot;, and &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. Other products offered by the company include classic pop cultural icons like the Magic 8 Ball, or products inspired by science, such as a Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat Executive Decision Maker. Prior to the acquisition, ThinkGeek curated a collection of many unique products, especially for the time; such as Miracleberry tablets, a t-shirt with integrated sound effects, and virtual keyboards, well before other retailers stocked such items.

ThinkGeek was known for its April Fool&#x27;s Day gags, wherein the site would post a series of fictional, unconventional products referencing popular culture, such as the &quot;Banksy Toaster&quot; (which burns pictures of Banksy artwork into toast), &quot;Where&#x27;s Barb?&quot; (a &quot;Stranger Things&quot;-themed parody of &quot;Where&#x27;s Waldo?&quot;), &quot;Nerf Nuke&quot;, and the &quot;Thor Mighty Mjolnir Mailbox&quot;. Some of the more popular items, however, were made into actual products, such as &quot;Canned Unicorn Meat&quot;, the cecaelia-themed &quot;Tentacuddle Blanket&quot;, the Tauntaun sleeping bag, and the &quot;Technomancer Hoodie&quot;.

ThinkGeek ran a points-for-reward system called &quot;Geek Points&quot;, under which customers could earn rewards for buying more products.

<doc id="380528" wikidata="Q16191884" url="?curid=380528" title="Neo-Grec">
<text>Néo-Grec was a Neoclassical Revival style of the mid-to-late 19th century that was popularized in architecture, the decorative arts, and in painting during France&#x27;s Second Empire, the reign of Napoleon III (1852–1870). The Néo-Grec vogue took as its starting point the earlier expressions of the Neoclassical style inspired by 18th-century excavations at Pompeii, which resumed in earnest in 1848, and similar excavations at Herculaneum. The style mixed elements of the Graeco-Roman, Pompeian, Adam and Egyptian Revival styles into &quot;a richly eclectic polychrome mélange.&quot; &quot;The style enjoyed a vogue in the United States, and had a short-lived impact on interior design in England and elsewhere.&quot;

==Architecture==

In architecture, the Néo-Grec is not always clearly distinguishable from the Neoclassical designs of the earlier part of the century, in buildings such as the Church of the Madeleine, Paris. The classic example of Néo-Grec architecture is Henri Labrouste&#x27;s innovative Bibliothèque Sainte Genevieve in Paris, 1843–50, generally seen as the first major public building in this later mode of classicism.

Not only was the Néo-Grec popular in France, but also in Victorian England and especially in the United States, where its severity accorded with the American Renaissance. The architectural historian Neil Levine has explained the style as a reaction against the rigidity of Classicism. According to Levine, Néo-Grec was a somewhat looser style, which &quot;replaced the rhetorical form of classical architectural discourse by a more literal and descriptive syntax of form.&quot; It was meant to be a &quot;readable&quot; architecture.

American architect Richard Morris Hunt introduced Néo-Grec massing into his buildings in the late 1860s and 1870s. Hunt&#x27;s student, Frank Furness, did the same in his early Philadelphia buildings, and experimented with using massing and visual &quot;weight&quot; for dramatic effect.
==Decorative arts==
In the decorative arts, Neo-Grec was based on the standard repertory of Greco-Roman ornament, combining motifs drawn from Greek vase-painting and repetitive architectural motifs like anthemions, palmettes, Greek key with elements from the Adam and Louis XVI styles of early Neoclassicism (c. 1765–1790), and of Napoleonic-era Egyptian Revival decorative arts; it can be identified by the frequent use of isolated motifs of Classical heads and figures, masks, winged griffins, sea-serpents, urns, medallions, arabesques and lotus buds confined within panels, shaped reserves or multiple borders of anthemion, guilloche, and Greek fret pattern. Neo-Grec was eclectic, abstracted, polychromatic, and sometimes bizarre. Its treatment was intentionally dry and linear. Its vignettes and repeating patterns lent themselves to stencilling. Typical &quot;Neo-Grec&quot; color harmonies were rich and harsh: black motifs and outlines against &quot;Pompeian&quot; red, powder blue and puce, bistre and olive drab might be combined in a single decor. The style maintained its supremacy briefly before other fashions came to the top in France.
===In the United States===
Frank Furness and furniture maker Daniel Pabst created Neo-Grec furniture for the city house of liquor baron Henry C. Gibson, circa 1870, and for the library of the architect&#x27;s brother, Horace Howard Furness, circa 1871. They created paneling and furniture for the Manhattan city house of Theodore Roosevelt Sr., circa 1873. Pabst&#x27;s Modern Gothic exhibition cabinet (circa 1877-80), now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, mixed Gothic detailing and exaggerated Corinthian capitals.
==Painting==

In painting, the Neoclassical style continued to be taught in the Académie des Beaux-Arts, inculcating crisp outlines, pellucid atmosphere, and a clear, clean palette. However, a formal Neo-Grec group of artists was created in the mid 19th century after growing interest in Ancient Greece and Rome, and especially the later excavations at Pompeii. The Paris Salon of 1847, revealed the academic painter Jean-Léon Gérôme, who in &quot;The Cock Fight&quot; depicted a composition in which, in a scene of antiquity, a young boy and a girl attend the combat of two cocks. Gérôme gained fame from this exhibition, and in the next year formed the Neo-Grec group with Jean-Louis Hamon and Henri-Pierre Picou—all three pupils in the same &quot;atelier&quot; under Charles Gleyre.

Gleyre himself adopted the tenets of neo-classicism more strictly than others at the time, adopting the classical style and aesthetic, but almost exclusively applying it to myths and motifs from antiquity, recalling both characters from Greek myth, and antique emblems such as bacchantes and putti. The Neo-Grec group took Gleyre&#x27;s style and interests, but adapted it from use in history painting as in Gleyre&#x27;s work, into genre painting. Because they were inspired by discoveries at Pompeii, they were also called &quot;néo-pompéiens&quot;.

Louis Hector Leroux was also identified as a Neo-Grec.

The paintings of the Neo-Grecs sought to capture everyday, anecdotal trivialities of ancient Greek life, in a manner of whimsy, grace, and charm, and were often realistic, sensual, and erotic. For this reason they were also called &quot;anacreontic&quot; after the Greek poet Anacreon, who wrote sprightly verses in praise of love and wine. Alfred de Tanouarn describes one of Hamon&#x27;s paintings as &quot;clear, simple and natural, the idea, the attitudes and the aspects. It leads the lips a soft smile; it causes us an inexpressible feeling of pleasure in which one is happy to stop and view the painting&quot;. It can perhaps be said the motto of this group was &quot;the goal of art is to charm&quot;. Most Neo-Grec paintings were also done in a horizontal layout as in a frieze decoration or Greek vases, with the composition simplified.

The Neo-Grec school was criticized in many respects; for its attention to historical detail it was said by Charles Baudelaire &quot;the scholarship is to disguise the absence of imagination&quot;, and the subject matter was considered by many as trivial. The painters were also charged with selectively adopting the ancient Greek style, in that they left out noble themes and only focused on trivial daily life—leading to the accusation that they were creating art that supported the ideologies of the &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;, or comfortable middle class.

The discovery in Pompeii also inspired history paintings based on the event, not necessarily strictly in a Neo-Grec style, such as &quot;The Last Day of Pompeii&quot; by Karl Briullov.

==Music==
The Neo-Grec vogue even made its way into French music through the works of the composer Erik Satie in a series of pieces called &quot;Gymnopédies&quot; – the title is a reference to dances performed by the youths of ancient Sparta in honour of Diana and Apollo at ceremonies commemorating the dead of the Battle of Thyrea. Their archaic melodies float above a modally oriented harmonic basis. The melodies of the &quot;Gnossiennes&quot; go further in this direction; they use ancient Greek chromatic mode (A–G flat–F–E–D flat–C–B–A) and an arabesque ornamentation.

<text>Biogen Inc. is an American multinational biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States specializing in the discovery, development, and delivery of the treatment of neurological diseases to patients worldwide. Biogen operates in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland.

== History ==
Biogen was founded in 1978 in Geneva as &quot;Biotechnology Geneva&quot; by several prominent biologists, including Kenneth Murray from the University of Edinburgh, Phillip Allen Sharp from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Walter Gilbert from Harvard University (Gilbert served as CEO during the start-up phase of Biogen), Heinz Schaller from the University of Heidelberg, and Charles Weissmann from the University of Zurich (Weissmann contributed the first product interferon alpha). Gilbert and Sharp were subsequently honored with Nobel Prizes: Gilbert was recognized in 1980 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his understanding of DNA sequencing and Sharp received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993 for his discovery of split genes.

In 2003, Biogen merged with San Diego, California-based IDEC Pharmaceuticals (formed in 1985 by University of California-San Diego&#x27;s physicians and immunologists Ivor Royston and Robert E. Sobol, San Diego bio entrepreneur Howard Birndorf, and Stanford University cancer researchers Ron Levy and Richard Miller) and adopted the name Biogen Idec. After the merger, Biogen Idec became the 3rd largest Biotechnology company in the world.

Following shifts in research core areas, the company has since shortened its name, reverting to simply Biogen. Biogen stock is a component of several stock indices such as the S&amp;P 500, S&amp;P 1500, and NASDAQ-100 and the company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol, BIIB.

In May 2006, the company announced it would acquire cancer specialist, Conforma Therapeutics for $250 million. Later in the same month, the company announced its intention to acquire Fumapharm AG, consolidating ownership of Fumaderm and BG-12, an oral fumarate, which was being studied for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis.

In January 2007, the company announced it would acquire Syntonix Pharmaceuticals for up to $120 million, gaining Syntonix&#x27;s lead product for hemophilia B as well as the technology for developing inhalable treatments.

In 2008, two new brain infection cases from Tysabri users surfaced in Europe that raised international concern about Tysabri and its effects with the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) brain condition. Biogen is one of the drug&#x27;s producers.

In 2011, Biogen announced that its drug Fampyra received conditional marketing approval. Under the conditional approval, Biogen agrees to provide additional data on the long-term benefits and safety of Fampyra.

On December 10, 2012, Biogen announced its global collaboration agreement with Isis Pharmaceuticals to develop and research antisense drugs to treat neurological and neuromuscular diseases.

In February 2013, Bloomberg broke the news that Biogen was planning to pay Elan $3.25 billion for the full rights to Tysabri, used to treat multiple sclerosis.

In 2013, Biogen was the first U.S.-based biotechnology company to appear on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.

In January 2015, the company announced that it would acquire Convergence Pharmaceuticals for up to $675 million, with the acquisition aiming to accelerate the development of Convergence&#x27;s pipeline, in particular CNV1014802 – a Phase II small molecule sodium channel blocking candidate. In October 2015, the company announced that it would lay off 11% of its workforce, effective immediately.

On May 3, 2016, Biogen announced to spin off its hemophilia business, known as Bioverativ. The hemophilia business would become an independent publicly traded company. Bioverativ offered two hemophilia drugs in 2016, Alprolix and Eloctate, and plans on developing its Hemophilia-focused goals.

In 2016, Biogen released Spinraza (nusinersin), a treatment for Spinal Muscular Atrophy. The drug is among the most expensive treatments available, with a price of $750,000 for the first year of doses, and $375,000 for each subsequent year and likely for the rest of a patient&#x27;s life. While there still isn&#x27;t a cure, Spinraza significantly improves the quality of life in infants and adults.

In 2017, Biogen announced that its drug Fampyra converted from conditional marketing authorization to standard marketing approval. EU multiple sclerosis (MS) patients use Fampyra to improve walking.

In February 2020, Biogen and Sangamo Therapeutics announced a global licensing deal to develop compounds for neuromuscular and neurological diseases.

In September 2020, Biogen Inc. made a $10 million deposit in OneUnited Bank to provide more capital to fund home loans and commercial development in Black communities. In November, the company announced it would acquire a $650 million stake in Cambridge-based Sage Therapeutics and make an upfront payment of $875 million, in order to jointly develop a number of depression treatments.

In July 2023, it was announced Biogen had acquired the Plano, Texas-headquartered biotech company, Reata Pharmaceuticals for nearly $6.5 billion.

In May 2024, Biogen acquired Human Immunology Biosciences (HI-Bio) for $1.15 billion.

=== Aducanumab ===

In 2007, the company reached a licensing agreement with Neurimmune, a spin-off from the University of Zurich, for the Alzheimer&#x27;s disease drug, Aducanumab, developed by this Swiss company. Later, Neurimmune sold its rights for license fees for $200 million to Biogen.

In December 2014, Biogen announced that Aducanumab for Alzheimer&#x27;s treatment was preparing to go through a late-stage trial of its experimental Alzheimer&#x27;s disease treatment after the medication dramatically improved cognition and reduced brain plaque levels in early-stage study.

In March 2015, Aducanumab became the first experimental Alzheimer&#x27;s treatment to show significant results in regard to slowing down cognitive decline and reducing brain-destroying plaques. In July 2015, Biogen initiated two late-stage studies called ENGAGE and EMERGE, which will assess Aducanumab in adults with early Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

In 2016, Aducanumab decreased amoyloid-beta in the brains of people with early-stage Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, according to a report published in Nature on August 31, 2016. On March 21, 2019, Biogen announced that the Phase 3 clinical trials of Aducanumab were halted. Biogen announced it would acquire Nightstar Therapeutics for $25.50 per share ($800 million in total). Nightstar focused on adeno-associated virus based gene-therapies for inherited retinal disorders. With a setback in their drug research, Biogen&#x27;s shares fell sharply that same month. It ended the trial of Aducanumab, which it was making along with Eisai. In October 2019, however, they announced that they would pursue FDA approval together with Eisai.

On October 22, 2019, despite two Phase 3 clinical trials being previously halted for futility, Biogen announced its plan to submit for FDA&#x27;s approval of Aducanumab. In May 2020, Biogen wrapped up construction on a state-of-the-art facility in Solothurn, Switzerland, which will produce Aducanumab by late 2021, alongside its North Carolina manufacturing facility. The monoclonal antibody, co-developed with Eisai, attracted considerable interest from biotech investors when Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway bought 648,447 Biogen shares at a combined value of $192.4 million.

On July 8, 2020, Biogen and Eisai announced that both companies had together successfully submitted for Aducanumab&#x27;s FDA regulatory and marketing approval.

On June 7, 2021, the FDA gave accelerated approval to Aducanumab under the name Aduhelm, which proved to be controversial. The drug was priced at $56,000 US dollars per year, but it was not covered by many insurers as they awaited further proof that the drug was effective. The US Government did not subsidise it outside clinical trials. According to the FDA&#x27;s website, the drug was proven to reduce amyloid-beta plaques in the brain, which was likely to benefit patients. The FDA has stated that if the post-approval trial did not indicate that Aduhelm works, the drug may be taken out of the market.

Biogen abandoned the drug in January 2024, for financial reasons.

===Bioverativ===
In May 2016, the company announced that it would spin off its hemophilia drug business (Eloctate and Alprolix) into a public company. In August, the company announced that the spun off company would be called Bioverativ, in order to show heritage with Biogen. The company would trade on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol BIVV and would look to be spun off in early 2017. Bioverativ was acquired by Sanofi in 2018 for about $11.6 billions ($105 per share in cash).

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

On March 5, 2020, Biogen reported that three individuals who met with their employees at a conference in Boston had tested positive for COVID-19 the previous week. On March 6, public health officials reported five new cases associated with the Biogen leadership meeting and by March 9, Massachusetts health officials had announced 30 new presumptive COVID-19 cases, all connected to the Biogen conference. Researchers first estimated that the conference would be linked to over 20,000 of the state&#x27;s coronavirus cases. Researchers later estimated that up to 300,000 cases worldwide had been caused by the Biogen conference, including 1.6% of all U.S. cases of the coronavirus.

== Finances ==
For the fiscal year 2017, Biogen reported earnings of US$2.539 billion, with an annual revenue of US$12.274 billion, an increase of 7.2% over the previous fiscal cycle. Biogen&#x27;s shares traded at over $289 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$63 billion in November 2018. The company ranked 228 on the 2021 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.

Biogen focused its R&amp;D efforts on the discovery and development of treatments for patients with high unmet medical needs in the areas of neurology, hematology, and immunology.

Investigational MS medicines:
* Daclizumab High-Yield Process (DAC HYP): is being developed as a potential once-monthly subcutaneous injection in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). DAC HYP is being developed in collaboration with Abbvie, Inc. In June 2014, the companies announced positive top-line results from the Phase III DECIDE clinical trial, where DAC HYP demonstrated superiority over interferon beta-1a in annualized relapse rate.
* Anti-LINGO-1 (BIIB033) (Opicinumab): is the first candidate being investigated for its potential to remyelinate and repair neurons damaged by MS, currently in Phase 2 trials.

Biogen has several candidates in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in neurodegenerative and immunological diseases including MS, neuropathic pain, spinal muscular atrophy and lupus nephritis:
* Phase 2a: anti-LINGO-1 molecule (Opicinumab) in acute optic neuritis
* Phase 2b: anti-TWEAK monoclonal antibody in lupus nephritis
* Phase 2a: STX-100 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
* Phase 2: Neublastin for neuropathic pain in 2013
* Phase 1/2: BIIB067 (ISIS-SOD1Rx) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in collaboration with Ionis

Biogen also has several development agreements in place with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to collaborate to leverage antisense technology in advancing the treatment of neurological disorders.

In February 2012, Biogen formalized a joint venture with Samsung, creating Samsung Bioepis. This joint venture brings Biogen&#x27;s expertise and capabilities in protein engineering, cell line development, and recombinant biologics manufacturing to position the joint venture so Biogen can participate in the emerging market for biosimilars.

In early 2014, Biogen entered into an agreement with Eisai, Inc., to jointly develop and commercialize two of their candidates for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which have the potential to reduce Aβ plaques that form in the brains of patients, as well as to slow the formation of new plaques, potentially improving symptoms and suppressing disease progression.

Biogen also has since 2015 an agreement with AGTC to develop gene therapy for several genetic diseases, including X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) and X-linked Retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) ophthalmologic diseases. To this aim, Biogen paid AGTC $124 million, including an equity investment of $30 million, and up to 1,1 billion in future milestones.

In March 2019, Biogen halted Phase 3 trials of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease drug Aducanumab after &quot;an independent group&#x27;s analysis show[ed] that the trials were unlikely to &#x27;meet their primary endpoint.&#x27;&quot; However, in October 2019 they reversed their plans and said that they would be pursuing US FDA approval for Aducanumab. The reversal came after Biogen said a new analysis of a larger patient pool showed promising results. In July 2020, Biogen completed submission of a Biologics license application (BLA) to the FDA for review, and requested accelerated review. However, an advisory panel for the FDA voted against approval of this drug. On June 7, 2021, the FDA granted approval of Aducanumab for the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Aducanumab was approved using the accelerated approval pathway, and Biogen will be required to conduct a post-approval clinical trial to verify clinical benefit for continued approval.

==Lawsuits==
In September 2022, Biogen agreed to pay $900 million to the U.S. federal governments, states, and a whistleblower. Biogen had bribed doctors between 2009 and 2014 to increase prescriptions of Avonex, Tysabri, and Tecfidera (all for multiple sclerosis).

<doc id="380533" wikidata="Q1430528" url="?curid=380533" title="Macintosh IIsi">
<text>The Macintosh IIsi is a personal computer designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from October 1990 to March 1993. Introduced as a lower-cost alternative to the other Macintosh II family of desktop models, it was popular for home use, as it offered more expandability and performance than the Macintosh LC, which was introduced at the same time. Like the LC, it has built-in sound support, as well as support for color displays, with a maximum screen resolution of 640 × 480 in 8-bit color.

The IIsi remained on the market for two and a half years and was discontinued shortly after the introduction of its replacement, the Centris 610.

== Hardware ==
The IIsi&#x27;s case design is a compact desktop unit not used for any other Macintosh model, one of the few Macintosh designs that was used for a single model. Positioned below the Macintosh IIci as Apple&#x27;s entry-level professional model, the IIsi&#x27;s price was lowered by the redesign of the motherboard substituting a different memory controller and the deletion of all but one of the expansion card slots (a single Processor Direct Slot) and removal of the level 2 cache slot. 

It shipped with either a 40 MB or 80 MB internal hard disk, and a 1.44 MB floppy disk drive. The Motorola 68882 FPU was an optional upgrade, mounted on a special plug-in card. Ports included SCSI, two serial ports, an ADB port, a floppy drive port, and 3.5mm stereo headphone sound output and microphone sound input sockets.

A bridge card was available for the IIsi to convert the Processor Direct slot to a standard internal NuBus card slot, compatible with other machines in the Macintosh II family. The bridge card included the 68882 FPU to improve floating-point performance. The NuBus card was mounted horizontally above the motherboard.

To cut costs, the IIsi&#x27;s video shared the main system memory, which also had the effect of slowing down video considerably, especially as the IIsi had 1 MB of slow RAM soldered to the motherboard. David Pogue&#x27;s book &quot;Macworld Macintosh Secrets&quot; observed that one could speed up video considerably if one set the disk cache size large enough to force the computer to draw video RAM from the faster RAM installed in the SIMM banks.

The IIsi also suffers from sound difficulties: over time, the speaker contacts can fail, causing the sound to periodically drop out. This problem was caused by the very modular construction of the computer, where the mono loudspeaker is on a daughterboard under the motherboard, with springy contacts. Speaker vibrations led to fretting of the touching surfaces. The problem could be solved by removing the motherboard and using a pencil eraser to clean the contacts of the daughterboard holding the loudspeaker. As the IIsi is the only Macintosh to use this case design, these issues were never corrected in a subsequent model. The IIsi was designed to be easily and cheaply manufactured, such that no tools were required to put one together – everything is held in place with clips or latches.

Because of its heritage as a cut-down IIci, it was a simple modification to substitute a new clock crystal to increase the system&#x27;s clock rate to 25 MHz for a slight increase in performance and a large increase in video rendering speed.

== Known users ==
Charles Bukowski was an enthusiastic user of the IIsi.

<text>Scsh (a &quot;Scheme shell&quot;) is computer software, a type of shell for an operating system. It is a Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) application programming interface (API) layered on the programming language Scheme, in a manner to make the most of Scheme&#x27;s ability for scripting. Scsh is limited to 32-bit platforms but there is a development version against the latest Scheme 48 that works in 64-bit mode. It is free and open-source software released under the BSD-3-Clause license.

==Features==
Scsh includes these notable features:
* Library support for list, character, and string manipulations;
* Regular expressions manipulation support using &quot;scheme regular expressions&quot;, a domain-specific language (DSL), or little languages, approach to the abilities;
* Strong networking support;
* High-level support for awk like scripts, integrated into the language as macros;
* Abstractions supporting pseudo terminals;
* A shell language, modeled using quasi-quotation.

==Example==
* Print a list of all the executables available in the current PATH to the standard output:
#!/usr/local/bin/scsh -s

(define (executables dir)
 (with-cwd dir
 (filter file-executable? (directory-files dir #t))))
(define (writeln x) (display x) (newline))

(for-each writeln
 (append-map executables ((infix-splitter &quot;:&quot;) (getenv &quot;PATH&quot;))))
==&quot;Acknowledgments&quot;==
The reference manual for Scsh includes a spoof Acknowledgments section written by Olin Shivers. It starts:
:&quot;Who should I thank? My so-called &quot;colleagues&quot;, who laugh at me behind my back, all the while becoming famous on my work? My worthless graduate students, whose computer skills appear to be limited to downloading bitmaps off of netnews? My parents, who are still waiting for me to quit &quot;fooling around with computers,&quot; go to med school, and become a radiologist? My department chairman, a manager who gives one new insight into and sympathy for disgruntled postal workers?&quot;
and concludes with:
:&quot;Oh, yes, the acknowledgements. I think not. I did it. I did it all, by myself.&quot;

<doc id="380541" wikidata="Q1048687" url="?curid=380541" title="Skeletal muscle">
<text>Skeletal muscle (commonly referred to as muscle) is one of the three types of vertebrate muscle tissue, the others being cardiac muscle and smooth muscle. They are part of the voluntary muscular system and typically are attached by tendons to bones of a skeleton. The skeletal muscle cells are much longer than in the other types of muscle tissue, and are also known as &quot;muscle fibers&quot;. The tissue of a skeletal muscle is striated – having a striped appearance due to the arrangement of the sarcomeres.

A skeletal muscle contains multiple fascicles – bundles of muscle fibers. Each individual fiber and each muscle is surrounded by a type of connective tissue layer of fascia. Muscle fibers are formed from the fusion of developmental myoblasts in a process known as myogenesis resulting in long multinucleated cells. In these cells, the nuclei, termed &quot;myonuclei&quot;, are located along the inside of the cell membrane. Muscle fibers also have multiple mitochondria to meet energy needs.

Muscle fibers are in turn composed of myofibrils. The myofibrils are composed of actin and myosin filaments called myofilaments, repeated in units called sarcomeres, which are the basic functional, contractile units of the muscle fiber necessary for muscle contraction. Muscles are predominantly powered by the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates, but anaerobic chemical reactions are also used, particularly by fast twitch fibers. These chemical reactions produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules that are used to power the movement of the myosin heads.

Skeletal muscle comprises about 35% of the body of humans by weight. The functions of skeletal muscle include producing movement, maintaining body posture, controlling body temperature, and stabilizing joints. Skeletal muscle is also an endocrine organ. Under different physiological conditions, subsets of 654 different proteins as well as lipids, amino acids, metabolites and small RNAs are found in the secretome of skeletal muscles.

Skeletal muscles are substantially composed of multinucleated contractile muscle fibers (myocytes). However, considerable numbers of resident and infiltrating mononuclear cells are also present in skeletal muscles. In terms of volume, myocytes make up the great majority of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle myocytes are usually very large, being about 2–3 cm long and 100 μm in diameter. By comparison, the mononuclear cells in muscles are much smaller. Some of the mononuclear cells in muscles are endothelial cells (which are about 50–70 μm long, 10–30 μm wide and 0.1–10 μm thick), macrophages (21 μm in diameter) and neutrophils (12-15 μm in diameter). However, in terms of nuclei present in skeletal muscle, myocyte nuclei may be only half of the nuclei present, while nuclei from resident and infiltrating mononuclear cells make up the other half.

Considerable research on skeletal muscle is focused on the muscle fiber cells, the myocytes, as discussed in detail in the first sections, below. Recently, interest has also focused on the different types of mononuclear cells of skeletal muscle, as well as on the endocrine functions of muscle, described subsequently, below.

==Structure==
===Gross anatomy===

There are more than 600 skeletal muscles in the human body, making up around 40% of body weight in healthy young adults. In Western populations, men have on average around 61% more skeletal muscle than women. Most muscles occur in bilaterally-placed pairs to serve both sides of the body. Muscles are often classed as groups of muscles that work together to carry out an action. In the torso there are several major muscle groups including the pectoral, and abdominal muscles; intrinsic and extrinsic muscles are subdivisions of muscle groups in the hand, foot, tongue, and extraocular muscles of the eye. Muscles are also grouped into compartments including four groups in the arm,
and the four groups in the leg.

Apart from the contractile part of a muscle consisting of its fibers, a muscle contains a non-contractile part of dense fibrous connective tissue that makes up the tendon at each end. The tendons attach the muscles to bones to give skeletal movement. The length of a muscle includes the tendons. Connective tissue is present in all muscles as deep fascia. Deep fascia specialises within muscles to enclose each muscle fiber as endomysium; each muscle fascicle as perimysium, and each individual muscle as epimysium. Together these layers are called &quot;mysia&quot;. Deep fascia also separates the groups of muscles into muscle compartments.

Two types of sensory receptors found in muscles are muscle spindles, and Golgi tendon organs. Muscle spindles are stretch receptors located in the muscle belly. Golgi tendon organs are proprioceptors located at the myotendinous junction that inform of a muscle&#x27;s tension.

====Skeletal muscle cells====
Skeletal muscle cells are the individual contractile cells within a muscle, and are often termed as muscle fibers. A single muscle such as the biceps in a young adult male contains around 253,000 muscle fibers.

Skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated with the nuclei often referred to as myonuclei. This occurs during myogenesis with the fusion of myoblasts each contributing a nucleus. Fusion depends on muscle-specific proteins known as fusogens called &quot;myomaker&quot; and &quot;myomerger&quot;.

Many nuclei are needed by the skeletal muscle cell for the large amounts of proteins and enzymes needed to be produced for the cell&#x27;s normal functioning. A single muscle fiber can contain from hundreds to thousands of nuclei. A muscle fiber for example in the human biceps with a length of 10 cm can have as many as 3,000 nuclei. Unlike in a non-muscle cell where the nucleus is centrally positioned, the myonucleus is elongated and located close to the sarcolemma. The myonuclei are quite uniformly arranged along the fiber with each nucleus having its own &quot;myonuclear domain&quot; where it is responsible for supporting the volume of cytoplasm in that particular section of the myofiber.

A group of muscle stem cells known as myosatellite cells, also &quot;satellite cells&quot; are found between the basement membrane and the sarcolemma of muscle fibers. These cells are normally quiescent but can be activated by exercise or pathology to provide additional myonuclei for muscle growth or repair.

====Attachment to tendons====
Muscles attach to tendons in a complex interface region known as the musculotendinous junction, also known as the myotendinous junction, an area specialised for the primary transmission of force. At the muscle-tendon interface, force is transmitted from the sarcomeres in the muscle cells to the tendon. Muscles and tendons develop in close association, and after their joining at the myotendinous junction they constitute a dynamic unit for the transmission of force from muscle contraction to the skeletal system.

====Arrangement of muscle fibers====

Muscle architecture refers to the arrangement of muscle fibers relative to the axis of force generation, which runs from a muscle&#x27;s origin to its insertion. 
The usual arrangements are types of parallel, and types of pennate muscle. In parallel muscles, the fascicles run parallel to the axis of force generation, but the fascicles can vary in their relationship to one another, and to their tendons. These variations are seen in fusiform, strap, and convergent muscles. A convergent muscle has a triangular or fan-shape as the fibers converge at its insertion and are fanned out broadly at the origin. A less common example of a parallel muscle is a circular muscle such as the orbicularis oculi, in which the fibers are longitudinally arranged, but create a circle from origin to insertion. These different architectures, can cause variations in the tension that a muscle can create between its tendons.

The fibers in pennate muscles run at an angle to the axis of force generation. This pennation angle reduces the effective force of any individual fiber, as it is effectively pulling off-axis. However, because of this angle, more fibers can be packed into the same muscle volume, increasing the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA). This effect is known as fiber packing, and in terms of force generation, it more than overcomes the efficiency-loss of the off-axis orientation. The trade-off comes in overall speed of muscle shortening and in the total excursion. Overall muscle shortening speed is reduced compared to fiber shortening speed, as is the total distance of shortening. All of these effects scale with pennation angle; greater angles lead to greater force due to increased fiber packing and PCSA, but with greater losses in shortening speed and excursion. Types of pennate muscle are unipennate, bipennate, and multipennate. A unipennate muscle has similarly angled fibers that are on one side of a tendon. A bipennate muscle has fibers on two sides of a tendon. Multipennate muscles have fibers that are oriented at multiple angles along the force-generating axis, and this is the most general and common architecture.

=== Muscle fiber growth ===
Muscle fibers grow when exercised and shrink when not in use. This is due to the fact that exercise stimulates the increase in myofibrils which increase the overall size of muscle cells. Well exercised muscles can not only add more size but can also develop more mitochondria, myoglobin, glycogen and a higher density of capillaries. However, muscle cells cannot divide to produce new cells, and as a result there are fewer muscle cells in an adult than in a newborn.

===Muscle naming===

There are a number of terms used in the naming of muscles including those relating to size, shape, action, location, their orientation, and their number of heads.
;By size: &quot;brevis&quot; means short; &quot;longus&quot; means long; &quot;longissimus&quot; means longest; &quot;magnus&quot; means large; &quot;major&quot; means larger; &quot;maximus&quot; means largest; &quot;minor&quot; means smaller, and &quot;minimus&quot; smallest; &quot;latissimus&quot; means widest, and &quot;vastus&quot; means huge. These terms are often used after the particular muscle such as gluteus maximus, and gluteus minimus.
;By relative shape: &quot;deltoid&quot; means triangular; &quot;quadratus&quot; means having four sides; &quot;rhomboideus&quot; means having a rhomboid shape; &quot;teres&quot; means round or cylindrical, and &quot;trapezius&quot; means having a trapezoid shape; &quot;serratus&quot; means saw-toothed; &quot;orbicularis&quot; means circular; &quot;pectinate&quot; means comblike; &quot;piriformis&quot; means pear-shaped; &quot;platys&quot; means flat and &quot;gracilis&quot; means slender. Examples are the pronator teres, and the pronator quadratus.
;By action: &quot;abductor&quot; moving away from the midline; &quot;adductor&quot; moving towards the midline; &quot;depressor&quot; moving downwards; &quot;elevator&quot; moving upwards; &quot;flexor&quot; moving that decreases an angle; &quot;extensor&quot; moving that increase an angle or straightens; &quot;pronator&quot; moving to face down; &quot;supinator&quot; moving to face upwards; &quot;internal rotator&quot; rotating towards the body; &quot;external rotator&quot; rotating away from the body; &quot;sphincter&quot; decreases the size, and &quot;tensor&quot; gives tension to; &quot;fixator muscles&quot; serve to fix a joint in a given position by stabilizing the prime mover whilst other joints are moving.
;By number of heads:&quot;biceps&quot; two; &quot;triceps&quot; three and &quot;quadriceps&quot; four.
;By location: named after the near main structure such as the temporal muscle (temporalis) near to the temporal bone. Also &quot;supra-&quot; above; &quot;infra-&quot; below, and &quot;sub-&quot; under. 
;By fascicle orientation: Relative to the midline, &quot;rectus&quot; means parallel to the midline; &quot;transverse&quot; means perpendicular to the midline, and &quot;oblique&quot; means diagonal to the midline. Relative to the axis of the generation of force – types of &quot;parallel&quot;, and types of &quot;pennate&quot; muscles.

==Fiber types==
Broadly there are two types of muscle fiber: Type I, which is slow, and Type II which are fast. Type II has two divisions of type IIA (oxidative), and type IIX (glycolytic), giving three main fiber types. These fibers have relatively distinct metabolic, contractile, and motor unit properties. The table below differentiates these types of properties. These types of properties—while they are partly dependent on the properties of individual fibers—tend to be relevant and measured at the level of the motor unit, rather than individual fiber.

Slow oxidative (type I) fibers contract relatively slowly and use aerobic respiration to produce ATP. Fast oxidative (type IIA) fibers have fast contractions and primarily use aerobic respiration, but because they may switch to anaerobic respiration (glycolysis), can fatigue more quickly than slow oxidative fibers. Fast glycolytic (type IIX) fibers have fast contractions and primarily use anaerobic glycolysis. The FG fibers fatigue more quickly than the others. Most skeletal muscles in a human contain(s) all three types, although in varying proportions.

===Fiber color===
Traditionally, fibers were categorized depending on their varying color, which is a reflection of myoglobin content. Type I fibers appear red due to the high levels of myoglobin. Red muscle fibers tend to have more mitochondria and greater local capillary density. These fibers are more suited for endurance and are slow to fatigue because they use oxidative metabolism to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Less oxidative Type II fibers are white due to relatively low myoglobin and a reliance on glycolytic enzymes.

===Twitch speed===
Fibers can also be classified on their twitch capabilities, into fast and slow twitch. These traits largely, but not completely, overlap the classifications based on color, ATPase, or MHC (myosin heavy chain).

Some authors define a fast twitch fiber as one in which the myosin can split ATP very quickly. These mainly include the ATPase type II and MHC type II fibers. However, fast twitch fibers also demonstrate a higher capability for electrochemical transmission of action potentials and a rapid level of calcium release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The fast twitch fibers rely on a well-developed, anaerobic, short term, glycolytic system for energy transfer and can contract and develop tension at 2–3 times the rate of slow twitch fibers. Fast twitch muscles are much better at generating short bursts of strength or speed than slow muscles, and so fatigue more quickly.

The slow twitch fibers generate energy for ATP re-synthesis by means of a long term system of aerobic energy transfer. These mainly include the ATPase type I and MHC type I fibers. They tend to have a low activity level of ATPase, a slower speed of contraction with a less well developed glycolytic capacity. Fibers that become slow-twitch develop greater numbers of mitochondria and capillaries making them better for prolonged work.

====Type distribution====
Individual muscles tend to be a mixture of various fiber types, but their proportions vary depending on the actions of that muscle. For instance, in humans, the quadriceps muscles contain ~52% type I fibers, while the soleus is ~80% type I. The orbicularis oculi muscle of the eye is only ~15% type I. Motor units within the muscle, however, have minimal variation between the fibers of that unit. It is this fact that makes the size principal of motor unit recruitment viable.

The total number of skeletal muscle fibers has traditionally been thought not to change.
It is believed there are no sex or age differences in fiber distribution; however, proportions of fiber types vary considerably from muscle to muscle and person to person. Among different species there is much variation in the proportions of muscle fiber types.

Sedentary men and women (as well as young children) have 45% type II and 55% type I fibers.
People at the higher end of any sport tend to demonstrate patterns of fiber distribution e.g. endurance athletes show a higher level of type I fibers.
Sprint athletes, on the other hand, require large numbers of type IIX fibers.
Middle-distance event athletes show approximately equal distribution of the two types. This is also often the case for power athletes such as throwers and jumpers.
It has been suggested that various types of exercise can induce changes in the fibers of a skeletal muscle.

It is thought that by performing endurance type events for a sustained period of time, some of the type IIX fibers transform into type IIA fibers. However, there is no consensus on the subject.
It may well be that the type IIX fibers show enhancements of the oxidative capacity after high intensity endurance training which brings them to a level at which they are able to perform oxidative metabolism as effectively as slow twitch fibers of untrained subjects. This would be brought about by an increase in mitochondrial size and number and the associated related changes, not a change in fiber type.

===Fiber typing methods===

There are numerous methods employed for fiber-typing, and confusion between the methods is common among non-experts. Two commonly confused methods are histochemical staining for myosin ATPase activity and immunohistochemical staining for myosin heavy chain (MHC) type. Myosin ATPase activity is commonly—and correctly—referred to as simply &quot;fiber type&quot;, and results from the direct assaying of ATPase activity under various conditions (e.g. pH). Myosin heavy chain staining is most accurately referred to as &quot;MHC fiber type&quot;, e.g. &quot;MHC IIa fibers&quot;, and results from determination of different MHC isoforms. These methods are closely related physiologically, as the MHC type is the primary determinant of ATPase activity. However, neither of these typing methods is directly metabolic in nature; they do not directly address oxidative or glycolytic capacity of the fiber.

When &quot;type I&quot; or &quot;type II&quot; fibers are referred to generically, this most accurately refers to the sum of numerical fiber types (I vs. II) as assessed by myosin ATPase activity staining (e.g. &quot;type II&quot; fibers refers to type IIA + type IIAX + type IIXA ... etc.).

Below is a table showing the relationship between these two methods, limited to fiber types found in humans. Subtype capitalization is used in fiber typing vs. MHC typing, and some ATPase types actually contain multiple MHC types. Also, a subtype B or b is not expressed in humans by either method. Early researchers believed humans to express a MHC IIb, which led to the ATPase classification of IIB. However, later research showed that the human MHC IIb was in fact IIx, indicating that the IIB is better named IIX. IIb is expressed in other mammals, so is still accurately seen (along with IIB) in the literature. Non human fiber types include true IIb fibers, IIc, IId, etc.


Further fiber typing methods are less formally delineated, and exist on more of a spectrum. They tend to be focused more on metabolic and functional capacities (i.e., oxidative vs. glycolytic, fast vs. slow contraction time). As noted above, fiber typing by ATPase or MHC does not directly measure or dictate these parameters. However, many of the various methods are mechanistically linked, while others are correlated &quot;in vivo&quot;. For instance, ATPase fiber type is related to contraction speed, because high ATPase activity allows faster crossbridge cycling. While ATPase activity is only one component of contraction speed, Type I fibers are &quot;slow&quot;, in part, because they have low speeds of ATPase activity in comparison to Type II fibers. However, measuring contraction speed is not the same as ATPase fiber typing.

== Muscle fiber type evolution ==
Almost all multicellular animals depend on muscles to move. Generally, muscular systems of most multicellular animals comprise both slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscle fibers, though the proportions of each fiber type can vary across organisms and environments. The ability to shift their phenotypic fiber type proportions through training and responding to the environment has served organisms well when placed in changing environments either requiring short explosive movements (higher fast twitch proportion) or long duration of movement (higher slow twitch proportion) to survive. Bodybuilding has shown that changes in muscle mass and force production can change in a matter of months. Some examples of this variation are described below.

=== Examples of muscle fiber variation in different animals ===

==== Invertebrates ====
American lobster, &quot;Homarus americanus&quot;, has three fiber types including fast twitch fibers, slow-twitch and slow-tonic fibers. Slow-tonic is a slow twitch-fiber that can sustain longer contractions (tonic).  In lobsters, muscles in different body parts vary in the muscle fiber type proportions based on the purpose of the muscle group.

==== Vertebrates ====
In the early development of vertebrate embryos, growth and formation of muscle happens in successive waves or phases of myogenesis. The myosin heavy chain isotype is a major determinant of the specific fiber type. In zebrafish embryos, the first muscle fibers to form are the slow twitch fibers. These cells will undergo migration from their original location to form a monolayer of slow twitch muscle fibers. These muscle fibers undergo further differentiation as the embryo matures.

==== Reptiles ====
In larger animals, different muscle groups will increasingly require different fiber type proportions within muscle for different purposes. Turtles, such as &quot;Trachemys scripta elegans&quot;, have complementary muscles within the neck that show a potential inverse trend of fiber type percentages (one muscle has high percentage of fast twitch, while the complementary muscle will have a higher percentage of slow twitch fibers). The complementary muscles of turtles had similar percentages of fiber types.

==== Mammals ====
Chimpanzee muscles are composed of 67% fast-twitch fibers and have a maximum dynamic force and power output 1.35 times higher than human muscles of similar size. Among mammals, there is a predominance of type II fibers utilizing glycolytic metabolism. Because of the discrepancy in fast twitch fibers compared to humans, chimpanzees outperform humans in power related tests. Humans, however, will do better at exercise in aerobic range requiring large metabolic costs such as walking (bipedalism).

=== Genetic conservation versus functional conservation ===
Across species, certain gene sequences have been preserved, but do not always have the same functional purpose. Within the zebrafish embryo, the &quot;Prdm1&quot; gene down-regulates the formation of new slow twitch fibers through direct and indirect mechanisms such as &quot;Sox6&quot; (indirect). In mice, the &quot;Prdm1&quot; gene is present but does not control slow muscle genes in mice through &quot;Sox6&quot;.

=== Plasticity ===

In addition to having a genetic basis, the composition of muscle fiber types is flexible and can vary with a number of different environmental factors. This plasticity can, arguably, be the strongest evolutionary advantage among organisms with muscle.

In fish, different fiber types are expressed at different water temperatures. Cold temperatures require more efficient metabolism within muscle and fatigue resistance is important. While in more tropical environments, fast powerful movements (from higher fast-twitch proportions) may prove more beneficial in the long run.

In rodents such as rats, the transitory nature of their muscle is highly prevalent. They have high percentage of hybrid muscle fibers and have up to 60% in fast-to-slow transforming muscle.

Environmental influences such as diet, exercise and lifestyle types have a pivotal role in proportions of fiber type in humans. Aerobic exercise will shift the proportions towards slow twitch fibers, while explosive powerlifting and sprinting will transition fibers towards fast twitch. In animals, &quot;exercise training&quot; will look more like the need for long durations of movement or short explosive movements to escape predators or catch prey.

==Microanatomy==
Skeletal muscle exhibits a distinctive banding pattern when viewed under the microscope due to the arrangement of two contractile proteins myosin, and actin – that are two of the myofilaments in the myofibrils. The myosin forms the thick filaments, and actin forms the thin filaments, and are arranged in repeating units called sarcomeres. The interaction of both proteins results in muscle contraction.

The sarcomere is attached to other organelles such as the mitochondria by intermediate filaments in the cytoskeleton. The costamere attaches the sarcomere to the sarcolemma.

Every single organelle and macromolecule of a muscle fiber is arranged to ensure that it meets desired functions. The cell membrane is called the sarcolemma with the cytoplasm known as the sarcoplasm. In the sarcoplasm are the myofibrils. The myofibrils are long protein bundles about one micrometer in diameter. Pressed against the inside of the sarcolemma are the unusual flattened myonuclei. Between the myofibrils are the mitochondria.

While the muscle fiber does not have smooth endoplasmic cisternae, it contains sarcoplasmic reticulum. The sarcoplasmic reticulum surrounds the myofibrils and holds a reserve of the calcium ions needed to cause a muscle contraction. Periodically, it has dilated end sacs known as terminal cisternae. These cross the muscle fiber from one side to the other. In between two terminal cisternae is a tubular infolding called a transverse tubule (T tubule). T tubules are the pathways for action potentials to signal the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium, causing a muscle contraction. Together, two terminal cisternae and a transverse tubule form a triad.

==Development==
All muscles are derived from paraxial mesoderm. During embryonic development in the process of somitogenesis the paraxial mesoderm is divided along the embryo&#x27;s length to form somites, corresponding to the segmentation of the body most obviously seen in the vertebral column. Each somite has three divisions, sclerotome (which forms vertebrae), dermatome (which forms skin), and myotome (which forms muscle). The myotome is divided into two sections, the epimere and hypomere, which form epaxial and hypaxial muscles, respectively. The only epaxial muscles in humans are the erector spinae and small vertebral muscles, and are innervated by the dorsal rami of the spinal nerves. All other muscles, including those of the limbs are hypaxial, and innervated by the ventral rami of the spinal nerves.

During development, myoblasts (muscle progenitor cells) either remain in the somite to form muscles associated with the vertebral column or migrate out into the body to form all other muscles. Myoblast migration is preceded by the formation of connective tissue frameworks, usually formed from the somatic lateral plate mesoderm. Myoblasts follow chemical signals to the appropriate locations, where they fuse into elongated multinucleated skeletal muscle cells.

Between the tenth and the eighteenth weeks of gestation, all muscle cells have fast myosin heavy chains; two myotube types become distinguished in the developing fetus – both expressing fast chains but one expressing fast and slow chains. Between 10 and 40 per cent of the fibers express the slow myosin chain.

Fiber types are established during embryonic development and are remodelled later in the adult by neural and hormonal influences. The population of satellite cells present underneath the basal lamina is necessary for the postnatal development of muscle cells.

==Function==
The primary function of muscle is contraction. Following contraction, skeletal muscle functions as an endocrine organ by secreting myokines – a wide range of cytokines and other peptides that act as signalling molecules. Myokines in turn are believed to mediate the health benefits of exercise. Myokines are secreted into the bloodstream after muscle contraction. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is the most studied myokine, other muscle contraction-induced myokines include BDNF, FGF21, and SPARC.

Muscle also functions to produce body heat. Muscle contraction is responsible for producing 85% of the body&#x27;s heat. This heat produced is as a by-product of muscular activity, and is mostly wasted. As a homeostatic response to extreme cold, muscles are signaled to trigger contractions of shivering in order to generate heat.
===Contraction===


Contraction is achieved by the muscle&#x27;s structural unit, the muscle fiber, and by its functional unit, the motor unit. Muscle fibers are excitable cells stimulated by motor neurons. The motor unit consists of a motor neuron and the many fibers that it makes contact with. A single muscle is stimulated by many motor units. Muscle fibers are
subject to depolarization by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, released by the motor neurons at the neuromuscular junctions.

In addition to the actin and myosin myofilaments in the myofibrils that make up the contractile sarcomeres, there are two other important regulatory proteins – troponin and tropomyosin, that make muscle contraction possible. These proteins are associated with actin and cooperate to prevent its interaction with myosin. Once a cell is sufficiently stimulated, the cell&#x27;s sarcoplasmic reticulum releases ionic calcium (Ca2+), which then interacts with the regulatory protein troponin. Calcium-bound troponin undergoes a conformational change that leads to the movement of tropomyosin, subsequently exposing the myosin-binding sites on actin. This allows for myosin and actin ATP-dependent cross-bridge cycling and shortening of the muscle.

====Excitation-contraction coupling====
Excitation contraction coupling is the process by which a muscular action potential in the muscle fiber causes the myofibrils to contract. This process relies on a direct coupling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel RYR1 (ryanodine receptor 1), and voltage-gated L-type calcium channels (identified as dihydropyridine receptors, DHPRs). DHPRs are located on the sarcolemma (which includes the surface sarcolemma and the transverse tubules), while the RyRs reside across the SR membrane. The close apposition of a transverse tubule and two SR regions containing RyRs is described as a triad and is predominantly where excitation–contraction coupling takes place. Excitation–contraction coupling occurs when depolarization of skeletal muscle cell results in a muscle action potential, which spreads across the cell surface and into the muscle fiber&#x27;s network of T-tubules, thereby depolarizing the inner portion of the muscle fiber. Depolarization of the inner portions activates dihydropyridine receptors in the terminal cisternae, which are close to ryanodine receptors in the adjacent sarcoplasmic reticulum. The activated dihydropyridine receptors physically interact with ryanodine receptors to activate them via foot processes (involving conformational changes that allosterically activates the ryanodine receptors). As the ryanodine receptors open, is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the local junctional space and diffuses into the bulk cytoplasm to cause a calcium spark. The sarcoplasmic reticulum has a large calcium buffering capacity partially due to a calcium-binding protein called calsequestrin. The near synchronous activation of thousands of calcium sparks by the action potential causes a cell-wide increase in calcium giving rise to the upstroke of the calcium transient. The released into the cytosol binds to Troponin C by the actin filaments, to allow crossbridge cycling, producing force and, in some situations, motion. The sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) actively pumps back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. As declines back to resting levels, the force declines and relaxation occurs.

====Muscle movement====

The efferent leg of the peripheral nervous system is responsible for conveying commands to the muscles and glands, and is ultimately responsible for voluntary movement. Nerves move muscles in response to voluntary and autonomic (involuntary) signals from the brain. Deep muscles, superficial muscles, and internal muscles all correspond with dedicated regions in the primary motor cortex of the brain, directly anterior to the central sulcus that divides the frontal and parietal lobes.

In addition, muscles react to reflexive nerve stimuli that do not always send signals all the way to the brain. In this case, the signal from the afferent fiber does not reach the brain, but produces the reflexive movement by direct connections with the efferent nerves in the spine. However, the majority of muscle activity is volitional, and the result of complex interactions between various areas of the brain.

Nerves that control skeletal muscles in mammals correspond with neuron groups along the primary motor cortex of the brain&#x27;s cerebral cortex. Commands are routed through the basal ganglia and are modified by input from the cerebellum before being relayed through the pyramidal tract to the spinal cord and from there to the motor end plate at the muscles. Along the way, feedback, such as that of the extrapyramidal system contribute signals to influence muscle tone and response.

Deeper muscles such as those involved in posture often are controlled from nuclei in the brain stem and basal ganglia.

==== Proprioception ====

In skeletal muscles, muscle spindles convey information about the degree of muscle length and stretch to the central nervous system to assist in maintaining posture and joint position. The sense of where our bodies are in space is called proprioception, the perception of body awareness, the &quot;unconscious&quot; awareness of where the various regions of the body are located at any one time. Several areas in the brain coordinate movement and position with the feedback information gained from proprioception. The cerebellum and red nucleus in particular continuously sample position against movement and make minor corrections to assure smooth motion.

=== Energy consumption ===
Muscular activity accounts for much of the body&#x27;s energy consumption. All muscle cells produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules which are used to power the movement of the myosin heads. Muscles have a short-term store of energy in the form of creatine phosphate which is generated from ATP and can regenerate ATP when needed with creatine kinase. Muscles also keep a storage form of glucose in the form of glycogen. Glycogen can be rapidly converted to glucose when energy is required for sustained, powerful contractions. Within the voluntary skeletal muscles, the glucose molecule can be metabolized anaerobically in a process called glycolysis which produces two ATP and two lactic acid molecules in the process (in aerobic conditions, lactate is not formed; instead pyruvate is formed and transmitted through the citric acid cycle). Muscle cells also contain globules of fat, which are used for energy during aerobic exercise. The aerobic energy systems take longer to produce the ATP and reach peak efficiency, and requires many more biochemical steps, but produces significantly more ATP than anaerobic glycolysis. Cardiac muscle on the other hand, can readily consume any of the three macronutrients (protein, glucose and fat) aerobically without a &#x27;warm up&#x27; period and always extracts the maximum ATP yield from any molecule involved. The heart, liver and red blood cells will also consume lactic acid produced and excreted by skeletal muscles during exercise.

Skeletal muscle uses more calories than other organs.
At rest it consumes 54.4 kJ/kg (13.0 kcal/kg) per day. This is larger than adipose tissue (fat) at 18.8 kJ/kg (4.5 kcal/kg), and bone at 9.6 kJ/kg (2.3 kcal/kg).

==== Efficiency ====

The efficiency of human muscle has been measured (in the context of rowing and cycling) at 18% to 26%. The efficiency is defined as the ratio of mechanical work output to the total metabolic cost, as can be calculated from oxygen consumption. This low efficiency is the result of about 40% efficiency of generating ATP from food energy, losses in converting energy from ATP into mechanical work inside the muscle, and mechanical losses inside the body. The latter two losses are dependent on the type of exercise and the type of muscle fibers being used (fast-twitch or slow-twitch). For an overall efficiency of 20 percent, one watt of mechanical power is equivalent to 4.3 kcal per hour. For example, one manufacturer of rowing equipment calibrates its rowing ergometer to count burned calories as equal to four times the actual mechanical work, plus 300 kcal per hour, this amounts to about 20 percent efficiency at 250 watts of mechanical output. The mechanical energy output of a cyclic contraction can depend upon many factors, including activation timing, muscle strain trajectory, and rates of force rise &amp; decay. These can be synthesized experimentally using work loop analysis.

===Muscle strength ===
Muscle strength is a result of three overlapping factors: &quot;physiological strength&quot; (muscle size, cross sectional area, available crossbridging, responses to training), &quot;neurological strength&quot; (how strong or weak is the signal that tells the muscle to contract), and &quot;mechanical strength&quot; (muscle&#x27;s force angle on the lever, moment arm length, joint capabilities).

Vertebrate muscle typically produces approximately of force per square centimeter of muscle cross-sectional area when isometric and at optimal length. Some invertebrate muscles, such as in crab claws, have much longer sarcomeres than vertebrates, resulting in many more sites for actin and myosin to bind and thus much greater force per square centimeter at the cost of much slower speed. The force generated by a contraction can be measured non-invasively using either mechanomyography or phonomyography, be measured in vivo using tendon strain (if a prominent tendon is present), or be measured directly using more invasive methods.

The strength of any given muscle, in terms of force exerted on the skeleton, depends upon length, shortening speed, cross sectional area, pennation, sarcomere length, myosin isoforms, and neural activation of motor units. Significant reductions in muscle strength can indicate underlying pathology, with the chart at right used as a guide.

The &quot;maximum holding time&quot; for a contracted muscle depends on its supply of energy and is stated by Rohmert&#x27;s law to exponentially decay from the beginning of exertion.

==== The &quot;strongest&quot; human muscle ====

Since three factors affect muscular strength simultaneously and muscles never work individually, it is misleading to compare strength in individual muscles, and state that one is the &quot;strongest&quot;. But below are several muscles whose strength is noteworthy for different reasons.
* In ordinary parlance, muscular &quot;strength&quot; usually refers to the ability to exert a force on an external object—for example, lifting a weight. By this definition, the masseter or jaw muscle is the strongest. The 1992 Guinness Book of Records records the achievement of a bite strength of for 2 seconds. What distinguishes the masseter is not anything special about the muscle itself, but its advantage in working against a much shorter lever arm than other muscles.
* If &quot;strength&quot; refers to the force exerted by the muscle itself, e.g., on the place where it inserts into a bone, then the strongest muscles are those with the largest cross-sectional area. This is because the tension exerted by an individual skeletal muscle fiber does not vary much. Each fiber can exert a force on the order of 0.3 micronewton. By this definition, the strongest muscle of the body is usually said to be the quadriceps femoris or the gluteus maximus.
* Because muscle strength is determined by cross-sectional area, a shorter muscle will be stronger &quot;pound for pound&quot; (i.e., by weight) than a longer muscle of the same cross-sectional area. The myometrial layer of the uterus may be the strongest muscle by weight in the female body. At the time when an infant is delivered, the entire uterus weighs about 1.1 kg (40 oz). During childbirth, the uterus exerts 100 to 400 N (25 to 100 lbf) of downward force with each contraction.
* The external muscles of the eye are conspicuously large and strong in relation to the small size and weight of the eyeball. It is frequently said that they are &quot;the strongest muscles for the job they have to do&quot; and are sometimes claimed to be &quot;100 times stronger than they need to be.&quot; However, eye movements (particularly saccades used on facial scanning and reading) do require high speed movements, and eye muscles are exercised nightly during rapid eye movement sleep.
* The statement that &quot;the tongue is the strongest muscle in the body&quot; appears frequently in lists of surprising facts, but it is difficult to find any definition of &quot;strength&quot; that would make this statement true. The tongue consists of eight muscles, not one.

====Force generation====
Muscle force is proportional to physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), and muscle velocity is proportional to muscle fiber length. The torque around a joint, however, is determined by a number of biomechanical parameters, including the distance between muscle insertions and pivot points, muscle size and architectural gear ratio. Muscles are normally arranged in opposition so that when one group of muscles contracts, another group relaxes or lengthens. Antagonism in the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles means that it is impossible to fully stimulate the contraction of two antagonistic muscles at any one time. During ballistic motions such as throwing, the antagonist muscles act to &#x27;brake&#x27; the agonist muscles throughout the contraction, particularly at the end of the motion. In the example of throwing, the chest and front of the shoulder (anterior deltoid) contract to pull the arm forward, while the muscles in the back and rear of the shoulder (posterior deltoid) also contract and undergo eccentric contraction to slow the motion down to avoid injury. Part of the training process is learning to relax the antagonist muscles to increase the force input of the chest and anterior shoulder.

Contracting muscles produce vibration and sound. Slow twitch fibers produce 10 to 30 contractions per second (10 to 30 Hz). Fast twitch fibers produce 30 to 70 contractions per second (30 to 70 Hz). The vibration can be witnessed and felt by highly tensing one&#x27;s muscles, as when making a firm fist. The sound can be heard by pressing a highly tensed muscle against the ear, again a firm fist is a good example. The sound is usually described as a rumbling sound. Some individuals can voluntarily produce this rumbling sound by contracting the tensor tympani muscle of the middle ear. The rumbling sound can also be heard when the neck or jaw muscles are highly tensed.

===Signal transduction pathways===

Skeletal muscle fiber-type phenotype in adult animals is regulated by several independent signaling pathways. These include pathways involved with the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, calcineurin, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV, and the peroxisome proliferator γ coactivator 1 (PGC-1). The Ras/MAPK signaling pathway links the motor neurons and signaling systems, coupling excitation and transcription regulation to promote the nerve-dependent induction of the slow program in regenerating muscle. Calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-activated phosphatase implicated in nerve activity-dependent fiber-type specification in skeletal muscle, directly controls the phosphorylation state of the transcription factor NFAT, allowing for its translocation to the nucleus and leading to the activation of slow-type muscle proteins in cooperation with myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) proteins and other regulatory proteins. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity is also upregulated by slow motor neuron activity, possibly because it amplifies the slow-type calcineurin-generated responses by promoting MEF2 transactivator functions and enhancing oxidative capacity through stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis.

Contraction-induced changes in intracellular calcium or reactive oxygen species provide signals to diverse pathways that include the MAPKs, calcineurin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV to activate transcription factors that regulate gene expression and enzyme activity in skeletal muscle.

PGC1-α (PPARGC1A), a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear receptors important to the regulation of a number of mitochondrial genes involved in oxidative metabolism, directly interacts with MEF2 to synergistically activate selective slow twitch (ST) muscle genes and also serves as a target for calcineurin signaling. A peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ)-mediated transcriptional pathway is involved in the regulation of the skeletal muscle fiber phenotype. Mice that harbor an activated form of PPARδ display an &quot;endurance&quot; phenotype, with a coordinated increase in oxidative enzymes and mitochondrial biogenesis and an increased proportion of ST fibers. Thus—through functional genomics—calcineurin, calmodulin-dependent kinase, PGC-1α, and activated PPARδ form the basis of a signaling network that controls skeletal muscle fiber-type transformation and metabolic profiles that protect against insulin resistance and obesity.

The transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism during intense work requires that several systems are rapidly activated to ensure a constant supply of ATP for the working muscles. These include a switch from fat-based to carbohydrate-based fuels, a redistribution of blood flow from nonworking to exercising muscles, and the removal of several of the by-products of anaerobic metabolism, such as carbon dioxide and lactic acid. Some of these responses are governed by transcriptional control of the fast twitch (FT) glycolytic phenotype. For example, skeletal muscle reprogramming from an ST glycolytic phenotype to an FT glycolytic phenotype involves the Six1/Eya1 complex, composed of members of the Six protein family. Moreover, the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1A) has been identified as a master regulator for the expression of genes involved in essential hypoxic responses that maintain ATP levels in cells. Ablation of HIF-1α in skeletal muscle was associated with an increase in the activity of rate-limiting enzymes of the mitochondria, indicating that the citric acid cycle and increased fatty acid oxidation may be compensating for decreased flow through the glycolytic pathway in these animals. However, hypoxia-mediated HIF-1α responses are also linked to the regulation of mitochondrial dysfunction through the formation of excessive reactive oxygen species in mitochondria.

Other pathways also influence adult muscle character. For example, physical force inside a muscle fiber may release the transcription factor serum response factor from the structural protein titin, leading to altered muscle growth.

== Exercise ==
Physical exercise is often recommended as a means of improving motor skills, fitness, muscle and bone strength, and joint function. Exercise has several effects upon muscles, connective tissue, bone, and the nerves that stimulate the muscles. One such effect is muscle hypertrophy, an increase in size of muscle due to an increase in the number of muscle fibers or cross-sectional area of myofibrils. Muscle changes depend on the type of exercise used.

Generally, there are two types of exercise regimes, aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic exercise (e.g. marathons) involves activities of low intensity but long duration, during which the muscles used are below their maximal contraction strength. Aerobic activities rely on aerobic respiration (i.e. citric acid cycle and electron transport chain) for metabolic energy by consuming fat, protein, carbohydrates, and oxygen. Muscles involved in aerobic exercises contain a higher percentage of Type I (or slow-twitch) muscle fibers, which primarily contain mitochondrial and oxidation enzymes associated with aerobic respiration. On the contrary, anaerobic exercise is associated with activities of high intensity but short duration, such as sprinting or weight lifting. The anaerobic activities predominately use Type II, fast-twitch, muscle fibers. Type II muscle fibers rely on glucogenesis for energy during anaerobic exercise. During anaerobic exercise, type II fibers consume little oxygen, protein and fat, produce large amounts of lactic acid and are fatigable. Many exercises are partially aerobic and anaerobic; for example, soccer and rock climbing.

The presence of lactic acid has an inhibitory effect on ATP generation within the muscle. It can even stop ATP production if the intracellular concentration becomes too high. However, endurance training mitigates the buildup of lactic acid through increased capillarization and myoglobin. This increases the ability to remove waste products, like lactic acid, out of the muscles in order to not impair muscle function. Once moved out of muscles, lactic acid can be used by other muscles or body tissues as a source of energy, or transported to the liver where it is converted back to pyruvate. In addition to increasing the level of lactic acid, strenuous exercise results in the loss of potassium ions in muscle. This may facilitate the recovery of muscle function by protecting against fatigue.

Delayed onset muscle soreness is pain or discomfort that may be felt one to three days after exercising and generally subsides two to three days later. Once thought to be caused by lactic acid build-up, a more recent theory is that it is caused by tiny tears in the muscle fibers caused by eccentric contraction, or unaccustomed training levels. Since lactic acid disperses fairly rapidly, it could not explain pain experienced days after exercise.

==Clinical significance==
===Muscle disease ===

Diseases of skeletal muscle are termed myopathies, while diseases of nerves are called neuropathies. Both can affect muscle function or cause muscle pain, and fall under the umbrella of neuromuscular disease. The cause of many myopathies is attributed to mutations in the various associated muscle proteins. Some inflammatory myopathies include polymyositis and inclusion body myositis

Neuromuscular diseases affect the muscles and their nervous control. In general, problems with nervous control can cause spasticity or paralysis, depending on the location and nature of the problem. A number of movement disorders are caused by neurological disorders such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Huntington&#x27;s disease where there is central nervous system dysfunction.

Symptoms of muscle diseases may include weakness, spasticity, myoclonus and myalgia. Diagnostic procedures that may reveal muscular disorders include testing creatine kinase levels in the blood and electromyography (measuring electrical activity in muscles). In some cases, muscle biopsy may be done to identify a myopathy, as well as genetic testing to identify DNA abnormalities associated with specific myopathies and dystrophies.

A non-invasive elastography technique that measures muscle noise is undergoing experimentation to provide a way of monitoring neuromuscular disease. The sound produced by a muscle comes from the shortening of actomyosin filaments along the axis of the muscle. During contraction, the muscle shortens along its length and expands across its width, producing vibrations at the surface.

=== Hypertrophy ===

Independent of strength and performance measures, muscles can be induced to grow larger by a number of factors, including hormone signaling, developmental factors, strength training, and disease. Contrary to popular belief, the number of muscle fibres cannot be increased through exercise. Instead, muscles grow larger through a combination of muscle cell growth as new protein filaments are added along with additional mass provided by undifferentiated satellite cells alongside the existing muscle cells.

Biological factors such as age and hormone levels can affect muscle hypertrophy. During puberty in males, hypertrophy occurs at an accelerated rate as the levels of growth-stimulating hormones produced by the body increase. Natural hypertrophy normally stops at full growth in the late teens. As testosterone is one of the body&#x27;s major growth hormones, on average, men find hypertrophy much easier to achieve than women. Taking additional testosterone or other anabolic steroids will increase muscular hypertrophy.

Muscular, spinal and neural factors all affect muscle building. Sometimes a person may notice an increase in strength in a given muscle even though only its opposite has been subject to exercise, such as when a bodybuilder finds her left biceps stronger after completing a regimen focusing only on the right biceps. This phenomenon is called cross education.

=== Atrophy ===

Every day between one and two percent of muscle is broken down and rebuilt. Inactivity, malnutrition, disease, and aging can increase the breakdown leading to muscle atrophy or sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is commonly an age-related process that can cause frailty and its consequences. A decrease in muscle mass may be accompanied by a smaller number and size of the muscle cells as well as lower protein content.

Human spaceflight, involving prolonged periods of immobilization and weightlessness is known to result in muscle weakening and atrophy resulting in a loss of as much as 30% of mass in some muscles. Such consequences are also noted in some mammals following hibernation.

Many diseases and conditions including cancer, AIDS, and heart failure can cause muscle loss known as cachexia.

===Research===
Myopathies have been modeled with cell culture systems of muscle from healthy or diseased tissue biopsies. Another source of skeletal muscle and progenitors is provided by the directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.

Research on skeletal muscle properties uses many techniques. Electrical muscle stimulation is used to determine force and contraction speed at different frequencies related to fiber-type composition and mix within an individual muscle group. In vitro muscle testing is used for more complete characterization of muscle properties.

The electrical activity associated with muscle contraction is measured via electromyography (EMG). Skeletal muscle has two physiological responses: relaxation and contraction. The mechanisms for which these responses occur generate electrical activity measured by EMG. Specifically, EMG can measure the action potential of a skeletal muscle, which occurs from the hyperpolarization of the motor axons from nerve impulses sent to the muscle. EMG is used in research for determining if the skeletal muscle of interest is being activated, the amount of force generated, and an indicator of muscle fatigue. The two types of EMG are intra-muscular EMG and the most common, surface EMG. The EMG signals are much greater when a skeletal muscle is contracting verses relaxing. However, for smaller and deeper skeletal muscles the EMG signals are reduced and therefore are viewed as a less valued technique for measuring the activation. In research using EMG, a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) is commonly performed on the skeletal muscle of interest, to have reference data for the rest of the EMG recordings during the main experimental testing for that same skeletal muscle.

Research into the development of artificial muscles includes the use of electroactive polymers.

==Mononuclear cells of skeletal muscle==

Nuclei present in skeletal muscle are about 50% myocyte nuclei and 50% mononuclear cell nuclei. Mononuclear cells found in skeletal muscle tissue samples from mice and humans can be identified by messenger RNA transcription of cell type markers. Cameron et al. identified nine cell types. They include endothelial cells that line capillaries (45% of cells), fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs)(20%), pericytes (14%) and endothelial-like pericytes (4%). Another 9% of mononuclear cells are muscle stem cells, adjacent to muscle fiber cells. Types of lymphoid cells (such as B-cells and T-cells) (3%) and myeloid cells such as macrophages (2%) made up most of the remaining mononuclear cells of skeletal muscle. In addition, Cameron et al. also identified two types of myocyte cells, Type I and Type II. Each of the different types of cells in skeletal muscle was found to express different sets of genes. The median number of genes expressed in each of the nine different cell types was 1,331 genes. When a biopsy is taken from a thigh muscle, however, the biopsy contains all the different cell types. Mixed together, in a biopsy of human thigh skeletal muscle, there are 13,026 to 13,108 genes with detected expression.

==Endocrine functions of skeletal muscle==

As pointed out in the Introduction to this article, under different physiological conditions, subsets of 654 different proteins as well as lipids, amino acids, metabolites and small RNAs occur in the secretome of skeletal muscles. As described in the Wikipedia article &quot;List of human endocrine organs and actions&quot;, skeletal muscle is identified as an endocrine organ due to its secretion of cytokines and other peptides produced by skeletal muscle as signaling molecules. Iizuka et al., indicated that skeletal muscle is an endocrine organ because it &quot;synthesizes and secretes multiple factors, and these muscle derived-factors exert beneficial effects on peripheral and remote organs.&quot; The altered secretomes after endurance training or resistance training as well as the secretome of sedentary muscle appear to have many effects on distant tissues.

===Sedentary skeletal muscle mass affects executive mental function===

A study in Canada tested the effect of muscle mass on mental functions during aging. An expectation of the study was that the endocrine components of the secretome specific to skeletal muscle could protect cognitive functions. The skeletal muscle mass of arms and legs of 8,279 Canadians over the age of 65 and in average health was measured at baseline and after three years. Of these individuals, 1,605 participants (19.4%) were considered to have a low skeletal muscle mass at baseline, with less than 7.30 kg/m2 for males, and less than 5.42 kg/m2 for females (levels defined as sarcopenia in Canada).

Executive mental function, memory and psychomotor speed were each measured at baseline and after three years. Executive mental function was measured with standard tests, including the ability to say the sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3-C…, to name a number of animals in one minute, and with the Stroop test. The study found that those individuals with lower skeletal muscle mass at the start of the study declined in their executive mental function considerably more sharply than those with higher muscle mass. Memory, as well as psychomotor speed, on the other hand, did not correlate with skeletal muscle mass. Thus, larger muscle mass, with a concomitantly larger secretome, appeared to have the endocrine function of protecting the executive mental function of individuals over the age of 65.

===Walking, using skeletal muscles, affects mortality===

Paluch et al. compared the average number of steps walked per day to the risk of mortality, both for adults over 60 years old and for adults under 60 years old. The study was a meta-analysis of 15 studies, which, combined, evaluated 47,471 adults over a period of 7 years. Individuals were divided into approximately equal quartiles. The lowest quartile averaged 3,553 steps/day, the second quartile 5,801 steps/day, the third quartile 7,842 steps/day and the fourth quartile 10,901 steps/day. The briskness of walking, adjusted for the volume of walking, did not affect mortality. However, the number of steps/day was clearly related to mortality. When risk of mortality for those over 60 years old was set at 1.0 for the lowest quartile of steps/day, the relative risk of mortality for the second, third and fourth quartiles were 0.56, 0.45, and 0.35, respectively. For those under 60 years of age, the results were less pronounced. For those under 60 years of age, with the first quartile risk of mortality set at 1.0, the second, third and fourth quartile relative risks of mortality were 0.57, 0.42 and 0.53, respectively. Thus, use of skeletal muscles in walking has a large effect, especially among older individuals, on mortality.

===Skeletal muscle secretome alters with exercise===

Williams et al. obtained biopsies of a thigh skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis muscle) of eight 23-year old, originally sedentary, Caucasian males. Biopsies were taken both before and after a six-week long endurance exercise training program. The exercise consisted of riding a stationary bicycle for one hour, five days a week for six weeks.

Of the 13,108 genes with detected expression in the muscle biopsies, 641 genes were upregulated after endurance training and 176 genes were downregulated. Of the 817 total altered genes, 531 were identified as being in the secretome by either or both of Uniprot or Exocarta, or else by studies investigating the secretome of muscle cells. Because many of the exercise-regulated genes are identified as secreted, this indicates that much of the effect of exercise has an endocrine rather than metabolic function. The main pathways found to be affected by secreted exercise-regulated proteins were related to cardiac, cognitive, kidney and platelet functions.

==Exercise-trained effects are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms==

Between 2012 and 2019, at least 25 reports indicated a major role of epigenetic mechanisms in skeletal muscle responses to exercise. Epigenetic alterations often occur by adding methyl groups to cytosines in the DNA or removing methyl groups from the cytosines of DNA, especially at CpG sites. Methylations of cytosines can cause the DNA to be compacted into heterochromatin, thus inhibiting access of other molecules to the DNA. Epigenetic alterations also often occur through acetylations or deacetylations of the histone tails within chromatin. DNA in the nucleus generally consists of segments of 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around eight tightly connected histones (and each histone also has a loose tail) in a structure called a nucleosome and one segment of DNA is connected to an adjacent DNA segment on a nucleosome by linker DNA. When histone tails are acetylated, they usually cause loosening of the DNA around the nucleosome, leading to increased accessibility of the DNA.

===Exercise-induced regulation of genes in muscles===

Gene expression in muscle is largely regulated, as in tissues generally, by regulatory DNA sequences, especially enhancers. Enhancers are non-coding sequences in the genome that activate the expression of distant target genes, by looping around and interacting with the promoters of their target genes (see Figure &quot;Regulation of transcription in mammals&quot;). As reported by Williams et al., the average distance in the loop between the connected enhancers and promoters of genes is 239,000 nucleotide bases.

===Exercise-induced alteration to gene expression by DNA methylation or demethylation===

Endurance muscle training alters muscle gene expression by epigenetic DNA methylation or de-methylation of CpG sites within enhancers.

In a study by Lindholm et al., twenty-three individuals who were about 27 years old and sedentary volunteered to have endurance training on only one leg during 3 months. The other leg was used as an untrained control leg. The training consisted of one-legged knee extension training for 3 month (45 min, 4 sessions per week). Skeletal muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis (a thigh muscle) were taken both before training began and 24 hours after the last training session from each of the legs. The endurance-trained leg, compared to the untrained leg, had significant DNA methylation changes at 4,919 sites across the genome. The sites of altered DNA methylation were predominantly in enhancers. Transcriptional analysis, using RNA sequencing, identified 4,076 differentially expressed genes.

The transcriptionally upregulated genes were associated with enhancers that had a significant decrease in DNA methylation, while transcriptionally downregulated genes were associated with enhancers that had increased DNA methylation. Increased methylation was mainly associated with genes involved in structural remodeling of the muscle and glucose metabolism. Enhancers with decreased methylation were associated with genes functioning in inflammatory or immunological processes and in transcriptional regulation.

===Exercise-induced long-term alteration of gene expression by histone acetylation or deacetylation===

As indicated above, after exercise, epigenetic alterations to enhancers alter long-term expression of hundreds of muscle genes. This includes genes producing proteins secreted into the systemic circulation, many of which may act as endocrine messengers. Six sedentary, about 23 years old, Caucasian males provided vastus lateralis (a thigh muscle) biopsies before entering an exercise program (six weeks of 60-minute sessions of riding a stationary cycle, five days per week). Four days after this exercise program was completed, the expression of many genes was persistently epigentically altered. The alterations altered acetylations and deacetylations of the histone tails located in the enhancers controlling the genes with altered expression.

Up-regulated genes were associated with epigenetic acetylations added at histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) of nucleosomes located at their enhancers. Down-regulated genes were associated with the removal of epigenetic acetylations at H3K27 in nucleosomes located at their enhancers (see Figure &quot;A nucleosome with histone tails set for transcriptional activation&quot;). Biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle showed expression of 13,108 genes at baseline before the exercise training program. Four days after the exercise program was completed, biopsies of the same muscles showed altered gene expression, with 641 genes up-regulated and 176 genes down-regulated. Williams et al. identified 599 enhancer-gene interactions, covering 491 enhancers and 268 genes (multiple enhancers were found connected to some genes), where both the enhancer and the connected target gene were coordinately either upregulated or downregulated after exercise training.

<text>Santo Luigi Cilauro (born 25 November 1961) is an Australian comedian, television and feature film producer, screenwriter, actor, author and cameraman who is also a co-founder of &quot;The D-Generation&quot;. Known as the weatherman in &quot;Frontline&quot;, he is also an author and former radio presenter on Triple M, and achieved worldwide fame with the viral video &quot;Elektronik Supersonik&quot;.

==Early life==
Cilauro was born in 1961 in Melbourne, Australia to parents of Italian descent. Cilauro attended Xavier College and the University of Melbourne and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws in 1987.

In 1984, while walking to his aunt&#x27;s house in Melbourne, he stumbled across a Juventus press conference during their tour of Australia, and after seeing coach Giovanni Trapattoni struggle to answer questions in English, used his Italian skills to translate, which resulted in Cilauro becoming the team translator for the rest of the tour.

==Italian Studies==
In 2021, Cilauro became the patron of the Australasian Centre of Italian Studies.

==Acting and production work==
Cilauro started collaborating with Rob Sitch and Tom Gleisner in comedy theatre productions and tours. He is one of the co-founders of &quot;The D-Generation&quot;.

Cilauro wrote for, and performed in, the troupe&#x27;s show during its 1986–87 run on ABC TV (which also led to the album &quot;The Satanic Sketches&quot;). Cilauro continued as a member of the D-Gen when the team hosted their &quot;Breakfast Show&quot; on Triple M radio (1986–1992), appearing as the simple-minded &quot;Wayne from St Albans&quot; and &quot;Gino Tagliatoni&quot; amongst other roles. Cilauro was a writer/performer on the D-Generation&#x27;s 1992–1993 sketch comedy &quot;The Late Show&quot;, appearing on such segments as &quot;Graham &amp; the Colonel&quot;, &quot;The Oz Brothers&quot; and &quot;Jeff &amp; Terry Bailey&quot;.

After the second and last season of &quot;The Late Show&quot;, Cilauro starred as Stix in the 1994 ABC cop show satire &quot;Funky Squad&quot;, which he also co-created and served as one of the writer/producer/directors. He went on to help set up the Working Dog production company and was one of the writer/producer/directors of &quot;Frontline&quot; (1994–97), in which he also had a recurring onscreen role as weatherman Geoffrey Salter. Since then, Cilauro has co-written Working Dog&#x27;s popular films &quot;The Castle&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Dish&quot; (2000) and appeared as a regular member (and occasional host) of the 1998–2003 Network 10 programme &quot;The Panel&quot;.

Cilauro has been an executive producer of several Working Dog productions, including &quot;The Panel&quot;, &quot;A River Somewhere&quot; (1997–98), and &quot;All Aussie Adventures&quot; (2001–02). He played the Head of Market Research, Theo Tsolakis, on &quot;The Hollowmen&quot; (2008), a series which Cilauro co-wrote and co-produced. Cilauro also played IT technician Griffin on the Shaun Micallef sitcom &quot;Welcher &amp; Welcher&quot; (2003) and K2 on the 1996 Working Dog radio sketch &quot;Johnny Swank&quot;.

During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, he hosted a nightly comedy/variety show called &quot;Santo, Sam and Ed&#x27;s Cup Fever!&quot; live from Melbourne alongside Ed Kavalee and Sam Pang.
In 2014 Cilauro joined his Working Dog colleagues Sitch and Gleisner to stage the group&#x27;s first play, &quot;The Speechmaker&quot;.

==Zladko Vladcik==
Cilauro, along with Rob Sitch and Tom Gleisner, created the popular Internet phenomenon character Zladko &quot;ZLAD!&quot; Vladcik, a Molvanian synth-pop musician. Zlad was performed by Cilauro to accompany the Jetlag Travel Guide to Molvanîa. Cilauro was, with Sitch and Gleisner, co-author of the Jetlag Travel Guides to Molvanîa, Phaic Tăn and San Sombrèro.

Two music videos were performed by Cilauro as Zladko, for &quot;Elektronik – Supersonik&quot; and &quot;I Am The Anti-Pope&quot;.

<text>Hopkinton is a town in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States, west of Boston. The town is best known as the starting point of the Boston Marathon, held annually on Patriots&#x27; Day each April, and as the headquarters for the Dell EMC corporation.

At the 2020 census, the town had a population of 18,758. The U.S. Census recognizes the central village within the town as a census-designated place, with a population of 2,651 at the 2020 census. Hopkinton also includes the village of Woodville, which was established as a historic district in 2005.

==History==
The Town of Hopkinton was incorporated on December 13, 1715. Hopkinton was named for an early colonist of Connecticut, Edward Hopkins, who left a large sum of money to be invested in land in New England, the proceeds of which were to be used for the benefit of Harvard University. The trustees of Harvard purchased 12,500 acres of land from the Native American residents with money from the fund and incorporated the area, naming it in honor of its benefactor.

Grain was the first production crop grown in the area, while fruit and dairy industries were developed later. Agriculture predominated until 1840 when the boot and shoe industries were introduced into the town. By 1850 eleven boot and shoe factories were established in Hopkinton. Fires in 1882 and the migration of those industries to other parts of the country eliminated these industries from Hopkinton.

There are 215 Hopkinton properties listed in the State Register of Historic Places. The majority, 187, are located within the Cedar Swamp Archaeological District in Hopkinton and Westborough. The properties are also listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Twenty-three properties are included within the Hopkinton Center Historic District, a local historic district which comprises properties around the Town Common, on East Main St. and the south side of Main St. The district was expanded in 2000 to include the Town Hall and in 2001 to include Center School. The Hopkinton Supply Company Building on Main St., located slightly west of the district, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Former factory worker housing in the center of town, contrasted against the more rural areas surrounding it, are visual reminders of Hopkinton&#x27;s past.

In 2005, the town established a second historic district in the village of Woodville. The Woodville Historic District Commission was formed the same year. Ninety-seven properties are included within this district. The village of Woodville has retained its distinctive village atmosphere and strong architectural connection to Hopkinton&#x27;s industrial development and growth from the mid-to-late 19th century. The area was an early cotton clothmaking center and the site of a major shoe factory. When Boston seized Lake Whitehall for its water supply in 1894, the factories along its shores were closed or moved to other sites, as they were considered sources of pollution. Remaining factories and other buildings were destroyed in a fire in 1909. In the 18th century, it was an agricultural area with a few farms scattered north of the much smaller Lake Whitehall and its accompanying cedar swamp, and was the site of a grist mill on Whitehall Brook as early as 1714.

Within or near the Miscoe-Warren-Whitehall Watersheds ACEC (Area of Critical Environmental Concern), remains of large pits have been found. The pits were lined with bark by the Native Americans and used to store corn over the winter months.

At one time, it was believed that the waters flowing from the large swamp south of Pond St., under Pond St. and into Lake Whitehall contained magical healing powers. As a result, the area quickly was built up as a resort area. Visitors came by stagecoach to the Hopkinton Hotel, which was located between Pond St. and the lake. The mineral baths and their powers lured the visitors to the area. The baths can still be viewed by the edge of the stream that drains from the swamp. Within the ACEC area are also two beehive shaped stone structures, about tall. Their origin and use are unknown.

Hopkinton gains national attention once a year in April as it hosts the start of the Boston Marathon, a role the town has enjoyed since 1924. The town takes pride in its hospitality as runners from all over the world gather in Hopkinton to begin the run to Boston. It is also a sister city of Marathon, Greece.

==Government==
Since its incorporation in 1715, Hopkinton has retained its original Open Town Meeting form of government. The town&#x27;s day-to-day affairs had been directly overseen by an elected Board of Selectmen until 2007, when the Town&#x27;s Charter Commission created a Town Manager position with more discretion, although the Town Manager still reports to the Select Board.

===Annual Town Meeting===
Hopkinton&#x27;s Annual Town Meeting begins on the first Monday in May, hosted at the Hopkinton Middle School or High School. The meeting only begins when a quorum is formed, with 128 registered Hopkinton voters in attendance. It continues on consecutive evenings, usually three nights in total, until all articles in the Town Meeting Warrant have been voted upon.

====Warrant====
The Town Meeting Warrant is a document composed of the articles to be voted upon. Any elected or appointed board, committee, or town officer, or ten petitioning voters, may request that an article be included on the warrant. Each article to be voted upon is directed by the Select Board to an appropriate board or committee to hear and provide the original motion at Town Meeting. All articles which require expending of funds are directed to the Finance Committee; articles dealing with planning and zoning to the Planning Board; articles relating to by-laws to the By-Law Committee, and so forth.

====Annual Town Election====
Hopkinton Annual Town Election is held on the third Monday in May. Polls are open 7:00am–8:00pm. All Hopkinton precincts vote at the Hopkinton Middle School.

===County government===
Massachusetts has 14 counties which were regional administrative districts before the Revolutionary War. In 1997, the county governments of Middlesex, Berkshire, Essex, Hampden and Worcester were abolished. Many of their functions were turned over to state agencies.

Its county seats are Cambridge and Lowell.

==Library==
The Hopkinton Public Library was founded in 1867. It has been located in the heart of downtown, just steps away from the Town Common, since 1895. Until 1955, bequests were the only source of funding for the library. Since that time, the town government has been appropriating public funds for employee salaries, cost of cleaning the Library, utilities and assistance with the purchase of books. The library is now funded through various sources that include the Town Government, The McGovern Trust Fund, Annual State Aid and Friends of the Library.

The town library was established by the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association in 1867. Seven members served as the Trustees, incorporated the Library and adopted by-laws for the government of the Library in 1890. The current building was built in 1895 with contributions from local and former residents of Hopkinton. The second floor was used as a lecture hall and was remodeled later as a children&#x27;s room. A gallery was built to connect the Library building with the adjacent Episcopal Church after extensive renovation in 1967. This new section was named after the head librarian at the time, Mrs. Betty Strong. A special feature of the reading room is a stained glass window with a motif of water fountain bubbling water flowing over an open book and the inscription on the page reads &quot;The fountain of wisdom flows through books.&quot; The large hall clock that still stands near the circulation desk was presented to the Library by Mrs. F.V. Thompson and Mr. Abram Crooks.

The library was transferred to the town government in May 2010. Five members were appointed as the Library Trustees. Starting from May 2011, elections have been held annually for the members of the Library Board according to the new town charter.

In January 2016, the library announced they would make renovations to the building and moved to a temporary location at 65 South Street while the historic building on Main Street undergoes a major renovation and expansion.

In October 2017, the renovated and expanded library reopened in its downtown location at 13 Main Street.

==Education==
===Public schools===
The Town of Hopkinton has a public school system which serves students from pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. Kindergarten students and first-graders attend Marathon Elementary School. Grades 2 and 3 attend Elmwood School. Grades 4 and 5 attend Hopkins School. Grades 6 through 8 attend Hopkinton Middle School. Grades 9 through 12 attend Hopkinton High School. The town also has an integrated preschool currently located in the Marathon Elementary School building.

Hopkinton offered a fee-based full-day kindergarten option for the first time during the 2010–2011 school year via a lottery system. Free full-day Kindergarten was made available to all Kindergarten students starting in the 2014–2015 school year. Hopkinton Public Schools does not offer any foreign language education before Grade 7.

Since residents approved the Center School Feasibility Study in May 2008, Hopkinton had been involved in an Elementary School Building Project with the Massachusetts School Building Authority. The solution approved unanimously by the Hopkinton Elementary School Building Committee and the MSBA was to build a new K–5 Elementary School on the town-owned Fruit Street property and then decommission the aging Center School. Residents voted down the new school at the March 21, 2011, Special Town Meeting and again at a Special Town Election on March 28, 2011.

In May 2013 voters approved funding a new Center School Feasibility Study. The solution proposed by the new Elementary School Building Committee was to build a new Preschool, Kindergarten and Grade 1 School at 135 Hayden Rowe Street (Route 85), on property newly purchased by the town for this purpose. This proposal was approved by voters at a November 2015 Special Town Meeting. The new Marathon Elementary School, named after a public town survey, is located on Route 85 in Hopkinton, and opened for the fall 2018 school year.

Hopkinton High&#x27;s school mascot is the Hiller &quot;H&quot;, as the sports teams are known as the Hopkinton Hillers. Previously the teams were known as the Hopkinton Stonethrowers. The school primary colors are green and white, with orange as a secondary color.

<text>The Li River or Li Jiang () is the name for the upper reaches of the Gui River in northeastern Guangxi, China. It is part of the Xijiang River system in the Pearl River basin, flowing from Xing&#x27;an County to Pingle County.

==Background==
The Li River originates in the Mao&#x27;er Mountains in Xing&#x27;an County and flows in the general southern direction through Guilin, Yangshuo and Pingle. In Pingle, the Li merges with the Lipu and Gongcheng, becoming the Gui, and in turn falls into the Xijiang, the western tributary of the Pearl River. 

The upper course of the Li River is connected by an ancient Lingqu canal with the Xiang River, which flows north into the Yangtze; this in the past made the Li and Gui Rivers part of a highly important waterway connecting the Yangtze valley with the Pearl delta.

The course of the Li and Gui Rivers is flanked by green hills. Cormorant fishing is often associated with the Lijiang.

Cruises on the Li are famous, attracting millions of visitors per year.

==Geology==

The Li and its tributaries drain the area from Guilin to Yangshuo, descending from at Guilin to at Yangshuo. Mean flow past Guilin is 215 cubic meters per second, and alluvium sediments consisting of well-sorted gravels covered by silty sand, forming floodplains and terraces along its route. Yet, it is the of Devonian and Carboniferous limestones and karst terrain within the Guilin basin, that gives the area a dramatic landscape. Two distinctive types of karst are found, Fengcong, and Fenglin, which have evolved for the past 10-20 million years, within the Cenozoic.
Fengcong karst dominates the course of the Li River and is defined as a group of limestone hills with a common limestone base, with deep depressions (or &quot;dolines&quot;) between the peaks, and sometimes described as peak cluster depression karst. Hundreds of caves are present in this terrain, with 23 having passages longer than -1 km alongside the Li River gorge. The longest is the Guanyan Cave System which extends from Caoping to Nanxu.

Fenglin dominates the area around Yangshuo and south of Guilin and is defined as isolated limestone hills separated by a flat limestone surface generally covered by loose sediments, and sometimes described as a peak forest plain. The best-known fenglin is the tower karst around Yangshuo. These towers consist of strong and massive limestone forming near vertical sides with base diameters less than 1.5 times their height. The heights of the towers range from 30 to 80 m in the central basin but can be as high as 300 m near the Fengcong. Fenglin evolves from Fengcong by slow and continuous tectonic uplift, associated with the Himalayan orogenic zone, and even slower erosion of the towers.

Famous show caves in the Guilin area include the Qixing Dong and the Luti Dong.

==Notable features==

#Reed Flute Cave: a limestone cave with a large number of stalactites, stalagmites, stalacto-stalagmites, rocky curtains, and cave corals.
#Seven-Star Park: the largest park in Guilin.
#Mountain of Splendid Hues: a mountain consisting of many layers of variously colored rocks.
#Elephant-Trunk Hill: a hill that looks like a giant elephant drinking water with its trunk. It is a symbol of the city of Guilin.
#Lingqu Canal: dug in 214 BC, is one of ancient China&#x27;s three big water conservation projects and the oldest existing canal in the world.
#Other attractions include Duxiu Peak, Nanxi Park, the Taohua River, the Giant Banyan, and the Huashan-Lijiang National Folklore Park.

The imagery of the Li River is featured in the fifth series of the 20 yuan note.

<text>John Russell Colvin (29 May 1807 – 9 September 1857) was a British administrator of the East India Company, and Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces from 1853 until his death from cholera during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

==Biography==

Colvin was born in Calcutta, then part of the Bengal Presidency, the second son and fourth child of James Colvin (born 1768), a merchant with Colvin, Bazett &amp; Co. of London and Calcutta. The Colvin family were a prominent Anglo-Indian family of Scottish descent. He was educated at the East India Company College in Hertfordshire, England and entered the service of the British East India Company in 1826.

In 1836 he became private secretary to Lord Auckland at the time of the First Anglo-Afghan War of 1837, and named his son after him. From 1846 to 1849, Colvin served as Commissioner of Tenasserim, in British (Lower) Burma.

In 1853 Lord Dalhousie appointed him lieutenant-governor of the North-West Provinces of India. In 1857, at the start of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Colvin was at Agra with only a weak British regiment and a native battery, not enough force to prevail against the mutineers. Colvin issued a proclamation to the &#x27;natives&#x27; that was censured at the time for its clemency, but it was similar to the approach of Sir Henry Lawrence, later followed by Lord Canning. Colvin died shortly before the fall of Delhi.

His body could not be carried out of the Agra Fort (which after the fall of the Mughals, the British establishment in India converted into a military garrison). The selection of the burial location is often criticized for the insensitivity, considering the significance of the place. Within the sprawling palace-fort complex, the tomb is located in the front of the Diwan-i-Am (Hall of Public Audience) where the Peacock Throne was placed.

==Family==
Colvin married Emma Sophia, daughter of Wetenhall Sneyd, a vicar in England; they had ten children, many of whom continued the family connection with India. Bazett Wetenhall, Elliott Graham, and Walter Mytton all passed distinguished careers in India, and a fourth, Clement Sneyd, C.S.I., was secretary of the public works department of the India Office in London. The third son, Auckland, named after Lord Auckland, was lieutenant-governor of the North-West Provinces and Oudh, and also served in Egypt. He co-founded the Colvin Taluqdars&#x27; College in Lucknow; he also published a biography of his father in the Rulers of India series in 1895, and in 1905 gave a stained glass East window to the church of St. Mary at Soham, both as a thanksgiving for the termination of the Second Boer War, and as a permanent memorial to his father.

Colvin&#x27;s elder brother, Bazett David, in 1847 inherited their father&#x27;s estate at The Grove, Little Bealing, near Ipswich, which thus became the childhood home of Sidney Colvin, who grew up to be a critic, curator, and great friend of Robert Louis Stevenson.

Colvin&#x27;s granddaughter Brenda (1897–1981) was an important landscape architect, author of standard works in the field and a force behind its professionalisation. She had no children, but another of Colvin&#x27;s grandchildren founded his own line: Clement Sneyd&#x27;s son ended up as Admiral Sir Ragnar Colvin, KBE, CB, and fathered John Horace Ragnar Colvin, the Cold War diplomat. The most recent generation is the Australian journalist Mark Colvin and Major General James Balfour CBE of the Royal Green Jackets.

<doc id="380554" wikidata="Q2580817" url="?curid=380554" title="William Tryon">
<text>Lieutenant-General William Tryon (8 June 172927 January 1788) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator who served as governor of North Carolina from 1764 to 1771 and the governor of New York from 1771 to 1777. He also served during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Regulator Movement, and the American War of Independence.

==Early life and career==
Tryon was born on 8 June 1729 at the Tryon family&#x27;s seat at Norbury Park, Surrey, the son of Charles Tryon and Lady Mary Shirley. His maternal grandfather was Robert Shirley, 1st Earl Ferrers. In 1751, Tryon enlisted in the British Army as a lieutenant in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards and was promoted to the rank of captain later that year. In 1758, Tryon was promoted to lieutenant-colonel.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
During the Seven Years&#x27; War, Tryon and his regiment were involved in the British raid on Cherbourg. They landed at Cherbourg and destroyed all military facilities. In September, they reembarked for St Malo, where the operation went smoothly until the withdrawal, when they came under intense fire from the French at the Battle of Saint Cast. Tryon was wounded in the thigh and head.

==Governor of North Carolina==
On 26 April 1764, through family connections, Tryon obtained the position of acting lieutenant governor of the Province of North Carolina. He arrived in North Carolina with his family, including a young daughter, and architect John Hawks, in early October to find that the previous governor, Arthur Dobbs, had not left. He said that he would not be leaving until May. Tryon found himself with no income (although he was Lieutenant Governor). In 1765, a house called Russelborough on the Cape Fear River near Brunswick Town was renovated to serve as Tryon&#x27;s residence while he acted as Lieutenant Governor.

Tryon assumed his position as acting governor when Dobbs died on 28 March 1765. On 10 July, the King appointed him to the office of governor. After assuming the office of governor, Tryon worked to expand the Church of England in North Carolina. There were only five Anglican clergy members in North Carolina at that time. Tryon pushed for the completion of abandoned construction projects of Anglican churches in Brunswick Town, Wilmington, Edenton, and New Bern. Tryon appointed members of the clergy for these churches and encouraged the construction of new churches, especially in rural areas.

There was strong opposition in North Carolina to the Stamp Act of 1765. When the Stamp Act Congress was held, the colonial assembly was not in session, hence delegates could not be selected to attend. Tryon refused to allow meetings of the Assembly from 18 May 1765 to 3 November 1766 to prevent the Assembly from passing a resolution in opposition to the Stamp Act. Tryon said that he was personally opposed to the Stamp Act and that he offered to pay the taxes on all stamped paper on which he was entitled to fees. Tryon requested troops to enforce the act, but instead he was informed on 25 June 1766 that the act was repealed.

Tryon also composed plans for an elaborate governor&#x27;s mansion, which would also function as a central location for government business; he worked with Hawks during 1764 and 1765 to draw up plans for an elaborate home. In December 1766, the North Carolina legislature authorized £5,000 for the building of Tryon&#x27;s mansion. Tryon told the legislature that the sum was not substantial enough for the plans he and Hawks had created; building it &quot;in the plainest manner&quot; would cost no less than £10,000 without including the outbuildings he envisioned. Hawks agreed to supervise the construction for three years and went to Philadelphia at Tryon&#x27;s behest to hire workers; Tryon said native North Carolina workers would not know how to construct such a building.

Tryon was eventually able to convince the legislature to increase taxes to help pay for the project. The unpopularity of the new taxes spawned the derogatory nickname &#x27;Tryon Palace&#x27;. In 1770, Tryon moved into the completed mansion. The house was &quot;a monument of opulence and elegance extraordinary in the American colonies.&quot; Although he accomplished some notable improvements in the colony, such as the creation of a postal service in 1769, Tryon is most noted for suppressing the Regulator Movement in western North Carolina during the period from 1768 to 1771. The uprising was caused partly by taxation imposed to pay for Tryon Palace at New Bern (which Tryon made the provincial capital) and partly by tax abuse and fraud by western officials.

Matters came to a head in May 1771, when colonial militia defeated 2,000 Regulators in the Battle of Alamance. Following the battle, Tryon ordered the execution of seven alleged Regulators, convicted by Judge Richard Henderson. Most of the men were accused of violating the Riot Act, a crime temporarily made a capital offense by the General Assembly. The executed men included James Few, Benjamin Merrill, Enoch Pugh, Robert Matear, &quot;Captain&quot; Robert Messer, Bryant Austin Sr, and one other. Six other convicted Regulators—Forrester Mercer, James Stewart, James Emmerson, Herman Cox, William Brown, and James Copeland—were pardoned by King George III and released by Tryon.

The Regulator uprising is viewed by some historians as a precursor to the American Revolution. Tryon then raised taxes again to pay for the militia&#x27;s campaign against the Regulators. Tryon&#x27;s governorship ended, and he left North Carolina on 30 June 1771. Tryon Palace was reconstructed in the 1950s using the original architectural plans drawn by John Hawks. Many years later, in an op-ed for the &quot;Rocky Mount Telegram&quot; explaining why he wanted to limit veto power for the North Carolina governor, North Carolina State Senator Roy Cooper wrote, &quot;Governor Tryon was hated as he ruled in opulent splendor from his palace.&quot;

==Governor of New York==

On 8 July 1771, Tryon arrived in the Province of New York and became its governor. In 1771 and 1772 he was successful in having the assembly appropriate funds for the quartering of British troops and also on 18 March 1772 the establishment of a militia. Funds were also appropriated for the rebuilding of New York City&#x27;s defenses. In 1772, opposition in New York was strong against the Tea Act. In December, the Sons of Liberty &quot;persuaded&quot; the tea agents to resign. Tryon proposed to land the tea and store it at Fort George.

The Sons of Liberty were opposed and Alexander McDougall said, &quot;prevent the landing, and kill [the] governor and all the council&quot;. When news of the Boston Tea Party arrived on 22 December, Tryon gave up trying to land the tea. He told London the tea could be brought ashore &quot;only under the protection of the point of the bayonet, and muzzle of cannon, and even then I do not see how consumption could be effected&quot;. In 1774, the New Yorkers dumped their own consignment of tea into the harbor. On 29 December 1773 the governor&#x27;s mansion and all its contents were destroyed by fire. The New York Assembly appropriated five thousand pounds for his losses.

==American Revolutionary War==

On 7 April 1774, Tryon departed for a trip to England, and Cadwallader Colden was the acting governor of New York in his absence. Tryon arrived back in New York on 25 June 1775 after the American Revolutionary War had begun. Isaac Sears returned in July from the Continental Congress with orders to put Tryon under arrest, but George Washington had ordered Philip Schuyler, the commander in New York, to leave Tryon alone. On 19 October 1775, he was compelled to seek refuge on the British sloop-of-war &quot;Halifax&quot; in New York Harbor. He then set up an offshore headquarters nearby on board the merchant ship &quot;Duchess of Gordon&quot;. In 1776, he dissolved the assembly and called for new elections in February. The new assembly was for independence, so Tryon dissolved it.

During the spring and summer of 1776, Tryon and New York City mayor David Mathews conspired in a miserably bungled plot to kidnap General Washington and to assassinate his chief officers. Washington&#x27;s bodyguard Thomas Hickey was involved in the plot. Hickey had been in prison for passing counterfeit money, and he bragged to his cellmate Isaac Ketcham about the kidnapping plot. Ketcham revealed it to authorities in an effort to gain his own freedom. Hickey was court-martialled and hanged for mutiny on 28 June 1776. In June, Admiral Howe arrived in New York City with the British army. Howe placed New York under martial law with James Robertson as the military commander. Tryon retained his nominal title as governor, but with little power.

In early 1777, Tryon was given the rank of major-general of the provincials. In April, he was ordered to invade Connecticut and march on the city of Danbury to destroy an arsenal there. Tryon established his headquarters at the house of a Loyalist named Joseph Dibble, at the south end of the village and near the public stores. Generals Agnew and Erskine made their headquarters in a house near the bridge, at the upper end of the main street. All the other houses in the village were quartered with British troops for the night. Tryon engaged and defeated Patriot forces under the command of General David Wooster and Benedict Arnold at the Battle of Ridgefield when attempting to return to an invasion fleet anchored in Westport. In May 1778, he was given the rank of major-general in the British army, but in America only, and also the colonelcy of the 70th Regiment of Foot. He became the commander of all British forces on Long Island.

Tryon had long advocated engaging in raids on Patriot towns, but General Henry Clinton turned down his proposals. In July 1779, he commanded a series of raids on the Connecticut coast, attacking New Haven, Fairfield, and Norwalk, burning and plundering most of Fairfield and Norwalk. His raids were intended to draw Patriot forces away from the defense of the Hudson valley. In spite of pressure from Governor Jonathan Trumbull, George Washington did not move his troops. Patriot newspapers condemned him for making war on &quot;women and children&quot;, and Clinton was also indignant about Tryon disobeying his orders. Tryon found approval of his conduct from Lord George Germain, but Clinton refused to give him any further significant commands. In September 1780, Tryon returned to his home in London. He directed the affairs of the 70th Regiment, who were still in America, and he gave directions in 1783 for the regiment to be brought back to England for disbandment. In 1782, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. In 1784, he was made the colonel of the 29th Regiment of Foot, which was stationed in Canada.

==Death==
Tryon died at his home in London on 27 January 1788 and was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Twickenham, Middlesex, England.

==Personal life==
Tryon had a daughter by Mary Stanton, whom he never married. In 1757, he married Margaret Wake, a London heiress with a dowry of 30,000 pounds. Her father, William, had been the East India Company&#x27;s Governor in Bombay from 1742–50, and had died on a ship off the Cape of Good Hope on the voyage home. Margaret was later the namesake of Wake County, North Carolina, where Raleigh is located.

==Legacy==

According to American historian Scott M. Smith, Tryon &quot;achieved a reputation as a fair, honest and capable administrator. His signature accomplishment in this vein was the improvement of the colony’s postal service, a crucial link between the important commercial centers in South Carolina and Virginia.&quot; After assuming the office of North Carolina governor in 1765, Tryon stated &quot;I shall ever think it equally my duty to preserve the People in their constitutional liberty; as to maintain inviolate the Just and necessary Rights of the Crown&quot;, a statement which Smith noted &quot;would haunt Tryon for the rest of his life.&quot;

During the Revolutionary War, Tryon&#x27;s raids in Connecticut were denounced by Patriot leaders, and president of the Continental Congress Henry Laurens wrote in 1779 that Tryon&#x27;s memory ought to be &quot;held in everlasting contempt.&quot; In 1930, business magnate John D. Rockefeller donated land in New York City to the municipal authorities, which created Fort Tryon Park. Later that year, local historian Reginald Pelham Bolton argued the park should have its name changed to &quot;Forest Hill Park&quot; because &quot;the Tryon name was distasteful for patriotic and historical reasons.&quot;

<text>The Reed Gold Mine is located in Midland, Cabarrus County, North Carolina, and is the site of the first documented commercial gold find in the United States. It has been designated a National Historic Landmark because of its importance and listed on the National Register of Historic Places

==History==

In 1799, Conrad Reed, the son of farmer and former Hessian soldier John Reed (né Johannes Reidt) born June 6, 1757, found a 17-pound yellow &quot;rock&quot; in Little Meadow Creek on the family farm in Cabarrus County, North Carolina. For three years, the rock served as a bulky doorstop. In 1802, a jeweler from Fayetteville identified the rock as a large gold nugget. He told John Reed to name his price. Reed, not understanding the true value of gold, asked for what he thought was the hefty price of $3.50, or a week&#x27;s worth of wages. The large nugget&#x27;s true value was around $3,600.

About 1803, John Reed organized a small gold mining operation. Soon afterward a slave named Peter found a 28-pound nugget. Reed continued with placer mining for a number of years. In 1831 he began underground mining. John Reed died at age 88 on May 28, 1845, rich from the gold found on his property.

Some years later, the American Civil War decreased mining activity because of labor and resources being pulled into the war. The last large nugget uncovered by placer mining was discovered in 1896. The last underground mining took place at the Reed Mine in 1912. To handle the large amount of gold found in the region and state from the 19th into the early 20th century, the Charlotte Mint was built in nearby Charlotte, North Carolina.

Today, the Reed Mine is a state historic site that belongs to the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources and open to the public. Visitors can tour a museum with extensive displays about North Carolina gold mining. In addition, they can explore several hundred feet of restored gold mine tunnels.

==About John Reed==
Johannes Reith, a Hessian soldier from Raboldshausen, Germany, served during the American Revolution in Company C (Col. Friedrich von Porbeck) of the Garrison Regiment von Wissenbach. On June 21, 1782 he deserted his post outside Savannah, Georgia and took his arms and equipment. He left the British army and came to settle in the lower part of North Carolina.

He went to &#x27;upper&#x27; Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, later Cabarrus County, where he settled in the ethnic German community. He Anglicized his name to John Reed. Later he married Sarah Kiser, daughter of Peter Kiser and Fanny Garmon.

<doc id="380557" wikidata="Q240576" url="?curid=380557" title="Edmondo De Amicis">
<text>Edmondo De Amicis (; 21 October 1846 – 11 March 1908) was an Italian novelist, journalist, poet, and short-story writer. His best-known book is the children&#x27;s novel &quot;Heart&quot;.

==Early career==
Born in Oneglia (today part of the city of Imperia), he went to the Military Academy of Modena, and became an Army officer in the new Kingdom of Italy. Edmondo fought in the battle of Custoza during the Third Italian War of Independence, a defeat of Savoy forces against the Austrian Empire; the spectacle left him disappointed, and contributed to his later decision to leave military life.

In Florence, he wrote his first sketches dealing with his frontline experience, collected as &quot;La vita militare&quot; (&quot;Military Life&quot;, 1868), and first published by the journal of the Ministry of Defense, &quot;L&#x27;Italia Militare&quot;. In 1870, he joined the staff of the journal &quot;La Nazione&quot; in Rome, and his correspondence at the time later served as base for his travel writings: &quot;Spagna&quot; (1873), &quot;Olanda&quot; (1874), &quot;Ricordi di Londra&quot; (1874), &quot;Marocco&quot; (1876), &quot;Constantinople&quot; (1878), &quot;Ricordi di Parigi&quot; (1879). A new edition of &quot;Costantinople&quot;, considered by many his masterpiece and the best description of the city in the 19th century, was published in 2005, with a foreword by Umberto Eco.

==&quot;Heart&quot; success==

&quot;Heart&quot; was issued by Treves on 17 October 1886, then the first day of school in Italy. Its success was immense: in a few months it was printed in 40 Italian editions and translated into dozens of languages. Its praise for the creation of the united Italian state in the previous decade contributed to its reception, but also led to criticism from some Roman Catholic politicians for failing to depict the nature of the Holy See&#x27;s opposition to the annexation of Rome.

Initiated to the Scottish Rite Freemasonry, possibly in the regular Masonic Lodge &quot;Concordia&quot; in Montevideo, Uruguay, De Amicis held the public greeting speech in honor of the mason Giovanni Bovio during the first representation of his theatral drama titled &quot;San Paolo&quot;, interpreted by the Italian actor and mason Giovanni Emanuel. His book &quot;Cuore&quot; has been considered for decades an educative textbook largely read and studied in the Italian public schools. Some literary critics noted it substituted the traditional Roman Catholic doctrine with a lay civil religion where heroes took the place of Christian martyrs, the Statuto Albertino displaced the Gospels, the Church, its believers and the Ten Commandments were respectively deleted in favour of the State, the figure of the citizen and the protection of the Italian codes of laws. The Grand Orient of Italy recognized De Amicis as one of his most notable past members.

==Later years==
The nationalist message visible in De Amicis&#x27; works was soon fused with a commitment to socialism (a trend visible within &quot;Heart&quot;). In 1896, he adhered to the Italian Socialist Party. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1901.

His later works include: &quot;Sull&#x27;oceano&quot; (1889), dealing with the plight of Italian emigrants overseas, &quot;Il romanzo di un maestro&quot; (1890), &quot;Amore e ginnastica&quot; (1891), &quot;Maestrina degli operai&quot; (1895), &quot;La carrozza di tutti&quot; (1899), &quot;L&#x27;idioma gentile&quot; (1905), and &quot;Nuovi ritratti letterari e artistici&quot; (1908). At the same time, he contributed to the Turin-based &quot;Il Grido del Popolo&quot; - his articles were collected as &quot;Questione sociale&quot; (&quot;Social Issues&quot;, 1894).

De Amicis died in Bordighera at the &quot;Hotel de la Reine&quot;, which he chose because it was George MacDonald&#x27;s Casa Coraggio, Bordighera. His last years were marked by tragedy and spent in reclusion; he was marked by his mother&#x27;s death, and the frequent conflicts with his wife - ultimately, these were the source of an even greater emotional shock for De Amicis, as they led to his son Furio&#x27;s suicide (as schoolchildren, Furio and his brother Ugo had served as inspiration for &quot;Heart&quot;).

==Legacy==
Alberto Brambilla of Sorbonne University wrote that &quot;historians of Italian literature consider him a “minor author&quot; but that the publication of &quot;Constantinople&quot; was evidence that he was &quot;one best-known Italian authors abroad&quot;.

<text>Franklin Story Musgrave (born August 19, 1935) is an American physician and a retired NASA astronaut. He is a public speaker and consultant to both Disney&#x27;s Imagineering group and Applied Minds in California. In 1996, he became only the second astronaut to fly on six spaceflights, and he is the most formally educated astronaut with six academic degrees. Musgrave is the only astronaut to have flown aboard all five Space Shuttles.

==Early life==
Musgrave was born August 19, 1935, the son of Percy Musgrave Jr. (1903–1973) and Marguerite Warton Musgrave (née Swann; 1909–1982). He grew up in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, but considers Lexington, Kentucky, to be his hometown.

Musgrave has strong New England ancestral roots, descending from &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers John Howland and John Tilley, as well as early Watertown, Massachusetts, settler Richard Saltonstall. Saltonstall&#x27;s uncle was Richard Saltonstall, Lord Mayor of London.

His 4th great-grandfather was William Gray, a lieutenant governor of Massachusetts from 1810 to 1812 and a Massachusetts State Representative and Senator. His first cousin, four times removed was Horace Gray, Massachusetts Supreme Court Justice from 1864 to 1882 and United States Supreme Court Justice from 1882 to 1902.

His name comes from his 2nd great-grandfather, Franklin Howard Story Jr. (1825–1900) and 3rd great-grandfather, Franklin Howard Story (1795–1871). His 4th great-grandfather, Elisha Story (1743–1805), was a participant in the Boston Tea Party in 1773. Another son of Elisha, Joseph Story (Musgrave&#x27;s 4th great-uncle) was a United States Congressman from Massachusetts and a United States Supreme Court Justice from 1812 to 1845. Joseph&#x27;s son (Musgrave&#x27;s 1st cousin, four times removed) was artist and sculptor William Wetmore Story. William&#x27;s son (Musgrave&#x27;s second cousin, thrice removed) was painter Julian Russell Story.

Musgrave attended Dexter School in Brookline, Massachusetts, and St. Mark&#x27;s School in Southborough, Massachusetts, from 1947 to 1953. He dropped out of St. Mark&#x27;s in his senior year when a car accident &quot;caused him to miss a substantial amount of vital pre-graduation exam schooling.&quot;

==Career==
After leaving high school, Musgrave enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1953. He served as an aviation electrician, instrument technician and aircraft crew chief while completing duty assignments in Korea, Japan and Hawaii, and aboard the carrier in the Far East. Musgrave&#x27;s aviator brother Percy (1933–1959), who also served on USS &quot;Wasp&quot;, died on a mission when the carrier &quot;ran over him&quot; after a takeoff crash.

Although he did not qualify as a pilot until completing his stipulated astronaut training, Musgrave has flown 17,700 hours in 160 different types of civilian and military aircraft, including 7,500 hours in jet aircraft. He has earned FAA ratings for instructor, instrument instructor, glider instructor, and airline transport pilot in addition to astronaut wings. An accomplished parachutist, he has made more than 800 free falls, including over 100 experimental free-fall descents involved with the study of human aerodynamics.

While serving in the Marines, he completed his GED. Following his discharge, Musgrave received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and statistics from Syracuse University in 1958. Following his graduation from Syracuse University, Musgrave was briefly employed as a mathematician and operations analyst by the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, New York in 1958.

He went on to receive a Master of Business Administration degree in operations analysis and computer programming from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1959, a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry from Marietta College in 1960, and a Doctor of Medicine degree from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1964. 

Upon completing his medical degree, he served a surgical internship at the University of Kentucky Medical Center from 1964 to 1965. He continued there as a United States Air Force postdoctoral fellow (1965–1966), working in aerospace medicine and physiology, and as a National Heart Institute postdoctoral fellow (1966–1967), teaching and researching cardiovascular and exercise physiology. In 1966, he earned a Master of Science degree in physiology and biophysics from the University of Kentucky. From 1967 to 1989, he practiced clinical medicine on a part-time basis at Denver General Hospital (presently known as Denver Health Medical Center) and served as an adjunct instructor of physiology and biophysics at the University of Kentucky Medical Center. He earned a Master of Arts degree in literature from the University of Houston–Clear Lake in 1987.

He has written or been listed as a co-author of twenty-five scientific papers in the areas of aerospace medicine and physiology, temperature regulation, exercise physiology, and clinical surgery.

==NASA ==
Musgrave was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967 as a member of NASA Astronaut Group 6. After completing flight and academic training, he worked on the design and development of the Skylab Program. In 1973, he was the backup Science Pilot for Skylab 2, becoming the first Group 6 astronaut to receive a potential flight assignment.

Musgrave participated in the design and development of all Space Shuttle extra-vehicular activity equipment, including spacesuits, life support systems, airlocks and Manned Maneuvering Units. From 1979 to 1982, and 1983 to 1984, he was assigned as a test and verification pilot in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory at JSC.

Musgrave served as a CAPCOM for the second and third Skylab missions, STS-31, STS-35, STS-36, STS-38 and STS-41. He was a mission specialist on STS-6 (1983), STS-51-F/Spacelab-2 (1985), STS-33 (1989), STS-44 (1991), and STS-80 (1996); and the payload commander on STS-61 (1993).

A veteran of six space flights, Musgrave has spent a total of 1,281 hours, 59 minutes, 22 seconds on space missions, including nearly 27 hours of EVA.

Musgrave is the only astronaut to have flown on all five Space Shuttles. Prior to John Glenn&#x27;s return to space in 1998, Musgrave held the record for the oldest person in orbit at age 61.

He retired from NASA in 1997, after 30 years as an astronaut.

==Spaceflight experience==

===STS-6===
He first flew on STS-6, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, on April 4, 1983, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California, on April 9, 1983. During this maiden voyage of Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;, the crew performed the first Shuttle deployment of an IUS/TDRS satellite, and Musgrave and Don Peterson conducted the first Space Shuttle extra-vehicular activity (EVA) to test the new space suits and construction and repair devices and procedures. On this mission Musgrave became the first astronaut to do a spacewalk from a Space Shuttle. Mission duration was 5 days, 23 minutes, 42 seconds.

===STS-51-F===
On STS-51-F/Spacelab-2, the crew aboard &quot;Challenger&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 29, 1985, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 6, 1985. This flight was the first pallet-only Spacelab mission, and the first mission to operate the Spacelab Instrument Pointing System (IPS). It carried 13 major experiments in astronomy, astrophysics, and life sciences. During this mission, Musgrave served as the systems engineer during launch and entry, and as a pilot during the orbital operations. Mission duration was 7 days, 22 hours, 45 minutes, 26 seconds.

===STS-33===
On STS-33, he served aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, which launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 22, 1989. This classified mission operated payloads for the United States Department of Defense. Following 79 orbits, the mission concluded on November 27, 1989, with a landing at sunset on Runway 04 at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Mission duration was 5 days, 7 minutes, 32 seconds.

===STS-44===
STS-44 also launched at night on November 24, 1991. The primary mission objective was accomplished with the successful deployment of a Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite with an Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) rocket booster. In addition, the crew also conducted two Military Man in Space Experiments, three radiation monitoring experiments, and numerous medical tests to support longer duration Shuttle flights. The mission was concluded in 110 orbits of the Earth with &quot;Atlantis&quot; returning to a landing on the lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 1, 1991. Mission duration was 6 days, 22 hours, 50 minutes, 42 seconds.

===STS-61===
STS-61 was the first Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing and repair mission. Following a night launch from Kennedy Space Center on December 2, 1993, &quot;Endeavour&quot; rendezvoused with and captured the HST. During this 11-day flight, the HST was restored to its full capabilities through the work of two pairs of astronauts during a record 5 spacewalks. Musgrave performed 3 of these spacewalks, becoming the first astronaut-physician to do a spacewalk on two space missions. After having travelled 4,433,772 miles in 163 orbits of the Earth, &quot;Endeavour&quot; returned to a night landing in Florida on December 13, 1993. Mission duration was 10 days, 19 hours, 59 minutes.

===STS-80===
On STS-80, (November 19 to December 7, 1996), the crew aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; deployed and retrieved the Wake Shield Facility (WSF) and the Orbiting Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (ORFEUS) satellites. The free-flying WSF created a super vacuum in its wake in which to grow thin film wafers for use in semiconductors and the electronics industry. The ORFEUS instruments, mounted on the reusable Shuttle Pallet Satellite, studied the origin and makeup of stars.

During deorbit and landing, Musgrave stood in the cockpit and pointed a handheld video camera out the windows. In doing so, he recorded the plasma streams over the orbiter&#x27;s hull for the first time, and he is still the only astronaut to see them first-hand. In completing this mission he logged a record 278 Earth orbits and traveled over 7 million miles in 17 days, 15 hours, 53 minutes.

==Media appearances and space snakes==
Musgrave has made cameo appearances on several documentary TV programs, as well as the movie &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; (2000) as &quot;3rd CAPCOM&quot; and the TV show &quot;Home Improvement&quot; (Series 3, Episode 24, &quot;Reality Bytes&quot;). In 2012, he appeared at Chicon 7, the 70th World Science Fiction Convention, as the &quot;Astronaut Guest of Honor.&quot;
In 1995 while being interviewed for a space documentary, &quot;Sightings&quot;, Musgrave irked NASA officials and surprised his colleagues when he declared that during two of his missions he saw &quot;snakes&quot; floating around in space - a fact that he failed to officially report to NASA upon his return. 
In an interview with Omni, Musgrave mentioned seeing what he calls &quot;the snake&quot; on two flights and speculated it to be a rubber seal.

==Organizations==
He is a member of Phi Delta Theta, Alpha Kappa Psi, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Beta Gamma Sigma, the Civil Aviation Medical Association, the Flying Physicians Association, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Marine Corps Aviation Association, the National Aeronautic Association, the National Aerospace Education Council, the National Geographic Society, the Navy League, the New York Academy of Sciences, Omicron Delta Kappa, the Soaring Club of Houston, the Soaring Society of America and the United States Parachute Association.

== Personal life ==
He has seven children, one of whom is deceased. His hobbies include chess, flying, gardening, literary criticism, poetry, microcomputers, parachuting, photography, reading, running, scuba diving, and soaring.

In the early 1990s, Musgrave was stalked by Margaret Mary Ray, a schizophrenic woman who had previously served a prison sentence for stalking comedian David Letterman.

<text>The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor is an American award presented by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. annually since 1998, except for the years 2020 and 2021. Named after the 19th-century humorist Mark Twain, it is presented to individuals who have &quot;had an impact on American society in ways similar to&quot; Twain. The Kennedy Center chose Twain in recognition of his role as a controversial social commentator and his &quot;uncompromising perspective of social injustice and personal folly.&quot; A copy of Karl Gerhardt&#x27;s 1884 bust of Twain is presented in a ceremony usually in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall, during which the recipient is celebrated by his or her peers. The event is a significant fundraiser to benefit the Kennedy Center, which sells tickets as well as access to dinners and after-parties featuring the celebrities.

, 25 individuals have been awarded the award: six women and 19 men. Bill Cosby&#x27;s award was rescinded by the Kennedy Center in 2018. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no awards in 2020 or 2021.

== History ==

In 1997, Murray Horwitz brought the idea of a dedicated comedy award, on par with the Oscars, Grammy Awards or Tony Awards, to John Schreiber and Mark Krantz, partners in an entertainment firm. The original conceptualization was an award which would celebrate one comedian, unlike the Kennedy Center Honors, which were more all-encompassing, and the venue would be the White House. They took the idea to Ann Stock, then the White House social secretary. The White House was considered an inappropriate venue at the time, so the Kennedy Center was suggested. Bob Kaminsky, Peter Kaminsky and Cappy McGarr were brought onboard and Comedy Central would coproduce and broadcast the show. At this stage it was decided to name the prize after Mark Twain.

The inaugural recipient of the award was Richard Pryor. The first two years of the prize honoring Pryor and Jonathan Winters were taped and broadcast on Comedy Central. From 2000 to 2022, the award presentations were taped for broadcast on PBS. In 2023, the broadcaster for the award was CNN, and in 2024, a multi-year partnership with Netflix was announced. Carol Burnett received the award at age 80 in 2013, while the youngest recipient has been actress and comedian Tina Fey, at age 40 in 2010. The Kennedy Center&#x27;s intent is to give the award to living persons, but one recipient, George Carlin, died in 2008 before receiving his award. Carlin died five days after the official press release that he would be awarded the prize. Bill Cosby accepted his award at the Kennedy Center in 2009. He had twice refused the award, stating that he was disappointed with the profanity used in the inaugural ceremony honoring Richard Pryor. After Cosby was convicted of sexual assault in 2018, the Center stripped Cosby of his award and his 1998 Kennedy Center Honors. Mel Brooks has refused the award thrice. Robin Williams has also refused the award.

Since Carl Reiner, honorees are given the opportunity to meet the president, although some refuse. Twain had interactions with Ulysses S. Grant and Theodore Roosevelt.
McGarr, a former Kennedy Center board member who is a co-founder and co-executive producer of the Twain Prize, writes in his book that the mission of the prize is &quot;to honor the greatest contributors to American comedy of our time&quot;. Each awardee has a background in humor which has been a source of joy for many, showcased extensively on more than one occasion in more than one form, and as a part of the American comedic tradition having influenced industry and culture, is a legacy for American humorists to take inspiration from. Awardees have included a writer, an actor, a producer, a stand-up comedian and a media proprietor, among others. In awarding the prize to Lorne Michaels in 2004, a Canadian-American, McGarr explained that &quot;the Mark Twain Prize honors American humor, not necessarily American humorists&quot;.

According to a 2013 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, little is known about the selection process to receive the award. A Kennedy Center spokeswoman stated, &quot;A short list is compiled by the executive producers [of the ceremony] and presented to a group representatives from the Kennedy Center board of trustees, as well as the Kennedy Center senior management and programming staff&quot;. But McGarr stated in 2013 that &quot;there&#x27;s really no committee... It&#x27;s really a consensus decision. There&#x27;s not any single person who decides.&quot; He also added the award&#x27;s executive producers — McGarr, Mark Krantz and Peter and Bob Kaminsky — have always decided in consultation with the Kennedy Center&#x27;s chairman and president, David Rubenstein and Michael Kaiser. He also stated that the primary criteria is that &quot;to choose people who&#x27;ve had a full lifetime of making us laugh and who&#x27;ve had a great influence on the people who&#x27;ve followed them.&quot;

<doc id="380569" wikidata="Q1631981" url="?curid=380569" title="John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts">
<text>The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, commonly known as the Kennedy Center, is the national cultural center of the United States, located on the eastern bank of the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. Opened on September 8, 1971, the center hosts many different genres of performance art, such as theater, dance, classical music, jazz, pop, psychedelic, and folk music. It is the official residence of the National Symphony Orchestra and the Washington National Opera.

Authorized by the National Cultural Center Act of 1958, which requires that its programming be sustained through private funds, the center represents a public–private partnership. Its activities include educational and outreach initiatives, almost entirely funded through ticket sales and gifts from individuals, corporations, and private foundations. However, the center receives annual federal funding to pay for building maintenance and operation.

The original building, designed by architect was constructed by Philadelphia contractor John McShain, and is administered as a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution. An earlier design proposal called for a more curvy, spaceship-inspired building similar to how the Watergate complex appears today. An extension to the Durell Stone Building was designed by Steven Holl and opened in 2019.

In 1968, George London became the Kennedy Center&#x27;s first executive director (often called &quot;artistic director&quot; by the press). In 1991, Lawrence Wilker took over the newly created position of president. In 2014, Deborah Rutter became its third president and the first woman to hold that post. In 2025, President Donald Trump became the organization&#x27;s chairman.

==History==
The idea for a national cultural center dates to 1933 when First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt discussed ideas for the Emergency Relief and Civil Works Administration to create employment for unemployed actors during the Great Depression. Congress held hearings in 1935 on plans to establish a Cabinet level Department of Science, Art and Literature, and to build a monumental theater and arts building on Capitol Hill near the Supreme Court building. A 1938 congressional resolution called for construction of a &quot;public building which shall be known as the National Cultural Center&quot; near Judiciary Square, but nothing materialized.

The idea for a national theater resurfaced in 1950, when U.S. Representative Arthur George Klein of New York introduced a bill to authorize funds to plan and build a cultural center. The bill included provisions that the center would prohibit any discrimination of cast or audience. In 1955, the Stanford Research Institute was commissioned to select a site and provide design suggestions for the center. From 1955 to 1958, Congress debated the idea amid much controversy. A bill was finally passed in Congress in the summer of 1958 and on September 4, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law the National Cultural Center Act which provided momentum for the project.

This was the first time that the federal government helped finance a structure dedicated to the performing arts. The legislation required a portion of the costs, estimated at $10–25 million, to be raised within five years of the bill&#x27;s passage. Edward Durell Stone was selected as architect for the project in June 1959. He presented preliminary designs to the President&#x27;s Music Committee in October 1959, along with estimated costs of $50 million, double the original estimates of $25–30 million. By November 1959, estimated costs had escalated to $61 million. Despite this, Stone&#x27;s design was well received in editorials in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Washington Star&quot;, and quickly approved by the United States Commission of Fine Arts, National Capital Planning Commission, and the National Park Service.

The National Cultural Center was renamed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1964, following the assassination of President Kennedy.

===Fundraising===
The National Cultural Center Board of Trustees, a group President Eisenhower established on January 29, 1959, led fundraising. Fundraising efforts were not successful, with only $13,425 raised in the first three years. President John F. Kennedy was interested in bringing culture to the nation&#x27;s capital, and provided leadership and support for the project. In 1961, President Kennedy asked Roger L. Stevens to help develop the National Cultural Center, and serve as chairman of the Board of Trustees. Stevens recruited First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy as honorary chairman of the center, and former First Lady Mamie Eisenhower as co-chairman. In January 1961, Jarold A. Kieffer became the first Executive Director of the National Cultural Center, overseeing numerous fundraising efforts and assisting with the architectural plan.

The total cost of construction was $70 million. Congress allocated $43 million for construction costs, including $23 million as an outright grant and the other $20 million in bonds. Donations also comprised a significant portion of funding, including $5 million from the Ford Foundation, and approximately $500,000 from the Kennedy family. Other major donors included J. Willard Marriott, Marjorie Merriweather Post, John D. Rockefeller III, and Robert W. Woodruff, as well as many corporate donors. Foreign countries provided gifts to the Kennedy Center, including a gift of 3,700 tons of Carrara marble from Italy (worth $1.5 million) from the Italian government, which was used in the building&#x27;s construction.

===Construction===

President Lyndon B. Johnson dug the ceremonial first-shovel of earth at the groundbreaking for the Kennedy Center December 2, 1964. However, debate continued for another year over the Foggy Bottom site, with some advocating for another location on Pennsylvania Avenue. Excavation of the site got underway on December 11, 1965, and the site was cleared by January 1967.

The first performance was September 5, 1971, with 2,200 members of the general public in attendance to see a premiere of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Mass&quot; in the Opera House, while the center&#x27;s official opening took place September 8, 1971, with a formal gala and premiere performance of the Bernstein &quot;Mass&quot;. The Concert Hall was inaugurated September 9, 1971, with a performance by the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Antal Doráti. Alberto Ginastera&#x27;s opera, &quot;Beatrix Cenci&quot; premiered at the Kennedy Center Opera House September 10, 1971. The Eisenhower Theater was inaugurated October 18, 1971, with a performance of &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; starring Claire Bloom.

==Architecture==
Architect Edward Durell Stone designed the Kennedy Center. Overall, the building is high, long, and wide. The Kennedy Center features a , grand foyer, with 16 hand-blown Orrefors crystal chandeliers (a gift from Sweden) and red carpeting. The Hall of States and the Hall of Nations are both , corridors. The building has drawn criticism about its location (far away from Washington Metro stops), and for its scale and form, although it has also drawn praise for its acoustics, and its terrace overlooking the Potomac River. In her book &quot;On Architecture&quot;, Ada Louise Huxtable called it &quot;gemütlich Speer&quot;.

Cyril M. Harris designed the Kennedy Center&#x27;s auditoriums and their acoustics. A key consideration is that many aircraft fly along the Potomac River and over the Kennedy Center, as they take off and land at the nearby Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Helicopter traffic over the Kennedy Center is also fairly high. To keep out this noise, the Kennedy Center was designed as a box within a box, giving each auditorium an extra outer shell.

After the original structure was marked for expansion, a competition in 2013 selected Steven Holl Architects to undertake the design. The extension, called The REACH, opened in 2019.

===Artwork===

The plaza entrance of the Kennedy Center features two by German sculptor Jürgen Weber; created between 1965 and 1971, which were a gift to the Kennedy Center from the West German government. Near the north end of the plaza is a display of nude figures in scenes representing war and peace, called &quot;War or Peace&quot;. The piece, , depicts five scenes showing the symbolism of war and peace: a war scene, murder, family, and creativity. At the south end is &quot;America&quot; which represents Weber&#x27;s image of America (8 × 50 × 1.5 ft.). Four scenes are depicted representing threats to liberty, technology, foreign aid and survival, and free speech. It took the artist four years to sculpt the two reliefs in plaster, creating 200 castings, and another two years for the foundry in Berlin to cast the pieces. In 1994, the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Save Outdoor Sculpture! program surveyed &quot;War or Peace&quot; and &quot;America&quot; and described them as being well maintained. Another sculpture &quot;Don Quixote&quot; by Aurelio Teno occupies a site near the northeast corner of the building. King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia of Spain gave the sculpture to the United States for its Bicentennial, June 3, 1976.

==Venues==
The Kennedy Center has three main theaters: the Concert Hall, the Opera House, and the Eisenhower Theater.

===Concert Hall===

The Concert Hall, located at the south end of the center, seats 2,465 including chorister seats and stage boxes, and has a seating arrangement similar to that used in many European halls such as Musikverein in Vienna. The Concert Hall is the largest performance space in the Kennedy Center and is the home of the National Symphony Orchestra. A 1997 renovation brought a high-tech acoustical canopy, handicap-accessible locations on every level, and new seating sections (onstage boxes, chorister seats, and parterre seats). The Hadeland crystal chandeliers, given by the Norwegian government, were repositioned to provide a clearer view. Canadian organbuilder Casavant Frères constructed and installed a new pipe organ in 2012.

===Opera House===
The Opera House, in the middle, has approximately 2,347 seats. Its interior features include walls covered in red velvet, a distinctive red and gold silk curtain, given by the Japanese government, and Lobmeyr crystal chandelier with matching pendants, a gift from the government of Austria. It is the major opera, ballet, and large-scale musical venue of the center, and closed during the 2003/2004 season for extensive renovations which provided a revised seating arrangement and redesigned entrances at the orchestra level. It is the home of the Washington National Opera and the annual Kennedy Center Honors.

===Eisenhower Theater===
The Eisenhower Theater, on the north side, seats about 1,161 and is named for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who signed the National Cultural Center Act into law on September 2, 1958. It primarily hosts plays and musicals, smaller-scale operas, ballet, and contemporary dance. The theater contains an orchestra pit for up to 35 musicians that is convertible to a forestage or additional seating space. The venue reopened in October 2008, following a 16-month renovation which altered the color scheme and seating arrangements.

===Jazz===
Since its establishment in September 1971, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has showcased jazz in solo, various ensembles, and big band settings. In 1994, the Kennedy Center appointed Dr. Billy Taylor as Artistic Advisor for Jazz, and his first installation was his own radio show &quot;Billy Taylor&#x27;s Jazz at the Kennedy Center&quot;. Featuring his trio and guest artists in performance and discussion, the series ran for seven seasons on NPR. Since Taylor&#x27;s appointment in 1994, the center has initiated numerous performance programs to promote jazz on a national stage, featuring leading international artists and rising stars, including: the Art Tatum Piano Panorama, named after Dr. Taylor&#x27;s mentor; the Louis Armstrong Legacy, highlighting vocalists; the Mary Lou Williams Women in Jazz Festival, the first festival by a major institution promoting outstanding female jazz artists; Beyond Category, featuring artists whose work transcends genre; the Platinum Series, with internationally acclaimed headliners; Jazz Ambassadors with the United States Department of State, sending musicians on worldwide goodwill tours (1998–2004); the KC Jazz Club, a highly praised intimate setting; and Discovery Artists in the KC Jazz Club, highlighting up-and-coming talent. Kennedy Center and NPR annually collaborated on the beloved holiday broadcast &#x27;NPR&#x27;s Piano Jazz Christmas&#x27;, until the retirement of host Marian McPartland, and hence the show, in 2011. Since 2003, the center&#x27;s jazz programs have been regularly broadcast on NPR&#x27;s &quot;JazzSet&quot; with Dee Dee Bridgewater. Recent highlights, produced by the center, have included &quot;Great Vibes, A Salute to Lionel Hampton&quot; (1995); &quot;Billy Taylor&#x27;s 80th Birthday Celebration&quot; (2002); &quot;Nancy Wilson, A Career Celebration&quot; (2003); &quot;Michel Legrand with Patti Austin&quot;, part of the center&#x27;s Festival of France (2004); &quot;A Tribute to Shirley Horn&quot; (2004); &quot;James Moody&#x27;s 80th Birthday&quot; (2005); and &quot;Benny Golson at 80&quot; (2009). In March 2007, the center hosted a once-in-a-lifetime celebration, Jazz in Our Time, which bestowed the center&#x27;s Living Jazz Legend Award to over 30 revered artists. During Dr. Taylor&#x27;s tenure, the center has created recognized educational initiatives, including national jazz satellite distance-learning programs; adult lecture series; master classes and workshops with national artists and local metropolitan Washington, D.C. students; and Betty Carter&#x27;s Jazz Ahead—continuing the singer&#x27;s legacy of identifying outstanding young talent. In 2015, Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett performed there as part of their Cheek to Cheek Tour.

===National Symphony Orchestra (NSO)===

The National Symphony Orchestra, the Kennedy Center&#x27;s artistic affiliate since 1987, has commissioned dozens of new works, among them Stephen Albert&#x27;s &quot;RiverRun&quot;, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Music; Morton Gould&#x27;s &quot;Stringmusic&quot;, also a Pulitzer Prize-winner; William Bolcom&#x27;s Sixth Symphony, Roger Reynolds&#x27;s &quot;george WASHINGTON&quot;, and Michael Daugherty&#x27;s &quot;UFO&quot;, a concerto for solo percussion and orchestra.

In addition to its regular season concerts, the National Symphony Orchestra presents outreach, education, and pops programs, as well as concerts at Wolf Trap each year. The annual American Residencies for the Kennedy Center is a program unique to the National Symphony Orchestra and the center. The center sends the Orchestra to a different state each year for an intensive period of performances and teaching encompassing full orchestral, chamber, and solo concerts, master classes and other teaching sessions. The Orchestra has given these residencies in 20 states so far: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North and South Carolina, Oklahoma, North and South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Nevada, and Wyoming/Montana.

The NSO recording of John Corigliano&#x27;s &quot;Of Rage and Remembrance&quot; won a Grammy Award in 1996.

===Performing Arts for Everyone (PAFE)===
The Kennedy Center is the only U.S. institution that presents a free performance 365 days a year, daily at 6pm (12 noon on December 24). The Millennium Stage, created as part of the center&#x27;s Performing Arts for Everyone initiative in 1997 and underwritten by James A. Johnson and Maxine Isaacs, features a broad spectrum of performing arts, from dance and jazz, to chamber music and folk, comedy, storytelling and theater. In the past twelve years, over three million people have attended Millennium Stage performances. The Millennium Stage has presented more than 42,000 artists, which includes over 4,000 international artists from more than 70 countries; performers representing all 50 states; and 20,000 Washington-area ensembles and solo artists. The Charlie Byrd Trio and the Billy Taylor Trio were the first artists to delight audiences with a free performance on March 1, 1997. In 1999, the center began web-casting each night&#x27;s live performance, and continues to archive and maintain each event in a database of over 3,000 performances which may be accessed via the center&#x27;s website. Performing Arts for Everyone initiatives also include low- and no-cost tickets available to performances on every stage of the Kennedy Center, and several outreach programs designed to increase access to Kennedy Center tickets and performances.

====The Conservatory Project====
An initiative of the Millennium Stage, the Conservatory Project is a semi-annual event occurring in February and May that is designed to present the best young musical artists in classical, jazz, musical theater, and opera from leading undergraduate and graduate conservatories, colleges and universities.

=== Artist Residencies ===
The Kennedy Center hosts residencies for artists to collaborate with the center&#x27;s performing ensembles, programmers, and community initiatives. The center holds positions for Composer-in-Residence, Education Artist-in-Residence, and Culture Artist-in-Residence. The current artists-in-residence are The Roots, author Jacqueline Woodson, composer Carlos Simon, and pianist Robert Glasper.

===Theater===
The center has co-produced more than 300 new works of theater over the past 43 years, including Tony-winning shows ranging from &quot;Annie&quot; in 1977 to &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, and the American premiere of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. The center also produced the &quot;Sondheim Celebration&quot; (six Stephen Sondheim musicals) in 2002, &quot;Tennessee Williams Explored&quot; (three of Tennessee Williams&#x27; classic plays) in 2004, &quot;Mame&quot; starring Christine Baranski in 2006, &quot;Carnival!&quot; in 2007, August Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Pittsburgh Cycle&quot; (Wilson&#x27;s complete ten-play cycle performed as fully staged readings) and &quot;&quot; both in 2008, and a new production of &quot;Ragtime&quot; in 2009. The Kennedy Center Fund for New American Plays has provided critical support in the development of 135 new theatrical works. In 2011, a new production of &quot;Follies&quot; starring Bernadette Peters opened at the Eisenhower Theater, and transferred to Broadway that fall.

===Kennedy Center Honors===

Since 1978, the Kennedy Center Honors have been awarded annually by the center&#x27;s Board of Trustees. Each year, five artists or groups are honored for their lifetime contributions to American culture and the performing arts, including dance, music, theater, opera, film, and television.

===Mark Twain Prize for American Humor===
The Kennedy Center has awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor annually since 1998. Named after the 19th-century humorist Mark Twain, it is presented to individuals who have &quot;had an impact on American society in ways similar to&quot; Twain.

===Local performing arts organizations===
Many local arts organizations present (or have presented) their work at the Kennedy Center. Some of these include:

* American Film Institute
* The Washington Chorus
* The Cathedral Choral Society of Washington
* Choral Arts Society of Washington
* Opera Lafayette
* VSA arts
* The Washington Ballet
* Washington Concert Opera
* Washington National Opera
* Washington Performing Arts Society
* Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company
* Young Concert Artists of Washington
===Other events===
The Kennedy Center regularly hosts special Inauguration Day events and s during the start of each presidential term.

During the United States Bicentennial, the Kennedy Center hosted numerous special events throughout 1976, including six commissioned plays. The center hosted free performances by groups from each state. In December 1976, Mikhail Baryshnikov&#x27;s version of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; ballet played for two weeks.

In 1977, the Opera House hosted George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; with Rex Harrison and Elizabeth Ashley. The American Ballet Theatre has also frequently performed at the Kennedy Center. The troupe&#x27;s 2004 production of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, choreographed by Kevin McKenzie, was taped there, shown on PBS in June 2005, and released on DVD shortly after. Productions of &quot;The Lion King&quot; and Trevor Nunn&#x27;s production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (choreographed by Matthew Bourne) were presented in the 2007–2008 season, to name a few.

&quot;The Kennedy Center at 50&quot;, a concert to celebrate the center&#x27;s 50th anniversary, was held on September 14, 2021, and aired on PBS on October 1, 2021. Audra McDonald hosted, and First Lady Jill Biden gave opening remarks.

==Millennium Stage Archives==
The Kennedy Center stages free daily performances on its Millennium Stage in the Grand Foyer. Featured on the Millennium Stage are a range of art forms, including performing artists and groups.

The two theaters of The Millennium Stage are equipped with lights, sound systems, and cameras. Every free event performed at this stage is recorded and archived on the Kennedy Center&#x27;s website. These archives have been available to the public for free since 2009.

==VSA==
VSA (formerly VSA arts) is an international nonprofit organization founded in 1974 by Jean Kennedy Smith to create a society where people with disabilities learn through, participate in, and enjoy the arts. VSA provides educators, parents, and artists with resources and the tools to support arts programming in schools and communities. VSA showcases the accomplishments of artists with disabilities and promotes increased access to the arts for people with disabilities. Each year 7 million people participate in VSA programs through a nationwide network of affiliates and in 54 countries around the world. Affiliated with the Kennedy Center since 2005, VSA was officially merged into the organization in 2011 to become part of the center&#x27;s Department of VSA and Accessibility.

==Renovations and expansion==
On June 16, 1971, Congress authorized appropriations for one year to the Board of Trustees for operating and maintenance expenses. In following years, the appropriations were provided to the National Park Service for operations, maintenance, security, safety and other functions not directly related to the performing arts activities. The National Park Service and the Kennedy Center signed a cooperative agreement requiring each party to pay a portion of the operating and maintenance costs based on what proportion of time the building was to be used for performing arts functions. The agreement did not specify who was responsible for long-term capital improvement projects at the Kennedy Center, along with only periodic funding by Congress for one-time projects.

===1990–2005===
In fiscal years 1991 and 1992, Congress recommended that $27.7 million be allocated for capital improvement projects at the center, including $12 million for structural repairs to the garage and $15.7 million for structural and mechanical repairs, as well as projects for improving handicapped access. In 1994, Congress gave full responsibility to the Kennedy Center for capital improvement projects and facility management. From 1995 to 2005, over $200 million of federal funds were allocated to the Kennedy Center for long-term capital projects, repairs, and to bring the center into compliance with modern fire safety and accessibility codes. Improvements included renovation of the Concert Hall, Opera House, plaza-level public spaces, and a new fire alarm system. The renovations projects were completed 13 to 50 percent over budget, due to modifications of plans during the renovations resulting in overtime and other penalties. Renovations to the Eisenhower Theater were completed in 2008.

===2013–present===

Beginning in 2013, the center commenced with an expansion project on four acres in the center&#x27;s South Plaza. The expansion adds classroom, rehearsal, and performance space and includes three pavilions (the Welcome Pavilion, the Skylight Pavilion, and the River Pavilion), reflecting pool, a tree grove, a sloping lawn to be used for outdoor performances, and a pedestrian bridge over Rock Creek Parkway. The architect is Steven Holl, with assistance from architectural firm BNIM. Edmund Hollander Landscape Architects is the landscape architect.

Plans for the project began after David M. Rubenstein donated $50 million to the center. A groundbreaking ceremony took place in December 2014. Originally estimated to cost $100 million, the cost of the project grew to $175 million, and design changes and a major D.C. sewer project significantly delayed construction. The expansion, entitled the REACH, opened on September 7, 2019, with an opening arts festival. The fundraising goal for the new REACH expansion grew to $250 million as the project progressed, and the target was achieved just two days before opening. Since its opening, the REACH has received several design awards, such as &quot;The Architect&#x27;s Newspaper&quot;&#x27;s Best of the Year Award in the Cultural category and an Honor Award in the 2020 AIA New York Design Awards.

==Management==
Prior to 1980, daily operations of the Kennedy Center were overseen by the chairman of the board of directors, and by the board itself. Aspects of the center&#x27;s programming and operations were overseen by various other people. George London was the Kennedy Center&#x27;s first executive director (often called &quot;artistic director&quot; by the press, although that was not the formal title), serving from 1968 to 1970, while William McCormick Blair, Jr. was its first administrative director. Julius Rudel took over as music director in 1971. In 1972, Martin Feinstein replaced London and held the position of artistic director until 1980. Marta Casals Istomin was named the first female artistic director in 1980, a position she held until 1990; she was also the first person to be formally invested with that title.

In 1991, the board created the position of chief operating officer to remove the day-to-day operations of the Kennedy Center from the chairman and board. Lawrence Wilker was hired to fill the position, which later was retitled president. The artistic director continued to oversee artistic programming, under the president&#x27;s direction.

Michael Kaiser became president of the Kennedy Center in 2001. He left the organization when his contract expired in September 2014.

In September 2014, Deborah Rutter became its third president; she was the first woman to hold that post. Rutter had previously been president of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Association, a position she held from 2003. In 2015, Rutter tapped renowned arts organizations executive Robert Van Leer to assist with leadership and expansions. In February 2025, Rutter was dismissed as president of the Kennedy Center shortly after President Donald Trump was made chairman of the organization. 

===Board of Trustees===
The Kennedy Center Board of Trustees, formally known as the Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, maintains and administers the center and its site. 

The honorary chair members of the board are the First Lady and her living predecessors. Members of the board are specified by U.S. Code Title 20 Chapter 3 subchapter V §76h and include &quot;ex officio&quot; members such as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Librarian of Congress, the Secretary of State (substituting for the director of the United States Information Agency after that agency was abolished), the chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, the Superintendent of schools of the District of Columbia, the Director of the National Park Service, the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, as well as 36 general trustees appointed by the president of the United States for six-year terms.

In February 2025, President Donald Trump announced his intention to dismiss the Center&#x27;s board members and appoint himself as chairman. The Center responded by stating that while a president has the authority to replace the entire board, such a move would be an unprecedented action. They also noted that the chairman is elected by the board members themselves, and that this precedent of bipartisan governance had been maintained since the Center&#x27;s opening in 1971. On February 10, 2025, Trump named Richard Grenell to serve as interim executive director. Trump expressed concern about and criticized the Center&#x27;s drag and LGBTQ programming, vowing to be the one who decides what is allowed to be performed in the venue. Trump followed through on this threat, dismissing Board members and naming his own. On February 12, 2025, Trump&#x27;s newly selected Board of Trustees elected Trump as chair.

Following Trump&#x27;s takeover of the board, the national tour of the new children&#x27;s musical &quot;Finn&quot;, which involved coming-of-age themes and subject matter, was cancelled by the Center, with a spokesperson citing it as &quot;a purely financial decision&quot;. The public and the show&#x27;s creators criticized the move as an attack on free speech and accessibility to the performing arts, with Actors&#x27; Equity Association calling the decision &quot;beyond appalling&quot; and &quot;disturbing&quot;. Celebrities that stated that they would no longer associate with the Kennedy Center included Issa Rae, Renée Fleming, Shonda Rhimes, and Ben Folds. W. Kamau Bell did perform right after the changes. In an interview on NPR, he said &quot;Then there&#x27;s a part of me that knows my audience — specifically in times of stress and pain and controversy — actually wants to hear from me.&quot;

<text>Dazhbog (), alternatively Daždźboh (), Dazhboh (), Dažbog, Dazhdbog, Dajbog, Daybog, Dabog, Dazibogu, or Dadźbóg, was one of the major gods of Slavic mythology, most likely a solar deity and possibly a cultural hero. He is one of several authentic Slavic gods, mentioned by a number of medieval manuscripts, and one of the few Slavic gods for which evidence of worship can be found in all Slavic tribes.

Dazhbog (or Dazhboh) is mentioned in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, a history of early Kievan Rus&#x27; as one of seven gods whose statues Prince Vladimir the Great erected in front of his palace in Kiev in 980, when he came to the throne. The name is also mentioned in the Hypatian Codex, as well as in the medieval Old East Slavic epic &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign .&quot;

== Etymology ==
The Proto-Slavic reconstruction is , and is composed of *dadjь, imperative of the verb &quot;to give&quot;, and the noun &quot;god&quot;. The original meaning of &quot;Dazhbog&quot; would thus, according to Dubenskij, Ognovskij and Niederle, be &quot;giving god&quot;, &quot;god-giver, &quot;god-donor&quot;.

This word is an old compound, that is particularly interesting because it retains the old meaning of the Proto-Slavic *bogъ &quot;earthly wealth/well-being; fortune&quot;, with a semantic shift to &quot;dispenser of wealth/fortune&quot; and finally &quot;god&quot;. Due to the absence of convincing cognates in other Indo-European languages, Proto-Slavic *bogъ is often considered to be an Iranian borrowing, being related to Indo-Iranian Bhaga, or at least being semantically influenced by them; in both Slavic and Indo-Iranian cognate forms mean both &quot;deity&quot; and &quot;wealth, share&quot;. Thus, translated literally, &quot;Dazhbog&quot; would be &quot;giving god&quot;.

In other languages, Proto-Slavic: ; Church Slavic: Даждьбогъ; Old East Slavic: Дажьбогъ; , Дажбог, or Дабог; Bulgarian, Ukrainian and Дажбог, Дайбог, or Дабог; , &quot;Dażbóg&quot;, &quot;Dabóg&quot;; , Дажбог, Дайбог, or Дабог; Serbo-Croatian: &quot;Daždbog&quot; / Даждбог, &quot;Dažbog&quot; / Дажбог, &quot;Dajbog&quot; / Дајбог, or &quot;Dabog&quot; / Дабог.

== Characteristics ==

One passage about Dazhbog comes from the Hypatian Codex, a 15th-century compilation of several much older documents from the Ipatiev Monastery in Russia. The complete passage, reconstructed from several manuscripts, translates as follows:

[Then] began his reign Feosta (Hephaestus), whom the Egyptians called Svarog ... during his rule, from the heavens fell the smith&#x27;s prongs and weapons were forged for the first time; before that, [all] fought with clubs and stones. Feosta also commanded the women that they should have only a single husband ... and that is why Egyptians called him Svarog ... After him ruled his son; his name was the Sun, and they called him Dazhbog ... Sun tsar, son of Svarog. That is Dazhbog.

This is, in fact, a Slavic translation of an original Greek manuscript of Malalin from the 6th century. In the Greek text, the names of gods are Hephaestus and Helios. Apparently, the unknown Rus translator tried to re-tell the entire story (set in Egypt) by replacing the names of classical deities with those that were better known to his readers. 

One can only hope that he indeed replaced the names of Greek gods with their fitting Slavic counterparts; however, at least one issue remains problematic: in all Slavic languages, the word for Sun, &quot;Suntse&quot;, is of neutral or feminine gender, never masculine (however, there is an Old East Slavic epic character &quot;Vladimir Beautiful Sun&quot; or &quot;Vladimir Bright Sun&quot; (ru) which has the same place as Arthur in English culture). 

Also, in Baltic mythology, which is most akin to Slavic, Sun is a female deity, Saule, while the Moon is a male one. The same pattern can be observed in the folklore of many Slavic nations, where the Sun is most often identified with mother or a bride, and Moon with father or husband, their children being the stars. Where exactly this leaves Dazhbog as a possible male solar deity of Slavic pantheon remains questionable.

Furthermore, this passage has raised quite a few theories about family relations between Slavic gods. If we assume that indeed Svarog was believed to be Dazhbog&#x27;s father, the question arises of his relation with Svarozhits, another deity who is mentioned as a god of fire and war in several other medieval documents describing the pagan beliefs of Slavs. Svarozhits is simply a diminutive of Svarog&#x27;s name, i.e., &quot;little Svarog&quot;, which implicates he was considered a child of Svarog. Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov proposed a reconstruction of this mythical genealogy that Svarog, a deity of fire and forge similar to the Greek Hephaestus, had two sons; Dazhbog, who represented the fire in the sky (i.e., the Sun), and Svarozhits, who symbolised the flame on earth, in the forge. 

Henryk Łowmiański, however, theorised that Svarog was a Slavic sky god and personification of daylight sky itself, possibly a continuation of Proto-Indo-European &quot;*Dyēus Ph2ter&quot;, while Svarozhits and solar Dazhbog were the same deity, though, he concluded, two other aspects of Svarozhits also existed: fiery Svarozhits, as in the Sun (mentioned in Old East Slavic medieval manuscripts), and lunar Svarozhits, associated with the Moon. Film director and controversial amateur mythologist Franjo Ledić, on the other hand, assumed that Svarog and Dazhbog are the same god.

=== Relationship to Khors ===
Many mythologists also believe Dazhbog to be identical with another East Slavic deity with possible solar attributes, Khors. Osip Maximovich Bodjanskij based this theory on the following passage from Primary Chronicle:

And Vladimir began his reign in Kiev alone and erected idols on the hill outside his palace with porch: Perun of wood with a head of silver and moustache of gold and Khors Dazhbog and Stribog and Simargl and Mokosh.

The names Khors and Dazhbog are the only two not clearly separated by the word &quot;and&quot; in the text. It is possible this indicates a compound deity, Khors Dazhbog. On this basis, Toporov assumed that Khors could be an Iranian (possibly Sarmatian or Scythian) name for this god, and Dazhbog a Slavic one. Boris Rybakov compared Khors and Dazhbog to Helios and Apollo, respectively, concluding that both of them were solar gods, but while Khors represented the Sun itself, Dazhbog, as &quot;deus dator&quot;, rather symbolised the life-giving power of the Sun. That Khors was indeed a solar deity was deduced from the following passage in the &quot;Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;:

Vseslav the prince judged men; as prince, he ruled towns; but at night he prowled in the guise of a wolf. From Kiev, prowling, he reached, before the cocks crew, Tmutorokan. The path of great Khors, as a wolf, prowling, he crossed.

In other words, prince Vseslav reached Tmutorokan before dawn, thus crossing the path of Khors, the Sun. In the mythical view of the world, the Sun has to pass through the underworld during the night to reach the eastern horizon by the dawn. This, and the fact that prince Vseslav is transformed into a wolf during the night, while &quot;crossing the path of Khors&quot;, draws a parallel with the Serbian Dabog, who, as stated already, was believed to be a lame &quot;wolf shepherd&quot; who rules over the underworld. 

Of particular interest is the fact that Serbian folk accounts describe him as being lame; lameness was a standing attribute of Greek Hephaestus, whom, as we have seen, the Hypatian Codex compared with Slavic smith-god Svarog, father of Dazhbog. (In fact, most of Indo-European smith-gods were lame; the reason for this was most likely arsenicosis, low levels of arsenic poisoning, resulting in lameness and skin cancers. Arsenic was added to bronze to harden it, and most smiths of the Bronze Age would have suffered from chronic workplace poisoning.)

Serbian Dabog, being lord of the underworld, was also associated with precious metals, and sometimes was said to have a silver beard. Serbian scholar Veselin Čajkanović concluded that the chthonic character of Dabog in Serbian folklore fits very nicely with the solar Dazhbog mentioned in Old East Slavic sources, pointing out that in numerous mythologies, solar deities tend to have double aspects, one benevolent, associated with the Sun during the day, and the other malevolent, associated with night, when the Sun is trapped in the underworld.

In his studies of Serbian folklore, Čajkanović also concluded that many more benevolent aspects of Dazhbog were passed on to popular saints in folk Christianity, in particularly onto St. Sava, Serbian national saint, who, although undoubtedly was a real historical person, in folk tales often appears in the role of culture hero. The fact that in the &quot;Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, the Rus and their princes are being referred to as &quot;Dazhbog&#x27;s grandchildren&quot;, indicates that Dazhbog was considered as an ancestral deity, a common role of a culture hero archetype in mythologies.

== In modern culture ==

A sculpture of the god was erected in Hola Prystan, Ukraine early in 2001. Some days later, it was broken up due to the objections by the church.

On April 10, 2016, a Dazhdbog idol was installed by the Slavic pagans in a particularly revered place in the city of Astrakhan, Russia. On April 12, 2016, information about the desecration of idols and destruction all the adjacent territories had become known.

<text>Devana ( , ), Zevana (), less often Zievonia () is the goddess of wild nature, forests, hunting and the moon worshiped by the Western Slavs. In the sources, she was first mentioned in the 15th century by Jan Długosz, who compared her to the Roman goddess Diana. &quot;Dziewanna&quot; is also a Polish name for &quot;Verbascum&quot;, and the etymology of the word is unclear. After strong criticism from Aleksander Brückner, researchers rejected her authenticity, but nowadays it is accepted by an increasing number of researchers. Sometimes, in folk rituals, she performs together with Morana.

== Etymology ==
Proto-Slavic name for &quot;Verbascum&quot; is reconstructed as &quot;*divizna&quot; (cf. , Czech and , ), with secondary form as &quot;*divina&quot; (cf. , ). That word has a Proto-Balto-Slavic origin and appears in Lithuanian language as e.g. &quot;devynspė͂kė&quot;, &quot;devynjėgė&quot;. The only cognate from outside the Balto-Slavic group may be Dacian word &quot;διέσεμα&quot;/&quot;diésema&quot; (Dioscorides), which is being derived from &quot;*diu̯es-eu̯smn&quot; („burning sky”) and compared to German &quot;Himmelbrand&quot; (&quot;Verbascum&quot;; „burning heavens”), but exact etymology of Slavic word is unclear. Russian linguist and etymologist Aleksandr Anikin notes a similarity between the Lithuanian terms for &quot;Verbascum&quot; and the Lithuanian word &quot;devynì&quot; &quot;nine&quot;.

There are several interpretations of Devana&#x27;s name. The most obvious etymology are words such as &quot;dziewa&quot;, &quot;dziewka&quot;, &quot;girl, young woman, maiden&quot;, and &quot;dziewica&quot;, &quot;virgin&quot;, a word derived from the &quot;dziewa&quot;. This etymology can be supported by fact, that Diana (and Artemis – her greek equivalent) is usually depicted in myths as a virgin and has never had any offspring or a consort.

Another word, from which the name of the goddess may come from, may be the old Polish &quot;dziwy&quot;, &quot;wild&quot;.

It was also proposed to combine Devana&#x27;s name with the Proto-Indo-European god of heaven &quot;*Dyēus&quot;. Slavic folklore includes demons with a similar name, e.g. Polish and Czech dziwożona, Russian div, Bulgarian and Croatian samodiva (&quot;rusalka, boginka, the magical creature&quot;), etc. It is assumed that the feminine demons-divas derive from the Proto-Slavic word &quot;*diva&quot;, and this word is the feminine form of the word &quot;*divъ&quot; (&quot;div (demon)&quot;). &quot;*divъ&quot; is derived from the PIE. word &quot;*Dyēus&quot; (&quot;god of heaven&quot;) through the intermediate *&quot;deywós&quot; (&quot;heavenly&quot;) and its closest related word is Dievs – god of heaven in Baltic mythology. &quot;*Dyēus&quot; in the Slavs has acquired demonic characteristics as a result of cultural contacts with Iranian peoples, who have demonized the Iranian continuator of &quot;*Dyēus&quot; as a result of the Zoroastrianist reform. An argument for such an etymology is that Diana is also etymologically derived from &quot;*Dyēus&quot;. Anikin notes that &quot;Verbascum&quot; has sometimes been used to lighten hair, and combines the word with PIE. the root &quot;*dei-u̯-&quot; or &quot;*dī-&quot; (&quot;to shine, to be bright&quot;), from which also comes &quot;*Dyēus&quot;.

The suffix &quot;-ana&quot;, &quot;-anna&quot;, which occurs in the names of many goddesses, may be derived from the PIE. word &quot;*ansu&quot; meaning &quot;lord, ruler, god&quot;.

== Sources ==

The first source to mention Devana is the Czech &quot;Mater Verborum&quot; - a Latin dictionary dating back to the 13th century. The text of the dictionary can be read: &quot;Diana, Latonae et Iouis branch&quot; (&quot;Diana, daughter of Jupiter and Latona&quot;) and a Czech gloss: &quot;Devana, Letuicina and Perunova dci&quot; (&quot;Devana, daughter of Letuna and Perun&quot;). However, &quot;Mater Verborum&quot; was discovered in the 19th century by Václav Hanka, who was proved to have falsified texts on Czech history, making this source unreliable.

The main source about Devana is Jan Długosz&#x27;s &quot;Annales&quot;:
In another place he writes that when Mieszko ordered the drowning of the idols of pagan gods, &quot;this destruction and drowning of the idols is still present and renewed in some Polish villages, where they carry the images of Devana and Morena on a long stick and throw them into the swamps and sink on Laetare Sunday&quot;. However, the information of Długosz that the custom of drowning Death is a legacy of the destruction of Slavic idols by Christians is false, because this custom is already condemned in the &quot;Provincial statutes in short&quot;, which were written before Długosz&#x27;s &quot;Annales&quot; (1420s). In the &quot;Polish Chronicle&quot; a similar custom is described by Marcin Bielski:

In Poland, the goddess is also mentioned by Maciej Stryjkowski: &quot;Diana, the goddess of hunting, was called by the Sarmatians Zievonia or Devana in their language&quot;, &quot;Christ, you enlightened Mieszko who was born blind, and you brought Poland to your baptism. Grom, Ladon, Morana, Pogvizd, Zevana gave up to you&quot;. Devana is also mentioned by Miechowita, Guagnini, Kromer and priest Wujek.

Aside from Długosz, this goddess is mentioned by Oskar Kolberg in his work on Lusatia: „Dživica, goddess of forests and hunting, peculiarly in southern Sorbs. This beautiful woman with a bow and arrow has greyhounds. They also talk about someone who stayed in the forest at noon: Hladaj so, zo dživica k tebi ńepřindže. They think that she is hunting also by moonlight. Džiwi [means here] wild, and dživina [means] wildmeat.”

Devana can also be confirmed by toponymy, e.g. the Děvín peak in the , Devínska Nová Ves, or Devin – a Slavic name for Magdeburg and others.

The only potential, non-Western Slavic source is &quot;Sermon by Saint Gregory&quot;, which lists the figure of Diva alongside other gods such as Mokosh and Perun. Diva passed from Old Russian to Czech and was considered by Josef Jungmann to be another name of the goddess Lada.

== Folklore ==

Devana, apart from the sources mentioned above, does not appear directly in folklore, but some legends may point to her. Devana may be indicated by the legend of Łysa Góra, which was presented as &quot;Polish Olympus&quot; in Polish culture. According to local legends, before the monastery was built there, on Łysa Góra in pre-Christian times stood a gord (&quot;Wielkopolska Chronicle&quot;) or a castle (Długosz). According to Długosz, the castle was to be built by giants, and in the folk version by the &quot;Proud Lady&quot;, which was her seat. The Proud Lady, who was to defeat Alexander the Great, fell into pride and declared herself Diana. God did not bear it and destroyed the castle with lightning. and interpret The &quot;Proud Lady&quot; as Devana.

Later on, Devana is mentioned by the Scottish folklorist James G. Frazer in his &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, who describes a Silesian custom where the figure of Death (Marzanna) is melted or destroyed. Then, the young people go to the forest, cut down a small fir, strip away the bark and then decorate it with festoons, paper roses, pisanki, etc. The tree is called &quot;May&quot; or &quot;Summer&quot;. Then the boys walk with this tree from house to house and sing songs:

Frazer continues: &quot;Sometimes they also bring from the forest a nicely assumed doll, which they call &quot;Summer&quot;, &quot;May&quot; or &quot;Fiancée&quot;. In Poland they call her the Devana, the goddess of spring&quot;. A similar practice is described by Marcin Kromer in &quot;De origine et rebus gestis Polonorum libri XXX&quot;. In Podlasie region, the &quot;Princess&quot;, a beautiful girl dressed in colorful robes, flowers and red beads was shown around, which may be related to the Silesian custom.

In Slavic folklore there are devony () – female mountain spirits or demons living in the caves, engaged in spinning, related to the forest fleece, who may be a demonized Devana. It can be similar with dziwożony.

=== Herb ===
in Polish, &quot;dziewanna&quot; (less often &quot;dziwizna&quot;) is also the name for &quot;verbascum&quot;, used for skin care and treatment of respiratory problems. Szyjewski notes, however, that the &quot;dziewanna&quot; was sometimes called the &quot;braid of the Virgin Mary&quot;, and Kolankiewicz that in medieval iconography the Blessed Virgin Mary was sometimes depicted with the &quot;verbascum&quot; in her hand, and &quot;marzanna&quot; (name for six plants), was also a synonym for the &quot;dziewanna&quot; in the 16th century.

== Interpretations ==
The first studies on the &quot;pantheon of Długosz&quot; denied the existence of all or most of the gods he mentioned. The main critics were Aleksander Brückner and Stanisław Urbańczyk. After rejecting the hypercritical approach to &quot;pantheon of Długosz&quot; many researchers, such as Aleksander Gieysztor, Andrzej Szyjewski, Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov, have been inclined to acknowledge the authenticity of at least some &quot;Polish gods&quot;, including Devana.

In Greek mythology, Artemis&#x27; helpers are nymphs, whose closest Slavic equivalents are boginki, which are found in Western Slavs, mainly in Poland. Boginki are young girls dressed in white or naked, who inhabited the shores of reservoirs, forests and caves from which they come out at night, especially on summer moon nights. They took care of wild animals and were often hostile to people, especially men. The moon was their &quot;god&quot; – it ruled their activity. Boginki were also supposed to shoot from a bow. In the Ruthenian legends, the number of vilas (similar to boginki) which are sisters, is 27 (&quot;three times nine&quot;) or, in another version, 30, and this may be related to the ecliptic division into 27 zodiacs (eg Nakshatra in Hinduism) and lunation. These features of boginki-nymphs may tie them to Devana-Artemis – goddess of forests and the moon.

=== Double goddess ===

Due to the multiple appearances of the pair Devana and Morana in the spring ceremonies, some researchers have suggested that both of these goddesses could be the two faces of one goddess of life and death. A similar motif occurs in Indo-European religions, e.g. the Scandinavian Hel (&quot;one half of her face had a handsome and pleasant expression, the other half dead and hideous&quot;) or the Greek couple Persephone-Kora, who spent half a year underground and half a year on earth. According to Kolankiewicz, double goddess may be indicated by alleged connection of Devana with Proto-Slavic &quot;*diva&quot; (&quot;female spirit, boginka&quot;) and Iranian deva (&quot;demon&quot;). The archaic nature of Devana and Morana may be indicated by a connection to vegetation, and that connects them to Mother Earth.

== In Christianity ==

During the Christianization, Devana could have been replaced by Our Lady of Thunder Candle (). Polish legend says that she walks on February nights and protects fields from freezing. The iconography depicts her with the wolf (or wolves) she protected from death from the peasants, and whom she made her servant, with a basket or a nest of larks at her feet, whose squeal was to herald the imminent coming of spring. In her hands, she always holds a &quot;thunder candle&quot; (, from &quot;grom&quot; &quot;thunder&quot;), which was used for fortune-telling, protect the house from wolves, lightning or evil, and used to burn the hair of children to protect them from ear disease. Thunder candle often occurs in sayings about the coming of spring. In the past, thunder candle wicks were made of &quot;verbascum&quot; and sometimes was named &quot;knotnica&quot; (from &quot;knot&quot; &quot;wick&quot;), &quot;royal candle&quot; or &quot;braid of the Virgin Mary&quot;. Connecting the feast of Our Lady of Thunder Candle (Candlemas) with wild animals appears in other Slavic countries.

<text>Punycode is a representation of Unicode with the limited ASCII character subset used for Internet hostnames. Using Punycode, host names containing Unicode characters are transcoded to a subset of ASCII consisting of letters, digits, and hyphens, which is called the letter–digit–hyphen (LDH) subset. For example, the German &quot;München&quot; (English: Munich) is encoded as &quot;Mnchen-3ya&quot;.

While the Domain Name System (DNS) technically supports arbitrary sequences of octets in domain name labels, the DNS standards recommend the use of the LDH subset of ASCII conventionally used for host names, and require that string comparisons between DNS domain names should be case-insensitive. The Punycode syntax is a method of encoding strings containing Unicode characters, such as internationalized domain names (IDNA), into the LDH subset of ASCII favored by DNS. It is specified in IETF Request for Comments 3492.

==Origin of the name==
The RFC author, Adam Costello, is reported to have written:

Why “Punycode”? It rhymes with Unicode and is intended to encode Unicode strings. It is “puny” in three senses: The repertoire of characters used in the encoded strings is small, the encoded strings are short, and the implementation is small.
==Description==
As stated in RFC 3492, &quot;Punycode is an instance of a more general algorithm called &quot;Bootstring&quot;, which allows strings composed from a small set of &#x27;basic&#x27; code points to uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger set.&quot; Punycode defines parameters for the general Bootstring algorithm to match the characteristics of Unicode text. This section demonstrates the procedure for Punycode encoding, using as an example the German string &quot;bücher&quot; (English: &quot;books&quot;), which is translated into the label &quot;bcher-kva&quot;.

To make the encoding and decoding algorithms simple, no attempt has been made to prevent some encoded values from encoding inadmissible Unicode values: however, these should be checked for and detected during decoding.

Punycode is designed to work across all scripts, and to be self-optimizing by attempting to adapt to the character set ranges within the string as it operates. It is optimized for the case where the string is composed of zero or more ASCII characters and in addition characters from only one other script system, but will cope with any arbitrary Unicode string. Note that for DNS use, the domain name string is assumed to have been normalized using nameprep and (for top-level domains) filtered against an officially registered language table before being punycoded, and that the DNS protocol sets limits on the acceptable lengths of the output Punycode string.

===Separation of ASCII characters===
First, all ASCII characters in the string are copied from input to output, skipping over any other characters. For example, &quot;bücher&quot; is copied to &quot;bcher&quot;. If any characters were copied, i.e. if there was at least one ASCII character in the input, an ASCII hyphen is appended to the output (e.g., &quot;bücher&quot; → &quot;bcher-&quot;, but &quot;ü&quot; → &quot;&quot;).

Note that hyphens are themselves ASCII characters. Thus, they can be present in the input and, if so, they will be copied to the output. This causes no ambiguity: if the output contains hyphens, the one that got added is always the last one. It marks the end of the ASCII characters.

===Encoding the non-ASCII characters===

The non-ASCII characters are sorted by Unicode value, lowest first. (If a character occurs more than once they are sorted by position.) Each is then encoded as a single number. This single number defines both the location to insert the character at and which character to insert.

* is an index into the result to insert the code at, starting at 0 (for insertion at the start).
* is the number of possible insertion points (current length of the result plus one).
* is the Unicode code point to insert minus 127.

The encoded number is . By dividing by and also getting the remainder, a decoder can determine and .

There are 6 possible places to insert a character in the string &quot;bcher&quot; (including before the first character and after the last one). is Unicode code point or 252 (see Latin-1 Supplement), and is 124. The is inserted at position 1, after the . Thus the encoder will add the number , and the decoder can retrieve these by and .

These numbers are strictly increasing. For the second and subsequent inserted characters, the difference between the number and the previous one is written.

The number is encoded using the letters through and the digits through . It is not base-36 but a more complex scheme described below, which allows the numbers to be concatenated, with nothing separating them.

===Variable-length number encoding===
Punycode uses generalized variable-length integers to represent these values. For example, this is how &quot;kva&quot; is used to represent the code number 745:
A number system with little-endian ordering is used which allows variable-length codes without separate delimiters: a digit lower than a threshold value marks that it is the most-significant digit, hence the end of the number. The threshold value depends on the position in the number and also on previous insertions, to increase efficiency. Correspondingly the weights of the digits vary.

In this case a number system with 36 symbols is used, with the case-insensitive &#x27;a&#x27; through &#x27;z&#x27; equal to the decimal numbers 0 through 25, and &#x27;0&#x27; through &#x27;9&#x27; equal to the decimal numbers 26 through 35. Thus &quot;kva&quot;, corresponds to the decimal number string &quot;10 21 0&quot;.
To decode this string of symbols, a sequence of thresholds will be needed, in this case it&#x27;s (1, 1, 26, 26, ...). The weight (or place value) of the least-significant digit is always 1: &#x27;k&#x27; (=10) with a weight of 1 equals 10. After this, the weight of the next digit depends on the first threshold: generally, for any &quot;n&quot;, the weight of the (&quot;n&quot;+1)-th digit is &quot;w&quot; × (36 − &quot;t&quot;), where &quot;w&quot; is the previous weight and &quot;t&quot; is the threshold of the &quot;n&quot;-th digit. So in this case, the second symbol has a place value of 36 minus the previous threshold value of 1, which equals 35. Therefore, the sum of the first two symbols &#x27;k&#x27; (=10) and &#x27;v&#x27; (=21) is 10 × 1 + 21 × 35. Since the second symbol is not less than its threshold value of 1, there is more to come. However, since the third symbol in this example is &#x27;a&#x27; (=0), we may ignore calculating its weight. Therefore, &quot;kva&quot; represents the decimal number (10 × 1) + (21 × 35) = 745.

Number 745 will be encoded as 10 + 21 × 35 + 0 (base 35 used for second digit, the most significant digit 0 needed as terminator), 10 → &#x27;k&#x27;, 21 → &#x27;v&#x27;, 0 → &#x27;a&#x27;, so &quot;bücher&quot; → &quot;bcher-kva&quot;.

The thresholds themselves are determined for each successive encoded character by an algorithm keeping them between 1 and 26 inclusive. The case can then be used to provide information about the original case of the string.

Because special characters are sorted by their code points by encoding algorithm, for the insertion of a second special character in &quot;bücher&quot;, the first possibility is &quot;büücher&quot; with code &quot;bcher-kvaa&quot;, the second &quot;bücüher&quot; with code &quot;bcher-kvab&quot;, etc. After &quot;bücherü&quot; with code &quot;bcher-kvae&quot; comes codes representing insertion of ý, the Unicode character following ü, starting with &quot;ýbücher&quot; with code &quot;bcher-kvaf&quot; (different from &quot;übücher&quot; coded &quot;bcher-jvab&quot;), etc.

===ACE prefix for internationalized domain names===
To prevent hyphens in non-international domain names from triggering a Punycode decoding, the string codice_1 is prepended to Punycode sequences in internationalized domain names. This is called ACE (ASCII Compatible Encoding).

Thus the domain name &quot;bücher.tld&quot; would be represented in a URL as &quot;xn--bcher-kva.tld&quot;.

<text>Jarylo (; ; ), alternatively Yaryla, Yarilo, Iarilo, Juraj, Jurij, or Gerovit, is an alleged East and South Slavic god of vegetation, fertility and springtime.

==Etymology==
The Proto-Slavic root &quot;*jarъ&quot; (&quot;jar&quot;, &quot;yar&quot;), from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*yōr-&quot;, &quot;*yeh₁ro-&quot;, from &quot;*yeh₁r-&quot;, means &quot;spring&quot; or &quot;summer&quot;, &quot;strong&quot;, &quot;furious&quot;, &quot;imbued with youthful life-force&quot;. This youthful life-force was considered sacred in the Slavic pre-Christian religion and the god personifying this sacred force was thus called Jarovit, or hypocoristically Jarilo.

==Sources==

The only historic source that mentions this deity is a 12th-century biography of the proselytizing German bishop Otto of Bamberg, who, during his expeditions to convert the pagan tribes of Wendish and Polabian Slavs, encountered festivals in honor of the war-god Gerovit in the cities of Wolgast and Havelberg. Gerovit is most likely a German derivation of the Slavic name &quot;Jarovit&quot;.

Up until the 19th century in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Serbia, folk festivals called &quot;Jarilo&quot; were celebrated in late spring or early summer. Early researchers of Slavic mythology recognised in them relics of pagan ceremonies in honor of an eponymous spring deity. 
In northern Croatia and southern Slovenia, especially White Carniola, similar spring festivals were called &quot;Jurjevo&quot; or &quot;Zeleni Juraj&quot; or &quot;Zeleni Jurij&quot; (Green George), nominally dedicated to St. George, and fairly similar to the Jarilo festivals of other Slavic nations.

<doc id="380595" wikidata="Q1298222" url="?curid=380595" title="Lada (mythology)">
<text>Lada and Lado are alleged Slavic deities. Lada was first mentioned around 1405–1412 in the sermons of Lucas of Wielki Koźmin, which warned against worshipping Lada and other gods during spring ceremonies and folk performances. 

The deities owe their popularity to Polish priest Jan Długosz, who described Lada as a goddess and a god of war in his works and compared her to the Roman Mars, to Aleksandr Faminstyn, who recognized the name &quot;Lada&quot; in Russian songs as attributed to the goddess of marriage, and to scholar Boris Rybakov, who insisted on recognizing her historicity. However, the vast majority of religious scholars and Slavists reject the historicity of these deities, believing that they owe their divine status to a misunderstanding of the song refrains by medieval scribes. 

According to some scholars of Baltic mythology, Lada was also worshipped by the Balts, but this view is also considered controversial. 

Planetoid (2832) Lada was named after her.

== Sources ==

=== Polish ===
The first source mentioning the theonym &quot;Lada&quot; is the &quot;Gniezno Sermons&quot;, which were written by Lucas of Wielki Koźmin around 1405-1412, without giving any description:
Similar cautions, also without any description, are also found in: &quot;Statua provincialia breviter&quot; (1420-1422), &quot;Sermones per circulum anni Cunradi&quot; (1423), &quot;Postilla Husitae anonymi&quot;, and in glosses of &quot;Life of Adalbert of Prague&quot;.

The theonyms contained in the &quot;Gniezno Sermons&quot; were also repeated by Jan Długosz, who made an &quot;interpretatio romana&quot; and compared Lada to the Roman war god Mars:
After Długosz the information about Lada was repeated by Maciej Miechowita, Marcin Kromer, Alexander Guagnini, Maciej Stryjkowski, Marcin and Joachim Bielski, and the priest Jakub Wujek. Maciej Miechowita, who copied information from Długosz, did not agree with him, however, on the function of Lada and &quot;corrected&quot; Długosz&#x27; information, comparing her to the Greek Leda and recognising her as the mother of Lel and Polel:
Outside the &quot;Annals&quot;, in &quot;Insignia seu clenodia Regis et Regni Poloniae&quot;, Długosz also mentions the female deity Lada, worshipped in the village of Łada near the river Łada, from which the Łada family took its name: &quot;Łada took its name from the name of a Polish goddess who was worshipped in Mazovia in the town and village of Łada&quot;. She is also mentioned in the : &quot;there was a church of three idols, which were called Lada, Boda, Leli, to which the ordinary people went on the first of May to make prayers to them and to offer them.&quot;.

=== East Slavic ===
God Lado appears twice in Eastern sources. The first is the &quot;Hustyn Chronicle&quot;, written in Church Slavonic from the 17th century, with an uncertain exact date of composition and an uncertain author. This source recognizes Lado as the god of marriage and joy, and compares him to the Greek god Bacchus-Dionysus:
Similar informations are found in the &quot;Kievan Synopsis&quot; of 1674 by Innocent Gizel, which mentions Lado as a deity of happynest, to whom offerings were made during wedding preparations. Leli and Poleli, and their mother, were also supposed to be worshipped by singing &quot;lado, lado, lado&quot;.

== Historicity ==

=== Sources ===
The only &quot;independent&quot; source mentioning the deity of Lada/Lado are the &quot;Gniezno Sermons&quot;, and other sources are dependent on them. The theonyms contained therein were then used and popularized by Jan Długosz in his &quot;Annals&quot;, where he did &quot;interpretatio romana&quot; and compared Lada to the Roman god of war Mars. Długosz&#x27;s description was then copied by subsequent Polish authors, such as Maciej Miechowita. Długosz and Miechowita together became sources for Marcin Kromer. Długosz, Miechowita and Kromer together became sources for Maciej Stryjkowski, Marcin and Joachim Bielski. Alexander Guagnini took his information from Stryjkowski and was even accused of plagiarism by him. He differs, however, as to the function of the gods. The information contained in was copied from Maciej Miechowita. Additionally, there is no information about such a cult on Łysa Góra in other sources and it is contradicted by archaeology.

East Slavic sources cannot be considered independent sources either. Although the &quot;Hustyn Chronicle&quot; contains original content, it is also a compilation of various earlier East Slavic as well as Polish sources. The fragment of &quot;Chronicle&quot; mentioning the god Lado copies information from Kromer, Marcin Bielski, and Guagnini. The same problem applies to the &quot;Synopsis&quot;, which copied information from Kromer and Stryjkowski, as well as from the &quot;Chronicle&quot;.

=== Genesis ===

Originally, the authenticity of the deity/deities was not denied and they appeared in the Slavic Romantics. Their authenticity was also assumed by early 18th and 19th century authors, such as Mikhail Popov, Mikhail Chulkov and Andrey Kaisarov, who assumed the authenticity of the &quot;Synopsis&quot;. The value of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; was also recognized by the Russian musicologist and composer Aleksandr Faminstyn in his 1884 work &quot;Bozhestva drevnikh slavyan&quot;. There he writes of a 17th century song from Croatia which notes &quot;the holy god Lado&quot; sung by girls dancing around a bonfire:


Additionally, he analyzed songs from all over the Slavdom, the existence of which was to prove the existence of the goddess Lada, wife of Lado.
Faminstyn believed that the theonyms should be translated as &quot;consent&quot;, and connected them with the Roman goddess of concord and harmony Concordia, whose name also translates as &quot;consent&quot;, and further with the goddess Bona Dea.

Starting in the 19th century, critical voices began to appear in the scientific community about the authenticity of the deities. One of the first and most influential was ethnographer and linguist Alexander Potebnja. After analyzing the source material, mainly song fragments, he came to the conclusion that &quot;lada&quot; appears in spring, summer and wedding songs, and that there are no grounds to consider this word as a remnant of the old goddess. This position was later upheld by linguists Gregor Kreka and Aleksander Brückner, as well as Max Vasmer and Oleg Trubachyov. Contemporary scholars overwhelmingly reject the authenticity of the deities Lada and Lado, believing, as in the case of Jesza, that the word &quot;lada&quot;, incomprehensible to the scribe, found in folk songs, was mistakenly considered a theonym, and then its attributes were added. This view is shared by scholars who consider at least part of Długosz&#x27;s mythological account to be valuable, such as Aleksander Gieysztor, Andrzej Szyjewski, or Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov.

The last influential scholar to insist on recognizing the historicity of Lada was Boris Rybakov. In his work, &quot;Yazychestvo drevnikh slavyan&quot; (1981), he hypothesized an Indo-European origin for the goddess Lada and compared her to the Greek Leda and Demeter. In addition, he considered another alleged goddess, &#x27;, to be her daughter, and considered them both to be identical with the Rozhanitse, and to be important deities in the Slavic pantheon before the rise of the &quot;Vladimir&#x27;s pantheon&quot;. According to him, Lada and &#x27; ruled over spring nature and agricultural work, fertility, love and marriage. However, he negatively referred to the male god Lado claiming that &quot;lado&quot; is a vocative case from &quot;lada&quot;.

The word &quot;lada&quot; means &quot;wife, female lover, consort&quot;, and &quot;husband, male lover, consort&quot; – it is a two-gender noun and was used for women as well as men; in this respect Brückner compares it to the Polish word . The word occurs, for example, in Old East Slavic as лада, &quot;lada&quot; &quot;husband&quot; (e.g. in &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, the longing wife calls out: &quot;bring my &quot;husband&quot; (&quot;lada&quot;) to me&quot;), Czech &quot;lada&quot; &quot;beloved&quot; or &quot;maiden, girl&quot; (e.g. in : &quot;Oh, what a wonder has happened, Jesus Christ, over your &quot;beloved&quot; (&quot;lada&quot;)&quot;), Ukrainian ла́до, &quot;lado&quot; &quot;husband&quot;, ла́да, &quot;lada&quot; &quot;wife&quot;, Serbo-Croatian ла̏да &quot;lada&quot; &quot;wife&quot;, or Bulgarian ла́да, &quot;lada&quot; &quot;the second daughter in the family who goes for water during the &quot;laduvane&quot; (ладу́ване – wedding tradition)&quot;. knows the Polish word &quot;łada&quot; only from sermons speaking about deity, so probably the word was no longer functioning in living language in the 15th century. The form &quot;Alado&quot; appearing in &quot;Postilla Husitae anonymi&quot; is probably the result of an attempt to adapt the word to Italian phonology. The form &quot;lado&quot; is not a separate word, but a vocative case from the word &quot;lada&quot;. From Slavic languages the word was borrowed into Baltic languages e.g. as &quot;lado&quot;, &quot;laduto&quot; etc.

Krzysztof Tomasz Witczak tried to read the Długosz&#x27;s theonym &quot;Lyada&quot; differently from other researchers. According to him, the Latin &quot;Lyada&quot; corresponds to the Old Polish form &quot;*Lęda&quot; because the consonant ⟨l⟩ in medieval Latin in Poland was written as &quot;ly&quot; or &quot;li&quot;, and he considers that the reading &quot;*Łada&quot; is unjustified and represents a folk etymology. He believed that &quot;*Lęda&quot; was supposed to be a pagan theonym that had been demonized, and he refers here to the Russian dialectical words ляд, &quot;lyad&quot;, and ляда, &quot;lyada&quot; meaning &quot;unclean spirit, devil&quot;. However, as Michał Łuczyński notes, the assumption that the &quot;ly&quot; notation corresponds to the vowel ⟨l⟩ justifies the reading of the Latin name as &quot;*Lada&quot; rather than &quot;*Lęda&quot;. In addition, an analysis of Długosz&#x27;s personal spelling features shows that the &quot;ly&quot; notation also served him for the consonant ⟨ł⟩, e.g: &quot;Lyassza Gora&quot; &quot;Łysa Góra&quot;, or &quot;Lyeba&quot; &quot;Łeba&quot;. Therefore, it should be assumed that Długosz&#x27;s &quot;Lyada&quot; corresponds to the old Polish form &quot;*Łada&quot;, as it is interpreted traditionally.

==== Further etymology ====
The Proto-Slavic form of &quot;lada&quot; is reconstructed as . Further etymology is unclear; it is generally believed that &quot;*lada&quot; is etymologically related to the Proto-Slavic noun and root (, ) meaning &quot;harmony, order&quot;. According to Brückner, the word derives from the verb &quot;ładzić&quot; &quot;to concur, agree&quot; (Proto-Slavic &quot;*laditi&quot;) → &quot;concurring, agreeing couple&quot; → &quot;husband, wife&quot; or &quot;lovers&quot;. The etymology of the word &quot;*ladъ&quot; is also unclear, and an kinship with Gothic 𐌻𐌴𐍄𐌰𐌽 (&quot;letan&quot; &quot;to let&quot;) has been suggested, or some relation to the word &quot;*lagoda&quot; &quot;gentleness&quot; – according to Brückner and Nikolay Shanskiy &quot;lad&quot; contains the decayed root &quot;la-&quot; &quot;over&quot; found in &quot;lagoda&quot; expanded with the suffix &quot;-d&quot; (cf. зад &quot;zad&quot;, под &quot;pod&quot;). According to Shanskiy &quot;lad&quot; originally meant &quot;top, peak&quot;, as opposed to &quot;pod&quot; &quot;bottom, pit&quot;. He also points to the word сладить, &quot;sladit&quot;&#x27; &quot;to win (over) someone&quot; and suggests the following shift in meaning: &quot;to win&quot; → &quot;to bring order&quot; → &quot;*laditi&quot; &quot;to live in harmony&quot; → &quot;*ladъ&quot; &quot;harmony, order&quot;.

=== Dida and Dido ===

Based on the Did-Lada refrain, uncritical and romantic old researchers, in addition to inventing Lada, also invented the god Dido and the goddess Dida.

Faminstyn considered these words as borrowed from the Baltic languages and pointed to the Lithuanian &quot;didis&quot; &quot;big, great&quot;. However, the attested fragment from the Slovak songs &quot;Didi-Jane, Didi-Jene&quot; &quot;o St. John&quot; sung on Saint John day may indicate to the native origins of these words (Proto-Slavic &quot;*did-&quot; &quot;big, great&quot;). The Proto-Slavic form may be continued by the Polish &quot;*dzidzi&quot;, which is most likely found in another theonym mentioned by Długosz: Dzidzilela.

== Lada as Baltic goddess ==
There is also a view among Baltic Romantics and some scholars that Lada was also worshipped by the Balts.

The word &quot;lada&quot;, and its various derivatives, appear in the refrains of sutartinės, Lithuanian polyphony songs, in various combinations, such as &quot;Lado tatato&quot; / &quot;Laduto, laduto&quot; / &quot;Loduta, loduta&quot; / &quot;Liadeli, liadeli&quot; / &quot;Ladutela, laduta&quot;, and others. Zenonas Slaviūnas grouped these songs as follows: workers&#x27; songs, wedding songs, military songs, family songs, dance songs, and songs about nature. Similarly, but more precisely, Vanda Misevičienė classified them, moving the songs about crane to the groups of rye-gathering songs and the songs about fir tree to the groups of family songs.

According to Norbertas Vėlius, although the songs belong to different groups, they all have much in common. For example, in the sutartinės about the conifer, the image about the maturation of young people is poetically represented by a conifer tree that outgrows all the trees in the forest. In another song, a crane is called upon to fly into the garden, pick flowers and make a wreath – this motif evokes the idea that a bride-to-be should start making a wreath to join the ranks of adults. In another sutartinės the shooter kills a crane, which is supposed to mean a girl taken by a boy, and in yet another song the crane is asked to feed &quot;his children&quot;. The songs &quot;Kad mes buvom&quot; and &quot;Selagij viteli rikavo&quot; are openly wedding songs and tell of courtship. Also, the song &quot;Išjos brolis&quot;, which has a military character, is sung on behalf of a sister who talks about her feelings. Finally, the song &quot;Laduto, laduto&quot; tells about the bad relationship between daughter-in-law and father-in-law. According to Vėlius, all songs with these refrains refer to young people, especially girls who have reached adulthood. Thus, it should be considered that if the word &quot;Lado&quot; occurring in these refrains had any meaning, it should be associated primarily with young people.

In his search for the origin of these words, Vėlius points to Stryjowski&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot;, where he describes the custom of dancing and singing &quot;Lado, lado ir mano lado&quot; in honor of &quot;Liada or Ladona – the mother of Castor and Pollux&quot;. In another place of his &quot;Chronicle&quot; dedicated to Lithuania and Samogitia, he writes that Lithuanians worshipped the god &quot;Dzidzis Lado&quot;, in whose honor they sang &quot;Lado, lado, lado didis mūsų dieve&quot;. He also mentions Kromer&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Kievan Synopsis&quot;. He notes, however, that the reliability of these sources is low and cites the opinions of Lithuanian researchers, such as Simonas Stanevičius, who believed that the god Lado was invented by Stryjkowski on the basis of a folk songs, Simonas Daukantas, who regarded the god &quot;Dzidzis Lado&quot; as a distorted form of &quot;Titis leido&quot; referring to Perkūnas, Mikalojus Akelaitis, according to whom Lado is a distorted form from &quot;laide&quot; or &quot;leide&quot;, and Brückner, according to whom Lado was borrowed into Lithuanian songs along with the Kupala night, and several other Lithuanian scholars who rejected the deity&#x27;s authenticity. He also recalls that the Slavic deity Lada/Lado is regarded with distrust by Slavic scholars. He also mentions several Lithuanian and Slavic researchers who accepted the deity&#x27;s authenticity, but notes that many of them were not mythologists but ethnographers who did not study the deity&#x27;s authenticity.

However, according to him, an argument for the existence of the goddess could be the Bulgarian custom of &quot;laduvane&quot;, during which the second girl in the family who goes to fetch water is called &quot;lada&quot;. The Greek dragon Ladon may also be an argument, assuming that the coincidence of the similarity of words is not accidental, and the Lithuanian words &quot;ladėti&quot;, &quot;laduti&quot; meaning &quot;to reprimand, abuse&quot;, &quot;to curse, damn&quot;, as well as the Latvian &quot;lādēt&quot;, and words from the semantic field &quot;to curse&quot;, also often have a mythological meaning.

Bronislava Kerbelytė argues against the existence of the goddess Lada among the Balts. She states that the Slavic chant &quot;lada&quot; generally appears in wedding songs, and she reads the word &quot;did&quot; as &quot;&quot;dziad&quot;, grandfather&quot;, which sometimes appears in the names of Slavic ritual objects around the winter solstice, such as &quot;dednik&quot; (or &quot;badnjak&quot;) or &quot;didukh&quot;, which are associated with the cult of fertility. In Russian, the wedding is sometimes called &quot;rukobitije&quot; (&quot;crossing of arms&quot;), from which the clapping while singing the refrains of the &quot;lada&quot; during children&#x27;s songs may derive. She further points out the analogy between East Slavic songs with the refrain &quot;lada&quot; and songs during Līgo noted by Eduards Volters. Latvian &quot;līgt&quot; meaning &quot;to employ,&quot; &quot;to make peace,&quot; and &quot;līgums&quot; &quot;to agree,&quot; along with Lithuanian &quot;lygti&quot;, &quot;sulygti&quot; &quot;to consult, negotiate, agree,&quot; correspond to the Slavic word &quot;lad&quot;. She gives the example of a story about a Gypsy who forced a peasant to exchange horses by jokingly suggesting to the villager that they should go to an inn, shake hands, and shout &quot;liko&quot;. When they did so, the gypsy took the peasant&#x27;s horse, taking advantage of the fact that the peasant had forgotten the meaning of shaking hands and the shouting. The symbol of crossed hands was also used during Lithuanian summer solstice celebrations, e.g. a couple would jump over the fire holding hands: if they let go while jumping, they would not get married.

Jan Łasicki (16-17th century) mentions god Tavalas in one of his works. Scholars have compared this name to a song written by Simonas Daukantas sung by boys dragging a log on Christmas Eve, which was supposed to prove the existence of the god Tabalas: 

However, an analysis of the song and language shows that &quot;tabalai&quot; is derived from the verb &quot;tabaluoti&quot; &quot;to dangle&quot;. The authenticity of other deities mentioned by Łasicki is also rejected, e.g.: alleged theonym Šluotražis is derived from the word &quot;šluotražis&quot; &quot;broom&quot; and was a magical and symbolic (related to healing) ritual object, to which it has already been explained by many scholars. Thus, according to Kerbelytė, there are no grounds to consider Tabalas or Lada as Lithuanian deities – these words were only magic words or objects used in rituals and ceremonies. The &quot;lado&quot; refrain is also considered a ritual vocabulary by Lithuanian ethnologist Rimantas Balsys, who blames the misunderstanding in the Baltic context on the uncritical use of 16th century sources and the activity of the Romantics, who considered the ritual &quot;ledų dienos&quot; (&quot;day of ice&quot;) as proof of the existence of the winter goddess Lada. In the case of the historicity of the Slavic deity, he takes a neutral position.

<text>Morana (in Czech, Slovene, Bosnian, Croatian and Montenegrin), Morena (in Slovak and Macedonian), Mora (in Bulgarian), Mara (in Ukrainian), Morė (in Lithuanian), Marena (in Russian), or Marzanna (in Polish) is a pagan Slavic goddess associated with seasonal rites based on the idea of death and rebirth of nature. She is an ancient goddess associated with winter&#x27;s death, rebirth and dreams. In ancient Slavic rites, the death of the Goddess Morana at the end of winter becomes the of Spring of the Goddess Kostroma (Russian), Lada or Vesna representing the coming of Spring.

Some medieval Christian sources such as the Czech 13th century Mater Verborum compare her to the Greek goddess Hecate, associating her with sorcery. 15th century Polish chronicler Jan Długosz likened her in his &quot;Annales&quot; to Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture (together with another Slavic goddess Dziewanna).

In modern times, the rituals associated with Marzanna have lost their sacred character and are a pastime – an occasion to have fun and celebrate the beginning of spring. The tradition is usually celebrated around the spring equinox (March 21). Usually schoolchildren and young people participate in the celebrations alongside local folklore groups and other residents. A procession consisting of men, women and children carries handmade Morana (and often also &quot;Marzaniok&quot; dolls, the male counterpart to Morana) to the nearest river, lake or pond. The participants sing traditional songs and throw effigies of Morana into the water. Sometimes the effigies are first set on fire, or their clothes are torn. On the journey back to the village the focus falls on the copses, adorned with ribbons and blown egg shells. The procession, still singing, returns to the village. In some locations (e.g. in Brynica – a district of Miasteczko Śląskie), the beginning of spring is then celebrated with a feast.

== Names and etymology ==
Morana&#x27;s name most likely comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *mar-, , signifying death. The Slovak form of the theonym – &quot;Ma(r)muriena&quot; – suggests that the goddess may have originally been connected to the Roman god of war Mars (known under a variety of names, including &quot;Marmor&quot;, &quot;Mamers&quot; and &quot;Mamurius Veturius&quot;). The connection to Mars is supported by, among others, Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov, who underline that he was originally an agricultural deity.

Other theories claim her name is derived from the same Indo-European root as Latin &quot;mors&quot; &#x27;death&#x27; and Russian &quot;mor&quot; &#x27;pestilence&#x27;. Some authors also likened her to mare, an evil spirit in Germanic and Slavic folklore, associated with nightmares and sleep paralysis. In Belarusian, Polish, Ukrainian and in some Russian dialects the word &#x27;&#x27; means dream. But Vladimir Dahl says it means &#x27;phantom&#x27;, &#x27;vision&#x27;, &#x27;hallucination&#x27;.

== Traditions ==
The tradition of burning or drowning an effigy of Morana to celebrate the end of winter is a folk custom that survives in the Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania, and Slovakia. In the past, the festival was held on the fourth Sunday of Lent. In the 20th century the date March 21 was fixed (March 20–21). The rite involves preparing an effigy in female clothing, and either setting it on fire or drowning in a river (or both). This is often performed during a field trip by children in kindergarten and primary schools. The effigy, often made by the children themselves, can range in size from a puppet to a life-size dummy. This ritual represents the end of the dark days of winter, the victory over death, and the welcoming of the spring rebirth.

=== Drowning of Morana ===
Morana is also the name used to describe the effigy of the goddess, which was ritually burned and/or drowned during an early spring rite called Jare Święto to hasten the approach of spring. The custom of drowning the effigy of Morana derives from sacrificial rites; its function was to ensure a good harvest in the upcoming year. Following the principles of sympathetic magic – as described by James Frazer – it was believed that burning an effigy representing the goddess of death would remove any results of her presence (i.e., the winter) and thus bring about the coming of spring.

The effigy has usually been made of straw, wrapped in white cloth and adorned with ribbons and necklaces. Traditionally the effigy has initially been carried past every house in the village by a group of children holding green juniper twigs. During this procession Morana was repeatedly dipped in every encountered puddle or stream. In the evening the effigy passed to the young adults; the juniper twigs were lit, and thus illuminated Morana was carried out of the village, burned, and thrown into water. There is a number of superstitions related to the custom of drowning Morana: one cannot touch the effigy once it&#x27;s in the water or one&#x27;s hand will wither; looking back while returning home may cause an illness, while stumbling and falling may lead to a relative&#x27;s death within the coming year.

The Catholic Church attempted to forbid this old pagan custom. In 1420, the Synod of Poznań instructed the Polish clergy: &quot;Do not allow the superstitious Sunday custom, do not permit them to carry around the effigy they call Death and drown in puddles&quot;. However, both the custom and tradition prevailed. At the turn of the 18th century there has been an attempt to replace it (on the Wednesday preceding Easter) with a newly introduced custom of throwing an effigy symbolizing Judas down from a church tower. This attempt also failed. Today, the custom is celebrated at spring equinox on March 21, which coincides with the traditional date of Jare Święto.

=== Morana and the copse ===

The rite of drowning Morana, often conducted together with carrying bouquets of green twigs and branches (dubbed &quot;gaik&quot; in Polish, literally &quot;copse&quot;) was originally performed on the fourth Sunday of Lent, called the White Sunday. The tradition of celebrating it on March 21 only began in the 20th century. Most researchers agree that the custom of carrying the copse (also known as &quot;grove, new summer&quot;, or &quot;walking with the Queen&quot;) from house to house was earlier performed much later in the year, probably shortly after Easter.

==== The effigy of Morana ====
Details of the ritual vary from region to region. Typically the effigy or doll representing Morana is made of straw and dressed in traditional local costume, rags, or even bridesmaid&#x27;s clothes. Morana may resemble a young woman wearing a garland as well as an old crone. Village dwellers carry the effigy away from the village, often singing event-related songs. Jerzy Pośpiech points out that at first only adults participated in the ritual; only when the custom became a fun game did the young join in.

Depending on local tradition, the ritual that takes place after the procession reaches its chosen destination can be performed in various ways: sometimes the effigy is first torn into pieces, its clothes ripped off, and then drowned in a lake, river or even a puddle. In some variants of the ritual, the effigy is burned; in others, it is first set on fire and then thrown into water. A number of superstitions (also locally varied) are connected to the ritual, e.g.: the person who last returns to the village after the ritual is sure to die in the coming year. In some locations, a tradition functions in which Morana is given a male counterpart – Marzaniok.

==== Walking with the copse ====
Walking with the Copse is a ritual in which pine branches, twigs or even entire small trees (pine or spruce) – adorned with ribbons, handmade ornaments, egg shells or flowers – are carried from house to house. In some variations of the ritual, a doll is tied to the top branch; in others, a local girl accompanies the copse (hence &quot;walking with the Queen&quot;). The copse is usually carried by girls, who walk from house to house, dance, sing and extend best wishes to the hosts. Some sources relate that the group also collected donations. Today the ritual often takes the form of bringing a decorated copse to the village after the ritual of drowning Morana is completed. This type of a two-part ritual (destroying the effigy and then returning with the copse) had been observed in the Opole region, the western parts of Kraków Voivodeship, Podhale, Slovakia, Moravia, Bohemia, Lusatia and Southern Germany (Thuringia, Franconia). In the 19th century Oskar Kolberg noted that the copse had been carried around as a standalone custom (without the prior destruction of Morana) around Kraków and Sandomierz, as well as in the regions of Mazovia (on Easter Tuesday) and Lesser Poland (beginning of May or the Green week).

=== Traditions related to Morana and the copse in Silesia ===
The date when the customs of drowning Morana and carrying the copse originated in Silesia is unknown. Although the Catholic Church considered these to be pagan traditions, and persecuted them accordingly, the custom nevertheless survived in Silesia even at times when it had been almost extinct in other regions of Poland. Researchers point out that traditionally only women and girls would walk with a hand-made Morana; only later was the custom taken over by young adults and children. In some regions – such as around Gliwice and Racibórz – local girls were followed by boys carrying Marzanna&#x27;s male equivalent – Marzaniok. The effigies were carried around the village. Songs, often improvised, were sung in front of each house, especially if a girl lived in it. Hosts would reward the singers with money or eggs. Afterwards, the singing procession left the village and went to a nearby body of water – a stream, pond, lake or even a puddle. If there was no lake or pond nearby, the effigy was burned; its clothes had been ripped off or it had been pelted with snow or mud.

The procession would usually return carrying a copse – a small spruce or pine tree adorned with eggs and ribbons. Nicknamed &quot;latko&quot; (summer), the copse symbolised the spring and blooming nature. The procession carried it into the village, accompanied by songs and best wishes.

== Significance ==
Today, Morana is often perceived as a personification of winter and the symbolic drowning ends this season and returns life. In this interpretation, the corpse is used to welcome spring and to affirm the re-awakening of nature. However, modern interpretations simplify the ritual: one example is merging two originally separate rituals and changing the time of the year at which they were celebrated. Moreover, even medieval chroniclers suggested that the custom had already evolved into a light-hearted, fun event and its original meaning had been almost forgotten.

Researchers emphasise that Morana functioned not merely as a symbol of winter, but also as a Slavic goddess. Morana&#x27;s later association with death (in some regions Morana is called Death Crone) trivialized the importance of the goddess, who was the lady of not only death, but also life, and commanded the natural world.

Drowning Morana in water (an element of high importance in season-related folk celebrations) is understood as the goddess&#x27; symbolic descent into the underworld, to be reborn with next winter. Some researchers underline the sacrificial character of this ritual and suggest that Morana is sacrificed to appease Winter. The authors of &quot;Wyrzeczysko&quot; propose that Morana is sacrificed to the demons of water, whose favour was necessary to ensure a plentiful harvest in the coming year.

Celebrating the Copse after Easter – in full spring – performs an individual function in the cycle of rebirth: it announces the coming of spring, a time of joy and song, a time when the Earth bears new fruit.

<text>In Slavic mythology, Ognyena Maria (literally &quot;Fiery Mary&quot;) is a fire goddess who is the sister and assistant of the thunder god, Perun. Ognyena Maria originates as a conflation of the figures of Margaret the Virgin and the Virgin Mary, both regarded as sisters of Saint Elias.

This divinity also appears with southern Slavs, and is usually considered to be the sister of the thunder god/saint. She was also associated with rain or the sea, or with Lazarus (Марина Лазоревая) and azure flashes of lightning.

Ognyena Maria’s feast in the folk calendar of the Slavs is on July 17, on the Julian calendar (around 30 July).

==Belarus==

In Belarus, she is prayed towards for healing from ailments: &quot;Добры вечар, цёмна ноч! На табе, вада, маю бяду, а мне маё здароўе назад аддай&quot; (&quot;Good evening, dark night! I leave my troubles to you, water, and give me my health in return.&quot;)

==Bulgaria==

In Bulgaria, she is celebrated on July 22, as the day she prevents fires. A strict ban is observed on housework to prevent any disastrous fires on that day, as the summer at July was hot enough to start such outbreaks. They believe that anyone who breaks the ban will suffer destructive fires that will break out against them and their households. Her festival culminates a celebration on 15–22 July, related to the Goreshtnitsi Festival at the 28–30 July.

As the mistress of snakes, people were also forbidden from using ropes and threads on her feast days. During those days, snakes were said to hide in the underworld.

The first day of Goreshtnitsi was when all fires were extinguished, and no new fires will be lit until the third day, when the Bulgarians celebrate the fires of the Holy Spirit. Some do it to celebrate Ognyena Maria&#x27;s power over fire.

Some Bulgarians believe that as she is the sister of Saint Elijah, she hides from him on St. Elias&#x27; Day, to ensure that he would not be so delighted, that his lightning and thunder would destroy everything.

==Russia==

In Russia, she is considered as the daughter of a king from the sea. As she felt bored of life in his palace, she fled to land. Her father got angry from this, and so he rained down darts of lightning on her birthday, that anyone who saw the lightning will be blind. Her birthday falls around Trinity Week (also known as Русальная неделя, or Rusalka Week), or St. Elias&#x27; Day.

People were advised not to swim or bathe on the days leading to Trinity Week, as it is believed that mermaids would drown anyone who does so on any water. If anyone has to, crosses, garlic, magic charms, and wormwood were used to stave the mermaids off.

==Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina==

In Serbia and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina with Bosnian Serb population, including Republic of Srpska, Ognjena Marija is usually associated with Margaret the Virgin and along with Saint Elijah, is considered as one of the fiery saints (). 

According to the traditional views, the people are usually forbidden to do any kind of work on Ognjena Marija&#x27;s day, as it won&#x27;t bring them any good. This even includes simple tasks such as putting thread into needle or even washing ones clothes with washing machine. It is believed that the disobedient people will be punished with extensive fires, which will burn their crops, haystacks and homes. The similar beliefs exist for the Saint Elijahs day, where instead of fires, the disobedient people and their property will be stricken with thunder, ultimately resulting in either decimation of their food supplies and shelter or even in death. 

In contrast to that, the families that celebrate Ognjena Marija as their Slava, are allowed to do some work which is required to hold celebrations on that day. It is said that whichever family has Ognjena Marija as their Slava is always certain that they&#x27;ll always have the fullest crop yield.

==Ukraine==

In Ukraine, villagers would pay attention to the lightning in the sky, hoping that on Ognyena Maria&#x27;s day, this will indicate that God will send rain for their crops.

<text>Perkunatete, Perkunatele or Perkūnėlė is in Baltic mythology the thunder goddess mother of Perkūnas, in Slavic mythology referred to as Percunatele mother of Perun, which is probably derived from the Balts. Like many such goddesses absorbed into Christianity, she is, today, difficult to distinguish from the Christian madonna, Mary, one of whose epithets was Panna Maria Percunatele. Professor Patricia Monaghan of DePaul University also believes that she was originally derived from the Baltic thunder goddess.

The character of Perkunatete seems to be present in the myths of Baltic sun goddess Saulė. This solar goddess, after her daily ride, bathes in a sauna to rest and recover her strength for another daily travel, with Perkunatete waiting on her.
In the book of Georges Dumézil, it is described that Perkunatele was represented as an oak tree with a cleft, resembling the female genitals, where lightning hit. A fire could sometimes break out when the wood was not humid, bringing pain to her. This can be two things, passion that leads to the delivery of a child or a bad lover.
If it was the first, laughter will come out of her uterus. If the former, Perkunatele would scream in agony. Its the classic myth of fertility that is present on many cultures, you have to satisfy your lover to bring harmony to the act of coitus.
Unlike the Christian Madonna, Perkunatele was not immaculate. The name derivates from PIE *Perkwunos, cognate to *perkwus, a word for &quot;oak&quot;, &quot;fir&quot; or &quot;wooded mountain&quot;.

<text>Stribog is a god in Slavic mythology found in three East Slavic sources, whose cult may also have existed in Poland. The sources do not inform about the functions of the god, but nowadays he is most often interpreted as a wind deity who distributes wealth.&quot;&quot;

== History ==
Stribog appears for the first time in the 12th-century &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; together with other gods for whom Vladimir the Great erected statues:

In &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, the winds are called &quot;Stribog&#x27;s grandsons&quot;:

The &quot;word of John Chrysostom&quot; also mentions Stribog:

== Legacy ==

After Christianization, the name was preserved in toponymy: Стрибожь, &quot;Stribozh&quot;&#x27; in Novgorod Governorate, Стрибоже, &quot;Strybozhe&quot; leak, Стрибожская, &quot;Strybozhskaya&quot; river in Kiev Voivodeship, Стрибож, &quot;Strybozh&quot; village in Zhytomyr Oblast, in Poland &quot;Strzyboga&quot; village and the &quot;Striboc&quot; (= &quot;Stribog&quot;) stream near Tczew, attested in the 1282, and possibly Latin name for river from modern-day Germany &quot;Striboz&quot; (1122).

== Etymologies and interpretations ==

=== Modern etymologies ===

==== Wind interpretation ====
According to Roman Jakobson, &quot;Stribog&quot; contains the stem &quot;stri-&quot;, derived from the Proto-Slavic verb &quot;*sterti&quot; &quot;to extend, spread, widen, scatter&quot; attested only with suffixes, e.g. Polish &quot;rozpostrzeć&quot;, Russian простереть, &quot;prosteret&quot;&#x27;, or Old Czech &quot;(nepokoj) strieti&quot;. The verb comes from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*ster-&quot;, which in Latin occurs in the verb &quot;sterno&quot; and in the Greek verb στόρνυμι, &quot;stórnymi&quot; &quot;to spread&quot;. The theonym would thus consist of the stem &quot;stri-&quot; and the word &quot;bog&quot; &quot;god&quot;. On this basis, he considers Stribog to be &quot;disperser, apportioner of riches&quot;, a complementary god to Dazhbog, &quot;giver of riches&quot;. Proof of Stribog&#x27;s association with wind is to be found in his Hindu counterpart, the wind god Vayu, who says in the &quot;Avesta&quot; &quot;I am called he who spreads&quot;. He links the pair of Dazhbog and Stribog with the Vedic pair of Bhaga and Amsha, or the Greek pair of Aisa and Poros. This etymology is one of the most popular.

According to Michał Łuczyński, Jakobson&#x27;s etymology is linguistically correct, however, according to him, the division of the theonym into &quot;stri-&quot; and &quot;-bog&quot; is unlikely, since hydronyms and personal names indicate that the consonant ⟨b⟩ belonged to the root, not the suffix, e.g., the Ukrainian hydronym Стриб, &quot;Stryb&quot;, or Polish names beginning with &quot;Strzyb-&quot;: &quot;*Strzybala&quot;, &quot;Strzybalska&quot;, &quot;Strzybna&quot;, &quot;Strzybny&quot;.

Stanisław Urbańczyk, following Lubor Niederle and Alexander Afanasyev, linked the theonym with the Czech dialectal (Moravian) &quot;stři&quot; &quot;strong wind, air&quot;, and explained the theonym as &quot;god of creaking, swishing&quot;.

Jakobson&#x27;s etymology was supported by Aleksander Gieysztor. In his search for manifestations of the cult of wind in the Slavs, he pointed to the Bulgarian wind тъмичарин, &quot;tŭmicharin&quot;, which brings darkness and blinds, and in Serbia the southern wind is called &quot;one-eyed&quot; (чоравац, &quot;čoravac&quot;), which may be an echo of some ancient mythological motif, to which perhaps is related the one-eyed Odin, who, like Stribog, is placed in the first group of Dumézil&#x27;s tripartite, and who is sometimes interpreted as the god of wind, breath.

==== Water interpretation ====
Omelyan Ohonóvsʹkyy and Aleksander Brückner rejected the wind etymology as unwarranted. Instead, they related the theonym to the Ukrainian verb стриба́ти, &quot;strybaty&quot; &quot;to jump&quot; and explained it as &quot;god-jumper, god who jumps&quot;. Brückner divided the word in terms of its structure into the segment &quot;strib-&quot;, and the suffix &quot;-og&quot;, in the likeness of Svarog (&quot;svar-&quot; + &quot;-og&quot;). He pointed to a whole family of words with the &quot;strib-&quot; segment connected with jumping: стриб, &quot;stryb&quot; &quot;jump&quot;, стриба́ти, &quot;strybaty&quot; &quot;to jump&quot;, стрибо́к, &quot;strybok&quot; &quot;jump&quot;, стрибну́ти, &quot;strybnuty&quot; &quot;to jump&quot;, etc. He further indicated that he could not say anything more about the theonym.

Michał Łuczyński returns to such an etymology. He points out that the Ukrainian word about such a meaning is also found in some south-western dialects of Russian. In addition, he points out that while researching the etymology of this theonym, certain words were overlooked: Russian стрыбый, &quot;strybyy&quot; &quot;rapid, swift (&quot;fast-dripping&quot;)&quot;, Russian dial. стрива́ть, &quot;stribat&#x27;&quot; &quot;to flash (of lightning)&quot;, and Ukrainian стрибати, &quot;strybaty&quot; in the meaning &quot;to escape, fly&quot;, &quot;to jump high and far&quot;. He reconstructs the Proto-Slavic form of these words as &quot;*strybati&quot; from the Proto-Slavic stem &quot;*strū-&quot;. According to him, &quot;to jump&quot;, &quot;to leap&quot; as the meaning of this word family in Ukrainian and some Russian dialects developed late, and the original meaning of these words would be &quot;to move at high speed&quot;, and &quot;to flow&quot;. He points to the Baltic equivalent of the meaning of Russian &quot;strybyy&quot; &quot;rapid, swift&quot;, Lithuanian &quot;sraujùs&quot; &quot;rapid&quot;, Latvian &quot;stràujš&quot; &quot;fast, quick, rapid&quot;, which may indicate the probable existence of Russian &quot;stryb-&quot; &quot;current (water)&quot;, cf. Lithuanian &quot;sraujà&quot;, Latvian &quot;strauja&quot; &quot;current (water)&quot;. Additionally, Russian dial. &quot;stribat&quot;&#x27; &quot;to flash (of lightning)&quot; bears a close semantic resemblance to Serbo-Croatian &quot;strujiti&quot; &quot;to flow (of electricity)&quot;, and quotes other linguists, according to whom Serbo-Croatian &quot;strujiti&quot; can refer to water as well as air, and figuratively also to electricity.

He reconstructs the Proto-Slavic form of the theonym as &quot;*Strybogъ&quot;, which would consist of the segment &quot;*strybъ&quot; (a verb noun from &quot;*strybati&quot; &quot;to move quickly&quot; from &quot;to flow, run&quot;), and the suffix &quot;-ogъ&quot;, which had no function. The segment itself would continue the Proto-Slavic stem &quot;*stry-&quot; &quot;to flow, run&quot;, from the Proto-Balto-Slavic &quot;*srū-&quot;, from the Proto-Indo-European &quot;*srew-&quot; &quot;to flow&quot;. This etymology is supported by the fact that after Christianization this theonym was preserved mainly in hydronyms, which proves that the meaning of the theonym was known to the Slavs.

The Old East Slavic notation of the theonym (Стрибогъ, &quot;Stribogǔ&quot;) with the vowel ⟨i⟩ instead of the expected ⟨y⟩ is explained as a mixing of these vowels, which is attested in the texts of southern East Slavic since the end of the 11th century, which is connected with the influence of the grammar of the Old Church Slavonic/Bulgarian language on the Old East Slavic language. The mixing of these vowels also occurs in hydronyms (&quot;*Stir-&quot;/&quot;*Styr&quot;) and in Ukrainian, cf. Стрый/Стрий, &quot;Stryj&quot;/&quot;Strij&quot;, Стрына/Стрина, &quot;Stryna&quot;/&quot;Strina&quot;.

=== Dated and other etymologies ===
According to Mark Vey, Stribog could in fact be originally an epithet meaning literally &quot;father god&quot;, which was used in the religions of Indo-Europeans to describe the god of the bright sky. The reconstructed Proto-Indo-European term for &quot;god father&quot; is &quot;*Dyḗus ph₂tḗr&quot; (cp. Roman Jupiter (&quot;Iūpiter&quot;, &quot;Diespiter&quot;), Greek Zeus (&quot;Zeus Pater&quot;) and Vedic Dyaus (&quot;Dyáuṣ-pitṛ́&quot;); sometimes in reverse order) and its local variety &quot;*ph₂tḗr bhagos&quot;. After the so-called Iranian inversion, Slavic peoples abandoned the word &quot;*dyḗus&quot; and replaced it with the word &quot;bog&quot;, which is borrowed from Iranian languages (from the PIE. &quot;*bhagos&quot;) and which appears as a second part of the name. Proto-Indo-European &quot;*ph₂tḗr&quot; (&quot;father&quot;) is generally also considered to be absent in the Slavic languages (replaced by the synonym &quot;*átta&quot; → &quot;otec&quot;) or even in the Balto-Slavic languages, but according to Vey, &quot;*ph₂tḗr&quot; turned into the Slavic word &quot;*stryjь&quot;, which now means &quot;uncle, father&#x27;s brother&quot; as follows: &quot;*ph₂tḗr&quot; → &quot;*ptri-&quot; → &quot;stri-&quot; and is the first part of the name. Stribog could therefore be the Slavic god of sky. This etymology has been advocated by a number of scholars, including Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov who placed Stribog in the first group of the so-called the trifunctional hypothesis of Dumézil, which groups the main deities who look after the community and watch over the distribution of goods.

Such etymology is criticized by most linguists. The word &quot;*stryjь&quot; is derived from PIE &quot;*stru-io-&quot; and is cognate to Lithuanian &quot;strùjus&quot; &quot;uncle, old man&quot;, Old Irish &quot;sruith&quot; &quot;old, venerable&quot; and Old Welsh &quot;strutiu&quot; &quot;old man&quot;, and the process described by Vey did not occur in Slavic language. Brückner in his &quot;Dictionary&quot; noted that the word &quot;stryj&quot; was sometimes referred to as &quot;good wind&quot; and connected it to the core &quot;stru-&quot; &quot;to flow&quot; (cf. Stryj in Ukraine).

There are also other interpretations of the name: Zelenin connected the &quot;stri-&quot; root with the word стрити, &quot;stryty&quot; (Proto-Slavic &quot;*sъtьri&quot;) &quot;to annihilate, destroy,&quot; and considered Stribog to be &quot;annihilating, destroying god,&quot; the god of war. This view was supported by Orlov and Borovsky, this may also be indicated by the fact that Vayu is also worshipped as the god of war, of the dead, of the harvest, but also of the good and bad fate, as he connects sky and earth. The name was also associated with the nickname of Ahura Mazda &quot;Śribaya&quot;/&quot;Stribaya&quot; (&quot;god of beauty&quot;, &quot;god worthy of honor&quot;, cf. Sanskrit श्री, &quot;śri&quot; &quot;beauty&quot;), which is supposed to be an Iranian influence and ultimately come from &quot;*ph₂tḗr bhagos&quot;, but this etymology is problematic. Pisani reconstructed the name as &quot;*strigo-bogъ&quot;, in which &quot;*strigo-&quot; would correspond to the Latin &quot;frigus&quot; (&quot;frost, cold&quot;) and in that case Stribog would be the god of cold.

== Cultural depictions ==
In the 12th century poem &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; the winds are called &quot;Stribogs grandsons&quot;

Stribog is a mentioned in Mercedes Lackey World Divided Book 2 (2012) of the Secret World Chronicles where slavic folklore entities are reimagined as meta humans.

Strzybog ; depicted as a deity of wind appears as a supporting character in &quot;Devil&#x27;s Deal&quot; (2024) by Layla Fae.

&quot;The Wind Child (&quot;2002) by Gabriela Houston features as a protagonist a granddaughter of the deity Stribog.

<doc id="380625" wikidata="Q689826" url="?curid=380625" title="Svarog">
<text>Svarog is a Slavic god who may be associated with fire and blacksmithing and who was once interpreted as a sky god on the basis of an etymology rejected by modern scholarship. He is mentioned in only one source, the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, which is problematic in interpretation. He is presented there as the Slavic equivalent of the Greek god Hephaestus. The meaning of his name is associated with fire. He is the father of Dazhbog and Svarozhits.

== Etymology ==

The theonym &quot;Svarog&quot; presents in several forms. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; has &quot;Соварога&quot; (&quot;Sovaroga&quot;), &quot;Сварогъ&quot; (&quot;Svarogǔ&quot;), &quot;Сварогом&quot; (&quot;Svarogom&quot;), and &quot;Сварога&quot; (&quot;Svaroga&quot;). The &quot;Sofia Chronograph&quot; has &quot;Сварог&quot; (&quot;Svarog&quot;) and &quot;Сварож&quot; (&quot;Svarož&quot;).

The fire etymology was one of the first to be proposed by the Slovene linguist Franc Miklošič (1875), who explained the theonym &quot;Svarog&quot; as consisting of the stem &quot;svar&quot; (&#x27;heat&#x27;, &#x27;light&#x27;) and the suffix &quot;-og&quot;. The stem &quot;svar&quot; itself was derived from an earlier &quot;*sur&quot; &quot;shining&quot;.

That etymology is also supported by contemporary linguists and etymologists, but the etymology of the stem &quot;svar&quot; can also be explained differently. The root &quot;svar&quot; derives from the Proto-Slavic &quot;*sъvarъ&quot;, which consists of the prefix &quot;*sъ-&quot; meaning &quot;good, (ones&#x27;) own&quot; and the stem &quot;*varъ&quot; &quot;fire, heat&quot;, which is continued, for example, by Old Church Slavonic варъ, &quot;varǔ&quot; (&quot;heat&quot;), or Old East Slavic варъ, &quot;varǔ&quot; &quot;sunny heatwave, scorching heat, heat&quot; (from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*wār-&quot; &quot;warmth&quot;). This root was then extended by the suffix &quot;*-ogъ&quot;, which has no specific function. The common noun &quot;*sъvarogъ&quot; &quot;good, own fire, heat&quot; was then transferred to the name of the god because of his function as a divine blacksmith, a god wielding fire, working with fire.

The &quot;*sъvarъ&quot; stem is also the origin of words related to blacksmithing. Some examples are Old East Slavic сварити, &quot;svariti&quot; &quot;to forge something at high temperature&quot;, Old Polish &quot;zwarzyć&quot; &quot;to weld, chain two pieces of iron&quot;, and modern Russian and Slovenian words (e.g. сварить, &quot;svarit&quot;&#x27;, variti, &quot;to melt&quot;, &quot;to weld&quot;).

Some researchers, including Aleksander Brückner and Vatroslav Jagić, have suggested that the name stemmed from the word &quot;svar&quot; meaning &quot;argument, disagreement&quot;, or the verb &quot;svariti&quot; &quot;to quarrel&quot;. Brückner translated this theonym literally as &quot;wrangler, brawler&quot;, which would also be associated with fire. However, this etymology has been criticized.

In earlier scholarship, the dominant view was that the root &quot;sva&quot;r was borrowed from an Indo-Iranian language (e.g., from Sanskrit स्वर्, &quot;svar&quot; &quot;radiance&quot;, &quot;sky&quot;, &quot;sun&quot;), but this etymology is nowadays rejected due to phonetic difficulties.

== Legacy ==
After Christianization, Svarog was preserved in toponymy and vocabulary. In Bulgaria these are the towns of Сва́рог, &quot;Svarog&quot;, Сва́рошка бара, &quot;Svaroshka bara&quot;, in the Czech Republic it is the &quot;Svaroh&quot; mountain, and the Sorbian name &quot;Zwarogk&quot;. Brückner also added the Polish town of &quot;Swarożyn&quot; here, based on a notation in the German Latin &quot;Swarozino&quot; from 1205, but the original notation was &quot;Swarozina&quot; and is dated 1305, so it should be read as &quot;Swarocino&quot;, from the personal name &quot;Swarota&quot;, or, as other records indicate, the town was called &quot;Swaryszewo&quot;, from the personal name &quot;Swarysz&quot;. Modern notation &quot;Swarożyn&quot; should be regarded as false transcription.

In the Russian dialect (Novgorod) the obsolete word сва́рог, &quot;svarog&quot; meaning &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;blacksmith&quot;, is preserved. The Romanian word &quot;sfarog&quot;, meaning &quot;something burnt, charred, dried&quot;, was probably borrowed from an unspecified South Slavic language, probably Bulgarian, and the source word is reconstructed as &quot;*svarogъ&quot;.

== Svarog-Svarozhits ==

A god named &quot;Svarozhits&quot; appears in the sources as well. Some scholars have suggested that Svarozhits means &#x27;young Svarog&#x27; or is a diminutive of &quot;Svarog&quot;. The argument for the existence of only one god is based on the fact that in Serbo-Croatian the suffix &quot;-ić&quot; means &#x27;young&#x27; or &#x27;small&#x27; (e.g., &quot;Djurdjić&quot; is not the &#x27;son of Djurdjo&#x27;, but &#x27;little Djurdjo&#x27;). Brückner also believed that the Lithuanians called their gods fondly, e.g. &quot;Perkune dievaite&quot; meaning &#x27;little god Perkun&#x27; and not &#x27;god Perkun&#x27;. However, most scholars disagree with this interpretation. The suffix &quot;-its&quot;, &quot;-ich&quot; (from Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot;) is most often a patronymic suffix (e.g. Polish &quot;pan&quot; &#x27;master&#x27; → &quot;panicz&quot; &#x27;son of a master&#x27;). The family relationship between Svarog and Svarozhits is also indicated by accounts of these gods.

== Sources ==
The only source that mentions Svarog is the Slavic translation of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; (&quot;Chronography&quot;) of John Malalas, which was placed in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; under year 1114. In this translation, in glosses, the Greek god of fire and smithing Hephaestus is translated as Svarog, and his son, the sun god Helios, is translated as Dazhbog (glosses are in italics):

This source is problematic for several reasons. The first problem is place and time the glosses about Svarog and Dazhbog were included in the Slavonic translation of the &quot;Chronography&quot;. Some scholars believe that these glosses come from the 10th-century Bulgarian translator of the &quot;Chronography&quot; (the first Slavic translation in general), and some scholars assume that the glosses were added by a Ruthenian copyist. Aleksander Brückner supported this thesis by adding that the Bulgarian texts avoided mentioning Slavic or Turkic paganism in Bulgaria. Vatroslav Jagić suggested that the glosses were written in Novgorod because the &quot;Chronography&quot; translation also contains references to Lithuanian paganism, which the Bulgarian translator could not do. The downside of this theory is that the glosses must have been written before 1118 (this is probably when they first found their way into the compilation of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;), and in the 11th century Ruthenian writers were not interested in Lithuanian paganism because of underdeveloped contacts with Lithuania. For this reason, Viljo Mansikka has proposed that the Baltic interpolation and glosses came into translation in 1262 in Lithuania or Western Rus. However, this explanation raises some objections: Svarog is not mentioned in any other Russian sources (unlike Dazhbog), and he is also omitted by Nikon in his list of deities worshiped by Vladimir the Great. According to Henryk Łowmiański, who identified Svarozhits with Dazhbog, an argument for the Bulgarian origin of the glosses is the fact that in these glosses Dazhbog is called &quot;the son of Svarog&quot; – in Bulgarian the patronymic suffix &quot;-ic&quot;, &quot;-ič&quot; has been forgotten, so that Dazhbog could not be called simply Svarozhits. If the Bulgarian origin of the glosses is recognized, Svarog must also be considered a South Slavic god, not an East Slavic one.

The second problem is that it is not clear which information in the glosses pertains to Slavic mythology and which to Greek mythology. According to the glosses Svarog is: (1) the Slavic equivalent of Hephaestus, the Greek god of fire and smithing, (2) the father of Dazhbog, and (3) the creator of monogamy. According to Andrzej Szyjewski, the myth of the adulterous wife fits Hephaestus (pagan Slavs were polygamous), whereas the myth of the blacksmith god being the father of the Sun does not appear anywhere in Greek mythology. Łowmiański believed that Hephaestus was not translated as Svarog because of his association with fire and smithing, but precisely because of his being the father of the Sun. Brückner and Dimitri Obolensky interpreted this account as a distorted myth about a blacksmith god who forged a sun disk. Such an affinity may be indicated by the Baltic parallel where Teliavelis forges the sun and casts it on the sky.

== Interpretations ==
Because it is unclear to what extent the fragmentary translation of the &quot;Chronography&quot; can be used, and because of only a single source about Svarog, as well as uncertain clues in folklore, the interpretation of this god is problematic. Some scholars have even suggested that Svarog was created from the figure of Svarozhits and never existed in the beliefs of the Slavs.

=== God of fire, blacksmithing, sun ===
Czech historians Martin Pitro and Petr Vokáč believe that Svarog is a god who receded into the background after the creation of the world, but at the same time is a celestial smith and sun god.

It is possible that Svarog echoes the mythology of northern Europe: the smith in Norse and Baltic mythology forges weapons for the Thunderer, and as in Finnish mythology, the smith god Ilmarinen is the creator of the Sun, the sky, and many wondrous objects. The smith god also fights the powers of chaos in defense of his creation.

Aleksander Gieysztor interpreted Svarog as celestial fire (the sun), Perun as atmospheric fire (the thunderbolt), and Svarozhits-Dazhbog as earthly fire (fire).

Jiří Dynda rejects the understanding of Svarog as a sovereign deity of heaven or a &quot;deus otiousus&quot; type deity, and points out that in the source Svarog, or rather his prefiguration, does not bear the characteristics of such a deity, except for the paternity of the solar deity, which he considers a secondary feature. Instead, he compares him to the figure of the magician and hero Volkh Vseslavyevich from Russian bylines, and to the ancient blacksmiths who, in Russian folklore, make weapons for heroes and weld the hair of men and women symbolically uniting them into marriage, which include, for example, the blind father of the hero Svyatogor.

It is possible that Svarog is related in some way to mythological bird Rarog (saker falcon), perhaps on the taboo basis pointed out by Roman Jakobson. In Vedism Indra is sometimes called &quot;Indra Vritrahan&quot;, &quot;Indra the victor of Vritra&quot;. In the Iranian version of this motif, Veretragna is transformed into the falcon &quot;Varhagan&quot; during his duel with Vritra. Czech &quot;Raroh&quot;, &quot;Rarach&quot; is a generous yet vengeful demonic being associated with the campfire, taking the form of a bird or dragon, with a body and hair of flame, who flies out through the chimney as a ball of fire or whirlwind. He indicates a Balto-Slavic motif: the names &quot;raróg&quot;, &quot;rarok&quot; in Polish, &quot;jarog&quot; in Czech, and &quot;raragas&quot; or &quot;vanagas&quot; in Lithuanian refer to a bird with glowing eyes.

=== Sky god ===
On the basis of solar and celestial etymology, Svarog is often interpreted as a celestial creator deity whose role in cult mythology has been overlooked. Svarog would have been the heir of a hypothetical Proto-Indo-European &quot;*Dyḗus&quot;. In this case, he would correspond to deities such as the Vedic Dyaus or the Baltic Dievs, but also to the Greek Zeus or the Roman Jupiter – the latter two deities, however, took on thunderer characteristics and occupied an important place in their respective pantheons.

Michal Téra interprets Svarog as the counterpart of the Vedic sky-god Dyaus, who according to some accounts is the father of the fire-god Agni-Svarozhits and of the sun-god Surya-Dazhbog. He also links him to the mystical figure Svyatogor, whose place in the bylinas is taken by Ilya Muromets, Perun&#x27;s heir – according to Téra described as tired, whose weight the earth cannot bear, and he compares this last motif to the mythical separation of Heaven and Earth which is necessary to put the world in order. He also believes that Svarog appears in the myths of the creation of the world.

Łowmiański developed a theory that the cult of the Proto-Indo-European god &quot;*Dyḗus&quot; developed among the Slavs in two forms: in the form of Svarog among the West Slavs, and in the form of Perun among the East Slavs. Subsequently, the cult of Svarog was to be transported in the 6th century by Serbs and Croats from West Slavs to the Balkans.

<text>Zorya (lit. &quot;Dawn&quot;; also many variants: Zarya, Zaria, Zorza, Zirnytsia, Zaranitsa, Zoryushka, etc.) is a figure in Slavic folklore, a feminine personification of dawn, possibly goddess. Depending on tradition, she may appear as a singular entity, or two or three sisters at once. Although Zorya is etymologically unrelated to the Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn &quot;*H₂éwsōs&quot;, she shares most of her characteristics. She is often depicted as the sister of the Sun, the Moon, and Danica, the Morning Star with which she is sometimes identified. She lives in the Palace of the Sun, opens the gate for him in the morning so that he can set off on a journey through the sky, guards his white horses, she is also described as a virgin. In the Eastern Slavic tradition of zagovory she represents the supreme power that a practitioner appeals to.

== Etymology ==
The Slavic word &quot;zora&quot; &quot;dawn, aurora&quot; (from Proto-Slavic &quot;*zoŗà&quot;), and its variants, comes from the same root as the Slavic word &quot;zrěti&quot; (&quot;to see, observe&quot;, from PS &quot;*zьrěti&quot;), which originally may have meant &quot;shine&quot;. The word &quot;zara&quot; may have originated under the influence of the word &quot;žar&quot; &quot;heat&quot; (PS &quot;*žarь&quot;). PS &quot;*zoŗà&quot; comes from the Proto-Balto-Slavic &quot;*źoriˀ&quot; (cf. Lithuanian &quot;žarà&quot;, &quot;žarijà&quot;), the etymology of the root is unclear.

== Comparative mythology ==

The Proto-Indo-European reconstructed goddess of the dawn is &quot;*H₂éwsōs&quot;. Her name was reconstructed using a comparative method on the basis of the names of Indo-European goddesses of the dawn, e.g. Greek Eos, Roman Aurora, or Vedic Ushas; similarly, on the basis of the common features of the goddesses of the dawn, the features of the Proto-Indo-European goddess were also reconstructed.

Although the Zorya cult is only attested in folklore, its roots go back to Indo-European antiquity, and the Zorya herself manifests most of &quot;*H₂éwsōs&quot; characteristics. Zorya shares the following characteristics with most goddesses of the dawn:

# She appears in the company of St. George and St. Nicholas (interpreted as divine twins)
# Red, gold, yellow, rose colors
# She lives overseas, on the island of Buyan
# Opens the door to the Sun
# She owned a golden boat and a silver oar
L.A. Zarubin, who was a Slavonic scholar of the 20th century, undertook a comparison between Slavic folklore and the Indo-Aryan &quot;Rigveda&quot; and &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;, where images of the Sun and its companions, the Dawns, have been preserved. These images date back to ancient concepts from the initially fetishistic (the Sun in the form of a ring or circle) to the later anthropomorphic. Chludov&#x27;s Novgorod Psalter of the late 13th century contains a miniature depicting two women. One of them, fiery red, signed as &quot;morning zorya&quot;, holds a red sun in her right hand in the form of a ring, and in her left hand she holds a torch resting on her shoulder, ending in a box from which emerges a light green stripe passing into dark green. This stripe ends in another woman&#x27;s right hand, in green, signed as &quot;evening zorya&quot;, with a bird emerging from her left sleeve. This should be interpreted as the Morning Zorya releasing the Sun on its daily journey, and at sunset the Evening Zorya awaits to meet the Sun. A very similar motif was found in a cave temple from the 2nd or 3rd century AD in Nashik, India. The bas-relief depicts two women: one using a torch to light the circle of the Sun, and the other expecting it at sunset. Some other bas-reliefs depict two goddesses of the dawn, Ushas and Pratyusha, and the Sun, accompanied by Dawns, appears in several hymns. The Sun in the form of a wheel appears in the Indo-Aryan &quot;Rigveda&quot;, or the Norse &quot;Edda&quot;, as well as in folklore: during the annual festivals of the Germanic peoples and Slavs, they lit a wheel which, according to medieval authors, was supposed to symbolize the sun.

Similar images to the one from the Psalter and the Nashik appear in various parts of Slavic lands, e.g. On a carved and painted gate of a Slovak peasant estate (village of Očová): on one of the pillars is carved the Morning Zorya, with a golden head, above her is a glow, and even higher is the Sun, which rolls along an arched road, and on the other pillar is carved the Evening Zorya, above it is a setting sun. There are also darkened suns on this relief, possibly &quot;dead suns&quot; appearing in Slavic folklore. These motifs are also confirmed by the Russian saying &quot;The sun will not rise without the Morning Zoryushka&quot;. Such a motif was also found on the back of a 19th-century sled where the Sun, in the form of a circle, is in the palace and two Zoryas stand in the exit, and on a peasant rushnyk from the Tver region where Zoryas on horseback rides up to the Sun, one is red and the other is green.

===Baltic mythology===
According to scholarship, Lithuanian folklore attests a similar dual role for luminous deities Vakarine and Ausrine: Vakarine, the Evening Star, made the bed for solar goddess Saulė, and Aušrinė, the Morning Star, lit the fire for her as she prepared for another day&#x27;s journey. In other accounts, Ausrine and Vakarine are said to be daughters of the female Sun (Saule) and male Moon (Meness), and they tend their mother&#x27;s palace and horses.

== Russian tradition ==
In Russian tradition, they often appear as two virgin sisters: Zorya Utrennyaya (Morning Zorya, from &quot;útro&quot; &quot;morning&quot;) as the goddess of dawn, and Zorya Vechernyaya (Evening Aurora, from &quot;véčer&quot; &quot;evening&quot;) as the goddess of dusk. Each was to stand on a different side of the golden throne of the Sun. The Morning Zorya opened the gate of the heavenly palace when the Sun set out in the morning, and the Evening Zorya closed the gate when the Sun returned to his abode for the night. The headquarters of Zorya was to be located on Buyan Island.

A myth from a later period speaks of three Zoryas and their special task:

===In folk incantations and popular medicine===
&quot;Zara-Zaranitsa Krasnaya Devitsa&quot; (aka &quot;Dawn the Red Maiden&quot;) appears interchangeably with Maria (Mother of God) in different versions of the same zagovory plots as the supreme power that a practitioner applies to.

She was also prayed to as Zarya for good harvests and health:

Professor Bronislava Kerbelytė cited that in Russian tradition, the Zoryas were also invoked to help in childbirth (with the appellation &quot;зорки заряночки&quot;) and to treat the baby (calling upon &quot;заря-девица&quot;, or &quot;утренняя заря Параскавея&quot; and &quot;вечерняя заря Соломонея&quot;).

Zarya was also invoked as protectress and to dispel nightmares and sleeplessness:

:Заря, зарница, васъ три сестрицы, утренняя, полуденная, вечерняя, полуночная, сыми съ раба Божія (имя) тоску, печаль, крикъ, безсонницу, подай ему сонъ со всѣхъ сторонъ, со всѣхъ святыхъ, со всѣхъ небесныхъ.

In another incantation, Zarya-Zarnitsa is invoked along with a &quot;morning Irina&quot; and a &quot;Midday Daria&quot; to dispel a child&#x27;s sadness and take it away &quot;beyond the blue ocean&quot;.

===Further attestation===
Croatian historian Natko Nodilo noted in his study &quot;The Ancient Faith of the Serbs and the Croats&quot; that the ancient Slavs saw Zora as a &quot;shining maiden&quot; (&quot;&quot;svijetla&quot; i &quot;vidna&quot; djevojka&quot;), and Russian riddles described her as a maiden that lived in the sky (&quot;Zoru nebesnom djevojkom&quot;).

As for the parentage of the Dawn, she is referred &quot;in a Russian song&quot; as &quot;dear little Dawn&quot; and as the &quot;Sister of the Sun&quot;.

== Belarusian tradition ==
In Belarusian folklore she appears as Zaranitsa (Зараніца) or as Zara-zaranitsa (Зара-Зараніца). In one of the passages, Zaranica is met by St. George and St. Nicholas, who, according to comparative mythology, function as divine twins, who in Indo-European mythologies are usually brothers of the goddess of the dawn: &quot;Saint George was walking with Saint Nicholas and met Aurora&quot;.

In folklore she also appears in the form of a riddle:

This is about the dew, which the moon does not react to and which disappears under the influence of the sun. &quot;Zara&quot; is probably simply the goddess of the dawn, and can be translated literally as &quot;Dawn&quot;, and &quot;Zaranica&quot; is a diminutive and may indicate respect towards her.

In Belarusian tradition, the stars are sometimes referred to as &quot;zorki&quot; and &quot;zory&quot;, such as the star Polaris, known as &quot;Zorny Kol&quot; (&#x27;star pole&#x27;) and &quot;polunochna zora&quot; (&#x27;star of midnight&#x27;).

== Polish tradition ==
In Polish folklore, there are three sister Zoras (&quot;Trzy Zorze&quot;): Morning Zorza (Polish: &quot;Zorza porankowa&quot; or &quot;Utrenica&quot;), Midday Zora (&quot;Zorza południowa&quot; or &quot;Południca&quot;) and Evening Zora (&quot;Zorza wieczorowa&quot; or &quot;Wieczornica&quot;), which appear in Polish folk charms and, according to Andrzej Szyjewski, represent a threefold division of the day. They also function as Rozhanitsy:
Another folk saying from Poland is thus: &quot;Żarze, zarzyczki, jest was trzy, zabierzcie od mojego dziecka płakanie, przywróćcie mu spanie&quot;.

In a magical love charm from Poland, the girl asks for the dawn (or morning-star) to go to the girl&#x27;s beloved and force him to love no other but her:

:&quot;Witajze zorze&quot;
:&quot;Welcome, morning star&quot;

== Ukrainian tradition ==
Ukrainian also has words deriving from &quot;*zoŗà&quot;: зі́рка (dialectal зі́ра &quot;zira&quot; and зі́ри &quot;ziry&quot;) &quot;zírka&quot;, a diminutive meaning &#x27;little star&#x27;, &#x27;starlet&#x27;, &#x27;asterisk&#x27;; зі́рнйця &quot;zirnitsa&quot; (or зі́рнйці &quot;zirnytsi&quot;, a poetic term meaning &#x27;little star&#x27;, &#x27;aurora, dawn&#x27;.

In a saying collected in &quot;Харківщині&quot; (Kharkiv Oblast), it is said that &quot;there are many stars (Зірок) in the sky, but there are only two Zori: the morning one (світова) and the evening one (вечірня)&quot;.

In an orphan&#x27;s lament, the mourner says she will take the &quot;keys of the dawn&quot; (&quot;То я б в зорі ключі взяла&quot;).

In a magical love charm, the girl invokes &quot;three star-sisters&quot; (or the &quot;dawn-sisters&quot;):

:&quot;Vy zori-zirnytsi, vas na nebi tri sestrytsi: odna nudna, druga pryvitna, a tretia pechal&#x27;na&quot;
:&quot;You dawn-stars, you three sisters in the sky: one dull, the second welcoming, and the third sorrowful&quot;
Zorya also patronized marriages, as manifested by her frequent appearance in wedding songs, and arranged marriages between the gods. In one of the folk songs, where the Moon meets Aurora while wandering in the sky, she is directly attributed this function:

==Slovene tradition==
In a Slovene folksong titled &quot;Zorja prstan pogubila&quot; (Zorja lost her ring), the singer asks for mother (&quot;majka&quot;), brother (&quot;bratec&quot;), sister (&quot;sestra&quot;) and darling (&quot;dragi&quot;) to look for it.

According to Monika Kropej, in Slovene mythopoetic tradition, the sun rises in the morning, accompanied by the morning dawn, named Sončica (from &quot;sonce&quot; &#x27;sun&#x27;), and sets in the evening joined by an evening dawn named Zarika (from &quot;zarja&quot; &#x27;dawn&#x27;). These female characters also appear in a Slovenian narrative folk song about their rivalry. Fanny Copeland also interpreted both characters as mythological Sun and Dawn, as well as mentioned another ballad, titled &quot;Ballad of Beautiful Zora&quot;. Slovene folklorist Jakob Kelemina (sl), in his book about Slovene myths and folk-tales, stated that a Zora appears as the daughter of the Snake Queen (possibly an incarnation of the night) in the so-called &quot;Kresnik Cycle&quot;.

==East Slavic tradition==
According to professor Daiva Vaitkevičienė, the Virgin Mary most likely replaced deity Zaria in East Slavic charms. The Virgin Mary is also addressed as &quot;Zaria&quot; in Russian charms.

In a charm collected in Arkhangelsky and published in 1878 by historian , the announcer invokes зоря Мария and заря Маремъяния, translated as &quot;Maria-the-Dawn&quot; and &quot;Maremiyaniya-the-Dawn&quot;.

In another charm, the &quot;Evening Star Mariya&quot; and &quot;Morning Star Maremiyana&quot; are invoked to take away sleeplessness.

==Slavic tradition==
Goddess Zaria (alternatively, a trio of deities named Zori) is also invoked in charms against illness. According to professor Daiva Vaitkevičienė, this &quot;is a very popular motif of the Slavic charms&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The word &quot;Zorya&quot; has become a loanword in Romanian as its word for &quot;dawn&quot; (&quot;zori&quot;) and as the name of a piece of music sung by colindători (&quot;zorile&quot;).

The Morning Star is also known as &quot;dennica&quot;, &quot;zornica&quot; or &quot;zarnica&quot;.

In Serbo-Croatian, the planet Venus is known as &quot;Zornjača&quot;, when it appears in the morning, and &quot;Večernjača&quot; when it appears at night.

In a folksong, the Dawn/Morning Star is depicted as the bride of a male Moon.

In some Croatian folk songs, collected and published in 1876 by Rikardo Ferdinand Plohl-Herdvigov, a &quot;zorja&quot; is used along with &quot;Marja&quot; in &quot;Zorja Marja prsten toči&quot;; and referred to as &quot;Zorja, zorija&quot; in &quot;Marija sinku načinila košulju&quot;;

== Zorya in culture ==
* Popular folk song &quot;Zoryushka&quot; (&quot;Зорюшка&quot;) sung on a wedding day.
* In the 2001 novel &quot;American Gods&quot;, and its 2017 television adaptation, author Neil Gaiman depicts Zorya as a triple goddess: Zorya Utrennyaya (morning star), Zorya Polunochnaya (midnight star), and Zorya Vechernyaya (evening star).
* Zorya appears in &quot;The Iron Druid Chronicles&quot; by Kevin Hearne.
* One of the works by Australian composer Julian Cochran is named &quot;Zorya Vechernyay&quot;a.
* One of the albums by Czech composer Floex is called &quot;Zorya&quot;, and the last number on the album is called &quot;Zorya Polunochnaya&quot;.
* Zorya figures prominently in the game &quot;Eve Online&quot; as the leader of the invading precursor entity, the Triglavian Collective.

<doc id="380644" wikidata="Q1742896" url="?curid=380644" title="William Bridges (general)">
<text>Major General Sir William Throsby Bridges, (18 February 1861 – 18 May 1915) was a senior Australian Army officer who was instrumental in establishing the Royal Military College, Duntroon and who served as the first Australian Chief of the General Staff. During the First World War he commanded the 1st Australian Division at Gallipoli, where he died of wounds on 18 May 1915, becoming the first Australian general officer to be killed during the war. He was the first Australian officer—and the first graduate of Kingston—to reach the rank of major general, the first to command a division, and the first to receive a knighthood. He is one of only two Australians killed in action in the Great War to be interred in Australia.

==Early life==
Bridges was born on 18 February 1861 in Greenock, Scotland, the son of William Wilson Somerset Bridges, a Royal Navy captain, and his Australian wife, Mary Hill Throsby. He was educated at Ryde on the Isle of Wight, before attending the Royal Naval School at New Cross, London, in 1871. He remained there until mid-1872 when his family moved to Canada, after his father was badly injured in an accident and forced to retire from the navy. For the next three years, Bridges was a boarder at the Trinity College School, at Port Hope, Ontario. On 10 April 1877, at the age of 16, he entered the newly established Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston as part of the college&#x27;s second intake, and was assigned the student number 25.

Although tall, Bridges was of slight build and was not noted for his involvement in sport while at the college, spending most of his spare time reading; nevertheless, he became a keen canoeist as a cadet. Although he was a good student, he became unsettled and began failing his courses when his family migrated to Australia leaving him in Kingston. In June 1879, having received his Certificate of Military Qualifications, Bridges was permitted to leave the college, becoming its first drop out after his father paid a $100 fine to withdraw him. Travelling on the transport &quot;Zealandia&quot;, Bridges arrived in Sydney in August and joined his family who had settled in his mother&#x27;s home town of Moss Vale, New South Wales. Shortly after his arrival, he began working for the Department of Roads and Bridges at Braidwood, and by 1884 he had become an inspector in the Narrabri district.

==Military career==
===Early career and Boer War ===
In early 1885, in response to the fall of Khartoum and the death of General Charles Gordon during the British campaign against the Dervish revolt in Sudan, the colony of New South Wales raised a military contingent consisting of an infantry battalion, with artillery and supporting units, for service with the British. In an effort to enlist, Bridges travelled to Sydney from Narrabri, but by the time he had arrived, the force had already been raised. Nevertheless, due to concerns about Russian intentions in Afghanistan, the Australian colonies began expanding their military forces, and on 19 May that year he was commissioned as a lieutenant into the New South Wales Artillery. Initially his appointment was only temporary, but he was later offered a permanent position.

The following year Bridges undertook an artillery officers&#x27; course at the School of Gunnery at Middle Head, after which he was posted there as a staff officer. In 1889 he qualified as a gunnery instructor and in October 1890, having been promoted to captain the month before, he was sent to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and to the Royal School of Gunnery at Shoeburyness for training. Upon returning to Australia in 1893 he became Chief Instructor at the Middle Head School of Gunnery. He was promoted to major in September 1895, and he held positions on several military committees and conferences. In late 1899 Bridges became one of four New South Wales officers seconded to serve with British Army units during the Second Boer War. During his time in South Africa he took part in actions around Kimberley, Paardeberg and Driefontein before contracting typhoid. After being evacuated to England, he returned to Australia in September 1900.

Upon his return, Bridges took command of the Brigade Division of Field Artillery as well as holding various staff appointments. In 1901 the Australian colonies federated, and the various colonial military forces coalesced into the Australian Army. Bridges undertook a quick succession of appointments: Assistant Quartermaster General of the Army HQ in Melbourne; Chief of Military Intelligence; Chief of the Australian General Staff, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel in July 1902 and then colonel in October 1906. In 1909, he went to London as Australia&#x27;s representative on the Imperial General Staff.

In 1910 Bridges was promoted to brigadier general and, on the recommendation of Lord Kitchener, was recalled to Australia to become the first commandant of the Royal Military College at Duntroon. On his way back to Australia, Bridges inspected various military academies, including Sandhurst, Woolwich, and West Point. He chose the site of the old Campbell homestead and in line with Kitchener&#x27;s recommendations, Bridges largely modelled Duntroon on the United States Military Academy at West Point. He remained commandant of the college until May 1914, when he was appointed Inspector General of the Army.

===First World War===
When war broke out, Bridges was in Queensland on an inspection tour, and he returned to Melbourne on 5 August 1914. He met the Australian cabinet, was promoted to the rank of major general, and was charged with the creation of an expeditionary force of 20,000 men for overseas service, known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). As this force was raised, Bridges convinced the government to graduate the first class of Duntroon cadets early. Once the force was raised, Bridges and his command sailed from Albany, Western Australia and Fremantle, Western Australia in late October, bound for England, where they were to undertake a period of training before being committed to the fighting on the Western Front. En route, the destination was changed from England to Egypt, where they landed on 1 December. In Egypt, Bridges set to work training his troops, which were organised as the 1st Australian Division. On 25 April, as part the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, Bridges&#x27; command was among the first ashore at Anzac Cove, at the start of the Gallipoli campaign.

After the initial landing, the Australian and New Zealand troops established a beachhead around Anzac Cove, but during early May a period of stalemate followed as the Turkish defenders prevented them from advancing inland. Bridges suggested withdrawing the force, but he was over-ruled. During this time, Bridges inspected the front lines on a daily basis, despite the risks. On 15 May 1915, he was shot through the femoral artery in his right leg by a Turkish sniper. Dragged to safety, he was evacuated to the hospital ship &quot;Gascon&quot;. Infection set in but amputation was deemed impossible since he had lost so much blood. On 17 May 1915, Bridges was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, although the award was not formally gazetted until 22 May. He was also posthumously Mentioned in Despatches, having died on board the hospital ship on 18 May.

Bridges was buried in Alexandria but in June his body was returned to Melbourne where he received a state funeral. Bridges is the only identified Australian killed in the First World War to have had his body repatriated and buried on Australian soil. His funeral service was conducted at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne. He was buried on 3 September 1915 at Duntroon on the slopes of Mount Pleasant.

==Personal life==
On 10 October 1885, Bridges married Edith Lilian Francis (1862–1926), daughter of Alfred John Dawson Francis and Margaret Agnes Anne Francis (formerly Wilson, born Green) at St John&#x27;s Church, Darlinghurst, New South Wales, which was the same church in which his parents had married in 1858. They had seven children, three of whom died young. Bridges was survived by Edith and their four living children; one of his sons, William Francis, later followed in his footsteps, serving on the Western Front, achieving the rank of major in the AIF and receiving the Distinguished Service Order.

He was also survived by his horse &quot;Sandy&quot;, the only Australian Waler horse to return from the First World War, due to quarantine restrictions. It is not clear when Bridges met Sandy but after his death Sandy was cared for by a number of Army vets until, by order of the Minister of Defence, the horse was returned to Australia where he lived at the Remount Depot at Maribyrnong, before being put down in 1923 due to ill health.

==Legacy==
Sir William Throsby Bridges is memorialised by a memorial tablet in the Anglican Church of St John the Baptist, in Canberra, where his wife is buried. The tablet was unveiled on 9 December 1930, on the final Duntroon graduation day before the college temporarily moved to Victoria Barracks, in Sydney, having been paid for by subscriptions from former AIF officers. His epitaph reads: &quot;Major General Sir William Throsby Bridges KCB CMG died on 18 May 1915 from wounds received at Gallipoli peninsula whilst in command of the Australian Imperial Force. A gallant and erudite soldier, he was the first commandant of this College, where in recognition of faithful service his remains were publicly interred on Third September 1915&quot;. As an ex- Kingston cadet, Bridges&#x27; name is also listed on the Memorial Arch at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, and he is commemorated on the Canadian Virtual War Memorial and on page 566 of the Canadian First World War Book of Remembrance.

<doc id="380649" wikidata="Q6388934" url="?curid=380649" title="Kendall Square">
<text>Kendall Square is a neighborhood in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. The square itself is at the intersection of Main Street and Broadway. It also refers to the broad business district east of Portland Street, northwest of the Charles River, north of MIT and south of Binney Street. 

Kendall Square has been called &quot;the most innovative square mile on the planet&quot;, in reference to the high concentration of entrepreneurial start-ups and quality of innovation which have emerged in the vicinity of the square since 2010.

The neighborhood has approximately 50,000 people who work in the area on a daily basis and a growing residential population.

==Industrial district (c.1800–1990) ==

Originally a salt marsh on the Charles River between Boston and Cambridge, Kendall Square has been an important transportation hub since the construction of the West Boston Bridge in 1793, which provided the first direct wagon route between the two settlements. By 1810, the Broad Canal had been dug, which would connect with a system of smaller canals in this East Cambridge seaport area.

From 1880 to 1910, the eastern part of Cambridge hosted a variety of industries, including &quot;printing and publishing, musical instruments (especially organs and pianos), furniture, clothing, carpenters work, soap and candles, and biscuit making.&quot; Heavy machinery was also produced here. Cambridge was once the third-largest pork packer in the US.

One of these factories was the Kendall Boiler and Tank Company. The square was named after the company, which in turn was named after one of its owners, Edward Kendall. The square itself consisted of the triangle defined by Main Street, Broadway, and the short stretch of Third Street between them, now the site of the &quot;&quot; fountain and the surrounding plaza.

When the Longfellow Bridge replaced the West Boston Bridge in 1907, it included provisions for a future rapid-transit subway link to Harvard Square and Boston (now the Red Line); the original Kendall subway station was opened in 1912. In 1916, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology moved from its original campus in Back Bay, Boston, to its new Cambridge campus, located south of Kendall Square between Main Street and Massachusetts Avenue. Since then, the proximity of MIT, whose campus eventually expanded into Kendall Square, has influenced much of the development of the area, and contributed to its development as a technology hub.

World War I consumed a great deal of Cambridge&#x27;s production. After the war, other products were also produced: &quot;soap, rubber goods, books, metal products, electrical equipment, furniture, ink, pianos, candy and ice cream&quot;. The Boston Woven Hose company and Lever Brothers were major employers, and Cambridge became the second-largest industrial city in Massachusetts.

After World War II, manufacturing stagnated, and from 1945 to 1965, the heaviest industries—&quot;food, chemicals, rubber, plastics, machinery&quot;—declined by 30-50%. At the same time, technical work grew by 35%.

In 1961, after announcing the American effort to land a man on the moon, President John F. Kennedy (a Massachusetts native) wanted to make Cambridge the site of NASA&#x27;s newly expanded mission control center. Kennedy allowed his vice president Lyndon B. Johnson (a native Texan) to choose Houston, Texas for the complex, now the Johnson Spaceflight Center. To mark the beginning of construction, Kennedy would give his &quot;We choose to go to the Moon&quot; speech in Houston, not Cambridge. (A Cambridge urban legend is that the Kennedy assassination is what moved Mission Control from Cambridge to Houston, but this is untrue.)

In 1964, Kendall Square got a much smaller NASA Electronic Research Center instead. President Richard M. Nixon would shut it down only five years later.

Former Massachusetts Governor John A. Volpe, who served as US Secretary of Transportation (DOT) from 1969 to 1973, succeeded in getting the former NASA buildings rededicated to a new DOT research center, which was later named the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in his memory. For the next twenty years, other large parcels of Kendall Square, which had also been cleared in anticipation of a much larger NASA complex, were an unoccupied post-industrial wasteland.

Another contribution came when Harvard University announced plans to construct a high-containment lab in which it would experiment with recombinant DNA. Opposition from Cambridge mayor Alfred Vellucci resulted in the city council passing a three-month moratorium and convening a citizen&#x27;s committee to study the issue. The resulting regulations passed in 1977 by the council provided certainty for research and development organizations, and led to the creation of the Kendall biotechnology cluster. The first companies taking advantage of this were Harvard spin-off Genetics Institute (which ended up in Cambridge after opposition in Boston and Somerville, and which would eventually become part of Pfizer), and Biogen, which located in the city in 1982.

==Office, research, retail, and housing developments (1990–present) ==

In the 1990s and 2000s, the area northeast of Kendall, in the direction of the then-new CambridgeSide Galleria shopping mall was transformed from an industrial area into a collection of office and research buildings, housing over 150 biotechnology and information technology firms . In 1997, the surviving industrial buildings between Third, Binney, Fifth, and Rogers Streets were declared the Blake and Knowles Steam Pump Company National Register District.

High technology firms are lured in part by the proximity of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) campus on the south side of Main Street. MIT owns a significant amount of the commercial real estate in the square, and has been actively constructing space for new high-tech tenants as well as rebuilding its own facilities fronting Main Street. Nearby MIT facilities include the Stata Center and the MIT Sloan School of Management, as well as many other buildings of the eastern end of the MIT campus.

The Cambridge Center office development is closest to the junction of Main Street and Broadway and the MBTA subway station at the traditional core of Kendall Square. On December 2, 1982, the Kendall/MIT subway station was renamed &quot;Cambridge Center/MIT&quot;, although few signs were changed to reflect this. There were many complaints that the MBTA had suddenly changed the name without public input, and that the new name would be confused with the next Red Line station at Central Square. On June 26, 1985, the name was reverted to Kendall/MIT.

The Cambridge Innovation Center, a shared office space for startups and venture capital firms founded by Tim Rowe and currently occupied by almost 400 small startup businesses, is also close by at One Broadway. Google, Facebook, and IBM have research labs located in or immediately adjacent to Kendall Square.

Many other high technology firms are in two nearby multi-building office complex parks, both located about a from the traditional hub of Kendall Square. To the west, Technology Square is directly behind the main campus of MIT, and once housed its computer research labs. The confusingly-named One Kendall Square complex is located between Broadway and Binney Street (across from Landmark&#x27;s Kendall Square Cinema, a small cineplex), northwest of the traditional Kendall Square hub.

The &quot;@Kendall Square&quot; development is located one block north of Kendall Square, and includes a mixed-use &quot;live, work, play&quot; community that weaves parks, an ice rink, a farmers market, and a recreational boating basin through a series of office, lab, residential and retail buildings. Buildings within the @Kendall Square development have won numerous design awards including the AIA California Council&#x27;s 2004 Architectural Design Merit Award, the Boston Society of Architects&#x27; 2004 Interior Architecture/Interior Design Honor Award, the Chicago Athenaeum 2004 American Architecture Award, the AIA 2004 Excellence in Sustainable Design Award, and the AIA COTE 2004 Top Ten Green Projects Award.

In 2016, the City of Cambridge approved MIT&#x27;s plans for six major buildings with floorspace totaling as part of its &quot;Kendall Square Initiative&quot; development. One building, at 314 Main Street, will have as a principal tenant, the Boeing Company, which will lease of lab and office space.

By 2014, a U.S. Department of Transportation building complex and its surrounding parking lots and open land at the western end of Kendall Square constituted one of the largest remaining areas not already subject to 21st century development. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; published an article describing possible plans to repurpose the DOT property for future redevelopment, which would require federal approval for relocation of the DOT center, probably to a more-compact building with underground parking. A related article described some ideas on how to use the DOT land more effectively.

In January 2017, MIT signed an agreement with the federal government to purchase the site of the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in Kendall Square, for $750 million. As a part of the agreement, MIT will build a new replacement research facility for the Department of Transportation, before demolishing the existing building for redevelopment of the entire parcel. Long-term planning has begun for the site, which is not expected to accelerate development until the Kendall Square Initiative construction has largely been completed.

==Businesses and organizations==

The Kendall Square Association is the official business and civic development organization for Kendall Square, and was formed by approximately 80 organizations in February 2009. Its motto is &quot;We share more than a future, we share a sidewalk&quot;. It has developed and distributed a free &quot;Kendall Square Walking Map&quot; showing destinations and attractions within a 10-minute walking radius from Kendall/MIT station.

Several hotels are located in Kendall Square, including the Boston Marriott Cambridge, the Cambridge Residence Inn, and the Kendall Hotel, and several more hotels are located within walking distance. There have also been several large condominium and rental developments, greatly expanding the residential population of the area. , MIT is building residences for 450 graduate students, plus 290 affordable or market-rate units.

The MIT branch of the Harvard/MIT Cooperative Society (&quot;The Coop&quot;) has for decades operated a modest department store and general bookstore at 325 Main Street, as Kendall Square&#x27;s largest retailer. In February 2019, the store moved to smaller temporary quarters at 80 Broadway, to allow for demolition of the building housing its former location. A new, taller 16-story building will be constructed on the site, and the Coop is expected to move into a space larger than its temporary quarters, but possibly smaller than its previous space at that location.

In December 2017, Roche Bros and MIT agreed to put a supermarket in the center of the Kendall business and residential district. The store, opened in November 2019 at One Broadway, is a small-format &quot;Brothers Marketplace&quot; which offers fresh, to-go, and prepared foods.

For decades, the MIT Press Bookstore was a regional attraction in the heart of Kendall Square, offering a complete selection of Press titles for browsing and retail purchase, plus a large selection of complementary works from other academic and trade publishers, including magazines and academic journals. Starting in October 2016, the Bookstore was temporarily relocated to Central Square, just north of the previous location of the MIT Museum, because of extensive construction on its former site. In 2022, the Bookstore moved into a new building at 314 Main Street, adjacent to an existing subway entrance to Kendall/MIT station. Sharing the same building, in 2022 the MIT Museum moved to Kendall Square for the first time, including a newly expanded museum store.

===Resident diplomatic missions===

==Transportation access==
Kendall/MIT station on the MBTA Red Line is located along Main Street directly beneath Kendall Square. MBTA bus routes 64, 68, 85 and CT2 also stop here, as well as the EZRide shuttle between Cambridgeport and North Station, and a free shuttle to the CambridgeSide Galleria Mall.

==Public art==

A popular public artwork is the &quot;Kendall Band&quot;, an interactive sound sculpture by Paul Matisse, located in the Kendall/MIT subway station underground in the heart of the Square.

A bronze fountain sculpture, &quot;&quot; by MIT professor Joe Davis, is installed at the junction of Main Street and Broadway in the Square. The fountain was designed to have flowing water and to emit low-temperature steam, but has been partially or completely non-operational for years at a time.

Small stainless-steel bicycle parking racks have been installed on sidewalks in the area, with various science-themed shapes, such as a sine wave or a caffeine molecule. They were commissioned in 2012 from five local artists after a public competition run by the City of Cambridge.

<doc id="380654" wikidata="Q1461681" url="?curid=380654" title="Stars on 45">
<text>Stars on 45 was a Dutch novelty pop act that was successful in Europe, the United States and Australia in the early 1980s. The group later shortened its name to Stars On in the U.S., while in the U.K. and Ireland, it was always known as Starsound (or Star Sound). The band, which consisted solely of studio session musicians under the direction of Jaap Eggermont, formerly of Golden Earring, recorded medley recordings made by recreating hit songs as faithfully as possible and joining them together with a common tempo and underlying drum track.

==History==

Willem van Kooten, the managing director of the Dutch publishing company Red Bullet Productions, visited a record store and happened to hear a disco medley being played there. The medley combined original recordings of songs by the Beatles, the Buggles, the Archies and Madness with a number of recent American and British disco hits like Lipps Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Funkytown&quot;, Heatwave&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, and The S.O.S. Band&#x27;s &quot;Take Your Time (Do It Right)&quot;, as the rhythms of the various songs tended to complement and &quot;dovetail&quot; into each other. 

When van Kooten heard that the medley also used a segment of &quot;Venus&quot;, a 1970 US #1 hit by Dutch band Shocking Blue — a song for which he himself held the worldwide copyright — and knowing that neither he nor Red Bullet Productions had given the permission for the use of the recording, he realised that the medley in fact was a bootleg release. 

The record turned out to be a 12-inch single called &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It in the 80&#x27;s Great Hits&quot;, credited to a nonexistent band called Passion and issued on a nonexistent record label called Alto. The medley had its origin in Montreal, Canada, and it was later revealed that it was the work of one Michel Ali, together with two professional DJs, Michel Gendreau and Paul Richer. Gendreau and Richer both specialised in the art of &quot;splicing&quot;, stringing together snippets of music from different genres, in varying keys and BPMs from different sound sources, at this time still predominantly from vinyl records. The first version of the medley was eight minutes long, and it included parts from some twenty tracks of which only three were by the Beatles: &quot;No Reply&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Back&quot;, and &quot;Drive My Car&quot;. A later extended, 16-minute, 30-track mix of the same medley labeled &quot;Bits and Pieces III&quot; added another five Beatles titles: &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot;, &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Lose That Girl&quot;. 

===First single personnel and recording===

With the bootleg recording obviously already circulating in dance clubs on both sides of the Atlantic, van Kooten decided to &quot;bootleg the bootleg&quot; and create a licensed version of the medley by using soundalike artists to replicate the original hits and therefore contacted his friend and colleague Jaap Eggermont. The Beatles soundalikes were established Dutch singers. John Lennon&#x27;s parts were sung by of the 1970s Dutch pop group Smyle. Paul McCartney&#x27;s and George Harrison&#x27;s parts were sung by Sandy Coast frontman and , who had worked with Vermeulen in the band . Apart from the recreated songs, an original chorus and hook written and composed by Eggermont and musical arranger Martin Duiser called &quot;Stars on 45&quot; was added at intervals to help string differing sections together. The &#x27;45&#x27; in the title refers to the playback speed of a vinyl record single — 45 rpm; such singles were often simply called &quot;45s&quot;. The female vocals in the chorus were performed by session singer . Later recordings also featured uncredited vocals by Dutch 1970s star Albert West and of the rock revival band . The Stars on 45 recordings were made before the birth of digital recording technology, which meant that each song was recorded separately and the different parts were subsequently manually pieced together with a pre-recorded drumloop, using analog master tapes, in order to create the segued medleys. The specific drumloop heard on most Stars on 45 recordings is often referred to as the &quot;clap track&quot;, due to its prominent and steady handclaps.

The first such release was an 11:30 12&quot; single, issued in the aftermath of the so-called anti-disco backlash, and was released on the (at the time) minor label CNR Records in the Netherlands in December 1980. The single was simply entitled &quot;Stars on 45 Medley&quot; by Stars on 45, with no credits on the label or the cover as to who actually sang on the recording. When Dutch radio stations began playing the four-minute, eight-track Beatles segment of the medley, placed in the middle of the original, 12&quot; mix, an edited 7&quot; single with the Beatles part preceded by &quot;Venus&quot; and The Archies&#x27;s &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; was released and hit the #1 spot of the Dutch singles charts in February 1981. A few months later, it also reached #2 in the UK, where it was released by the British subsidiary of CBS Records and credited to &#x27;Starsound&#x27;. 

In June 1981, the single went to #1 in the US, where it was released by Radio Records, a sublabel of Atlantic Records. The track list for the 7&quot; edit of the &quot;Stars on 45 Medley&quot; in the US was the names of all the songs that make up the medley as it appears on the actual record label:

This single with its 41-word title continues to hold the record for a #1 single with the longest name on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, due to the legalities requiring each song title be listed.

===Follow-up releases and album===

Shortly thereafter, Eggermont created the first Stars on 45 album, &quot;Long Play Album&quot;, issued with an equally anonymous album cover and featuring a 16-minute side-long medley of the Beatles titles. The Stars on 45 &quot;Long Play Album&quot; (US title: &quot;Stars on Long Play&quot;; UK title: &quot;Stars on 45 — The Album&quot;) also became a massive seller worldwide, topping both the UK and Australian album charts, it was a Top 10 hit in most parts of Europe and also reached #9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s album chart in the US. The popularity of the album even resulted in it being given an official release in the Soviet Union, where it was issued by state-owned record label Melodiya under the title &quot;Discothèque Stars&quot;. The &quot;Stars on 45 Medley&quot; single was later awarded a platinum disc for one million copies sold in the US alone.

A second Beatles medley went to #67 on the US charts. Another album followed later that same year, &quot;Longplay Album – Volume II&quot; (US title: &quot;Stars on Long Play II&quot;; UK title: &quot;Stars on 45 — The Album — Volume 2&quot;), featuring medleys using the songs of ABBA, a #2 hit in the UK and Motown, a #55 hit in the US. The recordings of the &quot;Stars on 45&quot; medleys were also made before the advent of modern synthesizers with the possibility of sampling sounds. Consequently, for the recreation of tracks like the themes from &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, included in the &quot;Star Wars and Other Hits&quot; medley on &quot;Longplay Album — Volume II&quot; and released as the third European single under the title &quot;Volume III&quot;, a full symphony orchestra was used, including strings, brass, woodwind, harpsichord, orchestral percussion like timpani etc. — even if those particular parts were only ten or fifteen seconds long on the actual record released.

In late 1981, Eggermont and Martin Duiser were awarded the Conamus Export Prize in the Netherlands in recognition of their contributions to Dutch culture and economy.

A third album, &quot;The Superstars&quot; (US title: &quot;Stars on Long Play III&quot;; UK title: &quot;Stars Medley&quot;), featured medleys of the Rolling Stones and Stevie Wonder. The single &quot;Stars on 45 III: A Tribute to Stevie Wonder&quot; peaked at #28 in the US in 1982, where the act was now simply listed as Stars On. It also reached #14 in the UK, where it was called &quot;Stars Medley&quot; — confusingly, exactly the same title as the third album in the British Isles. In Continental Europe and most other parts of the world, the Stevie Wonder medley was entitled &quot;Stars on Stevie&quot;. In late 1982, Eggermont and Duiser again won the Conamus Export Prize, this time together with Tony Sherman, who sang lead vocals on &quot;Stars on Stevie&quot;.

===Later inspirations===

In 1982, there was a staged musical show at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Hollywood, California and a video of that show was released in 1983 by MCA Home Video.

A spinoff group called The Star Sisters had a hit in Europe in 1983 with an Andrews Sisters medley. The albums were released under the moniker of &quot;Stars on 45 Proudly Presents the Star Sisters&quot;.

1985 saw the release of an album titled &quot;Stars on 45 — Soul Revue&quot; and a single called &quot;The Sam &amp; Dave Medley&quot; credited to &#x27;Stars on 45 featuring Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;, and including the Stars on 45 logo on the album cover, but not produced by Jaap Eggermont. It featured David Prater and his new singing partner Sam Daniels. Original Sam &amp; Dave member Sam Moore demanded that the album and single be recalled; they were later re-labelled and re-issued, but now credited to &#x27;The New Sam &amp; Dave Revue&#x27;.

Later releases included &quot;Stars on Frankie&quot;, released in October 1987; and some eleven years later, &quot;Stars on 45: The Club Hits&quot;, released in 1998; the latter, however, was not produced by Eggermont. While the three original Stars on 45 albums have been reissued on CD in their entirety or in their original form, several CD compilations on European budget labels such as Demon Music Group&#x27;s subsidiary Music Club, Arcade, Edel Records, Falcon Neuen Media, Bunny Music, and ZYX Records have been released under the non-copyrighted &#x27;Stars on 45&#x27; moniker all through the 1990s and 2000s (decade). These include &quot;The Best of Stars on 45&quot;, &quot;The Very Best of Stars of 45&quot;, &quot;The Magic of Stars on 45&quot;, &quot;Stars on 45 Presents the Mighty Megamix Album&quot;, &quot;Greatest Stars on 45&quot;, &quot;The Non-Stop Party Album!&quot;, &quot;Greatest Stars on 45 Vol. 1&quot;, and &quot;Greatest Stars on 45 Vol. 2&quot;. It should, however, be noted that some of these compilations also feature titles such as &quot;Carpenters Medley&quot;, &quot;Beach Boys Gold&quot;, &quot;The Spencer Davis Group Medley&quot;, &quot;Love Songs Are Forever&quot;, and the like—again, recordings that were neither produced by Jaap Eggermont nor originally released as by Stars on 45 in the 1980s. (See below.)

==Similar acts and parodies==

=== Before Stars on 45 ===
In 1976, the Ritchie Family had scored their biggest U.S. hit with a similar medley named &quot;The Best Disco in Town&quot;. This had incorporated various pop hits of the day, such as Silver Convention&#x27;s &quot;Fly, Robin, Fly&quot; and Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot;, recreated in an order, and segued by the title theme.

Four years before the release of the &quot;Stars on 45&quot;, a similar medley named &quot;Rockollection&quot; was produced by the Frenchman Laurent Voulzy. Around the same time, Shalamar debuted with their single &quot;Uptown Festival&quot;, featuring a medley of Motown hits from the 60&#x27;s. Dutch band Veronica Unlimited scored a big hit in 1977 in the Benelux countries and at home with the disco medley &quot;What Kind of Dance Is This&quot;. The band Café Crème played its &quot;Unlimited Citations&quot; (1977) by taking the original Beatles recordings, editing them into a sequence, overdubbing identical drum and bass parts, singing hit songs as faithfully as possible, and stringing them together, with a common tempo and relentless underlying drum track. The single, with its 45-word title, was a hit throughout Europe (including Netherlands) and North Africa. The band acted playback on TV but played the medley live in a different place every night over more than 500 nights (almost two years) in multiple countries.

=== After Stars on 45 (Volume 1)===
The &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; chart of Thursday, 13 August 1981, had seven medleys in the Top 40 (by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Tight Fit, Gidea Park, Lobo, Starsound, Startrax and Enigma) with &quot;Stars on 45 (Volume 2)&quot; and &quot;Startrax Club Disco&quot;, a Bee Gees medley, jointly holding the number 27 slot in the chart.

Beginning in the late 1980s, a British novelty group, Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers, had several hit singles using the same format as Stars on 45, only using primarily big band and 1950s-60s rock and roll songs. Initially, the group utilized remixes of original recordings by artists such as Bill Haley and His Comets, Little Richard and the Everly Brothers, but later used singer-impersonators in similar form to Stars on 45. Among their best known releases were &quot;Swing the Mood&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s What I Like&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Tortuga Rebel, had several hit singles in Latin America using the same model, including mostly Spanish-language rock songs from the 1950s and 1960s. Tortuga Rebel used remixes of recordings by Mexican groups. Albums include &quot;Tortuga Rebel — Todo el Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot;, &quot;Vamos al rock&quot;, and others in Spanish.

The wording &quot;...on 45&quot; has been used by others (often for comedic effect), including &quot;Polkas on 45&quot;, a polka medleys of popular hits by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic; Scars on 45, a British indie rock band; &quot;War on 45&quot;, an EP by hardcore punk band D.O.A.; Star Turn on 45 (Pints), a British comedic novelty band; and &quot;Maoris on 45&quot;, a novelty medley single by New Zealand group the Consorts.

<doc id="380656" wikidata="Q175877" url="?curid=380656" title="William H. Crawford">
<text>William Harris Crawford (February 24, 1772 – September 15, 1834) was an American politician who served as U.S. Secretary of War and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. He later ran for U.S. president in the 1824 election.

Born in Virginia, Crawford moved to Georgia with his parents at a young age, and he grew up to become one of the state’s most popular politicians. After studying law, Crawford won election to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1803. He aligned with the Democratic-Republican Party and U.S. Senator James Jackson. In 1807, the Georgia legislature elected Crawford to the U.S. Senate. After the death of Vice President George Clinton, Crawford&#x27;s position as president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate made him first in the presidential line of succession from April 1812 to March 1813. In 1813, U.S. President James Madison appointed Crawford as the minister to France, and Crawford held that post for the remainder of the War of 1812. After the war, Madison appointed him to the position of Secretary of War. In October 1816, Madison chose Crawford for the position of Secretary of the Treasury, and Crawford would remain in that office for the remainder of Madison&#x27;s presidency and for the duration of James Monroe&#x27;s presidency.

Although Crawford suffered a severe stroke in 1823, he sought to succeed Monroe at the 1824 election. Because of his roots in Virginia, Crawford received the support of the Virginia dynasty, but ongoing concerns about his health along with a changing political landscape made it impossible for him to become the fourth consecutive Virginia native to hold the office of president. The Democratic-Republican Party splintered into factions, as several others also sought the presidency. No candidate won a majority of the electoral vote and so the U.S. House of Representatives chose the president in a contingent election. Under the terms of the U.S. Constitution, the House selected from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, which left Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and Crawford in the running. The House selected Adams, who asked Crawford to remain as Treasury Secretary. Declining Adams&#x27;s offer, Crawford returned to Georgia and accepted an appointment to the state superior court.

Crawford considered running in the 1832 presidential election for the presidency or the vice presidency but ultimately chose not to when fellow southerner Andrew Jackson sought a second term.

==Early life==
Crawford was born on February 24, 1772, in the portion of Amherst County, Virginia, that later became Nelson County, the son of Joel Crawford and Fanny Harris, but at least one source has given his birthplace as Tusculum, a house whose site remains in Amherst County. He moved with his family to Edgefield County, South Carolina, in 1779 and to Columbia County, Georgia, in 1783. Crawford was educated at private schools in Georgia and at Richmond Academy in Augusta. After his father&#x27;s death, Crawford became the family&#x27;s main financial provider, and he worked on the Crawford family farm and taught school. He later studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1799 and began to practice in Lexington. Also in 1799, Crawford was appointed by the state legislature to prepare a digest of Georgia&#x27;s statutes.

==State politics==
He influenced Georgia politics for decades. In 1803, Crawford was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he served until 1807. He allied himself with Senator James Jackson. Their enemies were the Clarkites, led by John Clark. In 1802, he shot and killed Peter Lawrence Van Alen, a Clark ally, in a duel. Four years later, on December 16, 1806, Crawford faced Clark himself in a duel, and Crawford&#x27;s left wrist was shattered by a shot from Clark, but he eventually recovered.

==U.S. Senate==
In 1807, Crawford joined the 10th Congress as the junior U.S. senator from Georgia when the Georgia legislature elected him to replace George Jones, who had held the office for a few months after the death of Abraham Baldwin.

Crawford was elected President pro tempore of the Senate in March 1812 and, following the April 20, 1812, death of Vice President George Clinton, served as the permanent Presiding Officer of the Senate until March 4, 1813.

In 1811, Crawford declined to serve as Secretary of War in the Madison administration. In the Senate, he voted for several acts leading up to the War of 1812 and supported the entry into the war, but he was ready for peace: &quot;Let it then be the wisdom of this nation to remain at peace, as long as peace is within its option.&quot;

Throughout his service in the Senate, Crawford was described as a member of the older more traditional wing of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he often focused on issues such as states&#x27; rights, which he supported.

==Minister to France==
In 1813, President James Madison appointed Crawford as the U.S. minister to France during the waning years of Napoleon&#x27;s First French Empire. Crawford served until 1815, shortly after the end of the Napoleonic Wars.

==Cabinet==
Upon Crawford&#x27;s return, Madison appointed him as Secretary of War on 1 August 1815. Crawford served more than a year in that post. He sought but narrowly failed to win the Democratic-Republican nomination for the 1816 presidential race. Madison appointed him Treasury Secretary on 22 October 1816. He remained in that post for the rest of Madison&#x27;s term and both terms of President James Monroe, until 6 March 1825. While Treasury Secretary he initiated the Reform Bill of 1817.

==1824 election==
The Congressional Caucus nominated Crawford for the 1824 election. However, Crawford had suffered a stroke in 1823 as a result of a lobelia prescription given to him by his physician. The Democratic-Republican Party was now split, and one of the splinter groups nominated Crawford. Despite improved health and the support of former Presidents Madison and Thomas Jefferson, he finished third in the electoral vote, behind Senator and General Andrew Jackson, hero of the Battle of New Orleans, and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. In the subsequent contingent election, the House elected Adams President.

==Later life==
Refusing Adams&#x27;s request for him to remain at the Treasury, Crawford then returned to Georgia, where he was appointed as a state superior court judge. Crawford remained an active judge until his death, a decade later.

Crawford was nominated for vice president by the Georgia legislature in 1828 but withdrew after support from other states was not forthcoming. Crawford also considered running for vice president in 1832 but decided against it, in favor of Martin Van Buren. Crawford also considered running for president again in 1832 but dropped the idea when Jackson decided to seek a second term.

Crawford is buried at the site of his home, about half a mile west of the current Crawford city limit.

==Societies==
During the 1820s, Crawford was a member of the prestigious society Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which had among its members former Presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams.

Crawford also served as a Vice President in the American Colonization Society from its formation in 1817 to his death.

==Family==
Crawford was a descendant of John Crawford (1600–1676), who had come to Virginia in 1643, but participated and died in Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion. John&#x27;s son David Crawford I (1625–1698), was the father of David Crawford II (1662–1762), and the grandfather of David Crawford III (1697–1766). David Crawford III married Ann Anderson in 1727 and had 13 children, including Joel Crawford (1736–1788).

His cousin, George W. Crawford, served as Secretary of War under President Zachary Taylor.

==Legacy==

In 1875, Crawford appeared on the 50 cents bill.

<text>James Gillespie Birney (February 4, 1792 – November 18, 1857) was an American abolitionist, politician, and attorney born in Danville, Kentucky. He changed from being a planter and slave owner to abolitionism, publishing the abolitionist weekly &quot;The Philanthropist&quot;. He twice served as the presidential nominee for the anti-slavery Liberty Party.

Birney pursued a legal career in Danville after graduating from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton) and studying under Alexander J. Dallas. He volunteered for the campaigns of Henry Clay, served on the town council, and became a Freemason. In 1816, he won election to the Kentucky House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. In 1818, he established a cotton plantation in Madison County, Alabama, and he won election to the Alabama House of Representatives the following year. Birney eventually sold the plantation and established a legal practice in Huntsville, Alabama, becoming one of the most successful lawyers in the region.

During the 1820s, Birney became increasingly troubled by the issue of slavery. He became a member of the American Colonization Society, which advocated for the migration of African Americans to the continent of Africa. After serving in various roles for the organization, Birney began calling for the immediate abolition of slavery. In 1835, he moved to Cincinnati, founding &quot;The Philanthropist&quot; the following year. He also became a member of the American Anti-Slavery Society, but resigned from that group due to his opposition to connecting the anti-slavery struggle to the movement for equal rights for women, although Birney endorsed the cause of women&#x27;s suffrage. Birney accepted the Liberty Party&#x27;s nomination in 1840 and received 0.3% of the popular vote. He accepted the Liberty Party nomination again in 1844 and received 2.3% of the popular vote, finishing behind James K. Polk and Clay. Birney moved to Michigan in 1841 and helped establish the town of Bay City, Michigan.

==Youth==

Born to an affluent Irish Episcopalian slaveholder of the same name in Danville, Kentucky, James G. Birney lost his mother, Martha Reed, when he was three. He and his sister were raised by their widowed aunt, who had come over from Ireland at the request of his father to look after the two. He was influenced by his aunt&#x27;s opposition to slavery; she refused to own slaves. By 1795, his father&#x27;s two sisters and their families had migrated from Ireland, settling on farms near his home. Most of his mother&#x27;s relatives had also migrated nearby, settling in other areas of Mercer County, Kentucky. Growing up, he saw the issue of slavery from a variety of perspectives. Though his father fought to prevent their state of Kentucky from joining the Union as a slave state, when the effort failed, he decided that until the legislature abolished slavery from the state as a whole, a person could own slaves as long as he treated them humanely. Other members of Birney&#x27;s family felt a personal moral responsibility and refused to own slaves. For his own part, Birney agreed with his father and received his first slave, Michael, a boy his own age, at age six. However, for much of his youth and education, he was under the influence of teachers and friends with strong anti-slavery views. For example, he attended several sermons given by a Baptist abolitionist by the name of David Barrow in his youth, which he later recalled with fondness.

==Schooling==

When Birney turned eleven he was sent to Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, where &quot;one of Birney’s teachers, Robert Hamilton Bishop, was one of the state&#x27;s earliest outspoken opponents of slavery.&quot; He returned home two years later to enter a school run by a Presbyterian man that had just opened in Danville, where he excelled in his studies, mostly based in the sciences. In 1808, at age sixteen, he entered the College of New Jersey (later, Princeton University). He studied political philosophy, logic, and moral philosophy, and became known as a proficient debater. Among his classmates, he became particularly good friends with George M. Dallas. He studied under the president of the school (Samuel Stanhope Smith), both a logician and an author who was somewhat anti-slavery. He was also exposed to the anti-slavery thinking of John McLean. Birney graduated from Princeton on September 26, 1810.

When he returned to Danville following graduation, he worked for the campaign of Henry Clay for one month. After this, he began to study law in Philadelphia, at the office of Alexander J. Dallas, the father of his Princeton friend and classmate. Enjoying considerable financial means, he had a horse carriage for transportation and was always well-dressed. He also made friends with members of the local Quaker community. He remained in Philadelphia with Dallas for the next three years, until he passed the Philadelphia bar examination and was admitted to the bar association, giving him the right to practice law.

==Law practice==
In May 1814 Birney returned to his hometown and took up the practice of law there, becoming the acting attorney for the local bank. He handled both civil and criminal lawsuits in Danville and other outlying cities of Kentucky. The economy of Kentucky was rather poor at this time, as the War of 1812 had caused a schism in trade within the state. Having trouble making ends meet, Birney made his living at this time primarily as a claims adjuster.

Following in the footsteps of his father, Birney became a Freemason upon his return to Danville and a member of Danville&#x27;s town council, making him a member of the town&#x27;s social elite. He also fell in love with Agatha McDowell and married her on February 1, 1816, at a Presbyterian church; they had 11 children, of whom 6 survived to adulthood. Among the wedding gifts the young couple received were slaves from his father and father-in-law. As Birney had yet to fully develop his abolitionist views, he accepted them kindly. It should be said that later in life Birney was known to say on many occasions that he does not recall ever believing that slavery was right.

==Kentucky politics==

In 1815, he again worked for the successful campaign of Henry Clay, who was running for U.S. Congress. He also campaigned for George Madison, who was running for Kentucky governor and won (Madison died months later). George Madison was also the maternal uncle of his wife, Agatha McDowell. His political sentiments at the time were with the Democratic-Republican Party. In 1816, Birney won a seat in the Kentucky Legislature representing Mercer County, becoming a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives at age twenty-four. In 1817, the Kentucky Senate drafted a resolution that proposed opening a dialogue between the newly installed governor of Kentucky, Gabriel Slaughter, and the governors of Ohio and Indiana for the purpose of passing laws in those states calling for the capture and return of runaway slaves from Kentucky.

Birney staunchly opposed this resolution and it was defeated, though a new resolution was soon after drafted and passed, despite Birney&#x27;s opposition yet again. As he saw very little future for himself in Kentucky politics, Birney decided to move to Alabama with the hope of starting a political career.

==Alabama==
In February 1818, he moved his family to Madison County, Alabama, where he purchased a cotton plantation and slaves, most of whom came with him from Kentucky. In 1819, Birney became a member of the Alabama House of Representatives representing Madison County. While there, he helped draft an act that would afford slaves tried by jury paid legal counsel, barring the master and prosecutorial witness or their relatives from being members of the jury. This, along with his opposition to the nomination of Andrew Jackson for U.S. president, hampered many of his future political ambitions in Alabama. He opposed Jackson primarily on the grounds that he was foul-tempered, having executed two men personally.

In 1823, after experiencing many troubles with his cotton plantation, Birney moved to Huntsville, Alabama, to practice law again. His financial troubles were due in part to his habit of horse race gambling, which he gave up eventually after many losses. Most of his slaves stayed on at the plantation, though he did bring with him to Huntsville his servant Michael, as well as Michael&#x27;s wife and three children.

At this time there were a number of other practicing lawyers in that area, including one John McKinley. His name preceded him, and he was admitted to the Alabama bar association. McKinley, along with several other prominent members of society, successfully campaigned for Birney to become the solicitor of Alabama&#x27;s Fifth District in 1823. By the end of the year he decided to close his plantation, and sold the slaves at the plantation to a friend of his that was known for his good temperament and kind treatment of slaves. Following the sale of the plantation and slaves, he achieved financial stability, bought a generous plot of land and constructed a large brick house in Huntsville. As was true upon his first return to Danville years back, he once again became a member of the social elite in this new town. In addition to his duties as a public prosecutor, his private law office proved quite lucrative.

By 1825, he was the wealthiest lawyer in northern Alabama, partnering up with Arthur F. Hopkins. The next year, he resigned as solicitor general to pursue his own career with more tenacity. Over the next several years, he worked, often defending blacks, was appointed a trustee of a private school and joined the Presbyterian Church. In 1828, he became an elector on the John Quincy Adams and Richard Rush ticket. He strongly supported Adams for his conservatism, viewing the politics of Andrew Jackson and John C. Calhoun as a threat to the Union. To Birney&#x27;s great disappointment, Jackson won. However, he found other ways to champion his beliefs. In 1829, his fellow citizens elected him mayor of Huntsville, Alabama, where he distinguished himself as a reformist, campaigning for free public education and temperance.

===American Colonization Society===
Birney&#x27;s religious fervor also encouraged him to reevaluate his views on slavery. Increasingly alienated by the politics of the Jackson administration, he discovered the American Colonization Society in 1826. In 1829, he was introduced to Josiah Polk of the ACS by Henry Clay and became an early supporter of the society. He was intrigued by the possibility of solving the supposed problem constituted by free blacks by starting a colony for them in Liberia, Africa. In January 1830 he helped begin a chapter in Huntsville, Alabama, and subscribed to its literature.

He was then sent on a trip to the East Coast for the University of Alabama in search of professors for the college, following the receipt of a generous endowment for the school. From August through October 1830 he visited Philadelphia, New Brunswick, New York, New Haven, Boston, Ohio, and Kentucky. He returned home with numerous recommendations, and was thanked for his services. While in these areas, with the exception of Kentucky, he was greatly encouraged by the presence of free states in the Union. This same year, he had some sort of falling out with Henry Clay and also ceased further campaigning for the Democratic-Republican Party.

In 1831, Birney began considering moving to Illinois, as he was troubled with the idea of his children growing up in a slave state. He mentioned a move to Illinois frequently, stating he would free his remaining slave Michael, Michael&#x27;s wife, and three children there. However, this never came to pass. In 1832, the American Colonization Society offered him a position as an agent to travel around the South promoting their cause and he accepted. He met with some success, including organizing the departure of settlers to Liberia and writing essays in defense of colonization. However, in failing to convert his audience to colonization, he began to doubt its effectiveness and the acceptability of slavery. By 1832, he had decided to return to Danville, Kentucky.

==Gradual emancipation==
A year before returning to Danville, Birney wrote letters to slaveholders in Kentucky who had previously expressed their support for emancipation, suggesting they soon hold a convention on the matter. On December 6, 1832, the gathering was held, with only nine slave owners in attendance. Most of these pledged not to emancipate their current slaves, but to emancipate their slave&#x27;s offspring at age twenty-one. This small group also aimed to bring in non-slaveholders to promote this idea of &quot;gradual emancipation&quot;.

==Abolitionist==

Birney&#x27;s repudiation of the American Colonization Society and its projects was enormously influential; Gerrit Smith called it &quot;celebrated&quot;.
He was the society&#x27;s employee, one of its agents. &quot;No man has a better knowledge of colonization and its practical effects at the South.&quot;

In 1833, he read a paper signed by several Christian organizations that repudiated the tenets of the American Colonization Society and, instead, called for the immediate abolition of slavery. Almost the entirety of the following number of the society&#x27;s magazine, &quot;African Repository&quot;, was devoted to an answer or &quot;review&quot; of him. This, along with life experience and education, brought Birney to the realization that slavery must be abolished once and for all. Inspired by correspondence and discussions with Theodore Weld, the organizer of the Lane Seminary debates, he freed his remaining slaves and declared himself an abolitionist in 1834.

===Abolitionist newspaper===

Birney decided to make Cincinnati his base, and made contacts with friends and fellow members of the abolitionist movement there. He worked to gain support in publishing an anti-slavery newspaper. At this time, there were four newspapers in the city, and all but the &quot;Cincinnati Daily Gazette&quot; released &quot;roundabout&quot; editorials the next day that assailed the faults of abolitionism in general. One paper, &quot;The Daily Post&quot; (not to be confused with the Cincinnati Post), even called for lynching those who set out to author anti-slavery literature in their city.

The &quot;Gazette,&quot; which was owned by editor Charles Hammond, came to be an ally of sorts to Birney and his paper. While Hammond himself did not support equal rights for negroes, he did support the idea of a free press and freedom of speech. He also strongly resented the attempts of the South to legalize slaveholding in the North.

Birney&#x27;s original plan was to publish his abolitionist newspaper in Danville. In August 1835, a meeting of &quot;4 or 500 persons, has met at Danville, K., to warn James G. Birney against publication of his Abolition paper. A Committee of 5 was selected to wait on [meet with] Birney, and serve him with a copy of their Resolutions. He must be a daft man to persevere! It will be at his own peril. He will rue the consequences, as sure as he persists.&quot; In September we find that he &quot;has abandoned the project of publishing an Abolition paper in Danville, Ky., and has removed to Cincinnati. A very good idea.&quot;
When Birney began publication of his abolitionist weekly, &quot;The Philanthropist&quot;, in Cincinnati, he and the paper were from the first the subject of controversy, with the majority of local newspapers and others doing everything they could to make him feel unwelcome. The Louisville Journal wrote a scathing editorial that all but directly threatened his paper. (quoted at left).

On July 14, 1836, a mob destroyed Birney&#x27;s press. On July 30 the press was attacked again; the printing press was broken into pieces and the largest piece dragged through the streets and dumped in the river. The mob attempted to tar and feather Birney but could not find him. They went on to destroy houses of Blacks; the whole constitutes the Cincinnati riots of 1836.

However, writing for his newspaper helped him develop ideas for fighting slavery legislatively. He used them as he worked with Salmon P. Chase to protect slaves who escaped to Ohio. In 1837, he was fined $50 () for harboring a slave. That same year, the American Anti-Slavery Society recruited him as an officer and corresponding secretary, and he moved his family to New York.

===Liberty Party===

With the American Anti-Slavery Society&#x27;s schism in 1840, he resigned his position over disagreements on the role of women&#x27;s rights to the anti-slavery campaign. Also in that year, the Liberty Party, a newly formed political party whose only aim was abolition, nominated Birney for president. Accurately predicting he would not win, he instead went as a delegate to the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. The convention named him a vice-president and spread his writings throughout the United Kingdom. When he came back, the Liberty Party made use of his legal expertise in their efforts to defend blacks and fugitive slaves. They chose him as their candidate again in the 1844 presidential election with a campaign designed to draw votes away from the Whig Party candidate Henry Clay. In the New York election, Birney achieved 15,812 votes after Clay lost to the Democrat James K. Polk by only 5,106 votes; if Clay had won this state he would have achieved a majority in the Electoral College and won the election.

==Michigan==
In 1841, Birney moved to Saginaw, Michigan, with his new wife and family. He lived at the Webster House in Saginaw for a few months until his home in Bay City, Michigan, was ready. Birney was in the land development business in Bay City. He was a trustee of the reorganized Saginaw Bay Company and was deeply involved in the planning of Bay City, Michigan, where Birney Park is named after him. Birney and the other developers supported churches in their community and set aside money for their construction. In addition to running for the presidency in 1840 and 1844, Birney received 3023 votes for Governor of Michigan in 1845. Birney remained in Michigan until 1855, when his health drove him to move to the East Coast.

While in Bay City, Birney led a life of farming and agricultural pursuits in addition to his legal work, land development, and national anti-slavery involvement. He commented on the lack of help available in the city and was found working on his own fence.

His son, James Birney, came to Bay City, then called Lower Saginaw, to take care of his father&#x27;s business interests in the city. James remained in Bay City and followed his father&#x27;s tradition of public service. He is buried in Pine Ridge Cemetery on the East side of town.

==Paralysis==
In August 1845, Birney suffered from bouts of paralysis following a horseback riding accident, which recurred intermittently for the remainder of his life. His speech became affected as his condition worsened, until he was eventually left to communication through gestures and writing (the latter made difficult by severe tremors). He ended his public career and his direct involvement in the abolitionist movement as a result, though he kept himself informed of new developments and campaigned for causes including the abolition of the military during the Mexican-American War and a decrease in immigration, arguing that European immigrants diluted the influence of America&#x27;s free people of color.

He died in New Jersey in 1857 in the Raritan Bay Union, a communal settlement, surrounded by abolitionist friends Theodore Weld, his wife Angelina Grimké Weld, and her sister Sarah Grimké, convinced that war would be necessary to end slavery. He was buried at the Williamsburg Cemetery in Groveland, New York, the home of his second wife&#x27;s family.

==Honors==

In 1889, an all-black school in the Hillsdale neighborhood of Washington, D.C., was named the Birney School in his honor. It later became an elementary school and in 1962 it was renamed Nichols Avenue Elementary School.

==Family==
Birney married Agatha McDowell in 1816. Agatha was the daughter of U.S. district judge for Kentucky William McDowell and Margaret Madison, a distant relative of James Madison. James and Agatha&#x27;s marriage produced eleven children, only six of whom survived early childhood: James, William, Dion, David Bell, George, and Florence. Agatha died in October 1838.

On 25 March 1841, Birney married Elizabeth Potts Fitzhugh (sister of Henry Fitzhugh and of Ann Carroll Fitzhugh, wife of Gerrit Smith). Their two children were Ann Hughes Birney (1844–1846) and Fitzhugh Birney (1842–1864).

Birney&#x27;s oldest son James served as the 13th Lieutenant Governor of Michigan under Governor Austin Blair and as the U.S. Minister to the Netherlands.

Four of Birney&#x27;s sons fought in the American Civil War. David was a Union Army major-general who died of disease in October 1864. William was a U.S. inspector-general of U.S. Colored Troops who later became a U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Dion was a U.S. lieutenant who died during the Peninsula campaign in 1862. Fitzhugh was a U.S. major at the time of his death by pneumonia in June 1864.

<text>Ekron (Philistine: 𐤏𐤒𐤓𐤍 &quot;*ʿAqārān&quot;, , ), in the Hellenistic period known as Accaron () was at first a Canaanite, and later more famously a Philistine city, one of the five cities of the Philistine Pentapolis, located in present-day Israel.

In 1957, Ekron was first identified with the mound of Khirbet el-Muqanna (Arabic) or Tel Miqne (Hebrew), near the depopulated Palestinian village of &#x27;Aqir, on the basis of the large size of the Iron Age archaeological remains; the judgement was strengthened by the discovery in 1996 of the Ekron inscription. The tell lies west of Jerusalem, and north of Tel es-Safi, the almost certain site of the Philistine city of Gath, on the grounds of Kibbutz Revadim on the eastern edge of the Israeli coastal plain. The other main cities of the Philistine Pentapolis beyond Ekron and Gath were Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ashdod.

== In the Bible ==
In the Hebrew Bible, Ekron is mentioned initially in :
:&quot;This is the land that still remains: all the regions of the Philistines and all those of the Geshurites from Shihor, which is east of Egypt, northward to the boundary of Ekron.&quot;

 counts it the border city of the Philistines and seat of one of the five Philistine city lords, and mentions Ekron&#x27;s satellite towns and villages. The city was reassigned afterwards to the tribe of Dan (), but came again into the full possession of the Philistines. It was the last place to which the Philistines carried the Ark of the Covenant before they sent it back to Israel ( and ), and the city lords returned here once they had seen that the Ark reached the Israelites in Beth Shemesh ().

There was a noted sanctuary of Baal at Ekron. The Baal who was worshipped was called Baal Zebub, which some scholars connect with &quot;Beelzebub&quot;, known from :
:&quot;[King] Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber at Samaria and was injured. So he sent messengers whom he instructed: &quot;Go inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this injury.&quot;&quot; (JPS translation)
The prophet Elijah repeatedly condemned Ahaziah for turning to Baal-zebub for assurance:
:&quot;Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&quot;

Ekron&#x27;s destruction is prophesied in :
:&quot;Ekron shall be rooted up.&quot;

==Location==
Jerome wrote that Ekron was to the east of Azotus and Iamnia (consistent with the modern interpretation), however he also mentioned that some equated the city with Straton&#x27;s Tower at Caesarea Maritima. This may be a reference to Rabbi Abbahu&#x27;s identification of Ekron with Caesarea in Megillah.

Robinson first identified the Arab village of Aqir as the site of Ekron in 1838, and this was accepted until it was contested by Macalister in 1913, who suggested Khirbet Dikerin, and Albright in 1922, who suggested Qatra.

The identification of Ekron as Tel Miqneh was suggested by Naveh and Kallai in 1957–1958, a theory now widely accepted in light of the Ekron Royal Dedicatory Inscription found during the 1996 excavations.

==History==
The site of Tel Miqne was lightly occupied beginning in the Chalcolithic period and up to the Early Bronze Age.

===Middle Bronze IIB===
After a 400-year gap when only the upper tel was occupied, the city underwent a major expansion &quot;c.&quot;1600 BCE, under the Canaanites.

In Stratum XI (MB IIB) both the Upper City and Lower City was occupied. Later, the occupation would retreat to the Upper City.

===Late Bronze===
The Canaanite city had shrunk in the years before its main public building burned in the 13th century BCE, during the Bronze Age collapse, a period of general devastation associated with the Sea Peoples.

===Iron Age===
====Iron Age I====
It was re-established by Philistines at the beginning of the Iron Age, &quot;c.&quot;12th century BCE. During the Iron Age, Ekron was a border city on the frontier contested between Philistia and the kingdom of Judah.

====Iron Age IIC====
Records of the Neo-Assyrian Empire also refer to Ekron, as &quot;Amqarrūna&quot;. The siege of Ekron in 712 BCE is depicted on one of Sargon II&#x27;s wall reliefs in his palace at Khorsabad, which names the city. Ekron revolted against Sennacherib and expelled Padi, his governor, who was sent to Hezekiah, King of Judah, for safe-keeping in Jerusalem. Sennacherib marched against Ekron and the Ekronites called upon the aid of the king of Mutsri from northwest Arabia. Sennacherib turned aside to defeat this army, which he did at Eltekeh, and then returned and took the city by storm, put to death the leaders of the revolt and carried their adherents into captivity. This campaign led to the famous attack of Sennacherib on Hezekiah and Jerusalem, in which Sennacherib compelled Hezekiah to restore Padi, who was reinstated as governor at Ekron. The Philistine city of Ekron is specifically named in the Aramaic stele (Oriental Institute Prism) detailing Sennacherib&#x27;s exploits in the land of Judah:
The cities of his (i.e. Hezekiah&#x27;s), which I had despoiled, I cut off from his land and to Mitinti, king of Ashdod, [and to] Padi, king of Ekron, [and to] Silli-bel, king of Gaza, I gave. And (thus) I diminished his land.

Ashdod and Ekron survived to become powerful city-states dominated by the Assyrians in the 7th century BCE. The city was later destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II in 604 BCE, and although it is mentioned, as &quot;Accaron&quot;, as late as 1 Maccabees 10:89 (2nd century BCE), it was never resettled on a large scale.

An olive oil production center dating from the seventh century BCE discovered at Ekron has over one hundred large olive oil presses, and is the most complete olive oil production center from ancient times to be discovered. The discovery indicates that olive oil production was highly developed in the Levant and that it was a major producer of olive oil for its residents as well as for other parts of the Ancient Near East, such as Egypt and especially Mesopotamia.

==Archaeology==

The Tel Miqne excavations were conducted for 14 seasons between 1981 and 1996, sponsored by the Albright Institute of Archaeological Research and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, under the direction of Trude Dothan and Seymour Gitin. The primary research focus was an interdisciplinary investigation of the interactions between the Philistines, Israelites, Phoenicians, Assyrians, and Egyptians during the Late Bronze Age II, Iron Age I and II.

===Chronological development===
The ceramic evidence indicates a presence at the site in the Chalcolithic period and Early Bronze Age. A continuous stratigraphic profile, however, was found only in the upper city on the Northeast Acropolis (Field I), beginning in Stratum XI of the MB IIB and extending through the end of Stratum I of the Iron IIC. In the lower city (Fields II, III, IV, V, X), a 400-year occupational gap followed
Stratum XI of the 17th–first half of the 16th century BCE until its resettlement in Stratum VII at the beginning of the Iron I, ca. 1175 BCE. Another occupational gap of ca. 270 years followed the end of Iron I Stratum IV, ca. 975 BCE, in the lower city (Fields II, III, IV, V, X), until it was again resettled in Stratum I of the 7th century BCE. The cities at Ekron were well planned in both the Iron I and Iron II, with four distinct zones of occupation: fortifications, industrial, domestic, and elite. The final Iron II occupation in the 7th/6th centuries BCE was represented by a single architectural unit in Field III in the lower city. A presence in the Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic periods was attested in Fields IV Upper and V.

===Chronological chart===
====Middle Bronze Age====
The tel was apparently shaped by fortifications that encompassed both the upper and lower cities in the Middle Bronze Age. Monumental platforms, part of the fortification ramparts, were excavated in Fields III and X. MB II ceramic evidence was found throughout the tel, as were fragmentary architectural remains and three infant jar burials excavated in Field IV Lower.

====Late Bronze Age====
The unfortified Strata X–VIII settlement was found only in the upper city in Field I on the Northeast Acropolis. It yielded Cypriot and Mycenaean imported pottery and Anatolian Grey burnished ware, attesting to international maritime trade. Egyptian influences are also evident, inter alia, in the burial containing a 19th Dynasty seal and scarab and in the 14th century BCE scarab bearing the name of the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III and dedicated to the &quot;Lady of the Sycamore Tree,&quot; usually associated with the foundations of Egyptian shrines, an heirloom found in a later Iron I phase. The last Canaanite city of Stratum VIII was destroyed in a violent conflagration, dramatically illustrated on the Summit by a severely-burnt storeroom complex that yielded jars containing carbonized grains, lentils, and figs.

====Iron Age I====
Stratum VII is characterized by a new material culture with Aegean and Cypriot affinities introduced by the Philistines, one of the Sea Peoples featuring the locally-made Philistine 1 (previously designated Mycenaean IIIC:1) pottery. Such pottery is known as Cypriot Bichrome ware, and Philistine Bichrome ware.

In the Strata VI–V Philistine 2 (Bichrome) pottery with red and black decoration on white slip is a major part of the ceramic assemblage. The material culture of Stratum IV is characterized by Philistine 3 (debased) pottery and the influence of a ceramic tradition of predominantly red-slipped and burnished ware.

In the upper city features in Stratum VII, include a mudbrick city wall, megaron-type buildings, hearths, a limestone bathtub, and an industrial kiln area. In Strata VI–V, a major feature was the mudbrick glacis, a cultic room with an incised scapula similar to those found in the 12th and 11th century BCE shrines at Enkomi and Kition on Cyprus.

In the lower city, along the ridge of the southern slope of the tel, behind the Iron I mudbrick city wall of Stratum VI, were a number of architectural units and finds, which included a bull-shaped zoomorphic vessel, an incised ivory tube, and a bronze pin and needle. Stratum V monumental building was constructed on a similar scale as the one in the elite zone. The artifacts, many representing a continuation of Aegean traditions, include a rectangular bone plaque painted in blue and incised with the depiction of the rear of a horse, a Mycenaean-type female figurine, a gold spiral hair-ring, a conical stamp seal depicting two prancing gazelles, an iron knife with an ivory handle, two small pebbled hearths, and two goat skulls.

The domestic buildings continued in use in Stratum IV with no substantial change, and special finds included an incised scapula, similar to those found in the upper city.

Also in the lower city, in the elite zone, Stratum VII was represented by a number of installations, including rectangular hearths. In Stratum VI circular hearths were found in a large public structure, which also produced a round ivory pyxis lid decorated with scenes of animals in battle. In Stratum V, a megaron-type building contained superimposed pebbled hearths, three rooms with benches and bamot, and a monumental entrance hall with two mushroom-shaped stone pillar bases.

One room yielded 20 spherical loom weights in the Aegean tradition. This building also produced three miniature bronze wheels from a cultic stand of a type known from Cyprus and reminiscent of the biblical description of the mechonot (laver stands) and a bronze Janus-faced linchpin from a chariot wheel. Another special find was an iron knife with a pierced spool-shaped ivory handle attached with three bronze nails. In Strata VI and V, the building complex contained a large stone bath, a monolith, two stone pillar bases, and several hearths. In Stratum IV the plan of the building complex was reused and its cultic function continued, as attested by the finds, including a cache of ivory, faience, and stone objects, among them decorated earplugs and a ring depicting the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet. The destruction and abandonment of the Stratum IV lower city during the first quarter of the 10th century marked the end of both the early Philistine city and of the Iron I in general at Ekron.

====Iron Age II====
Following the destruction of the Iron I Stratum IV city during the first quarter of the 10th century, the lower city was abandoned. Only the upper city was occupied in Strata III–II fortified with a mudbrick city wall and a 7 m wide mudbrick tower faced with Phoenician –type ashlar masonry in header-and-stretcher construction. Stratum III was continued in the monumental architecture of Stratum IIA–B, with the addition of a series of rooms, probably shops or market stalls, that opened onto the re-paved street, to which a stone-lined central drainage system was added in Stratum IIB.

Both the lower city and the upper city were reoccupied. In the lower city, new fortifications included a city wall and a three-entryway gate protected by a gatehouse, similar to those excavated at Timnah (Tel Batash), Gezer, Lachish, and Ashdod. To the east of the gate, an 80 m long row of stables or storehouses associated with a large public building was built between the city wall and an outer screening wall. The outstanding feature was the olive oil industrial zone, laid out in a belt extending throughout the lower city along the inner face of the city wall. Special finds include a cache of seven well-preserved large iron agricultural tools and nine four-horned limestone altars.

The 115 oil presses found at Ekron have a production capacity of 500–1,000 tons, making it the largest ancient industrial center for the production of olive oil thus far excavated. In Stratum IB of the last third of the 7th century, the diminution in olive oil production is associated with the end of Assyrian domination in Stratum IC and the expansion of the Egyptian sphere of influence to Philistia ca. 630 BCE. Master suggests the answer is to be found in the rediscovery of an old trade route and the entrance of a new player in the olive oil and wine market, the Ionians. The southern trunk route that connected Egypt by sea to the West lay in disuse for five hundred years, while the northern trunk route functioned as the only major route. Ships that made use of the northern route passed by Ashkelon on their journey to and from Egypt, which of course placed Philistia in an advantageous position viz-a-viz trade with Egypt. However, sometime during the latter part of the 7th century the southern route was rediscovered and the Ionians re-established direct trade connections with Egypt. They soon started to undercut the Philistine oil and wine trade. Lower trade volumes meant lower profit margins and so we see some olive oil presses being decommissioned in the latter part of the 7th century. Ashkelon and Ekron’s full productive capacities were no longer needed.

In the elite zone of the lower city, in Stratum I, the Ekron Royal Dedicatory Inscription, one of the most important finds of the 20th century in Israel, was found in the holy of holies, or cella, a room in the sanctuary of the Temple Complex 650. The inscription mentions Ekron, thus confirming the identification of the site, as well as five of its rulers, including Ikausu (Achish), son of Padi, who built the sanctuary.

The sanctuary reflects a Phoenician design, paralleled in Astarte Temple 1 at Kition on Cyprus. The Ekron Royal Dedicatory Inscription incised on a rectangular-shaped limestone block has five-lines and mentions Ekron, thus confirming the identification of the site, as well as five of its rulers, including Ikausu (Achish), son of Padi, who built the sanctuary to Ptgyh, his lady. Padi and Ikausu are known as kings of Ekron from the 7th century Neo-Assyrian Royal Annals. The language and form of writing of the Ekron inscription show a significant Phoenician influence, and the name Ikausu is understood as &quot;the Achaean&quot; or &quot;the Greek&quot; and Ptgyh has been interpreted as a Greek goddess.

Other special finds come from the side-rooms of the sanctuary, which yielded a treasure trove of gold, silver, and bronze objects, including a gold cobra (a uraeus), and a unique assemblage of ivories with cultic connotations. The ivories include a depiction of a woman, perhaps a royal personage; a knob bearing the cartouche of the 12th century Pharaoh Ramses VIII; a large head, probably from the top of a harp; and a large object with a male figure on the front, the image of a royal female personage on the side, and a cartouche of the 13th century Pharaoh Merneptah on the back.

The buildings of the elite zone also produced 16 short inscriptions including kdš l’šrt (&quot;dedicated to [the goddess] Asherat&quot;), lmqm (&quot;for the shrine&quot;), and the letter tet with three horizontal lines below it (probably indicating 30 units of produce set aside for tithing), and silver hoards.

The entire Iron II city was destroyed in a violent conflagration during the 604 BCE campaign of the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II, after which the site was only partially and briefly resettled in the first quarter of the 6th century. A well-preserved Assyrian courtyard-type building was the only remaining architectural evidence for Stratum IA. Thereafter, Ekron was abandoned until the Roman period.

====Roman to Islamic periods====
Ekron next appears in the documentary record in 147 BCE, during the Hellenistic period when the region was under Seleucid rule. At that point Alexander Balas, the ruler of the Seleucid Empire, gave Ekron to Jonathan Apphus. Ekron is also mentioned in Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Onomasticon&quot;, a 4th-century gazetteer, in which it was described as a village. There is but fragmentary evidence from the Roman, Byzantine and Islamic periods found only in Fields IV Upper and V.

<text>The president of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Algeria (, ) is the head of state and chief executive of Algeria, as well as the commander-in-chief of the Algerian People&#x27;s National Armed Forces.

The current president is Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who succeeded Abdelaziz Bouteflika on 19 December 2019.

==History of the office==

The Tripoli Program, which served as Algeria&#x27;s constitution when it won its war for independence from France in 1962, established the president as the head of state with a prime minister assisting in the operation of government. Internal political maneuvering resulted in a new constitution in 1963 that abolished the prime minister position and devolved all executive power upon the office of the president. For the first four decades of independence, the government was controlled as a one-party state by the National Liberation Front. The presidency was held by a succession of FLN members; Ahmed Ben Bella, Houari Boumédienne and Chadli Bendjedid. The constitution written in 1976 maintained the executive power of the Presidency, but the modifications of 1979 stripped the head of government status from the office.

Towards the end of the 1980s, there was a liberalization of the FLN regime. However, when the Islamic Salvation Front won parliamentary elections in 1991, the military forced Chadli Bendjedid to dissolve the parliament and resign on 11 January 1992. The military declared a state of emergency and took over government of the country, establishing a five-member High Council of State. The council appointed a president, Muhammad Boudiaf, to take office for a three-year term to facilitate a transfer back to normal elections for the office. However, Boudiaf was assassinated, and succeeded by Ali Kafi. Meanwhile, the country descended into a period of civil war, between the military government and Islamic guerrillas. Kafi was replaced in 1994 by Liamine Zéroual, who called the first of these elections in 1995, winning the full five-year term easily in disputed in election as the civil war was continuing. He called another early election in 1999, with the Islamic insurgency mostly suppressed. Abdelaziz Bouteflika won this election after all other candidates dropped out. He won re-election on 8 April 2004, in elections that were also disputed, won again in 2009, relatively unchallenged, and 2014; he declared his candidacy for a 5th term in the election scheduled for 18 April 2019, but, on 2 April 2019, he resigned before his 4th term ended, due to pressure from the military after protests.

As provided for under Article 102 of the Algerian Constitution, Abdelkader Bensalah, President of the Council of the Nation, became acting president of the country upon the resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika on 2 April 2019. His term could last for a maximum of 90 days, until elections, in which he could not participate, were held.

The current president is Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who won the 2019 Algerian presidential election on 12 December and assumed the office on 19 December 2019.

==Term limits==
As of 2021, there is a two-term limit for the president in the Constitution of Algeria. The term limit was reinstated in 2016.

<doc id="380669" wikidata="Q19057827" url="?curid=380669" title="President of Burundi">
<text>The president of Burundi, officially the President of the Republic (French: &quot;Président de la République&quot;), is the head of state and head of government of the Republic of Burundi. The president is also commander-in-chief of the National Defence Force. The office of the presidency was established when Michel Micombero declared Burundi a republic on 28 November 1966. The first constitution to specify the powers and duties of the president was the constitution of 1974 adopted in 1976. The constitution, written by Micombero, affirmed Micombero&#x27;s position as the first president of Burundi. The powers of the president currently derive from the 2005 constitution implemented as a result of the 2000 Arusha Accords after the Burundian Civil War. The current president since 18 June 2020 is Évariste Ndayishimiye.

The president&#x27;s stated role is to represent Burundi&#x27;s national unity and ensure that the laws and functions of the state are created and executed with full compliance in the constitution. The president is granted a variety of powers throughout the constitution. Title V establishes the executive powers granted to the president and Title VI establishes legislative powers granted to the president. The president has the power to appoint military commanders, ambassadors, magistrates, provincial governors and members of various national councils. The president also appoints all judges, including those of the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court. The president can organize government and can call for parliamentary sessions under extraordinary circumstances. In addition to promulgating legislation, the president has the power to propose and amend laws and can veto laws that parliament is unable to agree upon. The president can also amend the constitution. The president represents Burundi in international affairs by signing and ratifying its treaties. The president is the sole office to manage war, but needs approval from parliament and the National Council of Security to start wars. The president is the sole post that can authorize military action. The president is also the sole post to grant civil and military awards.

A presidential term is seven years, and a president can serve two terms. The president is assisted by two presidentially appointed vice-presidents; however, the 2018 Burundian constitutional referendum passed to eventually reduce the number of vice-presidents to one. The president is entitled to a pension after the end of their final term of office.

== Origin ==
In 1966, Michel Micombero became a rallying force for opposition to king Ntare V of Burundi. When Ntare V promoted Micombero to the post of Prime Minister of Burundi, Micombero launched the November 1966 Burundian coup d&#x27;état. Micombero overthrew Ntare V and declared Burundi a republic and himself its president. Micombero formalized his role as president in his 1974 constitution formally adopted in 1976. The constitution guaranteed Micombero&#x27;s presidency and established a one-party state led by the Union for National Progress (UPRONA). Political instability continued in Burundi. After the 1987 Burundian coup d&#x27;état, Pierre Buyoya seized the post of the presidency and implemented the 1992 constitution. The new constitution instituted multiparty elections in Burundi. Opposition to the change started the Burundian Civil War in 1993. In 1996, Buyoya returned to power and sought reconciliation and transition to democracy. In 2000, the Arusha Accords were signed by all three sides of the conflict, and between 2000 and 2005, Buyoya and Domitien Ndayizeye worked under the 2001 and 2004 transitional constitutions to transition Burundi to democracy. The 2005 constitution is a final product of the transition. The powers and duties of the presidency are enshrined within the 2005 constitution, which does not feature a prime minister.

== Selection ==
=== The first president post-transition ===
The 2005 constitution distinguishes between a first president and subsequent presidents. The first president is elected by a two-thirds majority vote by the National Assembly and Senate. If the first president is absent for any reason, another person is elected as first president through the same means.

=== Eligibility ===
To be eligible for the presidency, a candidate is required to be a national of Burundi by descent. Candidates must reside within Burundi when their candidacies are announced, and the candidates must be at least 40 years old upon conclusion of the election. Additionally, candidates must be valid voters and must not be facing penalty according to electoral law. Each candidate also requires 200 supporters, all of whom must also be valid voters.

The first president is not eligible for election.

=== Election process ===
Candidates for the presidency must either announce themselves as independents or be sponsored by specific political parties. Burundi&#x27;s population, endowed with universal suffrage, elects the president by an absolute majority vote in two rounds. If there is no candidate that wins an absolute majority in the first round, then a second round with the top two candidates from the first rounds is held.

The election is held between one and two months before the end of the incumbent&#x27;s tenure.

=== Post-election ===
The president is not allowed to hold other occupations during presidential tenure. If a candidate occupies another public office, their tenure in that office ends immediately upon declaration of the election results. If a candidate occupies a private sector office, they are barred from further business action immediately upon declaration of the election results.

== Succession in absence ==
If the president is temporarily unable to carry out their duties, then the first vice-president assumes the duties of the president until the president is again able to perform their role. If neither the president nor the first vice-president are present, then the second vice-president assumes the duties of the president.

If the president dies, resigns, or is otherwise made permanently unable to carry out their duties, then the duties of the president are carried out by the president of the National Assembly. If the president of the National Assembly is not able to act as president, then the vice-presidents, with assistance from the rest of the government, act jointly as president. A new election for president is immediately conducted unless an emergency has been declared by the Constitutional Court.

== Removal ==
The president can be impeached if two-thirds of both the National Assembly and Senate agree on impeachment. Grounds for impeachment include &quot;grave fault, abuse of power, corruption&quot; and high treason. The president is removed from office if the High Court of Justice convicts the president of a crime.

<doc id="380674" wikidata="Q441848" url="?curid=380674" title="Alexander McNutt (governor)">
<text>Alexander Gallatin McNutt (January 3, 1802 – October 22, 1848) was a Mississippi attorney and politician who served as Governor from 1838 to 1842.

==Early life==
Alexander G. McNutt was born into an aristocratic landowning family in Rockbridge County, Virginia on January 3, 1802. He graduated from Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in 1821, studied law, and moved to Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1820s. He subsequently relocated to Vicksburg, where he practiced in partnership with Joel Cameron. When Cameron was murdered by his slaves in 1833, McNutt subsequently married Cameron&#x27;s widow, Elizabeth Lewis Cameron. (Before the slaves were executed, a free black man who was also implicated blamed McNutt for the murder, stating that McNutt had instigated it in order to profit by Cameron&#x27;s death.)

==Political career==
A Democrat, in 1829 he served as a Selectman in Vicksburg. In 1835 McNutt was elected to the Mississippi State Senate. In 1837 he was elected President of the Senate.

McNutt ran successfully for governor in 1837 and in 1839, serving two terms from 1838 to 1842. During his term Mississippi founded its state library and procured land for construction of a state university, and construction was completed on the state penitentiary. The northern boundary with the State of Tennessee was resurveyed, but the new boundary did not result in more territory for Mississippi and the new city of Memphis proved to outside the bounds of the survey which had been an aim for some of the advocates of the resurvey.

During his governorship, McNutt opposed central banking, including Mississippi&#x27;s Planters and Union Banks, in which the state had large ownership stakes, arguing that the stockholders and managers were corrupt. The banks sold bonds in an effort to raise revenue, which the state repudiated under McNutt&#x27;s influence, leaving the state with a large debt.

After leaving office he resumed practicing law. In 1847 he ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate, losing to Henry S. Foote.

In 1848, McNutt campaigned for the presidential ticket headed by Lewis Cass and was a candidate for presidential elector. While in Desoto County, he became ill and died on October 22, 1848. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Section 6, Lot 57.

==Legacy==
McNutt&#x27;s home is a Vicksburg landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The community of McNutt, Mississippi is named in honor of McNutt.

<text>Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth, commonly referred to in-show as either Professor Farnsworth or simply Professor, is a fictional character in the American animated television series &quot;Futurama&quot;. The mad scientist proprietor of the Planet Express delivery service for whom the main characters work, he is the great (×30) grandnephew of series protagonist Philip J. Fry. He alternates between intelligence and amoral senility due to his greatly advanced age (the exact value of which has differed across episodes). He demonstrates a mastery of any field of science necessary for the series&#x27; plots and is suggested to be one of the most brilliant inventors on Earth. However, he falls asleep constantly, and he routinely sends his crews on suicide missions.

==Character==
A self-described mad scientist, the Professor is a senile, amoral, deranged, and unpredictable old man (160 years old as of &quot;A Clone of My Own&quot;) with very thick glasses and a gift for creating doomsday devices and atomic supermen. He has put at least one parallel universe in peril with his inventions and visited dozens more (see &quot;The Farnsworth Parabox&quot;).

The Professor teaches at Mars University and has worked for Momcorp on several occasions but spends most of his time inventing ridiculous devices and sending the Planet Express delivery crew on suicide missions. While at Momcorp, he fell in love with the CEO, Mom, only to leave her and Momcorp when she decided to weaponize his &quot;Q.T. McWhiskers&quot; toy. What he is a professor &quot;of&quot; is never explicitly stated. In the episode &quot;Mars University,&quot; when asked what he is teaching, he responds: &quot;The same thing I teach every semester, the mathematics of quantum neutrino fields. I made up the title so no student would dare take it&quot;; however, this declaration has not precluded the professor from demonstrating mastery of whatever field of science is convenient for a given episode&#x27;s plot, as shown in &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot; when he proclaims, &quot;I can wire anything directly into anything! I am the Professor!&quot; proceeding to link Hermes&#x27; disembodied head to the ship&#x27;s computer. Approximately 100 years before the series&#x27; timeline, he taught a young (not yet Professor) Wernstrom, whom Farnsworth regarded as a prized student. After he returned a pop quiz to Wernstrom with a grade of A-minus (for poor penmanship), the two became bitter rivals (established in &quot;A Big Piece of Garbage&quot;).

As Philip J. Fry&#x27;s great (x30) nephew, it is likely that he is the great (x29) grandson of Yancy Fry, Fry&#x27;s older brother from the 20th century. This would also make him the great (x28) grandson of Philip J. Fry II, Yancy&#x27;s son, although his exact shared family members with Fry have not been stated. However, since Fry has become his own grandfather, he is also Fry&#x27;s direct descendant, specifically his great (x31) grandson.

In &quot;All the Presidents&#x27; Heads,&quot; he reveals that he is descended from Philo Farnsworth (widely credited as the original inventor of television); Dean Farnsworth, who created the Farnsworth Lantern Test to check for color vision problems in military aviators and sailors; and David Farnsworth, a colonial-era counterfeiter and British agent who was eventually hanged for his crimes.

Many episodes&#x27; major plot points are introduced by Farnsworth announcing, &quot;Good news, everyone!&quot;—either to unveil his latest invention or describe the company&#x27;s latest delivery assignment, which is usually a suicide mission; he acknowledges this in &quot;&quot;. On the very few occasions he has &quot;actual&quot; good news, he often opens with &quot;Bad news, everyone!&quot; After Fry resigns from his job in &quot;Law &amp; Oracle&quot;, he states that he only says these phrases to make Fry &quot;feel better about his pointless job.&quot; Another is his exclamation, &quot;Sweet zombie Jesus!&quot; He often says &quot;Eh Wha?&quot; when unaware of the situation, or when someone questions a statement he has just made. The Professor often makes mutually contradictory statements just moments apart; this happens especially often when briefing his employees, with the prevailing second statement canceling a much more reassuring first sentence.

Jochen Antoni of Albert-Ludwigs-University, writing in &quot;helden. heroes. héros&quot;, says the show positions Farnsworth as &quot;a non-heroic character&quot; because of the extreme disregard he shows for other people and their safety and contrasts him with the scientist-heroes seen elsewhere in science fiction. Farnsworth views them as a means to an end, as evidenced in the first episode. After remarking that he was looking for a new crew for his intergalactic space ship, he was asked &quot;What happened to your old crew?&quot; His response was &quot;Oh, those poor sons of... — but that&#x27;s not important! What is important is that I need a new crew!&quot; Farnsworth&#x27;s employees later discover that their predecessors died while gathering not-ordinary honey from Space Bees (&quot;The Sting&quot;). The Professor issues his new crew the previous crew&#x27;s career chips from a manila envelope labeled &quot;Contents Of Space Wasp&#x27;s Stomach&quot; (&quot;Space Pilot 3000&quot;).

It was revealed in &quot;Mobius Dick&quot; that the first crew was ingested by a four-dimensional space whale in 2961, only returning to Earth when rescued by Leela in 3011. This appears to be the only crew the Professor showed some emotion towards, given his purchasing of a monument to honor the 50th year of their disappearance.

He frequently sends his crew on dangerous missions even when he has the foreknowledge that they will probably not make it back alive. His missions are typically those other delivery companies will not take, such as serving subpoenas to Mafia-controlled worlds or casual deliveries to virus-infested planets. Even the commercial that he had produced for his company makes several remarks to this effect, including &quot;When other companies aren&#x27;t crazy or foolhardy enough…&quot; and &quot;Our crew is replaceable, your package isn&#x27;t.&quot;

In one episode when the crew and his ship are sent off to war, he immediately tries to hire another crew, going so far as to assign them similar character roles; he is clearly surprised to be interrupted by his old crew returning. Even his familial relationship to Fry does not dampen the glee with which he assigns dangerous delivery missions. When asked about the nature of his delivery &quot;business&quot;, Farnsworth once clarified that he viewed his company more as &quot;a source of cheap labor, like a family.&quot; He also frequently covets his employees&#x27; organs and blood; he keeps Amy Wong around because they share a blood type and in &quot;Anthology of Interest II&quot; retrieves a pair of plastic tongs and a box labelled &quot;Leela&#x27;s organs&quot; when Leela is knocked unconscious. In &quot;How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back,&quot; he tries to encourage a suicidal Hermes Conrad to kill himself in a way that would not damage his liver because &quot;other people need it.&quot;

It is established in the episode &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; that the Professor was once Mom&#x27;s lover and employee. However, they could not maintain their relationship due to Mom&#x27;s lust for power, prompting them to break up (this reportedly happened three times). When Mom takes control of all the world&#x27;s robots to cause an uprising, her sons Walt, Larry, and Igner attempt to get the Professor to seduce Mom and retrieve the remote for the robots. They get back together briefly, but break up once more when Mom learns the Professor had been initially using her. It is revealed in &quot;Bender&#x27;s Game&quot; that the Professor is the biological father of Mom&#x27;s youngest son Igner — the one whom Mom despises the most.

Some of his more significant inventions include a hat that advanced a monkey to human-level intelligence, a race of mutant atomic supermen, a wide range of doomsday devices, and a pioneer in the development of the &#x27;modern&#x27; robots used in the 31st century.

==Production==
Professor Farnsworth is voiced by Billy West, using a combination of impressions of Burgess Meredith and Frank Morgan. West has stated that the voice for Farnsworth is meant to be a bit shaky and that when developing the voice he came up with &quot;a combination of all the wizard-type characters you heard when you were a kid, Burgess Meredith and Frank Morgan in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.&quot; There is a direct nod to this in the episode &quot;Anthology of Interest II&quot;, in which the Professor portrays the Wizard of Oz.

Many references to the pulp science fiction magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot; indicate the Professor may be named in honor of its editor Farnsworth Wright. Another possibility is that he was named after the American inventor and television pioneer Philo Farnsworth, or after the Colonial American figure David Farnsworth, who appeared in the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;All The Presidents&#x27; Heads&quot; as an ancestor of the Professor and Philip J. Fry. The Professor&#x27;s first name &quot;Hubert&quot; may have been chosen in honor of University of California Philosophy professor Hubert Dreyfus, of whom writer and producer Eric Kaplan was a former student.

Farnsworth&#x27;s design has been compared to a combination of Mr. Burns, Grampa Simpson, and Professor Frink from Matt Groening&#x27;s other series, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

In the initial storyboards of &quot;Space Pilot 3000&quot;, Fry presumes that the Professor is descended from a supposed sister and a supposed brother-in-law named Eddie Farnsworth. In the first season, Farnsworth excuses his unhelpfulness by saying that he was &quot;already in his pajamas&quot;. This was an early attempt at a catchphrase that was abandoned after &quot;The Series Has Landed&quot;.

In the &quot;Action Delivery Force&quot; segment of &quot;Reincarnation&quot;, Professor Farnsworth is voiced by David Herman.

== Legacy ==
In 2020, a new species of snake from the Western Ghats of India, &quot;Ahaetulla farnsworthi&quot;, was named after the character. One of the researchers, Achyuthan Srikanthan, was a fan of the show and character, and the species was named after Farnsworth as a reference to the character&#x27;s attempts to revive barking snakes from extinction.

<text>Walter Daniel Leake (May 20, 1762November 17, 1825) was a judge, U.S. senator, and governor of Mississippi. He served as a United States Senator from Mississippi (1817–1820), as a justice in 1821, and as third Governor of Mississippi (1822–1825). He was the first Governor of Mississippi to die in office.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Walter Leake was born on May 20, 1762, in Albemarle County in the Colony of Virginia. He was the son of Captain Mask Leake and nephew of Rev. Samuel Leake (Princeton University graduate and a member of the first Board of Trustees of Hampden–Sydney College), an ancestor of Senator John McCain of Arizona. Walter Leake was descended from John Leake. Leake served in the American Revolutionary War, serving in the Battle of Yorktown according to Marquis de Lafayette, and later served in Virginia&#x27;s General Assembly.

===Career===
Leake was appointed a judge in the Territory of Mississippi in 1807, and he settled in Claiborne County, and he would serve as a delegate to Mississippi&#x27;s Constitutional Convention of 1817 for this county. Leake served as a United States Senator for the State of Mississippi from 1817 to 1820. While in the Senate, Leake served as Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs. In 1820, Leake was appointed United States Marshall for the District of Mississippi, and then was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Mississippi Supreme Court in 1821, and went on to serve as the governor of Mississippi from 1822 to 1825.

=== Governor of Mississippi ===
On August 6, 1821, Walter Leake was elected the 3rd Governor of Mississippi. He faced attorney and state legislator Charles B Green in the general election. During his first administration, Leake signed a law to eliminate debtor&#x27;s prisons in Mississippi and attempted to promote a law to abolish dueling. Leake oversaw the expansion of Mississippi&#x27;s road system, extending roads from the state&#x27;s new capitol, Jackson, to other settlements in Mississippi. In the 1823 gubernatorial election, Leake was reelected, defeating former Congressional Delegate William Lattimore and Lieutenant Governor David Dickson. Leake died in Mount Salus, Mississippi (now named Clinton) on November 17, 1825, while serving as Governor of Mississippi.

===Personal life===
Leake married. His daughter, Susan Wingfield Leake, married Henry Goodloe Johnston of Spotsylvania County, Virginia, in 1807 and was an ancestor of Haley Barbour.

==Legacy==
Leake County, Mississippi, as well as Leakesville, Mississippi, are named for him.

<text>The Bannik () is a bathhouse (&quot;banya&quot;) spirit in Slavic mythology. He is usually described as a small, naked old man with a long beard, his body covered in the birch leaves left over from well used bath brooms. Many accounts also claim that he is a shapeshifter and can appear as a local person to someone who stumbles across him, or even as a stone or coal in the oven heating the bathhouse. Slavic bathhouses resemble saunas, with an inner steaming room and an outer changing room. A place where women gave birth and practiced divinations, the bathhouse was strongly endowed with vital forces. The third firing (or fourth, depending on tradition) was reserved for the bannik, and, given his inclination to invite demons and forest spirits to share his bath, no Christian images were allowed lest they offend the occupants. If disturbed by an intruder while washing, the bannik might pour boiling water over him, or even strangle him.

There were several rituals performed in order to keep the bannik happy and peaceful. The most common occurred during the steaming/firing that was reserved for the spirit itself or upon the quitting of the banya for the night; offerings of fir branches, water and soap were left, capped by a formal thank you uttered aloud. The bannik was often blamed for anything that went wrong within the bathhouse, so if the structure burned down (which they often did), it was believed the spirit had been affronted in some way. In order to appease the bannik, upon the rebuilding of a banya, a black hen would be suffocated, left unplucked and buried beneath the building&#x27;s threshold. The people performing this ritual would end it by bowing and backing away from the threshold, while reciting appropriate incantations.

The banya was considered a liminal space among Slavic peasants and thus, was considered &quot;unclean&quot;, or a place of possible spiritual danger. Despite this, most births occurred inside the banya and it was believed that the bannik was not truly happy or settled until a child was born within his domain.

The bannik had the ability to predict the future. One consulted him by standing with one&#x27;s back exposed in the half-open door of the bath. The bannik would gently stroke one&#x27;s back if all boded well; but if trouble lay ahead, he would strike with his claws.

<doc id="380683" wikidata="Q4357557" url="?curid=380683" title="Endowment (Mormonism)">
<text>In Mormonism, the endowment is a two-part ordinance designed for participants to become kings, queens, priests, and priestesses in the afterlife. As part of the first ceremony, participants take part in a scripted reenactment of the Biblical creation and fall of Adam and Eve. The ceremony includes a symbolic washing and anointing, and receipt of a &quot;new name&quot; which they are not to reveal to others except at a certain part in the ceremony, and the receipt of the temple garment, which Mormons then are expected to wear under their clothing day and night throughout their life. Participants are taught symbolic gestures and passwords considered necessary to pass by angels guarding the way to heaven, and are instructed not to reveal them to others. As practiced today in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the endowment also consists of a series of covenants (promises to God) that participants make, such as a covenant of consecration to the LDS Church. All LDS Church members who choose to serve as missionaries or participate in a celestial marriage in a temple must first complete the first endowment ceremony.

The second part of the endowment, called the second anointing, is the pinnacle ordinance of the temple, jointly given to a husband and wife couple to ensure salvation, guarantee exaltation, and confer godhood. Participants are anointed kings, queens, priests, and priestesses, whereas in the first endowment they are only anointed to become those contingent to following specified covenants. The second anointing is only given to a select group, and its existence is not widely known among the general membership.

The endowment as practiced today was instituted by founder Joseph Smith in the 1840s with further contributions by Brigham Young and his successors. The ceremony is performed in Latter Day Saint temples, which are dedicated specifically for the endowment and certain other ordinances sacred to Mormons, and are open only to Mormons who meet certain requirements. There was a brief period during the construction of the Salt Lake Temple where a small building referred to as the Endowment House was used to administer the endowment ordinance. The endowment is currently practiced by the LDS Church, several denominations of Mormon fundamentalism, and a few other Mormon denominations. The LDS Church has altered the ceremony throughout its history.

A distinct endowment ceremony was also performed in the 1830s in the Kirtland Temple, the first temple of the broader Latter Day Saint movement, which includes other smaller churches such as the Community of Christ. The term &quot;endowment&quot; thus has various meanings historically, and within the other branches of the Latter Day Saint movement.

About two-thirds of US members reported having current authorization from their local leadership to participate in temple ordinances in a 2012 survey. Estimates show that fewer than half of converts to the LDS Church ultimately undergo the first endowment ceremony, and young people preparing for missions account for about one-third of &quot;live&quot; endowments (as contrasted with proxy endowments for the deceased). The less common second endowment ceremony had been given 15,000 times by 1941, but has become less frequent in modern times.

==Previous Latter Day Saint endowments==

The meaning and scope of the term &quot;endowment&quot; evolved during the early Latter Day Saint movement, of which Mormonism is a part. The term derives from the Authorized King James Version, referring to the spiritual gifts given the disciples of Jesus on the day of Pentecost, in which they were &quot;endowed with power from on high,&quot; Christians generally understand this endowment to refer to the gift of the Holy Spirit, which the Latter Day Saints believe is given at the Confirmation ceremony. In 1831, however, Smith began teaching that the elders of the church needed to be further &quot;endowed with power from on high&quot; in order to be effective proselytizers. He therefore gathered the elders together at a general conference in June 1831 and &quot;endowed&quot; them with this power by ordaining them to the High Priesthood.

By the mid-1830s, Smith was teaching that a further endowment was necessary, this time requiring the completion of the Kirtland Temple as a house of God where God could pour out his Holy Spirit. Upon the completion of the Kirtland Temple after three years of construction (1833–1836), the elders of the church gathered for this second promised endowment in early 1836. The Kirtland endowment included a ritual ceremony involving preparatory washings and anointings with oil, followed by a gathering in the temple in which many reported spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and visions.

===The Nauvoo endowment===

====Overview====
The Nauvoo endowment consists of two phases: (1) an initiation, and (2) an instructional and testing phase. The initiation consists of a washing and anointing, culminating in the clothing of the patron in a &quot;Garment of the Holy Priesthood&quot;, which is thereafter worn as an undergarment.

The instructional and testing phase of the endowment consists of a scripted reenactment of Adam and Eve&#x27;s experience in the Garden of Eden (performed by live actors—called officiators; in the mid-20th century certain portions were adapted to a film presentation). The instruction is punctuated with oaths, symbolic gestures, and a prayer around an altar, and at the end of instruction, the initiate&#x27;s knowledge of symbolic gestures and key-words is tested at a &quot;veil.&quot;

====Introduction====
On May 3, 1842, Joseph Smith prepared the second floor of his Red Brick Store, in Nauvoo, Illinois, to represent &quot;the interior of a temple as circumstances would permit&quot;. The next day, May 4, he introduced the Nauvoo endowment ceremony to nine associates.

Throughout 1843 and 1844 Smith continued to initiate other men, as well as women, into the endowment ceremony. By the time of his death on June 27, 1844, more than 50 persons had been admitted into the Anointed Quorum, the name by which this group called themselves.

====The Nauvoo endowment and Freemasonry====
There are many similarities between Smith&#x27;s endowment ceremony and certain rituals of Freemasonry, particularly the Royal Arch degree (although, there is no evidence that he ever saw the Royal Arch degree or joined a Royal Arch Chapter). These specific similarities included instruction in various signs, tokens, and passwords, and the imposition of various forms of the penalties for revealing them. The original wording of the penalties, for example, closely followed the graphic wording of the Masonic penalties.

According to the predominant view by historians, Smith used and adapted material from the Masonic rituals in creating the endowment ceremony. All of those first initiated by Smith on May 4, 1842, were longstanding or recent Masons: James Adams was the Deputy Grand Master of the Masonic Grand Lodge of Illinois; Newell K. Whitney, George Miller and Heber C. Kimball had previously been Lodge Masters; Smith&#x27;s brother, Hyrum, had been a Mason since 1827; and the remaining five participants (Law, Marks, Young, Richards, and Smith himself) had been initiated as Freemasons just weeks before the meeting. However, none of these Masons ever charged Smith with breaking any of Masonry&#x27;s oaths or revealing its secrets. In contrast to those that believe Smith simply copied these rituals to advance his own religion, one Mormon historian has noted that these Masonic parallels confirmed to these men &quot;the breath of the restoration impulse and was evidence of Smith&#x27;s divine calling&quot;.

The LDS Church has never commented officially on these similarities, although certain features of the two rituals have been called &quot;analogous&quot; by one official Church Historian and the apostle Jeffrey R. Holland stated in a BBC interview that endowment ordinance vows to secrecy are &quot;similar to a Masonic relationship.&quot; The LDS Church apostle John A. Widtsoe downplayed the similarities, arguing that they &quot;do not deal with the basic matters [the endowment] but rather with the mechanism of the ritual.&quot; One LDS Church educator, however, was censured in the 1970s by the Church Educational System for arguing that the endowment ceremony had a dependent relationship with the rituals of freemasonry.

Some within the LDS Church, particularly Smith&#x27;s contemporaries, have expressed the view that the endowment was given anciently by God in its original form at the Temple of Solomon, but that the form of the ritual degenerated into the form used by Freemasons. Heber C. Kimball clearly supported this position: &quot;We have the true Masonry. The Masonry of today is received from the apostasy which took place in the days of Solomon and David. They have now and then a thing that is correct, but we have the real thing.&quot;

===Later modifications by the LDS Church===
After Smith officiated in Brigham Young&#x27;s endowment in 1842 Smith told him, &quot;Brother Brigham, this is not arranged perfectly; however we have done the best we could under the circumstances in which we are placed. I wish you to take this matter in hand: organize and systematize all these ceremonies&quot;. Young did as Smith directed, and under Young&#x27;s direction the Nauvoo endowment ceremony was introduced to the church at large in the Nauvoo Temple during the winter of 1845–1846. A spacious hall in the temple&#x27;s attic was arranged into appropriate ordinance &quot;rooms&quot; using canvas partitions. Potted plants were used in areas representing the Garden of Eden, and other areas were furnished appropriately, including a room representing the celestial kingdom. Over 5,500 persons received their endowments in this temple.

Young introduced the same ceremony in the Utah Territory in the 1850s, first in the Endowment House and then in the St. George Temple. During this period the ceremony had never been written down, but was passed orally from temple worker to worker. Shortly after the dedication of the St. George Temple, and before his death in 1877, Young became concerned about the possibility of variations in the ceremony within the church&#x27;s temples and so directed the majority of the text of the endowment to be written down. This document became the standard for the ceremony thereafter. Also in 1877, the first endowments for the dead were performed in the St. George Temple.

In 1893, minor alterations in the text were made in an attempt to bring uniformity to the ceremony as administered in the temples. Between 1904 and 1906, the temple ceremony received very public scrutiny during the 1904 Senate investigation of LDS Apostle and U.S. Senator, Reed Smoot. Of particular concern to senators was the ceremony&#x27;s &quot;law of vengeance&quot;, in which, during the hearings, it was revealed that participants took an oath of vengeance to pray that God would &quot;avenge the blood of the prophets on this nation&quot;. The &quot;prophets&quot; were Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and &quot;this nation&quot; was the United States.

Beginning in 1919, church president Heber J. Grant appointed a committee charged with revising the ceremony, which was done under the direction of Apostle George F. Richards from 1921 to 1927. Richards received permission to write down the previously unwritten portions of the ceremony. Among his revisions was the elimination of the &quot;law of vengeance&quot;. Previous versions of the ceremony into the 1880s also had the representative of the Lord cut the symbols in the garments with a knife through the veil, with one source suggesting an early version cut into the knee of the participant to create a scar. The committee also removed the violent language from the penalty portions of the ceremony. Prior to 1927, participants made an oath that if they ever revealed the secret gestures of the ceremony, they would be subject to the following:

Each temple president received a &quot;President&#x27;s Book&quot; with the revised ceremony ensuring uniformity throughout the church&#x27;s temples.

The first filmed versions of the endowment were introduced in the 1950s, by a committee headed by Gordon B. Hinckley. That change was initiated by church president David O. McKay as a way of providing the instruction simultaneously in different languages, an innovation made necessary by the construction of the Bern Switzerland Temple, the church&#x27;s first temple in Europe. , ceremonies in all but two (Salt Lake Temple and Manti Temple) of the church&#x27;s 128 operating temples are presented using the filmed version.

In 1990, further changes included the elimination of all blood oaths and penalties. These penalties, representing what the member would rather suffer than reveal the sacred signs given them in the ceremony, were symbolized by gestures for having the throat cut, the breast cut open, and the bowels torn out. Changes also included the elimination of the five points of fellowship, the role of the preacher, and all reference to Lucifer&#x27;s &quot;popes and priests&quot; were dropped.

The ceremony was also changed to lessen the differences in treatment between men and women. Women no longer are required to covenant to obey their husbands, but instead must covenant only to follow their husbands as their husbands follow God. Also, Eve is no longer explicitly blamed for the Fall or told that Adam &quot;shall rule over thee&quot;, and several references to Adam were replaced with references to Adam and Eve. The lecture at the veil was also cut, and some repetition was eliminated.

In the temple endowment, women were previously urged to be a priestess &quot;unto her husband,&quot; while men were promised they will be priests to God. In January 2019, that topic was removed from the endowment process, in accordance with other changes that included more lines for Eve in their ritual performance of the Book of Genesis. Also in 2019, a letter from the church&#x27;s First Presidency stated that &quot;Veiling an endowed woman&#x27;s face prior to burial is optional.&quot; It had previously been required. The letter went on to say that such veiling, &quot;may be done if the sister expressed such a desire while she was living. In cases where the wishes of the deceased sister on this matter are not known, her family should be consulted.&quot;

The Church announced in 1988 that 100 million vicarious endowments had been performed on behalf of deceased persons.

==Modern endowment as practiced by the LDS Church==

The most well-known Mormon endowment ceremony is that performed by the LDS Church in its temples. This ceremony is open only to members of the church deemed worthy and given a &quot;temple recommend&quot; by their priesthood leaders after one or more personal interviews. It comprises four parts:
# An initiatory composed of the preparatory ordinances of washing and anointing
# An instructional portion with lectures and representations
# The making of covenants (i.e. oaths)
# A testing of knowledge

===The initiatory===

The &quot;initiatory&quot; is a prelude to the endowment proper, similar to Chrismation, and consists of:

# Instruction
# Symbolic washing and anointing ordinances
# Being clothed in the temple garment
# Receiving a &quot;new name&quot; in preparation for the endowment.

Preceded only by sealings in 1831, washing and anointing ceremonies are perhaps the earliest practiced temple ordinances for the living since the organization of the LDS Church. There is evidence that these ordinances have been performed since 1832 when they were first practiced in the Whitney Store as part of the School of the Prophets, and were subsequently implemented in the Kirtland endowment.

As part of the endowment ceremony, the ordinance of washing and anointing symbolizes the ritual cleansing of priests that took place at Israel&#x27;s Tabernacle, Solomon&#x27;s Temple, and the Second Temple, later known as Herod&#x27;s Temple. The washing symbolizes being &quot;cleansed from the blood of this generation,&quot; and being anointed to become &quot;clean from the blood and sins of this generation.&quot;

After the washing and anointing, the patron is given the temple garment, formally called the &quot;Garment of the Holy Priesthood&quot;. This garment represents the &quot;coats of skins&quot; given to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.

Similar ordinances are performed for the living and the dead in LDS temples, where men are:
* Ordained to the priesthood (for the dead only, since a man coming to the temple for his own endowment would have previously received his Melchizedek priesthood ordination)
* Washed with water (which only involves a cursory sprinkling of water)
* Blessed to have the washing sealed
* Anointed with oil
* Blessed to have the anointing sealed
* Clothed in holy garments
Women receive the same ordinances, except for the ordination.
As the final part of the initiatory, the patron is given a new name, which is a key word used during the ceremony. In general, this name is only known to the person to whom it is given; however, an endowed LDS woman reveals her name to her endowed husband (but not vice versa).

===The instructional portion===

The endowment focuses on LDS belief in a plan of salvation and changes to the ceremony in 2023 included more discussion of Jesus. Parts of the doctrine of the plan of salvation explained include:

*The eternal Nature of God, of Jesus Christ, and their divinity
*The pre-mortal existence and eternal nature of man (mankind lived with God before mortal life)
*The reality of Satan, who is Jesus&#x27; and Adam&#x27;s rebellious spirit brother
*The fall of Adam and the reasons for mortality, trials, and blessings
*The Atonement of Jesus Christ, and the need for the Atonement
*The relationship of grace, faith, and works
*Death, the literal resurrection, and qualifying for one of the three kingdoms of glory (or Outer Darkness)
*The need for personal righteousness, covenant keeping, and love of God and fellow man
*That Heavenly Father loves humanity as his children and wants people to become like he is, to receive joy
*The sanctity and eternal nature of the family

The endowment is often thought of as a series of lectures where Latter-day Saints are taught about the creation of the world, the events in the Garden of Eden, what happened after Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden into the &quot;telestial world&quot;, and the progression of righteous individuals through &quot;terrestrial&quot; laws to one of the kingdoms of glory and exaltation.

During the ceremony, Latter-day Saints are dressed in temple clothes or temple robes, are taught in ordinance rooms about various gospel laws (including obedience, chastity, sacrifice and consecration) and make covenants to obey these laws. The early Mormon leader Brigham Young taught that participants are given &quot;signs and tokens&quot; that &quot;enable you to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels who stand as sentinels&quot; and gain eternal exaltation. At the end of the ceremony, the participant is &quot;tested&quot; at the veil on their knowledge of what they were taught and covenanted to do, and then admitted into the celestial room, where they may meditate and pray, but are discouraged from lingering.

===Covenant portion===

The LDS Church defines a covenant as a sacred promise one makes to God.

The temple ceremony involves entering into five covenants:
# Law of Obedience, which includes striving to keep God&#x27;s commandments.
# Law of Sacrifice, which means doing all that is possible to support the Lord&#x27;s work and repenting with a broken heart and contrite spirit.
# Law of the Gospel, which refers to the higher law that Jesus Christ taught, including baptism, repentance, and being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
# Law of Chastity, which means having sexual relations only with the person to whom an individual is legally and lawfully married, according to God&#x27;s law.
# Law of Consecration, which means dedicating time, talents, and everything the Lord has blessed an individual with to build up the church.

The promise given in the ceremony is that those who remain faithful will be endowed &quot;with power from on high.&quot;
===Testing portion===

At the end of the endowment ceremony the participant is tested at a physical veil by a man representing the Lord on the signs and tokens just learned. Before 1990 at the veil the participant also put their arm around and pressed their cheek, shoulders, knees and feet against the person through the veil in what was called &quot;the five points of fellowship.&quot;

===Requirements for participation===

The endowment is open only to Mormons who have a valid &quot;temple recommend.&quot; To be eligible to receive a temple recommend, one must be deemed worthy by church leadership and have been a member of the LDS Church for at least one year. A male member of the church must hold the Melchizedek priesthood to participate in the endowment. A temple recommend is signed by the person receiving the recommend, a member of the person&#x27;s bishopric and a member of the stake presidency, who each perform a personal, one-on-one &quot;worthiness interview.&quot; Persons seeking a recommend to attend the temple for the first time and receive their endowment will generally meet with their bishop and stake president.

These interviews cover what the church believes to be the most important factors of personal morality and worthiness, including whether the person has a basic belief in key church doctrines such as the divinity of Jesus and the restoration; whether the person attends church meetings and supports the leadership of the LDS Church; whether the person affiliates with Mormon fundamentalists or other people considered by the church to be apostate; whether the person is honest and lives the law of chastity and the Word of Wisdom; whether the person abuses family members; whether the person pays tithing and any applicable spousal or child support; and whether the person has confessed to serious past sins.

Prior to participating in the endowment, members of the LDS Church frequently participate in a six-part temple preparation class which discusses temple-related topics but does not directly discuss the details of the ceremony.

====Ineligible groups of members====

Some members of the church were historically or are currently ineligible for the temple endowment. For about 130 years (between 1847 and 1978) all LDS endowment-related temple ordinances were denied to all Black women and men in a controversial temple racial restriction. As of 2023, all temple ordinances including the endowment continue to be denied for any lesbian, gay, or bisexual person who is in a same-sex marriage or homosexual sexual relationship. Transgender individuals who gender transition (even if just by changing their name, pronouns and gender presentation by clothing and hairstyle) are also barred from temple ordinances as of 2020. These restrictions have received criticism from both outside, and inside the LDS church.

===Held sacredness and perceived secrecy===

In the modern endowment ceremony, recipients explicitly agree to a &quot;covenant of non-disclosure&quot; to keep some content such as the ceremony&#x27;s signs and tokens (and formerly penalties) confidential. The remainder of the ceremony carries with it no covenants of secrecy. Most Latter-day Saints are generally unwilling to discuss specific details of the ceremony, and have been instructed by top church leaders that the only place where the temple ceremonies should be discussed, even amongst faithful members, is within the temple. The apostle David A. Bednar said temple ceremonies are &quot;not secret; they&#x27;re sacred.&quot; Many Mormons hold the making of these covenants to be highly sacred, and believe that details of the ceremony should be kept from those who are not properly prepared.
====Penalties====
Prior to revisions in 1990, the LDS Church&#x27;s version of the endowment included penalties which were specified punishment for breaking an oath of secrecy after receiving the Nauvoo endowment ceremony. Adherents promised they would submit to execution in specific ways should they reveal certain contents of the ceremony. In the ceremony participants each symbolically enacted three of the methods of their execution. In 1990 the LDS Church removed the &quot;penalty&quot; portions of the ceremony. Aspects of the ceremony held confidential have been published in various sources, unauthorized by the LDS Church.

==== Historical organizational statements on confidentiality ====
Official church publications have consistently stated that temple ceremonies are confidential and not to be discussed outside the temple, but the degree and breadth of information shared has shifted over time. The non-public nature of the endowment is implied early on by a reference in facsimile no. 2 in the Book of Abraham (part of the LDS Church standard works dated to 1835) when it states that there are things that &quot;cannot be revealed unto the world; but is to be had in the Holy Temple of God.&quot;

In 1904, B. H. Roberts declared in testimony to the United States Senate that certain aspects of the endowment ceremony were intended to be &quot;secret from the world&quot;. This information includes, in the initiation and instructional/testing phases of the endowment ceremony, certain &quot;names&quot; and symbolic gestures called &quot;tokens&quot; and &quot;signs.&quot;

In 2021, the online versions of the General Handbook the specific covenants made during the endowment have been enumerated. This is the only new item that was not publicly discussed about the endowment that was added. Since that publication, the covenants made and their doctrinal implications have been discussed in more public forums including the publication of an article listing the covenants made and explaining their significance.

==== Perceived implications of confidentiality policy ====
Some Mormons have suggested that the reluctance to discuss the endowment encourages attacks and unauthorized exposés by evangelical Christians and others, and therefore advocate a more transparent attitude toward the ceremony. Transparency has increased a little bit since such criticisms were levied.

===Latter-day Saint scholars&#x27; statements comparing modern endowment to ancient practices===
The Latter-day Saint viewpoint is that the endowment is of ancient origin, revealed from the earliest time to the biblical Adam. Much research has been done by Latter Day Saints finding parallels between the endowment and ancient traditions. The LDS Church temple is referred to as a &quot;house of learning&quot; since it is a &quot;kind of educational environment teaching by action and educating through ritual.&quot; The endowment ordinance, as presented in Latter-day Saint temples, has been referred to as a &quot;ritual drama&quot; that commemorates episodes of sacred history due to its &quot;theatrical setting.&quot; When viewed as a restoration of ancient rites, the ritual drama and aesthetic environment in which the endowment is presented are both rich in Judeo-Christian symbolism. Comparative studies of the art, architecture, and rituals found in Mormonism, such as the endowment, reveal parallels to early Catholic and Jewish traditions.

The &quot;Testament of Levi&quot; discusses ceremonies and clothing that LDS scholar Blake Ostler relates to the modern LDS endowment. Some scholars have suggested that Jewish temple initiation was later merged with early Christian baptismal initiation sometime after the destruction of the Second Temple. By the fourth century CE, Christian baptism had adopted a much more dramatic and complex set of rituals accompanying it, including washing ceremonies, physical anointing with oil, being signed with a cross on the forehead, and receiving white garments and a new name, all which paralleled the Jewish initiation for priests and kings. St. Cyril of Jerusalem, in his &quot;Catechetical Lectures&quot;, related the anointing with oil at baptism with the anointing of a priest and king in the Old Testament, suggesting that the initiate actually became a priest and king in Christ.

The general theme of ascension through multiple gates or veils of heaven is found all throughout early Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and other Near Eastern religious writings, as well as in the Bible. Early works often describe angels and other sentinels which are set at these points, and several of these state that the ascending individual would be required to give specific signs and names to the sentinels in order to pass through the veil. The descriptions of key words, signs, and tokens being presented to the sentinels of the veils of heaven are particularly prevalent in old Gnostic Christian and Mandaean writings, and in Jewish lore. In one of the &quot;Nag Hammadi&quot; texts, Jesus promises that those who accept him would pass by each of the gates of heaven without fear and would be perfected in the third heaven. The Coptic &quot;Book of 1 Jeu&quot; describes Jesus instructing the apostles in the hand-signs, names, and seals that they must use before the guardians of heaven would remove the veils of heaven to allow them passage. In &quot;Hekhalot Rabbati&quot; 17:1–20:3, an old Jewish esoteric text, the faithful pass through seven doors in order to enter the presence of God, passing by angels whose names they must give, while presenting a seal. &quot;3 Enoch&quot; also describes the names and seals given to the angels.

The Latter Day Saint temple garment is usually identified by Mormon scholars with the sacred &quot;linen breeches&quot; (&quot;michnasayim/mikhnesei bahd&quot;) and the &quot;coat of linen&quot; (&quot;kuttoneth&quot;) that ancient Israelite priests were commanded to wear. According to the &quot;Talmud&quot;, worn-out undergarments and priestly sashes were burned, being used as torch wicks in the temple. The temple garment has been compared to the modern &quot;tallit katan&quot;, a sacred undershirt of Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Judaism. Both the temple garments in Mormonism and the &quot;tallit katan&quot; are meant to be worn all day under regular clothing as a constant reminder of the covenants, promises, and obligations the wearer is under. Latter-day Saint scholars interpret a biblical scripture in Luke as instructing the apostles to wait for both the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost and the endowment ceremony before going out to evangelize.

<text>Kikimora (Ukrainian and ) is a legendary creature, a female house spirit in Slavic mythology. Her role in the house is usually juxtaposed with that of the domovoy. The kikimora can either be a &quot;bad&quot; or a &quot;good&quot; spirit, which will depend on the behavior of the homeowner. In more recent times an image of kikimora as a female swamp spirit had developed.

==Etymology==
Most sources link the suffix -&quot;mora&quot; with the Proto-Slavic *&quot;morà&quot; (&#x27;nightly spirit, bad dream&#x27;) and the Proto-Germanic *&quot;marōn&quot; (&quot;id.&quot;), as in the modern English nightmare.

In Polish folklore, mora are the souls of living people that leave the body during the night, and are seen as wisps of straw or hair or as moths. Accordingly, Polish &quot;mora&quot;, Czech &quot;můra&quot; denote both a kind of elf or spirit as well as a &quot;sphinx moth&quot; or &quot;night butterfly&quot;. Other Slavic languages with cognates that have the double meaning of moth are: Kashubian &quot;mòra&quot;, and Slovak &quot;mora&quot;.

In Slovene, Croatian and Serbian, &quot;mora&quot; refers to a &quot;nightmare&quot;. &quot;Mora&quot; or &quot;Mara&quot; is one of the spirits from ancient Slav mythology. Mara was a dark spirit that takes a form of a beautiful woman and then visits men in their dreams, torturing them with desire, and dragging life out of them. In Serbia, a mare is called &quot;mora&quot;, or &quot;noćnik/noćnica&quot; (&quot;night creature&quot;, masculine and feminine respectively). In Romania they were known as &quot;Moroi&quot;.

The word &quot;kikimora&quot; may have derived from the Udmurt (Finno-Ugric) word &quot;kikka-murt&quot;, meaning &quot;scarecrow&quot; (literally &quot;bag-made person&quot;).

== History ==
The origin of the kikimora comes from the 8th to 13th century when Slavic paganism was slowly subsumed by Christianity. However, even after Christianity took hold in the Slavic regions, the belief of the kikimora was still strong. Belief in the entity still continues today where it is imbued with old Slavic folk religion and Christianity&#x27;s concept of demonic forces.

==Features and behaviours==
The kikimora might have the snout of a dog, a chicken beak or can even resemble a goat-like entity with glowing eyes and horns. In fact, it can take any part of an animal&#x27;s face or body. It is always feminine and can appear as an old woman or a beautiful girl. She might even appear as a deceased family member.

The swamp kikimora is usually described as a small, ugly, hunchbacked, thin, and scruffy old woman with a pointed nose and disheveled hair. She was said to use moss and grass as clothes. It was believed that she frightens people, knocks travelers off the road or even drowns them. She also kidnaps children.

It is a common belief that &quot;mora&quot; enters the room through the keyhole, sits on the chest of the sleepers and tries to strangle them (hence &quot;moriti&quot;, &quot;to torture&quot;, &quot;to bother&quot;, &quot;to strangle&quot;). To repel &quot;moras&quot;, children are advised to look at the window or to turn the pillow and make a sign of cross on it (&quot;prekrstiti jastuk&quot;); in the early 19th century, Vuk Karadžić mentions that people would repel &quot;moras&quot; by leaving a broom upside down behind the door, or putting their belt on top of their sheets, or saying an elaborate prayer poem before they go to sleep.

There are two different kinds of kikimoras. The one that comes from the forest is married to the Domovoi. The other one comes from the swamp () and is married to Leshy. It is said that she can be identified by her wet footprints. When home builders wanted to cause harm to someone buying a house, they would bring in kikimora. Once she is inside, it is difficult to get her to leave.

There is a Russian bylichka about one swamp kikimora, who loved to brew beer. Her name was Baba Bolotnitsa (). When she was brewing beer, fog rose over the river (or swamp).

When the house is in order, kikimora looks after the chickens and housework. If not, she whistles, breaks dishes, and makes noises at night. She also comes out at night to spin thread.

== Legacy ==
The legendary kikimora provides the basis of &quot;Kikimora&quot; (op. 63), a tone poem for orchestra by Anatoly Lyadov. Lyadov wrote that she &quot;grows up with a magician in the mountains. From dawn to sunset the magician’s cat regales kikimora with fantastic tales of ancient times and faraway places, as kikimora rocks in a cradle made of crystal. It takes her seven years to reach maturity, by which time her head is no larger than a thimble and her body no wider than a strand of straw. Kikimora spins flax from dusk and to dawn, with evil intentions for the world.&quot;

Russian &quot;New Age&quot; writer Vladimir Megre mentions the kikimora in &quot;The Space of Love&quot;, Book 3 of his &quot;Ringing Cedars&quot; series. Megre likens a man who marries unwisely based on looks and fashion to one who marries a kikimora. A footnote in the English version describes the kikimora as a malevolent female ghost said to attach itself to a particular house and disturb the inhabitants, males in particular. By extension, the term may also suggest an ugly woman in shabby clothing, ill-tempered and grumbling, striving to make the life of her husband (and men in general) unbearable.

In 1988, Kirill Eskov discovered and described a new genus and species of sheetweaver spider, &quot;Kikimora palustris&quot;, named after this spirit.

The 2015 video game &quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot; and 2019 television series &quot;The Witcher&quot; both include depictions of kikimory.

Kikimora is an antagonistic character in the animated TV show &quot;The Owl House&quot;. It has no relation to the folklore character.

Infantry in Russia and Ukraine use &quot;kikimora&quot; camouflage clothing - ragged and mossy-looking - to blend into appropriate landscapes.

== Cultural analysis ==
The concept of the kikimora is thought to serve basic functions and duties of the household. A kikimora would haunt a household if a woman did not keep a clean house; if a husband was lazy or abusive; or if children were poorly disciplined. Reversing one&#x27;s behaviour is believed to remove her presence from the house. Besides that, the kikimora entity is thought to console or explain tragic events like the death of a family member or the loss of household items.

<text>Lakanica is type of supernatural being from traditional Polish folklore who is a spirit of the fields or meadows. These are reputed to be shy and elusive creatures who can appear in human female form. 
==Similarity to the rusalki==
Scholar Alanna Muniz notes the range of such creatures in stories from western Slavic cultures that share a common non-hierarchical religion. A Lakanica was similar to other types &quot;ovily/rusalki&quot;, spirits who “are believed to reside in or near lakes, springs, rivers, and marshes, although they are also connected to fields, trees, and woods in some locations.”
==Depiction in fiction==
A Lakanica and other mythological characters play a role in the 21st century novel &quot;The Dollmaker of Kraków&quot;, set before and during World War II.
