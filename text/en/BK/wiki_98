<text>African-American music is a broad term covering a diverse range of musical genres largely developed by African Americans and their culture. Its origins are in musical forms that developed as a result of the enslavement of African Americans prior to the American Civil War. It has been said that &quot;every genre that is born from America has black roots.&quot;

White slave owners subjugated their slaves physically, mentally, and spiritually through brutal and demeaning acts. Some White Americans considered African Americans separate and unequal for centuries, going to extraordinary lengths to keep them oppressed. African-American slaves created a distinctive type of music that played an important role in the era of enslavement. Slave songs, commonly known as work songs, were used to combat the hardships of the physical labor. Work songs were also used to communicate with other slaves without the slave owner hearing. The song &quot;Wade in the Water&quot; was sung by slaves to warn others trying to leave to use the water to obscure their trail. Following the Civil War, African Americans employed playing European music in military bands developed a new style called ragtime that gradually evolved into jazz. Jazz incorporated the sophisticated polyrhythmic structure of dance and folk music of peoples from western and Sub-Saharan Africa. These musical forms had a wide-ranging influence on the development of music within the United States and around the world during the 20th century.

Analyzing African music through the lens of European musicology can leave out much of the cultural use of sound and methods of music making. Some methods of African music making are translated more clearly though the music itself, and not in written form.

Blues and ragtime were developed during the late 19th century through the fusion of West African vocalizations, which employed the natural harmonic series and blue notes. &quot;If one considers the five criteria given by Waterman as cluster characteristics for West African music, one finds that three have been well documented as being characteristic of Afro-American music. Call-and-response organizational procedures, dominance of a percussive approach to music, and off-beat phrasing of melodic accents have been cited as typical of the genre in virtually every study of any kind of African-American music from work songs, field or street calls, shouts, and spirituals to blues and jazz.&quot;

The roots of American popular music are deeply intertwined with African-American contributions and innovation. The earliest jazz and blues recordings emerged in the 1910s, marking the beginning of a transformative era in music. These genres were heavily influenced by African musical traditions, and they served as the foundation for many musical developments in the years to come.

As African-American musicians continued to shape the musical landscape, the 1940s witnessed the emergence of rhythm and blues (R&amp;B). R&amp;B became a pivotal genre, blending elements of jazz, blues, and gospel, and it laid the groundwork for the evolution of rock and roll in the following decade.

==Historic traits==

Most slaves arrived to the Americas from the western coast of Africa. This area encompasses modern-day Nigeria, Benin, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Gambia and parts of Sierra Leone. Harmonic and rhythmic features from these areas, European musical instrumentation, and the chattel slavery forced upon Black Americans all contributed to their music.

Many of the characteristic musical forms that define African-American music have historical precedents. These earlier forms include: field hollers, beat boxing, work song, Spoken Word, rapping, scatting, call and response, vocality (or special vocal effect: guttural effects, interpolated vocality, falsetto, melisma, vocal rhythmization), improvisation, blue notes, polyrhythms (syncopation, concrescence, tension, improvisation, percussion, swung note), texture (, homophony, polyphony, heterophony) and harmony (vernacular progressions; complex, multi-part harmony, as in spirituals, Doo Wop, and barbershop music).

American composer Olly Wilson outlines &quot;heterogeneous sound ideals&quot; that define traditional and common patterns in African Music, such as the use of timbre, pitch, volume and duration, and the incorporation of the body in making music. His findings include uses of call-and-response and the importance of interjections from the audience to express satisfaction or dissatisfaction. These heterogeneous sound ideals are also found in many other types of music.

White people sometimes taught black slaves to play Western instruments such as the fiddle and violin.

Due to the fact that white colonizers viewed indigenous African religious practices that included drumming and dancing as idolatrous, the enslaved individuals conducted their music-infused religious ceremonies in private. During the eighteenth century, the slaves&#x27; informal assemblies in praise houses and brush arbor meetings featured songs and chants such as the ring shout, a circular dance accompanied by chanting and handclapping. On occasion, the participants would enter into ecstatic trances.

African-American music is also influenced by European music and Native American music.

==History==
===18th century===
In the late 18th century folk spirituals originated among Southern slaves following their conversion to Christianity. Slaves reinterpreted the practice of Christianity in a way that had meaning to them as Africans in America. They often sang the spirituals in groups as they worked the plantation fields. African-American spirituals (Negro Spirituals) were created in invisible churches and regular Black churches. The hymns, melody, and rhythms were similar to songs heard in West Africa. Enslaved and free blacks created their own words and tunes. Themes include the hardships of slavery and the hope of freedom.

Spirituals from the era of slavery are called Slave Shout Songs. These shout songs are sung today by Gullah Geechee people and other African Americans in churches and praise houses. During slavery, these songs were coded messages that spoke of escape from slavery on the Underground Railroad and were sung by enslaved African Americans in plantation fields to send coded messages to other slaves, unbeknownst to the slaveholders. According to musicologist and historian Eric Sean Crawford who published &quot;Gullah Spirituals: The Sound of Freedom and Protest in the South Carolina Sea Islands&quot;, Gullah music influenced all genres of American music. Crawford said: &quot;All genres of music have been influenced by Gullah Geechee spirituals. This music&#x27;s bent notes, syncopated rhythms, and improvisational qualities heavily influenced gospel and country music. These musical traits found a secular home in the blues, jazz, and even later popular styles like hip hop&quot;. Scholar LeRhonda S. Manigault-Bryant explained Gullah spirituals are sacred music that connects Black Americans to ancestral spirits. She said: &quot;I am suggesting that low country sacred music simultaneously takes on a cyclical and linear quality, which is best exemplified in the use of the low country clap, and the repetition of verses that literally push a song forward to invoke The Spirit. The rhythmic practices and theological motifs of this music suspend and push time by connecting with past traditions, while denoting a spiritual bond that is simultaneously ancestral, communal, and divine&quot;. 

Slaves also used drums to communicate messages of escape. In West Africa, drums are used for communication, celebration, and spiritual ceremonies. West African people enslaved in the United States continued to make drums to send coded messages to other slaves across plantations. The making and use of drums by enslaved Africans was outlawed after the Stono Rebellion in South Carolina in 1739. Enslaved African Americans used drums to send coded messages to start slave revolts, and white slaveholders banned the creation and use of drums. After the banning of drums, slaves made rhythmic music by slapping their knees, thighs, arms and other body parts, a practice called pattin Juba. The Juba dance was originally brought by Kongo slaves to Charleston, South Carolina, and became an African-American plantation dance performed by slaves during gatherings when rhythm instruments were prohibited. 

Folk spirituals, unlike much white gospel, were often spirited. Slaves added dancing (later known as &quot;the shout&quot;) and other body movements to the singing. They also changed the melodies and rhythms of psalms and hymns, by speeding up the tempo, adding repeated refrains and choruses, and replacing texts with new ones that often combined English and African words and phrases. Originally passed down orally, folk spirituals have been central in the lives of African Americans for more than three centuries, serving religious, cultural, social, political, and historical functions.

Folk spirituals were spontaneously created and performed in a repetitive, improvised style. The most common song structures are the call-and-response (&quot;Blow, Gabriel&quot;) and repetitive choruses (&quot;He Rose from the Dead&quot;). The call-and-response is an alternating exchange between the soloist and the other singers. The soloist usually improvises a line to which the other singers respond, repeating the same phrase. Song interpretation incorporates the interjections of moans, cries, hollers, and changing vocal timbres, and can be accompanied by hand clapping and foot-stomping.

The Smithsonian Institution Folkways Recordings have samples of African American slave shout songs.

===19th century===

The influence of African Americans on mainstream American music began in the 19th century with the advent of blackface minstrelsy. The banjo, of African origin, became a popular instrument, and its African-derived rhythms were incorporated into popular songs by Stephen Foster and other songwriters. Over time the banjo&#x27;s construction adopted some European traditions such as a flat fingerboard. Some banjos had five strings, in contrast to the West African three-string version. This resulted in the creation of several different types of banjos in the United States.

In the 1830s, the Second Great Awakening led to a rise in Christian revivals, especially among African Americans. Drawing on traditional work songs, enslaved African Americans originated and performed a wide variety of spirituals and other Christian music. Some of these songs were coded messages of subversion against slaveholders, or signals to escape. For example, Harriet Tubman sang coded messages to her mother and other slaves in the field to let them know she was escaping on the Underground Railroad. Tubman sang: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m going to leave you, farewell, oh farewell; But I&#x27;ll meet you in the morning, farewell, oh farewell, I&#x27;ll meet you in the morning, I&#x27;m bound for the promised land, On the other side of Jordan, Bound for the Promised Land.&quot;

During the period after the Civil War, the spread of African-American music continued. The Fisk University Jubilee Singers first toured in 1871. Artists including Jack Delaney helped revolutionize post-war African-American music in the central-east of the United States. In the following years, professional &quot;jubilee&quot; troops formed and toured. The first black musical-comedy troupe, Hyers Sisters Comic Opera Co., was organized in 1876. In the last half of the 19th century, barbershops often served as community centers, where men would gather. Barbershop quartets originated with African-American men socializing in barbershops; they would harmonize while waiting their turn, singing spirituals, folk songs and popular songs. This generated a new style of unaccompanied four-part, close-harmony singing. Later, white minstrel singers stole the style, and in the early days of the recording industry their performances were recorded and sold. By the end of the 19th century, African-American music was an integral part of mainstream American culture.

===Early 20th century (1900s–1930s)===
In a groundbreaking moment in 1898, Broadway witnessed the debut of the first musical created by African Americans, courtesy of Bob Cole and Billy Johnson. The musical landscape saw another milestone in 1890 with the first recording by black musicians—Bert Williams and George Walker—highlighting music from Broadway productions. Theodore Drury played a pivotal role in nurturing black talent in opera, establishing the Drury Opera Company in 1900. Despite its short run until 1908, the company left an indelible mark as the pioneer in black participation within opera. Fast forward to 1911, where Scott Joplin&#x27;s trailblazing ragtime-folk opera, Treemonisha, took center stage, adding a unique and vibrant chapter to the history of African American contributions to the musical realm.

The early part of the 20th century saw a rise in popularity of blues and jazz. African-American music at this time was classed as &quot;race music&quot;. Ralph Peer, musical director at Okeh Records, put records made by &quot;foreign&quot; groups under that label. At the time &quot;race&quot; was a term commonly used by the African-American press to speak of the community as a whole with an empowering point of view, as a person of &quot;race&quot; was one involved in fighting for equal rights. Ragtime performers such as Scott Joplin became popular and some were associated with the Harlem Renaissance and early civil rights activists. White and Latino performers of African-American music were also visible. African-American music was often altered and diluted to be more palatable for white audiences, who would not have accepted black performers, leading to genres like swing music.

By the turn of the 20th century African Americans were becoming part of classical music as well. Originally excluded from major symphony orchestras, black musicians could study in music conservatories that had been founded in the 1860s, such as the Oberlin School of Music, National Conservatory of Music, and the New England Conservatory. Black people also formed symphony orchestras in major cities such as Chicago, New Orleans, and Philadelphia. Various black orchestras began to perform regularly in the late 1890s and the early 20th century. In 1906, the first incorporated black orchestra was established in Philadelphia. In the early 1910s, all-black music schools, such as the Music School Settlement for Colored and the Martin-Smith School of Music, were founded in New York.

The Music School Settlement for Colored became a sponsor of the Clef Club orchestra in New York. The Clef Club Symphony Orchestra attracted both black and white audiences to concerts at Carnegie Hall from 1912 to 1915. Conducted by James Reese Europe and William H. Tyers, the orchestra included banjos, mandolins, and baritone horns. Concerts featured music written by black composers, notably Harry T. Burleigh and Will Marion Cook. Other annual black concert series include the William Hackney&#x27;s &quot;All-Colored Composers&quot; concerts in Chicago and the Atlanta Colored Music Festivals.

The return of the black musical to Broadway occurred in 1921 with &quot;Sissle&quot; and Eubie Blake&#x27;s &quot;Shuffle Along&quot;. In 1927, a concert survey of black music was performed at Carnegie Hall including jazz, spirituals and the symphonic music of W. C. Handy&#x27;s Orchestra and the Jubilee Singers. The first major film musical with a black cast was King Vidor&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot; of 1929. African-American performers were featured in the musical &quot;Show Boat&quot; (which had a part written for Paul Robeson and a chorus of Jubilee Singers), and especially all-black operas such as &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; and Virgil Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot; of 1934.
From 1900 to 1930, Black American music underwent significant evolution, laying the foundation for many modern genres and profoundly shaping American culture. The early 1900s saw the rise of ragtime, characterized by its syncopated rhythms and popularized by artists like Scott Joplin. As the decade progressed, blues music emerged from the Deep South, with pioneers such as W.C. Handy, Ma Rainey, and Bessie Smith bringing the genre to a wider audience. The 1920s, known as the Jazz Age, witnessed the explosion of jazz, a genre that combined elements of blues, ragtime, and brass band music. Musicians like Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, and Duke Ellington became cultural icons, transforming jazz into a dominant artistic force through improvisation and swing.

This period also saw gospel music taking shape, influenced by the spirituals and hymns sung in Black churches. The Harlem Renaissance, a cultural and artistic movement centered in New York City, further propelled Black music into the mainstream, showcasing the talents of Black musicians and celebrating African American heritage. Despite systemic racism and limited opportunities, Black artists revolutionized the music industry. Their innovations during this era not only inspired the sounds of the 20th century but continue to resonate in music today, highlighting the resilience and creativity of the African American community.

The first symphony by a black composer to be performed by a major orchestra was William Grant Still&#x27;s &quot;Afro-American Symphony&quot; (1930) by the New York Philharmonic. Florence Beatrice Price&#x27;s Symphony in E minor was performed in 1933 by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In 1934, William Dawson&#x27;s &quot;Negro Folk Symphony&quot; was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra.

===Mid-20th century (1940s–1960s)===

&quot;Billboard&quot; started making a separate list of hit records for African-American music in October 1942 with the &quot;Harlem Hit Parade&quot;, which was changed in 1945 to &quot;Race Records&quot;, and then in 1949 to &quot;Rhythm and Blues Records&quot;.

By the 1940s, cover versions of African-American songs were commonplace, frequently topping the charts while the original versions did not reach the mainstream. In 1955, Thurman Ruth persuaded a gospel group to sing in the Apollo Theater. This presentation of gospel music in a secular setting was successful, and he arranged gospel caravans that traveled around the country playing venues that rhythm and blues singers had popularized. Meanwhile, jazz performers began to move away from swing towards music with more intricate arrangements, more improvisation, and technically challenging forms. This culminated in bebop, the modal jazz of Miles Davis, and the free jazz of Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane.

African-American musicians in the 1940s and 1950s were developing rhythm and blues into rock and roll, which featured a strong backbeat. Prominent exponents of this style included Louis Jordan and Wynonie Harris. Rock and roll music became commercially successful with recordings of white musicians, however, such as Bill Haley and Elvis Presley, playing a guitar-based fusion of black rock and roll and rockabilly. Rock music became more associated with white artists, although some black performers such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley had commercial success.

In 2017, National Public Radio wrote about the career of Sister Rosetta Tharpe and concluded with these comments: Tharpe &quot;was a gospel singer at heart who became a celebrity by forging a new path musically ... Through her unforgettable voice and gospel swing crossover style, Tharpe influenced a generation of musicians including Aretha Franklin, Chuck Berry and countless others ... She was, and is, an unmatched artist.&quot;

As the 1940s came to a close, other African Americans endeavored to concertize as classical musicians in an effort to transcend racial and nationalistic barriers in the post-war era. In 1968 Henry Lewis became the first African-American instrumentalist in a leading American symphony orchestra, an early &quot;musical ambassador&quot; in support of cultural diplomacy in Europe, and the first African-American conductor of a major American symphonic ensemble in 1968.

The term &quot;rock and roll&quot; had a strong sexual connotation in jump blues and R&amp;B, but when DJ Alan Freed referred to rock and roll on mainstream radio in the mid 50s, &quot;the sexual component had been dialed down enough that it simply became an acceptable term for dancing&quot;.

R&amp;B was a strong influence on rock and roll, according to many sources, including a 1985 article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; titled, &quot;Rock! It&#x27;s Still Rhythm and Blues&quot;. The author states that the &quot;two terms were used interchangeably&quot;, until about 1957.

Fats Domino was not convinced that there was any new genre. In 1957 he said: &quot;What they call rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll now is rhythm and blues. I&#x27;ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans&quot;. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;this is a valid statement ... all Fifties rockers, black and white, country born and city bred, were fundamentally influenced by R&amp;B, the black popular music of the late Forties and early Fifties&quot;. Elvis Presley&#x27;s recognition of the importance of artists such as Fats Domino was significant, according to a 2017 article: the &quot;championing of black musicians as part of a narrative that saw many positives in growing young white interest in African American-based musical styles&quot;. At a press event in 1969, Presley introduced Fats Domino, and said, &quot;that&#x27;s the real King of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; ... a huge influence on me when I started out&quot;.

By the mid-1950s, many R&amp;B songs were getting &quot;covered&quot; by white artists and the recordings got more airplay on the mainstream radio stations. For example, &quot;Presley quickly covered &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; ...So did Pat Boone&quot;, according to &quot;New Yorker&quot;. &quot;In 1956, seventy-six per cent of top R.&amp;.B. songs also made the pop chart; in 1957, eighty-seven per cent made the pop chart; in 1958, it was ninety-four per cent. The marginal market had become the main market, and the majors had got into the act.&quot;

The 1950s marked a significant uptick in the allure of blues, captivating audiences both in the US and across the pond in the UK, reminiscent of early 20th-century styles. Alongside this blues resurgence, Doo-wop center stage, enchanting listeners with its unique blend of vocal group harmonies, playful nonsense syllables, minimal instrumentation, and straightforward lyrics. Doo-wop, often featuring solo artists with backing groups, emphasized lead singers who played a prominent role in the musical arrangement. Simultaneously, a secularized version of American gospel music, known as soul ,emerged in the mid-1950s, led by trailblazers like Ray Charles, Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke. This soulful wave had a profound impact, influencing not only surf music but also paving the way for chart-topping girl groups like The Angels and The Shangri-Las. In a dance revolution, 1959 saw Hank Ballard releasing a song tailored for the new dance craze, &quot;The Twist&quot;, which would become a sensation defining the early &#x27;60s.

In 1959, Berry Gordy founded Motown Records, the first record label to primarily feature African-American artists, which aimed at achieving crossover success. The label developed an innovative, and commercially successful, style of soul music with distinctive pop elements. Its early roster included The Miracles, Martha and the Vandellas, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, and The Supremes. Black divas such as Aretha Franklin became &#x27;60s crossover stars. In the UK, British blues became a gradually mainstream phenomenon, returning to the United States in the form of the British Invasion, a group of bands led by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones who performed blues and R&amp;B-inspired pop with both traditional and modern aspects. WGIV in Charlotte, North Carolina, was one of a few radio stations dedicated to African-American music that started during this period.

The British Invasion knocked many black artists off the US pop charts, although some, like Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and a number of Motown artists, continued to do well. Soul music, however, remained popular among black people through new forms such as funk, developed out of the innovations of James Brown. In 1961, 11-year-old Stevland Hardaway Morris made his first record under Motown&#x27;s Tamla label as Stevie Wonder.

In 1964 the Civil Rights Act outlawed major forms of discrimination towards African Americans and women. As tensions began to diminish, more African-American musicians crossed over into the mainstream. Some artists who successfully crossed over were Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Ella Fitzgerald in the pop and jazz worlds, and Leontyne Price and Kathleen Battle in classical music.

By the end of the decade, black people were part of the psychedelia and early heavy metal trends, particularly by way of the ubiquitous Beatles&#x27; influence and the electric guitar innovations of Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix was among the first guitarists to use audio feedback, fuzz, and other effects pedals such as the wah wah pedal to create a unique guitar solo sound. Psychedelic soul, a mix of psychedelic rock and soul began to flourish with the 1960s culture. Even more popular among black people, and with more crossover appeal, was album-oriented soul in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which revolutionized African-American music. The genre&#x27;s intelligent and introspective lyrics, often with a socially aware tone, were created by artists such as Marvin Gaye in &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, and Stevie Wonder in &quot;Innervisions&quot;.

===1970s===
In the 1970s, album-oriented soul continued its popularity while musicians such as Smokey Robinson helped turn it into Quiet Storm music. Funk evolved into two strands, a pop-soul-jazz-bass fusion pioneered by Sly &amp; the Family Stone, and a more psychedelic fusion epitomized by George Clinton and his P-Funk ensemble. Disco evolved from black musicians creating soul music with an up-tempo melody. Isaac Hayes, Barry White, Donna Summer, and others helped popularize disco, which gained mainstream success.

Some African-American artists including The Jackson 5, Roberta Flack, Teddy Pendergrass, Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, The O&#x27;Jays, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire found crossover audiences, while white listeners preferred country rock, singer-songwriters, stadium rock, soft rock, glam rock, and, to some degree, heavy metal and punk rock.

During the 1970s, The Dozens, an urban African-American tradition of using playful rhyming ridicule, developed into street jive in the early &#x27;70s, which in turn inspired hip-hop by the late 1970s. Spoken-word artists such as The Watts Prophets, The Last Poets, Gil Scott-Heron and Melvin Van Peebles were some innovators of early hip-hop. Many youths in the Bronx used this medium to communicate the unfairness minorities faced at the time. DJs played records, typically funk, while MCs introduced tracks to the dancing audience. Over time, DJs began isolating and repeating the percussion breaks, producing a constant, eminently danceable beat, over which MCs began rapping, using rhyme and sustained lyrics. Hip-hop would become a multicultural movement in a youthful black America, led by artists such as Kurtis Blow and Run-DMC.

===1980s===

Michael Jackson had record-breaking success with his 1980s albums &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, &quot;Bad&quot;, and the best-selling album of all time, &quot;Thriller&quot;. Jackson paved the way for other successful crossover black solo artists such as Prince, Lionel Richie, Luther Vandross, Tina Turner, Whitney Houston, and Janet Jackson (Michael&#x27;s sister). Pop and dance-soul of this era inspired new jack swing by the end of the decade.

Hip-hop spread across the country and diversified. Techno, dance, Miami bass, post-disco, Chicago house, Los Angeles hardcore and Washington, D.C. Go-go developed during this period, with only Miami bass achieving mainstream success. Before long, Miami bass was relegated primarily to the Southeastern US, while Chicago house had made strong headway on college campuses and dance arenas (i.e. the warehouse sound, the rave). Washington&#x27;s Go-go garnered modest national attention with songs such as E.U.&#x27;s Da Butt (1988), but proved to be a mostly regional phenomena. Chicago house sound had expanded into the Detroit music environment and began using more electronic and industrial sounds, creating Detroit techno, acid, and jungle. The combination of these experimental, usually DJ-oriented, sounds with the multiethnic NYC disco sound from the 1970s and 1980s created a brand of music that was most appreciated in large discothèques in large cities. European audiences embraced this kind of electronic dance music with more enthusiasm than their North American counterparts.

From about 1986, rap entered the mainstream with Run-D.M.C.&#x27;s &quot;Raising Hell&quot;, and the Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;. &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; was the first rap album to enter the No.1 Spot on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and opened the door for white rappers. Both of these groups mixed rap and rock, appealing to both audiences. Hip-hop took off from its roots and the golden age hip hop flourished, with artists such as Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Public Enemy, LL Cool J, Queen Latifah, Big Daddy Kane, and Salt-N-Pepa. Hip-hop became popular in the United States and became a worldwide phenomenon in the late 1990s. The golden age scene would end by the early 1990s as gangsta rap and G-funk took over, with West Coast artists Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Warren G and Ice Cube, East Coast artists Notorious B.I.G., Wu-Tang Clan, and Mobb Deep, and the sounds of urban black male bravado, compassion, and social awareness.

While heavy metal music was almost exclusively created by white performers in the 1970s and 1980s, there were a few exceptions. In 1988, all-black heavy metal band Living Colour achieved mainstream success with their début album &quot;Vivid&quot;, peaking at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, thanks to their Top 20 single &quot;Cult of Personality&quot;. The band&#x27;s music contained lyrics that attack what they perceived as Eurocentrism and racism in America. A decade later, more black artists like Lenny Kravitz, Body Count, Ben Harper, and countless others would start playing rock again.

===1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and today===
Contemporary R&amp;B, the post-disco version of soul music, remained popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Male vocal groups such as The Temptations and The O&#x27;Jays were particularly popular, as well as New Edition, Boyz II Men, Jodeci, Dru Hill, Blackstreet, and Jagged Edge. Girl groups, including TLC, Destiny&#x27;s Child, SWV, and En Vogue were also highly successful.

Singer-songwriters such as R. Kelly, Mariah Carey, Montell Jordan, D&#x27;Angelo, Aaliyah, and Raphael Saadiq of Tony! Toni! Toné! were also popular during the 1990s. Mary J. Blige, Faith Evans, and BLACKstreet popularized a fusion blend known as hip-hop soul. The neo soul movement of the 1990s, with classic soul influences, was popularized in the late 1990s and early 2000s by such artists as D&#x27;Angelo, Erykah Badu, Maxwell, Lauryn Hill, India.Arie, Alicia Keys, Jill Scott, Angie Stone, Bilal, and Musiq Soulchild. A record review claimed that D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s critically acclaimed album &quot;Voodoo&quot; (2000) &quot;represents African American music at a crossroads ... To simply call [it] neo-classical soul ... would be [to] ignore the elements of vaudeville jazz, Memphis horns, ragtime blues, funk and bass grooves, not to mention hip-hop, that slips out of every pore of these haunted songs.&quot; Blue-eyed soul is soul music performed by white artists, including Michael McDonald, Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse, Robin Thicke, Michael Bolton, Jon B., Lisa Stansfield, Teena Marie, Justin Timberlake, Joss Stone, George Michael, and Anastacia. Blue-eyed soul, typically executed by Caucasian musicians, is known for its infectious hooks and melodies. It emerged from a blend of rockabilly influenced by white artists Elvis Presley and Bill Haley, as well as doo wop inspired by Dion and The Four Seasons. Notable artists in this genre include Righteous Brothers, Hall &amp; Oates, The Rascals, Mitch Ryder &amp; the Detroit Wheels, Dusty Springfield, Boy George, and George Michael. David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Young Americans&quot; album is considered a significant late contribution to blue-eyed soul.

Within underground circles, the Afro-punk movement garnered attention in the early 21st century, in large part due to the eponymous documentary released in 2003. This movement, including an annual festival has also contributed to bringing further light to the role of black people in punk rock since its origins in the 1970s.

Along with the singer-songwriter influence on hip-hop and R&amp;B, there was an increase in creativity and expression through Rap music. Tupac, The Notorious B.I.G. (&quot;Biggie&quot;), N.W.A, Lil&#x27; Kim, Snoop Dogg, and Nas broke into the music industry. &#x27;90s rap introduced many other subgenres including Gangsta rap, Conscious rap, and Pop rap. Gangsta rap focused on gang violence, drug dealing and poverty. It was also a major player in the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry. Main players in this rivalry were Tupac and Suge Knight on the West Coast and The Notorious B.I.G. and Diddy on the East Coast.

Hip-hop remains a genre created and dominated by African-Americans. In its early years the lyrics were about the hardships of being black in the United States. White-owned record labels controlled how hip-hop was marketed, resulting in changes to the lyrics and culture of hip-hop to suit white audiences. Scholars and African-American hip-hop creators noticed this change. Hip-hop is used to sell cars, cell phones, and other merchandise.
The hip-hop movement has become increasingly mainstream as the music industry has taken control of it. Essentially, &quot;from the moment &#x27;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&#x27; went platinum, hiphop the folk culture became hiphop the American entertainment-industry sideshow.&quot;

 In the early 2000s, 50 Cent was one of the most popular African-American artists. In 2005, his album &quot;The massacre&quot; sold over one million albums in its first week. In 2008, Lil Wayne&#x27;s album &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; also sold more than a million copies in its first week.

Within a year of Michael Jackson&#x27;s unexpected death in 2009, his estate generated $1.4 billion in revenues. A documentary containing rehearsal footage for Jackson&#x27;s scheduled &quot;This Is It&quot; tour, entitled &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s This Is It&quot;, was released on October 28, 2009, and became the highest-grossing concert film in history.

In 2013, no African-American musician had a &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one, the first year in which there was not a number-one record by an African-American in the chart&#x27;s 55-year history. J. Cole, Beyonce, Jay Z, and half-Canadian Drake, were all top-selling music artists this year, but none made it to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100&#x27;s number one, leading to much debate.

Black protest music went mainstream in the 2010s. Beyoncé, her sister Solange, Kanye West and Frank Ocean released black protest albums. Beyoncé released her first &quot;black protest&quot; album &quot;Lemonade&quot; in 2016. The album was dedicated to Black Lives Matter.

In 2020, Beyoncé released &quot;Black Parade&quot; during Juneteenth for George Floyd&#x27;s death. Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, The Game, Janelle Monae and D&#x27;Angelo and the Vanguard have also released music for Black Lives Matter.

== Cultural impact ==
Through the hybridization of African, European, and Native American cultural elements, African American music has made itself &quot;a distinctly American phenomenon&quot;.

=== Jim Crow &amp; Civil Rights Eras (early to mid 20th century) ===
The music made during the Jim Crow and Civil Rights era awakened &quot;the passion and purposefulness of the Southern Civil Rights Movement&quot; that &quot;provided a stirring musical accompaniment to the campaign for racial justice and equality&quot;. African-American men, women, and children from across the nation came together in social settings such as marches, mass meetings, churches, and even jails and &quot;conveyed the moral urgency of the freedom struggle&quot;. African-American music served to uplift the spirits and hearts of those fighting for civil rights. Guy Carawan referred to the Civil Rights Movement as &quot;the greatest singing movement this country has experienced&quot;.

==== &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; ====
Often called &quot;the anthem of the Civil Rights Movement&quot;, &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; was a hymn from the 19th-century that was used as a protest labor song in a labor strike against American Tobacco in Charleston, South Carolina in 1945–1946. It was overheard by Zilhpia Horton in a Tennessee tobacco field on a picket line in 1946, and a worker by the name of Lucille Simmons changed the original wording of &quot;I Will Overcome&quot; to &quot;We Will Overcome&quot;, which made it more powerful for the Civil Rights Movement.

In 1947, Horton added some verses to the song and taught Pete Seeger her version. Seeger revised the song from &quot;We will&quot; to &quot;We shall&quot;. In April 1960 at Raleigh, North Carolina, folk singer Guy Carawan sang the new version at the founding convention of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), starting its quick spread throughout the Civil Rights Movement. Seeger, Carawan, and Frank Hamilton copyrighted the song to prevent it from becoming a &quot;commercialized pop song&quot;.

&quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; continued to spread rapidly as the Civil Rights Movement gained supporters and momentum. Protestors across the nation sang the song as they marched for rights, were beat up, attacked by police dogs, and sent to jail for breaking segregation laws. &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; and many other protest songs during the Civil Rights movement became its soundtrack. Outside of the U.S., the song has been used in freedom movements around the world. In India, the song is known as &quot;Hum Honge Kaamyaab&quot;, which is a song that most school children in India know by heart.

=== Harlem Cultural Festival (1969) ===
The Harlem Cultural Festival was a series of music concerts held in Harlem&#x27;s Mount Morris Park in New York City. This festival &quot;celebrated African-American music and culture and promoted the continued politics of Black pride&quot;. At 3 pm on Sundays from June 29, 1969, to August 24, 1969, artists would perform to an audience of tens of thousands of people. Such artists that performed were Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, B.B. King, Sly and the Family Stone, The 5th Dimension, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, Mahalia Jackson, and many others.

==Economic impact==
Record stores played a vital role in African-American communities for many decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, between 500 and 1,000 black-owned record stores operated in the American South, and probably twice as many in the United States as a whole. According to &quot;The Political economy of Black Music&quot; By Norman Kelley, &quot;Black music exists in a neo-colonial relationship with the $12 billion music industry, which consist of six record companies.&quot; African-American entrepreneurs embraced record stores as key vehicles for economic empowerment and critical public spaces for black consumers at a time that many black-owned businesses were closing amid desegregation. Countless African Americans have worked as musical performers, club owners, radio deejays, concert promoters, and record label owners. Many companies use African-American music to sell their products. Companies like Coca-Cola, Nike, and Pepsi have used African-American music in advertising.

==International influence==
Jazz and hip-hop traveled to Africa and Asia and influenced other genres of African and Asian Music. Many state that without African-American music, there would be no American music. The songs that Africans brought to America created a foundation for American music. The textural styles, slang and African-American Vernacular English influenced American pop culture and global culture. The way African Americans dress in hip-hop videos and how African Americans talk is copied in the American market and the global market. White Australian rapper Iggy Azalea culturally appropriates black music and uses black speech in her music. White Canadian singer Justin Bieber has admitted to be influenced by black culture and black music.

===Afrobeat===
Afrobeat is a Nigerian music genre created by Nigerian artist Fela Kuti. Afrobeat began during the early twentieth century from Nigeria with a combination of Highlife, Yoruba music and jazz. The years between the wars (1918–1939) were a particularly fertile time for the formation of pan-West African urban musical traditions. Kuti fused traditional West African music with African-American music of Jazz, R&amp;B, and other genres of West African and African-American music. James Brown&#x27;s funk music, dance style, and African-American drumming influenced Afrobeat. In London, Kuti joined jazz and rock bands, and returned to Nigeria, creating Afrobeat by fusing African-American and traditional Yoruba music with Highlife music. In 1969, Kuti toured the United States and became inspired by the political activism of African Americans. He studied the life of Malcolm X and was inspired by his pro-black speeches. This resulted in a change in Kuti&#x27;s message as he began discussing the political issues in Africa and Nigeria. In contrast, &quot;Afrobeats&quot; is a term applied to a large range of genres popular all over Africa. Music referred to as Afrobeats, in contrast to Kuti, is frequently upbeat, digitally generated, and sung in English, West African, and pidgin languages. Kuti&#x27;s music was characterized by its political content and orchestral style whereas Afrobeats took influence from many musical themes found in R&amp;B and Hip-Hop/Rap (Love, sex, drugs, money, hard times, fame).

=== Racial appropriation and insensitivity in K-pop music ===
Hip-hop came to Korea in the 1990s and developed into Korean hip-hop and Korean K-pop music. Some Korean artists have appropriated African-American vernacular and other aspects of Black culture. Groups like the girl group Mamamoo have been known to dress in blackface, and others speak in &quot;blaccents&quot; and wear their hair in ethnic styles. Artist Zico has used the n-word in his music, and has claimed that he has a &quot;black soul.&quot; As of 2020, within &quot;K-pop, blackface, mouthing or saying racial slurs, and purely aesthetic uses of Black culture and hairstyles&quot; were still common, without necessarily understanding, honoring or crediting their African-American roots. According to sources cited in a 2020 Guardian article, many K-pop artists do not show support for African-American social justice issues. &quot;[M]any international fans are waiting for the industry to develop a more sensitive, globalized understanding of race.&quot; In Korean there are phrases that have been misconstrued to sound like the a racial slur. These include the phrase &quot;because of&quot; (니까), pronounced &#x27;nikka&#x27; and the word &quot;you&quot; or &quot;you&#x27;re&quot; (니가), pronounced &#x27;neega&#x27;.

<text>The term Greater Romania () usually refers to the borders of the Kingdom of Romania in the interwar period, achieved after the Great Union. It also refers to a pan-nationalist idea.

As a concept, its main goal is the creation of a nation-state which would incorporate all Romanian speakers. In 1920, after the incorporation of Transylvania, Bukovina, Bessarabia and parts of Banat, Crișana, and Maramureș, the Romanian state reached its largest peacetime geographical extent ever (295,049 km2). Today, the concept serves as a guiding principle for the unification of Moldova and Romania.

The idea is comparable to other similar conceptions such as the Greater Bulgaria, Megali Idea, Greater Yugoslavia, Greater Hungary and Greater Italy.

==Ideology==
The theme of national identity had been always a key concern for Romanian culture and politics. The Romanian national ideology in the first decades of the twentieth century was a typical example of ethnocentric nationalism. The concept of &quot;Greater Romania&quot; shows similarities to the idea of national state. The Romanian territorial claims were based on &quot;primordial racial modalities&quot;, the essential goal of them was to unify the biologically defined Romanians. The nation-building based on the French model of a unitary nation-state became an all time priority especially in the interwar and the Communist periods.

==Evolution==
===Before World War I===

The union of Michael the Brave, who ruled over the three principalities with Romanian population (Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia) for a short period of time, was viewed in later periods as the precursor of a modern Romania, a thesis which was argued by Nicolae Bălcescu. This theory became a point of reference for nationalists, as well as a catalyst for various Romanian forces to achieve a single Romanian state.

The Romanian revolution in 1848 already carried the seeds of the national dream of a unified and united Romania, though the &quot;idea of unification&quot; had been known from earlier works of Naum Ramniceanu (1802) and Ion Budai-Deleanu (1804). The concept owes its life to Dimitrie Brătianu, who introduced the term &quot;Greater Romania&quot; in 1852. The first step in unifying Romanians was to establish the United Principalities by uniting Moldavia and Wallachia in 1859, which became known as Romania since the 1866 Constitution and turned into a Kingdom in 1881, after gaining independence from the Ottoman Empire. However, before the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, the elite of the Transylvanian Romanians did not support the concept of &quot;Greater Romania&quot;, instead they wanted only equality with the other nations in Transylvania. The concept became a political reality when, in 1881, the Romanian National Party of Transylvania gathered Romanians on a common political platform to fight together for Transylvania&#x27;s autonomy. According to Livezeanu the creation of Greater Romania with &quot;a unifying concept of nationhood&quot; started to evolve in the late 1910s. World War I played a crucial part in the development of Romanian national consciousness.

===World War I===
The Treaty of Bucharest (1916) was signed between Romania and the Entente Powers on 4 (Old Style)/17 (New Style) August 1916 in Bucharest. The treaty stipulated the conditions under which Romania agreed to join the war on the side of the Entente, particularly territorial promises in Austria-Hungary. The signatories bound themselves to keep secret the contents of the treaty until a general peace was concluded.

Lucian Boia summarised the territorial extent of the nationalist dream as following:

:&quot;The phrase &quot;De la Nistru pana la Tisa&quot; (From Dniester to Tisza) is well known to Romanians, it defines the limits of an ideal Romania, though we should note that the Romanian population extends in the east beyond the Dniester, while both banks of the Tisza are completely Hungarian for most of the river&#x27;s length. To the south, the Danube completes the symbolic geography of Romania: an enclosed space between 3 rivers, with an area of 300.000 sq km, comparable to that of Italy or the British Isles. Rivers then are perceived as natural borders, separating Romanians from Others.&quot;

===Interwar Romania===

The concept of &quot;Greater Romania&quot; materialized as a geopolitical reality after the First World War. Romania gained control over Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transylvania. The borders established by the treaties concluding the war did not change until 1940. The resulting state, often referred to as &quot;România Mare&quot; or, alternatively, as (roughly translated in English as &quot;Romania Made Whole,&quot; or &quot;Entire Romania&quot;), was seen as the &#x27;true&#x27;, &quot;whole&quot; Romanian state, or, as Tom Gallagher states, the &quot;Holy Grail of Romanian nationalism&quot;. Its constitution, proclaimed in 1923, &quot;largely ignored the new ethnic and cultural realities&quot;.

The Romanian ideology changed due to the demographic, cultural and social alterations, however the nationalist desire for a homogeneous Romanian state conflicted with the multiethnic, multicultural truth of Greater Romania. The ideological rewriting of the role of &quot;spiritual victimization&quot;, turning it into &quot;spiritual police&quot;, was a radical and challenging task for the Romanian intellectuals because they had to entirely revise the national identity and the destiny of the Romanian nation. In accordance with this view, Livezeanu states that the Great Union created a &quot;deeply fragmented&quot; interwar Romania where the determination of national identity met with great difficulties mainly because of the effects of the hundred years of political separation. Due to the inability of the government to solve the problems of the Transylvanian Romanians&#x27; integration and the effects of the worldwide and national economic depression, &quot;the population gradually lost its faith in the democratic conception of Greater Romania&quot;.

The Great Depression in Romania, which started in 1929, destabilised the country. The early 1930s were marked by social unrest, high unemployment, and strikes. In several instances, the Romanian government violently repressed strikes and riots, notably the 1929 miners&#x27; strike in Valea Jiului and the strike in the Grivița railroad workshops. In the mid-1930s, the Romanian economy recovered and the industry grew significantly, although about 80% of Romanians were still employed in agriculture. French economic and political influence was predominant in the early 1920s but then Germany became more dominant, especially in the 1930s.

==== Territorial changes ====
=====Bessarabia=====
Bessarabia declared its sovereignty as the Moldavian Democratic Republic in 1917 by the newly formed &quot;Council of the Country&quot; (&quot;Sfatul Țării&quot;). The state was faced with the disorderly retreat through its territory of Russian troops from disbanded units. In January 1918, the &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot; called on Romanian troops to protect the province from the Bolsheviks who were spreading the Russian Revolution. After declaring independence from Russia on 24 January 1918, the &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot; voted for union with Romania on 9 April 1918. Of the 138 deputies in the council, 86 voted for union, 3 against, 36 abstained (mostly the deputies representing minorities, 52% of the population at the time) and 13 were not present. The United Kingdom, France, Italy and Japan recognized the incorporation of Bessarabia through the Treaty of Paris. The United States and the Soviet Union however refused to do so, the latter maintaining a claim to the territory for the whole interwar period. Furthermore, Japan failed to ratify the treaty, which therefore never entered into force.

=====Bukovina=====

In Bukovina, after being occupied by the Romanian Army, a National Council voted for union with Romania. While the Romanian, German, and Polish deputies unanimously voted for union, the Ukrainian deputies (representing 38% of the population according to the 1910 Austrian census) and Jewish deputies did not attend the council. The unification was ratified in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

=====Transylvania=====
On 1 December 1918, the Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia proclaimed the union of Transylvania and other territories with Romania in Alba Iulia, adopted by the Deputies of the Romanians of Transylvania, and supported one month later by the vote of the Deputies of the Saxons of Transylvania. The Hungarians of Transylvania, about 32% at the time (including the Hungarian-speaking Jewish community), and the Germans of Banat did not elect deputies upon the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, since they were considered represented by the Budapest government of Hungary, nevertheless on 22 December 1918 the Hungarian General Assembly in Cluj (Kolozsvár) reaffirmed the loyalty of Hungarians from Transylvania to Hungary. In the 1920 Treaty of Trianon, Hungary was forced to give up all claims over Transylvania and the treaty set the new borders between the two countries.

===World War II losses===
In 1940, the Romanian state agreed to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, as provided for by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Germany. It also lost Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa region, which were not mentioned in the pact, to the Soviet Union. It lost Northern Transylvania to Hungary, through the Second Vienna Award, and the Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria by the Treaty of Craiova. In the course of World War II, Romania, which was allied with the Axis Powers, not only re-annexed Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, but also took under administrative control lands to the east of Dniester (parts of recently formed Moldavian SSR, and of Odessa and Vinnytsia oblasts of Ukrainian SSR), creating Transnistria Governorate. Despite clear Ukrainian majority in the governorate&#x27;s ethnic composition, demonstrated by a census conducted in December 1941, Romanian government hoped to annex it eventually as a &quot;compensation&quot; for Northern Transylvania lost to Hungary.

These territories were lost again when the tide of the war turned. After the war, Romania regained the Transylvanian territories lost to Hungary, but not territory lost to Bulgaria or the Soviet Union. In 1948 a treaty between the Soviet Union and Soviet-occupied Communist Romania also provided for the transfer of four uninhabited islands to the Soviet Union, three in the Danube Delta and Snake Island in the Black Sea.

===After World War II===

After the war, the concept was interpreted as &quot;obsolete&quot; because of the Romanian defeat. However, even the Communist politicians between 1944 and 1947 plainly supported the re-establishment of Greater Romania. Gheorghe Apostol&#x27;s reminiscence strengthens the view for the nationalist argument of the Communists at the negotiations with Stalin about the future of Northern Transylvania. In contrast with this view, Romsics quotes Valter Roman, one of the heads of the Romanian Communist Party, as writing in his memo of April 1944: &quot;the two parts of Transylvania should be reunited as an independent state.&quot;

The Romanian Communist politicians&#x27; behavior were depicted as nationalist, and this circumstance brought about the concept of National Communism, which amalgamated elements of Stalinism and Fascism. According to Trond Gilberg the regime needed the strongly nationalist attitude because of the social, economic and political challenges. After the retreat of the Soviet troops from Romania in 1958, the national ideology was reborn, however it raises questions about its reconcilability with internationalist communism. Nicolae Ceaușescu fancied the idea that the creation of Greater Romania was the fruit of the end of the nation-formation process.

===Recent developments===
The fall of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and the economic downturn accompanying it led to a resurgence of nationalism in the region. Romania and Moldova, state comprising the bulk of Bessarabia which had become independent after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, confronted with their eastern neighbor, Ukraine. Bucharest and Chișinău announced territorial claims on Ukrainian lands (on parts of Chernivtsi and Odessa regions). Bulgaria surmised that the concept of Greater Romania stood behind Romanian foreign policy toward Moldova therefore expressed concerns about possible developments on Dobruja.

In 1992, the issue on unification of Moldova and Romania was negotiated between the Romanian and Moldovan governments and they wanted to achieve it by the end of the year. However, the &quot;unionists&quot; lost their dominance in Moldova in the middle of the year. Bucharest admitted the existence of the two Romanian states (Romania and Moldova) and defined priorities in reference to this matter: &quot;the creation of a common cultural space; the creation of an economically integrated zone; and gradual political integration&quot;. The Moldovan Snegur government became more pragmatic and realized that the nationalist propaganda from Bucharest did not help their aims especially on the problem of &quot;Soviet annexed Bessarabia&quot;. The Romanian organizations ignored the result of the Moldovan referendum on independence because the referendum did not ask Romanians in Romania. Romanian politicians blamed Russia and the Moldovan regime that unification became unreal. According to Edward Ozhiganov (Head of the Division for Ethnopolitical Research at the Analytical Center of the Federation Council in Russia), the armed conflict in Moldova was due to the Romanian ethnic nationalism, in other words, &quot;the attempt to create a unitary, ethnic state with power concentrated in the hands of ethnic nationalists in what was actually a multiethnic society.&quot; Furthermore, Bucharest&#x27;s behavior toward Ukraine did not change until 1997 when Romanian politicians realized that resolving border disputes was a precondition for NATO membership.

Present-day Romanian irredentists (such as members of PRM) aim to take possession of territories of northern Bukovina and Bessarabia. These regions currently belong to Ukraine and Moldova. The Russian presence and the tense political situation in Moldova also inflame their demands. Nevertheless, radicals make territorial demands on Hungary too. The Greater Romania Party (Partidul România Mare – PRM) is an emblematic representative of the aforesaid concept, though the conception is fostered also by other right-wing groups (e.g. the organisation of the New Right –Noua Dreaptă). Today, the phrase &quot;Bessarabia, Romanian land&quot; (, with several variations) is commonly used in Romania, and it poses territorial claims over the region of Bessarabia. It is also used in Moldova.

As of 2024 Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) supports the unification of Moldova and Romania. While S.O.S. Romania leader Diana Iovanovici Șoșoacă proposed a law in 2023 for a project on the Romanian Parliament for the annexation by Romania of Northern Bukovina, the Hertsa region, Budjak, Northern Maramureș and Snake Island from Ukraine, as they were &quot;historical territories&quot; that belong to Romania as stated in the law project. In retaliation, Ukraine announced it would impose sanctions against Iovanovici Șoșoacă, labeling her as a threat to Ukrainian national security.

<text>Ardfert () is a village and civil parish in County Kerry, Ireland. Historically a religious centre, the economy of the locality is driven by agriculture and its position as a dormitory town, being only from Tralee. The population of the village was 749 at the 2016 census.

==Origin==
The village&#x27;s name signifies, according to Sir James Ware, &quot;a wonderful place on an eminence&quot;, or as some interpret it, &quot;the hill of miracles.&quot; Ardfert has also been considered a corruption of Ard Ert, &quot;the high place of Ert or Erc&quot;, so called after the fifth century Irish Bishop Saint Erc, who made the place a bishop&#x27;s seat. Ardfert was written by the Four Masters as &quot;Ard-ferta&quot;, the height of the grave.

==History==
Ardfert is a parish in the Barony of Clanmaurice, County Kerry, Ireland, anciently in the territory of Ui Fearba/Hy Ferba, of which the O&#x27;Laeghain (O&#x27;Leyne, Leen or Lane) were once the Gaelic Lords, until Norman invasion of Ireland. 

Ardfert is the home of St. Brendan&#x27;s Ardfert Cathedral, which was destroyed in the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and the birthplace of St. Brendan the Navigator, who was educated about the year 500 AD. He founded a monastery there in the sixth century, but both town and monastery were destroyed by fire in 1089, and again in 1151.

The Norman influence can still be seen not only in the architecture, but also in local family surnames such as the Cantillons (Barons de Ballyheigue), and Fitzmaurices, and in place names, such as Ballintobeenig, a nearby townland below Mt. Crusline called after St. Aubin. Thomas FitzMaurice, 1st Baron Kerry founded a Franciscan friary there in 1253, and Nicholas, the 2nd Lord Kerry, built a leper house there in 1312. It was the seat of a bishopric until 1660.

The Crusader Knights Hospitaller of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem (later known as Knights of Malta), also had some rights in Ardfert, although there is a record of a dispute between them and the Franciscans in 1325 about the market cross and pillory. They had already been established in the area in c. 1200 when Meiler FitzHenry, grandson of King Henry I of England, and Justiciar of Ireland under King John, established a preceptory at Rattoo under a Fra&#x27; William from Dublin. Under the terms of a royal grant in letters patent of James I of England on 6 July 1612, the Lord of Kerry (FitzMaurice) could hold courts baron and leet.

The Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland, recount how in 1601, Prince Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell, on his way to the Battle of Kinsale, sent some of his kinsmen troops there to reconquer Ardfert, Lixnaw, and Ballykeally for his ally FitzMaurice. En route, he visited and venerated a relic of the True Cross (Holy rood) on the Feast of St. Andrew, on 30 November 1601, at Holy Cross Abbey, near Thurles, County Tipperary, which was a rallying point for the defence of religious freedom and for Irish sovereignty. From there he sent an expedition to Ardfert, to win a quick victory and recover the territory of his ally, Fitzmaurice, Lord of Kerry, who had lost it and his 9-year-old son, to Sir Charles Wilmot. The expedition captured Caislean Gearr (Short Castle, of which no trace remains), adjacent to the Cathedral in Ardfert. An O&#x27;Donnell from Tyrconnell remained behind in stewardship to hold it, according to &quot;The Life of Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell, Prince of Tyrconnell&quot;written by Lughaidh O&#x27;Cléirigh, circa 1603 in Gaelic.
A large tomb in the grounds of the cathedral was built much later by John O&#x27;Donnell (1803–1879), the most prominent descendant two centuries later, and whose own direct male descendant was the late Patrick Denis O&#x27;Donnell (1922–2005), the Irish military historian. He owned the summit overlooking Ardfert (Mt. Crusline, Ballintobeenig, from where his ancestral O&#x27;Donnell of Tyrconnell, under authority of Prince Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell would have launched the battle to regain Ardfert for Lord Kerry in 1601). The family seat of John O&#x27;Donnell, at Tubrid mentioned by Samuel Lewis in his 1837 &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot;, passed through a female line to the O&#x27;Carrolls. The house expanded by John O&#x27;Donnell in Tubridmore was listed as an intended &quot;protected structure&quot; in the archaeological monuments section of the draft Kerry County Development Plan 2015–2021.

In the early 19th century, the Earl of Listowel (Hare) was Lord of the Manor and held court every three weeks in Ardfert, through an appointed Seneschal, having bought those rights from the Earl of Kerry, Fitzmaurice.
The area&#x27;s archaeological heritage includes the medieval cathedral, St. Brendan&#x27;s, and associated churches, Temple na Hoe (Church of the young Virgin) and Temple na Griffin. Several have these have become heritage tourism attractions in the Kerry area due to their central location. The 13th century Franciscan Friary, to the north east of the village, was once an integral part of Ardfert Abbey - not an abbey at all but the name of the Talbot-Crosbie mansion destroyed by fire in 1922 by the IRA.

Five other structures included on the Record of Protected Structures (RPS) are located in Ardfert; St Brendan&#x27;s Catholic Church (consecrated in 1855), the Old Gates of the Earl of Glandore&#x27;s Demesne, the Talbot-Crosbie Memorial, the Ardfert Parish Room (now a site registered as derelict by Kerry County Council) and Brandon House. There are also many other structures within the village which are not included in the RPS, but are considered to be of considerable architectural and heritage value, such as the Ardfert Retreat Center. Also nearby are the surviving estate walls which contribute to the character and identity of the village.

==Geography and development==
From the 17th century (possibly 1639) until 1800 the area was a borough constituency. The borough corporation (its local council) elected two members of the Irish House of Commons. The borough was disenfranchised by the Act of Union 1800, and from 1801 the area was represented as part of the county constituency of Kerry. Ardfert lost borough status under section 13 of the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. It was one of fifty-eight borough corporations dissolved on 25 October 1840. At this time, about a half-mile east of the cathedral, Ardfert Abbey was the home of the Crosbies, Baron Brandon, and contained the ruins of the old Franciscan Abbey. They also maintained a well-stocked deer-park and gardens.

In the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 census of Ireland, the population of Ardfert village increased from 648 to 749 inhabitants.

It is located within an agricultural area, surrounded by flat and low-lying land. The main Tralee-Ballyheigue road bisects the village in an east–west axis, with road width restrictions on the western side of the village. To the north of the village, the Tyshe River traverses the village road network. The village settlement pattern is radial and dispersed and consists of a mixture of single site depth development along radial roads interspersed with housing estates. Within the core of the village there is a mix of dwelling types of various traditional designs. More modern design predominates in the one-off housing on the radial routes. The development of a central retail and social node has been constrained to some extent by need to protect historic buildings and monuments within the village.

==Economy and amenities==
The village provides a number of goods and services to the local area and surrounding agricultural hinterland. Other developments have increased its role as a dormitory suburb for Tralee. The village also acts as a convenience stop for tourist and local through traffic. The village is served by social and retail services, including a Garda station, &quot;An Post&quot; post office, health centre, garage, petrol station and a number of retail outlets and public houses. In addition there is a Roman Catholic Church, a school and a community centre with gym and launderette. Planning permission for residential development has recently been permitted on the existing Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) grounds, with replacement facilities planned elsewhere on the periphery of the village.

==Transport==
Ardfert is located on the R551 regional road from Tralee to Ballyheigue. The village centre is located at a crossroads between the R551 and several local roads. The traffic is increased by the quarry to the north east of the village which generates HGV traffic movements through the village. During the summer months, the situation is exacerbated by tourist traffic to coastal locations. The Tralee-Ballyheigue road at the northern end of the village sees bottleneck delays in traffic into and out of the village.

Ardfert railway station, on the line from Limerick to Tralee via Newcastle West, opened on 20 December 1880. The station closed to passengers on 4 February 1963, and to freight on 2 June 1978. The track was lifted in 1988.

==Sport==
===Gaelic games===

Ardfert GAA, the local Gaelic football club, won the All-Ireland Junior Club Football Championship in Croke Park on 19 February 2006 beating Loughrea of Galway. The club&#x27;s accomplishments also include winning the 2007 All-Ireland Intermediate Club Football Championship, defeating Derry and Ulster Champions Eoghan Rua, on 10 March 2007 again in Croke Park.

The local hurling club is St Brendan&#x27;s, Ardfert. They have won the Kerry Senior Hurling Championship on 8 occasions, most recently in 2013.

===Other sports===
A short lived greyhound racing track was opened in the village on 21 August 1929. The venture run by the Kingdom Greyhound Racing Club and only lasted until Wednesday 25 September 1929. The last race was the Ardfert Stake which was won by Captain Off, the even money favourite. The main reason for the closure was the fact that a larger track called Oakview Park (to the south in Oakview Village) was due to open.

The eventing horse &quot;Village Gossip&quot;, ridden between 1976 and 1985 by British team rider Lucinda Green (née Prior Palmer), was born and bred in Ardfert. He completed Badminton Horse Trials on several occasions, placing second in 1978 and was the fastest competitor at the World Three Day Event in Lexington, Kentucky, the same year.

<text>The Church of God (Charleston, Tennessee) or TCOG is a Holiness Pentecostal denomination of Christianity. It is based in the United States. The church&#x27;s actual name is The Church of God; however, the parenthetical phrase &quot;Charleston, Tennessee&quot; is added to distinguish it from similar-sounding organizations. The Church of God was organized in 1993 after a schism in the Church of God of Prophecy. Its headquarters is in Cleveland, Tennessee but its postal address is in Charleston, Tennessee. As of 2007, The Church of God operates in 48 countries and territories.

==History==

===Origins===

In August 1886, Richard Spurling (1810–1891), an ordained Baptist minister, became dissatisfied with what he believed were overly creedal approaches to New Testament Christianity. Spurling collaborated with seven members from Missionary Baptist churches in Monroe County, Tennessee and Cherokee County, North Carolina. In 1903, these small fellowships organized the Christian Union with the stated intent to unite on the principles of the New Testament without reference to restatements of the faith in creedal form.

Ultimately, the Christian Union under leadership of Spurling&#x27;s son Richard Spurling Jr, and others including a former Quaker and Bible salesman named Ambrose Jessup Tomlinson, experienced remarkable growth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the Appalachian foothills. By 1907, Tomlinson had become the acknowledged leader of these Christian believers whose faith was driven by Wesleyan beliefs of personal holiness and reported Pentecostal experiences of being filled with the Holy Spirit and glossolalia. Many small congregations were planted and organized under the common name adopted in 1907, &quot;Church of God&quot;. In 1909, Tomlinson was elected General Overseer of the fledgling church. He held that position until 1923.

Contrary to its desire to be free from creedal restatements of faith, this body was soon disrupted by competing restatements of biblical teachings from within its own ranks. An ensuing division in 1923 resulted in two primary splinter groups, called respectively &quot;Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)&quot; and the &quot;Church of God over which A.J. Tomlinson is General Overseer&quot;. The latter, led by Tomlinson, was court-ordered in 1951 to assume the name Church of God of Prophecy which is still in use. A. J. Tomlinson&#x27;s son, Milton Ambrose Tomlinson, succeeded him as General Overseer in 1943, and served until age-related disability prompted his retirement in 1990.

===Reorganization===
Upon the election of M. A. Tomlinson&#x27;s successor that year, yet another schism occurred. One group within the Church of God of Prophecy, declared that the selection process was a departure from what had historically been perceived as &quot;theocratic government&quot; within the body&#x27;s governing structure and procedure.

In 1993, this group which at the time referred to themselves as &quot;The Concerned&quot; called for a &quot;solemn assembly&quot;, borrowing an Old Testament term for corporate devotion to prayer to rhetorically emphasize its earnestness. The &quot;solemn assembly&quot; resulted in the formation of The Church of God. The church places particular emphasis upon the word &quot;The&quot; in its title as a statement of this reorganization, believing it is the singular exclusive embodiment of the New Testament Christian church. Robert J. Pruitt was chosen to be the new overseer, and he remained so until 2006, when age-related disability prompted his retirement.

A meeting of TCOG&#x27;s leadership during the summer of 2006 ended with the selection of Stephen Smith as the interim General Overseer to replace Pruitt. During the TCOG General Assembly of 2006, Smith was confirmed as the General Overseer. A faction within the church disagreed with how Smith was selected, and his rank of Bishop. As a result, this group withdrew and formed The Church of God under the leadership of Bishop James C. Nabors.

In June 2015, Smith died, leaving the office of General Overseer vacant. A meeting of the presbytery unanimously chose Bishop Oscar Pimentel to serve as the Interim General Overseer until a more permanent selection could be made at the annual Genera Assembly. In August, during the annual General Assembly, Pimentel was accepted unanimously by the membership present to serve in the office of General Overseer.

==Beliefs==
The Church of God is a Pentecostal church in the Wesleyan Holiness tradition. It believes that one is saved or born again as a result of repentance, justification and regeneration. After one is saved, a second work of grace (sanctification) makes living a holy life possible along with the doctrine of Christian perfectionism. The church is opposed to the use of tobacco, alcohol and drugs; opposed to membership in secret societies; opposed to wearing jewelry and other ornamentation; and against divorce and remarriage. It also condemns the swearing of oaths. The church believes it is possible to lose salvation, or fall from divine grace, if one goes back into sin.

The Church of God believes all the gifts of the Spirit are in operation in the church and that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. TCOG holds the following three ordinances: water baptism by immersion, the Lord&#x27;s Supper reserved for sinless and consecrated Christians, and feet washing. Tithing is also practiced. This body is premillennial in eschatology.

It believes the observance of Sabbath was a requirement of Jewish law and as such was not carried over into the Grace Dispensation. Sunday is not Christian Sabbath but is merely a day set aside to give special attention to the worship of God. Instead of keeping only Sabbath holy, we are required in this dispensation to keep every day holy. Jewish &quot;Shabbat&quot; is a type of Christ, who is our rest, rather than the day.

An important belief which distinguishes it from many other Holiness-Pentecostal churches is its belief that it is the true church. It believes the Christian Church was established before Pentecost around A.D. 28 and was plunged into apostasy in A.D. 325. TCOG holds that the true church was restored in North Carolina on June 13, 1903, and that this restoration is a fulfilment of the Isaiah 60:1-5 prophecy. The Church of God experienced disruptions in 1923 and 1993 but, according to the TCOG, it is the true church of God.

<doc id="392828" wikidata="Q428867" url="?curid=392828" title="Abundance of the chemical elements">
<text>The abundance of the chemical elements is a measure of the occurrences of the chemical elements relative to all other elements in a given environment. Abundance is measured in one of three ways: by &quot;mass fraction&quot; (in commercial contexts often called &quot;weight fraction&quot;), by &quot;mole fraction&quot; (fraction of atoms by numerical count, or sometimes fraction of molecules in gases), or by &quot;volume fraction&quot;. Volume fraction is a common abundance measure in mixed gases such as planetary atmospheres, and is similar in value to molecular mole fraction for gas mixtures at relatively low densities and pressures, and ideal gas mixtures. Most abundance values in this article are given as mass fractions.

The abundance of chemical elements in the universe is dominated by the large amounts of hydrogen and helium which were produced during Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Remaining elements, making up only about 2% of the universe, were largely produced by supernova nucleosynthesis. Elements with even atomic numbers are generally more common than their neighbors in the periodic table, due to their favorable energetics of formation, described by the Oddo–Harkins rule.

The abundance of elements in the Sun and outer planets is similar to that in the universe. Due to solar heating, the elements of Earth and the inner rocky planets of the Solar System have undergone an additional depletion of volatile hydrogen, helium, neon, nitrogen, and carbon (which volatilizes as methane). The crust, mantle, and core of the Earth show evidence of chemical segregation plus some sequestration by density. Lighter silicates of aluminium are found in the crust, with more magnesium silicate in the mantle, while metallic iron and nickel compose the core. The abundance of elements in specialized environments, such as atmospheres, oceans, or the human body, are primarily a product of chemical interactions with the medium in which they reside.

== Abundance values ==
Abundance of each element is expressed as a relative number. Astronomy uses a logarithmic scale for abundance formula_1 of element X relative to Hydrogen, defined by
formula_2
for number density formula_3; formula_4 on this scale. Another scale is mass fraction or, equivalently, percent by mass.

For example, the abundance of oxygen in pure water can be measured in two ways: the &quot;mass fraction&quot; is about 89%, because that is the fraction of water&#x27;s mass which is oxygen. However, the &quot;mole fraction&quot; is about 33% because only 1 atom of 3 in water, H2O, is oxygen. As another example, looking at the &quot;mass fraction&quot; abundance of hydrogen and helium in both the universe as a whole and in the atmospheres of gas-giant planets such as Jupiter, it is 74% for hydrogen and 23–25% for helium; while the &quot;(atomic) mole fraction&quot; for hydrogen is 92%, and for helium is 8%, in these environments. Changing the given environment to Jupiter&#x27;s outer atmosphere, where hydrogen is diatomic while helium is not, changes the &quot;molecular&quot; mole fraction (fraction of total gas molecules), as well as the fraction of atmosphere by volume, of hydrogen to about 86%, and of helium to 13%. Below Jupiter&#x27;s outer atmosphere, volume fractions are significantly different from mole fractions due to high temperatures (ionization and disproportionation) and high density, where the ideal gas law is inapplicable.

== Universe ==

The abundance of chemical elements in the universe is dominated by the large amounts of hydrogen and helium which were produced during Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Remaining elements, making up only about 2% of the universe, were largely produced by supernovae and certain red giant stars. Lithium, beryllium, and boron, despite their low atomic number, are rare because, although they are produced by nuclear fusion, they are destroyed by other reactions in the stars. Their natural occurrence is the result of cosmic ray spallation of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in a type of nuclear fission reaction. The elements from carbon to iron are relatively more abundant in the universe because of the ease of making them in supernova nucleosynthesis. Elements of higher atomic numbers than iron (element 26) become progressively rarer in the universe, because they increasingly absorb stellar energy in their production. Also, elements with even atomic numbers are generally more common than their neighbors in the periodic table, due to favorable energetics of formation (see Oddo–Harkins rule), and among the lightest nuclides helium through sulfur the most abundant isotopes of equal number of protons and neutrons.

Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe; helium is second. All others are orders of magnitude less common. After this, the rank of abundance does not continue to correspond to the atomic number. Oxygen has abundance rank 3, but atomic number 8. 
There are 80 known stable elements, and the lightest 16 comprise 99.9% of the ordinary matter of the universe. These same 16 elements, hydrogen through sulfur, fall on the initial linear portion of the table of nuclides (also called &quot;the&quot; &quot;Segrè plot&quot;), a plot of the proton versus neutron numbers of all matter both ordinary and exotic, containing hundreds of stable isotopes and thousands more that are unstable. The Segrè plot is initially linear because (aside from hydrogen) the vast majority of ordinary matter (99.4% in the Solar System) contains an equal number of protons and neutrons (Z=N).

The abundance of the lightest elements is well predicted by the standard cosmological model, since they were mostly produced shortly (i.e., within a few hundred seconds) after the Big Bang, in a process known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Heavier elements were mostly produced much later, in stellar nucleosynthesis.

Hydrogen and helium are estimated to make up roughly 74% and 24% of all baryonic matter in the universe respectively. Despite comprising only a very small fraction of the universe, the remaining &quot;heavy elements&quot; can greatly influence astronomical phenomena. Only about 2% (by mass) of the Milky Way galaxy&#x27;s disk is composed of heavy elements.

These other elements are generated by stellar processes. In astronomy, a &quot;metal&quot; is any element other than hydrogen or helium. This distinction is significant because hydrogen and helium are the only elements that were produced in significant quantities in the Big Bang. Thus, the metallicity of a galaxy or other object is an indication of stellar activity after the Big Bang.

In general, elements up to iron are made by large stars in the process of becoming supernovae, or by smaller stars in the process of dying. Iron-56 is particularly common, since it is the most stable nuclide (in that it has the highest nuclear binding energy per nucleon) and can easily be &quot;built up&quot; from alpha particles (being a product of decay of radioactive nickel-56, ultimately made from 14 helium nuclei). Elements heavier than iron are made in energy-absorbing processes in large stars, and their abundance in the universe (and on Earth) generally decreases with increasing atomic number.

The table shows the ten most common elements in our galaxy (estimated spectroscopically), as measured in parts per million, by mass.
Nearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The more distant galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past, so their abundances of elements appear closer to the primordial mixture. Since physical laws and processes are apparently uniform throughout the universe, however, it is expected that these galaxies will likewise have evolved similar abundances of elements.

As shown in the periodic table, the abundance of elements is in keeping with their origin. Very abundant hydrogen and helium are products of the Big Bang. The next three elements in the periodic table (lithium, beryllium, and boron) are rare, despite their low atomic number. They had little time to form in the Big Bang. They are produced in small quantities by nuclear fusion in dying stars or by breakup of heavier elements in interstellar dust, caused by cosmic ray spallation. In supernova stars, they are produced by nuclear fusion, but then destroyed by other reactions.
Heavier elements, beginning with carbon, have been produced in dying or supernova stars by buildup from alpha particles (helium nuclei), contributing to an alternatingly larger abundance of elements with even atomic numbers (these are also more stable). The effect of odd-numbered chemical elements generally being more rare in the universe was empirically noticed in 1914, and is known as the Oddo–Harkins rule.

The following graph (log scale) shows abundance of elements in the Solar System.


===Relation to nuclear binding energy===
Loose correlations have been observed between estimated elemental abundances in the universe and the nuclear binding energy curve (also called the &quot;binding energy per nucleon&quot;). Roughly speaking, the relative stability of various atomic nuclides in withstanding the extremely energetic conditions of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) has exerted a strong influence on the relative abundance of elements formed in the Big Bang, and during the development of the universe thereafter.
See the article about nucleosynthesis for an explanation of how certain nuclear fusion processes in stars (such as carbon burning, etc.) create the elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.

A further observed peculiarity is the jagged alternation between relative abundance and scarcity of adjacent atomic numbers in the estimated abundances of the chemical elements in which the relative abundance of even atomic numbers is roughly 2 orders of magnitude greater than the relative abundance of odd atomic numbers (Oddo–Harkins rule). A similar alternation between even and odd atomic numbers can be observed in the nuclear binding energy curve in the neighborhood of carbon and oxygen, but here the loose correlation between relative abundance and binding energy ends. The binding energy for beryllium (an even atomic number), for example, is &quot;less&quot; than the binding energy for boron (an odd atomic number), as illustrated in the nuclear binding energy curve. Additionally, the alternation in the nuclear binding energy between even and odd atomic numbers resolves above oxygen as the graph increases steadily up to its peak at iron. The semi-empirical mass formula (SEMF), also called &quot;Weizsäcker&#x27;s formula&quot; or the &quot;Bethe-Weizsäcker mass formula&quot;, gives a theoretical explanation of the overall shape of the curve of nuclear binding energy.

== Sun ==
Modern astronomy relies on understanding the abundance of elements in the Sun as part of cosmological models. Abundance values are difficult to obtain: even photospheric or observational abundances depend upon models of solar atmospherics and radiation coupling. These astronomical abundance values are reported as logarithms of the ratio with hydrogen. Hydrogen is set to an abundance of 12 on this scale.

The Sun&#x27;s photosphere consists mostly of hydrogen and helium; the helium abundance varies between about 10.3 and 10.5 depending on the phase of the solar cycle; carbon is 8.47, neon is 8.29, oxygen is 7.69 and iron is estimated at 7.62.

== Earth ==

The Earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the Solar System. In turn, the history of Earth led to parts of the planet having differing concentrations of the elements.

The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.97 kg. By mass, it is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements.

The bulk composition of the Earth by elemental mass is roughly similar to the gross composition of the solar system, with the major differences being that Earth is missing a great deal of the volatile elements hydrogen, helium, neon, and nitrogen, as well as carbon which has been lost as volatile hydrocarbons.

The remaining elemental composition is roughly typical of the &quot;rocky&quot; inner planets, which formed &quot;inside&quot; the &quot;frost line&quot; close to the Sun, where the young Sun&#x27;s heat and stellar wind drove off volatile compounds into space.

The Earth retains oxygen as the second-largest component of its mass (and largest atomic fraction), mainly due to oxygen&#x27;s high reactivity; this caused it to bond into silicate minerals which have a high melting point and low vapor pressure.
=== Crust ===


The mass-abundance of the nine most abundant elements in the Earth&#x27;s crust is roughly: oxygen 46%, silicon 28%, aluminium 8.3%, iron 5.6%, calcium 4.2%, sodium 2.5%, magnesium 2.4%, potassium 2.0%, and titanium 0.61%. Other elements occur at less than 0.15%. For a full list, see abundance of elements in Earth&#x27;s crust.

The graph at right illustrates the relative atomic-abundance of the chemical elements in Earth&#x27;s upper continental crust—the part that is relatively accessible for measurements and estimation.

Many of the elements shown in the graph are classified into (partially overlapping) categories:

# rock-forming elements (major elements in green field, and minor elements in light green field);
# rare earth elements (lanthanides (La–Lu), Sc, and Y; labeled in blue);
# major industrial metals (global production &gt;~3×10 kg/year; labeled in red);
# precious metals (labeled in purple);
# the nine rarest &quot;metals&quot; – the six platinum group elements plus Au, Re, and Te (a metalloid) – in the yellow field. These are rare in the crust from being soluble in iron and thus concentrated in Earth&#x27;s core. Tellurium is the single most depleted element in the silicate Earth relative to cosmic abundance, because in addition to being concentrated as dense chalcogenides in the core it was severely depleted by preaccretional sorting in the nebula as volatile hydrogen telluride.

There are two breaks where the unstable elements technetium (atomic number 43) and promethium (number 61) would be. These elements are surrounded by stable elements, yet their most stable isotopes have relatively short half lives (~4 million years and ~18 years respectively). These are thus extremely rare, since any primordial amounts of these elements have long since decayed. These two elements are now only produced naturally through spontaneous fission of very heavy radioactive elements (such as uranium, thorium, or the trace amounts of plutonium that exist in uranium ores), or by the interaction of certain other elements with cosmic rays. Both technetium and promethium have been identified spectroscopically in the atmospheres of stars, where they are produced by ongoing nucleosynthetic processes.

There are also breaks in the abundance graph where the six noble gases would be, since they are not chemically bound in the Earth&#x27;s crust, and so their crustal abundance is not well-defined.

The eight naturally occurring very rare, highly radioactive elements (polonium, astatine, francium, radium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, and plutonium) are not included, since any of these elements that were present at the formation of the Earth have decayed eons ago, and their quantity today is negligible and is only produced from radioactive decay of uranium and thorium.

Oxygen and silicon are the most common elements in the crust. On Earth and rocky planets in general, silicon and oxygen are far more common than their cosmic abundance. The reason is that they combine with each other to form silicate minerals. Other cosmically common elements such as hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen form volatile compounds such as ammonia and methane that easily boil away into space from the heat of planetary formation and/or the Sun&#x27;s light.

==== Rare-earth elements ====
&quot;Rare&quot; earth elements is a historical misnomer. The persistence of the term reflects unfamiliarity rather than true rarity. The more abundant rare earth elements are similarly concentrated in the crust compared to commonplace industrial metals such as chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, or lead. The two least abundant stable rare earth elements (thulium and lutetium) are nearly 200 times more common than gold. However, in contrast to the ordinary base and precious metals, rare earth elements have very little tendency to become concentrated in exploitable ore deposits. Consequently, most of the world&#x27;s supply of rare earth elements comes from only a handful of sources. Furthermore, the rare earth metals are all quite chemically similar to each other, and they are thus quite difficult to separate into quantities of the pure elements.

Differences in abundances of individual rare earth elements in the upper continental crust of the Earth represent the superposition of two effects, one nuclear and one geochemical. First, the rare earth elements with even atomic numbers (58Ce, 60Nd, ...) have greater cosmic and terrestrial abundances than the adjacent rare earth elements with odd atomic numbers (57La, 59Pr, ...). Second, the lighter rare earth elements are more incompatible (because they have larger ionic radii) and therefore more strongly concentrated in the continental crust than the heavier rare earth elements. In most rare earth ore deposits, the first four rare earth elements – lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium – constitute 80% to 99% of the total amount of rare earth metal that can be found in the ore.
=== Mantle ===
The mass-abundance of the seven most abundant elements in the Earth&#x27;s mantle is approximately: oxygen 44.3%, magnesium 22.3%, silicon 21.3%, iron 6.32%, calcium 2.48%, aluminium 2.29%, nickel 0.19%.

=== Core ===
Due to mass segregation, the core of the Earth is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.

=== Ocean ===

The most abundant elements in the ocean by proportion of mass in percent are oxygen (85.84%), hydrogen (10.82%), chlorine (1.94%), sodium (1.08%), magnesium (0.13%), sulfur (0.09%), calcium (0.04%), potassium (0.04%), bromine (0.007%), carbon (0.003%), and boron (0.0004%).

=== Atmosphere ===
The order of elements by volume fraction (which is approximately molecular mole fraction) in the atmosphere is nitrogen (78.1%), oxygen (20.9%), argon (0.96%), followed by (in uncertain order) carbon and hydrogen because water vapor and carbon dioxide, which represent most of these two elements in the air, are variable components. Sulfur, phosphorus, and all other elements are present in significantly lower proportions.

According to the abundance curve graph, argon, a significant if not major component of the atmosphere, does not appear in the crust at all. This is because the atmosphere has a far smaller mass than the crust, so argon remaining in the crust contributes little to mass fraction there, while at the same time buildup of argon in the atmosphere has become large enough to be significant. 
=== Urban soils ===
&quot;For a complete list of the abundance of elements in urban soils, see Abundances of the elements (data page)#Urban soils.&quot;
== Human body ==

By mass, human cells consist of 65–90% water (H2O), and a significant portion of the remainder is composed of carbon-containing organic molecules. Oxygen therefore contributes a majority of a human body&#x27;s mass, followed by carbon. Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: hydrogen (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P) . The next 0.75% is made up of the next five elements: potassium (K), sulfur (S), chlorine (Cl), sodium (Na), and magnesium (Mg). Only 17 elements are known for certain to be necessary to human life, with one additional element (fluorine) thought to be helpful for tooth enamel strength. A few more trace elements may play some role in the health of mammals. Boron and silicon are notably necessary for plants but have uncertain roles in animals. The elements aluminium and silicon, although very common in the earth&#x27;s crust, are conspicuously rare in the human body.

<doc id="392831" wikidata="Q4354" url="?curid=392831" title="Hinterland">
<text>Hinterland is a German word meaning the &#x27;land behind&#x27; a city, a port, or similar. Its use in English was first documented by the geographer George Chisholm in his &quot;Handbook of Commercial Geography&quot; (1888). Originally the term was associated with the area of a port in which materials for export and import are stored and shipped. Subsequently, the use of the word expanded to include any area under the influence of a particular human settlement.

== Geographic region ==
* An area behind a coast or the shoreline of a river. Specifically, by the &quot;doctrine of the hinterland,&quot; the hinterland is the inland region lying behind a port and is claimed by the state that owns the coast.
* In shipping usage, a port&#x27;s hinterland is the area that it serves, both for imports and for exports.
* The term is also used to refer to the area around a city or town.
* More generally, &quot;hinterland&quot; can refer to the rural area economically tied to an urban catchment area. The size of a hinterland can depend on geography, or on the ease, speed, and cost of transportation between the catchment area and the hinterland.
* In colonial usage, the term was applied to the surrounding areas of former European colonies in Africa, which, although not part of the colony itself, were influenced by the colony. By analogous general economic usage, hinterland can refer to the area surrounding a service from which customers are attracted, also called the market area.
* In German, &quot;Hinterland&quot; is sometimes used more generally to describe any sparsely populated area where the infrastructure is underdeveloped, although &quot;Provinz&quot; (analogous to &quot;province&quot;) is more common. In the United States, and particularly in the American Midwest (a region of German cultural heritage located far from ocean ports), it is this meaning and not the one relating to ports that predominates in common use. Analogous terms include &quot;the countryside&quot;, &quot;the sticks&quot;, &quot;the boonies&quot;, &quot;backcountry&quot;, &quot;boondocks&quot;, the Bush (in Alaskan usage), the outback (Australia), and the &quot;sertão&quot; (Brazil).
* In Germany a local area in the western part of the &quot;Kurfürstentum Hessen&quot; (Electorate of Hesse) is named &quot;Hessisches Hinterland&quot; (short: &quot;Hinterland&quot;, Hessian Hinterland) without being the local backcountry to a larger city. Cities there are Battenberg, Biedenkopf and Gladenbach. The name &quot;Hinterland&quot; was in use over many ecenturies, and nowadays means a smaller area. Lesser known, similar names are given to other areas in Germany (and Switzerland).
* In Italy, &quot;hinterland&quot; is used to describe the metropolitan area of a city, especially Milan, outside of the main municipality.

== Breadth of knowledge ==
A further sense in which the term is commonly applied, especially by British politicians, is in talking about an individual&#x27;s depth and breadth of knowledge (or lack thereof), of matters outside politics, specifically of academic, artistic, cultural, literary and scientific pursuits. For instance, one could say, &quot;X has a vast hinterland&quot;, or &quot;Y has no hinterland&quot;. The spread of this usage is usually credited to Denis Healey (British Defence Secretary 1964–1970, Chancellor of the Exchequer 1974–1979) and his wife Edna Healey, initially in the context of the lack of hinterland—i.e., interests outside of politics—of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

<doc id="392839" wikidata="Q1229557" url="?curid=392839" title="Distributed coordination function">
<text>Distributed coordination function (DCF) is the fundamental medium access control (MAC) technique of the IEEE 802.11-based WLAN standard (including Wi-Fi). DCF employs a carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) with the binary exponential backoff algorithm.

DCF requires a station wishing to transmit to listen for the channel status for a DIFS interval. If the channel is found busy during the DIFS interval, the station defers its transmission. In a network where a number of stations contend for the wireless medium, if multiple stations sense the channel busy and defer their access, they will also virtually simultaneously find that the channel is released and then try to seize the channel. As a result, collisions may occur. In order to avoid such collisions, DCF also specifies random backoff, which forces a station to defer its access to the channel for an extra period. The length of the backoff period is determined by the following equation:

formula_1

A few features about DCF:

* has an optional virtual carrier sense mechanism that exchanges short Request-to-send (RTS) and Clear-to-send (CTS) frames between source and destination stations during the intervals between the data frame transmissions;
* includes a positive acknowledge scheme, which means that if a frame is successfully received by the destination it is addressed to, the destination needs to send an ACK frame to notify the source of the successful reception;
* it does not solve the hidden node and/or exposed terminal problem completely, it only alleviates the problem through the use of RTS and CTS, and recommends the use of a larger carrier sensing range;
* it is defined in the IEEE 802.11 standard and is the de facto default setting for Wi-Fi hardware.

802.11 DCF consumes a significant amount of airtime, 802.11 control messages usually convey very little information. For example, an ACK message can take up to 60 μs to transmit completely, which includes an amount of airtime sufficient to transmit 3240 bits at 54 Mbit/s, during which it conveys a single bit of relevant information.

The IEEE 802.11 standard also defines an optional access method using a point coordination function (PCF). PCF allows the access point acting as the network coordinator to manage channel access. The IEEE 802.11e amendment to the standard enhances the DCF and the PCF, through a new coordination function called Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF).

<doc id="392845" wikidata="Q2564277" url="?curid=392845" title="West Island">
<text>The West Island (, ) is the unofficial name given to the city, towns and boroughs at the western end of the Island of Montreal, in Quebec, Canada. It is generally considered to consist of the Lakeshore municipalities of Lachine (specifically the Western Lachine area, also known as Dixie and later Summerlea), Dorval, Pointe-Claire, and Beaconsfield, the municipalities of Kirkland, Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Baie-D&#x27;Urfé, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, the village of Senneville, and two North Shore boroughs of the city of Montreal: Pierrefonds-Roxboro and L&#x27;Île-Bizard–Sainte-Geneviève.

Historically, there was a linguistic division of the island of Montreal into French and English &#x27;halves&#x27;, with Francophones typically inhabiting the eastern portion of the island and Anglophones typically inhabiting the western half. The West Island&#x27;s population is approximately 238,000 and although the overwhelming majority of its residents are today bilingual if not multi-lingual (given the cosmopolitan nature of this vast suburban area), anglophones still make up a plurality of the West Island&#x27;s population. As late as the 1960s, much of the West Island was farmland populated by French Canadians, which in turn accounts for a significant Francophone cultural influence in the region.

The region is home to the Montréal–Trudeau International Airport, John Abbott College, Cégep Gérald-Godin, the Macdonald Campus of McGill University, the Fairview Pointe-Claire and Galeries des Sources malls, as well as Montreal&#x27;s largest park, the Cap-Saint-Jacques Nature Park. Hospitals include the Veteran&#x27;s Hospital in Sainte-Anne&#x27;s and the Lakeshore General Hospital in Pointe-Claire. Municipalities range in character from the modern bedroom communities of Kirkland or Dollard-des-Ormeaux to the former cottage-country homes of Dorval, Pointe Claire and Beaconsfield. Development and the concentration of industrial activity along highways 20, 40 and 13 over the last twenty years has made securing the region&#x27;s remaining tracts of open land a priority for many West Island residents. The West Island is home to one of the last large remaining tracts of Montreal-region wilderness on island.

==History==

===Pre-contact, colonial and agricultural eras===
The history of human settlement in the West Island of Montréal likely predated European colonization which began in the early to mid 17th century, but little is known of the history of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians who inhabited the island in the pre-colonial era. Indeed, between Cartier&#x27;s first contact in 1535–1536 and the arrival of Champlain in 1608, the local Iroquoians had completely disappeared, most probably from near-constant warfare with other neighbouring Iroquois tribes, particularly the Mohawk. The West Island may have had areas of regular human habitation as the history of human settlement in Montreal goes back at least as far as 8,000 years.

European colonization led to the establishment of parishes and small trading outposts along a Chemin du Roy laid out in the 17th century that corresponds more or less directly with the Gouin &amp; Lakeshore boulevards of today. Lachine, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Sainte-Genevieve and Pointe-Claire developed in a more or less interconnected fashion as colonial outposts spread out along the edge of the island. During the Ancien Régime of the early colonial era, these communities had their own parish churches, many of which still exist. In addition to the churches and rectories, religious orders of various types had set up monasteries and convents, novitiates and the like throughout the West Island, given its proximity to Ville-Marie. Seigneurial system land divisions and the development of the &#x27;montée &amp; rang&#x27; main road system allowed for the development of a vast agricultural territory, protected by forts, seigneurial manor houses and the geographic advantages of being on a densely forested island. Though much of the West Island is today a vast low-density modern suburban development, most of the principal roads were developed in the 17th and 18th centuries, inasmuch as land division follows examples common to the Ancien Régime. Moreover, the West Island has a small number of critical 18th century heritage properties, in addition to parish churches, summer villas, windmills and the remnants of Fort Senneville, constituting the principle remnants from the early and middle colonial period in this area. Other important heritage properties include the numerous 19th century summer homes, farm houses and the turn of the century villages in Pointe-Claire, Saint-Anne&#x27;s or Sainte-Genevieve. A key element of local architecture, as noted by author-historian Jean-Claude Marsan, is that the Habitant house-style of the 17th century proved so reliable, affordable and aesthetically pleasing it was repeated well into the 20th century with few major structural modifications. Houses of this kind can be found throughout the region.

Two seigneuries were founded on land that is now part of the West Island:
* 1678, Seigneurie de l&#x27;Île-Bizard (b)
* 1636, Seigneurie de l&#x27;Île-de-Montréal (c)

This led to the creation of the first three parishes:
* 1703, Sainte-Anne-du-Bout-de-l&#x27;Île
* 1713, Saint-Joachim-de-la-Pointe-Claire
* 1741, Sainte-Geneviève-de-Pierrefonds

In 1672, the seigneurie de l&#x27;Île-Perrot was founded, which is now part of the Off-Island region.

Key early settlements leading up to the major post-war suburban developments include:

Dorval, founded between 1665–1667 as a Sulpician mission, became a village in 1892, a town in 1903 and a city in 1956. Its development came largely in 1855 when the Grand Trunk Railroad established a station at Dorval, leading the hamlet to develop into a summer retreat for wealthy early-Victorian Era Montreal elites. Later, through the start of the century until the Second World War, the village became a town well known for its beaches on Lake Saint-Louis.
Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, first explored and settled between 1663 and 1712, though widely used by Iroquois and Algonquins for hundreds if not thousands of years before contact, due to its strategic importance at the confluence of the Ottawa and Saint Lawrence rivers and at the western tip of the Island of Montreal. A mission was established at the present site of the Baie-D&#x27;Urfé Yacht Club in 1663, while Fort Senneville was developed beginning in 1671. A post office was established in 1835 while the Saint Anne Canal was established in 1843. Train service on the Grand Trunk began in 1854, and the village was first incorporated a year later. Though the village had been principally oriented on parish activities and agriculture throughout the 19th century, the early 20th century saw the development of Macdonald College in 1907, the creation of Gardenvale and the Harpell/Garden City Print Company, an important industrial cooperative, in addition to the Veterans Hospital in 1917.

===Early 21st century: merger and demerger===
As part of the 2002–2006 municipal reorganization of Montreal, all individual cities on the Island of Montreal, including those in the West Island, were merged into the expanded city of Montreal on January 1, 2002. However, following a change of government and a 2004 referendum, the residents of most West Island cities voted for demerger, and were re-constituted effective January 1, 2006. However, they remained part of a new supra-municipal structure: the urban agglomeration of Montreal. Pierrefonds, Roxboro, Sainte-Geneviève and Île-Bizard remained in Montreal, as the boroughs of Pierrefonds-Roxboro and L&#x27;Île-Bizard–Sainte-Geneviève, respectively.

One argument for amalgamation was that West Islanders enjoyed lower taxes than the old city of Montreal, but still used its theatres, concert halls, and museums. With amalgamation, tax rates were harmonized across the island. In fact, the West Island contains several wealthy neighbourhoods, parks and historical sites.

When referring to the towns that touch Lake Saint-Louis, such as Dorval, Pointe-Claire and Beaconsfield, many people called the area the Lakeshore. Whereas in reference to towns that touch Lake of Two Mountains and Rivière-des-Prairies, such as Pierrefonds, Sainte-Geneviève and Roxboro, they called the area the North Shore.
==Housing and infrastructure==
The West Island has a cosmopolitan feel and at times an eclectic design (with modern buildings and classic Québécois country homes side by side). The region boasts large green spaces bordering rivers and lakes, bike trails, nature parks, museums, cross-country ski trails, ecological farms, golf courses and cultural sites. As a testimony to its 300-year-old history, residents and visitors alike will discover 18th-century buildings along the former Chemin du Roy, today Gouin Boulevard and Chemin du Bord-du-Lac, in addition to the remnants of Fort Senneville. The shores of Lake Saint-Louis offer a unique setting with café-terrasses, restaurants and boutiques filled with quaint Old World charm. The area today is largely middle and upper-middle class residential zoning along with the strip-malls and other services one might expect in a North American mega-suburb. Large tracts were developed in the period between 1955–1975 (such as Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Pierrefonds, Roxboro and Kirkland) where the majority of homes are similarly-sized variations of the basic bungalow design, though with traditional Québécois architectural influences. Lots tend to be more or less even in size without much variation across entire cities or boroughs. As such, the West Island tends to give the impression of being a somewhat homogeneous construction.

==Nature==

The environment and climate of the West Island is almost identical to that of Montreal, and is affected by the same ecological conditions, namely, it is a large open plain of wide plateaus and marshland. The West Island is surrounded by the other islands in the Hochelaga Archipelago as well as Lake of Two Mountains and Lac Saint-Louis and their inter-connected rivers and creeks. The territory was largely agricultural from the 17th century until the middle of the 20th century, when it was then quickly developed into a sprawling network of bedroom suburbs. The West Island has numerous large tracts of uncultivated land, some of which are protected parks while in other cases they&#x27;re merely the fallow fields of former farms, waiting to be sold to residential property developers. Other portions of land have been designated for the construction of a highway to connect the 40 with the 440, through Kirkland, Pierrefonds, Île Bizard and Laval, but the plan has gone nowhere. A significant portion of the Northwestern corner of the West Island is so sparsely developed it constitutes the last portion of Montreal&#x27;s pre-settlement ecosystem. Though agriculture on the island is limited to the Macdonald Experimental Farm, the remnants of farmland in Senneville and Pierrefonds are likely to be developed into low-density residential housing. Conserving the remaining segments of local island wilderness has become a focal point of West Island politics over the course of the last thirty years, and is a point of common concern.

===Flora and fauna===

Due to the primarily residential character of the West Island and the influence of the City Beautiful and Garden City movements in residential urban-planning in older suburbs on island, the West Island is primarily composed of single-family dwellings on spacious lots organized along small winding roads leading away from large thoroughfares. The area is notable for its many parks and a general emphasis on retaining as much of the rustic, rural charm that characterized the region and led to its development as a popular summer retreat in the early part of the 20th century.

Due to these and other traits, a wide variety of flora and fauna common to the Saint Lawrence river valley can be found in a somewhat balanced natural ecosystem in the largely undeveloped Northwestern corner of the West Island, in addition to the developed low-density residential areas. Flora and fauna found in the West Island fall within the broader spectrum of the Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests ecoregion. Of note is the presence of non-native, borderline hardiness trees, such as the tulip tree, which thrive in small section of Senneville near the Île aux Tourtes Bridge.

Mammalian species that inhabit the greater West Island region include white-tailed deer, coyote and cottontail rabbits. The current population of white-tailed deer is substantial, estimated at over a thousand. It is not uncommon for moose to occasionally cross the ice onto the island in winter. Other species endemic to the western portion of the island include grey squirrels, red squirrels, flying squirrels, mink, chipmunks, raccoons, beaver, skunks, porcupines, martens, woodchucks, muskrat, otters, and fox. The number of bird species varies according to season and migration. During spring and fall many species pass through the area on their way to southern breeding grounds. During winter months, depending on climatic conditions and availability of food in the northern Quebec, many species of birds will take up temporary residence, such as great grey owls, snow buntings, snowy owls, and others. The West Island has enough variation in suitable habitats, such as marsh, ponds, forest and field that many species of birds nest here. Various species of reptiles which can be found include garter snakes, red bellied, brown, milk and the northern water snake. Species of turtles include painted, map and snapping turtle. Amphibians include bullfrogs, green frogs, leopard frogs, spring peepers, wood frogs, and others. Salamanders such as the eastern newt, red backed salamander, blue spotted salamander are also found in the more humid habitats. In the surrounding waters of the west island, notably the Lake Saint-Louis side, large fish species such as northern pike, sturgeon, garfish, carp, catfish, muskellunge can be found. Given the Saint Lawrence&#x27;s heavy traffic and years of misuse, the ecoregion is negatively effected by high pollution which in turn has resulted in diminished local populations of native fauna. That said, residential development in the greater West Island suburban region (including the Vaudreuil-Soulanges area and parts of Eastern Ontario), has resulted in occasional sightings of black bears, wolves, lynx and cougars (which are generally believed to be extinct though sightings and some physical evidence suggest otherwise) as they themselves are pushed out of their habitats.

===Nature parks===

The Morgan Arboretum in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue is 610 acres of protected urban forest with over 180 bird species, of which about one-hundred breed within the park. It is also home to the Ecomuseum Zoo, which features a collection of species native to the Saint Lawrence River valley.

Cap Saint Jacques is Montreal&#x27;s largest park at 711 acres of protected forest, featuring 30 km of cross-country trails, a beach and a small organic farm.

There are also the L&#x27;Anse-à-l&#x27;Orme Nature Park, Angell Woods, Terra Cotta Park, Centennial Park, the Rapides du Cheval Blanc linear park, and the Bois-de-Liesse Nature Park. These constitute the major forested areas in the West Island, with remaining community green spaces typically designed in conventional park layout. Other principal large open green spaces include Macdonald Experimental Farm and remaining tracts of open land around the Morgan Arboretum in Senneville and western Pierrefonds.

==Municipalities and boroughs==
The West Island is an informal term for a large territory of low-density middle and upper-middle class housing, low and medium density commercial sectors and vast industrial operations roughly constituting the western third of the Island of Montreal. As such there are no precise boundaries, but rather a fundamentally similar cultural and societal identity. The West Island is not a city, but rather a collection of independent cities, towns and villages in addition to several boroughs of the City of Montreal that share an intimate relationship and identity with the citizens of Montreal, and yet have also developed a unique common identity and strong sense of local character. Again, for this reason it is difficult to say exactly which communities constitute the West Island, though it is largely understood to mean all communities, independent or otherwise, developed on the island of Montreal West of Highway 13 and 32nd Avenue.
The West Island generally consists of the following towns, cities and boroughs:

*Baie-D&#x27;Urfé – a primarily residential town of 3,900 people notable for a more rural charm, established in 1910. Served by 5 bus lines and a train station.
*Beaconsfield – a small residential city of 19,000 people served by 8 bus lines and 2 train stations, also established in 1910.
*Dollard-des-Ormeaux – a city of about 49,000 residents with large residential, commercial and industrial sectors, established in 1924. It is the West Island&#x27;s most populous city outside of the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough of the City of Montreal.
*Dorval – a city of 18,000 initially founded in 1667 and developed initially as a summer retreat for urban dwellers. Today it is largely industrial.
*Kirkland – a city of 20,000 largely developed in the 1970s and 1980s with a sizeable industrial sector.
*Pointe Claire – a city of 30,000 initially founded in 1698 as an important outpost along the fur-trade routes. Pointe Claire has several significant historic sites.
*Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue – an exceptionally unique &#x27;college-town&#x27; of 5,200 initially founded as a parish in 1703, and home to several key West island institutions, including the last fully operational farm on the Island of Montreal, Canada&#x27;s only national veterans hospital and the second largest English language college in Quebec.
*Senneville – a village of almost 1,000 residents initially founded in 1679 and the former site of the Colonial French Fort Senneville. Senneville has a peculiar local microclimate which allows non-native &#x27;borderline hardiness&#x27; plant species to thrive.

These independent communities constitute the de-merged West island municipalities. In addition, there are two City of Montreal boroughs:

*L&#x27;Île-Bizard–Sainte-Geneviève – with a population of 17,500 people, traces its roots back to the fur trade, and features a large nature park, a public college and an old parish church.
*Pierrefonds-Roxboro – the largest West Island community, with a population in excess of 60,000 almost perfectly divided along linguistic lines and featuring the largest nature park on the island, in addition to many small businesses and over 24,000 private dwellings. This borough is served by two stations along the Deux-Montagnes Line of the Agence Métropolitain de Transport, in addition to regular express bus service to and from the City of Montreal throughout the day. This borough is particularly notable for the large number of primary and secondary schools, religious and community centres, playgrounds, sports facilities and other green spaces evenly distributed throughout the territory.

In addition to the areas listed above, the western communities located in the Vaudreuil-Soulanges Regional County Municipality, are part of what is known as the Off-Island area, which is sometimes considered as an extension of the West Island:
*Vaudreuil-Dorion
*Hudson
*Saint-Lazare 
*the four communities of Île Perrot

==Demographics==

Population

===Language spoken at home===
From the Canada 2006 Census:
The West Island is home to Quebec&#x27;s largest concentration of native English-speakers, most of whom are bilingual. Includes West Island municipalities only, not West-Island boroughs of Montreal. The West Island can also claim to have the highest demographic concentration of German Canadians in the province of Quebec. With an even higher concentration located in the Town of Baie-D&#x27;Urfé, where the German language school, The Alexander von Humboldt Schule Montréal – German International School is located.

==Education==

Post-secondary institutions

The Macdonald Campus of McGill University, which traces its roots back to 1905, when Macdonald College was originally constructed as an agricultural college. The buildings which currently house John Abbott College are those of the original Macdonald College, which in 1972 became a satellite campus of McGill University and moved into newer buildings east of the original site. The Macdonald Campus supports McGill&#x27;s Morgan Arboretum, the J. S. Marshall Radar Observatory and the last operational farm on the Island of Montreal, in addition to the .

John Abbott College was opened in the old Macdonald College buildings located in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue in 1971 and has since become one of the largest CEGEPs in Quebec, with well-over 7,000 students. The campus was initially split between two sites until the construction of the Casgrain Centre in 1981, and a new science and technology pavilion is currently being completed along with campus-wide renovations and upgrades. The site features the nearly completely abandoned Brittain Hall, the former men&#x27;s dormitory. In this respect, Brittain Hall is a near identical copy of Stewart Hall (the original women&#x27;s dorm), and features the same stacked &#x27;gym-cafeteria-pool&#x27; layout, along with massive fireplaces and other features of an Edwardian-era rural college dormitory. Today it is still owned by McGill University and is almost exclusively used for film and television production. Despite a rapid increase in school population and the subsequent lack of space, there are no plans to renovate or rehabilitate Brittain Hall at the moment. Another feature of the campus is the location of steam pipes and access tunnels located directly under the sidewalks, so as to permit natural snow-removal. Moreover, there are a series of tunnels connecting all buildings on campus, designed so as to facilitate moving about the sprawling campus. A portion of the system connecting Stewart to Brittain Hall, has been closed since the 1970s and remains largely inaccessible.

Cégep Gérald-Godin was opened in a former novitiate of the Fathers of the Holy Cross in 1999 and is a prominent West Island post-modern architectural achievement. It features the Salle Pauline-Julien a performing arts venue, and is home to roughly 1,200 students. It is so far the only uniquely Francophone CEGEP in the West Island. The development of the CEGEP has had a positive impact on the development of the village of Sainte-Geneviève as a smaller primarily Francophone equivalent to Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue.

Public primary and secondary

English-language instruction in the West island is provided primarily by the Lester B. Pearson School Board while French-language instruction is provided by the Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys. The LBPSB counts some 28,000 students in 12 high schools, 40 elementary schools, 2 adult education centres and 4 vocational schools. The CSMB counts some 45,000 students across a larger territory principally focused on the western portion of the island, with 61 elementary schools, 12 high schools, 2 specialized schools, 6 vocational schools and 4 adult-education centres.

Important West Island public high schools include, but are not limited to:

* Beaconsfield High School – founded in Beaconsfield in 1958, 1130 students.
* John Rennie High School – founded in Pointe Claire in 1955 it boasts the Sports-Etudes program for student athletes as well as a highly regarded local theatre and dramatic arts program.
* Lindsay Place High School – founded in Pointe-Claire in 1962 with 1,600 students, one of the largest in the West Island.
* Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School – founded in 1971 in Pierrefonds to support Catholic francophone and anglophone students, it is an architecturally significant school given its open concept design along an axial core, not to mention industrial visual cues, such as exposed concrete walls and overhead pipes, small windows and rooms without doors. Roughly 1200 students attend PCHS, which is co-located with the LBPSB administered West Island Career Centre (WICC). PCHS offers an international baccalaureate program and shares its grounds with the George Springate community sports complex.
* Riverdale High School – once one of the largest schools in the West Island (approximately 2,600 students in the early 1970s until the early 1980s), Riverdale&#x27;s population has declined significantly in the last thirty years, but it still remains a special place in the community of Pierrefonds. An adult education centre now occupies most of the first floor.
* Saint Thomas High School – public high schools in the West Island, St. Thomas is consistently ranked in the top-ten of Quebec&#x27;s schools. It offers an IB program and is home to some 1,300 students.

==Media==
The West Island is served by several weekly newspapers including the English-language &quot;The Suburban&quot;, &quot;West Island Gazette&quot; and &quot;Montreal Times&quot; as well as &quot;Cités Nouvelles&quot;, published in French (and formerly published in bilingual format as &quot;Cités Nouvelles-City News&quot; up until 2010).

&quot;The North Shore News&quot; once served the communities of Pierrefonds, Roxboro &amp; Dollard des Ormeaux when those communities were primarily focused along access routes to and from Gouin and Sources Boulevards and the Sunnybrook and Roxboro train stations. Though the publication was touted as the West Island&#x27;s only independent weekly throughout the 1960s and 1970s, it died out in the 1980s. Another longtime publication was the English language &quot;The Chronicle&quot;, which began in 1925 and ended in 2015.

A local radio station CFOX broadcast from Pointe Claire at 1470 kHz in the AM broadcast band from 1960–1989. It offered several different program formats including country as well as top-40 music before its sale to the CKO all-news network. Declining revenue led the station&#x27;s closure in 1989.

==Sports and recreation==

The West Island boasts multiple public and private sports and recreation facilities, many of which are co-located at local secondary schools or gathered around municipal buildings. As with many suburban areas, residents have access to numerous community pools, parks, greens and playgrounds, in addition to soccer and football fields, rugby pitches and baseball diamonds. All West Island residents have access to amateur sports clubs and associations, and minor-level hockey, soccer, basketball and football are all quite popular. Moreover, various leagues and associations are generally very open to accepting residents from all communities. As with most Canadian communities, there is at least one hockey rink in every city or town in the West Island. These facilities have, in the past, also served as venues for rock concerts and the like. A notable example was the old Pierrefonds Arena, demolished in the late-1990s, which once attracted bands like the Eagles and Black Sabbath when it was difficult for most West Island youth to reach downtown concert venues.

DDO and Pointe Claire both boast large civic centres replete with Olympic-sized pools and appropriate diving platforms, and the West Island has a noticeable youth subculture focused on swimming, diving and life-guarding at community pools.

The world-famous Royal Golf Club of Montreal is located in Ile-Bizard and is one of eight golf greens in the West Island, the majority of which are private. Other typical West Island sports and recreation facilities include numerous tennis clubs and courts, curling clubs and the occasional bocci pitch.

Other notable West Island sports and recreation facilities include the West Island YMCA and YM/YWHA, Dollard-des-Ormeaux&#x27;s Centennial Park (with hills ideally suited for tobogganing and forests inter-laced with cross-country ski trails), Cap St. Jacques (which features the only remaining beach open to the public on the island) and the facilities affiliated with John Abbott College. In addition, numerous sports leagues for children and youth utilize facilities shared with local primary and secondary schools.

The area is home to the North Shore Lions football Bantam team as well as their older team the North Shore Mustangs, which compete at a midget division 1 AAA level, which holds the most division and provincial titles in Quebec Midget Football League (QMFL) history.

==Points of interest==

Fritz Farm, a community cultural centre in Baie-D&#x27;Urfé located at 20477 Chemin Lakeshore on a large common green bordering picturesque Lake Saint-Louis. Fritz Farm is one of several examples of preserved heritage homes dating back to the 18th century that can be found in Baie-D&#x27;Urfé, which are a direct link to the West Island&#x27;s colonial era.

Église Sainte-Geneviève, a parish church established in 1741 by Antoine Faucon and completed in its present form in 1844. It is located at the intersection of Rue St-Louis and Gouin Boulevard West in the village of Sainte-Geneviève and is part of a larger complex that includes a presbytery and cemetery and a municipal park along the banks of the scenic Rivière des Prairies.

Saint-Joachim de Pointe-Claire Church &amp; Pointe-Claire Village, another parish church established in the mid-18th century, though completed only in 1885 in a Gothic-revival style, designed by noted local church architect Victor Bourgeau. It is located at 2 Ste-Anne Street in Pointe Claire Village. Permanent settlement in this part of the West Island dates back at least as far as 1710, when the emblematic Pointe-Claire Windmill was completed. The Village features many 19th century and early 20th century buildings and forms an important local small-business sector. There are many restaurants and boutiques in the area, in addition to the exclusive Beaconsfield Golf Club and the Pointe-Claire Curling Club. Othe sites of interest include the Pointe-Claire Windmill &amp; Summer Retreat of the Congregation Notre Dame.

Centennial Hall, in Beaconsfield – a community cultural centre and small-scale performance venue.

Stewart Hall, in Pointe-Claire – an art gallery and community cultural centre and small-scale performance venue.

The Museum of Local History and Heritage located at 1850 Lakeshore Drive and adjacent to the large linear parks that stretch from Dorval along the edge of Lac Saint-Louis east towards Old Lachine Village where the old public beaches used to be. There are several marinas in the area and each summer the lake is filled with diverse pleasure craft. Wind-surfing here is quite popular, though public bathing is illegal and generally discouraged. Fishing is popular, though again, it is unwise to consume anything caught.

The Morgan Arboretum and Ecomuseum Zoo, a zoo dedicated to animal species endemic to the Eastern Great Lakes lowland forest, located in one of the last old growth example of the type on-island. The Ecomuseum is, along with Montréal&#x27;s Biodome and Insectarium, one of the key local public zoological institutions that have found innovative solutions to the problems with &#x27;traditional zoos&#x27;.

Old Saint-Anne&#x27;s Village and the Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue Canal, another area in the West Island where permanent settlement dates back to the mid-late 17th century, Sainte-Anne&#x27;s became a focal point for local services with the development of Macdonald College and the Veterans Hospital during the early 20th century. The Village has many restaurants and bars and other services supporting the comparatively large student population. The area features a boardwalk, the old Rex Theatre and numerous specialty shops. Other features include the Gallipeault Bridge which connects Sainte-Anne&#x27;s to Ile Perot.

The and the Macdonald Experimental Farm, co-located at McGill&#x27;s Macdonald Campus in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue.

Fort Senneville, originally built in 1671 and destroyed and re-built twice, the Fort was captured and destroyed by Benedict Arnold in 1776 during manœuvres associated with the Battle of The Cedars during the American War of Independence. A commemorative plaque located along Chemin Senneville by the Lake of Two Mountains records the location of the battle associated with the fall of the Fort. All that remains today is part of the windmill which doubled as a watch-tower and the foundations of the seigneurial house, if not some portions of the walls. The site is on private property though the proprietor has been known to allow visitors if they ask politely.

Cap-Saint-Jacques Nature Park – the largest nature park on the island also features the only remaining public beach and an organic farm.

Rapides du Cheval Blanc Listed as one of the ten Eco-territories of Montreal The park has a view of the Whitehorse rapids and a wooded area.

<text>Mary Mason Lyon (; February 28, 1797 – March 5, 1849) was an American pioneer in women&#x27;s education. She established the Wheaton Female Seminary in Norton, Massachusetts, (now Wheaton College) in 1834. She then established Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (now Mount Holyoke College) in South Hadley, Massachusetts, in 1837 and served as its first president (or &quot;principal&quot;) for 12 years. Lyon&#x27;s vision fused intellectual challenge and moral purpose. She valued socioeconomic diversity and endeavored to make the seminary affordable for students of modest means.

==Early life==
The daughter of a farming family in Buckland, Massachusetts, Lyon had a hardscrabble childhood. Her father died when she was five, and the entire family pitched in to help run the farm. Lyon was thirteen when her mother remarried and moved away; she stayed behind in Buckland in order to keep the house for her brother Aaron, who took over the farm. Lyon attended various district schools intermittently and, in 1814 at 17, began teaching in them as well, first invited to teach summer school. Lyon&#x27;s modest beginnings fostered her lifelong commitment to extending educational opportunities to girls from middling and poor backgrounds.

Lyon was eventually able to attend two secondary schools, Sanderson Academy in Ashfield and Byfield Seminary in eastern Massachusetts. At Byfield, she was befriended by the headmaster, Rev. Joseph Emerson, and his assistant, Zilpah Polly Grant. She also soaked up Byfield&#x27;s ethos of rigorous academic education infused with Christian commitment. Lyon then taught at several academies, including Sanderson, a small school of her own in Buckland, Adams Female Academy (run by Grant), and the Ipswich Female Seminary (also run by Grant). Lyon&#x27;s attendance at the then novel, popular, lectures in laboratory botany by Amos Eaton influenced her involvement in the female seminary movement.

In 1834, Laban Wheaton and his daughter-in-law, Eliza Baylies Chapin Wheaton, called upon Mary Lyon for assistance in establishing the Wheaton Female Seminary (now Wheaton College) in Norton, Massachusetts. Lyon left teaching and collected donated funds in a characteristic green purse to raise money for the seminary&#x27;s creation. She created the first curriculum with the goal that it be equal in quality to those of men&#x27;s colleges. She also provided the first principal, Eunice Caldwell. Wheaton Female Seminary opened on 22 April 1835, with 50 students and three teachers. Lyon and Caldwell left Wheaton, along with eight Wheaton students, to open Mount Holyoke Female Seminary.

==Mount Holyoke==
During these early years, Lyon gradually developed her vision for Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, which would resemble Grant&#x27;s schools in many respects but, Lyon hoped, draw its students from a wider socioeconomic range. The college was unique in that it was founded by people of modest means and served their daughters, rather than the children of the rich. She was especially influenced by Reverend Joseph Emerson, whose &quot;Discourse on Female Education&quot; (1822) advocated that women should be trained to be teachers rather than &quot;to please the other sex.&quot;

Mount Holyoke opened in 1837: the seminary was ready for &quot;the reception of scholars on November 8, 1837.&quot; Lyon strove to maintain high academic standards: she set rigorous entrance exams and admitted &quot;young ladies of an adult age, and mature character.&quot;

In keeping with her social vision, she limited the tuition to $60/year, about one-third the tuition that Grant charged at Ipswich Female Seminary, which was central to her mission of &quot;appeal[ing] to the intelligence of all classes.&quot; In order to keep costs low, Lyon required students to perform domestic tasks—an early version of work/study. These tasks included preparing meals and washing floors and windows. Emily Dickinson, who attended the Seminary in 1847, was tasked with cleaning knives. But this would not last. As of 2019, Mount Holyoke now estimates the cost of attending the college to be $71,828 per year. The college offers various forms of financial aid.

Lyon, an early believer in the importance of daily exercise for women, required her students to &quot;walk one mile (1.6 km) after breakfast. During New England&#x27;s cold and snowy winters, she reduced the requirement to 45 minutes. Calisthenics—a form of exercise—was taught by teachers in unheated hallways until a storage area was cleared for a gymnasium.

Though Lyon&#x27;s policies were sometimes controversial, the seminary quickly attracted its target student body of 200. Lyon anticipated a change in the role of women and equipped her pupils with an education that was comprehensive, rigorous, and innovative, with particular emphasis on the sciences. She required:

seven courses in the sciences and mathematics for graduation, a requirement unheard of at other female seminaries. She introduced women to &quot;a new and unusual way&quot; to learn science—laboratory experiments which they performed themselves. She organized field trips on which students collected rocks, plants, and specimens for lab work, and inspected geological formations and recently discovered dinosaur tracks.

Lyon developed her ideas on how to educate women when she was assistant principal at Ipswich Female Seminary in Massachusetts. By 1837 she had convinced multiple sponsors to support her ideals and the nation&#x27;s first real college for women. The town of South Hadley had donated the land and main building. Lyon&#x27;s layout of the campus provided a widely imitated model for the higher education of women by providing a physical environment that supported a rigorous and comprehensive curriculum equivalent to that of men&#x27;s colleges. Lyon&#x27;s innovative goals set her Seminary apart from other female seminaries of the period, offering a curriculum equivalent to those at men&#x27;s colleges. All the students worked in one building with little privacy. There was close contact with the all-female faculty, and daily self reports on their personal strengths and weaknesses. The college cut staff to the minimum as the 100 or so students each performed one hour of work a day, handling most of the routine chores like cooking and cleaning and maintaining the grounds. Lyon rejected the goal of the men&#x27;s colleges to promote individualism and independence and instead fostered the collective ideal of a united team of women could match the success of nearby men&#x27;s colleges like Amherst and Williams. The curriculum allowed women to study subjects like geometry, calculus, Latin, Greek, science, philosophy, and history, which were not typically taught at other female seminaries in the 19th century. Lyon&#x27;s efforts in founding an institution of higher education for women, despite the economic challenges of the time, paved the way for more women to have the same opportunities for higher education as their brothers.

Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was one of several Christian institutions of higher education for young women established during the first half of the 19th century. Prior to founding Mount Holyoke, Lyon contributed to the development of both Hartford Female Seminary and Ipswich Female Seminary. She was also involved in the creation of &quot;Wheaton Female Seminary&quot; (now Wheaton College) in 1834. Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was chartered as a teaching seminary in 1836 and opened its doors to students on 8 November 1837. Both Vassar College and Wellesley College were patterned after Mount Holyoke.

According to historian Amanda Porterfield, Lyon created Mount Holyoke to be &quot;a religious institution that offered a model of Christian society for all to see.&quot; Students &quot;were required to attend church services, chapel talks, prayer meetings, and Bible study groups. Twice a day teachers and students spent time in private devotions. Every dorm room had two large lighted closets to give roommates privacy during their devotions&quot;. Mount Holyoke Female Seminary was the sister school to Andover Seminary. By 1859 there were more than 60 missionary alumnae; by 1887 the school&#x27;s alumnae comprised one-fifth of all female American missionaries for the ABCFM; and by the end of the century, 248 of its alumnae had entered the mission field.

==Religion==
Conforti (1993) examines the central importance of religion to Lyon. She was raised a Baptist but converted to a Congregationalist under the influence of her teacher Reverend Joseph Emerson. Lyon preached revivals at Mount Holyoke, spoke elsewhere, and, though not a minister, was a member of the fellowship of New England&#x27;s New Divinity clergy. She played a major role in the revival of the thought of Jonathan Edwards, whose works were read more frequently then than in his day. She was attracted by his ideas of self-restraint, self-denial, and disinterested benevolence.

==Death==
Lyon died of erysipelas (possibly contracted from an ill student in her care) on March 5, 1849. Lyon was buried on the Mount Holyoke College campus, in front of Porter Hall and behind the Amphitheatre. Her burial site is marked with a granite marker surrounded by an iron fence.

==Legacy==
Mary Lyon developed her ideas on how to educate women when she was assistant principal at Ipswich Female Seminary in Massachusetts. When she was age 40 she had convinced sponsors to sponsor her new school—the first real college for women. Mount Holyoke Female Seminary opened on November 8, 1837, in South Hadley, Massachusetts. The town had donated the land and main building. Lyon&#x27;s layout of the campus provided a widely imitated model for the higher education of women by providing a physical environment that supported a rigorous and comprehensive curriculum equivalent to that of men&#x27;s colleges. Lyon&#x27;s innovative goals set her Seminary apart from other female seminaries of the period, offering a curriculum equivalent to those at men&#x27;s colleges. All the students worked in one building with little privacy. There was close contact with the all-female faculty, and daily self reports on their personal strengths and weaknesses. The college cut staff to the minimum as the 100 or so students each performed one hour of work a day, handling most of the routine chores like cooking and cleaning and maintaining the grounds. Lyon rejected the goal of the men&#x27;s colleges to promote individualism and independence and instead fostered the collective ideal of a united team of women could match the success of nearby men&#x27;s colleges like Amherst and Williams. The curriculum allowed women to study subjects like geometry, calculus, Latin, Greek, science, philosophy, and history, which were not typically taught at other female seminaries in the 19th century. Lyon&#x27;s efforts in founding an institution of higher education for women, despite the economic challenges of the time, paved the way for more women to have the same opportunities for higher education as their brothers.

According to historian Annette Baxter, Lyon was devout, practical, and firmly committed to the educational orthodoxies of the era, while pioneering an entirely new role for women educators and students. She was adaptable and adventuresome, self-sufficient, and devoted to service. Her personal strengths reemerged in the foundations of Mount Holyoke Seminary. For example, it required all students to work, regardless of family wealth, which helped reduce costs, insured equality on campus, and promoted responsibility for young women living away from home without servants for the first time in their lives. Attention to the curriculum as established by the leading men&#x27;s colleges, was broadened by her promotion of Protestant missionary activism. The college&#x27;s pedagogical approach stressed gradualism, expecting steady progress rather than sudden leaps forward. Her standard of achievement was much higher than the typical finishing school for young women, which was the main competition for the upscale Yankee clientele. Lyon&#x27;s energetic, compassionate and engaging personality earned the affection of faculty, students, alumnae, and supporters. While her own background was relatively narrow, her aspirations for her students were to give them the self-confidence that they could achieve whatever they set out to do.

Many buildings have been named in her honor, including Mary Lyon Hall at Mount Holyoke College. Built in 1897 on the site of the former Seminary Building, the hall houses college offices, classrooms, and a chapel. Mount Holyoke College continues to honor her legacy through the commencement ceremonies held next to her gravesite. The main classroom building for Wheaton Female Seminary, originally called New Seminary Hall, was renamed Mary Lyon Hall in 1910 and still features prominently on the campus of Wheaton College. Dormitories named after Mary Lyon can also be found at Miami University, Plymouth State University in New Hampshire, Swarthmore College, and University of Massachusetts Amherst. Mary Lyon Elementary School in Tacoma, Washington is named after her. Lyon K–8 and the Mary Lyon Pilot High School in Boston, Massachusetts are named after her.

Vassar College, Wellesley College and the former Western College for Women were patterned after Mount Holyoke and Mary Lyon&#x27;s work led to Ann Dudin Brown founding Westfield College in London. Oklahoma&#x27;s Cherokee Female Seminary (now Northeastern State University) acquired its &quot;first faculty for their female seminary from Mount Holyoke, [and] also used the Massachusetts school as a pattern for the institution they established.&quot;

In 1905, Lyon was inducted into the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in New York. In 1993, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York.

She has been honored by the United States Postal Service with a 2¢ Great Americans series postage stamp.

<text>Family Theater is a weekly half-hour dramatic anthology radio program which aired on the Mutual Broadcasting System in the United States from February 13, 1947, to September 11, 1957.

==Production history==
&quot;Family Theater&quot; developed from a Rosary prayer program on a local radio station in Albany, New York, started in 1943 by Holy Cross priest Patrick Peyton. On Mother&#x27;s Day 1945, he produced a similar national radio program on the Mutual Broadcasting System.

In 1947, Peyton formed Family Theater Productions, a film and radio studio extension of the Family Rosary Crusade founded by Peyton to promote family prayer. The program had no commercial sponsor. By agreement with the Mutual network, the radio dramas were nonsectarian but focused on moral problems. Mutual provided the airtime, while Peyton covered production costs through donations.

A total of 482 original episodes were produced. The program featured not only religious stories, but also half-hour adaptations of literary works such as &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, and &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

Peyton and Family Theater Productions continued in radio and expanded into films and television. Peyton arranged for many of Hollywood&#x27;s stars in film and radio at the time to appear on &quot;Family Theater&quot;. Throughout its ten-year run, well-known actors and actresses, including James Stewart, Gregory Peck, Dennis Morgan, Dorothy Warenskjold, Irene Dunne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Shirley Temple, Natalie Wood, Barbara Whiting, Raymond Burr, Jane Wyatt, Charlton Heston, Lizabeth Scott, Bing Crosby, Jack Benny, Gene Kelly, Kate Smith, William Shatner, and Chuck Connors, appeared as announcers, narrators, or stars. Many donated their services.

&quot;Family Theater&quot; was broadcast in the United States, Canada, Latin American, Australia, Mozambique, and the Philippines and won a number of industry awards. The motto of Family Theater Productions is &quot;The family that prays together stays together.&quot;

==Television==
In 1951, while the radio version was still on the air, &quot;Family Theater&quot; moved to television, where it aired in syndication. The spelling of the title was altered to &quot;Family Theatre&quot; and the series was extended to one hour. Father Peyton also hosted the TV version, which ran for seven years.

One of the TV episodes was &quot;Hill Number One&quot;, famous for featuring an early appearance by James Dean as John the Apostle (not John the Baptist, as is commonly thought). It combined a Korean War story with the story of the Crucifixion of Christ.

==Present day==
After Peyton&#x27;s death in 1992, Family Theater Productions became part of Holy Cross Family Ministries, sponsored by the Congregation of Holy Cross.

&quot;Family Theater&quot;, now digitally remastered, continues to air in reruns in the United States and many other parts of the world. EWTN, for instance, airs the program on Sunday nights under the name &quot;Family Theater Classic Radio&quot;. In addition, the program is available to download or stream on internet services such as the Internet Archive.

<doc id="392855" wikidata="Q164607" url="?curid=392855" title="Piano Concerto No. 17 (Mozart)">
<text>The Piano Concerto No. 17 in G major, K. 453, was written in 1784 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

The work is orchestrated for solo piano, flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns in G (and C for &quot;Andante&quot;), and strings. Like most of Mozart&#x27;s concertos, it is in three movements:
According to the date that the composer himself noted on the score, the concerto was completed on 12 April 1784.

The date of the premiere is uncertain. In one view, the work is said to have been premiered by Mozart&#x27;s student Barbara Ployer on June 13, 1784, at a concert to which Mozart had invited Giovanni Paisiello to hear both her and his new compositions, including also his recently written Quintet in E flat for Piano and Winds. Afterwards, Ployer was joined by Mozart in a performance of the Sonata for Two Pianos, K. 448. Another possibility, advanced by Lorenz (2006, 314), is that Mozart did not wait over two months to premiere the work, but performed it in his concert with Regina Strinasacchi on 29 April 1784 at the Kärntnertortheater. As a general consensus for researchers, it can be said with relative certainty that the work premiered during the mid-to-late spring of 1784, following its completion.

The finale is a variation movement whose theme was sung by Mozart&#x27;s starling.

<text>James Bowdoin II ( ; August 7, 1726 – November 6, 1790) was an American political and intellectual leader from Boston, Massachusetts, during the American Revolution and the following decade. He initially gained fame and influence as a wealthy merchant. He served in both branches of the Massachusetts General Court from the 1750s to the 1770s. Although he was initially supportive of the royal governors, he opposed British colonial policy and eventually became an influential advocate of independence. He authored a highly political report on the 1770 Boston Massacre that has been described by historian Francis Walett as one of the most influential pieces of writing that shaped public opinion in the colonies.

From 1775 to 1777, he served as president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress&#x27;s executive council, the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Massachusetts government. He was elected president of the constitutional convention that drafted the state&#x27;s constitution in 1779, and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1780, losing to John Hancock. In 1785, following Hancock&#x27;s resignation, he was elected governor. Due to the large debts of Massachusetts, incurred from the Revolutionary War, Bowdoin ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility. During his two years in office, the combination of poor economic conditions and his harsh fiscal policy laid down by his government led to the uprising known as Shays&#x27; Rebellion. Bowdoin personally funded militia forces that were instrumental in putting down the uprising. His high-handed treatment of the rebels may have contributed to his loss of the 1787 election, in which the populist Hancock was returned to office.

In addition to his political activities, Bowdoin was active in scientific pursuits, collaborating with Benjamin Franklin in his pioneering research on electricity. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1787. He was a founder and first president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, to whom he bequeathed his library. Bowdoin College in Maine was named in his honor after a bequest by his son James III.

==Early life==

James Bowdoin II was born in Boston to Hannah Portage Bowdoin and James Bowdoin, a wealthy Boston merchant. His grandfather, Pierre Baudouin, was a Huguenot refugee from France. Pierre took his family first to Ireland, then to eastern Massachusetts (present-day Maine), before finally settling in Boston in 1690. James Bowdoin I had a modest inheritance from his parents, but greatly expanded his father&#x27;s merchant business and land holdings to become one of the wealthiest men in the province. Young James attended the South Grammar School (now Boston Latin School), then graduated from Harvard College in 1745. When his father died in 1747, he inherited a considerable fortune. He married Elizabeth Erving, sister of his Harvard roommate, in 1748. They had two children. That same year, he received his master&#x27;s degree from Harvard.

==Scientific and other pursuits==

Bowdoin may have met Benjamin Franklin as early as 1743, and the two became frequent collaborators and correspondents on scientific subjects. During his Harvard years, he was educated in the sciences by John Winthrop, and developed an interest in electricity and astronomy. In 1750, Bowdoin traveled to Philadelphia to meet with Franklin. Bowdoin was interested in Franklin&#x27;s experiments on electricity, and Franklin solicited his advice on papers he prepared for submission to the Royal Society. Through the offices of Franklin, some of Bowdoin&#x27;s letters were read to the Society. Bowdoin was instrumental in gaining support in the provincial assembly for an expedition to Newfoundland to observe the 1761 transit of Venus across the sun, and in the same year published a treatise suggesting improvements to the telescope. In 1785 he published a series of memoirs arguing against Isaac Newton&#x27;s theory that light was transmitted by &quot;corpuscles&quot;, citing both natural observations and Scripture.

Bowdoin maintained a lifelong interest in the sciences. In 1780 he was one of the founders of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served as its first president until his death and left the society his library. Bowdoin published not only scientific papers, but poetry in both English and Latin. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Edinburgh and made a fellow of Harvard. His 1788 election to the Royal Society of London was the first such honor bestowed on an American after independence.

Bowdoin also had extensive business interests. Although he was often characterized as a merchant, and he engaged in the Atlantic trade, his principal interest was in land. His inheritance included major tracts of land, most of which he kept, in present-day Maine as well as in the agriculturally rich Elizabeth Islands off the state&#x27;s south coast. Bowdoin expanded his holdings, eventually acquiring property in all of the New England states except Rhode Island. He was one of the managing proprietors of a large territory on the Kennebec River, where he was frequently involved in legal proceedings with squatters on the land, and with competing land interests. The dealings with squatters in particular left Bowdoin with a dislike of the lower classes in Massachusetts society, something that affected his politics. His inheritance also included an ironworks in Attleboro (now Bridgewater) that he sold in 1770, apparently because it was too time-consuming to manage. Despite the upheavals of the Revolution, Bowdoin was careful to always manage his financial affairs. He supported the cause of independence financially, but he did so without damaging his own business interests, unlike John Hancock, whose business suffered from neglect.

In later years he served as the first president of the Massachusetts Bank in 1784 and was also the first president of the Massachusetts Humane Society (an organization initially devoted to rescuing survivors from shipwrecks and other water-based disasters).

==Governor&#x27;s Council and opposition to British rule==

Bowdoin was elected to the provincial assembly in 1753 and served there until named to the governor&#x27;s council in 1756. Although at first supportive of the royal governor, his politics became more radical as British colonial policy became increasingly unpopular, and Bowdoin believed those policies would have a negative effect on the New England economy. Personal factors may also have played a role in Bowdoin&#x27;s shift in views: John Temple, the local customs commissioner and Bowdoin&#x27;s son in law, was embroiled in nasty disputes with Governor Francis Bernard in the 1760s. By 1769 Bowdoin was one of the principal spokesmen of the opposition to the governor on the council. In that year Bernard rejected Bowdoin&#x27;s renewed election to the council. Bowdoin, however, was instrumental in causing Bernard&#x27;s downfall from office. Private letters critical of the provincial government that Bernard had written were published in 1769 to great outrage. Bowdoin rebutted the charges and claims made in Bernard&#x27;s letters, and published a highly polemic pamphlet arguing for Bernard&#x27;s removal that was sent to the colonial secretary, Lord Hillsborough.

Bowdoin won reelection to the assembly in 1770, and was promptly reelected to the council the same year, soon after Bernard left the province. Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson acquiesced to Bowdoin&#x27;s return to the council, reasoning that he was less dangerous there than as an outspoken critic in the lower house. However, the seat Bowdoin vacated in the assembly was taken by Samuel Adams, another leading political opponent of the royal governors, and Hutchinson was faced with the prospect of opposition on both fronts.

After the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770, Bowdoin was chosen by the Boston town meeting to serve on a committee that investigated the affair. The committee took depositions and produced a report describing the event that was published as &quot;A Short Narrative of the Horrid Massacre&quot;. The work was highly critical not only of the governor, but also the behavior of the British Army troops that were stationed in Boston, and is characterized by historian Francis Walett as one of the major propaganda pieces influencing public opinion in the colonies. Bowdoin&#x27;s opposition to British policies continued during the Hutchinson administration, and when letters by Hutchinson were published to outrage similar to the Bernard letters affair, Bowdoin again penned works highly critical of the governor and calling for his removal. Hutchinson&#x27;s successor, General Thomas Gage, vetoed Bowdoin&#x27;s reelection to the council in 1774, citing &quot;express orders from His Majesty&quot; that he be excluded from that body.

==Government of Massachusetts==

Bowdoin as named as a delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774 but did not attend, citing the poor health of his wife. A bout of poor health, probably caused by tuberculosis, at the time also affected him. Bowdoin was again ill in 1775 when the American Revolutionary War broke out, and the family was relocated from British-occupied Boston (which was then under siege by area militia) first to Dorchester, and eventually to Middleborough, where he resided until 1778. (Bowdoin&#x27;s Beacon Street mansion was occupied by General John Burgoyne.) Despite his convalescence he was kept apprised of events occurring in and around Boston, and was elected president of the executive council of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. This position, which he held until 1777, made him the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Massachusetts government. Citing his ongoing poor health, he resigned the post and withdrew from public view. He continued to correspond with other revolutionaries, and enjoyed their confidence, although his absence from the war effort would lead to later political difficulties. He began to return to public life in 1778, and when Massachusetts wrote its own constitution in 1779, he was president of the convention called to create it, and chairman of the committee that drafted it. John Adams, also a committee member, is generally credited as the major author of the new constitution, although Bowdoin and Samuel Adams likely made significant contributions.

In the first gubernatorial election, held in 1780, Bowdoin ran for the office against John Hancock. In the absence of formal party politics, the contest was one of personality, popularity, and patriotism. Hancock was immensely popular, and unquestionably patriotic given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the Second Continental Congress. Bowdoin was cast by Hancock supporters as unpatriotic, citing among other things his refusal to serve in the First Continental Congress (even though it was due to his illness). Bowdoin&#x27;s supporters, who were principally well-off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities, cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace. Hancock won the election easily, receiving more than 90% of the vote. The Massachusetts House of Representatives offered Bowdoin either the lieutenant governorship or a seat in the state senate, but Bowdoin declined both on account of his poor health. After the election Hancock appointed him to a commission to revise and consolidate the state&#x27;s laws.
Bowdoin ran against Hancock in subsequent elections, but was never able to overcome Hancock&#x27;s enormous popularity. The contest between the two men was just one element of a long-running rivalry that encompassed business, politics, and religion, and was apparently deeply personal. The two men were both involved in the administration of Harvard, where their feud sometimes became ugly. For example, in 1776, while Hancock was simultaneously treasurer of Harvard and president of the Second Continental Congress, a committee headed by Bowdoin decided that securities physically held by Hancock were at risk because of the war, and a delegation was sent to Philadelphia to receive an accounting of them and physical custody of the papers. Hancock&#x27;s dilatory responses and refusal to produce an accounting of the college books dragged on for several years, as a result of which Bowdoin orchestrated his censure by the Harvard board of overseers. The matter reached a peak of sorts in 1783 when the college&#x27;s issues with Hancock were read and discussed in an open meeting at which Hancock was the presiding officer. Both Bowdoin and Hancock attended the Brattle Street Church, where they competed with each other over the size and quality of the improvements to the building (and even the location of a new one) that they funded. James Warren captured the differences between the two men: &quot;I don&#x27;t envy either of them their feelings. the Vanity of one will Sting like an Adder if it is disappointed, and the Advancements made by the other if they dont succeed will hurt his &quot;Modest&quot; pride.&quot; The rivalry between the men was so bitter that the founding of Bowdoin College, named in his honor, had to be delayed until after Hancock died.

In 1785, apparently sensitive to rising unrest in western Massachusetts over the poor economy, Hancock offered to resign, expecting to be asked to stay in office. However, the legislature made no such request, and he eventually did resign, pleading poor health. The gubernatorial race that year was dominated by Bowdoin, Lieutenant Governor Thomas Cushing (who was widely viewed as a stand-in for Hancock but lacked his charisma), and Revolutionary War General Benjamin Lincoln. The campaign was at times nasty. Bowdoin and Samuel Adams went after the Hancock-Cushing faction, seizing on the recently established and locally controversial social club (known either as &quot;Sans Souci&quot; or the &quot;Tea Assembly&quot;), at which card play and dancing took place (these activities had previously been banned in socially conservative Boston), as a sign of moral decay that took place under Hancock&#x27;s term. Cushing supporters accused Bowdoin of cowardice in the war and insulting the people for refusing the lieutenant governorship in 1780. The electorate gave no candidate a majority, and the General Court ended up choosing Bowdoin over the others in bitterly divisive voting.

===Shays&#x27; Rebellion===

Governor Hancock had, during his time in office, refused to vigorously act to collect delinquent taxes. Bowdoin, seeking to make payments the state owed against the nation&#x27;s foreign debt, raised taxes and stepped up collection of back taxes. These actions, which were combined with a general post-war economic depression and a credit squeeze caused by a shortage of hard currency, wrought havoc throughout the rural parts of the state. Conventions organized in the rural parts of the state submitted letters of protest to the state legislature, which was dominated by Bowdoin and the conservative wholesale merchants of the coastal portions of the state.
After the legislature adjourned on July 18, 1786, without substantively addressing these complaints, rural Massachusetts protestors organized direct action, and began protest marches that shut down the state&#x27;s court system, which enforced tax and civil forfeiture judgments and had become a focus of the discontent. Bowdoin issued a proclamation in early September denouncing these actions, but took no overt steps to immediately organize a militia response (unlike governors in neighboring Connecticut and New Hampshire). When the foreclosure court in Worcester was shut down by similar action on September 5, the county militia (composed mainly of men sympathetic to the protestors) refused to turn out, much to Bowdoin&#x27;s chagrin. The closure of the Worcester court was followed by closings in Concord and Taunton, and when the militia marched into Great Barrington to force court open there, one of the Judges, William Whiting asked the militiamen to take sides. 800 of the 1,000 men took the people&#x27;s side of the road. By October, one correspondent wrote, &quot;We are now in a state of Anarchy and Confusion bordering on Civil War&quot;.

These court closings mirrored closings in 1774, when colonists had shut down the King&#x27;s business everywhere west of Boston. Fearing a new Revolution, and continuing to ignore the farmers&#x27; petitions, Bowdoin and Samuel Adams and their legislature enacted a Riot Act, suspended &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, and passed a bill that unsuccessfully attempted to address the financial reasons for the protests. By January 1787, the protests, which began as demands for reform, had grown to become a direct attack on the &quot;tyrannical government of Massachusetts&quot;. Hampshire County in particular (which then included what are now Hampden and Franklin Counties) had become a hotbed of rebellion, with leaders like Daniel Shays and Luke Day beginning to organize for an attack on government institutions.

Because the federal government had been unable to raise any significant number of troops and Bowdoin could no longer trust local militias in the western counties, he proposed in early January 1787 the creation of a private militia to be funded by eastern merchants. Revolutionary War General Benjamin Lincoln raised funds and men for the effort, and had 3,000 men in Worcester by January 19. A standoff at the Springfield Armory on January 25 resulted in the death of several rebels, and Lincoln broke the main rebel force on February 4 in Petersham, ending large-scale resistance.

The same day that Lincoln arrived at Petersham, the state legislature passed bills authorizing a state of martial law, giving the governor broad powers to act against the rebels. It also authorized state payments to reimburse Lincoln and the merchants who had funded the army, and authorized the recruitment of additional militia. On February 12 the legislature passed the Disqualification Act, seeking to prevent a legislative response by rebel sympathizers. This bill expressly forbade any acknowledged rebels from holding a variety of elected and appointed offices.

The crushing of the rebellion and the harsh terms of reconciliation imposed by the Disqualification Act all worked against Governor Bowdoin politically. In the election held in April 1787, Bowdoin received few votes from the rural parts of the state and was trounced by John Hancock.

In 1788 Bowdoin served as a member of the Massachusetts convention that ratified the United States Constitution. A strong supporter of Federalism, Bowdoin worked hard for its ratification, bringing a skeptical Samuel Adams and his supporters into the fold by inviting him to a dinner with other pro-ratification delegates, and offering Federalist support to John Hancock in future elections. Bowdoin&#x27;s Federalist supporters backed Hancock in the 1789 election, even though Bowdoin also stood for election. He remained active in his charitable and scientific pursuits in his later years, continuing his leadership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as that of the Humane Society. He also continued to engage in new business ventures, buying in 1789 an interest in one of the first American merchant ships to sail to China.

==Death and legacy==

He died in Boston on November 6, 1790, of &quot;putrid fever and dysentery&quot;. Bowdoin&#x27;s funeral was one of the largest of the time in Boston, with people lining the streets to view the funeral procession. He was interred in Boston&#x27;s Granary Burying Ground. Among his bequests was a gift to Harvard College for awards that are now known as the Bowdoin Prizes. His son James III donated lands from the family estate in Brunswick, Maine, as well as funds and books, to establish Bowdoin College in his honor.

An orrery constructed by clockmaker Joseph Pope, now in Harvard&#x27;s science department, includes bronze figures of Bowdoin and Benjamin Franklin that were supposedly cast by Paul Revere. (Bowdoin was responsible for having the device rescued when Pope&#x27;s house caught fire in 1787.)

Landmarks bearing the Bowdoin name in Boston include Bowdoin Street, Bowdoin Square, and the Bowdoin MBTA station. Bowdoin, Maine, incorporated 1788, was named for Bowdoin; neighboring Bowdoinham, Maine (incorporated 1762) was named either for his grandfather Pierre or his brother William.

<text>Corneliu Vadim Tudor (; 28 November 1949 – 14 September 2015), also colloquially known as &quot;Tribunul&quot;, was a poet, writer, and journalist who was the leader of the Greater Romania Party () and a Member of the European Parliament. He was a Romanian senator from 1992 to 2008. He was born and died in Bucharest, Romania.

As a political figure, he was known for having held strong nationalist views, which were reflected in his rhetoric and his denunciation of political opponents (a tactic which the judgements in several civil lawsuits handed down against him deemed to be slanderous). He was most commonly referred to as &quot;Vadim&quot;, which was a name he selected for himself, not a family name (and not shared with his brother, former Romanian Army officer ). 

==Biography==
Tudor was born in Bucharest on 28 November 1949, into a working-class family, his father being a tailor. In his youth, being an admirer of the French film director Roger Vadim, he chose the pseudonym Vadim as his middle name.

In 1971, he received a degree in sociology from the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Bucharest, and in 1975, he studied at the School for Reserve Officers in Bucharest. With the help of his mentor, Herder Prize winner Eugen Barbu, he obtained a scholarship and studied in Vienna from 1978 to 1979. During the communist era, he worked as a journalist, editor, and poet: in the early 1970s, he was one of the editors at &quot;România liberă&quot;, and after 1975 was an editor at the Romanian official press agency, Agerpress. He served as senator from 1992 to 2008. For the first time since 1990, after the election of 30 November 2008, he and his party were no longer present in either of the Romanian legislative chambers. On 25 September 2001, Tudor renounced his parliamentary immunity from prosecution.

In December 2004, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel returned the &quot;Steaua României&quot; medal, one of the country&#x27;s highest honors, after President Ion Iliescu awarded Tudor the same honor in the last days of his presidency. Wiesel said he was returning the honor because he could not &quot;accept being placed on the same level&quot; as Tudor and fellow party member (and honor recipient) Gheorghe Buzatu. 15 Radio Free Europe journalists, Timișoara mayor Gheorghe Ciuhandu, songwriter , and historian Randolph Braham all returned their &quot;Steaua României&quot; medals as well due to the awards given Tudor and Buzatu. Tudor&#x27;s &quot;Steaua României&quot; award was revoked by Romanian president Traian Băsescu in May 2007. Tudor consequently announced that he would sue Băsescu for abuse of power; in the end, Tudor won the trial with Băsescu.

As a poet he made his debut in May 1965 at the national radio station with a poem read in the George Călinescu literary circle. He published several volumes of prose and poetry: &quot;Poezii&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;; 1977), &quot;Epistole vieneze&quot; (&quot;Viennese Epistles&quot;; 1979), &quot;Poeme de dragoste, ură și speranță&quot; (&quot;Poems of Love, Hatred and Hope&quot;; 1981), &quot;Idealuri&quot; (&quot;Ideals&quot;; 1983), &quot;Saturnalii&quot; (&quot;Saturnalia&quot;, 1983), &quot;Istorie și civilizatie&quot; (&quot;History and Civilization&quot;; 1983), &quot;Mândria de a fi români&quot; (&quot;The Pride of Being Romanian&quot;; 1985), &quot;Miracole&quot; (&quot;Miracles&quot;; 1986 anthology), &quot;Jurnal de vacanță&quot; (&quot;Holiday Journal&quot;, 1996), &quot;Poems&quot; (translated in seven languages, published in Torino, Italy, 1998), &quot;Europa Creștină&quot; (&quot;Christian Europe&quot;), and &quot;Artificii&quot; (&quot;Artifices&quot;; 2010).

==Personal life==
Tudor was married and had two children. He died of a heart attack on 14 September 2015 in his native Bucharest, and was buried in the city&#x27;s Ghencea Cemetery.

His daughter, Lidia Vadim Tudor, is a candidate for the Alliance for the Union of Romanians in the 2024 Romanian local elections.

==Ideology==
In June 1990, Tudor and Eugen Barbu founded the nationalist weekly magazine &quot;România Mare&quot; (&quot;Greater Romania&quot;), which began as a magazine for the government&#x27;s policies. Later evidence affirmed &quot;Greater Romania&quot; was released with the help of the Communist administration in Bucharest.

In 1991, they founded the Greater Romania Party, the platform of which &quot;Time&quot; magazine described as &quot;a crude mixture of anti-Semitism, racism and nostalgia for the good old days of communism&quot;. Some statements and articles by Tudor and his colleagues can be described as ultranationalist, anti-Hungarian, anti-Roma and homophobic.

Besides Moldova, Tudor wanted Greater Romania to include Bessarabia, Budjak, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertsa region, which have belonged to Ukraine since the dissolution of the Soviet Union but were part of Moldavia until the Russian annexation in 1812, and part of Romania between 1918 and 1940 and between 1941 and 1944. &quot;România Mare&quot; has been sued for libel with stunning frequency, often for Tudor&#x27;s own writings (which he usually, if not always, signed under the pseudonym &quot;Alcibiade&quot;). Between 1993 and 1996, his party supported the leftist governmental coalition (the &quot;Red Quadrilateral&quot;).

Tudor&#x27;s and his party&#x27;s change from national communism to ultranationalism took place after 1996. In 1999, Dan Corneliu Hudici, a former reporter at &quot;România Mare&quot;, claimed there was a &quot;secret blacklist&quot; of dozens of politicians (including President Emil Constantinescu), journalists, and businessmen to be arrested if Tudor&#x27;s party came to power. That allegation only increase Tudor&#x27;s popularity. In the first round of the Romanian presidential elections on 26 November 2000, Tudor finished second with 28% of the vote. Four years earlier, he had come in fifth. However, nearly all other parties backed Ion Iliescu in the 11 December runoff, and Tudor only gained five points compared to his first round performance while Iliescu surged from 36% to 67%.

Tudor supported Romania&#x27;s entry to the European Union and sustained its presence in NATO. In 2003, Tudor claimed to have changed his views on Jews and the Holocaust. In a letter dated 1 February 2004, he retracted certain earlier statements he had made as inappropriately anti-Semitic. Further, he wrote: &quot;I know that I was wrong to have denied the Holocaust in Romania, which happened between 1941 and 1944 under Antonescu&#x27;s regime&quot;. Many publicly questioned his sincerity and motivations of the change and viewed it simply as a political ploy.

Ahead of the 2000 presidential election, Tudor, who finished in second, made the reintroduction of capital punishment a major plank of his campaign.

On 18 October 2012, while he was speaking on the talk show &quot;Romania la Raport&quot;, Tudor said that &quot;in Romania there was never a Holocaust ... I will deny it till I die because I love my people&quot;.

He fired an advisor, who happened to be Jewish and a member of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies, Nati Meir. Tudor claimed it was because of allegations of bribery, but Meir claimed it was because of antisemitism. It turned out that the Romanian press discovered that Meir had been convicted in Israel of banking fraud and so was incompatible with the office of member of the Chamber of Deputies.

On 15 November 2006, Meir was brought to trial by the Romanian authorities for tax evasion, fraud and swindling and was accused of illegalities concerning work permits for Israel. Tudor styled himself &quot;The Tribune&quot;, a title that originates in Ancient Rome but has more combative meaning in Romanian history since it stood for certain activists in the self-defence of Romanian communities in Transylvania against the Revolutionary government in Hungary (see Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas).

<doc id="392870" wikidata="Q6130037" url="?curid=392870" title="James Bowdoin III">
<text>James Bowdoin III (September 22, 1752 – October 11, 1811) was an American philanthropist and statesman from Boston, Massachusetts. He was born to James Bowdoin in Boston, and graduated from Harvard College in 1771. James then studied law at Oxford and traveled widely in Europe until 1775. When he got the news of the Battle of Lexington he returned home. He served in the Massachusetts state legislature and on the council before attending the Massachusetts’ constitutional convention in 1779 and 1780, and was a candidate in five elections to the U.S. House in 1792, 1793, and 1796.

James devoted several years to scholarly pursuits, until he was appointed the United States Ambassador to Spain in 1804. He arrived in Madrid in May, 1805 but never actually assumed the post of ambassador. In March 1806 he and John Armstrong of New York were named commissioners to negotiate boundaries and other issues with Spain. He returned home in 1808 when the talks in Paris ended without success. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1786.

When Bowdoin College was founded in Maine, he gave the new school 6,000 acres (24 km2) and $5,500. When he died, he also bequeathed his considerable library, papers, mineral collection, scientific apparatus and art collection to the school. He died in 1811 on Naushon Island in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts.

<doc id="392871" wikidata="Q6984183" url="?curid=392871" title="Neal Dow">
<text>Neal Dow (March 20, 1804 – October 2, 1897) was an American Prohibition advocate and politician. Nicknamed the &quot;Napoleon of Temperance&quot; and the &quot;Father of Prohibition&quot;, Dow was born to a Quaker family in Portland, Maine. From a young age, he believed alcohol to be the cause of many of society&#x27;s problems and wanted to ban it through legislation. In 1850, Dow was elected president of the Maine Temperance Union, and the next year he was elected mayor of Portland. Soon after, largely due to Dow&#x27;s efforts, the state legislature banned the sale and production of alcohol in what became known as the Maine law. Serving twice as mayor of Portland, Dow enforced the law with vigor and called for increasingly harsh penalties for violators. In 1855, his opponents rioted and he ordered the state militia to fire on the crowd. One man was killed and several wounded, and when public reaction to the violence turned against Dow, he chose not to seek reelection.

Dow was later elected to two terms in the Maine House of Representatives, but retired after a financial scandal. He joined the Union Army shortly after the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, eventually attaining the rank of brigadier general. He was wounded at the siege of Port Hudson and later captured. After being exchanged for another officer in 1864, Dow resigned from the military and devoted himself once more to prohibition. He spoke across the United States, Canada, and Great Britain in support of the cause. In 1880, Dow headed the Prohibition Party ticket for President of the United States. After losing the election, he continued to write and speak on behalf of the prohibition movement for the rest of his life until his death in Portland at the age of 93.

==Early life and family==
Dow was born in Portland, Maine on March 20, 1804, the son of Josiah Dow and his wife, Dorcas Allen Dow. Josiah Dow was a member of the Society of Friends (commonly known as Quakers) and a farmer originally from New Hampshire. Dorcas Allen was also a Quaker, and a member of a prosperous Maine family headed by her prominent grandfather, Hate-Evil Hall. They had three children, of whom Neal was the middle child and only son. After his marriage, Dow&#x27;s father opened a tannery in Portland, which soon became a successful business. After attending a Friends school in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and further schooling at Edward Payson&#x27;s Portland Academy, Dow followed his father into the tanning trade in 1826. He embraced technology, becoming one of the first in the city to incorporate steam power in the tanning process.

Dow struggled to conform to the tenets of his parents&#x27; Quaker faith; he was hot-tempered and enjoyed brawling from a young age. As he became wealthy later in life, he enjoyed wearing fine clothes, contrary to the Quakers&#x27; preference for plain dress. Some of his family&#x27;s other virtues, such as thrift and abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, he adopted early in life. When he turned eighteen, Dow sought to avoid the required militia musters, more out of distaste for the drunkenness that they often involved than out of Quaker belief in pacifism. Instead, he joined the volunteer fire department, whose members were exempted from the muster. In 1827, Dow lobbied the Maine legislature to reform the fire companies to increase their efficiency. That same year, he argued against his fire company serving alcohol at its anniversary celebration; the members compromised, and served only wine, not hard liquor. At times Dow let his politics interfere with his duties; after being promoted to fire chief, he allowed a liquor store to burn to the ground.

The next year, Dow met his future wife, Maria Cornelia Maynard, the daughter of a Massachusetts merchant. They married on January 20, 1830. Over the next twenty years, they had nine children, five of whom (two sons and three daughters) survived infancy. Maria Cornelia was a Congregationalist, and Dow attended services with her at Second Parish Church regularly, although he never became a member. Their home, built at 714 Congress Street in Portland in 1829, was converted into a museum after Dow&#x27;s death and is administered by the local chapter of the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union as the Neal Dow House.

==Temperance advocate==
===Early Prohibition efforts===
In the 19th century, a typical American male consumed on average more than three times the alcohol of his modern-day counterpart. In his memoirs, Dow noted that in Portland a significant portion of a working man&#x27;s pay was in the form of daily rum rations: &quot;it was ... the rule to quit work at eleven in the forenoon and four in the afternoon to drink ... In every grocer&#x27;s shop were casks [of] ... rum punch constantly prepared in a tub, sometimes on the sidewalk, just as lemonade is to be seen now on the Fourth of July.&quot; He saw alcohol as responsible for the downfall of individuals, families, and fortunes, often pointing out ramshackle homes or businesses to his family and saying &quot;Rum did that.&quot; His quest to reform people by reforming their environment grew out of the religious movements of the Second Great Awakening and, as historian Judith N. McArthur later wrote, &quot;temperance reformers urged their listeners to cast Demon Rum out of their lives just as evangelical ministers exhorted them to cast the Devil out of their hearts.&quot;

Many of Portland&#x27;s middle- and upper-class citizens, including Dow, believed drunkenness was a great threat to the city&#x27;s moral and financial well-being. In 1827, he became a founding member of the Maine Temperance Society. The group initially focused its efforts on the evils of distilled beverages, but by 1829, Dow declared he would abstain from all alcoholic beverages. At the same time, he associated himself with anti-Masonic and anti-slavery causes and became more involved with politics generally. In the 1832 presidential election, unsatisfied with both Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay, Dow backed William Wirt, a minor-party candidate.

In 1837, the Maine Temperance Society split over whether they should seek to ban wine as well as spirits; Dow sided with the anti-wine forces, who formed their own organization, the Maine Temperance Union. That year James Appleton, a Whig representative in the state legislature, proposed a prohibition law, and Dow spoke often and forcefully in favor of the effort, which was unsuccessful. Appleton proposed a similar law in 1838 and 1839, but despite his and Dow&#x27;s best efforts, he continued to be defeated.
Dow worked fervently on behalf of Whig candidates and came to detest Democrats as the tools of the alcohol industry. Maine&#x27;s Whig governor, Edward Kent, granted Dow a colonel&#x27;s commission in the state militia in 1841 as a reward for his efforts, despite his lack of military experience. Nevertheless, Dow did not consider himself &quot;a party man in the politician&#x27;s understanding of the term,&quot; and had no qualms about encouraging his supporters to vote against any Whig whom he considered insufficiently anti-alcohol.

Dow spent the early 1840s attending to his tanning business, but also found time to encourage individual drinkers to take up abstinence. In 1842, he and his allies succeeded in getting the city government in Portland to require licenses for liquor dealers and to prosecute unlicensed sellers; a referendum on the question was decided in the prohibitionists&#x27; favor later that year. The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely. Dow kept up his speaking efforts around the state, despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer.

In 1846, Dow spoke before the legislature in favor of statewide prohibition. The bill passed but lacked the enforcement mechanisms necessary to give it effect. The following year, he ran for the state legislature in a special election but was narrowly defeated. In 1850, now a member of the new Free Soil Party, he encouraged like-minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law. They did so but saw it vetoed by Democratic governor John W. Dana. The legislature fell one vote short of overriding the veto.

===Mayor of Portland===

In 1850, Dow was elected president of the Maine Temperance Union. The next year, he ran for mayor of Portland on the Whig ticket, and was elected by a vote of 1332 to 986. Within a month of taking office, he lobbied the state legislature to pass a statewide prohibition law. It did so, and Dow met with the new Governor, John Hubbard, who signed the bill into law on June 2. Maine was the first state to ban alcohol, and statewide prohibition became known around the country as &quot;the Maine law&quot;. The law&#x27;s passage propelled Dow to national fame. He was called the &quot;Napoleon of Temperance&quot;, and was the featured speaker in August at a National Temperance Convention in New York City.

After the Maine law came into force, Dow allowed liquor dealers a two-week grace period to sell their stock out of state, then began confiscations. His enforcement efforts quickly drove respectable drinking establishments out of business, but less fancy saloons, especially those frequented by Portland&#x27;s poor and immigrant residents, simply moved their operations to secret locations. Even so, Dow proclaimed in an address to the city council that he had eliminated all but a &quot;few secret grog-shops&quot;, whose persistence he blamed on &quot;foreigners&quot;.

Despite his growing national fame, Dow continued to face opposition at home. Both Dow and his opponents engaged in anonymous newspaper campaigns against the other, often making personal attacks alongside political arguments. For the 1852 municipal election, the Democrats nominated Albion Parris, a former governor and United States Senator, to run against Dow. While the Democrats rallied behind their candidate, Dow&#x27;s vigorous enforcement of prohibition divided his party, and in two wards the Whigs ran an anti-Dow ticket instead. On election day, Dow slightly increased his vote total from the year before, with 1496, but Parris outpolled him, bringing in 1900 votes. Although the Whigs controlled voter registration at the time, Dow blamed his loss on illegal voting by Irish immigrants.

After his defeat, Dow continued to promote prohibition around the country, and was gratified to see it spread to eleven states. He also made efforts to refute the charge made by his enemies (including his cousin John Neal) that the Maine law was ineffective and that drinking had actually increased in Portland during Dow&#x27;s term in office. In 1854, Dow ran for mayor again unsuccessfully; as the Whig Party began to break apart, Dow attracted support from the Free Soilers and the Know Nothings, a nativist party. By the next year, those two parties began to join anti-slavery Whigs in a new party, the Republicans. They soon controlled the state legislature and, with Dow&#x27;s encouragement, strengthened the enforcement provisions of the Maine law. Dow ran again for mayor in 1855 and was narrowly re-elected to the office he had left three years earlier.

===Portland Rum Riot===
Two months into his term, Dow inadvertently ran afoul of his own prohibition laws. After setting up a committee to dispense alcohol for medicinal and industrial use (the only uses permitted), Dow ordered $1600 worth of alcohol and stored it at City Hall. Dow neglected to appoint an official agent to hold it there; because the invoice was in his name, this placed Dow in technical violation of the law. Dow&#x27;s enemies seized on the mistake and demanded that the police search the municipal building for illegal liquor. Because the recent additions to the Maine law had removed judicial discretion, the judge had no choice but to issue the warrant. Police seized the alcohol, but did not arrest Dow.

That evening, June 2, a crowd of anti-prohibitionists gathered to demand that the law be enforced, shouting threats to spill &quot;Neal Dow&#x27;s liquor&quot;. Dow ordered the state militia to block the protesters and had the sheriff read the crowd the Riot Act. As darkness fell, Dow ordered the crowd to disperse; when they refused, he ordered the militia to fire. One man was killed and seven were wounded, and the crowd fled. On learning of the fatality, Dow maintained that the shooting was justified.

The violence turned public opinion against Dow, and he was denounced in newspapers across the nation. He was tried for violation of the prohibition law; the prosecutor was former U.S. Attorney General Nathan Clifford, a longtime Dow opponent, and the defense attorney was a fellow founder of the Maine Temperance Society, future senator William P. Fessenden. Dow was acquitted, but his opponents convinced the coroner to impanel a jury that pronounced the protester&#x27;s death a homicide. He was ultimately acquitted of that charge, but his popularity had suffered and he declined to run for re-election as mayor.

===State legislator===
Republicans lost the governorship that fall, and in 1856 the Democrats combined with the remaining Whigs in the state legislature to repeal the Maine law entirely. Some of the other states that had passed Maine laws followed suit as they learned that the promised benefits were not forthcoming and enforcement was difficult, if not impossible. Dow continued to travel the country (and the United Kingdom) speaking in support of prohibition, but to little legislative effect. Maine passed a new, much milder Maine law in 1858, which Dow disliked but defended as better than nothing.

In 1858, Dow won a special election to the Maine House of Representatives as a Republican when one of the members elected declined to serve. He won reelection to a full term in 1859, and continued to agitate for stricter prohibition laws, but was unsuccessful. He also became entangled in scandal when the State Treasurer, Benjamin D. Peck, lent out state funds to private citizens (including Dow) contravening state law. Peck lent large sums to himself, which were lost when his business ventures failed. Dow had guaranteed some of Peck&#x27;s borrowing, and faced ruin as it became clear that Peck could not repay the state treasury. Dow was able to settle the debts and conceal much of his role in the affair, but enough of the scandal became known that some of his many enemies attacked him in local newspapers. Even some of his prohibitionist allies became less openly supportive of him. In September 1860, he did not run for re-election.

==Civil War==

Dow continued to promote prohibition after leaving office, but also added his voice to the growing chorus advocating the abolition of slavery. Several slaveholding states seceded after the election of Republican presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, and formed the Confederate States of America; even before the outbreak of the Civil War, Dow called for the rebellion to be crushed and slavery abolished. He was 57 years old at the outbreak of the war, and determined to stay home and tend to his business and care for his aging father. After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, however, Dow felt compelled to join the Union cause. Governor Israel Washburn, Jr. appointed him Colonel of the 13th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment on November 23, 1861. Many of the officers Dow recruited to the cause were his associates from the prohibition movement.

===New Orleans===
After a winter of training in Maine, Dow and the 13th Maine were dispatched to the Gulf of Mexico in February 1862. Even before departing, Dow quarreled with his superiors when he learned his unit would be placed under the command of Major General Benjamin F. Butler, a Democrat whom Dow regarded as soft on slavery and &quot;pro-rum&quot;. Dow&#x27;s protests were ineffective, but they earned Butler&#x27;s enmity. After joining Butler at Fort Monroe, Virginia, the regiment sailed south and was forced to land in North Carolina after a storm; Dow&#x27;s performance in the emergency won Butler&#x27;s praise, but the two still cordially loathed each other. After the damaged ships were repaired, Butler&#x27;s army continued south to Ship Island, Mississippi.

Butler&#x27;s army, aided by Flag Officer David Farragut&#x27;s fleet, captured New Orleans on April 29, 1862. Dow and the 13th Maine did not join in the attack, remaining behind to guard Ship Island. A day earlier, Congress had approved Dow&#x27;s promotion to brigadier general. He blamed Butler for excluding him from the battle, believing that Butler was threatened by his promotion and calling him a &quot;bully and a beast&quot;. He spent much of the time quarreling with his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Francis S. Hesseltine, while the regiment occupied forts around New Orleans. While there, Dow encouraged black slaves to run away from captivity and take shelter with the Union Army. He also confiscated property from nearby planters, including those who supported the Union, and tried unsuccessfully to claim personal salvage rights over Confederate military property abandoned in the river.

In October 1862, Dow was given command over the District of Pensacola, and moved to join other units there. He immediately earned the troops&#x27; disfavor by placing Pensacola under prohibition. He also (without authorization from Washington) began to recruit black troops from the local slave population while continuing his confiscation of rebel property. Butler soon countermanded the confiscation order, which Dow believed was done in revenge for his banning of alcohol.

===Port Hudson and capture===

In December 1862, Nathaniel P. Banks replaced Butler in command at New Orleans. Banks, a Massachusetts Republican with prohibitionist sympathies, had known Dow before the war, but he initially displeased Dow by refusing to repeal Butler&#x27;s order against confiscation of rebel property. He did, however, allow Dow to return to New Orleans to take part in the planned spring offensive. As the Union armies looked to complete their control over the Mississippi River, only Vicksburg, Mississippi and Port Hudson, Louisiana held out against federal control. Major General Ulysses S. Grant moved on Vicksburg from the north while Banks advanced to Port Hudson from the south. By May 21, the town was surrounded.

Banks was determined to break the siege by a direct assault on the Confederate lines. Dow believed the attack to be a mistake, and delayed his units&#x27; participation until later in the day. In the assault, which was unsuccessful, Dow was wounded in the right arm and left thigh and sent to a nearby plantation to convalesce. While in the hospital, he lobbied for a transfer to a theater where his chances of promotion would be greater. On June 30, having healed enough to mount a horse again, Dow visited his troops. As he returned to the hospital after dark, he was captured by Confederate cavalry operating behind Union lines.

Dow was taken by wagon and train to Jackson, Mississippi, then to Montgomery, Alabama, before finally being confined to Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia, the Confederacy&#x27;s capital. In August, he was transferred to Mobile, Alabama, where Confederate officials investigated whether Dow had armed slaves to fight against the rebels, which the Confederate Congress had made a capital offense. Dow had done so, but his prosecutors could find no evidence of such an action after the law was passed, so the charges were dropped and Dow was returned to Libby Prison in October. He remained there until February 1864, when he was exchanged for captive Confederate General William Henry Fitzhugh Lee, son of General Robert E. Lee. His health was damaged by his prison experience, and after spending several months convalescing in Portland, he resigned from the Army in November 1864.

==Postwar politics==
After the war, Dow returned to his leadership of the prohibition movement, co-founding the National Temperance Society and Publishing House with James Black in 1865. He spent the rest of the 1860s and 1870s giving speeches in support of temperance across the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. His efforts produced little success, as the public turned against prohibition and the alcohol industry was better organized to resist. Dow expended a great deal of effort organizing and giving speeches in support of the Liberal Party before the British elections of 1874, as their leader, William Ewart Gladstone, was sympathetic to prohibition; the Liberals lost decisively, a result Gladstone and Dow blamed on liquor interests. Dow continued to promote prohibition in Britain until May 1875 when, exhausted, he returned home.

Against calls for personal temperance instead of government restraint, Dow remained steadfast, saying that the only way to fight drunkenness was &quot;more jail for the rascals.&quot; In 1876, he supported the election of Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican and teetotaler. The following year, Dow saw some success for prohibition as Maine&#x27;s legislature strengthened the weak prohibition law there by banning distilling in the state. Despite that minor victory, Dow began to sour on the Republican party, believing them insufficiently committed to his cause and disappointed at their failure to protect the rights of Southern blacks as Reconstruction came to an end. Other temperance advocates felt the same way, and some had organized a new Prohibition Party in 1869. The Prohibitionists focused their efforts on banning alcohol to the exclusion of all other issues. Most party members came from pietist churches, and most, like Dow, were former Republicans. They had won very few votes in the 1872 and 1876 presidential elections, but as temperance advocates grew disenchanted with the Republican Party, they hoped to win converts in 1880.

===Presidential election of 1880===
In 1880, Maine Republicans refused to pass more anti-alcohol legislation, and Dow quit the party to join the Prohibitionists; he instantly became the party&#x27;s most prominent member. His friend and ally James Black requested that Dow&#x27;s name be placed in nomination for the presidency at the 1880 convention, to which Dow agreed. The convention that met in Cleveland that June welcomed delegates from twelve states, but attracted almost no attention from the press. Dow himself did not attend, staying home with his ailing wife (candidates for a party&#x27;s nomination often did not attend conventions in person at that time). He was nominated, heading a ticket with vice-presidential nominee Henry Adams Thompson of Ohio.

Dow mostly ignored the national contest that summer, focusing on campaigning for pro-temperance candidates in local Maine elections. Republicans, especially James G. Blaine, pressured Dow to withdraw, fearing that he would claim enough votes to cost their nominee, James A. Garfield, the election. Dow declined to do so, but his vote totals were too small to harm Garfield in any case. The Prohibition ticket polled just 10,305 votes, 0.1% of the total. Garfield narrowly won the popular vote over Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock, but in the electoral college, he carried a clear majority. Dow was not displeased with the result, happy that the Republicans had triumphed over the &quot;ex-slavedriving rebel element&quot;.

===Later years===

After the election, Dow began to work with Republicans again in Maine to advance prohibition issues, and in 1884 he endorsed fellow Mainer and Republican candidate for president James G. Blaine. Blaine narrowly lost the election, the first Republican loss in 28 years, and many Republicans blamed the Prohibition Party, whose votes would have tipped New York (and with it the electoral college majority) to Blaine. Resentful Republicans in Maine refused to advance any more prohibition laws, and as a result Dow made his final break with the Republican Party in 1885. In the 1886 state election, he spoke fervently against his former party and in support of the Prohibitionist candidate for governor. In 1888, at the age of 84, Dow accepted the Prohibition Party nomination for mayor of Portland, an office he had held more than thirty years earlier. The Democrats were unable to decide on a candidate, so they endorsed their former enemy, Dow, in an effort to unseat the Republican incumbent. Many regular Democrats refused to support the fusion ticket, and Dow lost the election by 1934 votes to 3504. Later that year, Dow attended the 1888 Prohibition Party National Convention in Indianapolis. In a break from his erstwhile contempt for the former Confederacy, Dow called for sectional unity and &quot;no more waving of the bloody shirt&quot;. He also spoke against the political expediency of the party backing women&#x27;s suffrage, although he personally endorsed the idea.

Cornelia Dow had died in 1883, but Dow&#x27;s unmarried daughter, also named Cornelia, lived with him and assisted in temperance causes. In 1891, his son Frederick and his family moved in as well. Frederick remained active in his father&#x27;s former Republican Party and was the editor of the &quot;Portland Evening Express&quot;. Despite a fall from a horse in 1890, Dow continued in good health, reading and writing about his signature issue, but travelling less. On his ninetieth birthday in 1894, a large crowd gathered to celebrate him and his life&#x27;s work. In 1895, he gave his final public speech, criticizing the city government for not enforcing the prohibition laws. He began to write his memoirs, &quot;The Reminiscences of Neal Dow: Recollections of Eighty Years&quot;, but died on October 2, 1897, before completing the book. Dow&#x27;s body lay in state at the Second Parish Church in Portland before being buried in that city&#x27;s Evergreen Cemetery. He had seen the rise of the prohibition movement and, as biographer Frank L. Byrne notes, proselytized the cause &quot;more than any man of the 19th century&quot;.

<doc id="392872" wikidata="Q230566" url="?curid=392872" title="Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies">
<text>Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies (, ; 27 April 1806 – 22 August 1878) was the Queen of Spain from 1829 to 1833 and Queen regent of the kingdom from 1833, when her daughter became queen at age two, to 1840. By virtue of her short marriage to King Ferdinand VII of Spain, she became a central character in Spanish history for nearly 50 years, thanks to introducing a bicameral model of government based on the Bourbon Restoration in France: the Spanish Royal Statute of 1834.

==Early life==
Born in Palermo, Sicily on 27 April 1806, she was the daughter of King Francis I of the Two Sicilies by his second wife, Maria Isabella of Spain.

==Queen of Spain==
On 27 May 1829, Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony, the third wife of King Ferdinand VII of Spain, died. Ferdinand VII, old and ill, had not sired a male heir, sparking a succession duel between the Infanta Maria Francisca and the Infante Carlos, and the Infanta Luisa Carlotta and the Infante Francisco de Paula. Ferdinand VII declared his intention to marry and assembled the Council of Castile, who tasked the King with remarriage. Following Luisa Carlotta&#x27;s suggestion, Ferdinand VII sent for Maria Christina, his niece, who pleased the King&#x27;s eyes. The two were wed on 12 December 1829 at the Basilica of Nuestra Señora de Atocha.

With her betrothal and then marriage to Ferdinand VII, Maria Christina became embroiled in the conflict between the Spanish Liberals and the Carlists. The former faction, and the Spanish people, greatly revered Maria Christina, and made her their champion; when she first arrived in Madrid in 1829, the blue of the cloak she wore became their official color. The latter were absolutists and highly conservative, and derived their name from the Carlos&#x27;s, who they favored for the throne. Using King Philip V&#x27;s enactment of Salic law, which banned women from taking the throne, Maria Francisca and Carlos pushed for the latter&#x27;s claim. Ferdinand VII and Maria Christina produced two daughters, Isabella on 10 October 1830 and Luisa Fernanda a little over a year later on 30 January 1832. However, in a secret session of the &quot;Cortes&quot; in 1789, King Charles IV reversed this law with the Pragmatic Sanction. Seeking to secure the succession of an heir of his siring, no matter their gender, Ferdinand VII announced the Pragmatic Sanction in March 1830.

In July 1832, Maria Christina, Ferdinand VII, their daughters, Maria Francisca and Carlos, and Maria Teresa, Princess of Beira, set out for the Royal Palace of La Granja. On the trip to La Granja, Ferdinand VII was badly injured by a coach accident. He became ill and increasingly sick over the summer. At one point, Ferdinand VII was found unconscious at the palace chapel. Seeking counsel in the event of Ferdinand VII&#x27;s death, Maria approached the Carlist Francisco Calomarde, who advised her that the Spanish people would rally behind Carlos. Acting on this, she coerced Ferdinand VII into signing a decree making her regent if he died, with Carlos as her chief adviser. Carlos refused, demanding total governance. Calomarde, with Maria Francisca and Maria Theresa, reissued his warning, coercing King and Queen into repealing the Pragmatic Sanction. When Ferdinand VII appeared to have died, the repealing was announced publicly, and Maria Christina deserted by her courtiers. Ferdinand VII was discovered to be alive, and news of this also spread. Luisa Carlotta, at that time in Andalusia, soon arrived at La Granja and speedily persuaded Ferdinand to re-enact the Pragmatic Sanction and orchestrated Calomarde&#x27;s dismissal.

==Regency==
When Ferdinand died on 29 September 1833, Maria Christina became regent for their daughter Isabella. Isabella&#x27;s claim to the throne was disputed by Carlos, who claimed that his brother Ferdinand had unlawfully changed the succession law to permit females to inherit the crown again (see Carlism). Some supporters of Don Carlos went so far as to claim that Ferdinand had actually bequeathed the crown to his brother but that Maria Christina had suppressed that fact. It was further alleged that the Queen had signed her dead husband&#x27;s name to a decree recognizing Isabella as heir.

Carlos&#x27; attempt to seize power resulted in the First Carlist War. Despite considerable support for Carlos from conservative elements in Spain, Cristina&#x27;s side (also known as &quot;Isabelinos&quot;) successfully retained the throne for her daughter.

===Downfall===
On 28 December 1833, shortly after the death of Ferdinand VII, Maria Christina secretly married an ex-sergeant from the royal guard, Agustín Fernando Muñoz (1808–1873). Maria Christina and Muñoz had several children together while trying to keep their marriage a secret.

* Maria de los Desamparados, Countess of Vista Alegre (17 November 1834 - 19 August 1864); married Prince Władysław Czartoryski (1828–1894).
* Maria de los Milagros, Marchioness of Castillejo (8 November 1835 – 9 July 1903); married (1824–1913). Their fourth son Giovanni Battista was known as the Prince del Drago in New York society.
* Agustín Maria, 1st Duke of Tarancón (15 March 1837 - 15 July 1855)
* Fernando Maria, 2nd Duke of Riansares and Tarancon (27 April 1838 – 7 December 1910); married Eladia Bernaldo de Quirós y González de Cienfuegos (1839–1909).
* Maria Cristina, Marchioness of La Isabella (19 April 1840 – 19 December 1921). 
* Juan Bautista, Count of Recuerdo (29 August 1841 – 2 April 1863)
* Antonio Muñoz y de Borbón (3 November 1842 – 1847)
* Jose Maria, Count of Gracia (21 December 1843 – 17 December 1863)
Muñoz enlisted in the royal bodyguard, and attracted the attention of Maria Christina. According to one account, he distinguished himself by stopping the runaway horses of her carriage; according to another, he only picked up her handkerchief; a third, scandalous explanation of his fortune has been given. Maria Christina&#x27;s husband, King Ferdinand VII of Spain died on 29 September 1833, and on 28 December 1833 she and Muñoz were privately married.

If Maria Christina had officially made the marriage public, she would have forfeited the regency; but her relations with Muñoz were perfectly well known within the Spanish court. When on 13 August 1836 the soldiers on duty at the La Granja summer palace mutinied and forced the regent to grant a constitution, it was generally, though wrongly, believed that they overcame her reluctance by seizing Muñoz, whom they called her &quot;guapo&quot;, or fancy man, and threatening to shoot him.

Eventually, news of Maria Christina&#x27;s marriage to this low-ranking soldier became public. That news made Maria Christina deeply unpopular. Her position was undermined by news of her remarriage and concerns that she was not actually supportive of her liberal ministers and their policies. Eventually, the army, which was the backbone of Isabella II&#x27;s support, and the liberal leadership in the Cortes combined to demand that Maria Christina stand aside from the regency. In 1840 Maria Christina found her position intolerable; she renounced the regency and left Spain with Muñoz. The army commander, General Baldomero Espartero, replaced her as regent.

==Exile==

In 1842 Maria Christina purchased the Château de Malmaison as her residence. In 1843, on the overthrow of General Baldomero Espartero she returned to Spain with her husband. In 1844, Muñoz&#x27;s stepdaughter Queen Isabella II was declared to be of age. On 23 June 1844 Isabella gave to Muñoz the title &quot;Duque de Riánsares&quot;, to which was attached a Grandeza de España; the title came from the River Riánsares, near Muñoz&#x27;s birthplace in Tarancón. On 12 October 1844 Isabella gave official consent to the marriage between her mother and Muñoz, and it was publicly performed. In 1846 Isabella made Muñoz a Knight of the Golden Fleece. On 30 May 1846 she gave Muñoz a second title, &quot;Marqués de San Agustín&quot;. Muñoz was made a Captain General, the highest rank in the Spanish Army. In 1847 Louis Philippe, King of the French, gave Muñoz the title &quot;Duc de Montmorot&quot;; he also invested Muñoz with the Grand Cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 1854, Maria Christina left for France a second time. France remained her primary residence for the remainder of her life.

==Death and burial==
Maria Christina&#x27;s illness returned and she suffered from serious coughing, fainting and fever. She died in Le Havre, France on 22 August 1878. As the mother of Isabella II and consort of Ferdinand VII, Maria Christina was buried in the royal crypt of El Escorial.

<doc id="392874" wikidata="Q2565413" url="?curid=392874" title="Hidden node problem">
<text>In wireless networking, the hidden node problem or hidden terminal problem occurs when a node can communicate with a wireless access point (AP), but cannot directly communicate with other nodes that are communicating with that AP. This leads to difficulties in medium access control sublayer since multiple nodes can send data packets to the AP simultaneously, which creates interference at the AP resulting in no packet getting through.

Although some loss of packets is normal in wireless networking, and the higher layers will resend them, if one of the nodes is transferring a lot of large packets over a long period, the other node may get very little goodput.

Practical protocol solutions exist to the hidden node problem. For example, Request To Send/Clear To Send (RTS/CTS) mechanisms where nodes send short packets to request permission of the access point to send longer data packets. As responses from the AP are seen by all the nodes, the nodes can synchronize their transmissions to not interfere. However, the mechanism introduces latency, and the overhead can often be greater than the cost, particularly for short data packets.

==Background==
Hidden nodes in a wireless network are nodes that are out of range of other nodes or a collection of nodes. Consider a physical star topology with an access point with many nodes surrounding it in a circular fashion: each node is within communication range of the AP, but the nodes cannot communicate with each other.

For example, in a wireless network, it is likely that the node at the far edge of the access point&#x27;s range, which is known as A, can see the access point, but it is unlikely that the same node can communicate with a node on the opposite end of the access point&#x27;s range, C. These nodes are known as &quot;hidden&quot;.

Another example would be where A and C are either side of an obstacle that reflects or strongly absorbs radio waves, but nevertheless they can both still see the same AP.

The problem is when nodes A and C start to send packets simultaneously to the access point B. As the nodes A and C cannot receive each other&#x27;s signals, so they cannot detect the collision before or while transmitting, carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) does not work, and collisions occur, which then corrupt the data received by the access point.

To overcome the hidden node problem, request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) handshaking (IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS) is implemented at the Access Point in conjunction with the Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme. The same problem exists in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET).

IEEE 802.11 uses 802.11 RTS/CTS acknowledgment and handshake packets to partly overcome the hidden node problem. RTS/CTS is not a complete solution and may decrease throughput even further, but adaptive acknowledgements from the base station can help too.

The comparison with hidden stations shows that RTS/CTS packages in each traffic class are profitable (even with short audio frames, which cause a high overhead on RTS/CTS frames).

In the experimental environment following traffic classes are included: data (not time critical), data (time critical), video, audio. Examples for notations: (0|0|0|2) means 2 audio stations; (1|1|2|0) means 1 data station (not time critical), 1 data station (time critical), 2 video stations.

The other methods that can be employed to solve hidden node problem are : 
*Increase transmitting power from the nodes
*Use omnidirectional antennas
*Remove obstacles
*Move the node
*Use protocol enhancement software
*Use antenna diversity

Increasing the transmission power of the nodes can solve the hidden node problem by allowing the cell around each node to increase in size, encompassing all of the other nodes. This configuration enables the non-hidden nodes to detect, or hear, the hidden node. If the non-hidden nodes can hear the hidden node, the hidden node is no longer hidden. As wireless LANs use the CSMA/CA protocol, nodes will wait their turn before communicating with the access point.

This solution only works if one increases the transmission power on nodes that are hidden. In the typical case of a WiFi network, increasing transmission power on the access point only will not solve the problem because typically the hidden nodes are the clients (e.g. laptops, mobile devices), not the access point itself, and the clients will still not be able to hear each other. Increasing transmission power on the access point is actually likely to make the problem worse, because it will put new clients in range of the access point and thus add new nodes to the network that are hidden from other clients.

=== Omnidirectional antennas ===
Since nodes using directional antennas are nearly invisible to nodes that are not positioned in the direction the antenna is aimed at, directional antennas should be used only for very small networks (e.g., dedicated point-to-point connections). Use omnidirectional antennas for widespread networks consisting of more than two nodes.

=== Removing obstacles ===
Increasing the power on mobile nodes may not work if, for example, the reason one node is hidden is that there is a concrete or steel wall preventing communication with other nodes. It is doubtful that one would be able to remove such an obstacle, but removal of the obstacle is another method of remedy for the hidden node problem.

=== Moving the node ===
Another method of solving the hidden node problem is moving the nodes so that they can all hear each other. If it is found that the hidden node problem is the result of a user moving his computer to an area that is hidden from the other wireless nodes, it may be necessary to have that user move again. The alternative to forcing users to move is extending the wireless LAN to add proper coverage to the hidden area, perhaps using additional access points.

=== Protocol enhancement ===
There are several software implementations of additional protocols that essentially implement a polling or token passing strategy. Then, a master (typically the access point) dynamically polls clients for data. Clients are not allowed to send data without the master&#x27;s invitation. This eliminates the hidden node problem at the cost of increased latency and less maximum throughput.

The Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS is one handshake protocol that is used. Clients that wish to send data send an RTS frame, the access point then sends a CTS frame when it is ready for that particular node. For short packets the overhead is quite large, so short packets do not usually use it, the minimum size is generally configurable.

=== Cell network ===
With cellular networks the hidden node problem has practical solutions by time domain multiplexing for each given client for a mast, and using spatially diverse transmitters, so that each node is potentially served by any of three masts to greatly minimise issues with obstacles interfering with radio propagation.

<doc id="392876" wikidata="Q7842104" url="?curid=392876" title="Trilon">
<text>A trilon is a three-faceted prism-shaped object.

A trilon can be made to rotate on an axle to show different text or images which may be applied to any of its three facets. Trilons have been used on game shows and billboards.

The game board on the original &quot;Concentration&quot; may have been the first use of trilons on a game show. The game combined the card game with a rebus puzzle. The original game board consisted of 30 motorized trilons. One facet of each trilon had an identifying number. A description of a prize or other game element was on a second facet, and a portion of a rebus was on the third facet. The rebus was gradually revealed as the game progressed. Puzzle pieces were kept under high security and were attached to the trilons only as needed.

Trilons became a common element on many other game (and reality) shows including:
*&quot;Three on a Match&quot;, which used a board with three columns of four trilons each, but unlike &quot;Concentration&quot;, these trilons rotated vertically rather than horizontally.
*Several incarnations of the &quot;Pyramid&quot; series (exceptions were the main game board in 1990 and all boards in the 2002 and 2012 versions).
*The main game in the game show &quot;Whew!&quot;
*The first season of &quot;Street Smarts&quot;. 
*The spaces on the letter board in &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; were trilons until 1997. 
*The entire game board on the original &quot;Family Feud&quot; was one large trilon through 1994. One side was itself composed of smaller trilons that could display individual answers during a round.
*The board used in the Hidden Pictures rounds on the syndicated version of the Nickelodeon game show &quot;Finders Keepers&quot;. 
*The &quot;Jailtime Challenge&quot; round of &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; used a game board with 15 trilons that, like those on &quot;Three on a Match&quot;, rotated vertically.
*The game show &quot;Debt&quot; had a game board with thirty trilons during its first season. 
*Several pricing games featured in &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, such as Bargain Game, Hot Seat and One Away. 
*The live competitions on the American version of &quot;Big Brother&quot;.

Mechanically speaking, trilons had a penchant for being temperamental, labor-intensive, and very noisy. They were largely replaced by on-set television monitors, as on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; (starting with the 1984 revival, although pull-cards were used instead of trilons to show the categories until 1991). They were replaced by a CGI game board on the 1987 &quot;Classic&quot; revival of &quot;Concentration&quot; and &quot;Family Feud&quot; (starting with the 1999 revival).

Trilons have been used in roadside billboards and variable-message signs. Particularly in billboards, many long, thin trilons are placed side-by-side in the frame and periodically rotate simultaneously to cycle the billboard through three separate signs, although many have been replaced by dot-matrix signs capable of displaying a much wider range of messages.

<doc id="392879" wikidata="Q3293251" url="?curid=392879" title="Bellamy salute">
<text>The Bellamy salute is a palm-out salute created by James B. Upham as the gesture that was to accompany the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States of America, whose text had been written by Francis Bellamy. It was also known as the &quot;flag salute&quot; during the period when it was used with the Pledge of Allegiance. Bellamy promoted the salute and it came to be associated with his name. Both the Pledge and its salute originated in 1892. Later, during the 1920s and 1930s, Italian fascists and Nazi Germans adopted a salute which was very similar, which originated with the so-called Roman salute, a gesture that may have been used in ancient Rome. This resulted in controversy over the use of the Bellamy salute in the United States. It was replaced with saluting the flag by extending the right hand over the heart when Congress amended the &quot;Flag Code&quot; on December 22, 1942.

== History ==
The inventor of the Bellamy salute was James B. Upham, junior partner and editor of &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot;. Bellamy recalled that Upham, upon reading the pledge, came into the posture of the salute, snapped his heels together, and said, &quot;Now up there is the flag; I come to salute; as I say &#x27;I pledge allegiance to my flag&#x27;, I stretch out my right hand and keep it raised while I say the stirring words that follow.&quot; By the time the official program was published, the Bellamy salute would begin with a traditional military salute as the first words of the pledge were spoken. 

The Bellamy salute was first demonstrated on October 21, 1892, according to Bellamy&#x27;s published instructions for the &quot;National School Celebration of Columbus Day&quot; as the &quot;400th Anniversary of the Discovery of America&quot;. Note, the Presidential Proclamation called for this special, national holiday to take place on Friday, October 21 rather than October 12. Waiting nine additional days accounted for all but two of the days which had been skipped in 1752 moving the United States from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. The goal was to mark a full 400 years passing with a true work holiday, thus avoiding events falling on Saturday/Sunday. With an already established tradition celebrating Columbus&#x27;s having landed on October 12, New York City opted to schedule three special parades and several VIP celebrations with their events taking place on October 11, 12 and 13, 1892.

From &quot;The Official Programme&quot; regarding the planned flag salute:

In the 1920s, Italian fascists adopted the Roman salute to symbolize their claim to have revitalized Italy on the model of ancient Rome. A similar ritual was adopted by the German Nazis, creating the Nazi salute. Controversy grew in the United States on the use of the Bellamy salute given its similarity to the fascist salutes. School boards around the country revised the salute to avoid this similarity. There was a counter-backlash from the United States Flag Association and the Daughters of the American Revolution, who felt it inappropriate for Americans to have to change the traditional salute because foreigners had later adopted a similar gesture.

From 1939 until the attack on Pearl Harbor, critics of Americans who argued against intervention in World War II produced propaganda using the salute to lessen those Americans&#x27; reputations. Among the anti-interventionist Americans was aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh. The pictures of him appearing to do the Nazi salute are actually pictures of him using the Bellamy salute. In his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography &quot;Lindbergh&quot; (1998), author A. Scott Berg explains that interventionist propagandists would photograph Lindbergh and other isolationists using this salute from an angle that left out the American flag, so it would be indistinguishable to observers from the Nazi salute.

On June 22, 1942, at the urging of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Congress passed , which codified the etiquette used to display and pledge allegiance to the flag. This included the use of a palm-out salute, specifically that the pledge &quot;be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart; extending the right hand, palm upward, toward the flag at the words &#x27;to the flag&#x27; and holding this position until the end, when the hand drops to the side.&quot; Congress did not discuss or take into account the controversy over use of the salute. Congress later amended the code on December 22, 1942, when it passed , stating among other changes, that the pledge &quot;be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart.&quot;

<doc id="392885" wikidata="Q725340" url="?curid=392885" title="Ashigaru">
<text>were infantry employed by the samurai class of feudal Japan. The first known reference to &quot;ashigaru&quot; was in the 14th century, but it was during the Ashikaga shogunate (Muromachi period) that the use of &quot;ashigaru&quot; became prevalent by various warring factions.

==Origins==
Attempts were made in Japan by Emperor Tenmu (673–686) to have a conscripted national army, but this did not come about, and by the 10th century Japan instead relied on individual landowners to provide men for conflicts and wars. These horse-owning landowners were the beginnings of the samurai class and the men who worked the land for the landowners became the common foot soldiers during times of war. These foot soldiers could have long ties and loyalty to the landowners which went back many generations.

Land-owning samurai, together with farmer foot soldiers, fought in many wars and conflicts including the Mongol invasions of Japan in 1274 and 1281. Constant warfare between the 14th and 16th centuries made the hiring of foot soldiers with no particular loyalty necessary at times. Paid only in loot, these mercenaries were not well-trained and thus could not always be depended upon in battle. These wandering foot soldiers eventually became the &quot;ashigaru&quot;.

==Weapons and armor==
Ashigaru were commonly armed with &quot;katana&quot;, &quot;yari&quot;, and &quot;yumi&quot;. Ashigaru armour varied depending on the period, from no armor to heavily armored and could consist of conical hats called &quot;jingasa&quot; made from iron, copper, wood, paper, bamboo, or leather, &quot;dō&quot; (cuirasses), &quot;kabuto&quot; (helmets), &quot;tatami zukin&quot; (armored hoods), &quot;kote&quot; (armored sleeves), &quot;suneate&quot; (greaves), and &quot;haidate&quot; (cuisses).

The warfare of the Sengoku period (15th and 16th centuries) required large quantities of armor to be produced for the ever-growing armies of ashigaru. Simple munition armour cuirasses and helmets were mass-produced including armor which could be folded or were collapsible. &quot;Tatami&quot; armor was made from small rectangular or hexagonal iron plates that were usually connected to each other by mail and sewn to a cloth backing.

In the 16th century the ashigaru were also armed with matchlocks of the type known as &quot;tanegashima&quot;. Small banners called &quot;sashimono&quot; could be worn on their backs during battle for identification.

==Service in war==

In the Ōnin War, ashigaru gained a reputation as unruly troops when they looted and burned Miyako (modern-day Kyoto). In the following Sengoku period the aspect of the battle changed from single combat to massed formations. Therefore, ashigaru became the backbone of many feudal armies and some of them rose to greater prominence.

Those who were given control of ashigaru were called . The most famous of them was Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who also raised many of his warrior followers to samurai status.

==Introduction to firearms and new tactics==
Ashigaru formed the backbone of samurai armies in the later periods. The real change for the ashigaru began in 1543 with the introduction of matchlock firearms by the Portuguese. Almost immediately local &quot;daimyōs&quot; started to equip their ashigaru with the new weapon, which required little training to use proficiently, as compared with the longbow, which took many years to learn. As battles became more complex and forces larger, ashigaru were rigorously trained so that they would hold their ranks in the face of enemy fire.

The advantage of the matchlock guns proved decisive to samurai warfare. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, where carefully positioned ashigaru gunners of the Oda and Tokugawa clans thwarted the Takeda clan&#x27;s repeated heavy cavalry charges against the Oda clan&#x27;s defensive lines and broke the back of the Takeda war machine.

After the battle, the ashigaru&#x27;s role in the armies was cemented as a very powerful complement to the samurai. The advantage was used in the two invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597 against the Koreans and later the Ming-dynasty Chinese. Though the ratio of guns (matchlocks) to bows was 2:1 during the first invasion, the ratio became 4:1 in the second invasion since the guns proved highly effective.

==Discontinuation of conscription==
Following the rise of the Tokugawa shogunate, the conscription of ashigaru fell into disuse. Since ashigarus&#x27; change to the professional soldier was advanced after Oda Nobunaga, the ashigaru gradually separated from the farmer.

When entering the Edo period, the ashigaru&#x27;s position was fixed and the use of conscripts was abandoned for over two hundred years in Japan. Ashigaru were considered to be the lowest rung of the samurai class in some han (domains), but not in others.

<text>Urban structure is the arrangement of land use in urban areas, in other words, how the land use of a city is set out. Urban planners, economists, and geographers have developed several models that explain where different types of people and businesses tend to exist within the urban setting. Urban structure can also refer to urban spatial structure, which concerns the arrangement of public and private space in cities and the degree of connectivity and accessibility.

==Zonal model==
This model was the first to explain distribution of social groups within urban areas. Based on one single city, Chicago, it was created by sociologist Ernest Burgess in 1924. According to this model, a city grows outward from a central point in a series of concentric rings. The innermost ring represents the central business district. It is surrounded by a second ring, the zone of transition, which contains industry and poorer-quality housing. The third ring contains housing for the working-class and is called the zone of independent workers&#x27; homes. The fourth ring has newer and larger houses usually occupied by the middle-class. This ring is called the zone of better residences. The outermost ring is called the commuter&#x27;s zone. This zone represents people who choose to live in residential suburbs and take a daily commute into the CBD to work.

==Sectoral model==
A second theory of urban structure was proposed in 1939 by an economist named Homer Hoyt. His model, the sector model, proposed that a city develops in sectors instead of rings. Certain areas of a city are more attractive for various activities, whether by chance or geographic and environmental reasons. As the city grows and these activities flourish and expand outward, they do so in a wedge and become a sector of the city. If a district is set up for high income housing, for example, any new development in that district will expand from the outer edge.

To some degree this theory is just a refinement on the concentric model rather than a radical restatement. Both Hoyt and Burgess claimed Chicago supported their model. Burgess claimed that Chicago&#x27;s central business district was surrounded by a series of rings, broken only by Lake Michigan. Hoyt argued that the best housing developed north from the central business district along Lake Michigan, while industry located along major rail lines and roads to the south, southwest, and northwest.

Calgary, Alberta almost perfectly fits Hoyt&#x27;s sector model.

==Multiple nuclei model==

Geographers Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullman developed the multiple nuclei model in 1945. According to this model, a city contains more than one center around which activities revolve. Some activities are attracted to particular nodes while others try to avoid them. For example, a university node may attract well-educated residents, pizzerias, and bookstores, whereas an airport may attract hotels and warehouses. Other businesses may also form clusters, sometimes known locally as s for automobile repair or red light districts for prostitution, or arts districts. Incompatible activities will avoid clustering in the same area, explaining why heavy industry and high-income housing rarely exist in the same neighbourhood.

<doc id="392900" wikidata="Q1972926" url="?curid=392900" title="Sloe gin">
<text>Sloe gin is a British red liqueur made with gin and blackthorn fruits (sloes), which are the drupe fruit of the &quot;Prunus spinosa&quot; tree, which is a relative of the plum. As an alcoholic drink, sloe gin contains between 15 per cent and 30 per cent alcohol by volume (ABV); however, European Union regulations established 25 per cent ABV as the minimal alcoholic content for the blackthorn beverage to be a &quot;sloe gin&quot;. Historically, despite being a liqueur based upon gin, the EU included the colloquial name &quot;sloe gin&quot; to the legal definitions; thus, sloe gin is the only alcoholic beverage that legally uses the term &quot;gin&quot; without appending the &quot;liqueur&quot; suffix.

The traditional method of preparation of sloe gin is to soak the blackthorns (sloes) in gin with some sugar, and the mixture sweetens when the blackthorn fruit mature in the alcohol. Commercial sloe gin is made by flavouring an inexpensive neutral grain spirit. US distilleries use close fruits related to the blackthorn, such as the beach plum and the Aronia berry, to produce American versions of the British sloe gin.

==Manufacture==
Sloe gin is made from ripe sloes, which are traditionally picked after the first frost of winter (late October to early November in the northern hemisphere). Each sloe is pricked, traditionally with a thorn taken from the blackthorn bush on which they grow. An alternative folktale says that one should not prick the sloes with a metal fork unless it is made of silver. A modern variation is to pick the sloes earlier and freeze them overnight, to mimic the effects of frost.

A wide-necked jar is filled half way with pricked sloes, and of sugar is added for each imperial pint () of sloes. The jar is then filled with gin, sealed, turned several times to mix and stored in a cool, dark place. It is turned every day for the first two weeks, then each week, until at least three months have passed.

The gin will now have a deep ruby red colour. The liqueur is poured off and the sloes discarded, or infused in white wine or cider, made into jam, or used as a basis for a chutney or a filling for liqueur chocolates. The liqueur can be filtered or decanted back into clean containers and left to stand for another week. Careful decanting can eliminate almost all sediment, leaving a red liqueur that is not cloudy.

Recipes for sloe gin vary depending on the maker&#x27;s taste. The sweetness can be adjusted to taste at the end of the process, although sufficient sugar is required while the fruit is steeped to ensure full extraction of flavour. When made sufficiently slowly, the alcohol extracts an almond-like essence from the sloes&#x27; stones, giving sloe gin a particular aromatic flavour. However, some recipes use a shorter steeping time and include a small amount of almond essence. Another common variation is the addition of a few cloves and a small stick of cinnamon.

In North Yorkshire, Masons Gin distills the sloe berries in the gin as opposed to the traditional infusing the berries in the gin after distillation.

==UK competitions==
A sloe gin competition is held each January in The Pandy Inn, Dorstone, Herefordshire, with the winner crowned the &quot;Grand Master of the Sloes&quot;. There were 30 Sloe Gins entered in the 2015 competition. They were sampled and scored on colour, clarity, taste and quality by more than 50 judges.

There are also the Sloe Gin Awards in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, which are held annually and include gold, silver and bronze awards.

The George Inn in Frant, East Sussex, near Royal Tunbridge Wells, plays host to the annual Sloe Gin World Championships in December.

==Related liqueurs==
In Germany and other German-speaking countries, Schlehenlikör (de) is made by soaking sloes, sugar, and possibly some spices in vodka, gin or rum. The most popular commercial brand, , based on white rum, is made by , better known for its product .

In Spain, is made by soaking sloes in an anise-flavoured spirit, resulting in a light reddish-brown, sweet liquid, around 25–30% alcohol by volume.

In Italy, is made by soaking sloes with sugar and spices in spirit alcohol (recipe varies locally), resulting a reddish, sweet liquor, around 40–45% alcohol by volume; it is often chilled before serving.

In Poland, is an infusion () of sloes in vodka or rectified spirit.
Slider is still cider in which the sloes used to make sloe gin have been steeped; it is a tradition of Devonshire in the UK. Sloe whisky and sloe brandy are variants on the tradition, and are often mixed with ginger beer or ginger ale.

<doc id="392902" wikidata="Q1475020" url="?curid=392902" title="Furman University">
<text>Furman University is a private university in Greenville, South Carolina, United States. Founded in 1826 and named after Baptist pastor Richard Furman, the liberal arts university is the oldest private institution of higher learning in South Carolina. It became a secular university in 1992, while keeping &quot;Christo et Doctrinae&quot; (For Christ and Learning) as its motto. As of Fall 2021, it enrolls approximately 2,300 undergraduate students and 150 graduate students on its campus.

==History==
===Beginnings (19th century)===
Furman Academy and Theological Institution was established by the South Carolina Baptist Convention and incorporated in December 1825 in Edgefield. With 10 students, it held its first classes January 15, 1828; although another source says it opened in January 1827. Through 1850, average enrollment was 10 students, and it was at constant risk of insolvency. From 1829 to 1834, it operated in the High Hills of the Santee (now Stateburg, South Carolina). Furman closed from 1834 to 1837. When the school reopened, at the urging of the Reverend Jonathan Davis, chairman of the Board of Agents, the school moved to his native Fairfield County, near Winnsboro.

In 1850, the state legislature chartered Furman University. It was not until 1851 that South Carolina Baptists were able to raise the necessary funds for the removal of the school to Greenville, South Carolina.

The university closed from 1861 to 1866, when &quot;most students and several faculty members enlisted in the Confederate forces.&quot;

The Furman Institution Faculty Residence serves as a visible reminder of the early history of Furman University and its brief establishment in Fairfield County.

===Growth and expansion (20th century)===
The first school building from the downtown Greenville campus was transported to the current campus, where it still stands. In 1933, students from the Greenville Women&#x27;s College began attending classes with Furman students. Shortly thereafter, the two schools merged to form the present institution.

In 1924, Furman was named one of four collegiate beneficiaries of the Duke Endowment. Through 2007, Furman has received $110 million from the endowment, which is now one of the nation&#x27;s largest philanthropic foundations. Three other colleges—Duke, Davidson and Johnson C. Smith—also receive annual support and special grants from the endowment.

In 1954, &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; found the &quot;separate but equal&quot; policy to be unconstitutional, starting the lengthy process of desegregating public schools. As of that date, Furman, like most Southern colleges, did not accept African Americans as students. Some Furman students began to press for change. In 1955, some students wrote short stories and poems in &quot;The Echo&quot;, a student literary magazine, in support of integration; school administrators destroyed all 1,500 printed copies. In 1953, Furman began construction on its new campus, north of downtown Greenville. Classes on the new campus began in 1958.

By 1963, enough faculty were siding with the students over racial desegregation that Furman&#x27;s board of trustees voted to admit Black students. Action on the trustees&#x27; decision was postponed and it was later overturned by South Carolina&#x27;s Baptist Convention; desegregated admission was not implemented at Furman until its incoming president, Gordon W. Blackwell, a past president of Florida State University, made it a condition of his acceptance of the new position. In 1965, Joe Vaughn was the first black undergraduate to enroll.

In 1992, the South Carolina Baptist Convention ended its affiliation with Furman. Furman&#x27;s &quot;heritage is rooted in the non-creedal, free church Baptist tradition which has always valued particular religious commitments while insisting not only on the freedom of the individual to believe as he or she sees fit but also on respect for a diversity of religious perspectives, including the perspective of the non-religious person.&quot;

===21st century===
In 2012, a new facility, named for alumni Sarah and Gordon Herring, was built for continuing education. The student center was expanded and renovated in 2012. David Trone, a Furman alumnus, together with his wife June, participated through a $3.5 million gift resulting in the center being named the Trone Student Center.

In October 2018, a Task Force on Slavery and Justice, set up by Provost George Shields, issued a report, &quot;Seeking Abraham&quot;, making recommendations &quot;to acknowledge the role slavery and racism had in the school&#x27;s history.&quot; The task force is a response to the article, &quot;Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation: What is the Furman Legacy?&quot;, published in October 2016 in the university newspaper, pointing out that Richard Furman, the university&#x27;s namesake, and even more so his son James Clement Furman, Furman&#x27;s first president, were slave owners and active defenders of slavery. &quot;Abraham&quot; is a reference to Abraham Sims, a slave at the house of James Furman. The task force issued 19 recommendations, which were unanimously accepted by Furman&#x27;s board of trustees. James C. Furman Hall will be renamed Furman Hall, and a statue will be erected to honor Joseph Vaughn, &quot;the first Black student to attend the school&quot;.

==Campus==

Furman University&#x27;s campus is located at the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the upstate region of South Carolina.

Furman&#x27;s campus has been named one of the most beautiful campuses in the nation. In 2016, &quot;USA Today&quot; named Furman&#x27;s campus as the 4th most beautiful campus out of 10. &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; named it ninth out of the ten most beautiful campuses in the nation in 2017. In 2019, &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; listed Furman as 23rd out of 25 of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.

===Timmons Arena===
Timmons Arena is a 4,000-seat multi-purpose arena. It is home to the Furman University Paladins basketball team since its opening on December 30, 1997.

===Cliffs Cottage===
A &quot;Southern Living&quot; showcase home called Cliffs Cottage opened in 2008. The building is solar-powered using two panels, and features geothermal heating.

<doc id="392903" wikidata="Q1047716" url="?curid=392903" title="List of political parties in Romania">
<text>This article lists political parties in Romania. Romania has a democratic multi-party system with numerous political parties, in which a political party does not often have the chance of gaining parliamentary majority alone, and, thus, parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. The current system was established following the Romanian Revolution of 1989 and the adoption of a new constitution in 1991; prior to these events, Romania was a single-party state under the rulership of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR).

Since the early 1990s, Romanian politics saw a gradual decrease in the number of political parties entering the Parliament and a relative consolidation of existing ones along ideological lines. Major political parties can be roughly grouped into three main &quot;families&quot;, more specifically liberal, social democratic, or conservative. Extremist groups have a relatively low political profile in Romania, despite a surge in popularity of far-right and Eurosceptic political parties across many European Union (EU) countries during the 2010s.

Party switching () remains a very concerning and significant issue, however, as does widespread corruption, leading to an overall low level of public trust in political parties. In December 2014 the level of trust stood at 12%. To counter this perception, the two largest parties as of 2015 (namely the Social Democrats and the National Liberals) have allegedly initiated a series of internal reforms to strengthen their integrity criteria and impose disciplinary sanctions on party members investigated or convicted on corruption charges.

==Legal framework==
Article 40 of the Constitution of Romania states that citizens can freely associate into political parties, with the exception of judges, military, and police personnel as well as other civil servants which are apolitical by law. The same article bans political parties which campaign against political pluralism, the rule of law, and Romania&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Romania&#x27;s party system is regulated by Law no. 14/2003 on political parties; the law initially mandated a list of 25,000 supporters, residing in at least 18 counties and the Municipality of Bucharest, for a political party to be formally registered.

Nevertheless, in February 2015, the unregistered Pirate Party of Romania () filed a complaint to the Constitutional Court, arguing that the list requirement is a violation of the constitutional provisions on freedom of association. The Court subsequently struck down the requirement as unconstitutional, and on 6 May 2015, the Romanian Parliament approved a modified version of the law, which allows the formation of a political party with 3 signatures.

== Parties represented in Parliament ==

The current political parties with parliamentary representation, in the order of the total number of representatives they hold in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, are the following ones:

In addition, ethnic minority organizations are granted each seat in the Chamber of Deputies if: (1) are the sole official representative organization of the minority; (2) they participate in the legislative election and do not pass the 5% threshold but obtain at least 10% of the number of votes calculated to correspond to electing one deputy. These seats are added to the number of seats put up for election. As of 2021, there are eighteen such seats. The Hungarian minority organization, the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ) has always passed the 5% threshold for both houses of the Romanian Parliament, and has been treated as a regular political party (and acting like one as well).

== Parties only represented in the European Parliament ==
Aside from the political parties represented in the Romanian Parliament, the following political parties only have representation in the European Parliament:

==Minor parties==

===Ethnic minority organizations===


=== Parties with elected representation at local and county level ===

The following are political parties which ran by themselves at the 2020 local elections and won elected representation at local and county level (does not include seats won on alliance tickets):

The following parties have won seats in the 2020 local elections only as part of electoral alliances:

=== Other parties ===
==Defunct parties==
=== Parties active 1859–1918 ===

===Parties active 1918−1947===

The following parties were all active in Romania in the interwar period and, in some cases, through and after World War II.
Dates of founding and dissolution are given, where known. Failing that, the earliest and latest dates known for activities are given.

This period saw the proliferation of numerous extremist parties inspired by fascism, socialism and Communism. The latter were effectively banned in 1924 by the so-called Mârzescu law. A succession of coups drastically altered the political landscape as Romania went through a single-party dictatorship under the National Renaissance Front (1938–1940), then a military dictatorship without political parties (1940–1944), then briefly returning to multiparty democracy before finally becoming a people&#x27;s republic (1944–1947).
=== Communist-era parties (1947–1989) ===

Although distinct parties in the communist era were not politically relevant, the following were the officially recognized political forces:

Other parties were allowed to exist, with unclear status, until mid 1948.

=== Post−1989 parties ===

<text>The white-faced storm petrel (Pelagodroma marina), (Māori: &quot;takahikare&quot;) also known as white-faced petrel or frigate petrel is a small seabird of the austral storm petrel family Oceanitidae. It is the only member of the monotypic genus Pelagodroma. It is widely distributed across the northern and southern hemisphere, especially around the coastal and open ocean waters of southern Australia, New Zealand, Tristan da Cunha, Cabo Verde, the Canary islands and the Selvagens islands.

==Subspecies and their distributions ==
Here are six recognised subspecies, breeding in island colonies through subtropical to subantarctic regions of the Atlantic, Indian and south-western Pacific Oceans in both hemisphere:

*&quot;P. m. albiclunis&quot; , 1951 – Kermadec Islands
*&quot;P. m. dulciae&quot; – islands off southern Australia, Houtman Abrolhos in Western Australia, east to the Broughton Islands in New South Wales and Tasmania.
*&quot;P. m. eadesi&quot; or &quot;eadoserum&quot; – Cape Verde Islands, within the North Atlantic.
*&quot;P. m. hypoleuca&quot; – Savage Islands (Selvages Islands) in the North-east Atlantic being the host the majority of the world&#x27;s population of this subspecies with only 50 pairs of breeding elsewhere. An estimate from 1996 suggested a total of 61,000 breeding pairs in the Selvagens Archipelago with 36,000 counted on Selvagem Grande alone. Other breeding spots which are Canary Islands such as Montaña Clara and Alegranza.
*&quot;P. m. maoriana&quot; – islands around New Zealand, including the Chatham, Auckland Islands and Whero Island.
*&quot;P. m. marina&quot; – Nightingale Islands, Tristan da Cunha, Inaccessible and Gough Island (Nominate subspecies).

==Description==
Commonly, the white-faced storm petrel is in length with a wingspan and 40 to 70 grams body mass. The key characteristics of this species include dark bill, tarsi, toes and claws. It has a pale brown to grey back, rump and wings with black flight feathers. It is white below, unlike other north Atlantic petrels, and has a white face with a black eye mask like a phalarope. Its distinctive grey-brown dorsal side plumage makes it one of the easier petrels to identify at sea from a distance. Both sexes of this frigate petrel have similar plumage with no seasonal variation. However, they have slight differences with females are larger than males in tarsus, wing and tail lengths by around 1 to 3%. On the other hand, males have a larger bill depth than females by about 1.7%.

While the juvenile and adult are similar, the juvenile&#x27;s fresh plumage tends to have larger light fringes and tips to upperparts feathers, and depending on the moult, it may seem grey or brown. The juvenile&#x27;s tail fork is also often shallower than the adult&#x27;s, at least in the case of the subspecies in New Zealand, &quot;P. m. maoriana&quot;.

Certain subspecies exhibit subtle differences such as a subspecies on the Kermedec Islands, &quot;P. m. albiclunis&quot; is similar like &quot;P. m. dulciae&quot; but notable for its white rump and shorter, square tail, setting it apart from &quot;P. m. dulciae&quot; and &quot;P. m. maoriana&quot; which have pale grey rumps. The &quot;P. m. albiclunis&quot; also has white upper tail coverts instead of the usual grey that make them highly distinct. Furthermore, &quot;P. m albiclunis&quot; have a bit smaller dimensions compared to those of &quot;P. m. dulciae&quot;. However, both of them display square tails and whitier face and breast sides than &quot;P. m. maoriana&quot;. In contrast, the white-faced storm petrel from New Zealand, &quot;P. m. maoriana&quot; has forked tail, characterized by the dark patches on the sides of the breast. It also has shorter culmen, tarsus and middle toe lengths with claw than other North Atlantic counterparts like &quot;P. m. dulciae&quot; and &quot;P. m. albiclunis&quot;. They also have longer tail than the average of other subspecies.

For &quot;P. m. eadesi&quot; found in Cape Verde Islands, it has slightly paler colour of plumage than the &quot;P. m. hypoleuca&quot;, with a paler forehead and hindneck. It also has a longer beak (18–20.5 mm against 16–19 mm in &quot;P. m. hypoleuca&quot;) and whiter neck sides that create an incomplete collar.

==Behaviour==
The white-faced storm petrel is strictly pelagic outside the breeding season, and this, together with its often-remote breeding sites, makes this petrel a difficult bird to see from land. Only in severe storms might this species be pushed into headlands. It is highly gregarious, but does not follow ships. This seabird burrows on both rocky slopes and flat sandy areas, favoring isolated islets for its nests. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the burrow.

===Breeding===

The white-faced storm petrel breeds on remote islands in the south Atlantic, such as Tristan da Cunha and also Australia and New Zealand. There are also north Atlantic colonies on the Cape Verde Islands, Canary Islands and Savage Islands. It nests in dense colonies close to the sea in rock crevices and lays a single white egg. The burrows are very dense especially in forested areas where vegetation such as hollyhock and grasses help stabilize the soil, reducing the potential of burrows to collapse. It spends the rest of the year at sea and strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by gulls and skuas, and will even avoid coming to land on clear moonlit nights. Other than that, to reduce the risk of predation, burrows near the edge of a colony may offer advantages as birds can land and enter their burrows faster.

The breeding period is long and varies slightly between regions. Most of the time, this seabird will return to their colonies in September or October when they clean out their burrows for Mud islands&#x27; subspecies. Then, lay the single egg in late October or November. During this period, both of the parents share incubation duties in shifts lasting 4 to 6 days with an incubation period averaging about 56 days in New Zealand colonies and about 52 days in Mud Islands. This collaborative care extends to feeding the young, which both parents do once per night. The chicks are usually abandoned shortly before fledging, occur about 52 to 67 days after hatching. Since the Mud Islands&#x27; population is a real trans-equatorial migrant, their longer travel distances to non-breeding habitats may contribute to enhanced breeding synchrony. Moreover, in these populations, breeding synchronization is frequently seen in order to capitalize on favorable climate conditions and greater food supply, which may be scarce.

High site fidelity observed in this species where many partners will stick together and use the same burrow year after year. However, this tenacity may be lower at newly established colonies like in Bass Strait. In terms of breeding cycles that highlight the asynchrony, at Mud Islands, the young typically fledged between late January and late February which is earlier than the fledging dates at Whero Island, New Zealand, about mid-February to early April. This is because Procellariform species have been shown to exhibit asynchrony, especially when they inhabit geographically separated breeding colonies. It can also be influenced by local factors like predation, habitat features or from population factors such as the quality of the bird or age structure. Overall, this species exhibits extended incubation and chick-rearing periods like other Procellariformes which further emphasizes the complexities of their breeding biology.

In some regions, white-faced storm petrels face competition for nesting sites with other seabirds. In Tasmania, studies have documented displacement by short-tailed shearwaters (&quot;Puffinus tenuirostris&quot;) from favored burrowing areas. There were also same competition have been observed on Whero Island, where the storm petrels suffered not so much from hostility by the prions, but from the fact that their nests simply happened to be in the prions&#x27; way. These interactions explain the challenges faced by these species in securing suitable nesting grounds especially when sharing habitats with larger or more dominant species.

Below is the table of different breeding cycles from different subspecies from this species:

=== Migratory ===

==== &quot;P. m. dulciae&quot; ====
Those that breed on islands from Western Australia to New South Wales mostly migrate north-west to the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean (May to July) but rarely entering Indian waters (May to September), while the migration routes of eastern colonies remain unclear. One individual breeding on Mud Islands (Victoria) was recovered 3070 km to west, and documented from east to Riau Archipelago, off northern Sumatra on October

==== &quot;P. m. eadesi&quot; ====
This subspecies of white-faced storm petrels that breed in Cape Verde shows distinct migratory pattern from previous studies. After the breeding season, they were travelling clockwise in May and June to the northwest Atlantic and then returning to Cabo Verde or Cape Verde in October and November through the northeast. Then, the birds spent the non breading season in regions connected to seamounts along the mid-Atlantic Ridge and south of the Azores.

During the non-breeding season, the species is most active at night, indicating that it benefits from the diel-vertical migration of seamount-associated nekton and zooplankton. Additionally, because of the decreased capacity to fly during the moulting season, the amount of time spent on the water before returning to the colony increased.

==== &quot;P. m. marina&quot; ====
It migrates east to Africa, reaching southern waters around South Africa, then west to South America, with data indicating that this subspecies has reached Tierra del Fuego (55°S).

=== Foraging and flight ===

White-faced storm petrels described as surface foragers because they often seen pattering on the water by stretching out their wings and using their long legs to lightly touch the water surface while maintaining flight. The use of pattering is significant in this Oceanitidae family but this species pattering almost all the time than other petrels. However, during strong wind, they move like pendulum by swinging side-to-side using their feet to push off the water, facing the wind and they will glide quickly across the water with stiff extended wings and one leg lowered when moving between feeding spots. This behaviour is influenced by their low wing loading, low foot loading and a long tarsus that contribute to the unique frequent pattering style differentiating them in flight performance. Interestingly, this species does not make extensive use of dynamic soaring to fly over the ocean surface which typically used by most other storm petrel, especially the northern storm petrels. This frequent contact with the water, combined with their foraging method, hovering with the feet briefly touching down before bounding forward, may contribute to the accumulation of gelatinous anklets on their tarsi, as observed in individuals that breed in Chatham Islands. These anklets that composed of trematode filaments could cause them entangled in vegetation. Additionally, the formation of anklets and ligaments is more frequent due to the species&#x27; foraging strategy of hovering close to the surface with their tarsi positioned closely together. Thus, it highlights the close interaction with the surface layer of the ocean while feeding, particularly in shallow waters.

They mainly travel for significant distances to forage, covering up to 400 km from their breeding colony. Observations recorded from ships indicate that they generally forage over continental shelves while sometimes venturing near the African coast and Canary Islands, particularly during chick rearing due to high productivity. During incubation, the foraging trips average around 5.1 days with more than 700 km total distance covered by this species. Meanwhile, during chick rearing, trips shorten to 3 days covering approximately 578 km to ensure consistent feeding for their chicks. For species in north-east Atlantic, they seem to travel without strong directional preferences for any well-defined foraging hotspot during incubation explaining that they are widely distributed when finding preys. Additionally, this white-faced storm petrels tend to exhibit higher travel speed at night during incubation period which suggests that they may patter less frequent and feed less time during nighttime compared to the chick-rearing period. This is because the chick rearing period is more energetically demanding and thus, resulting the birds to more likely forage at both day and night time. Therefore, it leads to similar travel speeds during both periods as they increase their efforts to provide consistent feeding for their chicks.

=== Diet ===
These white-faced petrels are opportunistic feeders in which they could consume a diverse array of prey based on availability. They will take fish offal that has been thrown overboard. They might also primarily feed at night. Studies at the Chatham Islands found the white-face storm petrels feed on a wide range of krill, amphipods, planktonic crustaceans, and small fish. Mesopelagic fish is one of their diet preferences to consume especially from Myctophidae family (FO = 71%) in the Pacific and North-east Atlantic. Meanwhile, the second biggest group diet are cephalopods (FO = 24%), most of which come from &quot;Mastigoteuthis magna&quot; species. Crustaceans like Hyperiidea and crab megalops also make up part of their diet. For the petrel subspecies that breed on Chalky Island and forage in the Bass Strait, they are also known as generalist diet with a majority of individuals are feeding on coastal krill and post-larval fish. The majority of prey are from the surface while flying or pattering, but occasionally while resting on the surface.

Interestingly, because of sexual dimorphism in which females are larger than males, they may feed their offspring larger portions. However, this may come at a higher energy cost, which could then influence the offspring&#x27;s ability to reproduce and general health. During chick rearing, since white-faced storm petrels adjust their foraging patterns to meet higher energy demands by feeding their chicks at day and night, they have been observed consuming both mesopelagic and epipelagic prey which is consistent with their dispersal throughout ocean, as mesopelagic fish are hard to access in the shallower areas. It is also indicated that the species in North Atlantic may raise their chicks primarily with mesopelagic prey because they can accumulate higher mercury concentrations than nearshore species. This diet can be proved by the mercury measurements in their feathers that showed the reliance on deeper water prey during this crucial point in life stage.

==Diseases==
White-faced storm petrels are affected by a trematode &quot;Syncoelium filiferum&quot;, which uses the krill species &quot;Nematoscelis megalops&quot; as an intermediate host. The petrels appear to be an accidental or dead-end host for the larvae of the trematode, which need to attach themselves to the gill filaments of near-surface fish to continue their life cycle. Metacercariae of &quot;S. filiferum&quot; attach using sticky filaments reaching long, which adhere to the legs of the petrel and subsequently dry out as the petrels leave the water, resulting in trematode death. The petrels can become caught in vegetation and die. This phenomenon has been described among white-faced storm petrel populations in the Chatham Islands, where it reportedly causes mortality epidemics. The trematode larvae also attach to the legs of fairy prions but do not often cause bridging leg connections in that species.

==Status and conservation==
Widespread throughout its large range, the white-faced storm petrel is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, certain regional populations have experienced significant declines due to habitat changes and other environmental pressures.

=== Threats ===

==== Mud Islands (&quot;P. m. dulciae)&quot; ====
The colony of white-faced storm petrels at Mud Islands located off the coast of Victoria, Australia has been a significant population decline over the last century. Changes in habitat, vegetation, increased pressures from other species to conquer breeding areas, and human activity have all contributed to this decline. Below is the chronology happened to the decrease of Australian white faced storm petrel;

* Early 1900s: The vegetation of the white-faced storm petrel was characterised as having a succulent herb land with bower spinach (&quot;Tetragonia implexicoma&quot;) as the dominant plant. During this time, the vegetation began to undergo significant changes.
* 1928: The first population estimate recorded around 22,000 pairs of this subspecies on Mud Islands. 
* 1940s: By this period, bower spinach was no longer recorded on the islands, likely due to intense grazing pressure from European rabbits (&quot;Oryctolagus cunciculus&quot;) which eliminated the species and resulted in low-lying vegetation and increased erosion.
* 1958: The population dropped significantly to 10,000 pairs.
* 1978: The estimates of white-face storm petrel recorded was only 5,600 pairs indicating a continued decline.
* Mid-1980s: European rabbits were removed from the islands but significant habitat changes had already occurred.
* 1990s: An increase in the number of other breeding bird species especially silver gulls (&quot;Larus novaehollandiae&quot;) and both Australian white ibis (&quot;Threskiornis molucca&quot;) and straw-necked ibis (&quot;T. spinicollis&quot;) resulted in further changes to the vegetation composition of Mud Islands. This also led to increased phosphorus and nitrogen levels in the soil. Moreover, there were other two species, coast salt bush (&quot;Atriplex cinerea&quot;) and Australian hollyhock (&quot;Lavetera arborea&quot;) showed very high in distribution and became dominant within the colony of white-faced storm petrel.
* 2007: There were less than 2,500 pairs of this subspecies in the Islands.
* Recent observations: Given Mud Islands&#x27; proximity to Melbourne city in Australia, white-faced storm petrel from this colony may be exposed to higher levels of plastic pollution compared to colonies in more remote locations such as Chalky Island with lower number of human population in Bass Strait. The increased human activity in the nearby city likely contributes to the elevated plastic contamination observed in these birds which could further impact their health and population numbers.

===== South Channel Fort (&quot;P. m. dulciae)&quot; =====
* 1920s: White-faced storm petrels first recorded breeding in this artificial island.
* 1978: The estimated population was more than 6000 pairs.
* Present: Population significantly smaller.

Potential Threats

* The invasive African boxthorn (&quot;Lycium ferocissimum&quot;) spread across the island, resulting in some petrels and silver gulls getting stuck on the thorns.
* Few of this subspecies have been discovered drowning in gun emplacements or stuck in the tunnel system
* Human visitors trampling burrows, causing disturbance.

==== Tullaberga Island (&quot;P. m. dulciae)&quot; ====

* 1978: Estimated population was over 21,000 pairs, being the biggest colony of this species in Victoria
* Present: The population has probably decreased, and the status was unclear.

Potential Threats

* Increased population of short-tailed shearwaters (&quot;Puffinus tenuirostris&quot;) potentially competing with white-faced storm petrels for nesting areas.

Conservations

* No visitor could access to the island to protect the seabird populations there.

==== Savage Islands &quot;(P. m. hypoleuca)&quot; ====
For this subspecies, due to its restricted breeding range which primarily nests in the Salvages Archipelago in the north-east Atlantic, they are considered vulnerable and has been designated as &quot;Species of European Conservation Concern&quot;.

Potential Threats and Population Estimates
* Late 15th century: Same potential threats as previous subspecies, rabbits (&quot;Oryctolagus cunciculus&quot;) were introduced intentionally to the Salvages Archipelago when the islands were first discovered.
* Unknown date: House mice (Mus musculus) have been presented on the islands for centuries was likely brought over unintentionally, posed a significant threat to the breeding colonies. Another concerning potential threats were the petrel predators that can prey on the storm petrel called yellow-legged gulls, expanding in the population few years ago.
* 2010s: Yellow-legged gulls consumed thousands of this petrel species almost every year. At the same time, these gulls have become a major factor in the decline of the petrel population.
Furthermore, the white-faced storm petrels that live in the pelagic ecosystems of the subtropical northeast Atlantic like this subspecies are increasingly affected by plastic contamination. These birds had plastic particles in their stomachs in at least 79% of them. Research conducted through analyzing the regurgitated pellets of yellow legged gulls showed the growing impact of pollution in their environment.

<doc id="392912" wikidata="Q1050018" url="?curid=392912" title="Adam Clayton Powell Jr.">
<text>Adam Clayton Powell Jr. (November 29, 1908 – April 4, 1972) was an American Baptist pastor and politician who represented the Harlem neighborhood of New York City in the United States House of Representatives from 1945 until 1971. He was the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York, as well as the first from any state in the Northeast. Re-elected for nearly three decades, Powell became a powerful national politician of the Democratic Party, and served as a national spokesman on civil rights and social issues. He also urged United States presidents to support emerging nations in Africa and Asia as they gained independence after colonialism.

In 1961, after 16 years in the House, Powell became chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, the most powerful position held by an African American in Congress to that date. As chairman, he supported the passage of important social and civil rights legislation under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Following allegations of corruption, in 1967 Powell was excluded from his seat by Democratic Representatives-elect of the 90th United States Congress, but he was re-elected and regained the seat in the 1969 ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Powell v. McCormack&quot;. He lost his seat in 1970 to Charles Rangel and retired from electoral politics.

==Early life and education==
Powell was born in 1908 in New Haven, Connecticut, the second child and only son of Adam Clayton Powell Sr. and Mattie Buster Shaffer, born poor in Virginia and West Virginia, respectively. His sister, Blanche, was 10 years older. His parents were of mixed race with African and European ancestry (and, according to his father, American Indian on his mother&#x27;s side). (In his autobiography &quot;Adam by Adam&quot;, Powell says that his mother had partial German ancestry.) They and their ancestors were classified as mulatto in 19th-century censuses. Powell&#x27;s paternal grandmother&#x27;s ancestors had been free persons of color for generations before the Civil War. By 1908, Powell Sr. had become a prominent Baptist minister, serving as a pastor in Philadelphia, and as lead pastor at a Baptist church in New Haven.

Powell Sr. had worked his way out of poverty and through Wayland Seminary, a historically black college, and postgraduate study at Yale University and Virginia Theological Seminary. In the year of his son&#x27;s birth in New Haven, Powell Sr. was called as the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City. He led the church for decades through major expansion, including fundraising for and the construction of an addition to accommodate the increased membership of the congregation during the years of the Great Migration, as many African Americans moved north from the South. That congregation grew to a community of 10,000 people.

Due to his father&#x27;s achievements, Powell grew up in a wealthy household in New York City. Because of some of his European ancestry, Adam was born with hazel eyes, light skin and blond hair, such that he could pass for white. However, he did not play with that racial ambiguity until college. He attended Townsend Harris High School, then studied at City College of New York before starting at Colgate University as a freshman. The four other African American students at Colgate at the time were all athletes. For a time, Powell briefly passed as white, using his appearance to escape racial strictures at college. The other black students were dismayed to discover what he had done.
Encouraged by his father to become a minister, Powell became more serious about his studies at Colgate, where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1930. After returning to New York, Powell began his graduate work and in 1931 earned an M.A. in religious education from Columbia University. He became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first African-American, intercollegiate Greek-lettered fraternity.

Later, apparently trying to bolster his black identity, Powell would say that his paternal grandparents were born into slavery. However, his paternal grandmother, Sally Dunning, was at least the third generation of free people of color in her family. In the 1860 census, she is listed as a free mulatto, as were her mother, grandmother, and siblings. Sally never identified the father of Adam Clayton Powell Sr., born in 1865. She appeared to have named her son after her older brother Adam Dunning, listed on the 1860 census as a farmer and the head of their household. In 1867, Sally Dunning married Anthony Bush, a mulatto freedman. All the family members were listed under the surname Dunning in the 1870 census.

The family changed its surname to Powell when they moved to Kanawha County, West Virginia, as part of their new life there. According to Charles V. Hamilton, a 1991 biographer of Powell, Anthony Bush &quot;decided to take the name Powell as a new identity&quot;, and this is how they were recorded in the 1880 census.

Adam Jr.&#x27;s mother, Mattie Buster Shaffer, was African-American with possibly some German ancestry. Her parents had been slaves in Virginia and were freed after the Civil War. Powell&#x27;s parents married in West Virginia, where they met. Numerous freedmen had migrated there in the late 19th century for work.

In Harlem, Adam Clayton Powell Jr. lived on Sugar Hill at The Garrison Apartments, 435 Convent Avenue, Apartment 3, which had also been his father&#x27;s home until his death in 1953.

==Career==
After ordination, Powell began assisting his father with charitable services at the church and as a preacher. He greatly increased the volume of meals and clothing provided to the needy, and began to learn more about the lives of the working class and poor in Harlem.

During the Great Depression in the 1930s, Powell, a handsome and charismatic figure, became a civil rights leader in Harlem. He recounted these experiences in a 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book &quot;Who Speaks for the Negro?&quot; He developed a formidable public following in the community through his crusades for jobs and affordable housing. As chairman of the Coordinating Committee for Employment, Powell used numerous methods of community organizing to bring political pressure on major businesses to open their doors to black employees at professional levels. He organized mass meetings, rent strikes, and public campaigns to force companies, utilities, and Harlem Hospital, which operated in the community, to hire black workers at skill levels higher than the lowest positions, to which they had formerly been restricted by informal discrimination.

For instance, during the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, Powell organized a picket line at the Fair&#x27;s offices in the Empire State Building. As a result, the Fair hired more black employees, increasing their numbers from about 200 to 732. In 1941, Powell led a bus boycott in Harlem, where blacks constituted the majority of passengers but held few of the jobs; the New York City Transit Authority hired 200 black workers and set the precedent for more. Powell also led a fight to have drugstores operating in Harlem hire black pharmacists. He encouraged local residents to shop only where blacks were also hired to work. &quot;Mass action is the most powerful force on earth&quot;, Powell once said, adding, &quot;As long as it is within the law, it&#x27;s not wrong; if the law is wrong, change the law&quot;.

In 1937, Powell succeeded his father as pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church. Powell Jr remained pastor of the church until 1972.

In 1942 he founded &quot;People&#x27;s Voice&quot;, a newspaper designed for &quot;a progressive African American audience, and it educated and enlightened readers on everything from local gatherings and events to U.S. civil rights issues to the political and economic struggles of the peoples of Africa. Reporters and writers for the papers included influential African Americans such as Powell himself, Powell&#x27;s sister-in-law and actress Fredi Washington, and journalist Marvel Cooke.&quot; It also served as a mouthpiece for his views. After he was elected to Congress in 1944, other people led the paper, but it finally closed in 1948, after being accused of communist connections.

==Political career==

===New York City Council===
In 1941, with the aid of New York City&#x27;s use of the single transferable vote, Powell was elected to the New York City Council as the city&#x27;s first black Council member. He received 65,736 votes, the third-best total among the six successful Council candidates.

===Congress===

In 1944, Powell ran for the United States Congress on a platform of civil rights for African Americans: support for &quot;fair employment practices, and a ban on poll taxes and lynching.&quot; Requiring poll taxes for voter registration and voting was a device used by southern states in new constitutions adopted from 1890 to 1908 to disenfranchise most blacks and many poor whites, to exclude them from politics. Poll taxes in the United States, together with the social and economic intimidation of Jim Crow laws, were maintained in the South into the 1960s to keep blacks excluded from politics and politically powerless. Although often associated with states of the former Confederate States of America, poll taxes were also in place in some northern and western states, including California, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin.

Powell was elected as a Democrat and defeated Republican candidate Sara Pelham Speaks to represent the Congressional District that included Harlem. He was the first black Congressman elected from New York State.

As the historian Charles V. Hamilton wrote in his 1992 political biography of Powell,
Here was a person who [in the 1940s] would at least &#x27;speak out.&#x27; ... That would be different ... Many Negroes were angry that no Northern liberals would get up on the floor of Congress and challenge the segregationists. ... Powell certainly promised to do that ...

[In] the 1940s and 1950s, he was, indeed, virtually alone ... And precisely because of that, he was exceptionally crucial. In many instances during those earlier times, if &quot;he&quot; did not speak out, the issue would not have been raised. ... For example, only &quot;he&quot; could (or would dare to) challenge Congressman Rankin of Mississippi on the House floor in the 1940s for using the word &quot;nigger&quot;. He certainly did not change Rankin&#x27;s mind or behavior, but he gave solace to millions who longed for a little retaliatory defiance.

Powell was banned from the White House after calling President Truman&#x27;s wife Bess Truman the &quot;Last Lady of the Land&quot; because she attended a reception for the Daughters of the American Revolution after the organization had refused to allow the black pianist Hazel Scott, Powell&#x27;s wife, to perform at the DAR Constitution Hall and Truman&#x27;s attendance was seen as an endorsement of this racism.

As one of only two black Congressmen (the other being William Levi Dawson) until 1955, Powell challenged the informal ban on black representatives using Capitol facilities previously reserved for white members. He took black constituents to dine with him in the &quot;Whites Only&quot; House restaurant. He clashed with the many segregationists from the South in his party.

Powell worked closely with Clarence Mitchell Jr., the representative of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Washington, D.C., to try to gain justice in federal programs. Biographer Hamilton described the NAACP as &quot;the quarterback that threw the ball to Powell, who, to his credit, was more than happy to catch and run with it.&quot; He developed a strategy known as the &quot;Powell Amendments&quot;. &quot;On bill after bill that proposed federal expenditures, Powell would offer &#x27;our customary amendment&#x27;, requiring that federal funds be denied to any jurisdiction that maintained segregation; Liberals would be embarrassed, Southern politicians angered.&quot; This principle would later become integrated into Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Powell was also willing to act independently; in 1956, he broke party ranks and supported President Dwight D. Eisenhower for re-election, saying the civil rights plank in the Democratic Party platform was too weak. In 1958, he survived a determined effort by the Tammany Hall Democratic Party machine in New York to oust him in the primary election. In 1960, Powell, hearing of planned civil rights marches at the Democratic Convention, which could embarrass the party or candidate, threatened to accuse Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. of having a homosexual relationship with Bayard Rustin unless the marches were canceled. Rustin, one of King&#x27;s political advisers, was an openly gay man. King agreed to cancel the planned events and Rustin resigned from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

===Global work===
Powell also paid attention to the issues of developing nations in Africa and Asia, making trips overseas. He urged presidential policymakers to pay attention to nations seeking independence from colonial powers and support aid to them. During the Cold War, many of them sought neutrality between the United States and the Soviet Union. He made speeches on the House Floor to celebrate the anniversaries of the independence of nations such as Ghana, Indonesia, and Sierra Leone.

In 1955, against the State Department&#x27;s advice, Powell attended the Asian–African Conference in Bandung, Indonesia, as an observer. He made a positive international impression in public addresses that balanced his concerns of his nation&#x27;s race relations problems with a spirited defense of the United States as a whole against Communist criticisms. Powell returned to the United States to a warm bipartisan reception for his performance, and he was invited to meet with President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

With this influence, Powell suggested to the State Department that the current manner of competing with the Soviet Union in the realm of fine arts such as international symphony orchestra and ballet company tours was ineffective. Instead, he advised that the United States should focus on the popular arts, such as sponsoring international tours of leading jazz musicians, which could draw attention to an indigenous American art form and featured musicians who often performed in mixed race bands. The State Department approved the idea. The first such tour with Dizzy Gillespie proved to be an outstanding success abroad and prompted similarly popular tours featuring other musicians for many years.

===Committee chairmanship and legislation===
In 1961, after 15 years in Congress, Powell advanced to chairman of the powerful United States House Committee on Education and Labor. In this position, he presided over federal social programs for minimum wage and Medicaid (established later under Johnson); he expanded the minimum wage to include retail workers; and worked for equal pay for women; he supported education and training for the deaf, nursing education, and vocational training; he led legislation for standards for wages and work hours; as well as for aid for elementary and secondary education, and school libraries. Powell&#x27;s committee proved extremely effective in enacting major parts of President Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;New Frontier&quot; and President Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Great Society&quot; social programs and the War on Poverty. It successfully reported to Congress &quot;49 pieces of bedrock legislation&quot;, as President Johnson put it in a May 18, 1966, letter congratulating Powell on the fifth anniversary of his chairmanship.

Powell was instrumental in passing legislation that made lynching a federal crime, as well as bills that desegregated public schools. He challenged the Southern practice of charging Blacks a poll tax to vote. Poll taxes for federal elections were prohibited by the 24th Amendment, passed in 1964. Voter registration and electoral practices were not changed substantially in most of the South until after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided federal oversight of voter registration and elections, and enforcement of the constitutional right to vote. In some areas where discrimination was severe, such as Mississippi, it took years for African Americans to register and vote in numbers related to their proportion in the population, but they have since maintained a high rate of registration and voting.

===Political controversy===
By the mid-1960s, Powell was increasingly being criticized for mismanaging his committee&#x27;s budget, taking trips abroad at public expense, and missing meetings of his committee. When under scrutiny by the press and other members of Congress for personal conduct—he had taken two young women at government expense with him on overseas travel—he responded:I wish to state very emphatically... that I will always do just what every other Congressman and committee chairman has done and is doing and will do.&quot; Opponents led criticism in his District, where his refusal to pay a 1963 slander judgment in the amount of $150,000, made him subject to arrest; he also spent increasing amounts of time in Florida.

==== Select House Committee to investigate Representative Adam Clayton Powell ====
In January 1967, the House Democratic Caucus stripped Powell of his committee chairmanship. A series of hearings on Powell&#x27;s misconduct had been held by the 89th Congress in December 1966 that produced the evidence that the House Democratic Caucus cited in taking this action. A Select House Committee was established upon the House&#x27;s reconvening for the 90th Congress to further investigate Powell&#x27;s misconduct to determine if he should be allowed to take his seat. This committee was appointed by the Speaker of the House. Its chairman was Emanuel Celler of New York and its members were James C. Corman, Claude Pepper, John Conyers, Andrew Jacobs Jr., Arch A. Moore Jr., Charles M. Teague, Clark MacGregor, and Vernon W. Thomson. This committee&#x27;s inquiry centered on the following issues: &quot;1. Mr. Powell&#x27;s age, citizenship, and inhabitancy [sic]; 2. The status of legal proceedings to which Mr. Powell was a party in the State of New York and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico with particular reference to the instances in which he has been held in contempt of court; and 3. Matters of Mr. Powell&#x27;s alleged official misconduct since January 3, 1961.&quot;

Hearings of the Select House Committee to investigate Rep. Adam Clayton Powell were held over three days in February 1967. Powell was in attendance only on the first day of these hearings, February 8. Neither he nor his legal counsel requested that the select committee summon any witnesses. According to the official Congressional report on these committee hearings, Powell and his counsel&#x27;s official position was that &quot;the Committee had no authority to consider the misconduct charges.&quot;

The select committee found that Powell met residency requirements for Congressional representatives under the Constitution, but that Powell had asserted an unconstitutional immunity from earlier rulings against him in criminal cases tried in the New York State Supreme Court. The committee also found that Powell had committed numerous acts of financial misconduct. These included the appropriation of Congressional funds for his personal use, the use of funds meant for the House Education and Labor Committee to pay the salary of a housekeeper at his property on Bimini in The Bahamas, purchasing airline tickets for himself, family, and friends from the funds of the House Education and Labor Committee, as well as making false reports on expenditures of foreign currency while heading of the House Education and Labor Committee.

The members of the Select Committee had different opinions on the fate of Powell&#x27;s seat. Pepper was strongly in favor of recommending that Powell not be seated at all, while Conyers, the only African American Representative on the Select Committee, felt that any punishment beyond severe censure was inappropriate. In fact, in the committee&#x27;s official report, Conyers asserted that Powell&#x27;s conduct during the two investigations of his conduct was not contrary to the dignity of the House of Representatives, as had been suggested by the investigation. Conyers also suggested that cases of misconduct brought before the House of Representatives never exceed censure. In the end, the Select House Committee to investigate Rep. Adam Clayton Powell recommended that Powell be seated but stripped of his seniority and forced to pay a fine of $40,000, citing article I, section 5, clause 2 of the Constitution, which gives each house of Congress the ability to punish members for improper conduct.

The full House refused to seat him until the completion of the investigation. Powell urged his supporters to &quot;keep the faith, baby,&quot; while the investigation was underway. On March 1, the House voted 307 to 116 to exclude him, despite the recommendation of the Select Committee. Powell said, &quot;On this day, the day of March, in my opinion, is the end of the United States of America as the land of the free and the home of the brave.&quot;

Powell won the Special Election to fill the vacancy caused by his exclusion, receiving 86% of the vote. But he did not take his seat, as he was filing a separate suit. He sued in &quot;Powell v. McCormack&quot; to retain his seat. In November 1968, Powell was re-elected. On January 3, 1969, he was seated as a member of the 91st Congress, but he was fined $25,000 and denied seniority. In June 1969, in &quot;Powell v. McCormack&quot;, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the House had acted unconstitutionally when it excluded Powell, as he had been duly elected by his constituents.

Powell&#x27;s increasing absenteeism was observed by constituents, which contributed, in June 1970, to his defeat in the Democratic primary for reelection to his seat by Charles B. Rangel. Powell failed to garner enough signatures for inclusion on the November ballot as an Independent, and Rangel won that (and following) general elections. In the fall of 1970, Powell moved to his retreat on Bimini in The Bahamas, also resigning as minister at the Abyssinian Baptist Church.

==Marriage and family==

In 1933, Powell married Isabel Washington (1908–2007), an African American singer and nightclub entertainer. She was the sister of actress Fredi Washington. Powell adopted Washington&#x27;s son, Preston, from her first marriage.

After their divorce, in 1945, Powell married the jazz pianist and singer Hazel Scott. They had a son named Adam Clayton Powell III. In the early 21st century, Adam Clayton Powell III became Vice Provost for Globalization at the University of Southern California.

Powell divorced again, and in 1960 married Yvette Flores Diago from Puerto Rico. They had a son, whom they named Adam Clayton Powell Diago, using the mother&#x27;s surname as a second surname, according to Hispanic tradition. In 1980, this son changed his name to Adam Clayton Powell IV, dropping &quot;Diago&quot; from his name when he moved to the mainland United States from Puerto Rico to attend Howard University. Adam Clayton Powell IV, also known as A. C. Powell IV, was elected to the New York City Council in 1991 in a special election; he served for two terms. He also was elected as a New York state Assemblyman (D-East Harlem) for three terms and had a son named Adam Clayton Powell V. In 1994, and again in 2010, Adam Clayton Powell IV unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Rep. Charles B. Rangel for the Democratic nomination in his father&#x27;s former congressional district.

==Family scandal==
In 1967, a U.S. Congressional committee subpoenaed Yvette Diago, the former third wife of Powell Jr. and the mother of Adam Clayton Powell IV. They were investigating potential &quot;theft of state funds&quot; related to her having been on Powell Jr.&#x27;s payroll but not doing any work. Yvette Diago admitted to the committee that she had been on the Congressional payroll of her former husband, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., from 1961 until 1967, although she had moved back to Puerto Rico in 1961. As reported by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Yvette Diago had continued living in Puerto Rico and &quot;performed no work at all,&quot; yet was kept on the payroll. Her salary was increased to $20,578 and she was paid until January 1967, when she was exposed and fired.

==Death==
In April 1972, Powell became gravely ill and was flown to a Miami hospital from his home in Bimini. He died there on April 4, 1972, at the age of 63, from acute prostatitis, according to contemporary newspaper accounts. After his funeral at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, his son, Adam III, poured his ashes from a plane over the waters of Bimini.

==Legacy==

Seventh Avenue north of Central Park through Harlem has been renamed as Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. One of the landmarks along this street is the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building, named for Powell in 1983.

In addition, two New York City schools were named after him, PS 153, at 1750 Amsterdam Ave., and a middle school, IS 172 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. School of Social Justice, at 509 W. 129th St. It closed in 2009. In 2011, the new Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Paideia Academy opened in Chicago&#x27;s South Shore neighborhood.

Investigations into Powell&#x27;s misconduct have been cited as an impetus for a permanent ethics committee in the House of Representatives as well as a permanent code of conduct for House Members and their staff.

==Representation in other media==
Powell was the subject of the 2002 cable television film &quot;Keep the Faith, Baby&quot;, starring Harry Lennix as Powell and Vanessa Williams as his second wife, jazz pianist Hazel Scott. The film debuted on February 17, 2002, on premium cable network Showtime. It garnered three NAACP Image Award nominations for Outstanding Television Movie, Outstanding Actor in a Television Movie (Lennix), and Outstanding Actress in a TV Movie (Williams). It won two National Association of Minorities in Cable (NAMIC) Vision Awards for Best Drama and Best Actor in a Television Film (Lennix), the International Press Association&#x27;s Best Actress in a Television Film Award (Williams), and Reel.com&#x27;s Best Actor in a Television Film (Lennix). The film&#x27;s producers were Geoffrey L. Garfield, Powell IV&#x27;s long-time campaign manager; Monty Ross, a confidant of Spike Lee; son Adam Clayton Powell III; and Hollywood veteran Harry J. Ufland. The film was written by Art Washington and directed by Doug McHenry.

Powell is portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito in the 2019 Epix cable series &quot;Godfather of Harlem&quot;.

Powell is featured by Paul Deo in his 2017 Harlem mural &quot;Planet Harlem&quot;.

Jeffrey Wright portrayed Powell in the 2023 Netflix film &quot;Rustin&quot;. As the story unfolds, the Powell character slowly comes around to a more positive view of the controversial Bayard Rustin character, who is portrayed as a Powell foe as the March on Washington is created.

Powell is referenced in the Vic Chesnutt song &quot; Woodrow Wilson &quot;

<text>USS &quot;Wasp&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-18) was one of 24 s built during World War II for the United States Navy. The ship, the ninth US Navy ship to bear the name, was originally named &quot;Oriskany&quot;, but was renamed while under construction in honor of the previous , which was sunk 15 September 1942. &quot;Wasp&quot; was commissioned in November 1943, and served in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning eight battle stars. Like many of her sister ships, she was decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, but was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). In her second career, she operated mainly in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Caribbean. She played a prominent role in the manned space program, serving as the recovery ship for five Project Gemini missions: Gemini IV, Gemini VI, Gemini VII, Gemini IX, and Gemini XII. She was retired in 1972, and sold for scrap in 1973.

==Construction and commissioning==
The ship was laid down as Oriskany on 18 March 1942 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem Steel Company, and renamed &quot;Wasp&quot; on 13 November 1942, shortly after the sinking of the previous &quot;Wasp&quot;. She was launched on 17 August 1943, sponsored by Miss Julia M. Walsh, the sister of Senator David I. Walsh of Massachusetts, and commissioned on 24 November 1943, with Captain Clifton A. F. Sprague in command.

==Service history==

===World War II===
Following a shakedown cruise which lasted through the end of 1943, &quot;Wasp&quot; returned to Boston for a brief yard period to correct minor flaws which had been discovered during her time at sea. On 10 January 1944, the new aircraft carrier departed Boston, steamed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, and remained there until the last day of the month, when she sailed for Trinidad, her base of operations through 22 February. She returned to Boston five days later and prepared for service in the Pacific. Early in March, the ship sailed south, transited the Panama Canal, arrived at San Diego on 21 March, and reached Pearl Harbor on 4 April.

Following training exercises in Hawaiian waters, &quot;Wasp&quot; steamed to the Marshall Islands and at Majuro, Rear Admiral Alfred E. Montgomery&#x27;s newly formed Task Group 58.6 (TG 58.6) of Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher&#x27;s Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 58). On 14 May, she and her sister carriers of TG 58.6, and the light aircraft carrier , sortied for raids on Marcus and Wake Islands to give the new task group combat experience, to test a recently devised system of assigning—before takeoff—each pilot a specific target, and to neutralize those islands for the forthcoming Marianas Campaign. As the force neared Marcus, it split, sending &quot;San Jacinto&quot; north to search for Japanese picket boats while &quot;Wasp&quot; and &quot;Essex&quot; launched strikes on 19 and 20 May, aimed at installations on the island. American planes encountered heavy antiaircraft fire but still managed to do enough damage to prevent Japanese forces on the island from interfering with the impending assault on Saipan.

When weather cancelled launches planned for 21 May, the two carriers rejoined &quot;San Jacinto&quot; and steamed to Wake. Planes from all three carriers pounded that island on 24 May and were sufficiently effective to neutralize that base. However, the system of selecting targets for each plane fell short of the Navy&#x27;s expectations, and thereafter, tactical air commanders resumed responsibility for directing the attacks of their planes.

==== The Mariana and Palau Islands ====
After the strike on Wake, TG 58.6 returned to Majuro to prepare for the Marianas campaign. On 6 June, &quot;Wasp&quot;—reassigned to TG 58.2 which was also commanded by Rear Admiral Montgomery—sortied for the invasion of Saipan. During the afternoon of 11 June, she and her sister carriers launched fighters for strikes against Japanese air bases on Saipan and Tinian. They were challenged by some 30 land-based fighters, which they promptly shot down. Antiaircraft fire was heavy, but the American planes braved it as they went on to destroy many of the Japanese aircraft still on the ground. During the next three days, the American fighters—now joined by bombers—pounded installations on Saipan to soften up Japanese defenses for American assault troops who would go ashore on 15 June. That day and thereafter until the morning of June, planes from TGs 58.2 and TG 58.3 provided close air support for Marines fighting on the Saipan beachhead. The fast carriers of those task groups then turned over to escort carriers responsibility for providing air support for the American ground forces, refueled, and steamed to meet with TGs 58.1 and 58.4, which were returning from strikes against Chichi and Iwo Jima to prevent Japanese air bases on those islands from being used to launch attacks against American forces on or near Saipan.

=====Battle of the Philippine Sea=====
Meanwhile, Japan—determined to defend Saipan, no matter how high the cost—was sending Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa&#x27;s powerful First Mobile Fleet from the Sulu Islands to the Marianas to sink the warships of Admiral Raymond A. Spruance&#x27;s 5th Fleet and to annihilate the American troops who had fought their way ashore on Saipan. Soon after the Japanese task force sortied from Tawi Tawi on the morning of 13 June, American submarine spotted and reported it. Other submarines—which from time to time made contact with Ozawa&#x27;s warships—kept Spruance posted on their progress as they wended their way through the islands of the Philippines, transited San Bernardino Strait, and took part in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. All day on 18 June 1944, each force sent out scout planes in an effort to locate its adversary. Because of their greater range, the Japanese aircraft managed to obtain some knowledge of Spruance&#x27;s ships, but American scout planes were unable to find Ozawa&#x27;s force. Early the following morning, 19 June, aircraft from Mitscher&#x27;s carriers headed for Guam to neutralize that island for the coming battle and in a series of dogfights, destroyed many Japanese land-based planes.

During the morning, carriers from Ozawa&#x27;s fleet launched four massive raids against their American counterparts, but all were thwarted almost completely. Nearly all of the Japanese warplanes were shot down while failing to sink a single American ship. They did manage to score a single bomb hit on , but that solitary success did not put the battleship out of action. That day, Mitscher&#x27;s planes did not find the Japanese ships, but American submarines succeeded in sending two enemy carriers ( and ) to the bottom. In the evening, three of Mitscher&#x27;s four carrier task groups headed west in search of Ozawa&#x27;s retiring fleet, leaving only TG 58.4 and a gun line of old battleships in the immediate vicinity of the Marianas to cover ground forces on Saipan. Planes from the American carriers failed to find the Japanese force until mid-afternoon on the 20th when an Avenger pilot reported spotting Ozawa almost 300 mi ( km) from the American carriers. Mitscher daringly ordered an all-out strike even though he knew that night would descend before his planes could return.

Over two hours later, the American aviators caught up with their quarry. They damaged two oilers so severely that they had to be scuttled; sank carrier , and scored damaging but non-lethal hits on carriers , , , and several other Japanese ships. However, during the sunset attack, the fuel gauges in many of the American planes registered half empty or more, presaging an anxious flight back to their now distant carriers. When the carriers spotted the first returning plane at 2030 that night, Rear Admiral J. J. Clark defied the menace of Japanese submarines by ordering all lights to be turned on to guide the weary fliers home. After a plane from &quot;Hornet&quot; landed on &quot;Lexington&quot;, Mitscher gave pilots permission to land on any available deck. Despite these unusual efforts to help the Navy&#x27;s airmen, a good many planes ran out of fuel before they reached the carriers and dropped into the water.

When fuel calculations indicated that no aircraft which had not returned could still be aloft, Mitscher ordered the carriers to reverse course and resume the stern chase of Ozawa&#x27;s surviving ships—more in the hope of finding any downed fliers who might still be alive and pulling them from the sea than in the expectation of overtaking Japan&#x27;s First Mobile Fleet before it reached the protection of the Emperor&#x27;s land-based planes. During the chase, Mitscher&#x27;s ships picked up 36 pilots and 26 crewmen. At midmorning of 21 June, Admiral Spruance detached &quot;Wasp&quot; and from their task group and sent them with Admiral Lee&#x27;s battleships in Ozawa&#x27;s wake to locate and destroy any crippled enemy ships. The ensuing two-day hunt failed to flush out any game, so this &quot;ad hoc&quot; force headed toward Eniwetok for replenishment and well-earned rest.

=====Subsequent operations=====
The respite was brief, for on 30 June, &quot;Wasp&quot; sortied in TG 58.2—with TG 58.1—for strikes at Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima. Planes from the carriers pounded those islands on 3–4 July and, during the raids, destroyed 75 enemy aircraft, for the most part in the air. Then, as a grand finale, cruisers from the force&#x27;s screen shelled Iwo Jima for two and one-half hours. The next day, 5 July, the two task groups returned to the Marianas and attacked Guam and Rota to begin more than a fortnight&#x27;s effort to soften the Japanese defenses there in preparation for landings on Guam. Planes from &quot;Wasp&quot; and her sister carriers provided close air support for the marines and soldiers who stormed ashore on 21 July. The next day, TG 58.2 sortied with two other groups of Mitscher&#x27;s carriers headed southwest toward the Western Carolines, and launched raids against the Palaus on the 25th. The force then parted, with TGs 58.1 and 58.3 steaming back north for further raids to keep the Bonin and Volcano Islands neutralized while &quot;Wasp&quot; in TG 58.2 was retiring toward the Marshalls for replenishment at Eniwetok which she reached on 2 August.

Toward the end of &quot;Wasp&quot;″s stay at that base, Admiral Halsey relieved Admiral Spruance on 26 August and the 5th Fleet became the 3rd Fleet. Two days later, the Fast Carrier Task Force—redesignated TF 38—sortied for the Palaus. On 6 September, &quot;Wasp&quot;, now assigned to Vice Admiral John S. McCain, Sr.&#x27;s TG 38.1, began three days of raids on the Palaus. On 9 September, she headed for the southern Philippines to neutralize air power there during the American conquest of Morotai, Peleliu, and Ulithi—three islands needed as advanced bases during the impending campaign to liberate the Philippines. Planes from these carriers encountered little resistance as they lashed Mindanao airfields that day and on 10 September. Raids against the Visayan Islands on 12 and 13 September were carried out with impunity and were equally successful. Learning of the lack of Japanese air defenses in the southern Philippines enabled Allied strategists to cancel an invasion of Mindanao which had been scheduled to begin on 16 November. Instead, Allied forces could go straight to Leyte and advance the recapture of Philippine soil by almost a month. D-day in the Palaus, 15 September, found &quot;Wasp&quot; and TG 38.1 some 50 mi (80 km) off Morotai, launching air strikes. It then returned to the Philippines for revisits to Mindanao and the Visayas before retiring to the Admiralties on 29 September for replenishment at Manus in preparation for the liberation of the Philippines.

====Philippines campaign====
Ready to resume battle, she got underway again on 4 October and steamed to the Philippine Sea, where TF 38 reassembled at twilight on the evening of 7 October, some 375 mi (604 km) west of the Marianas. Its mission was to neutralize airbases within operational air distance of the Philippines to keep Japanese warplanes out of the air during the American landings on Leyte scheduled to begin on 20 October. The carriers steamed north to meet with a group of nine oilers, and spent the next day, 8 October, refueling. They then followed a generally northwesterly course toward the Ryūkyūs until 10 October, when their planes raided Okinawa, Amami, and Miyaki. That day, TF 38 planes destroyed a Japanese submarine tender, 12 sampans, and over 100 planes. But for Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle&#x27;s Tokyo raid from &quot;Hornet&quot; (CV-8) on 18 April 1942 and the daring war patrols of Pacific Fleet submarines, this carrier foray was the United States Navy&#x27;s closest approach to the Japanese home islands up to that point in the war.

Beginning on 12 October, Formosa received three days of unwelcome attention from TF 38 planes. In response, the Japanese Navy made an all-out effort to protect that strategic island, though doing so meant denuding its remaining carriers of aircraft. Yet, the attempt to thwart the ever-advancing American Pacific Fleet was futile. At the end of a three-day air battle, Japan had lost more than 500 planes and 20-odd freighters. Many other merchant ships were damaged as were hangars, barracks, warehouses, industrial plants, and ammunition dumps. However, the victory was costly to the United States Navy, for TF 38 lost 79 planes and 64 pilots and air crewmen, while cruisers &quot;Canberra&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot; and carrier &quot;Franklin&quot; received damaging, but nonlethal, torpedo and bomb hits.

From Formosa, TF 38 shifted its attention to the Philippines. After steaming to waters east of Luzon, TG 58.1 began to launch strikes against that island on the 18th and continued the attack the following day, hitting Manila for the first time since it was occupied by the Japanese early in the war. On 20 October, the day the first American troops waded ashore on Leyte, &quot;Wasp&quot; had moved south to the station off that island whence she and her sister carriers launched some planes for close air support missions to assist MacArthur&#x27;s soldiers, while sending other aircraft to destroy airfields on Mindanao, Cebu, Negros, Panay, and Leyte. TG 38.1 refueled the following day and, on 22 October, set a course for Ulithi to rearm and provision.

=====Battle of Leyte Gulf=====
While McCain&#x27;s carriers were steaming away from the Philippines, great events were taking place in the waters of that archipelago. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the commander in chief of Japan&#x27;s Combined Fleet, activated plan Sho-Go-1, a scheme for bringing about a decisive naval action off Leyte, the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The Japanese strategy called for Ozawa&#x27;s carriers to act as a decoy to lure TF 38 north of Luzon and away from the Leyte beachhead. Then—with the American fast carriers out of the way—heavy Japanese surface ships were to debouch into Leyte Gulf from two directions: from the south through Surigao Strait and from the north through San Bernardino Strait. During much of 24 October, planes from Halsey&#x27;s carrier task groups still in Philippine waters pounded Admiral Kurita&#x27;s powerful Force &quot;A&quot;, or Center Force, as it steamed across the Sibuyan Sea toward San Bernardino Strait. When darkness stopped their attack, the American aircraft had sunk superbattleship &quot;Musashi&quot; and had damaged several other Japanese warships. Moreover, Halsey&#x27;s pilots reported that Kurita&#x27;s force had reversed course and was moving away from San Bernardino Strait.

That night, Admiral Nishimura&#x27;s Force &quot;C&quot;, or Southern Force, attempted to transit Surigao Strait, but met a line of old battleships commanded by Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf. The venerable American men-of-war crossed Nishimura&#x27;s &quot;T&quot; and all but annihilated his force. Admiral Shima—who was following in Nishimura&#x27;s wake to lend support—realized that disaster had struck and wisely withdrew. Meanwhile, late in the afternoon of 24 October—after Kurita&#x27;s Center Force had turned away from San Bernardino Strait in apparent retreat—Halsey&#x27;s scout planes finally located Ozawa&#x27;s carriers less than 200 mi (320 km) north of TF 38. This intelligence prompted Halsey to head north toward Ozawa with his Fast Carrier Task Force. However, at this point, he did not recall McCain&#x27;s TG 58.1, but allowed it to continue steaming toward Ulithi. After dark, Kurita&#x27;s Center Force again reversed course and once more headed for San Bernardino Strait. About 30 minutes past midnight, it transited that narrow passage; turned to starboard; and steamed south, down the east coast of Samar. Since Halsey had dashed north in pursuit of Ozawa&#x27;s carriers, only three 7th Fleet escort carrier groups and their destroyer and destroyer escort screens were available to challenge Kurita&#x27;s mighty battleships and heavy cruisers and to protect the American amphibious ships which were supporting the troops fighting on Leyte.

Remembered by their call names, &quot;Taffy 1&quot;, &quot;Taffy 2&quot;, and &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, these three American escort-carrier groups were deployed along Samar&#x27;s east coast with Taffy 3 in the northernmost position, about 40 mi ( km) off Paninihian Point. Taffy 2 was covering Leyte Gulf, and &quot;Taffy 1&quot; was still farther south watching Surigao Strait. At 0645, lookouts on Taffy 3 ships spotted bursts of antiaircraft fire blossoming in the northern sky, as Center Force gunners opened fire on an American antisubmarine patrol plane. Moments later, Taffy 3 made both radar and visual contact with the approaching Japanese warships. Shortly before 0700, Kurita&#x27;s guns opened fire on the hapless &quot;baby flattops&quot; and their comparatively tiny but incredibly courageous escorts. For more than two hours, Taffy 3&#x27;s ships and planes—aided by aircraft from sister escort-carrier groups to the south—fought back with torpedoes, guns, bombs, and consummate seamanship. Then, at 0311, Kurita—shaken by the loss of three heavy cruisers and thinking that he had been fighting TF 38—ordered his remaining warships to break off the action.

Meanwhile, at 0848, Admiral Halsey had radioed McCain&#x27;s TG 58.1—then refueling en route to Ulithi—calling that carrier group back to Philippine waters to help Taffy 3 in its fight for survival. &quot;Wasp&quot; and her consorts raced toward Samar at flank speed until 1030 when they began launching planes for strikes at Kurita&#x27;s ships which were still some 330 miles away. While these raids did little damage to the Japanese Center Force, they did strengthen Kurita&#x27;s decision to retire from Leyte. While his planes were in the air, McCain&#x27;s carriers continued to speed westward to lessen the distance of his pilots&#x27; return flight and to be in optimum position at dawn to launch more warplanes at the fleeing enemy force. With the first light of 26 October, TG 38.1 and Rear Admiral Bogan&#x27;s TG 38.2—which finally had been sent south by Halsey—launched the first of their strikes that day against Kurita. The second left the carriers a little over two hours later. These fliers sank light cruiser &quot;Noshiro&quot; and damaged, but did not sink, heavy cruiser &quot;Kumano&quot;. The two task groups launched a third strike in the early afternoon, but it did not add to their score.

=====Later operations=====
Following the Battle of Leyte Gulf, TG 38.1 operated in the Philippines for two more days, providing close air support before again heading for Ulithi on 28 October. However, the respite—during which Rear Admiral Montgomery took command of TG 38.1 when McCain fleeted up to relieve Mitscher as TF 38—was brief; Japanese land-based planes attacked troops on the Leyte beachhead on 1 November. &quot;Wasp&quot; participated in raids against Luzon air bases on 5 and 6 November, destroying over 400 Japanese aircraft, for the most part on the ground. A &quot;kamikaze&quot; hit &quot;Lexington&quot; during the operation. Afterwards, &quot;Wasp&quot; returned to Guam to exchange air groups.

&quot;Wasp&quot; returned to the Philippines a little before midmonth and continued to send strikes against targets in the Philippines until 26 November when the Army Air Forces assumed responsibility for providing air support for troops on Leyte. TF 38 then retired to Ulithi. There, the carriers received greater complements of fighter planes, and in late November and early December, conducted training exercises to prepare them better to deal with the new kamikaze threat.

TF 38 sortied from Ulithi on 10 and 11 December and proceeded to a position east of Luzon for round-the-clock strikes against air bases on that island from 14 through 16 December to prevent Japanese fighter planes from endangering landings on the southwest coast of Mindoro scheduled for 15 December. Then, while withdrawing to a fueling rendezvous point east of the Philippines, TF 38 was caught in a terribly destructive typhoon which battered its ships and sank three American destroyers. The carriers spent most of the ensuing week repairing storm damage and returned to Ulithi on Christmas Eve.

The accelerating tempo of the war, though, ruled out long repose in the shelter of the lagoon. Before the year ended, the carriers were back in action against airfields in the Philippines on Sakishima Gunto, and on Okinawa. These raids were intended to smooth the way for General MacArthur&#x27;s invasion of Luzon through Lingayen Gulf. While the carrier planes were unable to knock out all Japanese air resistance to the Luzon landings, they did succeed in destroying many enemy planes, and thus reduced the air threat to manageable proportions.

On the night after the initial landings on Luzon, 9 January 1945, Halsey took TF 38 into the South China Sea for a week&#x27;s rampage in which his ships and planes took a heavy toll of Japanese shipping and aircraft before they retransited Luzon Strait on 16 January and returned to the Philippine Sea. Bad weather prevented Halsey&#x27;s planes from going aloft for the next few days, but on 21 January 1945, they bombed Formosa, the Pescadores, and the Sakishimas. The following day, the aircraft returned to the Sakishimas and the Ryūkyūs for more bombing and reconnaissance. The overworked Fast Carrier Task Force then headed for Ulithi and entered that lagoon on 26 January.

While the flattops were catching their breath at Ulithi, Admiral Spruance relieved Halsey in command of the fleet, which was thereby transformed from the 3rd to the 5th Fleet. The metamorphosis also entailed Mitscher&#x27;s replacing McCain and Clark&#x27;s resuming command of TG 58.1—still &quot;Wasp&quot;″s task group.

====Battle of Iwo Jima====
The next major operation dictated by Allied strategy was the capture of Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands. Iwo was needed as a base for fighter planes to escort B-29 Superfortress bombers from the Marianas attacking the Japanese home islands, and as an emergency landing point for crippled planes. TF 58 sortied on 10 February, held rehearsals at Tinian, and then headed for Japan. Fighter planes took off from the carriers before dawn on 16 February to clear the skies of Japanese aircraft. They succeeded in this mission, but &quot;Wasp&quot; lost several of her fighters during the sweep. Bombing sorties, directed primarily at aircraft factories in Tokyo, followed, but clouds hid many of these plants, forcing some planes to drop their bombs on secondary targets. Bad weather, which also hampered Mitscher&#x27;s fliers during raids the next morning, prompted him to cancel strikes scheduled for the afternoon and head the task force west. During the night, Mitscher turned the carriers toward the Volcano Islands to be on hand to provide air support for the Marines who would land on beaches of Iwo Jima on the morning of 19 February.

For the next few days, planes from the American carriers continued to assist the Marines who were engaged in a bloody struggle to wrest the island from its fanatical defenders. On 23 February, Mitscher led his carriers back to Japan for more raids on Tokyo. Planes took off on the morning of 25 February, but when they reached Tokyo, they again found their targets obscured by clouds. Moreover, visibility was so bad the next day that raids on Nagoya were called off, and the carriers steamed south toward the Ryūkyūs to bomb and reconnoiter Okinawa, the next prize to be taken from the Japanese Empire. Planes left the carriers at dawn on 1 March, and throughout the day, they hammered and photographed the islands of the Ryūkyū group. Then, after a night bombardment by surface ships, TF 58 set a course for the Carolines and anchored in Ulithi lagoon on 4 March.

Damaged as she was, &quot;Wasp&quot; recorded—from 17 to 23 March—what was often referred to as the busiest week in flattop history. In these seven days, &quot;Wasp&quot; accounted for 14 enemy planes in the air, destroyed six more on the ground, scored two 500 lb (230 kg) bomb hits on each of two Japanese carriers, dropped two 1,000 lb (450 kg) bombs on a Japanese battleship, put one 1,000 lb bomb on another battleship, hit a heavy cruiser with three 500 lb missiles, dropped another 1,000 lb bomb on a big cargo ship, and heavily strafed &quot;and probably sank&quot; a large Japanese submarine. During this week, &quot;Wasp&quot; was under almost continuous attack by shore-based aircraft, and experienced several close &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. The carrier&#x27;s gunners fired more than 10,000 rounds at the determined Japanese attackers.

In spite of valiant efforts of her gunners, on 19 March 1945, &quot;Wasp&quot; was hit with a 500-pound armor-piercing bomb. The bomb penetrated the flight deck and the armor-plated hangar deck, and exploded in the crew&#x27;s galley. Many of her shipmates were having breakfast after being at general quarters all night. The blast disabled the number-four fire room. Around 102 crewmen were lost. Despite the losses, &quot;Wasp&quot; continued operations with the Task Group and the air group was carrying out flight operations 27 minutes after the damage.

====End of the war====
On 13 April 1945, &quot;Wasp&quot; returned to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, and had the damage caused by the bomb hit repaired. Once whole again, she steamed to Hawaii, and after a brief sojourn at Pearl Harbor, headed toward the western Pacific on 12 July 1945. &quot;Wasp&quot; conducted a strike at Wake Island and paused briefly at Eniwetok before rejoining the rampaging Fast Carrier Task Force. In a series of strikes, unique in the almost complete absence of enemy airborne planes, &quot;Wasp&quot; pilots struck Yokosuka Naval Base near Tokyo, numerous airfields, and hidden manufacturing centers. On 9 August, a &quot;kamikaze&quot; plane swooped down at the carrier, but an alert gunner, who was cleaning his gun at the time, started shooting at the airplane. He shot straight through the windshield and killed the pilot, but the plane kept on coming. Next, he shot off a wing of the airplane, causing it to veer off to the side, missing the ship.

Then, on 15 August, when the fighting should have been over, two Japanese planes tried to attack &quot;Wasp&quot;″s task group. Fortunately, &quot;Wasp&quot; pilots were still flying on combat air patrol and sent both enemies smoking into the sea. This was the last time &quot;Wasp&quot; pilots and gunners were to tangle with the Japanese.

On 25 August 1945, a severe typhoon, with winds reaching 78 kn (140 km/h), engulfed &quot;Wasp&quot; and stove in about 30 ft (9 m) of her bow. The carrier, despite the hazardous job of flying from such a shortened deck, continued to launch her planes on missions of mercy or patrol as they carried food, medicine, and long-deserved luxuries to American prisoners of war at Narumi, near Nagoya.

The ship returned to Boston for Navy Day, 27 October 1945. On 30 October, &quot;Wasp&quot; moved to the naval shipyard in New York, to have extra accommodations installed for transportation of troops returning from the Pacific. This work was completed on 15 November and enabled her to accommodate some 5,500 enlisted passengers and 400 officers.

===Post-war===

====1947–1955====
After receiving the new alterations, &quot;Wasp&quot; was assigned temporary duty as an Operation Magic Carpet troop transport, bringing Italian POWs back to Italy. On 17 February 1946, &quot;Wasp&quot; ran aground off the coast of New Jersey. On 17 February 1947, she was placed out of commission in reserve, attached to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. In the summer of 1948, &quot;Wasp&quot; was taken out of the reserve fleet and placed in the New York Naval Shipyard for refitting and alterations to enable her to accommodate the larger, heavier, and faster planes of the jet age. Upon the completion of this conversion, the ship was recommissioned on 10 September 1951.

&quot;Wasp&quot; reported to the Atlantic Fleet in November 1951 and began a period of shakedown training which lasted until February 1952. After returning from the shakedown cruise, she spent a month in the New York Naval Shipyard preparing for duty in distant waters. On 26 April 1952, &quot;Wasp&quot; collided with destroyer minesweeper while conducting night flying operations en route to Gibraltar. &quot;Hobson&quot; lost 176 of the crew, including her skipper. Rapid rescue operations saved 52 men. &quot;Wasp&quot; sustained no personnel casualties, but her bow was torn by a 75-foot saw-tooth rip. The carrier proceeded to Bayonne, New Jersey, for repairs, and after she entered drydock there, the bow of aircraft carrier &quot;Hornet&quot; (CV-12)—then undergoing conversion—was removed and floated by barge from Brooklyn, New York, and fitted into position on &quot;Wasp&quot;, replacing the badly shattered forward end of the ship. This remarkable task was completed in only 10 days, enabling the carrier to get underway to cross the Atlantic.

On 2 June 1952, &quot;Wasp&quot; relieved at Gibraltar and joined Carrier Division 6 in the Mediterranean Sea. After conducting strenuous flight operations between goodwill visits to many Mediterranean ports, &quot;Wasp&quot; was relieved at Gibraltar on 5 September by . After taking part in the NATO Exercise Mainbrace at Greenock, Scotland, and enjoying a liberty period at Plymouth, &quot;Wasp&quot; headed home and arrived at Norfolk early on the morning of 13 October 1952. On 7 November 1952, &quot;Wasp&quot; entered the New York Naval Shipyard to commence a seven-month yard period to prepare her for a world cruise which was to bring her into the Pacific Fleet once more. After refresher training in the Caribbean, &quot;Wasp&quot; departed Norfolk on 16 September 1953 to participate in the North Atlantic NATO Exercise &quot;Mariner&quot; before entering the Mediterranean.

After transiting the Suez Canal and crossing the Indian Ocean, making port in Columbo, Ceylon, the carrier made a brief visit to the Philippines and onto Japan and then conducted strenuous operations with the famed TF 77. While operating in the western Pacific, she made port calls at Hong Kong, Manila, Yokosuka, and Sasebo. On 10 January 1954, China&#x27;s Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek spent more than four hours on board &quot;Wasp&quot; watching simulated air war maneuvers in Formosan waters. On 12 March, President Ramon Magsaysay of the Republic of the Philippines came on board to observe air operations as a guest of American Ambassador Raymond A. Spruance. &quot;Wasp&quot; operated out of Subic Bay, Philippines, for a time, then sailed for Japan, where in April 1954, she was relieved by and sailed for her new home port of San Diego.

&quot;Wasp&quot; spent the next few months preparing for another tour of the Orient. She departed the United States in September 1954 and steamed to the Far East, visiting Pearl Harbor and Iwo Jima en route. She relieved &quot;Boxer&quot; in October 1954 and engaged in air operations in the South China Sea with Carrier Task Group 70.2. &quot;Wasp&quot; visited the Philippine Islands in November and December and proceeded to Japan early in 1955 to join TF77. While operating with TF77, &quot;Wasp&quot; provided air cover for the evacuation of the Tachen Islands by the Chinese Nationalists. During this evacuation on 9 February 1955, an AD-5W USN/VC-11 strayed over ROC territory and was shot down. While flying an antisubmarine patrol mission from &quot;Wasp&quot; (CVA 18), this aircraft ditched after sustaining damage from antiaircraft fire when it overflew Chinese territory. The three-man crew was rescued by Nationalist Chinese patrol boats. After the Tachen evacuation, &quot;Wasp&quot; stopped at Japan before returning to San Diego in April. She entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard in May for a seven-month conversion and overhaul. On 1 December, the carrier returned to duty displaying a new angled flight deck and a hurricane bow. As 1955 ended, &quot;Wasp&quot; had returned to San Diego and was busily preparing for another Far Eastern tour.

====1956–1960====
After training during the early months of 1956, &quot;Wasp&quot; departed San Diego on 23 April for another cruise to the Far East with Carrier Air Group 15 embarked. She stopped at Pearl Harbor to undergo inspection and training, and then proceeded to Guam, where she arrived in time for the Armed Forces Day ceremonies on 14 May. En route to Japan in May, she joined TF 77 for Operation Sea Horse, a five-day period of day and night training for the ship and air group. The ship arrived at Yokosuka on 4 June, visited Iwakuni, Japan, then steamed to Manila for a brief visit. Following a drydock period at Yokosuka, &quot;Wasp&quot; again steamed south to Cubi Point, Philippine Islands, for the commissioning of the new naval air station there. Carrier Air Group 15 provided an air show for President Magsaysay and Admiral Arthur Radford. During the third week of August, &quot;Wasp&quot; was at Yokosuka enjoying what was scheduled to be a fortnight&#x27;s stay, but she sailed a week early to aid other ships in searching for survivors of a Navy patrol plane which had been shot down on 23 August off the coast of mainland China. After a futile search, the ship proceeded to Kobe, Japan, and made a final stop at Yokosuka before leaving the Far East.

&quot;Wasp&quot; returned to San Diego on 15 October and while there was reclassified an antisubmarine warfare aircraft carrier CVS-18, effective on 1 November 1956. She spent the last days of 1956 in San Diego preparing for her transfer to the east coast. &quot;Wasp&quot; left San Diego on the last day of January 1957, rounded Cape Horn for operations in the South Atlantic and Caribbean Sea, then proceeded to Boston, where she arrived on 21 March. The carrier came into Norfolk, Virginia, on 6 April to embark members of her crew from the Antisubmarine Warfare School. The carrier spent the next few months in tactics along the Eastern Seaboard and in the waters off Bermuda before returning to Boston on 16 August.

On 3 September, &quot;Wasp&quot; got underway to participate in NATO Operations Seaspray and Strikeback, which took her to the coast of Scotland and simulated nuclear attacks and counterattacks on 130 different land bases. The carrier returned to Boston on 23 October 1957 and entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for a major overhaul, which was not completed until 10 March 1958 when she sailed for antisubmarine warfare practice at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Upon returning to Boston on 29 April and picking up air squadrons at Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island, on 12 May, she became the hub of TF 66, a special antisubmarine group of the 6th Fleet.

The carrier began her Atlantic crossing on 12 May and sailed only a few hundred miles when trouble flared in Lebanon. &quot;Wasp&quot; arrived at Gibraltar on 21 May and headed east, making stops at Souda Bay, Crete, Rhodes, and Athens. &quot;Wasp&quot; next spent 10 days at sea conducting a joint Italian-American antisubmarine warfare exercise in the Tyrrhenian Sea off Sardinia. On 15 July, the carrier put to sea to patrol waters off Lebanon. Her Marine helicopter transport squadron left the ship five days later to set up camp at the Beirut International Airport. They flew reconnaissance missions and transported the sick and injured from Marine battalions in the hills to the evacuation hospital at the airport. She continued to support forces ashore in Lebanon until 17 September 1958, when she departed Beirut Harbor, bound for home. She reached Norfolk on 7 October, unloaded supplies, and then made a brief stop at Quonset Point before arriving in her home port of Boston on 11 October.

Four days later, &quot;Wasp&quot; became the flagship of Task Group Bravo, one of two new antisubmarine defense groups formed by the commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Wasp&quot;″s air squadrons and seven destroyers were supported by shore-based seaplane patrol aircraft. She sailed from Quonset Point on 26 November for a 17-day cruise in the North Atlantic. This at-sea period marked the first time her force operated together as a team. The operations continued day and night to coordinate and develop the task group&#x27;s team capabilities until she returned to Boston on 13 December 1958 and remained over the Christmas holiday season.

&quot;Wasp&quot; operated with Task Group Bravo throughout 1959, cruising along the Eastern Seaboard conducting operations at Norfolk, Bermuda, and Quonset Point. The ship was heavily damaged by an explosion and subsequent fires on 18 August 1959, when a helicopter engine exploded while being tested in hangar bay number one. The fires required two hours to control. At the time of the accident, &quot;Wasp&quot; was carrying nuclear weapons. In the first 30 minutes as the fires burned out of control and the forward magazines were flooded, preliminary preparations were also made to flood the nuclear weapon magazine. This was not done, however, and 30 minutes later, the nuclear weapon magazine reported no significant rise in temperature.

On 27 February 1960, &quot;Wasp&quot; entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for overhaul. In mid-July, the carrier was ordered to the South Atlantic, where she stood by when civil strife broke out in the newly independent Congo and operated in support of the United Nations airlift. She returned to her home port on 11 August and spent the remainder of the year operating out of Boston with visits to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for refresher training and exercises conducted in the Virginia Capes operating areas and the Caribbean operating areas. The carrier returned to Boston on 10 December and remained in port there into the New Year.

====1961–1965====

On 9 January 1961, &quot;Wasp&quot; sailed for the Virginia Capes operating area and devoted the first half of 1961 to exercises there, at Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, and at Nova Scotia. On 9 June, &quot;Wasp&quot; got underway from Norfolk, for a three-month Mediterranean cruise. The ship conducted exercises at Augusta Bay, Sicily; Barcelona, Spain; San Remo and La Spezia, Italy; Aranci Bay, Sardinia; Genoa, Italy; and Cannes, France, and returned to Boston on 1 September. The carrier entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for an interim overhaul and resumed operations on 6 November 1961. After loading food, clothing, and equipment, &quot;Wasp&quot; spent the period 11–18 January 1962 conducting antisubmarine warfare exercises and submarine surveillance off the East Coast. After a brief stop at Norfolk, the ship steamed on to further training exercises and anchored off Bermuda 24–31 January. Wasp then returned to her home port.

On 17 February, a delegation from the Plimoth Plantation presented a photograph of the &quot;Mayflower II&quot; to Captain Brewer, who accepted this gift for &quot;Wasp&#x27;s&quot; &quot;People to People&quot; effort in the forthcoming European cruise. On 18 February, &quot;Wasp&quot; departed Boston, bound for England, and arrived at Portsmouth on 1 March. On 16 March, the carrier arrived at Rotterdam, Netherlands, for a week&#x27;s goodwill visit. From 22 to 30 March, &quot;Wasp&quot; traveled to Greenock, Scotland, thence to Plymouth. On 17 April, Captain Brewer presented Alderman A. Goldberg, Lord Mayor of Plymouth, the large picture of &quot;Mayflower II&quot; as a gift from the people of Plymouth, Massachusetts. On 5 May, &quot;Wasp&quot; arrived at Kiel, West Germany, and became the first aircraft carrier to ever visit that port. The ship made calls at Oslo, Reykjavík, and Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland and Labrador, before returning to Boston, Massachusetts, on 16 June.

From August through October, &quot;Wasp&quot; visited Newport, Rhode Island, New York City, and Naval Weapons Station Earle in New Jersey, then conducted a dependents&#x27; cruise, as well as a reserve cruise, and visitors cruises. On 1 November, &quot;Wasp&quot; used her capabilities when she responded to a call from President John F. Kennedy and actively participated in the Cuban blockade. After tension relaxed, the carrier returned to Boston on 22 November for upkeep work, and on 21 December, she sailed to Bermuda with 18 midshipmen from Boston-area universities. &quot;Wasp&quot; returned to Boston on 29 December and finished out the year there.

The early part of 1963 had &quot;Wasp&quot; conducting antisubmarine warfare exercises off the Virginia Capes and steaming along the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica in support of the presidential visit. On 21 March, President Kennedy arrived at San José for a conference with presidents of six Central American nations. After taking part in fleet exercises off Puerto Rico, the carrier returned to Boston on 4 April. From 11 to 18 May, &quot;Wasp&quot; took station off Bermuda as a backup recovery ship for Major Gordon Cooper&#x27;s historic Mercury space capsule recovery. The landing occurred as planned in the mid-Pacific near Midway Atoll, and carrier picked up Cooper and his &quot;Faith 7&quot; spacecraft. &quot;Wasp&quot; then resumed antisubmarine warfare exercises along the Atlantic Seaboard and in the Caribbean until she underwent overhaul in the fall of 1963 for Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization overhaul in the Boston Naval Shipyard.

In March 1964, the carrier conducted sea trials out of Boston. During April, she operated out of Norfolk and Narragansett Bay. She returned to Boston on 4 May and remained there until 14 May, when she got underway for refresher training in waters between Guantánamo Bay and Kingston, Jamaica, before returning to her home port on 3 June 1964. On 21 July 1964, &quot;Wasp&quot; began a round-trip voyage to Norfolk and returned to Boston on 7 August. She remained there through 8 September, when she headed, via the Virginia Capes operating area, to Valencia, Spain. She then cruised the Mediterranean, visiting ports in Spain, France, and Italy, and returned home on 18 December.

The carrier remained in port until 8 February 1965, and sailed for fleet exercises in the Caribbean. Operating along the Eastern Seaboard, she recovered the Gemini IV astronauts James McDivitt and Ed White and their spacecraft on 7 June after splashdown. Gemini IV was the mission of the first American to walk in space, Ed White. During the summer, the ship conducted search and rescue operations for an Air Force C-121 plane which had gone down off Nantucket. Following an orientation cruise for 12 congressmen on 20–21 August, &quot;Wasp&quot; participated in joint training exercises with German and French forces. From 16 to 18 December, the carrier recovered the astronauts of Gemini VI-A, Wally Schirra and Thomas P. Stafford and its sister craft, Gemini VII, Frank Borman and Jim Lovell—the participants involved in the first-ever manned space rendezvous—after their respective splashdowns, and then returned to Boston on 22 December to finish out the year.

====1966–1967====

On 24 January 1966, &quot;Wasp&quot; departed Boston for fleet exercises off Puerto Rico. En route, heavy seas and high winds caused structural damage to the carrier. She put into Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, on 1 February to determine the extent of her damages and effect as much repair as possible. Engineers flown from Boston decided that the ship could cease &quot;Springboard&quot; operations early and return to Boston. The ship conducted limited antisubmarine operations from 6–8 February prior to leaving the area. She arrived at Boston on 18 February and was placed in restricted availability until 7 March, when her repair work was completed. &quot;Wasp&quot; joined in exercises in the Narragansett Bay operating areas. While the carrier was carrying out this duty, a television film crew from the National Broadcasting Company was flown to &quot;Wasp&quot; on 21 March and stayed on the ship during the remainder of her period at sea, filming material for a special color television show to be presented on Armed Forces Day.

The carrier returned to Boston on 24 March 1966 and was moored there until 11 April. On 27 March, Doctor Ernst Lemberger, the Austrian Ambassador to the United States, visited the ship. On 18 April, the ship embarked several guests of the Secretary of the Navy and set courses for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She returned to Boston on 6 May.
A week later, the veteran flattop sailed to take part in the recovery of the Gemini IX spacecraft. Embarked in &quot;Wasp&quot; were some 66 persons from NASA, the television industry, media personnel, an underwater demolition recovery team, and a Defense Department medical team. On 6 June, she recovered astronauts Lt. Col. Thomas P. Stafford and LCDR Eugene Cernan and flew them to Cape Kennedy. &quot;Wasp&quot; returned their capsule to Boston.

&quot;Wasp&quot; participated in ASWEX III, an antisubmarine exercise which lasted from 20 June through 1 July 1966. She spent the next 25 days in port at Boston for upkeep. On the 25th, the carrier got underway for ASWEX IV. During this exercise, the Soviet intelligence collection vessel, &quot;Agi Traverz&quot;, entered the operation area, necessitating a suspension of the operation and eventual repositioning of forces. The exercise was terminated on 5 August. She then conducted a dependents&#x27; day cruise on 8–9 August, and orientation cruises on 10, 11, and 22 August. After a two-day visit to New York, &quot;Wasp&quot; arrived in Boston on 1 September and underwent upkeep until 19 September. From that day to 4 October, she conducted hunter/killer operations with the Royal Canadian Navy aircraft embarked.

Following upkeep at Boston, the ship participated in the Gemini XII recovery operation from 5 to 18 November 1966. The recovery took place on 15 November when the space capsule splashed down within 3 mi (5 km) of &quot;Wasp&quot;. Captain James A. Lovell and Major Edwin E. &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin were lifted by helicopter hoist to the deck of &quot;Wasp&quot; and there enjoyed two days of celebration. &quot;Wasp&quot; arrived at Boston on 18 November with the Gemini XII spacecraft on board. After off-loading the special Gemini support equipment, &quot;Wasp&quot; spent 10 days making ready for her next period at sea. On 28 November &quot;Wasp&quot; departed Boston to take part in the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s largest exercise of the year, Lantflex-66, in which more than 100 US ships took part. The carrier returned to Boston on 16 December, where she remained through the end of 1966.

&quot;Wasp&quot; served as carrier qualification duty ship for the Naval Air Training Command from 24 January to 26 February 1967 and conducted operations in the Gulf of Mexico and off the east coast of Florida. Noteworthy during this period was the celebration of her 58,000th carrier landing on 10 February 1967 as Ensign Donald Koch carrier qualified with two touch-and-gos and six arrested landings in a T-28C. She called at New Orleans for Mardi Gras 4–8 February, at Pensacola on 11 and 12 February, and at Naval Station Mayport, on 19 and 20 February. Returning to Boston a week later, she remained in port until 19 March, when she sailed for Springboard operations in the Caribbean. On 24 March, &quot;Wasp&quot; joined for an underway replenishment, but suffered damage during a collision with the oiler. After making repairs at Roosevelt Roads, she returned to operations on 29 March and visited Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, and participated in the celebration from 30 March to 2 April which marked the 50th anniversary of the purchase of the Virgin Islands by the United States from Denmark. &quot;Wasp&quot; returned to Boston on 7 April, remained in port four days, then sailed to Earle, New Jersey, to offload ammunition prior to overhaul. She visited New York for three days, then returned to the Boston Naval Shipyard and began an overhaul on 21 April 1967, which was not completed until early 1968.

====1968–1970====
&quot;Wasp&quot; completed her cyclical overhaul and conducted postrepair trials throughout January 1968. Returning to the Boston Naval Shipyard on 28 January, the ship made ready for two months of technical evaluation and training which began early in February. Five weeks of refresher training for &quot;Wasp&quot; began on 28 February, under the operational control of Commander, Fleet Training Group, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On 30 March, &quot;Wasp&quot; steamed north and was in Boston 6–29 April for routine upkeep and minor repairs. She then departed for operations in the Bahamas and took part in Fixwex C, an exercise off the Bermuda coast. The carrier set course for home on 20 May, but left five days later to conduct carrier qualifications for students of the Naval Air Training Command in the Jacksonville, Florida, operations area. On 12 June, &quot;Wasp&quot; and had a minor collision during an underway replenishment. The carrier returned to Norfolk, where an investigation into the circumstances of the collision was conducted. On 20 June, &quot;Wasp&quot; got underway for Boston, where she remained until 3 August when she moved to Norfolk to take on ammunition.

On 15 June, &quot;Wasp&quot;″s home port was changed to Quonset Point and she arrived there on 10 August to prepare for overseas movement. Ten days later, the carrier got underway for a deployment in European waters. The northern European portion of the cruise consisted of several operational periods and port visits to Portsmouth, England; Firth of Clyde, Scotland; Hamburg, Germany; and Lisbon, Portugal. &quot;Wasp&quot;, as part of TG 87.1, joined in the NATO Exercise Silvertower, the largest combined naval exercise in four years. Silvertower brought together surface, air, and subsurface units of several NATO navies. On 25 October 1968, the carrier entered the Mediterranean, and the following day, became part of TG 67.6. After a port visit to Naples, Italy, &quot;Wasp&quot; departed on 7 November to conduct antisubmarine warfare exercises in the Tyrrhenian Sea, Levantine Basin, and Ionian Basin. After loading aircraft in both Taranto and Naples, Italy, &quot;Wasp&quot; visited Barcelona, Spain, and Gibraltar. On 19 December, the ship returned to Quonset Point, and spent the remainder of 1968 in port.

&quot;Wasp&quot; began 1969 in her home port of Quonset Point. Following a yard period which lasted from 10 January through 17 February, the carrier conducted exercises as part of the White Task Group in the Bermuda operating area. The ship returned to Quonset Point on 6 March and began a month of preparations for overseas movement. On 1 April 1969, &quot;Wasp&quot; sailed for the eastern Atlantic and arrived at Lisbon, Portugal, on 16 April. From 21 to 26 April, she took part in joint Exercise Trilant, which was held with the navies of the United States, Spain, and Portugal. One of the highlights of the cruise occurred on 15 May, as &quot;Wasp&quot; arrived at Portsmouth, England, and served as flagship for TF 87, representing the United States in a NATO review by Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip in which 64 ships from the 11 NATO countries participated. After conducting exercises and visiting Rotterdam, Oslo, and Copenhagen, &quot;Wasp&quot; headed home on 30 June, and but for a one-day United Fund cruise on 12 August, remained at Quonset Point until 24 August. The period from 29 August to 6 October was devoted to alternating operations between Corpus Christi, Texas, for advanced carrier qualifications, and Pensacola for basic qualifications, with in-port periods at Pensacola.

A period of restricted availability began on 10 October and was followed by operations in the Virginia Capes area until 22 November. In December, &quot;Wasp&quot; conducted a carrier qualification mission in the Jacksonville operations area which lasted through 10 December. The ship arrived back at Quonset Point on 13 December and remained there for the holidays. The carrier welcomed 1970 moored in her home port of Quonset Point, but traveled over 40,000 mi (60,000 km) and was away from home port 265 days. On 4 January, she proceeded to Earle, NJ, and offloaded ammunition prior to entering the Boston Naval Shipyard for a six-week overhaul on 9 January.

The carrier began a three-week shakedown cruise on 16 March, but returned to her home port on 3 April and began preparing for an eastern Atlantic deployment. &quot;Wasp&quot; reached Lisbon on 25 May 1970 and dropped anchor in the Tagus River. A week later, the carrier got underway to participate in NATO Exercise Night Patrol with units from Canada, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and West Germany. On 8 June, &quot;Wasp&quot; proceeded to Rota, Spain, to embark a group of midshipmen for a cruise to Copenhagen. During exercises in Scandinavian waters, the carrier was shadowed by Soviet naval craft and aircraft. The ship departed Copenhagen on 26 June, and three days later, crossed the Arctic Circle.

On 13 July 1970, &quot;Wasp&quot; arrived at Hamburg, Germany, and enjoyed the warmest welcome received in any port of the cruise. A Visitors&#x27; Day was held, and over 15,000 Germans were recorded as visitors to the carrier. After calls at Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland, &quot;Wasp&quot; got underway on 10 August for operating areas in the Norwegian Sea, as well as a port call in Oslo. The carrier anchored near Plymouth on 28 August, and two days later, sailed for her home port. &quot;Wasp&quot; returned to Quonset Point on 8 September and remained there through 11 October, when she got underway to offload ammunition at Earle, prior to a period of restricted availability at the Boston Naval Shipyard beginning on 15 October. The work ended on 14 December; after reloading ammunition at Earle, &quot;Wasp&quot; returned to Quonset Point on 19 December to finish out 1970.

====1971–1972====
On 14 January 1971, &quot;Wasp&quot; departed Quonset Point with Commander, ASWGRU 2, CVSG-54 and Detachment 18 from Fleet Training Group, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, embarked. After refresher training at Bermuda, she stopped briefly at Rota, then proceeded to the Mediterranean for participation in the National Week VIII exercises with several destroyers for the investigation of known Soviet submarine operating areas. On 12 February, Secretary of the Navy John Chafee visited the carrier accompanied by Commander, 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Isaac C. Kidd Jr. &quot;Wasp&quot; detached early from the National Week exercise on 15 February to support as she steamed toward Gibraltar. Soviet ships trailed &quot;Wasp&quot; and &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; until they entered the Strait of Sicily when the Soviets departed to the east. After a brief stop at Barcelona, &quot;Wasp&quot; began her homeward journey on 24 February and arrived at Quonset Point on 3 March.

After spending March and April in port, &quot;Wasp&quot; got underway on 27 April and conducted a nuclear technical proficiency inspection and prepared for the forthcoming Exotic Dancer exercise which commenced on 3 May. Having successfully completed the week-long exercise, &quot;Wasp&quot; was heading home on 8 May when an ABC television team embarked and filmed a short news report on carrier antisubmarine warfare operations. On 15 May, the veteran conducted a dependents&#x27; day cruise, and one month later, participated in Exercise Rough Ride at Great Sound, Bermuda, which took her to Halifax, Nova Scotia. &quot;Wasp&quot; returned to Quonset Point on 2 July 1971, and spent the next two months in preparation and execution of Exercise Squeeze Play IX in the Bermuda operating area. In August, the ship conducted exercises with an East Coast naval reserve air group while proceeding to Mayport, Florida. She returned to her home port on 26 August and spent the next month there. On 23 September, &quot;Wasp&quot; got underway for Exercise Lantcortex 1-72, which terminated on 6 October. For the remainder of the month, the carrier joined in a crossdeck operation which took her to Bermuda, Mayport, and Norfolk. She arrived back at Quonset Point on 4 November.

Four days later, the carrier set her course for the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., where she was in drydock until 22 November. She then returned to Quonset Point and remained in her home port for the remainder of the year preparing for decommissioning. On 1 March 1972, it was announced that &quot;Wasp&quot; would be decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register after more than 28 years of service. Decommissioning ceremonies were held on 1 July 1972. The ship was sold on 21 May 1973 to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, of New York City, and subsequently scrapped at the former site of the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company shipyard, Kearny, New Jersey. Her anchor is on display at the Freedom Park.

<doc id="392914" wikidata="Q947726" url="?curid=392914" title="Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus">
<text>Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus (Greek: Πομπηιανός; 125 – 193 AD) was a politician and military commander during the 2nd century in the Roman Empire. A general under Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Pompeianus distinguished himself during Rome&#x27;s wars against the Parthians and the Marcomanni. He was a member of the imperial family due to his marriage to Lucilla, a daughter of Marcus Aurelius, and was a key figure during the emperor&#x27;s reign. Pompeianus was offered the imperial throne three times, though he refused to claim the title for himself.

==Early life==
A native of Antioch in Syria, Pompeianus was from relatively humble origins. His father was a member of the equestrian order. As indicated by his name, his family first gained Roman citizenship during the reign of Emperor Claudius. Pompeianus was a &quot;novus homo&quot; (&quot;new man&quot;) as he was the first member of his family to be appointed as a senator.

Much of Pompeianus&#x27; early life has been lost to history. He participated in the Roman–Parthian War of 161–166 under the command of Emperor Lucius Verus, likely as a legionary commander. Sometime prior to the Parthian campaign, he was elevated to the rank of senator. He served with distinction during the war, earning him appointment as suffect consul for the remainder of the year 162 AD.

==Marcomannic Wars==

Following the completion the Parthian campaign, Emperor Marcus Aurelius appointed him military governor of Pannonia Inferior on the empire&#x27;s northern frontier along the Danube River. He likely served from 164 until 168. In late 166 or early 167, a force of 6,000 Lombards invaded Pannonia. Pompeianus defeated the invasion with relative ease, but it marked the beginning of a larger barbarian invasion.

Late in 167, the Marcomanni tribe invaded the empire by crossing in Pannonia. Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus planned a punitive expedition to drive the barbarians back across the Danube River, but due to the effects of the Antonine Plague, the expedition was postponed until early 168. Aided by Pompeianus, the two emperors were able to force the Marcomanni to retreat. Pompeianus&#x27; military skills earned him the confidence of Marcus Aurelius and he quickly became one of the Emperor&#x27;s closest advisors.

As the emperors returned to their winter quarters in Aquileia, Lucius Verus fell ill and died in January 169. Marcus Aurelius arranged for his daughter Lucilla, Verus&#x27; widow, to marry Pompeianus. As son-in-law to the emperor, Pompeianus became a member of the Nerva–Antonine dynasty. The emperor even offered to name Pompeianus &quot;Caesar&quot; and his heir, but Pompeianus declined the title.
Instead, Pompeianus was promoted and served as the emperor&#x27;s chief general during the Marcomannic War. Under his guidance, the exiled senator and fellow Parthian war veteran Pertinax was recalled and joined Pompeianus on his military staff.

Pompeianus&#x27; successes during the Marcomannic War further distinguished him, with the emperor awarding him a second consulship in 173. He took part in a number of military operations in the Danubian region and was still stationed in the region following the death of Marcus Aurelius.

==Under Commodus==
Marcus Aurelius died in 180 AD, and his 18-year-old son Commodus, Pompeianus&#x27; brother-in-law, was proclaimed Roman emperor. Pompeianus tried to persuade Commodus to remain on the Danubian frontier to complete the conquest of the Marcomanni, but Commodus returned to Rome in the autumn of 180.

The relationship between the young emperor and the experienced officer quickly deteriorated. In 182, Lucilla, Pompeianus&#x27; wife and Commodus&#x27; sister, organized a failed assassination attempt against the emperor. Though Commodus executed Lucilla and other members of her family, Pompeianus had not participated in the conspiracy and was spared. Following the conspiracy, Pompeianus withdrew from public life, citing old age, and retired to his estates in Italy. He spent most of his time in the country away from Rome, claiming age and an ailment of the eyes as an excuse.

==Later life==
Commodus was assassinated in 192 AD by members of the Praetorian Guard. Pompeianus returned to Rome once the plot against Commodus succeeded, resuming his seat in the Senate.

Pertinax, who was the urban prefect at the time, offered the throne to Pompeianus, but he declined. The Praetorian Guard then proclaimed Pertinax the emperor, but they assassinated him after only 87 days for attempting to impose order upon the long-undisciplined unit. Senator Didius Julianus bribed the Praetorian Guard to proclaim him emperor, but had difficulty garnering support within the ranks of his own troops. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Julianus asked Pompeianus to become co-emperor with him. Pompeianus again declined, on the grounds of his advanced years and eye problems. Julianus was executed on the orders of Septimius Severus after ruling for only 66 days.

Pompeianus appears to have died sometime in 193. His children survived and prospered as members of an important family: they were the grandchildren of Marcus Aurelius. This prestige was dangerous because the new dynasty of the Severans could have seen them as possible competition. Aurelius, son of Pompeianus, was consul in 209, but was later assassinated at the instigation of Caracalla. Later descendants of Pompeianus would become consuls in 231 and 241.

==In popular culture==
Russell Crowe&#x27;s character Maximus Decimus Meridius in the 2000 film &quot;Gladiator&quot; is loosely based on Pompeianus and others, including Narcissus.

<text>George Hepplewhite (1727? – 21 June 1786) was a cabinetmaker. He is regarded as having been one of the &quot;big three&quot; English furniture makers of the 18th century, along with Thomas Sheraton and Thomas Chippendale. There are no pieces of furniture made by Hepplewhite or his firm known to exist but he gave his name to a distinctive style of light, elegant furniture that was fashionable between about 1775 and 1800 and reproductions of his designs continued through the following centuries. One characteristic that is seen in many of his designs is a shield-shaped chair back, where an expansive shield appeared in place of a narrower splat design.

== Life and work ==
Very little is known about Hepplewhite himself. Some established sources list no birth information; however a &quot;George Hepplewhite&quot; was born in 1727 in Ryton, County Durham, England. According to some sources, he served his apprenticeship with Gillows in Lancaster, but the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; is sceptical about this. He was also a member of the London Society of CabinetMakers.

He based himself in London, where he opened a shop. After he died in 1786, the business was continued by his widow, Alice. In 1788 she published a book with about 300 of his designs, The &quot;Cabinet Maker and Upholsterers Guide&quot;, with two further editions published in 1789 and 1790. It was not until years after his death that his designs started to receive recognition. While some have attempted to attribute the furniture design to his wife Alice, there is no evidence that she was the original creative force behind the work beyond her publication of the reference guide after his death.

With contemporaries such as Thomas Chippendale producing pieces in a variety of styles, Hepplewhite&#x27;s famed style is more easily identifiable. Hepplewhite produced designs that were slender, more curvilinear in shape and well balanced. There are some characteristics that hint at a Hepplewhite design, such as shorter more curved chair arms, straight legs, shield-shape chair backs, all without carving. The design would receive ornamentation from paint and inlays used on the piece.

The book influenced cabinet makers and furniture companies for several generations. The work of these generations influenced in turn copies of the original designs and variants of them through the 19th and 20th centuries.

<text>Death in Vegas are an English electronic music group, for which Richard Fearless serves as frontman. The band was formed in 1994 by Fearless and Steve Hellier and signed to Concrete Records under the name of Dead Elvis. Owing to an Irish record label of the same name, &quot;Dead Elvis&quot; became the title of their first album instead.

==History==
===&quot;Dead Elvis&quot;===
The band&#x27;s debut, &quot;Dead Elvis&quot; (1997), used a blend of musical genres. Most of the tracks are mainly based in electronic dance music. Shortly after the release of the album, Hellier left the band and was replaced by Tim Holmes, who had already been involved with mixing and engineering tracks on the album.

===&quot;The Contino Sessions&quot;===
The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Contino Sessions&quot; (1999), marked a slight change in direction with more attention to live instrumentation than their first and the inclusion of guest vocalists (including Dot Allison, Bobby Gillespie, Iggy Pop, and Jim Reid). Although predominantly rock-influenced, the album still retained some electronic elements, in particular the opening track, &quot;Dirge&quot;, with its drum machine-based rhythm track. &quot;Dirge&quot; was featured on a Levi&#x27;s jeans commercial, as well as the second installment of &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, and was used in the trailer for the 2006 film &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. The song was also used in the trailer for the 2013 film &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; and used in the 2001 film Disco Pigs, at the end of the 2009 remake of &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;, near the end of the &quot;Being Human&quot; episode &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, and in the second episode of season two of &quot;Misfits&quot;. Along with &quot;Aisha&quot; (with vocals from Iggy Pop), &quot;Dirge&quot; helped the band gain more recognition, culminating in a Mercury Music Prize nomination in 2000. &quot;Dirge&quot; was the subject of a lawsuit by the band Five or Six, as it borrowed extensively from their song &quot;Another Reason&quot;. The matter was settled with Five or Six receiving a writing credit. &quot;Aisha&quot; was a top 10 hit in the UK and also featured in the PlayStation 2 title &quot;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec&quot;.

===&quot;Scorpio Rising&quot;===
In September 2002, the band released their third album, &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot;, after almost a three-year gap. During their time off, the band had toured and briefly returned to their techno roots with the track &quot;Scorpio&quot;, which, although not appearing on any album, was included as the B-side of &quot;Hands Around My Throat&quot;, the first single from &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot;. &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; takes its name from the cult avant-garde film of the same name by Kenneth Anger. The lyrics of the title track (featuring vocals from Liam Gallagher) reflected the controversial nature of Anger&#x27;s film. It also borrowed extensively from Status Quo&#x27;s &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot;. The matter was settled once again with Francis Rossi receiving a writing credit. It also continued to attract attention from advertisers and filmmakers with &quot;Hands Around My Throat&quot; being used in a Sony Ericsson advert and appearing on the soundtrack to &quot;The Animatrix&quot;, while the track &quot;Girls&quot; was used on the soundtracks to Sofia Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; and Angela Robinson&#x27;s &quot;D.E.B.S.&quot;, as well as in an episode of the TV show &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; and a commercial for BBC&#x27;s most recent production of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;. This was their last studio album for Concrete Records. Concrete released a best-of album, entitled &quot;Milk It&quot;, in 2004.

===&quot;Satan&#x27;s Circus&quot;===
Death in Vegas set up their own label, Drone Records, and released their fourth album, &quot;Satan&#x27;s Circus&quot;, in 2004.

The melody of Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; and &quot;Kometenmelodie 2&quot; are featured in the tracks &quot;Zugaga&quot; and &quot;Kontroll&quot; respectively. Unlike the previous two albums, &quot;Satan&#x27;s Circus&quot; did not feature any guest vocalists. The album was also released as a limited edition double pack including a live CD, recorded on the &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; tour at the Brixton Academy, London.

=== Oasis album production ===
In late December 2003 Death in Vegas was hired by Oasis to produce some tracks on their sixth album &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot; at Sawmills Studios in Cornwall.

===&quot;Trans-Love Energies&quot;===
The band released their fifth studio album, &quot;Trans-Love Energies&quot;, on 26 September 2011 in the UK. The album featured vocals by Katie Stelmanis of Austra and Richard Fearless.

===&quot;Transmission&quot;===
Death in Vegas&#x27; sixth studio album was released on 27 May 2016 on Fearless&#x27;s Drone Records label, featuring vocals by writer and sex symbol Sasha Grey. The former Throbbing Gristle members Chris &amp; Cosey remixed &quot;Consequences of love&quot;—a &quot;Transmission&quot; song performed and composed by Grey and Fearless—and in 2017 Michael Mayer adapted the Chris &amp; Cosey remix in his DJ-Kicks album. Vice described &quot;Transmission&quot; as an &quot;EBM-inspired romp through the darker edges of the sleazier clubs in the nightlife spectrum&quot;. In a cameo appearance DJ Harvey plays &quot;Consequences of love&quot; in the rave party at the Grand Palais scene of &quot;&quot;.

<text>Samogitia, often known by its Lithuanian name Žemaitija (Samogitian: &quot;Žemaitėjė&quot;; see below for alternative and historical names) is one of the five cultural regions of Lithuania and formerly one of the two core administrative divisions of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania alongside Lithuania proper.

Žemaitija is located in northwestern Lithuania. Its capital city is Telšiai and the largest city is Šiauliai (located on the border between Samogitia and Aukštaitija). Throughout centuries, Samogitia developed a separate culture featuring diverse architecture, folk costumes, dances, songs, traditions, and a distinct Samogitian language.

Famous landmarks include Tauragė Castle, Plungė Manor and Hill of Crosses.

==Etymology and alternative names==
The region is primarily referred to by its Lithuanian name, &quot;Žemaitija&quot;, in both local and national contexts. The Latin-derived term Samogitia, once widely used in historical sources, largely fell out of common administrative and colloquial use in the 19th century. The name Žemaitija, derived from the Lithuanian words &quot;žemas&quot; (&quot;low&quot;) and &quot;žemė&quot; (&quot;land&quot;), translates to &quot;lowlands,&quot; reflecting the region’s geographical characteristics. While Samogitia persists in historical and academic discussions, it is considered an archaic exonym in modern contexts, with Žemaitija remaining the standard designation. 

Ruthenian sources mentioned the region as жемотьская земля, &quot;Žemot&#x27;skaja zemlja&quot;; this gave rise to its Polish form, , and probably to the Middle High German . In Latin texts, the name is usually written as , etc. The region is also known in English as Lower Lithuania or, in reference to its Yiddish names, or .

==Geography==
The largest city is Šiauliai (&quot;Šiaulē&quot;). Telšiai (&quot;Telšē&quot;) is the capital, although Medininkai (now &quot;Varniai&quot;; &quot;Varnē&quot;) was once the capital of the Duchy of Samogitia.

The major cities are:
* Šiauliai (&quot;Šiaulē&quot;) (99,462 inhabitants)
* Mažeikiai (&quot;Mažeikē&quot;) (32,477 inhabitants)
* Tauragė (&quot;Tauragie&quot;) (21,516 inhabitants)
* Telšiai (&quot;Telšē&quot;) (21,294 inhabitants) – considered capital
* Plungė (&quot;Plongė&quot;) (16,750 inhabitants)
* Kretinga (&quot;Kretinga&quot;) (16,580 inhabitants)
* Palanga (&quot;Palonga&quot;) (16,046 inhabitants)
* Gargždai (Gargždā) (15,932 inhabitants)

Samogitia is bordered by Lithuania Minor in the south-west, Suvalkija in the south-east, Aukštaitija in the east, and Semigallia and Courland in the north.

==Subdivisions==

==Demographics and language==

The people of Žemaitija speak Samogitian, a variety of Lithuanian that was previously considered one of three main dialects (modern linguists have determined that it is one of two dialects, the other being the Aukštaitian dialect and that both of these dialects have subdialects each).
Samogitian has northern and southern dialects, which are further subdivided. A western dialect once existed in the Klaipėda region, but it became extinct after World War II after its inhabitants fled the region as a result of being expelled or persecuted by the Soviet authorities.
During the 15th and 16th centuries, the Samogitians of the Klaipėda region called themselves &quot;Lietuvininkai&quot;, whereas at the end of the 19th century when the area, known in German as the Memelland, was part of Prussia (Germany), they were known as &quot;Prūsai&quot;. After World War II, the territory of the western subdialect was resettled mainly by northern and southern Žemaičiai and by other Lithuanians. Samogitian has a broken intonation (&quot;laužtinė priegaidė&quot;, a variant of a start-firm accent) similar to that of the Latvian language. In 2010, the Samogitian language was assigned with an ISO 639-3 standard language code (&quot;sgs&quot;), as some languages, that were considered by ISO 639-2 to be dialects of one language, are now in ISO 639-3 in certain contexts considered to be individual languages themselves.

Žemaitija is one of the most ethnically homogeneous regions of the country, with an ethnic Lithuanian population exceeding 99.5% in some districts. During the first part of the 19th century, Žemaitija was a major center of Lithuanian culture (Žemaičiai traditionally tended to oppose any anti-Lithuanian restrictions). The local religion is predominantly Roman Catholic, although there are significant Lutheran minorities in the south.

The use of the Samogitian language is decreasing as more people tend to use Lithuanian, although there have been some minor attempts by local councils, especially in Telšiai, to write certain roadside information in Samogitian as well some schools teach children Samogitian in schools.

==History==

The modern concept of &quot;dialectological&quot; Žemaitija appeared only by the end of the 19th century. The territory of ancient Samogitia was much larger than current ethnographic or &quot;dialectological&quot; Žemaitija and embraced all of central and western Lithuania. 

The very term &quot;Samogitians&quot; is a Latinized form of the ancient Lithuanian name for the region&#x27;s lowlanders, who dwelt in Central Lithuania&#x27;s lowlands. The original subethnic Samogitia, i.e. Central Lithuania&#x27;s flat burial grounds culture, was formed as early as the 5th-6th centuries. The western part of historical Žemaitija (before 12th–13th centuries it was inhabited by southern Semigallians and southern Curonians) became ethnically Lithuanian between the 13th and 16th centuries. The primal eastern boundary of historical Samogitia was the Šventoji River (a tributary of the Neris River); in 1387, the Lithuanian ruler (regent of Lithuania for Jogaila) Skirgaila had expanded the territory of Grand Duke&#x27;s domain in Aukštaitija along the Nevėžis River at the expense of Žemaitija.

Because during the 13th through 16th centuries the Teutonic Order and the Livonian Order bordered Žemaitija, it was long threatened by their expansionist aims. As such, the Samogitian territory was offered to these orders, or exchanged in peace treaties, a number of times. Lithuania would then regain Žemaitija during subsequent conflicts. For more than two hundred years, old Samogitia played a central role in Lithuania&#x27;s wars against the crusading order of the Teutonic Knights (Knights of the Cross and Knights of the Sword). Invasions started in Lithuania in 1229. Combined military forces undertook numerous campaigns against Samogitians and Lithuanians. Saule (1236), Skuodas (1259), Durbe (1260), Lievarde (1261) are just a few of the battles that took place.

Since Žemaitija was the last pagan region in Europe left to be invaded and christened, the Teutonic Order set their sights on this last mission. Between 1345 and 1382, the Knights of the Cross attacked from Prussia some 70 times, while the Livonian Knights of the Sword made 30 military forays. Year after year, fortresses were attacked, farms and crops were put to the torch, women and children enslaved and men killed. Despite all their effort, the Žemaičiai managed to defend their lands until 1410 decisive Battle of Grunwald or Žalgiris, where united Polish-Lithuanian forces defeated the Teutonic Order and ended their crusading era.
In the 15th century, Samogitia was the last region in Core Europe to be converted to Christianity. During the 15–18th centuries, it was known as the Duchy or Eldership of Samogitia, which included some territories of what is now considered Aukštaitija and Suvalkija as well. The Duchy of Samogitia was an autonomous administrative unit in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with some similarities to a voivodeship. In contrast to some other aristocrats of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Lithuanian language was intensively used in the Duchy of Samogitia and its nobility throughout the early modern period. This is proven by the letter of Stanisław Radziwiłł to his brother Mikołaj Krzysztof Radziwiłł immediately after becoming the Elder of Samogitia that: &quot;While learning various languages, I forgot Lithuanian, and now I see, I have to go to school again, because that language, as I see, God willing, will be needed.&quot;After the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 18th century, Samogitia was incorporated into the Russian Empire along with the rest of Lithuania. Samogitia was the main source of the Lithuanian cultural revival during the 19th century and was a focal point for the smuggling of books printed in the Lithuanian language, which was banned by the occupying Russians.

In 1883, Edmund Veckenstedt published a book &quot;Die Mythen, Sagen und Legenden der Zamaiten (Litauer)&quot; ().

After World War I, Samogitia became a part of the newly re-established Lithuanian state. The Žemaičiai resisted the Bolsheviks and the Bermontians. During World War II, Lithuania was first occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, then in 1941 by Nazi Germany, and in 1944 again by the USSR. The Soviet Union recognized the independence of Lithuania on 6 September 1991. The last Soviet troops withdrew in August 1993.

In 1945, the Soviets denied the existence of the Lithuania Minor ethnographic region, out of political advantage, and declared the Klaipėda region a part of Samogitia.

==Tourism==

Tourist destinations in Samogitia include Palanga, Kretinga and Žemaičių Kalvarija. The majority of tourists come from Latvia, Poland, Belarus, Russia, Germany, Spain, Finland and Sweden.Palanga is a tourist destination among tourists from the United Kingdom, Germany and Russia.

Žemaičių Kalvarija (or New Jerusalem as it used to be called) is visited by pilgrims from all around the world, due to its annual The Great Žemaičių Kalvarija Church Festival (usually in June or July).

==Politics==
Samogitia historically was an autonomous region in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, although it lost this status once Lithuania was annexed by the Russian Empire following the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795 as a part of the Vilnius Governorate. In 1843, Samogitia was incorporated into the Kaunas Governorate, with a minor part attached to the Courland Governorate. Since then, Samogitia has not had a separate political status, but there were attempts to create a separate state during the uprising in February 1831.

Currently, Samogitia is represented by the Samogitian cultural society, a group interested in preserving Samogitian culture and language.

==Symbols==
The coat of arms depicts a black bear with silver claws and a collar on a red shield topped with a crown. The greater arms are supported by a knight with a sword and a woman with an anchor and has the motto &quot;Patria Una&quot; (Latin: One Fatherland). The current emblazonment of the arms was created by artist Algis Kliševičius.

The flag of Samogitia depicts the coat of arms on a white background. It is a swallowtail flag. A variant of the flag charged with the greater coat of arms additionally has a red border around the flag.

Both symbols are assumed to have been used for centuries, especially the coat of arms (differing claims assert it was first used in the 14th or 16th centuries). The symbols were used by the Duchy of Samogitia. These are the oldest symbols of the Lithuanian ethnographic regions. On 21 July 1994, these symbols were recognized by the government of Lithuania. Following their adoption, there has been much controversy revolving around particular details of both the flag and coat of arms of Samogitia.

Because Žemaitija (Samogitia) does not correspond to any current administrative division of Lithuania, these symbols are not officially used anymore. However, the Samogitian bear was used in the coats of arms of Šiauliai County and Telšiai County. It also appears on the arms of the city of Šiauliai.

The emblem of the Lithuanian Armed Forces Motorized Infantry Brigade &quot;Žemaitija&quot; (Samogitia) is the griffin with a sword in his right hand and a shield, which features the Samogitian bear, in his left hand.

<text>François Gilbert Léopold Silly (24 October 1927 – 18 December 2001), known professionally as Gilbert Bécaud (), was a French singer, composer, pianist and actor, known as &quot;Monsieur 100,000 Volts&quot; for his energetic performances. His best-known hits are &quot;Nathalie&quot; and &quot;Et maintenant&quot;, a 1961 release that became an English language hit as &quot;What Now My Love&quot;. He remained a popular artist for nearly fifty years, identifiable in his dark blue suits, with a white shirt and &quot;lucky tie&quot;; blue with white polka dots. When asked to explain his gift he said, &quot;A flower doesn&#x27;t understand botany.&quot; His favourite venue was the Paris Olympia under the management of Bruno Coquatrix. He debuted there in 1954 and headlined in 1955, attracting 6,000 on his first night, three times the capacity. On 13 November 1997, Bécaud was present for the re-opening of the venue after its reconstruction.
==Biography==

Born in Toulon, France, Bécaud learned to play the piano at a young age, and then went to the Conservatoire de Nice. In 1942, he left school to join the French Resistance during World War II. He began songwriting in 1948, after meeting Maurice Vidalin, who inspired him to write his early compositions. He began writing for Marie Bizet; Bizet, Bécaud and Vidalin became a successful trio, and their partnership lasted until 1950.

In 1952, he married Monique Nicholas. They had three children.

While touring with Jacques Pills as a pianist, Bécaud met Édith Piaf, Pills&#x27; wife at the time. He began singing at her suggestion in 1953, with &quot;Mes Mains&quot; and &quot;Les Croix&quot;. His first performance came the year after. His hits in the later part of the decade included &quot;La Corrida&quot; (1956), &quot;Le Jour où la Pluie Viendra&quot; (1957), and &quot;C&#x27;est Merveilleux L&#x27;amour&quot; (1958).

His first hit in the English-speaking world was Jane Morgan&#x27;s cover version of &quot;Le jour où la pluie viendra&quot; (as &quot;The Day the Rains Came&quot;, with English lyrics by Carl Sigman) in 1958. He began acting in the same period, starting with &quot;Le Pays D&#x27;où Je Viens&quot; (1956). In 1960, he won a Grand Prix du Disque and composed &quot;L&#x27;enfant à L&#x27;étoile,&quot; a Christmas cantata. That same year, &quot;Let It Be Me&quot;, an English version of his &quot;Je t&#x27;appartiens&quot;, became a hit for the Everly Brothers, followed, over the years, by Bob Dylan, Nina Simone, Elvis Presley, The 5th Dimension, Willie Nelson, Jerry Butler, Sam &amp; Dave and James Brown.

In 1973 he married Kitty Saint-John, with whom he had two children. He died of cancer at the age of 74.

==Career from 1960==
In 1961, Bécaud wrote and recorded &quot;Et Maintenant&quot;, one of the biggest selling singles in French history. Translated as &quot;What Now My Love&quot;, the song became a hit by Shirley Bassey, Sonny &amp; Cher, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland, Andy Williams, Herb Alpert and Frank Sinatra. 

In 1962, he completed his largest composition, the 2-act opera &quot;L&#x27;Opéra d&#x27;Aran&quot;, which was premiered at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées on 25 October 1962 (Georges Prêtre conductor). The plot of the opera takes place on the Aran Islands, off the west coast of Ireland, although Bécaud had never been to Ireland before.

After the opera&#x27;s performances, he toured Europe and continued recording a string of pop music hits, including &quot;Crois-moi ça durera&quot; and &quot;Tu le regretteras&quot;. He also co-wrote &quot;Love on the Rocks&quot; with Neil Diamond, which was featured on the soundtrack of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and was an international hit. In addition, he co-wrote &quot;September Morn&quot; with Diamond. Other songs he co-wrote with Diamond and are found on the album &quot;The Jazzsinger&quot; are &quot;Summerlove&quot;, &quot;On the Robert E. Lee&quot;,&quot;Hey Louise&quot; and &quot;Songs of Life&quot;.

Marlene Dietrich recorded his &quot;Marie, Marie&quot; and performed it in her stage shows.

He wrote the song &quot;Nathalie&quot; to the text by Pierre Delanoë about a female Moscow guide in 1964. Bécaud visited Moscow in 1965 allegedly invited by students. The Czech writer Bohumil Doležal commented that the song described the guide as a KGB officer. A Russian blogger claimed that guides reported to KGB officers. The song was used to soften the image of the Soviet Union, despite Pierre Delanoë&#x27;s anti-Soviet views.

His song &quot;Seul sur son étoile&quot; became &quot;It Must Be Him&quot; (with English lyrics by Mack David), a hit in 1967 for the American singer Vikki Carr, and the following year another Bécaud song, &quot;L&#x27;important c&#x27;est la rose&quot; was given an English lyric (by Norman Newell) and became a hit for the British singer Vince Hill under the title &quot;Importance of Your Love&quot;.

On 19 June 1968, the American Broadcasting Company aired a half-hour colour special starring Bécaud that had been taped in Saarbrücken. Bécaud performed &quot;Nathalie&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle Lise&quot; and &quot;The Day the Rains Came&quot; and sang a duet with Inge Brück, &quot;Sand and Sea&quot;. The programme also featured performances by João Gilberto, Lill Lindfors and Hans Koller.

Bécaud turned his focus more toward touring than recording in the 1970s. An example was his live performance at the festival The Golden Orpheus in June 1971 in Communist Bulgaria. He followed this with some acting work and at last finally took time off in 1973, citing exhaustion. In 1974, he was named Chevalier in the Légion d&#x27;honneur. The following year, he scored his one and only entry on the UK Singles Chart with &quot;A Little Love and Understanding&quot;, which reached number 10 in the spring. The song also became his first and only chart hit in Australia, reaching number 19 in the winter. Later in the century, he began writing with Pierre Grosz and then Neil Diamond, also penning the Broadway musical &quot;Roza&quot; with Julian More.

In 1982, he recorded the duet &quot;L&#x27;Amour est mort&quot; with Québécoise singer Martine St. Clair at the start of her career.

The 1980s and 1990s, saw a slowdown of Bécaud&#x27;s activity. He released various compilations and toured occasionally.

On 18 December 2001, he died from lung cancer, aged 74, on his houseboat on the Seine, and was interred in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Bécaud&#x27;s song catalogue, running to around 450 songs, is published by BMG Music Publishing.

Bécaud&#x27;s song &quot;L&#x27;Orange&quot; was the featured track in one of the trailers of the movie &quot;Léon&quot; (aka &quot;The Professional&quot;) by Luc Besson.

<doc id="392957" wikidata="Q798232" url="?curid=392957" title="Bachman–Turner Overdrive">
<text>Bachman–Turner Overdrive, often abbreviated BTO, are a Canadian rock band from Winnipeg, Manitoba, founded by three brothers: Randy, Robbie, and Tim Bachman; along with Fred Turner, in 1973. Their 1970s catalogue included seven top-40 albums (five in the US) and 11 top-40 singles in Canada (six in the US). In Canada they have six certified platinum albums and one certified gold album; in the US they have five certified gold albums and one certified platinum album. The band has sold approximately 30 million albums worldwide and has fans affectionately known as &quot;gearheads&quot; (derived from the band&#x27;s gear-shaped logo). Many of their songs, including &quot;Let It Ride&quot;, &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot;, &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot;, &quot;Hey You&quot; and &quot;Roll on Down the Highway&quot;, still receive regular play on classic rock stations.

The original line-up consisted of Randy Bachman (lead guitar, lead vocals), Fred Turner (bass guitar, lead vocals), Tim Bachman (guitar, vocals) and Robbie Bachman (drums, percussion, backing vocals). This line-up released two albums in 1973. The second and most commercially successful line-up featured Blair Thornton (lead guitar), in place of Tim Bachman. This line-up released four albums between 1974 and 1977, including two that reached the top 5 in the U.S. pop charts, as well as the band&#x27;s only U.S. No. 1 single (&quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot;). Subsequent line-ups enjoyed only moderate success.

After the band went into a hiatus in 2005, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner reunited in 2009 to tour and collaborate on a new album. In 2010 they played the halftime show at the Grey Cup in Edmonton. The two stopped touring following Turner&#x27;s amicable retirement in March 2018.

On March 29, 2014, the classic &quot;Not Fragile&quot; line-up reunited for the first time since 1991 to mark Bachman–Turner Overdrive&#x27;s induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, and participated in a tribute performance of &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot;. On January 12, 2023, drummer and co-founder Robbie Bachman died at age 69, followed three months later by his brother, rhythm guitarist Tim on April 28, 2023 (aged 71).

On June 29, 2023, Randy Bachman and the new official Bachman–Turner Overdrive website announced BTO was back on tour. This version of BTO is led by Randy Bachman, with Fred Turner playing select dates. The rest of the group is made up of Randy&#x27;s son, Tal Bachman, and Randy&#x27;s solo touring outfit (who also made up the backing band for Bachman &amp; Turner).

==History==
===Early history: Brave Belt (1971–1973)===
After finding success with The Guess Who, Randy Bachman left at the height of the group&#x27;s popularity in 1970, citing health issues and lifestyle differences with the other band members. He recalled being labelled &quot;a lunatic and a loser&quot; and being told &quot;nobody wanted to work with me.&quot; The exception was Chad Allan, former Guess Who lead singer, who had left that band four years before Randy. The two agreed to explore a musical project, and Randy then turned to family. The result was the band Brave Belt, formed in Winnipeg in 1971 with the additions of Randy&#x27;s brother Robin &quot;Robbie&quot; Bachman on drums, and Gary Bachman acting as band manager. Brave Belt&#x27;s self-titled first album, which had Randy playing both lead guitar and bass, was composed primarily of country-rock songs. The album did not sell particularly well, with only one single (&quot;Crazy Arms, Crazy Eyes&quot;) managing to crack the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; top 40 (#35). The record label still wanted Brave Belt to tour, so Randy (at the suggestion of Neil Young) hired fellow Winnipeg bassist/vocalist C. F. (&quot;Fred&quot;) Turner to perform in the band&#x27;s scheduled gigs.

Turner was soon asked to be a full-time member and sing lead for the recording of &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; in 1972. Chad Allan appeared as a vocalist on two &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; songs, but left the band shortly after the album&#x27;s recording. During the tour to support this album, another Bachman sibling, Tim Bachman, was added as a second guitarist because the band believed its three-piece arrangement was too restrictive. &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; also failed to achieve any notable chart success, and in mid-1972 their supporting tour was cancelled halfway through. But Turner&#x27;s influence had started to make itself felt, as he composed five songs for the &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; album and sang lead on nine of the album&#x27;s eleven songs. &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; had a harder, more riff-heavy sound than its predecessor, complemented by Turner&#x27;s throaty, powerful voice.

According to Randy Bachman&#x27;s autobiography, Bachman–Turner Overdrive&#x27;s sound was born at a university gig in Thunder Bay, Ontario, shortly after Allan&#x27;s departure. A promoter, disheartened with reactions to Allan&#x27;s country-flavoured songs, which the band was still playing, decided to sack Brave Belt for the Saturday night show and bring in a more rock-oriented replacement from Toronto. When the replacement band didn&#x27;t materialize, he begged Brave Belt to stay on and play a set of classic rock cover songs. As the band played songs like &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;All Right Now&quot;, the dance floor filled up and, according to Randy, &quot;We instantly saw the difference between playing sit-down music people could talk over and playing music they would jump out of their seats and dance to.&quot;

Certain that Reprise Records would drop Brave Belt from their label but not wanting to wait, Randy Bachman asked for and received a release from their contract. Randy then emptied his own bank account to finance another set of recordings with the &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; line-up, and began to shop around the next album. Said Randy in 1974, &quot;I went to A&amp;M, Epic, Atlantic, Columbia, Asylum – you name it. A week later, I&#x27;d get letters saying &#x27;Dear Randy, We pass.&#x27; We&#x27;re thinking of calling our greatest hits album &quot;We Pass&quot; and printing all those refusals on the jacket. I&#x27;ve got all 22 of them.&quot;

The band eventually landed a deal with Mercury Records, one which Randy proclaimed as a pure stroke of luck. In April 1973 Charlie Fach of Mercury Records returned to his office after a trip to France to find a stack of demo tapes waiting on his desk. Wanting to start completely fresh, he took a trash can and slid all the tapes into it except one which missed the can and fell onto the floor. Fach picked up the tape and noticed Bachman&#x27;s name on it. He remembered talking to him the previous year and had told Bachman that if he ever put a demo together to send it to him. Coincidentally, Mercury had just lost Uriah Heep and Rod Stewart to other labels, and Fach was looking for new rock acts to replace them. Fach called Bachman, and Randy describes the conversation from there:

===New band name: Bachman-Turner Overdrive===
At this point the band&#x27;s demo tape was still called &quot;Brave Belt III&quot;. Fach convinced the band that a new name was needed, one that capitalized on the name recognition of the band members. The band had already mulled over using their surnames (à la Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young). While on their way back from a gig in Toronto, the group had spotted a copy of a trucker&#x27;s magazine called &quot;Overdrive&quot; while dining at the Colonial Steak House in Windsor, Ontario. After this, Turner wrote &quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive&quot; and the initials &quot;B.T.O.&quot; on a napkin. The rest of the band decided the addition of &quot;Overdrive&quot; was the perfect way to describe their music.

BTO released their eponymous first album in May 1973. The album broke through in the US via border towns such as Detroit and Buffalo and stayed on the charts for many weeks despite lacking a hit single. The Turner-penned &quot;Blue Collar&quot; reached No. 21 on the Canadian RPM charts, but stalled at No. 68 on the US charts. The album&#x27;s eventual success was very much the result of the band&#x27;s relentless touring. Reportedly, Fach had agreed to put this album on the Mercury label only if the band would promote it with a heavy concert schedule. Wherever the band was getting significant airplay, Bachman–Turner Overdrive immediately traveled there, regardless of the tour routing, to build momentum.

One such opportunity occurred in St. Louis, Missouri. Fred Turner said, &quot;We got a call from radio station KSHE that was putting on a benefit. They wanted a band to headline that nobody heard of because the headline acts they had booked got bigger offers and weren&#x27;t coming. We had the &quot;BTO I&quot; album out then, so they at least had something to play and make it look like we were big. They started playing our record every hour, every cut off the album, across six states – 150,000 watts. The record company called and said, &#x27;What the hell&#x27;s happening? We shipped ten thousand records to St. Louis in one week!&#x27; We got there and it was an outdoor drive-in theatre, fifteen to twenty thousand people. The region had been saturated with our album. They didn&#x27;t know we were Canadian, they just knew the songs. It was incredible.&quot;

Backed by manager Bruce Allen (who replaced Randy&#x27;s brother Gary in 1972 when Gary was unable to relocate to Vancouver with the rest of Brave Belt), BTO logged over 300 dates in its first year of existence, and it paid off. &quot;BTO I&quot; would later be certified gold in 1974 by the Recording Industry Association of America.

===Breakthrough and success 1973–1976===
BTO&#x27;s second album, &quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive II&quot;, was released in December 1973 and became an enormous hit in the US (peaking at No. 4 in 1974) and their native Canada (peaking at No. 6 on the &quot;RPM&quot; albums chart). Alternate titles considered for the album were &quot;Adrenaline Rush&quot; and &quot;Heavy Duty&quot;. It also yielded two of their best-known hit singles, &quot;Let It Ride&quot; and &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot;. While &quot;Let It Ride&quot; was BTO&#x27;s first Top 40 hit in the U.S. (peaking at No. 23), &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot; would become one of the band&#x27;s most enduring anthems. Randy had already written the core of &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot; several years earlier as &quot;White Collar Worker&quot; while in The Guess Who, but that band had felt it was not their type of song. It reappeared in BTO&#x27;s repertoire during the supporting gigs for the first album primarily, as Randy put it, &quot;To give Fred Turner a chance to rest his voice.&quot; Randy had heard DJ Daryl Burlingham say the day before a gig, &quot;We&#x27;re takin&#x27; care of business on CFUN radio&quot;, and he decided to insert the lyrics &quot;takin&#x27; care of business&quot; into the chorus where &quot;white collar worker&quot; previously existed.

Tim Bachman left the band in early 1974 shortly after the release of &quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive II&quot;. Randy Bachman had very strong religious beliefs and established rules to be in BTO. Among them was a rule that drugs, alcohol and premarital sex were prohibited on tour, and Tim is alleged to have broken all of these. It is said that he was given opportunities to change his lifestyle and did, at least temporarily. Said Randy in a 1974 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview: &quot;I know from experience what can ruin a good thing. Drugs made the guys in The Guess Who change. They got sloppy. They ruined themselves and their marriages.&quot; Some other accounts state that Tim left because he wanted to study record engineering and concert promotion. Tim himself lamented that during a months-long stretch on the road, he was only able to see his infant son a total of three days. In a 2002 interview, brother Robbie said, &quot;He was basically asked to leave. He wasn&#x27;t BTO caliber [and] it was difficult to rely on him. I guess the band was conflicting with his whole life.&quot;

BTO continued a very busy tour schedule and during the supporting tour for &quot;BTO II&quot;, Tim was replaced by Blair Thornton. Thornton had been in the Vancouver-based band Crosstown Bus, which released one album on MCA records. In September 1974, the first BTO album with the modified line-up, &quot;Not Fragile&quot; (a play on the hit album &quot;Fragile&quot; by Yes), was released. It became a huge success, reaching No. 1 on both the Canadian and US album charts. It included the No. 1 single &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot; and AOR favourite &quot;Roll on Down the Highway&quot; (No. 14 &quot;Billboard&quot;, No. 4 &quot;RPM&quot;). &quot;Not Fragile&quot; remains BTO&#x27;s top-selling non-compilation album, selling over eight million copies to date.

1975 found the band engaged in highly successful tours of Europe and the US, wherein BTO was supported by Thin Lizzy, an emerging band also on the Mercury Records label. Said Randy, &quot;Lizzy were just opening in England, but our label wanted to bust them in the rest of Europe and break them wide open in the States, so we toured with Phil and the boys for seven or eight months.&quot; With management pressure to capitalize on their growing success, BTO quickly recorded &quot;Four Wheel Drive&quot; in May 1975, which included the single &quot;Hey You&quot;. Although reaching no higher than No. 21 on the US charts, &quot;Hey You&quot; would become BTO&#x27;s second No. 1 single on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; charts. Meanwhile, the album charted in the Top Five in both the US and Canada.

Following a cross-Canada tour in the summer of 1975, which garnered caustic comments from the Canadian press as BTO had spent most of the last 18 months in the US, the band members were already developing songs for the next album. BTO went on to record &quot;Head On&quot;, releasing it in December 1975. This album produced the 1976 Top 40 single &quot;Take It Like a Man&quot;, which featured a guest appearance by Little Richard who wailed away on his piano. &quot;Head On&quot; also featured the jazzy Randy Bachman composition &quot;Lookin&#x27; Out for No. 1&quot;, which reached No. 15 on the Adult Contemporary chart. While garnering some airplay on traditional rock stations, it also received fairly heavy rotation on soft rock stations which normally did not play bands like BTO. In between the latter two albums, BTO released their only non-album single &quot;Down to the Line&quot;. This song would appear on some of the later compilation CDs, as well as on re-issues of the &quot;Head On&quot; album in CD format. &quot;Head On&quot; would be the last BTO studio album to chart in the US Top 40, peaking at No. 23 in early 1976, while also climbing to No. 3 in Canada.

The first BTO compilation album, &quot;Best of B.T.O. (So Far)&quot;, was released in July 1976 and featured songs from each of the band&#x27;s first five studio albums. A single—a re-release of &quot;Gimme Your Money Please&quot;—was put out from this album, and it also charted well keeping BTO on both the AM &amp; FM airwaves. Although peaking at only No. 19 on the charts, this compilation album became the best-selling Bachman–Turner Overdrive album to date, reaching Double Platinum status in the US.

===Randy&#x27;s departure and the new &quot;BTO&quot; 1977–1979===

&quot;Freeways&quot;, BTO&#x27;s sixth studio album that was recorded in late 1976 and released in February 1977, signaled the end of BTO&#x27;s most successful line-up. Facing some criticism for the &quot;sameness&quot; of the band&#x27;s songs on the two follow-up albums to &quot;Not Fragile&quot;, Randy Bachman wanted to update BTO&#x27;s sound, including adding horns and strings on some songs, but the rest of the band seemed to disagree. Said Fred Turner:

Years later, Randy seemed to agree with Turner, stating, &quot;Looking at it now, we should have taken four, five, six months off ... live a little, and then come back together with new ideas. In retrospect, that&#x27;s what a lot of great bands do. And we didn&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;Freeways&quot; reached No. 34 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; chart but only reached No. 70 on the US pop albums chart. It contained no charting singles.

Randy Bachman left the group in May 1977, three months after the release of &quot;Freeways&quot;. His initial intention was to temporarily disband while he worked on a solo project, &quot;But it was decided by management it wouldn&#x27;t work.&quot; He conceded, &quot;We also ran out of common interests.&quot; Robbie Bachman noted that the band had scheduled a meeting wherein he, Fred and Blair were going to discuss getting back to their rock and roll roots following the relative failure of &quot;Freeways&quot;. Randy then shocked the rest by saying he was leaving, despite the fact that BTO was still under contract with Mercury to release two more albums over the next 18 months.

Randy was replaced by bassist Jim Clench, formerly of April Wine. Bassist Turner moved to rhythm guitar with Thornton becoming the primary lead guitarist. Clench and Turner shared lead vocal duties. Even though this line-up included drummer Robbie Bachman, the band had to record and tour only as &quot;BTO&quot; because of an agreement with Randy who wanted to retain the rights to his surname for his solo career. While Randy kept the rights to the full Bachman name, the remaining band members bought the rights to &quot;BTO&quot; and its trademarks, including the gear logo. The re-structured BTO released &quot;Street Action&quot; in February 1978. The album became a commercial failure, missing the Top 100 on the US album charts and spawning no hit singles.

The band also released &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Nights&quot; in March 1979. It was the first BTO album to prominently feature outside songwriters, particularly Prism&#x27;s Jim Vallance, who also co-produced the album. Vallance had taken over as main producer after Barry Mraz was fired by the band, and would later score huge success in the 80s with Bryan Adams. But like its predecessor, &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Nights&quot; also sold poorly (an estimated 350,000 copies worldwide). The album did, however, produce a moderately successful single called &quot;Heartaches&quot;. Written by Turner, it cracked the Top 40 in Canada and reached number 60 on the US charts, making it the first BTO single in three years to chart in the US. BTO played this song on American Bandstand in February 1979 (with producer Vallance guesting on piano), along with another single from the same album called &quot;Jamaica&quot;. Fred Turner and Jim Clench also appeared on &quot;Bryan Adams&quot;&#x27; debut album in 1980 as session musicians. (Adams had written one song, &quot;Wastin&#x27; Time&quot;, for BTO&#x27;s &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Nights&quot; album; Adams&#x27; own version of the song would appear a year later on his debut album.)

===Disbandment, side projects, and reunions 1979–1991===

BTO completed a relatively successful 80-date tour for &quot;Street Action&quot; through late 1978. But there was only one show for &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Nights&quot;, at Victoria Memorial Arena in Victoria, BC on April 7, 1979, and they officially disbanded by early 1980. After Randy recorded the solo album &quot;Survivor&quot; in 1978, he went on to form the short-lived Ironhorse in 1979. Ironhorse released two albums, &quot;Ironhorse&quot; and &quot;Everything Is Grey&quot;, before disbanding. Tom Sparks was the vocalist for the first Ironhorse album, along with Randy, but was replaced by Frank Ludwig for the second album in 1980. Sparks reportedly did not like the constant touring and being away from home for such long amounts of time. A reformed version of Ironhorse, renamed as &quot;Union&quot;, released one album in 1981 entitled &quot;On Strike&quot;. Fred Turner was a member of Union along with Randy. The album sold poorly, as Randy was wrapped up in a bitter divorce and custody battle and thus unable to tour to support the release.

BTO reunited in 1983. Their line-up for their first studio LP in five years (released in 1984) consisted of Randy and Tim Bachman, Fred Turner and former Guess Who drummer Garry Peterson, who were joined by Billy Chapman, their drum tech, on keyboards. Younger brother Robbie Bachman declined to participate after business and trademark disagreements with Randy and the others:

In Randy&#x27;s 2000 autobiography, &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot;, he counters that Robbie declined to participate in the reunion when he and Fred refused to share in the publishing royalties of the hit BTO songs Randy and Fred authored.

The new album, simply (and confusingly) titled &quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive&quot;, was released in September 1984 on Charlie Fach&#x27;s new Compleat label. &quot;For the Weekend&quot;, a song from this album, was released as a single and had a companion music video. It dented the US charts at No. 83, making it the first chart appearance by a BTO song in five years, and also the last.

In July 1986 they released a live album, recorded at The Moon in Tallahassee, Florida, on August 1, 1985, called &quot;Live! Live! Live!&quot; which featured two new tracks, &quot;Bad News Travels Fast&quot; and &quot;Fragile Man&quot;. The latter was actually a studio recording with the audience sound added to it. A studio version of &quot;Bad News Travels Fast&quot; was released on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Body Slam&quot;. They were the opening band for the new Sammy Hagar-fronted Van Halen on their &quot;5150&quot; tour in 1986. This plum opening slot was done by a trio line-up of Randy, Tim and Garry Peterson (allegedly with some bass parts and Fred&#x27;s voice provided via tapes) since Fred Turner had been unavailable when the group was first contacted by Van Halen&#x27;s management. Chapman later stepped in as drummer for Peterson after the latter severely injured his leg while playing softball during the group&#x27;s downtime on the road.

After the Van Halen tour ended, Randy split and Tim kept going briefly as BTO (see lineups below). The others reluctantly gave him permission to do so to get his way out of debt. Billy Chapman briefly drummed in Tim&#x27;s lineup and later became the drummer for Randy Bachman&#x27;s band and appeared on Randy&#x27;s 1993 solo album Any Road.

In 1988 the 1974–77 &quot;Not Fragile&quot; line-up (Randy, Fred, Blair, Robbie) reformed once again, took to the road and recorded an unknown number of songs together. The only song to make it out into the public by this version of the band was a cover of the song &quot;Wooly Bully&quot;, which is only available on the &quot;American Boyfriends&quot; movie soundtrack. But by late 1991, Randy Bachman had left the group again. Two explanations exist for this happening. The first, according to Randy Bachman, was that the band agreed to take a break. But at some point the other members decided they wanted to continue doing concerts because the money was too good to pass up. Randy stated they asked him to tour with them but he was working on his solo project and had to decline. The others then chose to go on as BTO without him. In the second explanation, the other members (particularly Robbie and Blair) have maintained that Randy quit.

===&quot;Trial by Fire&quot; era (1991–2005)===
Randy Bachman was replaced by Randy Murray after his second departure from the band in late 1991. (Murray had been in Tim Bachman&#x27;s 1987–88 touring incarnations of BTO.) This reconstituted version of BTO (Murray with Robbie Bachman, Fred Turner and Blair Thornton) proved to be its most enduring as they toured together from 1991 until December 2004. &quot;Trial by Fire: Greatest and Latest&quot; was released in 1996 and was their last album to contain any new material.

The sibling rivalry between Robbie and Randy that had started with the 1984 reunion album continued during this era. Said Randy in a 1999 interview, &quot;They said, &#x27;We&#x27;ll just call ourselves BTO. People will know you&#x27;re not there.&#x27; The problem is when BTO pulls into town, the radio, the press people, call them Bachman-Turner Overdrive. It&#x27;s like Coke and Coca-Cola, two names that go hand in hand. It kind of gets represented that I&#x27;m there and when they play the gig, I clearly am not there. [And] they&#x27;ve got another guy to take my place who unfortunately is named Randy. So there&#x27;s this inference that I&#x27;m there and I&#x27;m not there, which is a disservice to the fans.&quot; Replied brother Robbie, &quot;Randy Murray doesn&#x27;t fill anyone&#x27;s shoes. He brings his own.&quot;

In 2003 the Canadian Music Hall of Fame voted to induct Bachman–Turner Overdrive into the museum. However, the band would have had to play as the &quot;Not Fragile&quot; line-up, meaning the inclusion of Randy Bachman to the band for that performance. The current version of BTO at the time declined the invitation unless they could be inducted as &quot;BTO&quot; without Randy Bachman playing on stage. The Hall refused and the band was not inducted. (The &quot;classic&quot; line-up of Randy Bachman, Fred Turner, Blair Thornton and Robbie Bachman would eventually be inducted - by astronaut Chris Hadfield - in 2014.)

In an interview in 2004, Rob Bachman had stated that BTO was working on nine or ten new songs. It has been reported from numerous sources that the band could not get a good label to release the project and wanted this album to be distributed and publicized well, unlike what happened to the &quot;Trial by Fire&quot; CD. There was also a plan to release a live DVD/CD from a show in 2003 in their hometown of Winnipeg, but thus far this has not happened.

===Hiatus 2005–2009===
After the 2005 disbandment of the band, several of their albums were reissued. The first one to be made available again after the disbandment was &quot;Freeways&quot; in 2005, followed by &quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive II&quot; in 2006 and &quot;Four Wheel Drive&quot; in 2008. &quot;Brave Belt I&quot; and &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; were re-released on a single CD March 17, 2009.

Although Rob and Blair remained very reticent about BTO since late 2004, Rob had been rumoured to state he no longer wished to play in the band and had hung up his drum sticks. On January 10, 2023, Robbie Bachman died at age 69.

On January 23, 2009, Tim Bachman played on stage at one of Randy Bachman&#x27;s shows, the first time they had together since 2003. Randy Bachman, who already hosted the successful radio show &quot;Randy&#x27;s Vinyl Tap&quot;, was slated to be the host of a new television show called &quot;Road to Guitar&quot;, which was set to air on the Discovery Channel. He was on tour with Burton Cummings during the summer of 2009, and played dates for the Randy Bachman Band in the United States and Canada for August and September.

Throughout his tenure in BTO and up until 2017, Randy Murray played bar gigs and casual shows around the Vancouver area. He began working in Anglican Church communications in 2002. He is currently the Communications Officer of the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster and retired from music in 2017. He is the only &quot;Trial by Fire&quot;–era member of BTO, besides Fred Turner, to have played shows after the disbandment in January 2005. Like Rob, Murray has also stated he no longer wishes to be in BTO.

===Bachman and Turner reunion 2009–2018===

Due to the intense interest in a Bachman-Turner reunion, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner announced their reteaming on December 8, 2009, in their hometown of Winnipeg.

Information on the 2010 Bachman &amp; Turner tour and the new album was provided at their then-new website &quot;bachmanandturner.com&quot;. As Randy wrote on the site, the project started with his request to Turner that he sing lead on the song, &quot;Rock &#x27;n Roll Is the Only Way Out&quot;. But after hearing the track with Turner&#x27;s vocals, Randy asked if his former bandmate could contribute more vocals and some original compositions and offered to put his solo project on hold in favour of a Bachman-Turner album. It morphed into a full-blown collaboration.

On September 12, 2009, the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; had already reported that Randy Bachman and C.F. Turner would reunite to play concert dates in Europe, Canada and the US in 2010 backed by Randy&#x27;s current band of Marc LaFrance, Mick Dalla-Vee and Brent Howard, billed simply as Bachman &amp; Turner. Some early confirmed tour dates announced were June 2010 at the Sweden Rock Festival and the High Voltage Festival in July 2010 at London UK; the story added that there was also interest from agents as far away as South America and Australia.

Bachman &amp; Turner&#x27;s tour and album plans resulted in a lawsuit by Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton regarding ownership of the band name and related trademarks. Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton claim that US and Canadian rights in the BTO name and trademark were transferred to Rob Bachman, Blair Thornton and Fred Turner when Randy Bachman commenced a solo career in 1977. Randy Bachman is said to have registered the names &quot;Bachman-Turner&quot;, &quot;BTU&quot;, &quot;Bachman-Turner United&quot; and &quot;Bachman-Turner Union&quot; in both the United States and Canada. These names are said to cause confusion with the names &quot;Bachman-Turner Overdrive&quot; and &quot;BTO&quot;, resulting in potential damages to Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton. There appeared to be general legal agreement that one could perform under one&#x27;s own legal names such as &quot;Bachman &amp; Turner&quot;, so the newly reunited pair were billed as such for the 2010 tour and album. The band played the halftime show at the 2010 Grey Cup in Edmonton.

The rock duo&#x27;s self-titled album, &quot;Bachman &amp; Turner&quot;, was released September 7, 2010 in North America and on September 20, 2010, in Europe. In November 2010 they performed at the famous Roseland Ballroom in New York City as part of their North American tour. A double live album, &quot;Live at the Roseland Ballroom, NYC&quot;, was recorded at that show, which was also filmed and released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2012.

Capitalizing on the recent Bachman &amp; Turner album and supporting shows, BTO released another compilation set in 2013, &quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive: 40th Anniversary&quot;, with 26 songs on two CDs. Much of the collection had been released before, but there were four previously unreleased songs, including &quot;Rough Ride&quot; from the 1984 &quot;BTO&quot; reunion album sessions and &quot;West Coast Turnaround&quot; from the 1975 &quot;Head On&quot; sessions. The CD set also features one Brave Belt song (&quot;Never Comin&#x27; Home&quot;), and eight songs on disc two are from the long out-of-print &quot;B.T.O. Live – Japan Tour&quot; album from 1976. Disc two also adds live versions of &quot;Blue Collar&quot; and &quot;Give It Time&quot;, recorded at the same Japan concerts but not released on the LP edition. On March 10, 2018, Randy Bachman announced that Fred Turner would be retiring from touring.

===Resumption of Bachman-Turner Overdrive===
In June 2023 Randy announced a resuming of Bachman–Turner Overdrive, in honor of their 50th Anniversary, with a lineup consisting of the backup members of Bachman &amp; Turner (who had also been backing him solo as well): Mick Dalla-Vee (vocals, bass), Marc LaFrance (vocals, drums, percussion) and Brent Howard Knudsen (vocals, guitar), along with Randy&#x27;s son Tal Bachman, who had previously achieved success as a solo artist, on vocals, guitar and piano. The new lineup also toured in the fall of 2023, with more dates following in early 2024. Bruce Allen, Blair Thornton and Fred Turner gave the new lineup their blessing, with Turner slated to appear with them on a new BTO album and possibly guesting on some tour dates as well.

===Band member deaths===
On November 3, 2010, Jim Clench died at age 61 in a Montreal hospital after a battle with stage-four lung cancer.

Robbie Bachman died on January 12, 2023, aged 69. Less than four months later, on April 28, 2023, Tim Bachman died at age 71 after battling cancer.

==Impact and influence==
BTO has been recognized in many music circles for carrying on the torch of guitar-heavy rock and roll at a time when soft rock was dominating the Top 40 charts, and progressive and glam acts were getting an increasing share of FM radio play. As drummer Rob Bachman put it: &quot;We were basically fans of all kinds of music, but really liked the old kind of rock-and-roll...like Elvis and the funky kinds of rock bands like The Stones. Luckily for us, Creedence had just called it quits, and we came out with three- and four-chord rock-and-roll with Fred Turner&#x27;s gruff voice. So it was basically this working man&#x27;s kind of rock-and-roll.&quot;

A reviewer assesses, however, that critics are divided over BTO&#x27;s legacy:

Stated John Einarson, author of the biography &quot;Randy Bachman: Still Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot;, &quot;If The Guess Who made Canadian music North American, Bachman-Turner Overdrive made it international, earning gold and platinum records not only in the US and Canada, but in Sweden, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, among others.&quot;

After accusing BTO of &quot;shamelessly stealing riffs from the Rolling Stones, The Doobie Brothers and anyone else who happened to be handy,&quot; &quot;Toronto Star&quot; critic Craig MacInnis acknowledged, &quot;They knew how to put the hooks in all the right places, led by the urgent fretwork of Randy Bachman and the gravel vocal stylings of Turner, whose voice resembles a fully-revved Harley-Davidson.&quot;

Stephen King derived his Richard Bachman pen name from Bachman–Turner Overdrive, stating he was listening to the band&#x27;s song &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot; at the time his publisher asked him to choose a pseudonym on the spot.

The band was featured in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Saddlesore Galactica&quot;, which has Randy and Fred voicing their own characters as BTO makes a reunion tour appearance in Springfield.

Randy Bachman and Fred Turner also appeared in the 2012 comedy movie &quot;The Campaign&quot;, making a cameo performing the song &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot;.

The song &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot; was also the title of a 1990 movie starring Jim Belushi as an escaped convict who wins tickets to see the Chicago Cubs in the World Series and finds the Filofax of businessman Charles Grodin. The song serves as the theme song to the movie.

The track &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot; was featured as part of a running joke in the Harry Enfield sketch &quot;Smashie and Nicey&quot; in the early 1990s, with the duo playing the song to end almost every show.

The band is referenced in the 1994 novel &quot;Shoedog&quot; by George Pelecanos.

<doc id="392958" wikidata="Q4958348" url="?curid=392958" title="Brave Belt">
<text>Brave Belt was a Canadian rock band from Winnipeg, Manitoba originally consisting of Randy Bachman (guitar/vocals), his former Guess Who bandmate, Chad Allan (vocals/keyboards), and Randy&#x27;s brother Robbie (drums). Randy also provided bass tracks for the recording of the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Brave Belt&quot; (Reprise Records, 1971). C. F. &quot;Fred&quot; Turner was added shortly after as bassist for the supporting concerts.

The band made the Canadian Top 40 with the minor hit &quot;Crazy Arms, Crazy Eyes,&quot; which peaked at No. 35 in November 1971. However, they missed the U.S. charts completely.

==History==
In 1972, Turner became the lead vocalist for the &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; album. Allan left the band after the recording was completed. During the supporting concerts for &quot;Brave Belt II&quot;, Tim Bachman was added as a second guitarist. Despite the changes, &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; sold poorly and the band struggled to book live shows. In a 1974 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Randy estimated there were losses of about $150,000 in 1971-72 ($923,000 in 2020 dollars), with himself personally absorbing about 60% of the loss, as he was paying the other band member salaries from his Guess Who royalties.

Although dropped from the Reprise label, the &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; lineup (C. F. Turner with Randy, Tim and Robbie Bachman) recorded and shopped around a demo that was supposed to be a &quot;Brave Belt III&quot; album. New management convinced them to change their name − they eventually settled on Bachman–Turner Overdrive.

Thus, the eponymous first Bachman–Turner Overdrive album is essentially &quot;Brave Belt III&quot;, the album that was rejected by Reprise Records. Bachman had contacted many record labels to get the &quot;Brave Belt III&quot; tapes signed. Charlie Fach at Mercury eventually listened to the tapes and liked what he heard. Bachman listened to some suggestions, remixed and re-edited the tapes, and the band recorded at least two new songs. The result was the first Bachman–Turner Overdrive album for Mercury, released in May 1973.

==Legacy==
Though Brave Belt is relatively unknown some 40 years later, the importance of the band was summed up by Randy Bachman in a 2001 interview:
&quot;It was an innocent time of soul-searching. Nobody would play with me when I left The Guess Who. I was completely black-listed. I couldn&#x27;t get a decent musician to play with me, except Chad Allan, who had also been in The Guess Who and left. He and I bonded together, and I might not have gotten started without him, even though he left sometime after that first album. Those [Brave Belt] albums are so important to me because, for the first time, I was making my own music, paying for it, finding strengths in it, and going through the process of finding the right music for the record. It led to me becoming a stronger producer for BTO.&quot;

&quot;Brave Belt I&quot; and &quot;Brave Belt II&quot; were re-released on a single CD March 17, 2009.

<doc id="392963" wikidata="Q1650061" url="?curid=392963" title="Trinomial nomenclature">
<text>In biology, trinomial nomenclature is the system of names for taxa below the rank of species. These names have three parts. The usage is different in zoology and botany.

==In zoology==
In zoological nomenclature, a trinomen (), trinominal name, or ternary name is the name of a subspecies. 

A trinomen is a name with three parts: generic name, specific name and subspecific name. The first two parts alone form the binomen or species name. All three names are typeset in italics, and only the first letter of the generic name is capitalised. No indicator of rank is included: in zoology, subspecies is the only rank below that of species. For example: &quot;&quot;Buteo jamaicensis borealis&quot; is one of the subspecies of the red-tailed hawk (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;).&quot;

Examples include &quot;Gorilla gorilla gorilla&quot; (Savage and Wyman, 1847) for the western lowland gorilla and &quot;Gorilla gorilla diehli&quot; (Matschie, 1903) for the Cross River gorilla (which are subspecies of &quot;Gorilla gorilla&quot;, the western gorilla); &quot;Bison bison bison&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) for the plains bison and &quot;Bison bison athabascae&quot; (Rhoads, 1898) for the wood bison (which are subspecies of &quot;Bison bison&quot;, the American bison).

In a taxonomic publication, a name is incomplete without an author citation and publication details. This indicates who published the name, in what publication, and the date of the publication. For example: &quot;&quot;Phalacrocorax carbo novaehollandiae&quot; (Stephens, 1826)&quot; denotes a subspecies of the great cormorant (&quot;Phalacrocorax carbo&quot;) introduced by James Francis Stephens in 1826 under the subspecies name &quot;novaehollandiae&quot; (&quot;of New Holland&quot;).

If the generic and specific name have already been mentioned in the same paragraph, they are often abbreviated to initial letters. For example, one might write: &quot;The great cormorant &quot;Phalacrocorax carbo&quot; has a distinct subspecies in Australasia, the black shag &quot;P. c. novaehollandiae&quot;&quot;.

While binomial nomenclature came into being and immediately gained widespread acceptance in the mid-18th century, it was not until the early 20th century that the current unified standard of nomenclature was agreed upon. This became the standard mainly because of tireless promotion by Elliott Coues – even though trinomina in the modern usage were pioneered in 1828 by Carl Friedrich Bruch and around 1850 were widely used especially by Hermann Schlegel and John Cassin. As late as the 1930s, the use of trinomina was not fully established in all fields of zoology. Thus, when referring especially European works of the preceding era, the nomenclature used is usually not in accord with contemporary standards.

==In botany==
For algae, fungi, plants, and their fossils, there is an indeterminate number of infraspecific ranks allowed below the level of species. The secondary ranks below the species rank are variety and forma, and more ranks can be made by using the prefix &quot;sub&quot; to make subspecies, subvariety, subforma. Very rarely even more forms are created, such as supersubspecies. Not all of these ranks need to be specified, for example, some authors prefer to divide plant species into subspecies, while others prefer to use varieties.

These ranks are components of a biological classification, for example &quot;Corylopsis sinensis&quot; var. &quot;calvescens&quot; f. &quot;veitchiana&quot; is an ornamental garden plant. However, a name is not the same as a classification, and the name of this plant is a trinomial with only three parts, the two parts of the species name &quot;Corylopsis sinensis&quot;, plus the forma epithet &quot;veitchiana&quot;, to give &quot;Corylopsis sinensis&quot; f. &quot;veitchiana&quot;.

<doc id="392975" wikidata="Q250246" url="?curid=392975" title="Presidents' Trophy">
<text>The Presidents&#x27; Trophy () is an award presented by the National Hockey League (NHL) to the team that finishes with the most points (i.e., best overall record) during the regular season. If two teams are tied for the most points, then the Trophy goes to the team with the most regulation wins (RW). The Presidents&#x27; Trophy has been awarded 37 times to 18 different teams since its inception during the 1985–86 NHL season.

As the team with the best regular season record, the Presidents&#x27; Trophy winner is normally guaranteed home-ice advantage throughout the entire Stanley Cup playoffs. However, winning the award does not assure playoff success, as there have been only eight instances where the Presidents&#x27; Trophy winner has gone on to win the Stanley Cup in the same season, while three Presidents&#x27; Trophy winners have been defeated in the Stanley Cup Finals. The most recent team to win both the Presidents&#x27; Trophy and the Stanley Cup in the same season is the 2012–13 Chicago Blackhawks. The only team to accomplish this feat more than once is the Detroit Red Wings.

==History==
The Trophy was introduced at the start of the by the League&#x27;s Board of Governors to recognize the best team in the regular season, informally known as the regular season championship. Prior to this, the team that finished in first place when the regular season concluded was allowed to hang a banner reading &quot;NHL League Champions.&quot;

A total of 18 teams have won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy. The Detroit Red Wings have won six Presidents&#x27; Trophies, the most of any team. The Boston Bruins and New York Rangers are tied for second with four. The Colorado Avalanche and Washington Capitals are tied for third with three. Five teams (Calgary Flames, Chicago Blackhawks, Dallas Stars, Edmonton Oilers, Vancouver Canucks) are tied for fourth most with two Presidents&#x27; Trophy wins apiece. Among these multiple winners, Calgary, Dallas, Detroit, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Washington have won it in consecutive seasons. Out of these teams, Edmonton, Calgary, and Dallas have captured a Stanley Cup along with their second straight Presidents&#x27; Trophy.

If there are two or more teams tied for first in points in the League, then the NHL&#x27;s standard tiebreaking procedure is applied, with the first tiebreaker being the team with the most regulation wins (that is, all games won except those won in overtime or in a shootout). During the shortened , both the Colorado Avalanche and Vegas Golden Knights finished tied for first with 82 points in 56 games, with Colorado winning the trophy since they had 35 regulation wins while Vegas had 30. From the through seasons, the first tiebreaker was most regulation and overtime wins. Before 2010, the first tiebreaker was the most wins including both overtime and shootout wins. The most notable of the pre-2010–11 protocol is from the , where both the Buffalo Sabres and Detroit Red Wings finished tied first with 113 points, with the Sabres winning the Trophy since they had 53 wins, three more than Detroit, who had 50.

===Past trophies===
From 1937 to 1967, the same criterion now observed for winning the Presidents&#x27; Trophy was used to award the Prince of Wales Trophy. With the modern era expansion in the and the creation of the West Division, the Wales Trophy was awarded to the team that finished in first place in the East Division during the regular season. However, no trophy was awarded to the team that finished with the best overall record in the entire League during this period, and no trophy at all was awarded based on the results of the regular season from the through seasons. A cash bonus of $350,000 was awarded to the winning team with the NHL&#x27;s best regular season record during these years, to which the Presidents&#x27; Trophy was added in . The cash bonus is split amongst the players on the active roster of the winning team.

Factoring all NHL seasons prior to the introduction of the Presidents&#x27; Trophy, the Montreal Canadiens have finished first overall 21 times, the most times in League history (although this was most recently accomplished in , before the Trophy was introduced; since its inception, the Canadiens have been Presidents&#x27; runners-up three times, in , , and ). Detroit is second with 18 first-overall finishes.

==Playoff implications==
The Presidents&#x27; Trophy winner is normally guaranteed home-ice advantage throughout the Stanley Cup playoffs. This does not necessarily correlate to success in the playoffs, however. The Trophy has been awarded 36 times, but only eight of the winners have gone on to win the Stanley Cup in their respective years, leading to a popular superstition that the Trophy may be cursed. In addition, eight Presidents&#x27; Trophy winners have been eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, with first-round upsets being common in the NHL compared to other major professional sports. Since the salary cap era of the NHL from 2005–06 onwards the first-placed NHL team has had the lowest probability of winning the playoff championship, compared to the other three North American major professional sports leagues (NBA, MLB, and NFL).

NHL broadcaster Darren Eliot attributes the apparent lack of playoff success to the different style of competition compared to the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, the goal is to advance through four best-of-seven playoff series. The Presidents&#x27; Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team or other players that pose match-up problems. If the regular season champion&#x27;s primary success was merely outscoring others, they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out. The lack of playoff experience may have been to blame in the examples of the 1999–2000 St. Louis Blues and 2008–09 San Jose Sharks, as neither team had advanced past the second round for five or more seasons. Teams have often given up pursuit of finishing first in the League in order to avoid injuries and rest key players for the postseason.

Ian Cooper, writing for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, noted that &quot;of 11 Presidents&#x27; Trophy winners to lose in the first two rounds, seven came from divisions that were among the league&#x27;s weaker half ... If a team dominates a weak division, its shortcomings should become apparent once it faces stiffer competition from the rest of the conference&quot;. Jonathan Weiss, writing for the Bleacher Report in 2010, also noted that of the teams between 1982 and 2009 that led the League in points during the regular season, 12 of them (45 per cent) reached the Cup Finals, while of the other 405 teams during that same time period, only 42 (10 per cent) advanced to the final round, concluding that &quot;the team that leads the NHL in regular season points is four to five times more likely than any other team in the playoffs to make it into the Stanley Cup finals, and seven to eight times more likely to win the Cup&quot;.

The 1995–96 Red Wings were considered a &quot;cursed&quot; team, as their record-setting season was cut short by the newly relocated Colorado Avalanche in the Conference Finals, sparking a particularly vicious rivalry between the two teams in subsequent seasons. In the 1996–97 season, the Avalanche were the defending Cup champions and won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy but lost the Conference Finals which was a rematch against the Red Wings, the Red Wings went on to win the Cup. The Red Wings would go onto the defeat the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Dallas Stars in 1998, en route to the Red Wings&#x27; second straight Cup win. Thereafter, in three of four seasons, the Presidents&#x27; Trophy winning team went on to win the Stanley Cup (Stars in 1999, Avalanche in 2001, and Red Wings in 2002).

Since the Blackhawks won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy and Stanley Cup in the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, the &quot;curse&quot; has been more pronounced. The 2018–19 Tampa Bay Lightning were swept in the first round by the Wild Card Columbus Blue Jackets after a dominant season in which they tied the 1995–96 Detroit Red Wings&#x27; record for regular season wins, becoming the first Presidents&#x27; Trophy winner to suffer this fate. Adding to the ignominy was the Blue Jackets&#x27; previous lack of postseason success, as their sweep of the Lightning was their first playoff series victory in franchise history, with only four previous playoff qualifications. By contrast, the Lightning had made several deep playoff runs in the previous seasons (including a Cup Finals appearance in 2015). Over the next three years, the Lightning did not win the Presidents&#x27; Trophy but nevertheless won two consecutive Stanley Cups while reaching a third consecutive Stanley Cup Finals. For the 2022–23 Boston Bruins; after setting new records for single-season wins and points, they proceeded to lose in the first round in seven games to the Florida Panthers after having led the series three games to one. The Panthers were incidentally the previous season&#x27;s Presidents&#x27; Trophy winners, where their 2021–22 season ended when they were swept in the second round by the Lightning (en route to the Lightning&#x27;s third consecutive Finals appearance).

Only three times in the history of the Presidents&#x27; Trophy has a team missed the playoffs the season after winning the award: the New York Rangers, who won the Trophy in the season and missed the playoffs in (and then rebounded to win both the Presidents&#x27; Trophy and Stanley Cup in ); the Buffalo Sabres, who won the Trophy in the season and missed the playoffs in ; and the Boston Bruins, who won the Trophy in the season and missed the playoffs in despite having a winning record.

===NHL vs. PCHA/WCHL/WHL Stanley Cup era (1917–1926)===
Prior to 1926–27, the Stanley Cup was then awarded as a &quot;World Series&quot; trophy between the champions of the NHL and a rival league (first the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, then the Western Canada Hockey League). Instead, the NHL championship trophy during this era was the O&#x27;Brien Trophy.

From 1917–18 to , the NHL season was split, requiring separate standings, with a single playoff series between the winner of the first half of the season and the winner of the second half of the season.


===NHL takes control of the Stanley Cup (since 1927)===
After the 1925–26 season, the NHL became the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup. The Stanley Cup thus became the &quot;de facto&quot; NHL championship trophy, though the league did not take formal control of the trophy until 1947.
The Prince of Wales Trophy was awarded from to for the entire league regular season.

<doc id="392979" wikidata="Q189117" url="?curid=392979" title="Jan Matejko">
<text>Jan Alojzy Matejko (; also known as Jan Mateyko; 24 June 1838 – 1 November 1893) was a Polish painter, a leading 19th-century exponent of history painting, known for depicting nodal events from Polish history. His works include large scale oil paintings such as &quot;Stańczyk&quot; (1862), &quot;Rejtan&quot; (1866), &quot;Union of Lublin&quot; (1869),&quot; Astronomer Copernicus, or Conversations with God&quot; (1873), or &quot;Battle of Grunwald&quot; (1878). He was the author of numerous portraits, a gallery of Polish monarchs in book form, and murals in St. Mary&#x27;s Basilica, Kraków. He is considered by many as the most celebrated Polish painter, and sometimes as the &quot;national painter&quot; of Poland. 

Matejko spent most of his life in Kraków. He enrolled at the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts at age fourteen, where he studied under notable artists such as Wojciech Korneli Stattler and Władysław Łuszczkiewicz and completed his first major historical painting in 1853. His early exposure to revolutions in Kraków and the military service of his brothers influenced his artistic themes. After studying art in Munich and Vienna, he returned to Kraków and set up a studio. He gradually gained recognition, selling key paintings that settled his debts and created some of his most famous works, including &quot;Stańczyk&quot; and &quot;Skarga&#x27;s Sermon&quot;. Matejko&#x27;s art played a key role in promoting Polish history and national identity at a time when Poland was partitioned and lacked political autonomy.

At the same time, Matejko&#x27;s painting style has been criticised as old-fashioned and overly theatrical, labeled as &quot;antiquarian realism&quot;. His works often lost their nuanced historical significance when displayed abroad due to the audience&#x27;s unfamiliarity with Polish history. Matejko&#x27;s support for the Polish cause was not just through his art; he also contributed financially and materially to the January Uprising of 1863. Later, he became director of the art academy in Kraków, which was eventually renamed the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts. A number of his students became prominent artists in their own right, including Maurycy Gottlieb, Jacek Malczewski, Józef Mehoffer and Stanisław Wyspiański. He received several honors during his lifetime, including the French Légion d&#x27;honneur. Matejko was among the notable people to receive an unsolicited letter from the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, as the latter tipped, in January 1889, into his psychotic breakdown while in Turin.

==Biography==
===Youth===
Matejko was born on 24 June 1838, in the Free City of Kraków. His father, Franciszek Ksawery Matejko () (born 1789 or 13 January 1793, died 26 October 1860), a Czech from the village of Roudnice, was a graduate of the Hradec Králové school who later became a tutor and music teacher. He first worked for the Wodzicki family in Kościelniki, Poland, then moved to Kraków, where he married the half-German, half-Polish Joanna Karolina Rossberg (Rozberg). Jan was the ninth of eleven children. His mother died when he was very young and his older brother, Franciszek had a hand in the manner of his upbringing. He grew up in a kamienica building on Floriańska Street. After the death of his mother in 1845, Jan and his siblings were cared for by his maternal aunt, Anna Zamojska.

At a young age he witnessed the Kraków revolution of 1846 and the 1848 siege of Kraków by the Austrians, two events which put an end to the Free City of Kraków. Two of his older brothers served in both armed conflicts, under General Józef Bem. One of them, Edmund, fell in battle and the other was forced into exile. Matejko attended St. Anne&#x27;s High School, but he dropped out in 1851 because of poor grades. Matejko showed an early artistic talent, but had great difficulty with other academic subjects. He never fully mastered a foreign language. Despite that, and because of his exceptional skill, at the age of fourteen he entered the School of Fine Arts in Kraków, where he was a contemporary of Artur Grottger from 1852 to 1858. His teachers included Wojciech Korneli Stattler and Władysław Łuszczkiewicz. He opted for historical painting as his specialism, and finished his first major work, &quot;The Shuyski Tsars before Zygmunt III&quot; (&quot;Carowie Szujscy przed Zygmuntem III&quot;), in 1853 (he would return to this theme a year before his death, in 1892. During this time, he began exhibiting historical paintings at the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts from 1855. His graduation project in 1858 was &quot;Sigismund I the Old ennobles professors of the Jagiellonian University&quot; (&quot;Zygmunt I nadaje szlachectwo profesorom Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego&quot;) and proved to be seminal.

After graduation in 1859, Matejko received a scholarship to study with Hermann Anschütz at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. The following year he received a further scholarship to study at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, but after only a few days and a major quarrel with Christian Ruben, Matejko returned to Kraków. He set up a studio at his family home in Floriańska Street. It took years before he met with commercial success. He struggled as the proverbial &quot;starving artist&quot;, who finally celebrated when he managed to sell the &quot;Shuyski Tsars...&quot; canvas for five florins.

In 1860, against a background of cultural erosion in partitioned Poland Matejko published an illustrated album, &quot;Clothing in Poland&quot; (&quot;Ubiory w Polsce&quot;), a project reflecting his intense interest in the historical record of his nation and his desire to promote it among Polish people and incidentally stir their patriotism. His financial situation improved when he sold two paintings, &quot;The assassination of Wapowski during the coronation of Henri de Valois&quot; (&quot;Zabicie Wapowskiego w czasie koronacji Henryka Walezego&quot;, 1861) and &quot;Jan Kochanowski over the body of his daughter Urszulka&quot; (&quot;Jan Kochanowski nad zwłokami Urszulki&quot;, 1862), which settled his debts.
1862 saw the completion of his &quot;Stańczyk&quot;, initially received without much acclaim, but in due course becoming one of Matejko&#x27;s best known works. It marks a manifest departure in Matejko&#x27;s art, from mere illustrator of history to commentator upon its moral content.
During the January Uprising of 1863, in which he did not directly take part on account of his poor health, Matejko supported it financially, donating most of his savings to the cause, and personally transporting arms to an insurgents&#x27; camp. Subsequently, his &quot;Skarga&#x27;s Sermon&quot; (&quot;Kazanie Skargi&quot;), May 1864, was exhibited in the gallery of the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts, which gained him much publicity. On 5 November that same year, he was elected member of the &quot;Kraków Scientific Society&quot; (&quot;Towarzystwo Naukowe Krakowskie&quot;) in recognition for his contributions to depicting great national historical themes. On 21 November he married Teodora Giebułtowska, with whom he went on to have five children: Beata, Helena, Tadeusz, Jerzy and Regina. His daughter, Helena, also an artist, later helped World War I victims and was awarded the Cross of Independence by President Stanisław Wojciechowski.

===Rise to fame===

After 1865 Matejko&#x27;s international recognition grew. His &quot;Skarga&#x27;s Sermon&quot; was awarded a gold medal at the 1865 Paris Salon, prompting Count to buy it for 10,000 florins. In 1867, his painting &quot;Rejtan&quot; was awarded a gold medal at the World Exhibition in Paris and was acquired by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria for 50,000 franks. His next major painting was the &quot;Union of Lublin&quot; (&quot;Unia Lubelska&quot;), created during 1867–1869. Acclaimed in Paris, it won Matejko the Cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. and was purchased by the Sejm of Galicia. It was followed by &quot;Stefan Batory at Pskov&quot; (&quot;Stefan Batory pod Pskowem&quot;), finished in 1871. In 1872, he visited Istanbul and upon his return to Kraków finished &quot;The Astronomer Copernicus, or Conversations with God&quot; (&quot;Astronom Kopernik, czyli rozmowa z Bogiem&quot;), which was acquired by the Jagiellonian University. From the 1870s onwards he was aided by a secretary, Marian Gorzkowski, who became his personal assistant, his closest friend, a model for a number of his paintings, and the author of a memoir about Matejko.

In 1872, during an exhibition in Prague he was offered the directorship of the Prague Academy of Fine Arts, quickly followed by a similar offer from the Kraków School of Fine Arts. He accepted the Kraków position, and was for many years its principal (rector). In 1874, he finished &quot;Zawieszenie dzwonu Zygmunta&quot; (&quot;The Hanging of the Sigismund bell&quot;). In 1878, he produced another masterpiece, &quot;The Battle of Grunwald&quot;. That year he received an &quot;honorary grand gold&quot; medal in Paris, while Kraków city council presented him with a ceremonial scepter, as a symbol of his &quot;royal status in fine art&quot;. In 1879 came his &quot;Rok 1863 - Polonia&quot; (&quot;The Year 1863 - Polonia&quot;), his depiction of the January Uprising. Begun in 1864 as the Uprising was waning, he abandoned the canvas for a number of years, perhaps due to the loss of several close friends and family members in the conflict. It languished unfinished until prince Władysław Czartoryski became interested in acquiring it. To this day it is considered unfinished.

1880-1882 were taken up with another large work, &quot;The Prussian Tribute&quot; (&quot;Hołd Pruski&quot;) which Matejko gifted to &quot;the Polish nation&quot;. It earned him the honorary citizenship of Kraków. One of the city&#x27;s squares was renamed Matejko Square. In 1883 he finished &quot;Jan Sobieski at Vienna&quot; (&quot;Jan Sobieski pod Wiedniem&quot;) which came to be presented to Pope Leo XIII as a &quot;gift of the Polish nation&quot;. Being a member of the delegation delivering the canvas to Rome, Matejko was awarded the Knight Commander with Star of the Order of Pius IX. The painting is on permanent exhibition in the &quot;Sobieski Room&quot; at the Vatican Museums. Around that time he also became vocal on a number of political issues, publishing letters on topics such as Polish-Russian relations. He was also very engaged in efforts to protect and reconstruct historical monuments in Kraków. In 1886, he finished a painting relating to French rather than Polish history, &quot;The Virgin of Orléans&quot;, a portrayal of Joan of Arc.

In 1887 Matejko received an honorary doctorate from the Jagiellonian University, and recognition from the Austrian Society, &quot;Litteris et Artibus&quot;. In 1888 he completed &quot;The Battle of Racławice&quot; (&quot;Bitwa pod Racławicami&quot;). In 1888-1899, to justify his new academic title, he published a group of twelve drawings with accompanying commentary, &quot; The History of civilisation in Poland&quot; (&quot;Dzieje Cywilizacji w Polsce&quot;). Between 1890 and 1892, he published a series of works on paper, portraying all the monarchs of Poland (&quot;Poczet królów i książąt polskich&quot; - &quot;The kings and princes of Poland&quot;, including queens), whose popularity turned them into the canon portrayals of their subjects. 1891 marked his &quot;Constitution of the 3 May&quot; (&quot;Konstytucja 3 Maja&quot;). He went on to compose another large scale work, &quot;The Oaths of Jan Kazimierz&quot; (&quot;Śluby Jana Kazimierza&quot;), but death intervened. In 1892, a year before his death, he completed his &quot;Self-portrait&quot; (&quot;Autoportret&quot;).

===Portraits and other work===
In addition to the history paintings Matejko was a prolific portraitist. His subjects included Jagiellonian University rectors Józef Szujski and Stanisław Tarnowski, and numerous portraits of family and friends, including &quot;Wife in her wedding dress&quot; (&quot;Żona w sukni ślubnej&quot;) (1865, destroyed by his wife during a quarrel and recreated in 1879) and a self-portrait (1892). Altogether Matejko authored 320 oil paintings and several thousand drawings and watercolours. He also designed the monumental polychrome murals for the Brick Gothic St. Mary&#x27;s Basilica, Kraków (1889–1891), which in 1978 became a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside the Historic Centre of Kraków.

===Death===

Matejko suffered from a peptic ulcer, and died in Kraków on 1 November of internal bleeding. His funeral on 5 November drew large crowds, and his death was newsworthy in at least thirty two European newspapers. He was buried in Kraków&#x27;s Rakowicki Cemetery.

==Significance, style and themes==
He is counted among the most significant of Polish painters, and considered by many as &quot;Poland&#x27;s greatest history painter&quot; or as &quot;a cult figure for the nation at large... [already] by the time of his death.&quot;. Wilhelm von Kaulbach and his &quot;historical symbolism&quot; style had a profound influence on Matejko. This aimed not so much at an exact representation of past events, but gave the artist freedom to interpret and opened the possibility to blend historical data within a chosen perspective. Matejko&#x27;s technique in the Neoclassical genre has been praised for its &quot;luminosity, detail and imagination&quot;.

He succeeded in propagating Polish history, and fostering the memory of an erstwhile historic state lost to the world, while his country remained carved up between three European powers which afforded its Polish natives no prospect of political self-determination. His works, disseminated through thousands of reproductions, have become standard illustrations of the many key events in Polish history. His 1860 illustrated album, &quot;Ubiory w Polsce&quot; (Costume in Poland), is seen as a valuable historical reference.

===Criticism and controversy===
Critics of his work have pointed to his use of traditional, outdated or bombastic painting style, discrediting him for &quot;antiquarian realism&quot; and &quot;theatrical effects&quot;. At exhibitions abroad, the nuanced historical context of his works was often lost on foreign audiences. Occasionally his paintings would cause controversy. For example, &quot;Rejtan&quot; offended a number of prominent members of the Polish nobility, who saw the painting as an indictment of their entire social class. His paintings were subject to censorship in the Russian Empire. Nazi Germany planned to destroy both &quot;The Battle of Grunwald&quot; and &quot;The Prussian Homage&quot;, which the authorities saw as an offence against the German view of history. They formed part of the very many Polish paintings and art which the Germans planned to destroy in their war on Polish culture, but the Polish resistance successfully hid both.

==Legacy==
Matejko&#x27;s aim was to focus on major themes in Polish history using historical sources to paint events in minute historical detail. His earliest paintings are purely historical depictions without didactic content. The later works, starting with &quot;Stańczyk&quot; (1862), are intended to inspire the viewer with a patriotic message. &quot;Stańczyk&quot; focuses on the court jester, portrayed as a symbol of his country&#x27;s conscience, sitting in a chair, against the background of a party - a lonely figure reflecting on war, ignored by the joyful crowd.

His paintings are on display in numerous Polish museums, including: the National Museum in Warsaw, National Museum in Kraków, National Museum in Poznań and National Museum in Wrocław. The National Museum, Kraków has a building entirely dedicated to Matejko - &quot;The Jan Matejko House&quot; (&quot;Dom Jana Matejki&quot;), occupying his former studio and family home in Floriańska Street and opened in 1898. Another museum dedicated to Matejko, is the &quot;Jan Matejko Manor House&quot; (Dworek Jana Matejki w Krzesławicach), in the village of Krzesławice, where Matejko had bought a small estate in 1865.

===As teacher and influencer===
Over 80 painters were Matejko&#x27;s students, many influenced during his tenure as director of the &quot;Kraków School of Fine Arts&quot;, and are called members of the &quot;Matejko School&quot;. Some went on to become members of the brief flowering of the Young Poland (&quot;Młoda Polska&quot;) movement, which encompassed literature, music, theatre as well as visual arts and was dissipated by World War I. Matejko has been dubbed &quot;Father of Young Poland&quot;. Prominent among his students were:

*Maurycy Gottlieb 
*Ephraim Moses Lilien
* Jacek Malczewski
* Helena Matejko, Matejko&#x27;s daughter 
* Józef Mehoffer
* Jozef Pankiewicz 
* Antoni Piotrowski 
* Witold Pruszkowski
* Jan Styka
* Włodzimierz Tetmajer
* Józef Unierzyski, Matejko&#x27;s son-in-law
* Leon Wyczółkowski 
* Stanisław Wyspiański

<doc id="392980" wikidata="Q1048864" url="?curid=392980" title="Tōtōmi Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of Japan that is today western Shizuoka Prefecture. Tōtōmi bordered on Mikawa, Suruga and Shinano Provinces. Its abbreviated form name was . The origin of its name is the old name of Lake Hamana.

==History==
Tōtōmi was one of the original provinces of Japan established in the Nara period under the Taihō Code. The original capital of the province was located in what is now Iwata, and was named Mitsuke – a name which survived into modern times as Mitsuke-juku, a post station on the Tōkaidō. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Tōtōmi was ranked as a &quot;superior country&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the 16 &quot;middle countries&quot; (中国) in terms of distance from the capital.

During the early Muromachi period, Tōtōmi was ruled nominally by the Imagawa clan before coming under control of the Shiba clan. However, by the Sengoku period, the Imagawa recovered Tōtōmi and effectively annexed it to Suruga Province. After the defeat of the Imagawa at the Battle of Okehazama, Tōtōmi was divided between the powerful warlords Takeda Shingen of Kai and Tokugawa Ieyasu of Mikawa. To consolidate his new holdings, Tokugawa Ieyasu constructed Hamamatsu Castle, which effectively became the capital of the province, although parts of Tōtōmi continued to be contested between the Tokugawa and Takeda until Shingen&#x27;s death.

After the Battle of Odawara and the rise to power of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu was forced to trade his domains in the Tōkai region for the Kantō region instead. Hamamatsu was relinquished to the Horii clan and subsidiary Kakegawa Castle to Yamauchi Kazutoyo. After the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, the Tokugawa recovered their lost territories, and reassigned Tōtōmi to various &quot;fudai daimyōs&quot;.

During the Edo period, the Tōkaidō road from Edo to Kyoto passed through Tōtōmi, with post stations at several locations. For defensive purposes, the Tokugawa shogunate forbid the construction of bridges on the major rivers (such as at the Tenryū River), which further led to town development on the major river crossings.

At the end of the Tokugawa shogunate, Tōtōmi Province was divided among several feudal domains, which were assigned to close &quot;fudai&quot; retainers. Following the defeat of the Tokugawa shogunate during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, the last Tokugawa shōgun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu returned to Suruga in 1868 to rule the short-lived Shizuoka Domain, and the existing &quot;daimyōs&quot; in Tōtōmi were reassigned to other territories, mostly in Kazusa Province

After the abolition of the han system in 1871 by the new Meiji government, during the first wave of prefectural mergers (第1次府県統合 &quot;daiichiji fu/ken tōgō&quot;), the new prefectures in Tōtōmi were merged into Hamamatsu Prefecture, with enclaves of other prefectures/exclaves in other provinces being removed, so that Hamamatsu and Tōtōmi became basically contiguous. On August 21, 1876, Hamamatsu was merged into Shizuoka Prefecture, which by that time comprised all of Suruga and Izu provinces, to form an enlarged Shizuoka Prefecture; it reached practically its present-day extent in 1878 when a part of Izu Province, namely the Izu Islands, were transferred from Shizuoka to Tokyo.

Many former samurai of the feudal domains in Tōtōmi, now unemployed due to the sudden end to feudalism, were settled in the Makinohara region, where they developed the green tea industry. With the coming of the Tōkaidō Main Line railway, Hamamatsu developed rapidly into a major commercial and industrial center, especially in connection with the cotton and silk-spinning industries.

==Districts under the Ritsuryō system==
Tōtōmi Province consisted of twelve districts:

* In modern times part of: Hamamatsu, Horie (a fiefdom established only in the restoration) and many other feudal domains/shogunate/crown lands/prefectures 1868 → completely Hamamatsu Prefecture 1871/72 → Shizuoka Prefecture since 1876
** Aratama District (麁玉郡) – merged into Inasa District on April 1, 1896
** Fuchi District (敷知郡) – merged into Hamana District (along with Nakagami District) on April 1, 1896
** Haibara District (榛原郡)
** Hamana District (浜名郡) – absorbed Fuchi and Nakagami Districts on April 1, 1896; now dissolved
** Inasa District (引佐郡) – absorbed Aratama District on April 1, 1896; now dissolved
** Iwata District (磐田郡) – absorbed Toyoda and Yamana Districts on April 1, 1896; now dissolved
** Kitō District (城東郡) – merged with Saya District to become Ogasa District (小笠郡) on April 1, 1896
** Nagakami District (長上郡) – merged into Hamana District (along with Fuchi District) on April 1, 1896
** Saya District (佐野郡) – merged with Kitō District to become Ogasa District on April 1, 1896
** Shūchi District (周智郡)
** Toyoda District (豊田郡) – merged into Iwata District (along with Yamana District) on April 1, 1896
** Yamana District (山名郡) – merged into Iwata District (along with Toyoda District) on April 1, 1896

==Bakumatsu-period feudal division==
Generally, the &quot;kokudaka&quot; nominal income did not correspond to the actual income from a given village/district/province, and in addition there were some, especially non-agricultural, sources of taxable or direct income that were not always accurately represented in the baku/han kokudaka system of the Edo period.

Note: The &quot;kokudaka&quot; given in the table is the total from within &amp; without the province, not restricted to the parts of the domain actually located in Tōtōmi.

<text>Philippe Manoury (born 19 June 1952) is a French composer.

==Biography==
Manoury was born in Tulle and began composition studies at the Ecole Normale de Musique de Paris with Gérard Condé and Max Deutsch. He continued his studies from 1974 to 1978 at the Conservatoire de Paris with Michel Philippot, Ivo Malec, and Claude Ballif. In 1975, he undertook studies in computer assisted composition with , and joined IRCAM as a composer and electronic music researcher in 1980. From 2004 until 2012, Manoury served on the composition faculty at the University of California, San Diego, where he taught composition, electronic music, and analysis in the graduate program. After retiring from teaching at UCSD, he currently lives in Strasbourg, France.

==Music==
Manoury&#x27;s work is strongly influenced by Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Iannis Xenakis, and his early work from 1972 to 1976 combines serial punctualism with the densely massed elements characteristic of the music of Stockhausen and Xenakis, and the paintings of Jackson Pollock. Works such as &quot;Sound and Fury&quot; are of interest because of the use of computer-assisted composition. &quot;Sound and Fury&quot; also uses a very large orchestra, which is symmetrically disposed, and makes quite extensive use of left-right spatial effects.

Since the 1980s, Manoury has been closely associated with the American computer researcher Miller Puckette, first at IRCAM and subsequently at UCSD. The &quot;Sonus ex machina&quot; series of works (&quot;Jupiter&quot;, &quot;Pluton&quot;, &quot;Neptune&quot; and &quot;La Partition du Ciel et de l&#x27;Enfer&quot;), which were developed in collaboration with Puckette, are among the first pieces to utilize real-time audio signal processing, and &quot;Pluton&quot; was the first ever composition using Puckette&#x27;s groundbreaking software Max.

His &quot;Abgrund—pour grand orchestre&quot; was commissioned by the Bavarian State Opera together with the Orchestre symphonique de Montréal and premiered by the Bavarian State Orchestra on November 26, 2007. It has been described as &quot;a work that will neither disturb nor annoy [...] a pleasant and perhaps harmless string of dissonant semi-climaxes, little jolts, and resting phases. It has an invigorating effect, is easy to concentrate on . . .&quot;. In it &quot;Manoury [...] mercifully knows how to use [the abundance of percussion instruments] in ways far more discriminately than his contemporaries beholden to one bongo-frenzy after another&quot;. &quot;Philippe Manoury hit[s] the right mix between shallow and deep, melodic and dissonant, placating and strident, stasis and progress, simplicity and complexity. The steady run-up—stop—tighten—burst—relax scheme may not be novel at all, but it paid dividends [in &#x27;Abgrund&#x27;]&quot;.

<doc id="392987" wikidata="Q860928" url="?curid=392987" title="Izu Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area now part of Shizuoka Prefecture and Tokyo. Izu bordered on Sagami and Suruga Provinces. Its abbreviated form name was . 

The mainland portion of Izu Province, comprising the Izu Peninsula, is today the eastern portion of Shizuoka Prefecture and the Izu Islands are now part of Tokyo.

==History==
In 680 A.D., two districts of Suruga Province, Tagata District and Kamo District, were separated into the new Izu Province. At some point between the year 701 and 710, Naka District was added. The capital of the new province was established at Mishima, which also had the &quot;Kokubun-ji&quot; and the Ichinomiya (Mishima Taisha) of the province. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Izu was ranked as a &quot;lesser country&quot; (下国). Under the &quot;ritsuryō&quot; legal system, Izu was one of the preferred locations for exile for those convicted of political crimes by the Heian period court.

In the Kamakura period, Izu was ruled by the Hōjō clan. During the Muromachi period, Izu was ruled nominally by the Uesugi clan due to their position as Kantō Kanrei; however, in reality, Izu came under the domination of whoever ruled the Kantō provinces of Sagami and Musashi. By the Sengoku period, this was the Later Hōjō clan based in Odawara. After the Battle of Odawara, Toyotomi Hideyoshi changed the fief of Tokugawa Ieyasu from his domains in the Tōkai region for the Kantō region instead, and Izu was one of the provinces that came under Tokugawa rule. After the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, Izu remained as a &quot;tenryō&quot; territory administered directly by the Shōgun. Much of the province was ruled by a &quot;daikan&quot; established in Nirayama, although portions were assigned to various &quot;hatamoto&quot; and to Odawara Domain. During the Edo period, Kimisawa District was added to the three ancient districts of Izu.

During the Edo period, the Tōkaidō road from Edo to Kyoto passed through northern Izu, with a post station at Mishima-shuku. The port of Shimoda at the southern end of Izu was a required port-of-call for all vessels approaching Edo from the east.

During the Bakumatsu period, Shimoda was chosen by the Tokugawa government as a port to be opened to American trade under the conditions of the Convention of Kanagawa, negotiated by Commodore Matthew Perry and signed on March 31, 1854. Shimoda was also the site of Yoshida Shōin&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to board Perry&#x27;s &quot;Black Ships&quot; in 1854. The first American Consulate in Japan was opened at the temple of Gyokusen-ji in Shimoda under Consul General Townsend Harris. Harris negotiated the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the two countries, which was signed at nearby Ryōsen-ji in 1858. Japan&#x27;s relations with Imperial Russia were also negotiated in Shimoda, and in 1855 the Treaty of Shimoda was signed at Chōraku-ji.

After the start of the Meiji period, the districts of Naka and Kimisawa were merged with Kamo District, and Izu Province was merged into the short-lived Ashigaru Prefecture in 1871.
Ashigaru Prefecture was divided between Shizuoka Prefecture and Kanagawa Prefecture on April 18, 1876, and the Izu Islands were subsequently transferred from Shizuoka Prefecture to Tokyo in 1878.

==Historical districts==
Izu Province consisted of four districts:

* Shizuoka Prefecture
** Kamo District () – absorbed Naka District to become an expanded Kamo District; but lost parts to former Tagata District to become an expanded Tagata District on April 1, 1896
** Kimisawa District () – merged with Naka and parts of original Kamo Districts into former Tagata District to become an expanded Tagata District on April 1, 1896
** Naka District () – merged into remaining parts of original Kamo District to become an expanded Kamo District on April 1, 1896
** Tagata District () – absorbed Kimisawa, Naka and parts of Kamo Districts into former Tagata District to become an expanded Tagata District on April 1, 1896

<doc id="392994" wikidata="Q516845" url="?curid=392994" title="Pascal Dusapin">
<text>Pascal Georges Dusapin (born 29 May 1955) is a French composer. His music is marked by its microtonality, tension, and energy.

A pupil of Iannis Xenakis and Franco Donatoni and an admirer of Varèse, Dusapin studied at the University of Paris I and Paris VIII during the 1970s. His music is full of &quot;romantic constraint&quot;. Despite being a pianist, he refused to compose for the piano until 1997. His melodies have a vocal quality, even in purely instrumental works.

Dusapin has composed solo, chamber, orchestral, vocal, and choral works, as well as several operas, and has been honored with numerous prizes and awards.

==Education and influences==
Dusapin, born in Nancy, studied musicology, plastic arts, and art sciences at the University of Paris I and Paris VIII in the early 1970s. He felt a certain &quot;shock&quot; upon hearing Edgard Varèse&#x27;s &quot;Arcana&quot; (1927), and a similar shock when he attended Iannis Xenakis&#x27;s multimedia performance &quot;Polytope de Cluny&quot; in 1972, yet he felt &quot;une proximité plus grande&quot; (&quot;a greater closeness&quot;) to the latter composer. Because of his attraction to Xenakis&#x27;s music, Dusapin studied with the composer at the Sorbonne in Paris, where he remained a student from 1974 to 1978. His classes with Xenakis included such subjects as aesthetics and science. Dusapin also studied with Italian composer Franco Donatoni, who was invited to the University of Vincennes (Paris VIII) in 1976.

While Dusapin&#x27;s studies with these composers formed a foundation for his compositional studies—particularly for his understanding of sound masses—he developed his own musical language. According to I. Stoïnova, &quot;Though attached to ... Varèse, Xenakis, Donatoni, Dusapin is nevertheless completely solitary because he is not only aware of his legacy, but also of the distance which separates him from his mentors: a creative distance of an aesthetic order and sensibility, a way of existing in sounds&quot;. He absorbed styles and ideas from these composers, then transformed them to fit his own musical needs.

Besides being influenced by composers such as Varèse and Xenakis who dealt with sound masses, Dusapin&#x27;s music also shows the influence of other musical traditions, including jazz. In fact, he was once a jazz pianist, though up until 1997 he refused to include piano in his compositions. Beginning in the late 1980s with his piece &quot;Aks&quot; (1987) and continuing into the 1990s, Dusapin incorporated French folk music into his musical language. In &quot;Aks&quot;, commissioned by the Société des Amis du Musé des Arts et Traditions Populaires, Dusapin immediately quotes a folk-melody, but the rest of the piece is composed independently from the folk song. Dusapin&#x27;s work from the 1990s further illustrates the influence of folk music through its frequent use of drones and use of restricted modes, though most often without obvious tonal centers. Other sources of inspiration include graphic arts and poetry.

==Musical style==

===Instrumentation===
One way in which Dusapin stands out from other contemporary composers is through his selection of certain instruments and rejection of others. Unlike even Xenakis, he avoids the use of electronics and technology in his music. Likewise, he has removed the use of percussion other than timpani from his works. Until recently, Dusapin also rejected the use of keyboard instruments, despite the fact that he plays the organ and jazz piano. As a possible reason for Dusapin&#x27;s rejection of these instruments, Stoïnova suggests, &quot;The scale and static timbre of the piano, as well as the noisy, uniform textures of percussion are incorporated with difficulty by Dusapin into his microtonal perspective which seems to define the very essence of his dynamic melodism.&quot; Stoïnova, however, wrote this article four years before Dusapin completed the &quot;Trio Rombach&quot; (1997), for piano, violin or clarinet, and cello. This piano trio was the first work in which Dusapin incorporated piano, and not until 2001 did he complete a piece for solo piano, &quot;Sept Études&quot; (1999–2001).

===Microtonality===
Dusapin&#x27;s music is also marked by its microtonality, which is often achieved through the integration of micro-glissandi and micro-intervals (intervals of less than one semitone). Dusapin combines both micro-intervals and regular intervals into melodic lines so that the listener never knows what to expect next. Even so, Dusapin manages to make his use of microtonality feel completely natural. As Stoïnova explains, &quot;The micro-intervals and the micro-glissandi ... in such instrumental works as &quot;Inside&quot; (1980) for viola, &quot;Incisa&quot; (1982) for cello, and many other pieces are, in effect, completely integrated as different by entirely &#x27;natural&#x27; components in extremely supple melodic progressions&quot;. The listener is already familiar with the uniform division of the octave in equal intervals; Dusapin merely divides the octave by a less traditional number.

===Musical form===
Dusapin rejects the hierarchical, binary forms of most European music, but neither is his music aleatory. Dusapin characterizes the European &quot;hierarchical&quot; form as thinking in terms of variations, so that certain parts are always of more importance than others. Instead of composing in this way, Dusapin seems to compose measure by measure, deciding what he wants to happen next when he gets there. This process slightly alludes to the chance-like aspect of aleatory music, but Dusapin&#x27;s music is so precisely composed that it cannot truly be aleatoric. Stoïnova writes, &quot;With regard to Dusapin&#x27;s music we can observe a principle of auto-organization and complexity in the compositional system through the integration or assimilation of aleatory disturbances.&quot; In other words, Dusapin lets the music go where it will, often evoking aleatory idioms, while still notating everything and maintaining control of his music. He avoids repetition and rejects stability and redundancy in music, which is yet another distinguishing feature of his music.

===Tension, energy, and movement===
Perhaps the most prominent and unique element of Dusapin&#x27;s music is its built-in tension, energy, and sense of movement. Indeed, in his article on Dusapin, Julian Anderson cites the &quot;enclosing tensions&quot; and &quot;explosive flight&quot; as the two extremes of Dusapin&#x27;s early music and claims that these idioms are what make the composer&#x27;s music so highly individual. Stoïnova also emphasizes the energy that is present in Dusapin&#x27;s earlier compositions, giving credit to Dusapin&#x27;s use of extreme registers, flutter tongue, trills, micro-intervals, glissandi, multiphonics, rapid articulations, drastic dynamics, and continuous breathing. These unique features make Dusapin&#x27;s music incredibly intense and demanding on its performers. In fact, the intensity is such that Dusapin consciously makes pieces like &quot;Musique captive&quot; (1980) have short durations (in this case, three minutes), for by their ends the musicians and listeners alike are completely exhausted.

===Later characteristics===
Many of the characteristics discussed above are especially prevalent in Dusapin&#x27;s earlier works, especially those from the 1980s. Beginning in the next decade, Dusapin&#x27;s work moved more and more toward greater harmonic and melodic simplicity. Paul Griffiths notes that Dusapin&#x27;s works from the 1990s are more harmonically conceived than his previous music, and that they incorporate more folk traditions, including the use of drones and modes. He further suggests that Dusapin continued to simplify his music as he moved into the twenty-first century, and that while the composer still avoids diatonicism, he uses techniques like oscillating between two notes and constantly varying small patterns, which involve more repetition than his past music.

==Collaboration with Accroche Note==
The instrumentation of Dusapin&#x27;s music is often based upon available players, and during the 1980s and 1990s, he often wrote for the Ensemble Accroche Note, a Strasbourg-based new music group founded by a singer and clarinetist. Ian Pace proposes that the influence of the group&#x27;s clarinetist Armand Angster might be a reason for the prominence of the clarinet in much of Dusapin&#x27;s music from this time period. Griffiths, too, makes note of the important role of the clarinet in the series of shorter pieces that Dusapin wrote after the completion of his first opera, Roméo et Juliette (1985–89). Dusapin&#x27;s tendency to write for specific instrumentalists (in this case, clarinetist Angster) reveal a practical and realistic side of the composer.

==Notable works==

===&quot;Musique captive&quot; (1980) and &quot;Musique fugitive&quot; (1980)===
Two of Dusapin&#x27;s earlier works composed in the same year, &quot;Musique captive&quot; (1980) and &quot;Musique fugitive&quot; (1980), might be studied together in that they are both unstable and aim to avoid any sort of repetition. At the same time, however, the pieces go about achieving these goals in two very different ways. &quot;Musique captive&quot; is written for nine wind instruments (piccolo, oboe, soprano saxophone, bass clarinet, contrabass clarinet, contrabassoon, two trumpets, and bass trombone) and lasts just three minutes, for, as Stoïnova suggests, the tension and high demands on the performers are such that the piece could not last any longer. Stoïnova further describes the piece as internally destroying itself, writing, &quot;The musical ideas of this piece—tremolo textures, a rising chromatic figure, violent crescendi, an expanding mass of detail etc.—destroy each other or to be more exact annihilate each other.&quot; Dusapin thus throws many musical ideas together, a concept that Pace relates to free jazz. The resulting music is highly unstable and simply cannot endure longer than its three-minute duration. The piece was first performed in July 1981 in La Rochelle, France.

&quot;Musique fugitive&quot;, on the other hand, achieves its instability through musical &quot;ruptures.&quot; Written for string trio, the piece avoids the traditional process of statement and variation, thus breaking away from any sense of unity and continuity. Dusapin achieves this effect by stating one idea, then abruptly changing course through either sudden silence or the introduction of a new musical progression. Premiered in Aix-en-Provence, France, in June 1980, &quot;Musique fugitive&quot;, Pugin claims, has become &quot;virtually a repertoire piece in France.&quot; The Arditti String Quartet recording of the piece can be heard on Spotify.

===&quot;La Rivière&quot; (1979) and &quot;L&#x27;Aven&quot; (1980–81)===
&quot;La Rivière&quot; (1979) and &quot;L&#x27;Aven&quot; (1980–81) are two orchestral pieces based on ideas of nature that, according to Julian Anderson, show off the &quot;more exuberant, violent side of Dusapin&#x27;s style.&quot; Both pieces focus on characteristics of water and symbolize its fluidity and strength through music. The first piece opens with solo cello, which &quot;spreads through&quot; and &quot;absorbs&quot; the whole orchestra, as water would do. Indeed, in this piece Dusapin aims to realize the &quot;movement of changing speeds, of the strength of flow.&quot; &quot;L&#x27;Aven&quot;, on the other hand, captures the image of water slowly dripping and opening a hollow in stone. A concerto for flute and orchestra, the work begins with the flute being just barely audible over the orchestra, but it gradually pushes its way through the orchestral texture until it is the prominent voice of the work. Thus, the flute represents the dripping water, and the orchestra represents the stone. The flute plays without stop for ten minutes, always pushing against the orchestra and ultimately coming out on top. Both pieces received their premiere in Metz, France: &quot;La Rivière&quot; in November 1979, and &quot;L&#x27;Aven&quot; in November 1983.

===&quot;Niobé ou le Rocher de Sypile&quot; (1982)===
&quot;Niobé ou le Rocher de Sypile&quot; (1982) is a thirty-eight-minute work for twelve mixed voices, solo soprano (Niobé), and eight instruments (oboe doubling English horn, two clarinets [the second doubling bass clarinet], two bassoons [the second doubling contrabassoon], trumpet and two tenor trombones), with a neo-Latin text by Martine Irzenski. Irzenski&#x27;s text is taken from fragments of Latin literary works and does not necessarily follow the chronology of the Greek myth of Niobe. Dusapin himself classifies the work as a &quot;staged oratorio&quot;, rather than an opera or piece of musical theatre, and in it he once again avoids repetition and continuity and seeks to freely make textural connections. The solo soprano voice is pitted against the twelve voices of the mixed chorus, who serve a number of different purposes throughout the course of the work, sometimes extending the timbre of Niobé&#x27;s voice, sometimes moving in relation to the text. In his article on Dusapin, Anderson also highlights the variety of vocal techniques and textures used in the oratorio, including microtonal chords for the chorus and the monodic soprano line at the end of the work. Through its non-linear text and multiple textural layers, &#x27;Niobé ou le Rocher de Sypile&#x27; maintains the same sense of discontinuity as Dusapin&#x27;s earlier chamber works. The work was first performed in Paris on 16 June 1984.

===&quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (1985–88)===
According to Ian Pace, Dusapin&#x27;s first opera, &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (1985–88) is the &quot;pivotal work&quot; in the composer&#x27;s career, for it is in this work that he first &quot;properly&quot; combines his ideas of narrative to the theatrical realm. Pugin views Dusapin&#x27;s opera as a return to the &quot;more fruitful&quot; style of &quot;Niobé&quot;, and cites Dusapin&#x27;s vocal pieces &quot;Mimi&quot; (1986–87), &quot;Il-Li-Ko&quot; (1987), and &quot;Anacoluthe&quot; (1987) as study pieces for the creation of his first opera, particularly for the setting of the French language. Anderson, meanwhile, notes the greater amount of lyricism that exists in Dusapin&#x27;s opera as compared to his earlier works. All three authors seem to agree that the opera is a noteworthy point in Dusapin&#x27;s compositional career.

The libretto, written by Olivier Cadiot, is divided into nine numbers: the first four dealing with events before the revolution, the final four involving events after the revolution, and the fifth and central number being the revolution itself. This central movement is the only one played purely by the orchestra. The opera focuses not only on Roméo and Juliette, but also on their doubles, Roméo 2 and Juliette 2, who appear before the revolution and seem to symbolize &quot;an expansion of their personalities.&quot; The opera also involves a chorus that comments on the action and a vocal quartet that serves as an intermediary and teaches Roméo and Juliette revolutionary concepts. Finally, there is the character of Bill, who teaches Roméo and Juliette to sing, but who himself only speaks until the eighth number, when he at last sings as well. In the latter half of the work, the characters discuss the possibility of creating a real opera, only to discover the &quot;impossibility of opera, the story and even language itself&quot;, and the music breaks down into microtonality and fragmentation. The opera was premiered on 10 June 1989 in Montpellier, France.

===&quot;Seven Solos for Orchestra&quot; (1992–2009)===
His next major project was the large-scale orchestral cycle &quot;Seven Solos for Orchestra&quot; composed between 1992 and 2009. It consists of seven works that can be played independently but were from the start conceived as a whole.

In the composer&#x27;s own words:

The cycle treats the orchestra as a large solo instrument and is the closest Dusapin has come to traditional symphonic thinking.

===Current projects===

In May 2016, Alisa Weilerstein and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra premièred &quot;Outscape&quot;, Dusapin&#x27;s second cello concerto, to positive critical reception. The same year Dusapin was invited to Geneva in the framework of the Arts at CERN programme.

His most recent opera, &quot;Macbeth Underworld&quot;, premièred at La Monnaie in Brussels in September 2019.

<text>Giessen, spelled  in German (), is a town in the German state () of Hesse, capital of both the district of Giessen and the administrative region of Giessen. The population is approximately 90,000, with roughly 37,000 university students.

The name comes from &quot;Giezzen&quot;, as it was first referred to in 1197, which refers to the position of the town between several rivers, lakes and streams. The largest river in Giessen is the Lahn, which divides the town in two parts (west and east), roughly north of Frankfurt am Main. Giessen is also home to the University of Giessen.

In 1969, the town hosted the ninth &quot;Hessentag&quot; state festival.

==History==
Giessen came into being as a moated castle in 1152 built by Count Wilhelm von Gleiberg, although the history of the community in the northeast and in today&#x27;s suburb called &quot;Wieseck&quot; dates back to 775. The town became part of Hesse-Marburg in 1567, passing to Hesse-Darmstadt in 1604. The University of Giessen was founded in 1607. Giessen was included within the Grand Duchy of Hesse created in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars. After the First World War, it was part of the People&#x27;s State of Hesse.

During the Second World War, a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp was in the . Heavy bombing destroyed about 75 percent of Giessen in 1944, including most of the town&#x27;s historic buildings. It became part of the modern state of Hesse after the war.

In 1977, Giessen was merged with the neighbouring city Wetzlar to form the new city of Lahn. However, this attempt to reorganize the administration was reversed in 1979. It was part of the Darmstadt region (regierungsbezirk) between 1945 and 1981, until the Giessen (region) was founded on 1 January 1981.

A U.S. military base was located in Giessen after the Second World War. The U.S. Army Garrison of Gießen had a population of up to 10,000 American soldiers and their families. Gießen was also the site of the central US army depot for all of Europe as well as the site of a special ammunition depot. The base is a converted German Army Air Field which is reflected in some of the buildings including the housing area. A theatre, known as the Keller Theatre, is a converted German Army Officers&#x27; Club. As of 28 September 2007, the Giessen Depot and all other U.S. facilities in the greater Giessen area were returned to local German authorities. The former U.S. Army buildings were used to house refugees after the large influx of 2016.

After the war, the city was twinned with Winchester, UK.

<doc id="393008" wikidata="Q1123538" url="?curid=393008" title="Volvo S60">
<text>The Volvo S60 is a compact executive car manufactured and marketed by Volvo since 2000.

The first generation (2000–2009) was launched in autumn of 2000 in order to replace the S70 and was based on the P2 platform, and the similarly designed estate version, the Volvo V70. A high performance engine and sports-oriented suspension version called S60 R was launched at the Paris Motor Show in 2002. Styling cues were taken from the ECC concept car and the S80.

The second generation (2010–2018) was released in 2010 for the 2011 model year and has its own estate version, known as the Volvo V60.

The third generation joined the Volvo line-up in 2018 for the 2019 model year. It is built on a shortened version of the Scalable Product Architecture platform, in America&#x27;s first Volvo factory in Ridgeville, South Carolina. The US became the sole global source of the S60 sedan after production in China was phased out in early 2019.


== First generation (2000)==
The S60 was built on Volvo&#x27;s P2 platform, which was shared with other Volvo models like the S80, V70, XC70 and finally the XC90.

The Volvo S60 was released in 2000 (2001 model year) being the company&#x27;s new generation sports sedan. The S60 is aimed to mainly compete in Europe with the BMW 3 Series (E46), the Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W203) and the Alfa Romeo 156. Unlike its rivals, the Volvo S60 continued production for 9 years with multiple facelifts. When it was introduced the appearance was unlike the squared vehicles offered in previous years, and continued the new design tradition introduced by the larger S80, utilizing a cab forward approach and was more organic appearing with a pronounced shelf along the beltline that ran the length of the vehicle, achieving a drag coefficient. Volvo continued its safety tradition, offering front and rear integrated crumple zones, driver and front passenger dual threshold airbags with a collapsible three-stage steering column, Side Impact Protection System (SIPS) supplemented with air bags for driver and front passenger, along with a side curtain airbag for front and rear passengers, anti-submarine seats, five padded head restraints with Whiplash Protection System (WHIPS), and automatic seat belt pretensioners while front belts also have height adjustment.

In 2004 PremAir™ was introduced as a standard feature to the exterior radiator surface which converts up to 75 percent of ground level ozone in the radiator cooling air into oxygen, while the Interior Air Quality System cleans the air inside, detects for pollutants and automatically recirculates in comparison to the air outside. The upholstery was available in taupe, light sand or graphite with indigo inserts and the leathers were tanned using natural plant materials. The S60 sheet metal content can be recycled, along with other metals that achieved an 85 overall percentage. Dual zone climate control and heated front seats along with a three position drivers memory setting were optional, and anti-smash and grab laminated side windows were available. Two , three and one aluminum alloy wheel choices were available.

The S60 came standard with Volvo&#x27;s own radio unit, the HU-613, the HU-803 and was later upgraded to the HU-650 and an optional extra HU-850 unit. The HU-850 unit features a 225 or 335-watt power output (depending on optional external amplifier) with three presets: 2CH, 3CH and Dolby Digital Pro Logic II Surround Sound. The Four-C chassis from the S60 R became an option on some S60s.

In 2004 the T5 engine was reengineered from 2.3 to 2.4 liters, installing continuously variable valve timing and achieving an increase of , while the 2.5 liter engine was given a Ultra-low-emission vehicle (ULEV) certification, and a modified turbo in the D5 model also increased the maximum claimed power from 163 PS to 185 PS, while electronic brakeforce distribution was installed for emergency braking situations. The Haldex-sourced computer controlled AWD system, which was standard equipment in the S60R, was optionally available mated to the 2.5 liter engine. Three transmissions were offered, the Geartronic automatic which offered five speeds that adapts to driving style or the &quot;Auto-Stick&quot; offers a manual mode that offered the ability to select gears by moving the gearstick forward or back. The second automatic five speed transmission was available without the manual mode feature. A more traditional manual five speed transmission was the third selection offered.

The S60 was refreshed in 2005. The exterior was updated with body-colored side moldings and bumpers with chrome linings, as well as new headlamps replacing the original with black housing, with optional HID headlights. The interior received some updates as well, with new seats, trim, and an updated center console. The S60 went through a final facelift in 2008 with full body-colored bumper and door inserts and larger emblem in the front and larger spaced out &quot;V-O-L-V-O&quot; letters in the rear. The interior featured a new pattern upholstery which differs from its original pattern.

===First-generation models===
====S60 Police specification (UK &amp; EU)====
Police specification models came about through Volvo&#x27;s extensive work alongside the users of the vehicles and Police Fleet Management departments. As a result, the Police specification vehicles have a striking difference from original showroom model that sometimes the Volvo S60 is used as police cars.
Firstly the suspension was up-rated to deal with the demands of Police work; this included fitting the front suspension of the D5 model variant (as the suspension was designed to deal with the heavier diesel engine). Nivomat self-levelling suspension was also fitted to the rear to ensure correct geometry of the vehicle, regardless of the weight carried. On early models, the clutch was also replaced with the stronger D5 unit.

A larger specification battery and 110A alternator was also fitted to run all the extra equipment, along with a dedicated Police fuse box in the boot. Extra wiring looms are also fitted specially for the Police radios and other equipment, including CCTV cameras. Additional electrical noise suppression has been added so as not to interfere with the sensitive electronics the police use.

The speedometers in the vehicles are calibrated from the factory and do not require recalibration unless the wheel and overall rolling diameters are changed.

 vented front disc brakes were also fitted alongside special brake pads (and wear indicators) specially designed to cope with high-speed pursuits.

During 2001–2004 the 2.3 litre T5 engine was used and in 2005-2009 the 2.4 litre T5 engine was used. Also beyond common speculation and myths, the engines are not chipped or modified specially for police use: they are complete factory spec but in &#x27;exceptional cases&#x27; the speed limiter () may have been removed.

====S60 R====
First introduced in 2004, Volvo&#x27;s S60 R used a Haldex computer controlled all-wheel-drive system mated to a / inline-5 which sends 95 percent of the torque to the front wheels under normal driving conditions and can send up to 70 percent to the rear wheels as necessary. The 2004–2005 models came with a 6-speed manual transmission, or an available 5-speed automatic which allowed only torque in 1st and 2nd gears. The 2006–2007 models came with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission (which was no longer torque-restricted).

Other aspects which set the R apart from standard S60s were the large Brembo front and rear four-piston brakes, 18-inch 5-spoke &quot;Pegasus&quot; wheels (available as an upgrade to the standard 17-inch wheels of the same design), blue faced &quot;R&quot; gauges, standard HID headlights, as well as the Four-C suspension system.

Semi-active suspension with Four-C (a short name for &quot;Continuously Controlled Chassis Concept&quot;) allows the user to select from three modes: Comfort, Sport, and Advanced. &quot;Comfort&quot; attempts to soften the car over bumps, while &quot;Advanced&quot; firms the suspension considerably and gives more aggressive throttle response - a setting Volvo implies is for use on the race track. This is accomplished through a drive by wire throttle, allowing the same pedal travel to result in different performance when the appropriate mode is selected, electronically controlled shock absorbers that can adjust themselves 500 times a second, and a complex series of sensors throughout the body of the vehicle. Volvo collaborated with high-tech system developer Ohlins Racing AB and shock absorber manufacturer Monroe for the self-adjusting shock absorbers.

The R had three themed interior color options with upholstery in soft leather supplied by Bridge of Weir, and they were Nordkapp (dark blue) or Gobi (light tan). A third choice was offered as a natural leather option, Atacama (dark orange), available for an additional charge. The natural leather choice was sumptuous with a baseball glove thickness and feel.

The small trunk lid spoiler that was standard on the S60 R created a 20% increased downforce at the rear wheels at high speeds compared to the standard S60s. The S60 Rs have a 0.29 Drag coefficient, compared to the standard S60&#x27;s 0.28, due to the larger lower front bumper spoiler to support the secondary intercooler.

Another Volvo factory option for only the S60 R was a body kit which included front bumper splitters, side skirts and a rear valance, color matched to the body. The body kit was only available with certain body colors and in certain markets.

The S60 R continued the tradition of &quot;R&quot; cars for Volvo beginning in 1995 with the introduction of the 850 T-5 R.

== Second generation (2010)==


The second generation S60 began production in Ghent, Belgium on May 17, 2010, with an expected annual production of 90,000 vehicles. Official photos were released in November 2009, and the car was publicly unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2010. It debuted as a 2011 model in North America. The second generation S60 also arrived with the 5th generation Haldex AWD system. More differences in the second generation S60 include the new large Volvo iron symbol, parallel to the grille LED day running lamps and larger spaced letters in the brand name on rear.

The engine range of the S60 and V60 comprises four petrol engines and three diesels. The engines available are the T3, T4, T5 and T6 petrol engines and D3, D5 and 1.6D DRIVe diesel engines, the latter of which has Stop Start Technology to increase the efficiency of the engine. The 2.4-litre D5 plug-in hybrid version, fitted with a five-cylinder diesel engine and a 50 kW electric motor, was scheduled for sale in Europe by November 2012.

The Volvo S60 and V60 come with Volvo&#x27;s City Safety system as standard, which is the same system fitted to its sister the XC60. This system stops the car in the event of impending collision in &#x27;City Traffic&#x27; below . Also, a new safety feature named &quot;Pedestrian Detection&quot; (available on both the V60 and S60) detects people in front of the car and automatically applies the brakes if the driver does not react in time. The new sedan shows off Volvo&#x27;s completely new design language already seen in the Volvo XC60 concept. It rides on the same platform as the XC60. The goal of this new design was to target younger demographics.

===2013 T5 engine update===
In 2013, the T5 engine was revamped before the launch of the Drive-E arrival. Among the tweaks to the T5 power plant is a boost in engine compression to 9.5:1 from 9.0, engine torque peaks at 4200 rpm and engine management changes provide faster gear changes and upshifts when the 6-speed automatic gearbox is in the sport mode. Output remains the same over 2012 at and of torque, although there is a provision for overboost from the turbo which bumps the torque number to . The changes in compression ratio helps the S60 T5 deliver extra in the city and combined cycle. Front-drive versions are rated at city/ highway for a combined of , while the AWD model is less across the board. Volvo also says the T5 AWD is good for a sprint of 6.6 seconds, while the front-drive version is 0.2 seconds quicker.

===2014 model year update===
Changes include all-new exterior panels from the A-pillars forward including a new hood, front fenders and fascia; a wider grille with a larger Ironmark is flanked by new headlights while a larger, wider lower front intake gains bright accents and horizontally mounted LED daytime running lights; new integrated exhaust pipes at rear, a new Adaptive Digital TFT Display instrument cluster for select models (R-Design versions include unique blue instrument dials), new paddle shifters on T6 AWD and R-Design models (optional on T5), Advanced Quick Shift (AQS) option on all T6 engines and activated when the transmission is set to sport mode or when using paddle shifters, IntelliSafe with Pedestrian Detection and Cyclist Detection with full auto brake and Cross Traffic Alert became part of the Technology Package, a new radar-based Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) to monitor and alert the driver to rapidly approaching vehicles behind the car while still informing the driver about vehicles in the blind spots on both sides of the car, Cross Traffic Alert with radar sensors at the rear end of the car to alert the driver to crossing traffic from the sides when reversing out of a parking space.

North America models went on sale as 2014 model year vehicles in late 2013. Early models include S60 T5 (base, Premier, Premier Plus, Platinum), T6 (AWD, Premier Plus, Platinum, R-Design AWD, RD Platinum).

==Motorsport==

The S60 has been raced in a range of championships across Europe, North America and Australia.

===Europe===
Volvo regularly entered the S60 in the Swedish Touring Car Championship, where it finished 2nd in the drivers&#x27; championship twice and won the manufacturers&#x27; title once. The S60 continued to be raced after the formation of the Scandinavian Touring Car Championship, a merger of the Swedish and Danish touring car championships. Thed Björk won three consecutive titles from 2013 to 2015, and Rikard Göransson won the championship in 2016, driving an S60 prepared by Polestar Racing.

From 2002 to 2007 there was an S60 one-make racing series as a support series to the Swedish Touring Car Championship known as the S60 Challenge Cup, using 26 factory-modified S60s.

An S60 was driven by Robert Dahlgren in the Swedish round of the 2007 World Touring Car Championship.

In 2016 the S60 made its return to the WTCC with Fredrik Ekblom and Thed Björk driving for Polestar Cyan Racing. Their 2017 lineup consists of Thed Björk, Nestor Girolami and Nick Catsburg.

===North America===
The first generation S60 made its competitive debut in 2006, racing in the Speed World Challenge GT class. The second-generation model was introduced for the 2009 season. In 2010, its programme was expanded to include the SCCA Pro Racing World Challenge, where it won both the drivers&#x27; championship, for factory driver Randy Pobst, his fourth, and manufacturers&#x27; championships in the GT class. The programme was expanded again in 2011 to include the Pirelli World Challenge.

===Australia===

Volvo competed in the V8 Supercars Championship with two rear wheel drive V8 B8444S powered S60s between 2014 and 2016 with Garry Rogers Motorsport highlighted by a debut 2nd place at the Adelaide 500, a last second overtake to steal a race win at the Phillip Island Circuit, and third for Scott McLaughlin in the 2016 series driver standings.
==Sales and marketing==

===Product placement===
In Stephenie Meyer&#x27;s popular &quot;Twilight&quot; novel series, it is suggested that Edward drives a &quot;shiny&quot; and &quot;silver&quot; first generation Volvo S60-R, a fast sleeper car that doesn&#x27;t call attention to the Cullen family&#x27;s wealth. The film series partnered with Volvo to place a Volvo C30 in the 2008 &quot;Twilight&quot; film, feeling that the C30 better suited the persona of a 108 year old vampire pretending to be a 17-year-old high school student. Volvo reported an increase in the sale of the C30 in the US market following the film&#x27;s release, and helped change the perception of Volvo as a &quot;cool&quot; car in a younger generation of buyers. Volvo continued the partnership through the series, placing the second generation S60 in the 2011 film, &quot;Twilight:Breaking Dawn&quot;.

<text>Baseball Stars is a 1989 baseball video game developed and published by SNK for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was also released in arcades by Nintendo through their PlayChoice-10 arcade system.

==Features==
&quot;Baseball Stars&quot; was the first baseball game to have battery backup on any console, and the first NES sports game to have battery backup. This allowed players to create a team, configure baseball league &amp; play a season, and the game&#x27;s memory chip stored cumulative statistics. &quot;Baseball Stars&quot; was also the first sports game for the NES to have a &quot;create a player&quot; feature, giving gamers the power to name their players, as well as their teams. The game also introduced a role playing element; as each game played earns the winning team money, and the amount won is directly related to the sum of the &quot;prestige&quot; ratings of the players from both teams (as prestige determines how many paying fans attend the game). The money can be used to purchase upgrades to the various abilities of players currently on the roster, or it can be used to purchase pre-designed players (available in the &quot;Rookie&quot;, &quot;Veteran&quot;, and &quot;All-Star&quot; categories). Also a first, a hidden feature allows players to hire female baseball players.

==Gameplay==

Simple graphics are coupled with repetitive upbeat 8-bit music. The pitching is simple: curve balls, fast balls, off-speed pitches, and sinkers. The batting is a swing on a level plane, thus it is simply a question of timing. The fielding, at the time, was a revolution in arcade baseball; it achieved a level of realism unseen prior to its release. This realism, coupled with ease-of-fielding features contributed to the game&#x27;s popularity. These ease-of-fielding features are characterized by examples such as off-screen fielders automatically drifting towards fly balls, fielders catching balls anywhere near them, the ability to jump and dive, infielders shifting to prevent extra base hits down the line when men are on base, etc.

It is possible to deliver unhittable pitches that would &quot;drop&quot; as they crossed home plate, the only clue would be a high-pitched squeak as the pitch came towards home plate. However, despite the high sound, sometimes these pitches failed to drop and in fact crossed home plate for strikes.

===Seasons and vs.===

&quot;Baseball Stars&quot; includes a simple one-off versus mode, but it provides the option of creating a mini-league of up to six teams, with each team playing up to 25 games against every other team. That means a season with a maximum 125 game schedule can be created. When making a season, one chooses how many teams, how many games, and which teams are controlled by the AI (computer) and which are controlled by the gamers. In vs. mode, no stats, such as wins, losses, hits, or home runs are kept but money can still be won when a &quot;player&quot; controlled team plays against an &quot;AI&quot;-controlled team. No money is won in this mode when it is player vs. player. Versus mode games can be considered exhibition games.

===Teams===
There can be a total of 14 teams. Eight teams come with the game and six more teams can be created. The original eight cannot in any way be edited or changed.

Although the game does not use any real Major League Baseball teams, one of the default teams, the American Dreams, included players with names that are based on real (former) baseball players such as &quot;Pete&quot; (Pete Rose), &quot;Hank&quot; (Hank Aaron), &quot;Babe&quot; (Babe Ruth), &quot;Sandie&quot; (Sandy Koufax), &quot;Cy&quot; (Cy Young), &quot;Denny&quot; (Denny McLain), and &quot;Willie&quot; (Willie Mays). In addition, the Japan Robins included a player named &quot;Oh,&quot; presumably after Sadaharu Oh of Japan&#x27;s Nippon Professional Baseball.

The other default teams are the Ninja BlackSox, Brave Warriors, Japan Robins, World Powers, Ghastly Monsters, Lovely Ladies (an all women&#x27;s team), and SNK Crushers.

When creating a new team, one is given the option of choosing its main strength (for example defense, running, batting, balanced, etc.). This does not mean that a chosen strength will remain with the team forever. The option simply favors the chosen attribute when the computer randomly generates the players. Each new team gets about $30,000 and 18 players (5 pitchers, 8 batters, and 5 pinch hitters) to start. From there, games are played and games that are won earn money for the team. Players on created teams can be modified and improved as well as traded amongst other created teams. A pitcher cannot be traded for a batter; it must always be batter for batter or pitcher for pitcher. There is also a &quot;free agent&quot; market in which players can be bought ranging in price from $5,000 to $2,980,000. Since there is a limit of 18 players per team, before a free agent can be bought, a player must be fired. If a player is traded for a player with superior attributes, the better player&#x27;s attributes are diminished. Each player also has a maximum number of attribute points possible (out of 90) with some players having higher eventual potential than others.

===Statistics===
In season play, the game keeps track of various stats. By going into the SEE STANDINGS menu, it can be seen how each team&#x27;s win–loss record compares to the other team(s). The player can also view the top ten leaders in batting average, home runs, RBIs, pitching ERA, pitching wins, and saves.

Each individual player&#x27;s batting average and home run totals can be seen when that player is up to bat and individual pitcher&#x27;s ERA is shown when that pitcher is pitching. With the exception of a pitcher&#x27;s ERA, stats are current when a player steps into the batter&#x27;s box.

===Mercy rules===
The game has a 10-run mercy rule. Thus, if at the end of any inning, one team is up by at least 10 runs, the game is called in favor of the leading team. In addition to the 10-run mercy rule, there is also a 100-run mercy rule. If at any point in the game one team attains a lead of 100 or more, play is immediately stopped and a winner is declared, even though the inning is not over. For example, if the visiting team scores 100 runs in the top of the first inning, the visiting team will be declared the winner and the home team will not even have the chance to bat. If the game remains tied after 18 innings, the game is over and no winner is declared; all hits and other stats are not saved - as if the game never happened.

=== Player improvements ===
As stated above, when money is won, it can be applied to upgrade a player. For batters, there are six abilities that can be augmented. For pitchers, there are eleven. Each ability can be assigned up to 15 points. Each player has a maximum number of points allowed and the higher the &quot;max&quot; of the player, the more valuable he could become.

==Reception==
&quot;Baseball Stars&quot; was a critical success, often referred to as the best baseball game on the NES platform, and as such, has become a franchise series for SNK, spawning five sequels, and its &quot;create player&quot; and &quot;create team&quot; functions have become standard features in sports games. In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; ranked the NES version as number 87 on their &quot;100 Best Games of All Time&quot;. Citing the customizable teams and players, full season play, stat tracking, and sense of fun, they assessed it as &quot;every bit as fun as it was eight years ago when it was the best baseball game the NES ever saw&quot;. IGN placed it at #28 in the article &quot;Top 100 NES Games&quot;. Baseball Stars placed #3 on Yahoo!&#x27;s &quot;Top 5 Best Old School Sports Video Games&quot;. Baseball Stars was once voted most popular baseball game according to a poll taken by Nintendo Power magazine. David Littman, a producer on EA&#x27;s NHL series of games, stated that the popular GM mode in those games was originally inspired by Baseball Stars. It received a perfect 5-star rating in the book &quot;Ultimate Nintendo: Guide to the NES Library 1985–1995&quot;.

==Sequels==
In 1991, a sequel, &quot;Baseball Stars 2&quot;, was released by Romstar, but it was far less popular than the original. Reasons for this included the inability to change the name of a gamer-created team or names of the players on a gamer-created team, and unimproved graphics over the original. Two more sequels were made for SNK&#x27;s console, the Neo-Geo:
* &quot;Baseball Stars Professional&quot; (1990, one of the first Neo-Geo games published) featured all the teams in the original &quot;Baseball Stars&quot; for the NES, but the teams&#x27; features could not be changed, gamers could only play as them.
* &quot;Baseball Stars 2&quot; (1992) featured 18 teams across 2 leagues (exciting league &amp; fighting league) and put more emphasis on graphics and actual gameplay (for example, being able to change pitchers or batters and powering up batters which increased the size of your bat).

Two additional games were made with the &quot;Baseball Stars&quot; title for SNK&#x27;s handheld systems, Neo Geo Pocket and Neo Geo Pocket Color: &quot;Baseball Stars&quot; and &quot;Baseball Stars Color&quot;. &quot;Baseball Stars&quot; was released only in Japan and Europe, but &quot;Baseball Stars Color&quot; was released in North America. &quot;Baseball Stars Color&quot; was later re-released as part of &quot;Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2&quot; in 2022.

Finally there was one other Nintendo baseball game that used that same engine that was featured in &quot;Baseball Stars&quot;, although it was not officially a Baseball Stars game, &quot;Little League Baseball: Championship Series&quot; (1990)

The Neo-Geo game &quot;Super Baseball 2020&quot; share similar gameplay with the series, but in a futuristic, science fiction settings.
