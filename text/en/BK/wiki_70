<text>John Singleton Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst, (21 May 1772 – 12 October 1863) was a British lawyer and politician. He was three times Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.

==Background and education==
Lyndhurst was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of painter John Singleton Copley and his wife Susanna Farnham (née Clarke), granddaughter of silversmith Edward Winslow. His father left America to live in London in 1774, and his wife and son followed a year later. Copley was educated at a private school and Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Political and legal career==
Called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1804, he gained a considerable practice. He was appointed a serjeant-at-law on 6 July 1813. In 1817, he was one of the counsel for James Watson, tried for his share in the Spa Fields riots. Lyndhurst&#x27;s performance attracted the attention of Lord Castlereagh and other Tory leaders, and he entered parliament as member for Yarmouth in the Isle of Wight. He afterwards sat for Ashburton (1818–1826) and for Cambridge University (1826–1827).

In December 1818, Copley was made King&#x27;s Serjeant and Chief Justice of Chester. He became Solicitor General on 24 July 1819 and was knighted in October, became Attorney General in 1824, Master of the Rolls in 1826 and Lord Chancellor in 1827. On his appointment to the latter post he was raised to the peerage as Baron Lyndhurst, of Lyndhurst in the County of Southampton. As solicitor-general he took a prominent part in the trial of Queen Caroline and was opposed to the Liberal measures which marked the end of the reign of George IV and the beginning of that of William IV. He was Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer from 1831 to 1834. During the Melbourne government from 1835 to 1841 he figured conspicuously as an obstructionist in the House of Lords. His former adversary Lord Brougham, disgusted at his treatment by the Whig leaders, soon became his most powerful ally in opposition. Lyndhurst held the chancellorship from 1827 to 1830, 1834–1835, and 1841–1846. As he was in regard to Catholic emancipation, so in the agitation against the Corn Laws, he opposed reform until Peel, his chief, gave the signal for concession. In 1837 he was Rector of Marischal College (later Aberdeen University).


After 1846 and the disintegration of the Tory party over Peel&#x27;s adoption of free trade, Lord Lyndhurst did not attend parliament sessions as often, but he continued to take a lively interest in public affairs and to make speeches. His address to the House of Lords on 19 June 1854, on the war with Russia, made a sensation in Europe, and throughout the Crimean War he was a strong advocate of the energetic prosecution of hostilities.

In 1854, Copley was appointed to the Royal Commission for Consolidating the Statute Law, a royal commission to consolidate existing statutes and enactments of English law.

In 1859 he denounced Napoleon III. His last speech was delivered in the House of Lords at the age of eighty-nine.

==Family==
In 1819 Lord Lyndhurst married Sarah, a daughter of Charles Brunsden and widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Thomas, who was killed at Waterloo. She died in 1834, and three years later, in August 1837, he married Georgiana Goldsmith (1807–1901), daughter of writer Lewis Goldsmith, of Paris. They had two daughters, Georgiana Susan Copley, who married Sir Charles Du Cane, Governor of Tasmania, and Sophia Clarence Copley (1828–1911), who married Hamilton Beckett and is buried near her father in Highgate Cemetery.

Since his second wife came from a family of Jewish origins, it may be her influence which led Lyndhurst to support the Jewish Emancipation of 1858, when the law which had restricted the Parliamentary oath of office to Christians was changed, leading to the admission of Jews into parliament. Lyndhurst also advocated women&#x27;s rights in questions of divorce.

He died in London on 12 October 1863 and was buried in Highgate Cemetery; as he left no son, his peerage became extinct. Lady Lyndhurst died in London 22 December 1901, aged 94.

<doc id="386783" wikidata="Q7545925" url="?curid=386783" title="Smoke-free Environments Amendment Act 2003">
<text>The Smoke-free Environments Amendment Act 2003 is an Act of Parliament in New Zealand that prohibits smoking in all workplaces including offices, clubs, pubs, restaurants, airports, and schools. 

It was passed by the Parliament of New Zealand on 3 December 2003 and came into force progressively starting 11 December 2003. A total indoor smoking ban was in effect within one year.

==Legislative history==

=== Background and original policy intent ===
New Zealand established some smoking restrictions in indoor spaces in 1990, including on public transport. Smoking on domestic flights had already been illegal since 1988, and on international flights from 1996.

The Smoke-free Environments (Enhanced Protection) Amendment Bill, amending the Smoke-free Environments Act 1990, was originally introduced as a private member&#x27;s bill by Mauri Pacific MP Tuku Morgan in July 1999. After Morgan did not win re-election later that year, the Bill was picked up by Labour MP Steve Chadwick for its first reading on 10 May 2000 before being transferred to fellow Labour MP Judy Keall. Chadwick resumed responsibility for the Bill after Keall declined to seek re-election in 2002.

The bill as originally drafted proposed to extend the provisions of the Smoke-free Environments Act by banning all smoking on school grounds and in school buildings. 

=== Amendments ===
Further restrictions on workplace smoking were proposed through amendments, though a full smoking ban in licensed premises was not originally included. A 2001 supplementary order paper, in Keall&#x27;s name, proposed further amendments, included new provisions to require at least 50% of a licensed premise to be smokefree. The bill, through all its iterations, did not alter the right of smokers to smoke in their private homes and private vehicles.

The bill and supplementary order paper were considered by the Health Committee for nearly three years. In its report of March 2003, the committee recommended stronger smoke-free measures. It proposed Parliament prohibit smoking in all indoor workplaces, including bars, casinos, members’ clubs and restaurants. These measures ultimately became law.

As much as public health, the policy arguments became focused on workplace relations and safety. The committee stated the purpose of the law would be &quot;to extend the protections for workers, volunteers and the public in the Smoke-free Environments Act 1990 particularly against exposure to second-hand smoke, to reduce the harm caused to individuals by their smoking, to further restrict minors’ access to smoking products and the visual influence of smoking in front of minors, and to provide limited enforcement powers.&quot; The amended bill would require employers to &quot;take all reasonable steps&quot; to ensure workplaces are smokefree, except for dedicated smoking rooms. The committee received 397 submissions, not including over 7,500 form submissions, and heard 112 oral submissions across two parliamentary terms.

In its consideration by the Committee of the whole House through August to November 2003, amendments by Green Party MP Sue Kedgley were agreed that removed proposed instant fines of up to $400 for individual smokers (infringement provisions of $4000 for non-compliant proprietors remained) and additionally banned sales of toys that imitate the act of smoking to children. 

Amendments proposed by United Future leader Peter Dunne, which have would overturned the smoking ban and instead required bar owners to meet ventilation standards, were lost. An attempt by Dunne to have the bill returned to the Health Committee for further consideration was also lost. Amendments from National Party MP Richard Worth to exclude cigar bars from the legislation were lost. National MPs Katherine Rich, David Carter, John Carter, Maurice Williamson, Simon Power, Lindsay Tisch, and Pansy Wong proposed amendments that would have omitted specified licensed premises in their local communities from being covered by the bill; these were ruled out of order by the chairperson Clem Simich because they amounted to private bills rather than public bills. Members recalled the Speaker to confirm this ruling; Speaker Jonathan Hunt upheld the ruling.

=== Third reading and vote ===
In her third reading speech in Parliament on 3 December 2003, the bill&#x27;s sponsor Steve Chadwick said the intention was to improve health throughout the country. Chadwick&#x27;s main claim was that the bill would save the lives of about 388 New Zealanders a year who would otherwise have died from inhaling second hand smoke. She said it would reduce allied disabilities and hospital admissions, as well as discourage non-smokers from becoming smokers. Members speaking against the legislation criticised it for being &quot;anti-business&quot; and for taking away &quot;personal freedoms&quot; from New Zealanders. Opponents also predicted the law would either be ignored or would cost the hospitality industry $78 million per year, and labelled it &quot;political correctness gone mad.&quot;

MPs had a conscience vote on the issue, deciding 68–52 in favour of the bill in its third reading on 3 December 2003. All Labour, Green, and Progressive Party MPs voted in support. Most National MPs (except doctors Paul Hutchison and Lynda Scott), New Zealand First MPs (except Pita Paraone) and all ACT New Zealand MPs voted against.

==Enforcement==
The first successful prosecution under the Smokefree Environments Amendment Act came in December 2005 at the Timaru District Court. The defendant, Geoff Mulvihill, received a NZ$9,000 fine (and $6000 in costs) for failing to enforce the legislation in his tavern.

==Legacy==
One year after the Act was passed, the Asthma and Respiratory Foundation released a report showing that there has been no reduction in the number of bar patrons or bar takings. There has been an increase in the number of non-smokers at bars and cafes. Rural pubs may have suffered a loss of patronage. In 2004, Action on Smoking and Health released a report stating that the proportion of 14- to 16-year-olds who smoked had declined from 28.6% in 1999 to 17.6%, and attributed this in part to the legislation requiring smoke-free school grounds.

<doc id="386784" wikidata="Q4670298" url="?curid=386784" title="Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham">
<text>Charles Christopher Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham, (; 29 April 178129 April 1851) was an English lawyer, judge and politician. He was twice Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.

==Background and education==
Cottenham was born in London, the second son of Sir William Pepys, 1st Baronet, a master in chancery, who was descended from John Pepys, of Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, a great-uncle of Samuel Pepys the diarist. Educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, Pepys was called to the bar of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1804.

==Legal and political career==
Cottenham&#x27;s progress was slow practising at the Chancery Bar. Not until 22 years after his call was he made a King&#x27;s Counsel. He sat in Parliament successively for Higham Ferrers and Malton, became Solicitor General in 1834 and Master of the Rolls in the same year.

On the formation of Lord Melbourne&#x27;s second administration in April 1835, the great seal was in commission for a time, but Cottenham, who had been a commissioner, was eventually appointed Lord Chancellor in January 1836 and at the same time was raised to the peerage as Baron Cottenham of Cottenham in the County of Cambridge. He held office until the ministry&#x27;s defeat in August 1841.

==Earldom==
In February 1841, during the trial of Lord Cardigan for attempted murder, Cottenham claimed ill health, leaving the task of presiding as Lord High Steward to the Lord Chief Justice of the Queen&#x27;s Bench, Lord Denman. In 1846 he again became Lord Chancellor in Lord John Russell&#x27;s administration. His health, however, was failing and he resigned in 1850.

Shortly before retirement, he was created Viscount Crowhurst, of Crowhurst in the County of Surrey, and Earl of Cottenham, of Cottenham in the County of Cambridge. He lived at Prospect Place, Wimbledon in 1831–1851. He had succeeded his elder brother as third Baronet in 1845, and in 1849 his cousin as fourth Baronet of Juniper Hill.

==Family==
Lord Cottenham married Caroline Elizabeth, daughter of William Wingfield-Baker, in 1821 and had five sons and three daughters. He died at Pietra Santa, Lucca in the Italian Grand Duchy of Tuscany in April 1851, aged 70, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles, who was at the time Clerk of the Crown in Chancery. Lady Cottenham died in April 1868, aged 66 at The Cedars in Sunninghill, Berkshire.

Cottenham&#x27;s niece Emily Pepys (1833–1887), daughter of Henry Pepys, Bishop of Worcester, was a child diarist. Her work was not rediscovered and published until 1984.

<text>William Warner Sleator III (February 13, 1945 – August 3, 2011), known as William Sleator, was an American science fiction author who wrote primarily young adult novels but also wrote for younger readers. His books typically deal with adolescents coming across a peculiar phenomenon related to an element of theoretical science, then trying to deal with the situation. The theme of family relationships, especially between siblings, is frequently intertwined with the science fiction plotline.

Due to the suspenseful and often eerie nature of some of his works, Sleator has been compared to young-adult horror writer R. L. Stine (who has identified himself as a fan of Sleator&#x27;s work). Others cite a strong resemblance to the paranoid, dream-like style of Franz Kafka, which is most notable in &quot;House of Stairs&quot;, one of Sleator&#x27;s more popular novels.

==Biography==

===Early life, family and education===
Sleator, the oldest of four siblings, was born in Havre de Grace, Maryland, to William Warner Sleator, Jr., a professor of physiology and biophysics, and Esther Kaplan Sleator, a pediatrician who did pioneering research on attention deficit disorder (ADD). The Sleator family moved to University City, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis, when Billy (as the family called him) was three. His younger siblings are Vicky Wald, Tycho (Associate Professor of Physics at NYU), and Daniel (Professor of Computer Science at CMU). He attended University City High School, where he was known as a composer who wrote scores for school plays and the orchestra. He graduated in 1963.

He graduated from Harvard University with a degree in English in 1967.

===Career===
After college, Sleator moved to England, earning money by playing music in ballet schools. Eventually, Sleator returned to the United States to write his first novel, &quot;Blackbriar&quot;, eventually published in 1972, which was based on real life experiences. His first published book was a children&#x27;s story called &quot;The Angry Moon&quot;, released in 1970. It won a Caldecott Honor citation.

Sleator&#x27;s writing style has been described as clean and simple. His characters are reluctant teenage heroes, and Sleator&#x27;s younger siblings and friends have often found themselves being written into his prose, as in the semi-autobiographical story collection &quot;Oddballs&quot;.

Unlike the &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; science fiction future-oriented model (one of Buck Rogers tomorrowlands), Sleator&#x27;s work often includes a morbid or negative fixation on the past or includes visions of dystopian or alternate worlds (future or otherwise) in which something has gone wrong. For example, Sleator&#x27;s &quot;The Green Futures of Tycho&quot; takes place in the past in addition to the future; the world outside his &quot;House of Stairs&quot; is hinted to be dystopic; &quot;Interstellar Pig&quot; draws upon the supposed insanity of a long-dead prisoner.

Elements of Thai culture also occasionally turn up in his stories. His 2009 short story &quot;Fingernail&quot; appears in the anthology &quot;How Beautiful the Ordinary: Twelve Stories of Identity&quot; and is from a young gay Thai man&#x27;s perspective.

===Personal life===
Sleator struggled with alcoholism.

He split his time between homes in Boston, Massachusetts, and a small village in rural Thailand. His partner Paul Peter Rhode died in 1999, and his companion Siang Chitsa-Ard died in 2008. Sleator himself died on August 3, 2011, in Bua Chet, Thailand.

<text>Gostynin is a town in central Poland with 19,414 inhabitants (2004). It is the capital of Gostynin County in the Masovian Voivodship.

==History==

Gostynin has a long and rich history, which dates back to the early Middle Ages. In the 6th century, a Slavic gord existed north of contemporary town, on a hill located on the left bank of the Skrwa Lewa river, along a merchant trail. In the 12th century, the settlement found itself near the border between the provinces of Mazovia and Kuyavia.

In c. 1240, Gostynin was expanded by Duke Konrad I of Masovia, and in the 1280s, Duke Boleslaw II and Duke Konrad II fought over control of the settlement. As a result, in 1286 it was burned by Konrad II. Quickly rebuilt, in 1300 Gostynin was besieged but not captured by forces of Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. In c. 1326, the gord was besieged by Władysław I the Elbow-high, who wanted to control the area of Płock, which was a Bohemian fief.

By the early 14th century, Gostynin emerged as an important administrative center of Mazovia. In 1329, it became the seat of a castellan; first known castellan was a man named Pawel, mentioned in a 1345 document. In 1352, Siemowit III for the first time used the title “Duke of Gostynin”. It was probably during his reign that a defensive castle with a tower was built. At that time, a new settlement was established on the right bank of the Skrwa Lewa river, with a market square and a new parish church of St. Martin. In 1382, Duke Siemowit IV granted town charter to Gostynin, and as a result, ancient gord, located on the left bank of the river declined. Siemowit IV expanded the castle, making it his favorite residence. Władysław II Jagiełło visited Gostynin twice (1414, 1419). Siemowit IV died here in 1426, and after his death, the complex was rebuilt, with a wooden chapel added to it in 1439.

After childless deaths of two last dukes of Płock (Siemowit VI) and Władysław II of Płock, in 1462 Gostynin’s residents welcomed King Casimir IV Jagiellon, who confirmed all town’s privileges, and attached it to the Kingdom of Poland. From 1462 until 1793, Gostynin was part of Rawa Voivodeship, in which it was the seat of both a Land, and a county. Gostynin continued to prosper - in the period known as the Polish Golden Age, it had 265 houses, inn, mills and a brewery (as for 1564). In 1612, Russian Tsar Vasili IV died at the Gostynin castle, in which he had been kept with two brothers since 1611.

The period prosperity ended during the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–1660), after which only 20 houses were left in the whole town. Gostynin never recovered: it was burned by Russians in 1772, during Bar Confederation, and in 1777, the number of houses was only 43. By 1797, Gostynin had 89 houses, three churches, inn, brewery, three mills, sawmill and a wooden town hall

In 1793, following the second partition of Poland, Gostynin was captured by Prussian army. The castle, which had for long time been neglected, was pulled down, and its archive was seized by the occupiers. In 1807–1815, Gostynin belonged to the Duchy of Warsaw; in 1809, most of the town burned in a great fire. In 1824, the government of Russian-controlled Congress Poland invited to Gostynin 124 German cloth makers, who came with their families. The town began the process of recovery: St. Martin church, town hall and inn were rebuilt, and ruins of the castle were turned into a Protestant church. On January 28, 1863, the sixth day of the January Uprising, a Polish insurgent unit liberated a transport of Poles forcibly conscripted into the Russian army. During the uprising, a rebel unit of Emeryk Syrewicz operated in the area of Gostynin. In 1918, Poland regained independence and control of the town. The town had a significant Jewish minority, which in the Second Polish Republic numbered some 2,000, out of total population of 12,000. In 1924-25, Gostynin received rail connection with Płock and Kutno, thanks to a newly built line.

During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the Wehrmacht captured the town on 16 September 1939, and by late September, the town was directly annexed to the Third Reich. Its name was first changed into &quot;Gasten&quot;, and from June 1941 until the end of German occupation it was called &quot;Walrode&quot;. In October–November 1939, the Germans carried out mass arrests of local prominent Poles, as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; and then massacred 22 prisoners in the nearby forest of Wola Łącka on 1 December 1939. Among the victims were local mayor Michał Jarmoliński, member of Polish parliament Andrzej Czapski, chiefs of the local police and fire department, local teachers and priests. In February 1940, the Germans carried out a massacre of 40 Poles in the nearby forest. From 1940 to 1944 the local Polish population was subjected to expulsions. German authorities opened here a Jewish ghetto, most of whose residents were murdered in the Chełmno extermination camp. Germans retreated from Gostynin on 18 January 1945. As a result of the war 15% of the town was destroyed.

In 1946, a transit camp for Polish orphans repatriated from the Soviet Union was established in the town.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Płock Voivodship.

==Cuisine==

The officially protected distinctive traditional dish of the town and its surroundings is Gostynin fried mushrooms (&quot;grzyby smażone gostynińskie&quot;), as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland.

<text>Kutno is a city located in central Poland with 42,704 inhabitants (2021) and an area of . It is the capital of Kutno County in the Łódź Voivodeship.

During the invasion of Poland in 1939, Polish armies under General Tadeusz Kutrzeba conducted an offensive in and around Kutno, that was later named the Battle of the Bzura.

Based on its central location and the intersection of multiple rail lines, Kutno is an important railroad junction in Poland. Two main lines cross there (Łódź – Toruń and Warsaw – Poznań – Berlin). Another connection also starts in Kutno, which connects the town to Płock.

==Geographical position==
Kutno is located in the northern part of the Łódź Voivodeship and is to the northwest of the geographical center of Poland.

According to the data from 1 January 2009, the area of the town amounts to .

According to the physical–geographic division of Poland, the town is placed on the western edge of Kutno plain, which is the part of Middle–Masovia macro region. At the south of Kutno plain, Kutno straddles the boundary of the Łowicko – Błońska plain, which belongs to the same region and the Kłodawa Upland plain, which spreads in the west and is counted in the southern Greater Poland. To the north of the Przedecz – Gostynin line Kujawskie lakeland begins, which is included in the Greater Poland lakeland.

Kutno is located on the edge of four historical lands. Greater Poland, Kuyavia, Masovia, and Łęczyca. It is located in what is virtually the center of Poland, at a point where geographical and historical borders, as well as in the crossing of communication lines, are of major importance to the development of the city.

=== Administrative divisions ===
Kutno has maintained the administrative units of a town (Districts, housing developments), although certain parts of the town are simply called housing developments (e.g.: Łąkoszyn housing development). These divisions are mostly historical references. For instance, the Łąkoszyn housing development is part of what remains of the town of Łąkoszyn town which was incorporated to Kutno.

The following parts of Kutno have been formulated in the National Register of Country&#x27;s Administrative Division: Antoniew, Azory, Bielawki, Dybów, Kościuszków, Kotliska Małe, Łąkoszyn, Puśniki, Sklęczki, Stara Wieś, Stodółki, Walentynów, Wiktoryn, Żwirownia.

==Natural environment==

===Climate===
The climate of Kutno is similar to that of the entire lowland region of Poland. The temperature is influenced by continental and oceanic airflow patterns. Kutno is in the lowest zone of precipitation in Poland. It averages per year, but this can be significantly lower in some years. This is a problem for Kutno, exacerbated by low forest cover and intensive agriculture in the area. Kutno has about five storms during the year (about half of the national average). Snow falls, on average, 39 days in a year. There are about 21 foggy days during the year in the municipal area. But near the Ochnia river fog occurs quite often. On average there are 50 sunny and 130 cloudy days every year. The wind comes mostly from the west, veering southwest in winter and northwest in summer.

==History==

===Early history===
There are indications that the origin of the town may have taken place in the 12th century. The first mention of it was found in a document concerning an endowment of Łęczyca prepositure published due to a consecration of the collegiate church in Łęczyca in the year 1161.

According to the local folklore, both the town and the parish came into being in 1250, although official documentation to that effect is lacking. Most probably, the town began to be settled some time between the 12th and the 14th centuries; its name appeared for the first time in a document from the year 1301. The document had been published for his son Ziemysław by Leszek, Przemysł, and Kazimierz – duke of Kuyavia in the presence of three estate dignitaries as well as other people gathered during a convention in Włocławek. References to Kutno concern the appearance of rector Michał from the church in Kutno on the list of witnesses. In 1386, Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia had given to Andrzej de Kutno the privilege of freeing Kutno and Sieciechów villages from all charges and burdens excluding two coins (grosz) out of every crop fee. The role of the provincial courts was transferred to the Duke. In 1386, the village of Kutno was given trade and town rights, and 46 years later, in 1432 a municipal town charter. The first records that define Kutno as a town appeared in 1444.

Kutno was historically famous for its rose fair which after 1989 changed its name into The Festival of Roses/The Rose Festival.

=== 1500–1938 ===
1 July 1504: Mikołaj of Kutno gained the right to hold the St. Wawrzyniec fair, improving the development of the town&#x27;s trade. In 1701, the Kucieński family gave up Kutno to Anna Zamojska. The Zamoyski family fought amongst themselves for the property for a long time. The town fell into debt but the situation had normalized when Andrzej Hieronim Zamoyski became the owner of Kutno. During that time Kutno was a town of prosperity and development. A route connecting Warsaw with Poznań and Dresden ran through the town in the 18th century and King Augustus III of Poland often traveled that route. The town&#x27;s prestige increased after King Augustus III of Poland ordered the construction of the Postal Palace and consequently, the Saxon Palace was built. It was constructed between 1750 and 1753, after a royal track leading from Dresden to Warsaw had been built. The palace was decorated with rich interiors according to John M Walter&#x27;s plans. In 1753, Kutno was completely burned, resulting in the loss of the town records along with the settlement grant. After the fire, the King&#x27;s Lord Councillor Andrzej Zamoyski left Kutno in order to obtain another settlement grant, however, the town suffered another fire due to one of many army march-passes in 1774 and easygoing attitude of soldiers.

In 1775, Andrzej Zamoyski sold Kutno to Stanisław Kostka Gadomski – governor of Łęczyca province. Under his reign, Kutno became one of the biggest settlements in central Poland. The Second Partition of Poland occurred in 1793. Kutno had been completely under Prussian control and became part of the newly created province of South Prussia. The whole province of Kutno became part of the Łęczyca department, then after the Third Partition, it became part of the Warsaw department.

On 4 January 1807, Napoleon Bonaparte passed through Kutno. In 1807, under the Treaties of Tilsit, Kutno became part of the Duchy of Warsaw. An 1808 fire, most likely set by Napoleon&#x27;s army, destroyed 180 houses. In 1809 Kutno was visited by Jan Henryk Dąbrowski. After 1815, the area was incorporated into the Congress Kingdom of Poland. In 1826, the first town map was published due to the planned rebuilding of the town. In 1826, Fryderyk Chopin travelled through the town.

In 1840, a chapel was built which later became the Museum of the Battle of the Bzura river. Built in the Neo-Renaissance style and rotunda shape and crowned with a dome, it is part of the Wiosny Ludów park. It formerly served as a mausoleum for the Rzątkowski and Mniewski families. Another fire destroyed nearly all of the houses on Królewska St. Only two buildings remained – nowadays Crocantino and MDM. In 1844, the first hospital in Kutno was opened, sponsored by Kutno&#x27;s former owner Feliks Mniewski. A City Hall was built in 1845 in classicistic style. The building, located in the Marshal Piłsudski square, currently serves as the Regional Museum, in which one can see mementos and records from the history of Kutno.

In 1862, the Warsaw – Bydgoszcz railway line opened, leading Kutno to become an important railway junction and a trade and industry center. Directly before and during the period of the January Uprising, Kutno was the seat of the head of the Gostynin province. During the January Uprising, clashes between Polish insurgents and Russian troops took place in Kutno on 1–2 July and 8 August 1863.

In 1867, Kutno district was formed. This state endured until World War I outbreak. In 1886, on the place of the former Gothic church, the St. Lawrence Church (designed in a neo-Gothic style by Konstantyn Wojciechowski) was built.

On 5 January 1904, the Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz, a Nobel prize laureate, stayed in the Town Theatre, which was the seat of the Fire Brigade at that time. Income from his lecture was given to the poor children of Kutno. After his speech, a ball was held, to which only men were allowed, while women could watch it only from open windows.

The famous Jewish writer(Polish Jews) Szalom Asz was born in Kutno in 1880. In his collection of short stories &quot;Miasteczko&quot; (&quot;The Town&quot;), he described the situation of Jewish people from this town – Kutno. Every two years, the town holds the Szalom Asz Festival, which includes a literary contest about his works. In the 19th c. Kutno was a center of a sizeable Jewish community. In 1900, 10,356 Jews lived there.

From 15 to 16 October 1914, the Battle of Kutno took place between the Russian and the German. The Russians lost the battle, and the loss of Kutno provided the Germans with a direct access to Warsaw. In 1915, a local parish priest Franciszek Pruski was executed by a firing squad. A plaque commemoratinf this event has been placed in the St. John the Baptist church.

Many Kutno inhabitants took part in the Polish-Bolshevik War. They also fought in the Siberian Division. After the war, hundreds of 15-year-old boys enlisted in the Army Mining Corps, today known as the miner–soldiers.

From April 1919 to January 1921, a future French president Charles de Gaulle stayed in Kutno, as an instructor with the French military mission under general Louis Faury. On 5 March 1938, Kutno received its blazon, which depicts two rampant wild boars on the yellow background, leaning against a green bulrush.

===World War II===
The Battle of the Bzura river took place from 9 to 12 September 1939 during the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II. On 9 September the Poznań Army (&quot;Armia Poznań&quot;) operational group, led by General Edmund Knoll-Kownacki, attacked the German 8th Army led by General Johannes Blaskowitz. On 11 September Poland&#x27;s Pomorze Army reinforced the Polish troops in battle. At first, the Polish assault was successful but the Germans reinforced their troops on 12 September and started to counterattack. General Tadeusz Kutrzeba ordered Knoll to retreat beyond the Bzura river. Kutno remained outside the battle area. Despite the ultimate defeat of Polish army, the Battle of the Bzura river made the Germans change their strategy and regroup and also delayed the capitulation of Warsaw.

On 16 September 1939, the German Wehrmacht moved into Kutno, bombarding trains, the railway station, and houses throughout the district. At the junction of what is now Kochanowski Street and Maja Street, a German saboteur laid down a target for the bombers bombing the railway station.

The area was annexed directly to Germany, and administratively became part of the Third Reich&#x27;s Reichsgau Wartheland, within the district/county (&quot;kreis&quot;) of Kutno. In December 1939 expulsions began in accordance with Nazi Germany&#x27;s racial and ethnic policies, which aimed to make the town population purely German. People were forced to leave their houses early in the morning with only an hour&#x27;s notice and could take only of baggage and a small amount of money. Expulsion was very often carried out with violence. People were transported by trucks or wagons and then in sealed trains. The trip was up to eight days long, in terrible conditions. Poles from Kutno were also among the victims of a massacre carried out by the German police in February 1940 near Gostynin (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). On 14 April 1940, during the &quot;AB-Aktion&quot;, most of the Polish teachers from the Kutno district were arrested. Only a few survived having had left their houses earlier or having been prewarned. At least 173 Poles from Kutno and the county were murdered by the Soviets in the Katyn massacre in April–May 1940 or died in Soviet camps.
Subsequently, the Germans created a ghetto in Kutno on 15 June 1940. The entire area of a former sugar factory (&quot;Hortensja&quot; or &quot;Konstancja&quot; according to various sources) was surrounded by barbed wire. On the first day, the Poles were forbidden to leave their houses, while the Jews were forced to take all their belongings and proceed to the factory. The German soldiers and SS members beat the Jews standing in the street. Eight thousand people were transferred to the area of the factory, within five buildings. On the first day, crowded and without any first-aid facilities, a few people died. The only food they had was a small amount of potatoes and bread. Prices of extra food were very high. For instance, one kilogram of potatoes cost 40 Pfennig in the ghetto, while it was 5 Pfennig in the rest of the town. However, a true nightmare started in winter, when there was not enough firewood, so that the Jews had to burn furniture or scaffolding.

In the following year, 1941, due to overcrowding of resettled people and transport difficulties, a concentration camp was established at 7 Przemysłowa St. Due to terrible conditions in the camp, about 10 persons died of dysentery every day.

On 9 June 1941, at present-day Wolności Square, three Poles, Kalikst Perkowski, Wilhelm Czernecki and Piotr Sanda, were publicly executed in punishment for smuggling food to Warsaw. Their deaths were intended to be a lesson and the presence of locals at the execution was compulsory; even the families of the executed were there.

On 19 March 1942, the ghetto was closed. All Jews, in alphabetical order, were deported to Koło and then to the Chełmno extermination camp. The 6,000 Jewish inhabitants of Kutno were killed there, while elder people who had been ghetto administrators were killed in Kutno itself. Additionally, a forced labor camp operated in the area from January 1942 until January 1945. In 1943, 31 members of the Polish resistance were sentenced by the Germans in Dresden, 24 of them to death and executed there. On 19 January 1945, the Red Army arrived in Kutno, ending the German occupation, and the town was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which remained in power until the Fall of Communism in the end of the 1980s.

===1945–1989===
Cultural institutions resumed activity during first years after the liberation. Firstly, posts that had existed before 1939 were reopened. In June 1945 the Kutno District Public Library was opened. Thanks to donations by the public and the regaining of books that had been kept during the War, the library&#x27;s collection grew rapidly. The public library was and still is fulfilling its important role in broadening culture. Because of developed railway and road trails, Kutno has been attractive for investors. Among the many branches of industry in Kutno, the most important was the electronics industry. In 1957 Radio Components Company Miflex opened, and would eventually employ over three thousand people. The Company is one of the important distributors of capacitors, anti-interference filters. At the Marshal Piłsudski square Polish – Soviet brotherhood was constructed, depicting two persons: Red Army soldier and People&#x27;s Army of Poland soldier shaking hands with each other. After the monument had been constructed incidents such as vandalism and defacing it with paint by local high school students occurred. They were part of the group called &quot;Bloody Hawk&quot; (&quot;Krwawy Jastrząb&quot;).

In 1968 Kazimierz Jóźwiak, who was a choreographer and manager as well as director of the Kutno House of Culture founded the &quot;Song and Dance of Kutno`s Land Band&quot; (&quot;Zespół Pieśni i Tańca Ziemi Kutnowskiej&quot;). In 1971, the former Town Hall at the Marshal Piłsudski square Kutno Regional Museum was reopened. In 1975, the city was adjoined to the Płock Voivodeship and would remain so for the next 23 years. Annually, since September 1975, the Kutno Rose Festival takes place at the Kutno House of Culture, which has long been a center of cultural events in Kutno.
===After 1989===
In 1990 formula of the fair has been changed as well as its name: from The &quot;Rose Fair&quot; to &quot;The Rose Festival&quot;

In 1996 International Little League Baseball Tournament took place in Kutno. Since that time Kutno is the world-famous seat of the European Little League Baseball Center. On 18 August 1998 Higher School of Economics has been opened in Kutno in 7th Lelewel St. In 1999 because of an administrative resolution, Kutno district once again become part of the Łódź province after 24 years. In 2001, Królewska St. and Marshal Józef Piłsudski Square were renovated.

===Kutno Agro–Industrial Park (KAIP)===
As a result of decisions made in the 1970s, industry investments began being located in the eastern part of Kutno - Sklęczki - now Kutno Agro-Industrial Park. The decisive factor was access to the A2 motorway and the presence of a system of sidings connected with the E20 railway. KAIP began in 1996 during construction of the National Center for Food Processing and Distribution. Construction was led by the Urban Institute and the U.S. Agency for International Development and was opened in 1998.

==Legends==
According to a widespread story, Kutno was supposed to have been founded by Count Piotr from Kutna Hora, who had escaped in 997 with the brother of Bishop Wojciech from Bohemia to Poland. Kutno, the town, was founded as an heirloom of a family estate.

J. Łukawski, the publisher of Liber beneficiorum by J. Ławski, placed a footnote on page 478, with the following account: &quot;When Piotr of Kutno came to Poland in the year 997, he founded Kutno in memory of his manor house in the Bohemia. The parish church was founded along with the settlement. Piotr&#x27;s ancestors designated themselves as the Counts of Kutno and later assumed the name of Kucieńscy&quot;.

However, this story is not considered to be reliable and is rejected by most historians due to its doubtful origin. It is treated as an 18th-century legend or possibly a varnished version of the origins some &quot;noble&quot; families. The geographic dictionary of Polish Kingdom, commonly known as &quot;Kąty&quot;, gives the impression that Kutno could have been named &quot;Kątno&quot; originally.

The source of this legend is likely because of the similarities between names Kutno and Kutná Hora. First references to Kutná Hora were made in 1289, whereas about Kutno itself was not noted until 1301. In addition, in the 10th century Poles were not founding towns, as an equivalent. Instead, they had strongholds which were changed in the 13th century. The title of Count being used in Bohemia since 1627.

<text>The S-25 &quot;Berkut&quot; (; &quot;Berkut&quot; means golden eagle in English) is a surface-to-air guided missile, the first operational SAM system in the Soviet Union. In the early 1950s it was tested at Kapustin Yar. It was deployed in several rings around Moscow starting in 1955 and became combat ready in June 1956. The system failed, however, to detect, track, and intercept the only overflight of the Soviet capital Moscow by a U-2 reconnaissance plane on July 5, 1956. It was used only defensively at Moscow; the more mobile S-75 (SA-2 Guideline) would be used in almost all other locations. Several improvements were introduced over its long service lifetime, and the system was finally replaced by the S-300P in 1982.

Its NATO reporting name is SA-1 &quot;Guild&quot;. S-25 is short for &quot;Systema 25&quot;, referring to the entire system of missiles, radars, and launchers. Portions of the system include the V-300 missile, R-113 and B-200 radars, and A-11/A-12 antennas for the B-200.

Development of the S-25 was authorized on 9 August 1950 by a decision of USSR and was appended by Stalin: (&quot;We have to get the missile for air defense in a year&quot;). The system was assigned to design to SB-1 (Special Bureau No. 1).

The initial design included:
* E\F band A-100 &quot;Kama&quot; radar based in two concentric rings; a near ring - from Moscow, and a far ring, approximately from Moscow, for early warning and target detection.
*B-200 missile targeting radars, deployed in two rings.
*V-300 SAMs deployed around the B-200 radars.
*G-400 Interceptor aircraft. These were Tu-4 with G-300 (&quot;izdelie 210&quot;, downsized version of V-300 with aerial launch) missiles.
*&quot;Possibly&quot;, Tu-4 based AWACS aircraft D-500.

The implementation was assigned to the Third Main Agency, which was specially created, by the Soviet of Ministers of the USSR. SB-1 was converted to KB-1 (Design Bureau No.1) headed by P.N. Kuksenko and S.L. Beria. Some captured German specialists were concentrated in department No.38 of KB-1.

Test range trials of the first experimental system were conducted in January 1952. These tests led to the removal of the air based components of the Berkut system (G-400/G-300 and G-500).

The construction of ground infrastructure (designed by the Moscow division of Lengiprostroy, V.I. Rechkin) was done from 1953 through 1955 at ranges from Moscow. There were about of roads built by prisoners.

After the death of Stalin and arrest of L.P. Beria (the head of Soviet police and security, and the father of S.L. Beria) in June 1953, the KB-1 was reorganized and headed by Raspletin. The Third Main Agency was converted to Glavspetsmash and included into the Ministry of Medium Machine Building. The name Berkut was changed to Systema 25.

The first combat elements of S-25 were delivered to the military in 1954. In March 1954 most sites were being prepared for the installation of the missiles and launchers. The final tests were completed in the beginning of 1955. The first batteries entered service on 7 May 1955. The system entered combat duty in June 1956. The launchers were located at a distance of from Moscow, a dense ring (at a distance of from each other). The locations were masked by forests.

After the system have entered service some parts of Glavspetsmash (Glavspetsmontazh and Glavspetsmash) were disbanded, the KB-1 was transferred to the Ministry of Defense Industries.

In order to operate the S-25 system, the &quot;Separate Army for Special Purposes&quot; was established under the command of general-colonel K. Kazakov in the spring of 1955, being part of Soviet Air Defense Forces (&quot;PVO Strany&quot;).

A number of improvements was made to the initial S-25 design during the service. The latest modernized S-25M was retired and replaced with S-300P air defense complexes in 1982. Most sites of the original S-25 complex were dismantled in the 1990s and are now summer cottage developments for Moscow residents.

==Surface-to-air Missile Complex S-25==
The parts of the S-25 were designed in parallel. Some grounds were created at the Kapustin Yar test range to support the development of S-25:
*№30 - technical position to prepare missiles
*№31 - living rooms of servicemen
*№32 - V-300 launcher
*№33 - B-200 radar

The first tests of S-25 in full control mode were started 2 November 1952 (using radar-simulated target). The tests against parachute targets were done in the beginning of 1953. Tu-4 drones were used for moving target tests from 26 April to 18 May 1953. There were 81 launches during trials from 18 September 1952 to 18 May 1953. Additional tests were done in September–October 1953 against Il-28 and Tu-4 drones.

The decision of the government to build a full scale S-25 complex at the Kapustin Yar was made in January 1954. The complex was sampled for the state trials on 25 June 1954. The trials were conducted from 1 October 1954 to 1 April 1955 and included 69 launches at Il-28 and Tu-4 drones (including simultaneous launch of 20 missiles at 20 targets).
The complex was capable of firing at 20 targets with 1 or 2 missiles simultaneously, having up to 60 missiles ready to launch. The startup time was 5 minutes (for 18 target channels).

There were 56 S-25 series-built complexes manufactured and deployed around the Moscow area, plus one series-built and one experimental deployed at the Kapustin Yar test range.

===B-200 Missile Targeting Radar===
Each site was equipped with a B-200 guidance system, including a track while scan radar (designated &quot;Yo-Yo&quot; by US intelligence). The radar operated at the frequency 3 GHz and its two fan (1°x60°) beams independently scanned the defended sector in elevation and azimuth. The system also incorporated fire-control system equipment which enabled each site to engage as many as 10 targets simultaneously, each with two missiles.

The B-200 radar prototype was tested in the middle of 1950.

===Surface-to-air Missile V-300===
The first V-300 missile was fired 25 July 1951 at the Kapustin Yar test range.

The missile, which went by a variety of names depending on the version, used a single liquid-propellant rocket motor. Although its maximum speed was on the order of Mach 2.5, it had a low initial velocity which limited its engagement capability against supersonic targets. Its maximum intercept range varied depending upon the approach and type of target; against a directly incoming, high-flying B-52 its range was on the order of . The missile carried a large warhead of , and its lethal radius was estimated to be . It was believed to be capable of interceptions from a minimum altitude of up to , with some additional capability up to about , particularly if equipped with a nuclear warhead.

By 1959, a total of about 32,000 V-300 missiles had been manufactured.

==Operators==
===Current operators===
* − Currently used as targets for training SAM systems. Strizh target-missile (system S-25M) in service as of 2011. Firing more than 11,000 missiles.

===Former operators===
* − Retired in 1982, but passed on to Russia and reused for training purposes.

<text>The City of Kawartha Lakes (2021 population 79,247) is a single-tier municipality in Central Ontario, Canada. Though structured as a single-tier municipality, Kawartha Lakes is the size of a typical Ontario county and is mostly rural. It is the second largest single-tier municipality in Ontario by land area (after Greater Sudbury).

The main population centres are the communities of Lindsay (population: 22,367), Bobcaygeon (population: 3,576), Fenelon Falls (population: 2,490), Omemee (population: 1,060) and Woodville (population: 718).

==History==
The Kawartha Lakes area is situated on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, Huron-Wendat and more recently, the Haudenosaunee peoples. The city&#x27;s name is from the Kawartha Lakes. &quot;Kawartha&quot; is an anglicization of &quot;Ka-wa-tha&quot; (from &quot;Ka-wa-tae-gum-maug&quot; or &quot;Gaa-waategamaag&quot;), which was coined in 1895 by Martha Whetung of the Curve Lake First Nations. It meant &quot;land of reflections&quot; in the Anishinaabe language, according to Whetung. The word was later changed by tourism promoters to &quot;Kawartha&quot;, meaning &quot;bright waters and happy lands.&quot;

Prior to its restructuring as a city, the area was known as Victoria County. The city was created in 2001, during the ruling provincial Progressive Conservative party&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot;. Through provincial legislation, the former Victoria County and its constituent municipalities were amalgamated into one entity named the &quot;City of Kawartha Lakes&quot;.

This act was implemented by the Victoria County Restructuring Commission, led by commissioner Harry Kitchen. Despite a general opposition from residents of the area, the provincial government pushed forward with the amalgamation, which officially came into effect on January 1, 2001.

By a narrow margin (51% for, 49% against), the citizens of Kawartha Lakes voted to de-amalgamate in a November 2003 local plebiscite, but the provincial and municipal governments have not taken any steps since the vote to initiate de-amalgamation.

==Demographics==

==Victoria County==

Prior to 2001, Victoria County consisted of 13 separate townships and 6 incorporated communities, each with their own local governments:

===Townships===

Incorporated Township Name (Population centres):
*Bexley (Victoria Road, Coboconk)
*Carden (Dalrymple)
*Dalton (Sebright, Uphill, Sadowa)
*Eldon (Glenarm, Kirkfield, Woodville)
*Emily (Omemee, Downeyville, Fowlers Corners)

*Somerville (Coboconk, Kinmount)
*Verulam (Dunsford, Bobcaygeon)

The township of Laxton, Digby and Longford is an amalgamation of the once individual townships of Digby and Laxton, and half of the original Longford Township. The separate township of Longford is uninhabited, though dotted with abandoned logging towns. In 2000, just prior to amalgamation into the city of Kawartha Lakes, the township of Verulam and the village of Bobcaygeon were amalgamated into the Municipality of Bobcaygeon/Verulam, and the separate townships of Carden and Dalton amalgamated into the Township of Carden/Dalton.

<text>Wali Khan Amin Shah () (also known as Osama Turkestani, Osama Azmurai, and Grabi Ibrahim Hahsen ) is a Saudi man who fought with the Afghan Arabs in Afghanistan, and called for the jihad movement to focus on attacking the United States. He had a role in the foiled Bojinka plot. He was convicted of terrorism and imprisoned on these charges from 1995 to 2021.

==Background==

Shah was born in Turkestan (now Uzbekistan), having fled with his family to escape the Soviet invasion and settled in Saudi Arabia where he was a stateless person. Shah says he was sent by the Saudi government to fight in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

==Attack on Philippines==

Shah bombed the Greenbelt Theatre in Manila on December 1, injuring several people. In January 1995, Shah traveled from Pakistan to Manila via Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to rendezvous with Ramzi Yousef.

==Capture and re-capture==

The Bojinka plot was discovered by police on January 6, 1995. He was arrested by Manila police at an apartment on Singalong Street, which Yousef had set up in case the plot failed, on January 11, but he escaped police custody roughly 77 hours later. After obtaining a fraudulent passport bearing the name &quot;Osama Turkestani&quot;, he lived on the nearby island of Langkawi until his December 1995 re-arrest in Malaysia. After the re-arrest, he was handed over to United States authorities. 

Khan&#x27;s capture was initially a closely guarded secret, but ABC News correspondent John Miller revealed the news of his arrest during a 1998 interview with Osama bin Laden at an al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan. FBI Special Agent John P. O&#x27;Neill was initially suspected of leaking the information to his friend Christopher Isham and was nearly indicted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, but ABC denied that O&#x27;Neill was the source of the information.

Shah was reported to have made an unsuccessful escape attempt from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.

Shah was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison having spent his first 14 years in solitary confinement under very severe conditions due to Special Administrative Measures (SAMs) in ADX Florence, and was later transferred to the Communication Management Unit (CMU) a little less severe in Marion, Illinois.

Shah cooperated with the United States Government since August 1998. Shah, Federal Bureau of Prisons # 42799-054, previously incarcerated at Marion USP, was held at FCI Terre Haute. He was released on September 3, 2021. Since he is a stateless person, Shah will likely remain detained throughout lengthy deportation proceedings, although after six months of detention, the burden shifts to the US government to prove that his removal is possible in the reasonably foreseeable future.

<text>Wągrowiec () is a town in west-central Poland, from both Poznań and Bydgoszcz. Since the 18th century it has been the seat of a powiat. Administratively it is attached to the Greater Poland Voivodeship. The town is situated in the middle of the ethnographic and historical region of Pałuki within Greater Poland and the Chodzież lake area (), on the river Wełna and its tributaries Nielba and Struga, as well as on the shores of Durów Lake.

==Geography==
The region around the town is rich in lakes. The town itself sits in the middle of Lake Durowskie (). The Wągrowiec municipal area boasts a rare attraction: two rivers, the Nielba and Wełna cross there, without commingling.

==Administration==
Wągrowiec is constituted as a &quot;gmina miejska&quot;, or municipal commune. The city is also the seat of the rural commune of Wągrowiec, as well as of powiat of Wągrowiec.

Situated in the Greater Poland Voivodeship since 1999, Wągrowiec was previously a part of the Pila Voivodeship (1975–1998).

==Economy==
Wągrowiec is an important rail and road junction. There are several notable industries in the town, including the machinery factories (a branch of the Hipolit Cegielski factory in Poznań and a branch of the Zremb machinery factory), major food processing plants (a mill, meat canning factory and a milk yard) and a furniture factory. The town is also a centre of tourism, with several hotels along the shores of the lake.

==History==

The town was founded as a small village called Prostynie by the Cistercian monks from the monastery in Łekno in 1319. In 1381 the name of Wągrowiec is mentioned for the first time in connection with the place. By that time the town received city rights, most likely modelled after the Magdeburg Law. It was a private church town, administratively located in the Kcynia County in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. At the end of the 14th century, King Władysław II Jagiello gave the city the privileges of market and fair, and in 1396 the Cistercian monastery was moved in.

The town soon started to prosper. In the 15th and 16th centuries it was an important centre of trade, commerce, and manufacture (mostly textiles). In the 16th century, the Cistercians founded a school in Wągrowiec. This prosperity came to a halt during the Deluge, when in 1656 the town was captured, pillaged and burnt by the forces of Charles X of Sweden.
After the Second Partition of Poland, Wągrowiec in 1793 was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and was confiscated from the Cistercians in 1797. Initially a part of the newly created province of South Prussia, it was in 1807 transferred to the Duchy of Warsaw, a state allied to the Napoleonic France. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat and the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Wągrowiec was again annexed by Prussia; this time it was made a part of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Poznań.

The populace was subjected to anti-Polish policies, including Germanisation. In 1835 the Cistercian monastic order was dissolved, and its property was confiscated by the Prussian authorities. In the 1830s, the &quot;Marianie&quot; secret resistance organization of Polish gymnasium students was formed in the town. On February 9, 1849, the autonomy of the Duchy was cancelled, and Wągrowiec — under the Germanized name of &quot;Wongrowitz&quot;—became part of the Province of Posen. In 1888 a railroad line linking Wągrowiec with Poznań was opened. In 1906–1907, local Polish school children protested against Germanisation, and the protests spread to nearby villages. German teachers used corporal punishment for the protests, especially flogging, and older students were expelled from the gymnasium.

After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence and Wągrowiec became the first town of northern Greater Poland to be liberated by the Poles during the Greater Poland Uprising. Polish inhabitants of Wągrowiec formed an insurgent unit, led by Włodzimierz Kowalski, a teacher from the nearby village of Czerlin, which fought in various battles in northern Greater Poland in 1919. The town was reintegrated with the Republic of Poland, and the local populace had to acquire Polish citizenship or leave the country. This led to a significant decline of ethnic Germans, whose number within the district decreased from 16,309 in 1910 to 8,401 in 1926 and further to 7,143 in 1934.
Following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the end of the invasion of Poland, which started World War II in 1939, the town was annexed by Nazi Germany. Already on September 7, 1939, German troops carried out a massacre of eight Poles in Wągrowiec. During the German occupation, Wągrowiec was part of the German Reichsgau Wartheland and its name was changed by the Nazis to &quot;Eichenbrück&quot;. Germany operated a Nazi prison in the town. Poles from various settlements of the region were imprisoned in the town, and afterwards, on December 8, 1939, the Germans carried out a massacre of 107 Poles, including activists, participants of the uprising of 1918-1919, teachers, students, farmers, merchants, in the forest near Bukowiec, north of Wągrowiec. Many Polish inhabitants were expelled to the more easterly areas of German-occupied Poland (General Government) as part of the implementation of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policies. In August 1944, the Germans carried out mass arrests of local members of the Home Army, the leading Polish underground resistance organization. Wągrowiec was liberated in January 1945 and the expelled Polish inhabitants returned. Polish schooling resumed in February 1945.

<text>Wałcz ( ; ) is a county town in Wałcz County of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship in northwestern Poland.

Granted city rights in 1303, Wałcz has become the administrative, industrial and cultural center of the Wałcz Lake District with the city itself situated on the banks of the Raduń and Zamkowe lakes. Wałcz is located in the southestern portion of West Pomeranian Voivodeship. The closest cities are Szczecin , Bydgoszcz , Piła , Poznań , Gorzów Wielkopolski and Koszalin .

Historically, the town belonged to the province of Greater Poland and was a royal city of Poland until the Partitions of Poland. Afterwards, from 1772 to 1945 it was part of Prussia and, from 1871 to 1945, it was also part of Germany, before being reintegrated with Poland. It is the location of one of the oldest high schools in Poland, founded over 350 years ago, and a garrison of the Polish Army.

==Geography==

According to a report from 2002, Wałcz has an area of of which 41% is used for agriculture and 17% is forest.

There are two large lakes within the town limits: Raduń (area - , length - , shoreline - over , maximum depth - , average depth - ) and Zamkowe (area - , length - , shoreline - over , maximum depth - , average depth - ). There are also four smaller lakes within the town limits: Cegielnia, Chmiel Duży, Chmiel Mały, Raduń Mały, and several more within a short distance of Wałcz, including Ostrowiec Wielki, Łubianka, Łabędzie. Lake Raduń is spanned by the Kłosowski suspension bridge.

The town occupies 2.17% of the total area of Wałcz county.
==History==

In the High Middle Ages the region of modern Wałcz was a boundary territory between Pomerania and Greater Poland. It was included within the emerging Polish state in the late 10th century, and was integrated into the Kingdom of Poland again in the early 12th century. Later, as a result of the fragmentation of Poland, it became part of the Duchy of Greater Poland. Except for a brief period of Brandenburg rule (in the 14th century), it remained part of Poland until the first partition in 1772. After the town was recovered by King Casimir III the Great in 1368, it was a royal town and county seat, administratively located in the Poznań Voivodeship of the Greater Poland Province. In 1618 Jan Gostomski, starost of Wałcz, brought the Jesuits to the town, who founded the Jesuit College, nicknamed the &quot;Wałcz Athens&quot;, in the 1660s, which as today&#x27;s &quot;I Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Kazimierza Wielkiego&quot;, is one of the oldest high schools in northwestern Poland.

During Prussian and German rule, Wałcz was known by the newly given name &quot;Deutsch Krone&quot;. It was initially part of the Netze District, which while formally separate was ruled from the Province of West Prussia after 1775; it formally became part of West Prussia following the 1807 Treaties of Tilsit which partitioned the Netze District. In 1781, the Jesuit College was transformed into a &quot;Royal Gymnasium&quot;, whose director was Józef Dalski. Lessons in Polish were held until 1831, when the school, similar to the town, was subjected to Germanisation. However, its director from 1866 to 1890 was a Pole, Antoni Łowiński. At that time, Polish lessons were restored as an optional, additional course for students, and a secret Polish youth philomath organization &quot;Ul&quot; operated in the school. Łowiński&#x27;s gravestone at the local cemetery is the only one facing away from the main cemetery alley, because the German administration opposed using Latin inscriptions, instead of German. In 1831–1832, one of the main escape routes for insurgents of the Polish November Uprising from partitioned Poland to the Great Emigration led through the town.

After the First World War it was one of the few towns of historical Greater Poland that were not included in the borders of Poland after regaining independence in 1918. Deutsch Krone, having a predominantly German population, remained part of Weimar Germany and was part of the Posen-West Prussia province until 1938 when it was assigned to Pomerania. During World War II, the Germans operated a labor camp for French and American prisoners of war from the Stalag II-B prisoner-of-war camp in the town. The Polish resistance conducted espionage of German activity in the town. The town was occupied by the Red Army on 12 February 1945. After the end of World War II, the town became again part of Poland according to the Potsdam Conference and renamed to its historic name &quot;Wałcz&quot;. Also in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement, its German inhabitants were expropriated and expelled. The town was repopulated by Poles, most of whom were themselves expelled from the former eastern territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.

Numerous pre-war ruins of German fortifications and bunkers are found in woods surrounding Wałcz, especially in proximity to the lakes. Most of them however are inaccessible – blown up or filled with soil, to prevent accidents with careless tourists.

From 1975 to 1998, the town was administratively part of the Piła Voivodeship.

The lack of heavy industry in Wałcz and the surrounding areas has helped the city to maintain relative ecological cleanliness and is an excellent location for rest and relaxation. It has a post office that was built during the reign of Napoleon.

==Sport==

Next to the suspension bridge on Lake Raduń in a beechwood forest is an Olympic Training Facility, the &#x27;Bukowina&#x27;. Immediately after World War II, Winand Osiński and Olympic coach Jan Mulak founded the training centre and began training with the Polish track and field teams who represented Poland during the 50s and 60s. Poland&#x27;s Olympic kayak team trains here to this day.

On this lake is also the City Centre for Sport and Recreation (MOSiR - Miejski Ośrodek Sportu i Rekreacji) which makes a wide range of sporting equipment available, including motor boats, kayaks, water bikes and the leisure boat &quot;Delfin&quot;. The centre also serves as a starting point for numerous walking and biking trails as well as kayak excursions. The so-called &quot;Pętla Wałecka&quot;, a kayaking route that traverses six lakes begins here and ends at Lake Bytyń Wielki.

Situated on the shores of the lakes are numerous beaches, swimming areas, camping spots and sporting equipment rentals.

<doc id="386801" wikidata="Q556200" url="?curid=386801" title="Piła">
<text>Piła (; ) is a city in northwestern Poland and the capital of Piła County, situated in the Greater Poland Voivodeship. Its population was 71,846, making it the city in the voivodeship after Poznań and Kalisz and the largest city in the northern part of Greater Poland.

Founded in the 14th century, Piła was a royal city of Poland, whose prosperity came from crafts and trade. The city is located on the Gwda river and is famous for its green areas, parks and dense forests nearby. It is an important road and railway hub, located at the intersection of two main lines: Poznań–Szczecin and Bydgoszcz–Krzyż Wielkopolski. Piła is the center of light industry, culture and education in northern Greater Poland, and is particularly known for motorcycle speedway racing.

==City name==
&quot;Piła&quot; is a Polish word meaning &quot;saw&quot;. This was a typical name denoting a village of woodcutters belonging to a local noble. The German name &quot;Schneidemühl&quot; means &quot;sawmill&quot;.

==History==
===In the Kingdom of Poland===
====Overview====
Piła traces its origins to an old fishing village. Following the German colonist movement of the 13th century, and particularly after the end of the first Mongol invasion of Poland of 1241, many German colonizers came to this densely wooded area of Poland. General immigration of German settlers diminished, however, when Poland, under King Casimir IV Jagiellon (1447–1492), finally defeated the Teutonic Order in 1466.

====Early history====
A Slavic settlement of woodcutters in the fishing village Piła may have existed before any of the later villages and surrounding towns of the area were established. Thus, in the 14th century Piła grew to some extent because of its position on the Gwda a mere from where it joins the river Notec. Yet, the settlement developed less than others that were on such major water routes as the rivers Warta or Vistula. Piła&#x27;s simple layout of unpaved streets and primitive clay and timber houses gave little protection to its inhabitants and was still far from becoming a commercially interesting locale. If one were to credit a Privilegium (charter) of the early 1380s as evidence, a document associated with the building of a church in Piła and ascribed to the very young Polish Queen Jadwiga of Poland—a copied document that still existed in the archives of the town before 1834—then that period could well be regarded as the time when the village of Piła/Snydemole was elevated to the status of town. The recurring double naming Piła-Snydemole may be because two originally separate localities took their name from the water-powered sawmill that had been part of the town&#x27;s raison d&#x27;être from the beginning.

Documented references to Snydemole and Piła are reportedly found in parish church sources of 1449, where there is mention of a sawmill and of the name of the current wojewoda (governor) Paul. Evidence also exists of a letter from 1456 by the Brandenburg Friedrich II Hohenzollern who had bought the Neumark region from the Teutonic Order in 1455. The letter is addressed to bishop Andrzej of Poznań and to Łukasz Górka, the local Starosta, the royal constable of Wielkopolska. The elector complained that in prevailing peace times some burghers of Snydemole and Piła were making raids on his lands. This accusation may tend to give additional credence to the earlier claim that Queen Jadwiga in the 1380s was indeed the founder of the town of Piła.

====City rights====

Until 1480 Piła was a town owned by the nobility, belonging to Maciej Opaliński who later presented his holdings to King Casimir IV Jagiellon, at which time Piła became a royal town. Administratively it was located in the Poznań County in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. It is known that ten years later the burghers of the town were accused and penalized for tax evasion that had been occurring over a period of five years. However, King Sigismund I the Old—during whose reign immigration of numerous Jews from the Iberian peninsula, Bohemia and German states was encouraged—bestowed municipal rights upon the town of Piła on 4 March 1513, a landmark decision. This was an important achievement for Piła since it gave the burghers not only status, but also the rights to self-administration and its own judiciary. The administration of the town&#x27;s affairs was now in the hands of three legislative bodies, elected from among the burghers. They were the council with the mayor, jury court and the elders of the guilds. Only the position of the Wójt remained in the hands of the crown or its deputy, the Starosta. The sovereign, however, remained the ultimate judge, warlord and owner of the land. Being free from the arbitrariness of a Castellan or of Wojewoda (governor of the province)—Piła&#x27;s town folk took advantage of the town&#x27;s privileges by owning property, carrying on any trade and enjoying the right to hold much needed market fairs.

====16th century====
Economic circumstances or personal feuds may have been responsible for the frequent changes of ownership of the town, as Piła was &#x27;purchased&#x27; in 1518 by Hieronymus von Bnin; the document outlining the deed and ownership during his lifetime was given to him by King Sigismund I in 1525. Following the demise of Bnin, the town became the property of the dynasty of the mighty Gorka family. This family, secretly leaning toward Protestantism and in power until the 17th century, included some of the wealthiest landowners and most influential nobles of Poland and was known to be benevolent to their town&#x27;s folk.

In 1548 Piła obtained a privilege that banned any foreign potter from the town&#x27;s markets, and in 1561 a fishing privilege was obtained. Piła was part of the Poznań Voivodeship, the region divided into the four &quot;starostwa&quot; (land holdings) of Poznań, Kościan, Wschowa and Wałcz, the latter encompassing the Starosty Ujscie-Piła, the area between the rivers Gwda, Notec and Drage. &quot;Stara&quot; Piła, the old Piła, a town that never had walls, was slow to grow.
By the middle of the 16th century, many German Protestant craftsmen and traders, driven out of Bohemia by religious persecution during the Reformation, settled in numerous towns in the region. Some may have settled in Piła too, yet in 1563 the small town had no more than 750 inhabitants. They are known to have lived in 153 houses, primitively built, primarily with timber and clay, covered with straw and grouped mainly around the Old Market. When King Stephen Báthory of Poland confirmed two of the town&#x27;s privileges on 3 September 1576, the burghers were granted the right to hold their weekly market on a Monday (instead of Thursday), an important feat. Over the following 150 years, numerous privileges and charters were re-issued by the Polish crown, mainly as a result of loss by fire. By 1591 a statute allowing apprenticeships in various trades was obtained. In 1593 King Sigismund III Vasa confirmed old privileges of Piła.

====17th century: Queen Constance reshaping the town====
When the widowed Sigismund III Vasa married princess Constance, an Austrian archduchess from the House of Habsburg, in 1605, he presented the town of Piła, together with the lands of the domain of Ujście, as a wedding gift to his new bride. She became responsible for changing Piła in several ways over the next few decades. Acting in concert with the tenets of the prevailing Catholic Counter Reformation, the queen first attended to what seemed closest to her heart. She saw to it that numerous Protestant churches in the region of Wałcz, the most German of areas where seventeen Protestant villages existed, be handed over to the Roman Catholic clergy, hounding many a German Protestant burgher in the process.

After one of the town&#x27;s frequent fires in 1619, the queen—in a benevolent gesture and as her &#x27;present&#x27; to the burghers of Piła—appropriated funds from the large estate to have the old burnt-out wooden Catholic Church rebuilt. Alas, given the random, close proximity of houses to one another, town fires occurred with such regularity in numerous communities during that period that in 1626 another devastating fire broke out in Piła. This time the entire town was laid to ashes, including the newly built church. Constance subsequently charged her secretary Samuel Targowski on 15 July 1626 to survey what was left of the town. His proposal for a new layout was to be drastic for Christian burghers; to the developing Jewish community it was most consequential and of particular detriment. Constance also decided on a distinct segregation of Jews and Christians. The Jewish community was to resettle in a ghetto, what was to become a virtual town within a town. The new site, from thereon often referred to as &quot;Judenstadt&quot;, the Jews&#x27; town. To demarcate the newly created ghetto, the decree called for a sizable trench to be dug to surround the Jewish quarters where feasible; otherwise a tall wooden fence had to serve to close in the area completely.
A new church arose in 1628. Unlike most other buildings in town, the choir room section of this edifice was to remain intact in its original form until 1945. New houses were constructed of brick and stone and the town was reconstructed in plain Renaissance style. Polish Kings confirmed old privileges of Piła again in 1633 and 1650, and granted new privileges in 1660, 1670 and 1688, which were then confirmed in 1716. On 24 July 1655, during the Deluge, Swedish troops captured the predominantly Lutheran town and destroyed most of its buildings and infrastructure. During October 1656, a Polish troupe of Stefan Czarniecki&#x27;s army sought retribution upon the largely German and Protestant burghers of Piła, accusing them of collusion with the Swedes. During the consecutive Great Northern and Seven Years&#x27; Wars similar havoc was visited upon the remaining inhabitants. To add to the plight, it was discovered that the plague had been carried in.

===In the Kingdom of Prussia and the Duchy of Warsaw===
With the signing of the definitive treaty to divide Poland between Prussia, Austria and Russia in 1772, the First Partition of Poland was accomplished. Piła became part of the Kingdom of Prussia and was officially renamed &quot;Schneidemühl&quot;. After Frederick II of Prussia signed the Ownership Protocol of his Polish lands on 13 September 1772, he created out of the northern parts of Greater Poland and Kuyavia the &quot;Département Westpreussen&quot;. Part of that area was later also known as the &quot;Netzedistrikt&quot;, a governmental administrative district consisting of a wide strip of land both sides of the river Noteć (Netze), stretching from it source north of Września (Wreschen) to the border of the Neumark. Frederick II initiated new German Protestant colonization in opposition to Polish Catholics.

In the year 1781, another huge fire occurred, which devastated half the town. Although Prussian authorities had brought in chimney sweeps and regulations that spelled out fire emergency tasks, hardly anyone in the town was prepared for a major conflagration. 44 houses, 37 stables and 17 barns burned down.

In 1793 Piła was recaptured for a short period by a Polish army led by Colonel Wyganowski. Following Prussia&#x27;s defeat in the battle of Jena and Greater Poland uprising (1806), and after signing the Peace of Tilsit of 7 July 1807, Piła became part of the semi-independent Polish Duchy of Warsaw.

===19th century: industrialization and railway hub===

After the Congress of Vienna of 1815, Prussia regained the town once again. Under the Prussian administrative reforms of 1816–18, the town became part of the Kolmar District within the Bromberg Region of the Grand Duchy of Posen. On 1 January 1818 Kreis Kolmar was established, with its seat in Piła / Schneidemühl, which in 1821 was moved to Chodzież. One of the main escape routes for insurgents of the unsuccessful Polish November Uprising from partitioned Poland to the Great Emigration led through the city.

The Polish language was restricted from offices and education and the city saw a significant influx of German settlers. By 1834 Schneidemühl had barely recovered from the worst outbreak of cholera of 1831, an epidemic that affected the town&#x27;s burghers to such an extent that a special Protestant cholera cemetery had to be laid out in the town&#x27;s suburb Berliner Vorstadt. In the summer of 1834 the city was again struck by a fire that destroyed a large part of the city centre and the city archives. The city was rebuilt shortly afterwards.

In 1851 the city was connected to Berlin and Bydgoszcz (Bromberg) by the Prussian Eastern Railway. An architectural artifact which remains from the railway development period is a historical roundhouse.

The Germanisation policy of the Prussian and Imperial German government replaced its Polish identity with a German one. By the end of the 19th century the city had become one of the most important railway centers of the region and one of the biggest towns in the Province of Posen. It was turned into a Prussian military garrison town. Schneidemühl was revisited by a catastrophe, known as the &quot;Brunnenunglück&quot;, or the &#x27;calamity of the well&#x27; that made national headlines. The drilling of an artesian well in August 1892 went horribly wrong and led to unexpected widespread flooding of many of the streets laid out in 1834, causing numerous houses to simply collapse and leaving more than eighty families without shelter. The worst was that this disaster came only a few years on the heels of unexpected flooding caused by the spring thaw of March 1888 that had turned the Küddow into a raging river, when many people were forced to use rowboats to navigate the streets.

====First World War and Imperial German military aviation technology====

On 1 April 1914 Schneidemühl was disentangled from the Kolmar District and became an independent city (or urban district; Stadtkreis) within the Bromberg Region. In the months before the outbreak of World War I, in April 1914 the Albatros Flugzeugwerke established the so-called &quot;Ostdeutsche Albatros-Werke&quot; (East German Albatros Works, abbreviated &quot;O.A.W.&quot;) in Schneidemühl for construction of military aircraft for the Fliegertruppe air service of the German Army throughout the war — it later undertook license production of Fokker&#x27;s famous Fokker D.VII fighter during the last year of World War I.

During the First World War, the Germans operated a prisoner-of-war camp in the city, initially taking mainly Russian POWs (including Poles and Latvians conscripted into the Russian Army) but later including prisoners from most Allied nations including Britain and Australia. A telling account of life in the town during that period survives in the form of the diary of Piete Kuhr, then a young girl whose grandmother worked at the Red Cross canteen at the railway station.

===As a provincial capital within the Weimar Republic===

After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence, and the Greater Poland Uprising broke out, which aim was to reintegrate the region with Poland. Local Poles were persecuted for their pro-Polish stance by the Germans, who also held Polish insurgents in the local prison. After the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, and after much protest by the German majority of its population, Schneidemühl was not included in the Polish Second Republic. After the Greater Poland Uprising, the new Polish-German border ran south of the city.
On 21 July 1922 Schneidemühl became the administrative centre of the new Frontier March of Posen-West Prussia Province, a body of self-rule encompassing those three disconnected parts of the former Province of Posen and the westernmost parts of the Province of West Prussia, which were not ceded to Poland and of the Posen-West Prussian Schneidemühl Region, a body of central government supervision comprising the same provincial area. In 1925, with the sudden influx of the &quot;Optanten&quot;, inhabitants of areas annexed by Poland who opted not to become Polish citizens and left for the reduced German Reich. Schneidemühl&#x27;s population swelled by about 10,000 to 37,518, creating considerable publicity in Germany.

In 1930 Schneidemühl replaced Tütz (Tuczno) as seat of the Catholic jurisdiction, which was promoted from Apostolic administration to Territorial Prelature of Schneidemühl within the Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province. The city experienced a short period of growth followed by a period of decline in the early 1930s. High unemployment and the ineffectiveness of local administration led to rising support for the NSDAP.

===Nazi rule and Second World War===
With the onset of the Nazi period and the beginning of the Gestapo&#x27;s harassment of political and racial undesirables, the climate for Schneidemühl&#x27;s shrinking Jewish community (which had reached over 1,000 members during the mid-19th century) changed irreversibly — institutionalized antisemitism had arrived in Schneidemühl.

In March and September 1938, a &quot;Verwaltungsgliederung,&quot; or administrative reform, merged the three territorially unconnected parts of the Frontier March of Posen-West Prussia province into the respective neighbouring Prussian provinces of Brandenburg, Silesia and Pomerania — placing the bulk of former Posen-West Prussia with the districts of Deutsch Krone, Flatow, &quot;Netzekreis&quot;, Schlochau and Schneidemühl into Pomerania. Schneidemühl remained the headquarters of the government region, reduced by the districts ceded to Brandenburg and Silesia, but enlarged by four previously Brandenburgian and Pomeranian districts and renamed as (&quot;Regierungsbezirk Grenzmark Posen-Westpreußen&quot;) for reasons of tradition, as of 1 October 1938.

During the pogrom of 9/10 November 1938 the freestanding structure of Schneidemühl&#x27;s 100-year-old synagogue became a prime target for the Nazis who set fire to it. In 1939, in the city and the region, the Germans carried out mass arrests of Polish activists, who then were imprisoned in a temporary camp in the city before deportation to Nazi concentration camps, some were even tortured. In October 1939, a German camp for Sinti and Romani people was established. The city&#x27;s 300-year-old Jewish community was destroyed when on 21 March 1940, on the order of Gauleiter Schwede-Coburg, the last remaining Jews, together with more than 500 Jews of the surrounding area within an radius, were arrested and held prisoner in various locations in the city. A large number of them were subsequently taken to the forced labour camp Radinkendorf and the Glowno prisoner camp outside of Poznań and held there in detention under inhuman conditions. Over the following two years they were taken to various labour camps, hospices, hospitals in Pomerania, Bielefeld and Berlin. Those who had not committed suicide or had perished during that period were deported to concentration camps, the last in 1943. During World War II a camp for civil prisoners-of-war named &quot;Albatros&quot; was established. Poles expelled from Gmina Dziemiany in Gdańsk Pomerania were used as forced labour in the local aviation industry. Also seven forced labour subcamps of the Stalag II-B prisoner-of-war camp and a forced labour camp, which was subordinate to the local prison, were operated in the city. Several British POWs escaped, and then the Polish resistance facilitated their further escape through the port of Gdynia by sea to Sweden. The local Home Army also maintained contact with Polish POWs held in the Oflag II-C camp.

The city became part of the Pomeranian Wall line of fortifications. In 1945 the town was declared a fortress by Adolf Hitler. During the East Pomeranian offensive it was captured by the joint Polish and Red Army forces after two weeks of heavy fighting on 14 February 1945. 75% of the city was destroyed and almost 90% of the historic city centre was in ruins.

===Post-war Poland===

As a result of the border changes agreed at the Potsdam Conference in 1945, the city became again part of Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. The city&#x27;s historic Polish name &quot;Piła&quot; was restored. The remaining local German population was expelled by Polish and Soviet troops from 1945 to 1948 in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, while Polish expelees from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union and settlers from areas of central Poland, which were destroyed during the war, were resettled in the city. The historical city centre was only partially restored.

In 1972 the Territorial Prelature of Piła was suppressed, its territory being reassigned to establish the Diocese of Koszalin–Kołobrzeg and Diocese of Gorzów.

In August 1980, employees of local factories joined the nationwide anti-communist strikes, which led to the foundation of the Solidarity organization, which played a central role in the end of communist rule in Poland.

In 1975 Piła became the capital of the newly established Piła Voivodeship (province), which started a period of fast development of industry in the area as one of the most important cities of the region. It remained a voivodeship capital until the administrative reform of 1999. It is known for its green areas and parks, as well as for its speedway club Polonia Piła who race at the Stadion Polonii Piła.

<text>Chodzież () is a town in northwestern Poland with 17,976 inhabitants as of December 2021, seat of the Chodzież County in the Greater Poland Voivodeship.

==Geography==

Chodzież is located in the northern part of Greater Poland (western Poland), in the Chodzieskie lakelands. The most important characteristics of this lakeland area are its typical postglacial landforms, forests of pines and mixed woodlands, and lakes. For this reason, the city&#x27;s surroundings are known as &quot;the Switzerland of Chodzież&quot;.

Five kilometers west of Chodzież, at the edge of the Chodzieskie lakelands, Mt. Gontyniec rises 192 meters above sea level as the highest peak in a chain of moraine hills; at the same time it has the highest elevation in northern Poland. Deep valleys and ridges covered with a 100-year-old beech forest ensure diversified surroundings.

Within the five square miles (13 km2) of city area, there are three lakes: Miejskie, 1 km2 (English: &quot;Town lake&quot;, 0.4 mile²), Karczewnik, , and Strzeleckie, , which make up about 13% of the total town area.

==History==
A burial mound, estimated to date from 2000 B.C., is located in the area of the town where today&#x27;s Słoneczna street lies. From about 1500 BC, tribes belonging to the Lusatian culture dominated the area for ten centuries. In 1904–1914 two burial grounds were discovered in the area of old Rzeźnicka street, that date to those times. In the early Middle Ages (400–700 AD), a little settlement existed on the south part of Lake Miejskie. Chodzież&#x27;s beginnings go back at least to the 15th century. First written mention is from 1403. The name Chodzies is mentioned with that of the priest of the local Catholic parish. Researchers believe however, that town roots go back to the 13th century, when it already had its first church.

On 3 March 1434, King Władysław II Jagiello issued a privilege that vested Chodzież with Magdeburg town rights for Trojan of Łękno. For many centuries it was a privately owned city, located within the Kalisz Voivodeship (from 1768 in the Gniezno Voivodeship) in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. The LÍkiscy–Granowski family were the first owners, then from the mid of the 15th century, Chodzież belonged to the Potulicki family. From 1648 to 1830 the Grudziński family were the owners of Chodzież. The family&#x27;s Grzymała coat of arms has been the town&#x27;s crest since that time.
St. Florian&#x27;s church situated at the Market Square, is the oldest monument in Chodzież. Its probable founder was the first owner of the settlement, Trojan of Lekno.

During the 17th century, various parts of Poland were invaded by Swedish troops. The arrival of a group of German clothmakers from Leszno, which had suffered a fire, around 1656, influenced the development of Chodzież. A new town was erected in the mid 18th century, next to the old medieval site in the city, which contained the Market, as the home of weavers and clothmakers. Today, this part of the city (Kościuszki Street) is marked by the characteristic gables of houses situated on narrow, rectangular plots of land. Each lot formerly had wooden sheds in the rear to store wool and cloth.

As the result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and became a part of the newly established Netze River District.

In 1805, Chodzież&#x27;s weavers imported a weaving machine from Berlin. Shortly after, Napoleon defeated Prussia (1807) and out of the Treaty of Tilsit, this part of Poland became part of the Duchy of Warsaw.

In 1815, Prussia and its allies defeated Napoleon, and this area became Prussian again as the Grand Duchy of Posen. It was supposed to be a Polish province within Prussian Kingdom. In reality, it was essentially a Prussian province. 
The local weaving industry declined about 1812–1815, when a frontier customs post between the Duchy of Warsaw and the Kingdom of Prussia was demarcated. The tariff priced the Posen weavers out of their major eastern markets, so they either migrated to other textile producing areas (e.g. Łódź) or turned to other types of work, like farming.

In 1818, Chodzież became the administrative center of a county-like district (German: &quot;Kreis&quot;) (see Kreis Kolmar in Posen) that was formed from parts of the following these Kreise: Wirsitz, Wongrowitz, Obornik and Czarnikau (Polish: &quot;Wyrzysk, Wągrowiec, Oborniki&quot; and &quot;Czarnków&quot;). Over the years, it gained the character of a local administrative center, which it remained until 1975, when the division of Poland was reorganized into larger units.

In 1849, the Duchy was formalized as the Prussian province of Posen.

Chodzież&#x27;s important place in the ceramics industry began when two German businessmen, Ludwig Schnorr and Hermann Müller from Frankfurt an der Oder, purchased the ruins of the burned out manor house from Otto Königsmarck in 1855 and built the first faience factory. In 1897 the merchant Hein, a former faience factory owner, built a porcelain factory. Since then, Chodzież has always been an important and significant center of pottery industry.

The German Empire was created in 1871, and in October 1874 a system of civil registration offices were created. Chodziesen was chosen for its area. (See Standesamt Kolmar).

In 1879, the railroad line Poznań — Chodzież — Piła was opened and the name of Chodzież was changed from &quot;Chodzeisen&quot; to &quot;Kolmar in Posen&quot;. This name was in honor of Axel von Colmar — Meyenburg, who was extremely influential in the building of the railway, which was beneficial to the town&#x27;s economy.

===Interbellum===

After World War I, Poland regained independence and the Greater Poland Uprising, the aim of which was to reintegrate the region with Poland, spread to Chodzież. Polish insurgents captured the town on January 6, 1919, and then, despite prior agreements, the Germans recaptured it the next day.
After bloody fighting the insurgents again captured the town on January 8, 1919. The Versailles Treaty in 1919 eventually confirmed the restoration of Chodzież to Poland. On 19 January 1920, Polish military and political authorities marched into the city and a Polish administration was established. Unemployment and living conditions deteriorated, leading to a wave of strikes, starting in 1921. In the 1930s, the years of the great world economic crisis, workers from Chodzież porcelain factory started a new series of protests. In the period between the two world wars, Chodzież was considered as an important administrative center in the border area between Poland and Germany. It had a working class character, which was related to the development of the faience factory. Since the town was located near the border, 16% of the population was German, while 83% was Polish, as of 1939.

In the 1920s, a tuberculosis sanatorium was established here because of the special climate. It was converted recently into a hospital for railroadmen. In 1921 Stanisław Mańczak bought the porcelain fabric from the Annaburger Steinguttfabrik firm.

===World War II===

In September 1939 the town was invaded by Nazi Germany. Early on, the &quot;SS-Totenkopf-Standarte Brandenburg&quot; entered the town to commit various atrocities against the Polish population. The German occupation, both in Chodzież and the whole country, was a period of terror directed against Polish citizens. In one notable example, on 7 November 1939, 44 Polish men, including the town&#x27;s mayor Tadeusz Koppe and the gmina&#x27;s wójt Marian Weyhan, were killed on the Morzewskie Hills near the village of Morzewo. Germans carried out mass arrests of Poles as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, who were then imprisoned in the local prison. Local Poles were also subjected to expulsions and deportations to forced labour in Germany, and a transit camp for Poles expelled from the region was located in the town. Hundreds of Poles were expelled already in December 1939. Houses of expelled Poles were handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy, and as a result, Germans formed 56% of the town&#x27;s populace in 1943. Under Nazi German occupation, the town under the Germanized name &quot;Kolmar&quot; was made part of Reichsgau Wartheland, and the seat of the county (&quot;kreis&quot;) of Kolmar. The &quot;Rynek&quot; (Market Square) was renamed the &quot;Adolf Hitler Square&quot;.

Despite such circumstances, the Polish resistance movement was still formed and operated in the town and area. Among its local leaders were Marcel Krzycki and pre-war Polish mayor Bronisław Maron. In August 1944, the Germans carried out mass arrests of local members of the Home Army, the leading Polish underground resistance organization. Local Polish resistance leaders were imprisoned and tortured in the local prison and in the Gestapo station in Poznań. Bronisław Maron, his wife, daughter, and Marcel Krzycki were then imprisoned in the Nazi prison camp in Żabikowo (present-day district of Luboń). Bronisław Maron, tortured, died there in 1944, while his wife and daughter were deported to the Ravensbrück concentration camp, where his wife was also murdered. Krzycki&#x27;s fate is unknown, although he probably also died in Żabikowo. The population of Chodzież during the war years was reduced by almost half.

Liberation came on the night of 22/23 January 1945, when Soviet troops captured the town.

===Recent period===
The first years after World War II were a period of restoration and an intensive development of the pottery industry.

In 1946 Chodzież had a population of 7,694. From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Piła Voivodeship.

The city administration has received prizes and awards on several occasions to recognize the city&#x27;s cleanliness and aesthetics. In 1974, the city was awarded the title of &quot;the Polish Master of Economics.&quot; Later, in 1979, it was awarded the Labor Medal, 1st Class, by the Council of State for the city&#x27;s achievements in production. The current construction of an urban purification plant will help transform Chodzież into an ecologically clean center for tourism and relaxation. In recent years, the rate of economic development in the city have decreased somewhat, with industry playing a smaller role and the economic development of Chodzież and the region becoming more associated with recreation. Chodzież&#x27;s natural environment attracts tourists.

==Sports==
The local football club is Polonia Chodzież, and the athletics club is Gontyniec Chodzież.

The town&#x27;s sports facilities include an indoor swimming pool, a football stadium and tennis courts. Sailing and motorboat contests take place each year on the municipal lakes. These lakes have European and world-class rank: in 1993, motorboat contests took place in the class 0..350. In addition, every May, the Grzmylita Run promotes sport for the masses.

==Culture==
A brass orchestra was founded right after the end of the German occupation. First it was connected to the ceramics factory, but currently it works with the Chodzież cultural institute. In the 1970s, the annual jazz workshops began, which allowed new talents to be discovered through encounters between young people and artists from Poland and abroad.

The annual National Children&#x27;s Song Festivals began in 1991. In 1995, Chodzież was the co-organizer of the XIII National Voluntary Fire Department Brass Orchestra Festival.

<text>Wyszków (; &quot;Vishkov&quot;) is a town in eastern Poland with 26,500 inhabitants (2018). It is the capital of Wyszków County in Masovian Voivodeship.

==History==
The village of Wyszków was first documented in 1203. Wyszków was located on a trade route connecting Toruń with Brześć. It was granted town rights in 1502. It was administratively located in the Kamieniec County in the Masovian Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. It was destroyed during the Swedish invasion of Poland (Second Northern War) in 1655–1660, and it lost its significance in the region.

It was annexed by Prussia in the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. In 1807 it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and in 1815 it passed to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1870 it was deprived of its town rights, as one of many Polish town punished by the Russians for the unsuccessful Polish January Uprising. Industry developed after 1897, when the Pilawa-Tłuszcz-Ostrołęka railway was built. In 1918 Poland regained independence and control of Wyszków, and in 1919 town rights were restored.
During the Polish–Soviet War, on August 17, 1920, the Russian Cheka murdered seven Poles in the present-day district of . Poles led by Mikołaj Bołtuć defeated the invading Russians in the on August 18, 1920.

Fierce fights between the Poles and the invading Germans took place in the area on September 8–10, 1939 at the beginning of World War II. On September 9, 1939, the Germans committed a massacre of 65 Jews in Wyszków, and a massacre of a dozen or so Poles from Wyszków near the village of Pniewo (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). The town was then occupied by Germany, which made it part of the Warsaw District of the General Government. Before the war 45% of Wyszków&#x27;s population of 12,000 were Jewish; after the war there were none. The Germans killed over 7,000 inhabitants of Wyszków, including 5,000 Jews, and operated a forced labour camp for Soviet prisoners of war. Nevertheless, the Polish resistance movement was active in the area. After the occupation, the town was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which remained in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. The communists destroyed pre-war memorials dedicated to Poles killed during the Polish–Soviet War in 1920.

In post-war Poland, the town was administratively part of the Warsaw Voivodeship until 1975, and the Ostrołęka Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998. In 1961, Rybienko Leśne was included within Wyszków&#x27;s town limits as a new district.

On 14 September 1997 a memorial to Holocaust victims was unveiled in Wyszków. It is made of reclaimed Jewish gravestones that had been removed from the site in 1939 by German forces, who used them as paving stones and to build the local Gestapo headquarters. Scores of these desecrated tombstones were recovered and incorporated as part of the monument.

A monument of Polish mathematician and cryptologist Jerzy Różycki was unveiled in 2018.

<text>Ostrów Mazowiecka (; ) is a town in eastern Poland with 23,486 inhabitants (2004). It is the capital of Ostrów Mazowiecka County in Masovian Voivodeship.

==History==

Ostrów was granted town rights in 1434 by Duke Bolesław IV of Warsaw. Its name comes from the Old Polish word &quot;ostrowa&quot;. In 1461 a parish school was founded in the town. In 1514, Duchess Anna Radziwiłł, who is commemorated in the town with a monument, established four annual fairs and a weekly market, boosting the development of Ostrów. In the 16th century Polish King Sigismund II Augustus built a residence in Ostrów. Ostrów was a Polish royal town, administratively located in the Masovian Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland.

The town&#x27;s inhabitants took part in the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794; however, the following year it was annexed by Prussia in the Third Partition of Poland. In 1807 it was included in the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and in 1815 it became part of so-called Congress Poland within the Russian Partition of Poland. Many inhabitants took part in several battles of the Polish January Uprising of 1863–1864 against Russia, and an insurgent hospital was located in Ostrów. Ostrów was subjected to anti-Polish repressions, was one of the sites of Russian executions of Polish insurgents, and there are memorials at the execution sites. Despite such circumstances, in the following decades, various Polish organizations were founded in Ostrów. In the 19th century, the town saw a significant influx of Jewish settlers as a result of Russian discriminatory policies, and according to the 1897 census, 5,660 inhabitants out of 10,471 were Jews. During World War I, it was occupied by Germany, and after the war, in 1918, it became part of restored independent Poland. In 1919 a reserve battalion of the Polish 15th Wolves Infantry Regiment was stationed in Ostrów Mazowiecka. It trained Polish soldiers to reinforce the 15th Wolves Infantry Regiment during the Polish–Soviet War. In 1920 a battle was fought on the town&#x27;s outskirts during the Polish–Soviet War. After the war, the battalion with the entire regiment was relocated to Dęblin in 1921.

===World War II===
During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, Ostrów Mazowiecka was captured by Germany on September 8, 1939, and in mid-September the &quot;Einsatzgruppe V&quot; entered the town to commit various atrocities against the population. Already on 19 September the Germans arrested nine Poles, including chairmen of local veterans&#x27; organizations Włodzimierz Gadomski and Jan Radbalski. On 9 November 1939, one of the German soldiers set fire to the buildings on 3-ego Maja Street. The German authorities accused the Jews of starting the fire. On 11 November (though according to other sources, on 10 November) 500–800 Jews were killed by the German police in the Ostrów Mazowiecka massacre.
The Polish underground resistance movement was organized already in autumn of 1939. The first resistance organizations in the area were Service for Poland&#x27;s Victory, , , National Military Organization, Secret Polish Army, , , . Major Eugeniusz Mieszkowski &quot;nom de guerre Ostry&quot; unified the resistance organizations into a district of the Home Army under the cryptonym &quot;Opocznik&quot; (&quot;wheatear&quot;). It covered the Ostrów County, and was divided into five centers, one of which was located in the town. In addition to typical military, sabotage, and intelligence activities, the resistance movement also organized secret Polish education and issued and distributed underground Polish press. On May 1, 1943, the Home Army blew up the headquarters of the German &quot;Arbeitsamt&quot; in retaliation for round-ups and deportations of the local population for forced labour. On May 25, 1943, the Polish resistance successfully assassinated the chief of the local German administration, in retaliation for which the Germans massacred about 140 Poles. The German occupation ended in 1944, and Ostrów was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. The NKVD and UB repressed members of the Polish resistance movement and began arresting and deporting them to the Soviet Union in September 1944. Many members of the Home Army soon returned to the underground and continued their resistance against the communists.

<text>Na-Dene ( ; also Nadene, Na-Dené, Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit, Tlina–Dene) is a family of Native American languages that includes at least the Athabaskan languages, Eyak, and Tlingit languages. Haida was formerly included but is now considered doubtful. By far the most widely spoken Na-Dene language today is Navajo, also the most spoken indigenous language north of Mexico.

In February 2008, a proposal connecting Na-Dene (excluding Haida) to the Yeniseian languages of central Siberia into a Dené–Yeniseian family was published and well received by a number of linguists. It was proposed in a 2014 paper that the Na-Dene languages of North America and the Yeniseian languages of Siberia had a common origin in a language spoken in Beringia, between the two continents.

== Etymology ==
Edward Sapir originally constructed the term &quot;Na-Dene&quot; to refer to a combined family of Athabaskan, Tlingit, and Haida (the existence of the Eyak language was not known to him at the time). In his “The Na-Dene languages: A preliminary report”, he describes how he arrived at the term (Sapir 1915, p. 558):

In its uncontroversial core, Na-Dene consists of two branches, Tlingit and Athabaskan–Eyak:
* Na-Dene
** Tlingit: 1,360 speakers
** Athabaskan–Eyak
*** Eyak: the last native speaker died in 2008, revitalization efforts are underway.
*** Athabaskan
**** Northern
**** Pacific Coast
**** Southern
For linguists who follow Edward Sapir in connecting Haida to the above languages, Haida represents an additional branch, with Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit together forming the other. Dene or Dine (the Athabaskan languages) is a widely distributed group of Native languages spoken by associated peoples in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Alaska, parts of Oregon, northern California, and the American Southwest as far as northern Mexico.

The southwestern division of Athabaskan is also called Southern Athabaskan or Apachean, and includes Navajo and all the Apache languages. Eyak was spoken by the Eyak people in south-central Alaska; the last first-language speaker died in 2008. Navajo is by far the most widely spoken language of the Na-Dene family, spoken in Arizona, New Mexico, and other regions of the American Southwest.

==Typological profile of Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit==
All of these languages share a highly complex prefixing verb structure in which tense and mood markers are interdigitated between subject and object agreement markers. The morphological hallmark of the family is a series of prefixes found directly before the verb root that raise or lower the transitivity of the verb word. These prefixes, traditionally known as &quot;classifiers&quot;, derive historically from a combination of three distinct classes of morphemes and are not found in any other Native American language family.

The phoneme system contains a large number of dorsal (velar or uvular) consonants (fronting in many modern Athabaskan languages to palatals and velars, correspondingly) as well as a general absence of labial obstruents (except where /b/ has arisen from *w). In the historical phonology there is a widespread tendency, observable across many Athabaskan languages, for phonemic tonal distinctions to arise from glottal features originally found at the end of the syllable. The glottal features in question are often evident in Eyak or Tlingit. These languages are typologically unusual in containing extensive prefixation yet being SOV and postpositional, features normally associated with suffixing languages.

==Proposals of deeper genealogical relations involving Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit==
A genealogical connection between the Tlingit, Eyak and Athabaskan languages was suggested early in the 19th century, but not universally accepted until much later. Haida, with 15 fluent speakers (M. Krauss, 1995), was originally linked to Tlingit by Franz Boas in 1894. Both Haida and Tlingit were then connected to Athabaskan by Edward Sapir in 1915. Linguists such as Lyle Campbell (1997) today consider the evidence inconclusive. They have classified Haida as a language isolate. In order to emphasise the exclusion of Haida, Campbell refers to the language family as &quot;Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit&quot; rather than &quot;Na-Dene&quot;. In 2010 Jeff Leer published extensive primary materials on what he calls &quot;PAET&quot; (Proto-Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit).

===Dené–Yeniseian===
In 2008, Edward Vajda of Western Washington University presented evidence suggesting that the Na-Dene languages (Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit) might be related to the Yeniseian (or Yeniseic) languages of Siberia, the only living representative of which is the Ket language.

Key evidence by current comparative methodologies includes homologies in verb prefixes and also a systematic correspondence between the distribution of Ket tones and consonant articulations found in Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit. Vajda&#x27;s paper has been favorably reviewed by several experts on Na-Dene and Yeniseic languages, including Michael Krauss, Jeff Leer, James Kari, and Heinrich Werner, as well as a number of other well-known linguists, including Bernard Comrie, Johanna Nichols, Victor Golla, Michael Fortescue, and Eric Hamp. The conclusion of this seminar was that the comparison with Yeniseic data shows that Haida cannot be classified in a genealogical unit with Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit.

=== Sino-Tibetan ===
A link between the Na–Dené languages and Sino-Tibetan languages, known as Sino–Dené was proposed by Edward Sapir. Around 1920 Sapir became convinced that Na-Dené was more closely related to Sino-Tibetan than to other American families. He wrote a series of letters to Alfred Kroeber where he enthusiastically spoke of a connection between Na-Dene and &quot;Indo-Chinese&quot;. In 1925, a supporting article summarizing his thoughts, albeit not written by him, entitled &quot;The Similarities of Chinese and Indian Languages&quot;, was published in Science Supplements. The Sino-Dene hypothesis never gained foothold in the United States outside of Sapir’s circle, though it was later revitalized by Robert Shafer (1952, 1957, 1969) and Morris Swadesh (1952, 1965). 

Edward Vajda&#x27;s Dené–Yeniseian proposal renewed interest among linguists such as Geoffrey Caveney (2014) to look into support for the Sino–Dené hypothesis. Caveney considered a link between Sino-Tibetan, Na-Dené, and Yeniseian to be plausible but did not support the hypothesis that Sino-Tibetan and Na-Dené were related to the Caucasian languages (Sino–Caucasian and Dené–Caucasian).

A 2023 analysis by David Bradley using the standard techniques of comparative linguistics supports a distant genetic link between the Sino-Tibetan, Na-Dené, and Yeniseian language families. Bradley argues that any similarities Sino-Tibetan shares with other language families of the East Asia area such as Hmong-Mien, Altaic (which is actually a sprachbund), Austroasiatic, Kra-Dai, Austronesian came through contact; but as there has been no recent contact between Sino-Tibetan, Na-Dené, and Yeniseian language families, then any similarities these groups share must be residual.

===Other proposals===
According to Joseph Greenberg&#x27;s controversial classification of the languages of Native North America, Na-Dené (including Haida) is one of the three main groups of Native languages spoken in the Americas. Contemporary supporters of Greenberg&#x27;s theory, such as Merritt Ruhlen, have suggested that the Na-Dené language family represents a distinct migration of people from Asia into the New World that occurred six to eight thousand years ago, placing it around four thousand years later than the previous migration into the Americas by Amerind speakers; this remains an unproven hypothesis. Ruhlen speculates that the Na-Dené speakers may have arrived in boats, initially settling near the Haida Gwaii, now in British Columbia, Canada.

Bouda, in various publications in the 1930s through the 1950s, described a linguistic network that (besides Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan) also included Caucasian, and Burushaski, some forms of which have gone by the name of Sino-Caucasian. The works of R. Bleichsteiner and O.G. Tailleur, the late Sergei A. Starostin and Sergei L. Nikolayev have sought to confirm these connections. Others who have developed the hypothesis, often expanded to Dené–Caucasian, include J.D. Bengtson, V. Blažek, J.H. Greenberg (with M. Ruhlen), and M. Ruhlen. George Starostin continues his father&#x27;s work in Yeniseian, Sino-Caucasian and other fields. 
This theory is very controversial or viewed as obsolete by other linguists.

== Genetics and dispersal ==
Speakers of the Na-Dene languages, while mostly closely related to other North American indigenous peoples, derive around 10% of their ancestry from a Siberian source closely related to Koryaks not found in other Native American groups. The contact between the ancestors of Na-Dene speakers and this Siberian group is suggested to have occurred around 9,000-5,500 years ago. The urheimat (origin point of the family) has been suggested to have been in Alaska. A large southward migration of Athabaskan peoples is thought to have occurred around 1,000 years ago, resulting in the settlement of southern North America.

==Obstruent correspondences==
This phonological chart shows where the listed varieties have sounds which are the same, similar, and sometimes different. The sounds shown, obstruents, are a particular class of consonants. Where similarities are found between one or more varieties, this presents at least some evidence of genetic relatedness among those varieties.


Table notes:

# To prevent cluttering the table, phonemes in the PAET, PAE and PA columns are not asterisked.
# Leer (2008, 2010) does not reconstruct the PAET affricates , and . Judging from their rarity, he assumes they may be attributable to the resolution of former consonant clusters.
# In Athabaskan and Eyak, sibilants can be diminutive variants of shibilants. In Tlingit, on the other hand, shibilants might sometimes be diminutive variants of sibilants. These correspondences are in parentheses.

<text>Smoking bans, or smoke-free laws, are public policies, including criminal laws and occupational safety and health regulations, that prohibit tobacco smoking in certain spaces. The spaces most commonly affected by smoking bans are indoor workplaces and buildings open to the public such as restaurants, bars, office buildings, schools, retail stores, hospitals, libraries, transport facilities, and government buildings, in addition to public transport vehicles such as aircraft, buses, watercraft, and trains. However, laws may also prohibit smoking in outdoor areas such as parks, beaches, pedestrian plazas, college and hospital campuses, and within a certain distance from the entrance to a building, and in some cases, private vehicles and multi-unit residences.

The most common rationale cited for restrictions on smoking is the negative health effects associated with secondhand smoke (SHS), or the inhalation of tobacco smoke by persons who are not smoking. These include diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The number of smoking bans around the world increased substantially in the late 20th century and early 21st century due to increased knowledge about these health risks. Many early smoking restrictions merely required the designation of non-smoking areas in buildings, but policies of this type became less common following evidence that they did not eliminate the health concerns associated with SHS.

Opinions on smoking bans vary. Many individuals and organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) support smoking bans on the basis that they improve health outcomes by reducing exposure to SHS and possibly decreasing the number of people who smoke, while others oppose smoking bans and assert that they violate individual and property rights and cause economic hardship, among other issues.

==Rationale==

Smoking bans are usually enacted in an attempt to protect non-smokers from the effects of secondhand smoke, which include an increased risk of heart disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other diseases. Laws implementing bans on indoor smoking have been introduced by many countries and other jurisdictions as public knowledge about these health risks increased.

Additional rationales for smoking restrictions include reduced risk of fire in areas with explosive hazards; cleanliness in places where food, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, or precision instruments and machinery are produced; decreased legal liability; potentially reduced energy use via decreased ventilation needs; reduced quantities of litter; healthier environments; and giving smokers incentive to quit.

==Evidence basis==
Research has generated evidence that secondhand smoke causes the same problems as direct smoking, including lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and lung ailments such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma. Specifically, meta-analyses show that lifelong non-smokers with partners who smoke in the home have a 20–30% greater risk of lung cancer than non-smokers who live with non-smokers. Non-smokers exposed to cigarette smoke in the workplace have an increased lung cancer risk of 16–19%. An epidemiology report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), convened by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), says that the risk of coronary heart disease is increased by around 25–30% when one is exposed to secondhand smoke. The data shows that even at low levels of exposure, there is risk and the risk increases with more exposure.

A study issued in 2002 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization concluded that non-smokers are exposed to the same carcinogens on account of tobacco smoke as active smokers. Sidestream smoke emitted from the burning ends of tobacco products contains 69 known carcinogens, particularly benzopyrene and other polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and radioactive decay products, such as polonium-210. Several well-established carcinogens have been shown by the tobacco companies&#x27; own research to be present at higher concentrations in secondhand smoke than in mainstream smoke.

Scientific organisations confirming the effects of secondhand smoke include the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the Surgeon General of the United States, and the World Health Organization.

===Air quality in bars and restaurants===
Restrictions upon smoking in bars and restaurants can substantially improve the air quality in such establishments. For example, one study listed on the website of the CDC states that New York&#x27;s statewide law to eliminate smoking in enclosed workplaces and public places substantially reduced RSP (respirable suspended particles) levels in western New York hospitality venues. RSP levels were reduced in every venue that permitted smoking before the law was implemented, including venues in which only smoke from an adjacent room was observed at baseline. The CDC concluded that their results were similar to other studies which also showed substantially improved indoor air quality after smoking bans were instituted.

A 2004 study showed New Jersey bars and restaurants had more than nine times the levels of indoor air pollution of neighbouring New York City, which had already enacted its smoking ban.

Research has also shown that improved air quality translates to decreased toxin exposure among employees. For example, among employees of the Norwegian establishments that enacted smoking restrictions, tests showed decreased levels of nicotine in the urine of both smoking and non-smoking workers (as compared with measurements prior to going smoke-free).
===Public Health Law Research===
In 2009, the Public Health Law Research Program, a national program office of the US-based Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, published an evidence brief summarising the research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health. They stated that &quot;There is strong evidence supporting smoking bans and restrictions as effective public health interventions aimed at decreasing exposure to secondhand smoke.&quot;

==History==

One of the world&#x27;s earliest smoking bans was a 1575 Roman Catholic Church regulation which forbade the use of tobacco in any church in Mexico. In 1590, Pope Urban VII moved against smoking in church buildings. He threatened to excommunicate anyone who &quot;took tobacco in the porchway of or inside a church, whether it be by chewing it, smoking it with a pipe or sniffing it in powdered form through the nose&quot;. Pope Urban VIII imposed similar restrictions in 1624. In 1604 King James VI and I published an anti-smoking treatise, &quot;A Counterblaste to Tobacco&quot;, that had the effect of raising taxes on tobacco. Russia banned tobacco for 70 years from 1627.
The Ottoman Sultan Murad IV prohibited smoking in his empire in 1633 and had smokers executed. The earliest citywide European smoking bans were enacted shortly thereafter. Such bans were enacted in Bavaria, Kursachsen, and certain parts of Austria in the late 17th century. Smoking was banned in Berlin in 1723, in Königsberg in 1742, and in Stettin in 1744. These bans were repealed in the revolutions of 1848. Prior to 1865 Russia had a ban on smoking in the streets.

The first building in the world to ban smoking was the Old Government Building in Wellington, New Zealand in 1876. The ban related to concerns about the threat of fire, as it is the second largest wooden building in the world.

The first modern attempt at restricting smoking saw Nazi Germany banning smoking in every university, post office, military hospital, and Nazi Party office, under the auspices of Karl Astel&#x27;s Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research, established in 1941 under orders from Adolf Hitler. The Nazis conducted major anti-tobacco campaigns until the demise of their regime in 1945.

In the latter part of the 20th century, as research on the risks of secondhand tobacco smoke became public, the tobacco industry launched &quot;courtesy awareness&quot; campaigns. Fearing reduced sales, the industry began a media and legislative programme that focused upon &quot;accommodation&quot;. Tolerance and courtesy were encouraged as a way to ease heightened tensions between smokers and those around them, while avoiding smoking bans. In the US, states were encouraged to pass laws providing separate smoking sections.

In 1975 the U.S. state of Minnesota enacted the &quot;Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act&quot;, making it the first state to restrict smoking in most public spaces. At first restaurants were required to have &quot;No Smoking&quot; sections, and bars were exempt from the Act. As of 1 October 2007 Minnesota enacted a ban on smoking in all restaurants and bars statewide, called the Freedom to Breathe Act of 2007.

The resort town of Aspen, Colorado, became the first city in the US to restrict smoking in restaurants, in 1985, though it allowed smoking in areas that were separately ventilated.

On 3 April 1987 the city of Beverly Hills, California, initiated an ordinance to restrict smoking in most restaurants, in retail stores and at public meetings. It exempted restaurants in hotels – City Council members reasoned that hotel restaurants catered to large numbers of visitors from abroad, where smoking is more acceptable than in the United States.

In 1990 the city of San Luis Obispo, California, became the first city in the world to restrict indoor smoking in bars as well as in restaurants. The ban did not include workplaces, but covered all other indoor public spaces and its enforcement was somewhat limited.

In the United States, California&#x27;s 1998 smoking ban encouraged other states such as New York to implement similar regulations. California&#x27;s ban included a controversial restriction upon smoking in bars, extending the statewide ban enacted in 1994. As of April 2009, there were 37 states with some form of smoking ban. Some areas in California began banning smoking across whole cities, including every place except residential homes. More than 20 cities in California enacted park- and beach-smoking restrictions. In May 2011, New York City expanded its previously implemented smoking ban by banning smoking in parks, beaches and boardwalks, public golf courses and other areas controlled by the New York City Parks Department. In recent years New York City has passed administrative codes §17-502 and §17-508 forcing landlords of privately owned buildings, cooperatives, and condominiums to adopt a smoking policy into all leases. These codes oblige landlords to enact provisions telling tenants the exact locations where they can or can not smoke. In January 2010, the mayor of Boston, Massachusetts, Thomas Menino, proposed a restriction upon smoking inside public housing apartments under the jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Authority.

From December 1993, in Peru, it became illegal to smoke in any public enclosed place and any public transport vehicle (according to Law 25357 issued on 27 November 1991 and its regulations issued on 25 November 1993 by decree D.S.983-93-PCM). There is also legislation restricting publicity, and it is also illegal (Law 26957 21 May 1998) to sell tobacco to minors or directly to advertise tobacco within 500m of schools (Law 26849 9 Jul 1997).

On 11 November 1975 Italy banned smoking on public transit vehicles (except for smokers&#x27; rail carriages) and in some public buildings (hospitals, cinemas, theatres, museums, universities and libraries). After an unsuccessful attempt in 1986, on 16 January 2003 the Italian parliament passed the &quot;Legge Sirchia&quot;, which would ban smoking in all indoor public places, including bars, restaurants, discotheques and offices from 10 January 2005.

On 3 December 2003, New Zealand passed legislation to progressively implement a smoking ban in schools, school grounds, and workplaces by December 2004.

On 29 March 2004, the Republic of Ireland implemented a nationwide ban on smoking in all workplaces. In Norway, similar legislation came into force on 1 June the same year.

In Scotland, Andy Kerr, the Minister for Health and Community Care, introduced a ban on smoking in public areas on 26 March 2006. Smoking was banned in all public places in the whole of the United Kingdom in 2007, when England became the final region to have the legislation come into effect (the age limit for buying tobacco also increased from 16 to 18 on 1 October 2007).

On 12 July 1999 a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in India banned smoking in public places by declaring &quot;public smoking as illegal first time in the history of whole world, unconstitutional and violative of Article 21 of the Constitution&quot;. The Bench, headed by Dr. Justice K. Narayana Kurup, held that &quot;tobacco smoking&quot; in public places (in the form of cigarettes, cigars, beedies or otherwise) &quot;falls within the mischief of the penal provisions relating to public nuisance as contained in the Indian Penal Code and also the definition of air pollution as contained in the statutes dealing with the protection and preservation of the environment, in particular, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution), Act 1981.&quot;

In 2003 India introduced a law that banned smoking in public places like restaurants, public transport or schools. The same law also made it illegal to advertise cigarettes or other tobacco products.

In 2010 Nepal planned to enact a new anti-smoking bill that would ban smoking in public places and outlaw all tobacco advertising to prevent young people from smoking.

On 31 May 2011 Venezuela introduced a ban on smoking in all enclosed public and commercial spaces, including malls, restaurants, bars, discos, workplaces, etc.

Smoking was first restricted in schools, hospitals, trains, buses and train stations in Turkey in 1996. In 2008 a more comprehensive smoking ban was implemented, covering all public indoor venues.

The Plage Lumière beach in La Ciotat, France, became the first beach in Europe to restrict smoking from August 2011, in an effort to encourage more tourists to visit the beach.

In 2012, smoking in Costa Rica became subject to some of the most restrictive regulations in the world, with the practice being banned from many outdoor recreational and educational areas as well as in public buildings and vehicles.

==Public support==
According to a 2018 Gallup poll, 25% of U.S. adults believe that smoking should be completely banned in the country, marking the highest level of support recorded by Gallup so far. Previously, the percentage of adults supporting this measure had fluctuated between 11% and 24% over nearly thirty years of Gallup&#x27;s tracking.

Another poll conducted by Kantor, of over 28,000 Europeans in 2020, found that seven in ten people support banning the use of e-cigarettes or heated tobacco products in areas where smoking is prohibited, reflecting an increase of seven percentage points since 2017. Relative majorities also favor the other two control policies surveyed: banning flavors in e-cigarettes, with 47% support (up by 7 points since 2017), and introducing plain packaging for cigarettes, also supported by 47% (up by 1 point).

In all countries except Croatia, less than half of the respondents reported seeing people smoking inside the last time they visited a drinking establishment, such as a bar. Croatia stands out with 73% of respondents indicating this. In other countries, the proportions range from 47% in Cyprus, 45% in Slovakia, and 31% in Denmark, to only 3% in Sweden, 5% in Hungary, and 7% in Austria. These results indicate that despite the presence of indoor smoking bans across the EU, indoor tobacco smoke in drinking establishments remains an issue in several countries.

==Effects==

===Effects upon health===
Several studies have documented health and economic benefits related to smoking bans. A 2009 report by the Institute of Medicine concluded that smoking bans reduced the risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks, but the report&#x27;s authors were unable to identify the magnitude of this reduction. Also in 2009, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that bans on smoking in public places were associated with a significant reduction of incidence of heart attacks. The lead author of this meta-analysis, David Meyers, said that this review suggested that a nationwide ban on smoking in public places could prevent between 100,000 and 225,000 heart attacks in the United States each year.

A 2012 meta-analysis found that smoke-free legislation was associated with a lower rate of hospitalizations for cardiac, cerebrovascular, and respiratory diseases, and that &quot;More comprehensive laws were associated with larger changes in risk.&quot; The senior author of this meta-analysis, Stanton Glantz, told &quot;USA Today&quot; that, with respect to exemptions for certain facilities from smoking bans, &quot;The politicians who put those exemptions in are condemning people to be put into the emergency room.&quot; A 2013 review found that smoking bans were associated with &quot;significant reduction in acute MI [myocardial infarction] risk&quot;, but noted that &quot;studies with smaller population in the United States usually reported larger reductions, while larger studies reported relatively modest reductions&quot;.

A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found that smoke-free legislation was associated with approximately 10% reductions in preterm births and hospital attendance for asthma, but not with a decrease in low birth weight. A 2016 Cochrane review found that since the previous version of that review was published in 2010, the evidence that smoking bans improved health outcomes had become more robust, especially with respect to acute coronary syndrome admissions.

However, other studies came to the conclusion that smoking bans have little or no short-term effect on myocardial infarction rates and other diseases. A 2010 study from the US used huge nationally representative databases to compare smoking-restricted areas with control areas and found no associations between smoking bans and short-term declines in heart attack rates. The authors have also analyzed smaller studies using subsamples and revealed that large short-term increases in myocardial infarction incidence following a smoking ban are as common as the large decreases.

===Effects upon tobacco consumption===
Smoking bans are generally acknowledged to reduce rates of smoking; smoke-free workplaces reduce smoking rates among workers, and restrictions upon smoking in public places reduce general smoking rates through a combination of stigmatisation and reduction in the social cues for smoking. The World Health Organization considers smoking bans to have an influence on reducing demand for tobacco by producing an environment where smoking becomes increasingly more difficult and to help shift social norms away from the acceptance of smoking in everyday life. Along with tax measures, cessation measures, and education, smoking bans are viewed by public health experts as an important element in reducing smoking rates and promoting positive health outcomes. When effectively implemented, they are seen as an important element of policy to support behaviour change in favour of a healthy lifestyle. However, reports in the popular press after smoking bans have been enacted often present conflicting accounts as regards perceptions of effectiveness.

One report stated that cigarette sales in Ireland and Scotland increased after their smoking bans were implemented. In contrast, another report states that in Ireland, cigarette sales fell by 16% in the six months after implementation of the ban. In the UK, cigarette sales fell by 11% during July 2007, the first month of the nationwide smoking ban, compared with July 2006.

A 1992 document from Phillip Morris summarised the tobacco industry&#x27;s concern about the effects of smoking bans: &quot;Total prohibition of smoking in the workplace strongly effects tobacco industry volume. Smokers facing these restrictions consume 11%–15% less than average and quit at a rate that is 84% higher than average.&quot;

In the United States, the CDC reported a levelling-off of smoking rates in recent years despite a large number of ever more comprehensive smoking bans and large tax increases. It has also been suggested that a &quot;backstop&quot; of hardcore smokers has been reached: those unmotivated and increasingly defiant in the face of further legislation. The smoking ban in New York City was credited with the reduction in adult smoking rates at nearly twice the rate as in the rest of the country, &quot;and life expectancy has climbed three years in a decade&quot;.

In Sweden, use of snus, as an alternative to smoking, has risen steadily since that nation&#x27;s smoking ban.

Smoking restrictions may make it easier for smokers to quit. A survey suggests 22% of UK smokers may have considered quitting in response to that nation&#x27;s smoking ban.

Restaurant smoking restrictions may help to stop young people from becoming habitual smokers. A study of Massachusetts youths, found that those in towns with smoking bans were 35 percent less likely to be habitual smokers.

===Economic impact===
Many studies have been published in the health industry literature on the economic effect of smoking bans. The majority of these government and academic studies have found that there is no negative economic impact associated with smoking restrictions and many have found that there may be a positive effect on local businesses. A 2003 review of 97 such studies of the economic effects of a smoking ban on the hospitality industry found that the &quot;best-designed&quot; studies concluded that smoking bans did not harm businesses. Similarly, a 2014 meta-analysis found no significant gains or losses in revenue in restaurants and bars affected by smoking bans. In addition, such laws may reduce health care costs, improve work productivity, and lower the overall cost of labour in the community thus protected, making that workforce more attractive for employers.

Studies funded by the bar and restaurant associations have sometimes claimed that smoking bans have a negative effect on restaurant and bar profits. Such associations have also criticised studies which found that such legislation had no impact. Many bar and restaurant associations have relationships with the tobacco industry and are sponsored by them.

====Australia====
A government survey in Sydney found that the proportion of the population attending pubs and clubs rose after smoking was banned inside them. However, a ClubsNSW report in August 2008 blamed the smoking ban for New South Wales clubs suffering their worst fall in income ever, amounting to a decline of $385 million. Income for clubs was down 11% in New South Wales. Sydney CBD club income fell 21.7% and western Sydney clubs lost 15.5%.

====Germany====
Some smoking restrictions were introduced in German hotels, restaurants, and bars in 2008 and early 2009. The restaurant industry has claimed that some businesses in the states which restricted smoking in late 2007 (Lower Saxony, Baden-Württemberg, and Hessen) experienced reduced profits. The German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA) claimed that the smoking ban deterred people from going out for a drink or meal, stating that 15% of establishments that adopted a ban in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50%. However, a study by the University of Hamburg (Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010) finds negative impacts on revenues, if any, only in the very short run. In the medium and long run, a recovery of revenues took place. These results suggest either, that the consumption in bars and restaurants is not affected by smoking bans in the long run, or, that negative revenue impacts by smokers are compensated by increasing revenues through non-smokers.

====Ireland====
The Republic of Ireland was the first country to introduce fully smoke-free workplaces (29 March 2004, after it was delayed from 1 January 2004). The Irish workplace smoke-free law was introduced with the intention of protecting workers from secondhand smoke and to discourage smoking in a nation with a high percentage of smokers. In Ireland, the main opposition to the ban came from publicans. Many pubs introduced &quot;outdoor&quot; arrangements (generally heated areas with shelters). It was speculated by opponents that the smoke-free workplaces law would increase the amount of drinking and smoking in the home, but recent studies showed this was not the case.

Ireland&#x27;s Office of Tobacco Control website indicates that &quot;an evaluation of the official hospitality sector data shows there has been no adverse economic effect from the introduction of this measure (the March 2004 national smoking ban in bars, restaurants, etc), despite claims that the smoke-free law was a significant contributing factor to the closure of hundreds of small rural pubs, with almost 440 fewer licences renewed in 2006 than in 2005.&quot;

====United Kingdom====
Smoking bans were enacted in Scotland on 26 March 2006, in Wales on 2 April 2007, in Northern Ireland on 30 April 2007, and in England on 1 July 2007. The legislation was cited as an example of good regulation which has had a favourable impact on the UK economy by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and a review of the impact of smoke-free legislation carried out for the Department of Health concluded that there was no clear adverse impact on the hospitality industry despite initial criticism from some voices within the pub trade.

Six months after implementation in Wales, the Licensed Victuallers Association (LVA), which represents pub operators across Wales, claimed that pubs had lost up to 20% of their trade. The LVA said some businesses were on the brink of closure, others had already closed down, and there was little optimism trade would eventually return to previous levels.

The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), which represents some pubs and breweries across the UK claimed that beer sales were at their lowest level since the 1930s, ascribing a fall in sales of 7% during 2007 to the smoke-free regulations.

According to a survey conducted by pub and bar trade magazine &quot;The Publican&quot;, the anticipated increase in sales of food following introduction of smoke-free workplaces did not immediately occur. The trade magazine&#x27;s survey of 303 pubs in the United Kingdom found the average customer spent £14.86 on food and drink at dinner in 2007, virtually identical to 2006.

A survey conducted by BII (formerly British Institute of Innkeeping) and the Federation of Licensed Victuallers&#x27; Associations (FLVA) concluded that sales had decreased by 7.3% in the 5 months since the introduction of smoke-free workplaces on 1 July 2007. Of the 2,708 responses to the survey, 58% of licensees said they had seen smokers visiting less regularly, while 73% had seen their smoking customers spending less time at the pub.

====United States====

In the US, smokers and hospitality businesses initially argued that businesses would suffer from no-smoking laws. However, a 2006 review by the U.S. Surgeon General found that smoking restrictions were unlikely to harm businesses in practice, and that many restaurants and bars might see increased business.

In 2003, New York City amended its smoke-free law to include virtually all restaurants and bars, including those in private clubs, making it, along with the California smoke-free law, one of the toughest in the United States. The city&#x27;s Department of Health found in a 2004 study that air pollution levels had decreased sixfold in bars and restaurants after the restrictions went into effect, and that New Yorkers had reported less secondhand smoke in the workplace. The study also found the city&#x27;s restaurants and bars prospered despite the smoke-free law, with increases in jobs, liquor licenses, and business tax payments. The president of the New York Nightlife Association remarked that the study was not wholly representative, as by not differentiating between restaurants and nightclubs, the reform may have caused businesses like nightclubs and bars to suffer instead. A 2006 study by the New York State Department of Health found that &quot;the CIAA has not had any significant negative financial effect on restaurants and bars in either the short or the long term&quot;.

On December 19, 1990, Carl&#x27;s Jr. became the first large fast-food chain to ban smoking in all of its company-owned restaurants. On April 1, 1993, Showbiz Pizza Time Inc., owner of Chuck E. Cheese, banned smoking in its restaurants. On January 26, 1994, Arby&#x27;s Inc. announced it would ban smoking indoors in its 257 company-owned locations later that year. Dairy Queen Inc., having banned indoor smoking in company-owned locations in 1993, announced that it would urge 6,000 Dairy Queen, Orange Julius, and Karmel Korn franchise owners to put a ban on smoking inside their restaurants. On February 24, 1994, fast-food restaurant McDonald&#x27;s announced that it would ban smoking inside its 1,400 company-owned restaurants effective immediately and would &quot;continue to actively encourage our franchises to make their restaurants smoke-free, and more are voluntarily doing so every day.&quot; Taco Bell announced a similar ban on its company-owned restaurants on March 15, 1994. On December 21, 2000, Wendy&#x27;s International Inc. announced an agreement to ban smoking in its company-owned restaurants by March 31, 2001, with implemented effective dates of &quot;Jan. 1 in the West, Feb. 1 in the Southeast, March 1 in upper northern states, and March 31 in the Midwest and Northeast.&quot; On August 11, 2005, Yum! Brands, parent company of KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants, announced that it would ban smoking inside some 1,200 KFCs and 1,675 Pizza Huts that were company-owned beginning the following week and encourage the ban to its franchise operators.

In Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, three restaurants received short-term exemptions from a local smoke-free ordinance in restaurants when they managed to demonstrate financial suffering because of it.

A bar received the first hardship exemption in Washington, D.C. Maryland also has provisions for hardship exemptions.

===Effects upon musical instruments===
Bellows-driven instruments – such as the accordion, concertina, melodeon and (Irish) Uilleann bagpipes – reportedly need less frequent cleaning and maintenance as a result of the Irish smoke-free law. &quot;Third-hand smoke&quot;, solid particulates from secondhand smoke that are adsorbed onto surfaces and later re-emitted as gases or transferred through touch, are a particular problem for musicians. After playing in smoky bars, instruments can emit nicotine, 3-ethenylpyridine (3-EP), phenol, cresols, naphthalene, formaldehyde, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (including some not found in freshly-emitted tobacco smoke), which can enter musicians&#x27; bodies through the skin, or be re-emitted as gases after they have left the smoky environment. Concern about third-hand smoke on instruments is one of the reasons many musicians, represented by the New Orleans Musicians&#x27; Clinic, supported the smoking ban there.

===Effects of prison smoking restrictions===
Prisons are increasingly restricting tobacco smoking. In the United States, 24 states prohibit indoor smoking whereas California, Nebraska, Arkansas, and Kentucky prohibit smoking on the entire prison grounds. In July 2004 the Federal Bureau of Prisons adopted a smoke-free policy for its facilities. The 1993 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Helling v. McKinney&quot; acknowledged that a prisoner&#x27;s exposure to secondhand smoke could be regarded as cruel and unusual punishment (which would be in violation of the Eighth Amendment). A 1997 ruling in Massachusetts established that prison smoking bans do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Many officials view prison smoking bans as a means of reducing health-care costs.

With the exception of Quebec, all Canadian provinces have banned smoking indoors and outdoors in all their prison facilities. Prison officials and guards are sometimes worried due to previous events in other prisons concerning riots, fostering a cigarette black market within the prison, and other problems resulting from total prison smoking restrictions. Prisons have experienced riots when placing smoking restrictions into effect resulting in prisoners setting fires and destroying prison property, and persons being assaulted, injured, and stabbed. One prison in Canada had some guards reporting breathing difficulties from the fumes of prisoners smoking artificial cigarettes made from nicotine patches lit by creating sparks from inserting metal objects into electrical outlets. For example in 2008, the Orsainville Detention Centre near Quebec City, withdrew its smoke-free provision following a riot. But the feared increase in tension and violence expected in association with smoking restrictions has generally not been experienced in practice.

Prison smoking bans are also in force in New Zealand, the Isle of Man and the Australian states of Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, Northern Territory and New South Wales. The New Zealand ban was subsequently successfully challenged in court on two occasions, resulting in a law change to maintain it.

Some prisoners are getting around the prison smoking bans by producing and smoking &quot;teabacco&quot;, which is nicotine patches or lozenges mixed with tea leaves, and rolled up in Bible paper. A forensic analysis of teabacco made from nicotine lozenges identified some potentially-toxic compounds, but concluded that teabacco made from nicotine lozenges may be less harmful than traditional tobacco cigarettes.

===Compliance===

The introduction of smoking restrictions occasionally generates protests and predictions of widespread non-compliance, along with the rise of smokeasies, including in New York City, Germany, Illinois, the United Kingdom, Utah, and Washington, D.C..

High levels of compliance with smoke-free laws have been reported in most jurisdictions including New York, Ireland, Italy and Scotland. Poor compliance was reported in Calcutta.

==Criticism==
Smoke-free regulations and ordinances have been criticised on a number of grounds.

===Government interference with personal lifestyle===
Critics of smoke-free provisions, including musician Joe Jackson, and political essayist Christopher Hitchens, have claimed that regulation efforts are misguided. Typically, such arguments are based upon an interpretation of John Stuart Mill&#x27;s harm principle which perceives smoke-free laws as an obstacle to tobacco consumption per se, rather than a bar upon harming other people.

Such arguments, which usually refer to the notion of personal liberty, have themselves been criticised by Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen who defended smoke-free regulations on several grounds. Among other things, Sen argued that while a person may be free to acquire the habit of smoking, they thereby restrict their own freedom in the future given that the habit of smoking is hard to break. Sen also pointed out the heavy costs that smoking inevitably imposes on every society which grants smokers unrestricted access to public services (which, Sen noted, every society that is not &quot;monstrously unforgiving&quot; would do). Arguments which invoke the notion of personal liberty against smoke-free laws are thus incomplete and inadequate, according to Sen.

In New Zealand, two psychiatrist patients and a nurse took their local district health board to court, arguing a smoking ban at intensive care units violated &quot;human dignity&quot; as they were there for mental health reasons, not smoking-related illness. They argued it was &quot;cruel&quot; to deny patients cigarettes.

===Property rights===

Some critics of smoke-free laws emphasise the property rights of business owners, drawing a distinction between nominally public places (such as government buildings) and privately owned establishments (such as bars and restaurants). Citing economic efficiency, some economists suggest that the basic institutions of private property rights and contractual freedom are capable of resolving conflicts between the preferences of smokers and those who seek a smoke-free environment, without government intrusion.

===Legality of smoke-free regulations===
Businesses affected by smoke-free regulations have filed lawsuits claiming that these are unconstitutional or otherwise illegal. In the United States, some cite unequal protection under the law while others cite loss of business without compensation, as well as other types of challenges. Some localities where hospitality businesses filed lawsuits against the state or local government include Nevada, Montana, Iowa, Colorado, Kentucky, New York, South Carolina, and Hawaii, though none have succeeded.

===Smoke-free laws may move smoking elsewhere===
Restrictions upon smoking in offices and other enclosed public places often result in smokers going outside to smoke, frequently congregating outside doorways. This can result in non-smokers passing through these doorways getting exposed to more secondhand smoke rather than less. Many jurisdictions that have restricted smoking in enclosed public places have extended provisions to cover areas within a fixed distance of entrances to buildings.

The former UK Secretary of State for Health John Reid claimed that restrictions upon smoking in public places may lead to more people smoking at home. However, both the House of Commons Health Committee and the Royal College of Physicians disagreed, with the former finding no evidence to support Reid&#x27;s claim after studying Ireland, and the latter finding that smoke-free households increased from 22% to 37% between 1996 and 2003.

===Connection to drunk driving fatalities===
In May 2008, research published by Adams and Cotti in the &quot;Journal of Public Economics&quot; examined statistics of drunken-driving fatalities and accidents in areas where smoke-free laws have been implemented in bars and found that fatal drunken-driving accidents increased by about 13%, or about 2.5 such accidents per year for a typical county of 680,000. They speculate this could be caused by smokers driving farther away to jurisdictions without smoke-free laws or where enforcement is lax.

=== Effects of funding on research literature ===
As in other areas of research, the effect of funding on research literature has been discussed with respect to smoke-free laws. Most commonly, studies which found few or no positive and/or negative effects of smoke-free laws and which were funded by tobacco companies have been delegitimised because of the obvious conflict of interest.

Professor of Economics at the California State Polytechnic University-San Luis Obispo, Michael L. Marlow, defended &quot;tobacco-sponsored&quot; studies arguing that all studies merited &quot;scrutiny and a degree of skepticism&quot;, irrespective of their funding. He wished for the basic assumption that every author were &quot;fair minded and trustworthy, and deserves being heard out&quot; and for less attention to research funding when evaluating the results of a study. Marlow suggests that studies funded by tobacco companies are viewed and dismissed as &quot;deceitful&quot;, i.e. as being driven by (conscious) bad intention.

==Alternatives==

===Incentives for voluntarily smoke-free establishments===
During the debates over the Washington, DC, smoke-free law, city council member Carol Schwartz proposed legislation that would have enacted either a substantial tax credit for businesses that chose to voluntarily restrict smoking or a quadrupling of the annual business license fee for bars, restaurants and clubs that wished to allow smoking. Additionally, locations allowing smoking would have been required to install specified high-performance ventilation systems.

===Ventilation===
Critics of smoke-free laws have suggested that ventilation is a means of reducing the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. A tobacco industry-funded study conducted by the School of Technology of the University of Glamorgan in Wales, published in the Building Services Journal suggested that &quot;ventilation is effective in controlling the level of contamination&quot;, although &quot;ventilation can only dilute or partially displace contaminants and occupational exposure limits are based on the &#x27;as low as reasonably practicable&#x27; principle&quot;.

Some hospitality organisations have claimed that ventilation systems could bring venues into line with smoke-free restaurant ordinances. A study published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers and funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found one establishment with lower air quality in the non-smoking section, due to improperly installed ventilation systems. They also determined that even properly functioning systems &quot;are not substitutes for smoking bans in controlling environmental smoke exposure&quot;.

The tobacco industry has focused on proposing ventilation as an alternative to smoke-free laws, though this approach has not been widely adopted in the U.S. because &quot;in the end, it is simpler, cheaper, and healthier to end smoking&quot;. The Italian smoke-free law permits dedicated smoking rooms with automatic doors and smoke extractors. Nevertheless, few Italian establishments are creating smoking rooms due to the additional cost.

A landmark report from the U.S. Surgeon General found that even the use of elaborate ventilation systems and smoking rooms fail to provide protection from the health hazards of secondhand smoke, since there is &quot;no safe level of secondhand smoke&quot;.

<text>Kędzierzyn-Koźle () is a city in southern Poland, the administrative center of Kędzierzyn-Koźle County. With 58,899 inhabitants as of 2021, it is the second most-populous city in the Opole Voivodeship.

Founded from the merger of the previously separate towns of Kędzierzyn and Koźle, both dating back to the Middle Ages, the city is a major river port and center of chemical industry, and is particularly known for ZAKSA Kędzierzyn-Koźle, one of the top volleyball clubs in Europe in the 2020s.

==Geography and economy==
Kędzierzyn-Koźle is located in the historic Silesia (Upper Silesia) region at the confluence of the Oder River and its Kłodnica tributary. Situated on the lower reaches of the Gliwice Canal, it is a place of a major river port, has rail connections with all major cities of Poland and lies close to the west of the Metropolis GZM. The town is a major location of chemical industry, the site of several factories and a power plant at Blachownia Śląska. Zakłady Azotowe Kędzierzyn, a subsidiary of Grupa Azoty located in Kędzierzyn, is one of the largest chemical plants in Poland.

In 1975, the historic core Koźle on the left bank of the Oder was merged with the municipalities of Kędzierzyn, Sławięcice, and Kłodnica on the right bank, which had developed to suburbs since the 19th century industrialisation, to form present-day Kędzierzyn-Koźle.

==Etymology==
The name of the city is of Polish origin, with Kędzierzyn coming from the male name &quot;Kędziora&quot; or &quot;Kędzierzawy&quot;, and Koźle coming from the word &quot;kozioł&quot;, which means &quot;he-goat, buck&quot;. The city has a canting arms as it depicts three heads of goats.

==History==
===Koźle===
A border fortress held by a minor member of the Polish Piast dynasty was first mentioned in 1104, when it was besieged by the Přemyslid prince Svatopluk of Olomouc. The Koźle castellany was part of the Polish Duchy of Silesia since 1138, from 1172/73 of the Upper Silesian Duchy of Racibórz under the rule of the Silesian Piasts. In 1281, it was inherited by Duke Casimir of Bytom, who also called himself Duke of Koźle. Casimir soon turned to the neighbouring Kingdom of Bohemia; in 1289, he paid homage to King Wenceslaus II and received his duchy as a Bohemian fief. In 1293, he vested Koźle with town privileges, had walls erected. After Casimir was succeeded by his son Władysław in 1312, Koźle remained the capital of an autonomous duchy, ruled by the Bytom branch of the Silesian Piasts until the death of Duke Bolesław in 1355. King Charles IV adjudicated the reverted Bohemian fief to the Piast duke Konrad I of Oleśnica, whereafter the town remained a possession of the Oleśnica line until it became extinct in 1492. In 1431, Duke Konrad VII the White founded a Monastery of the Order of Friars Minor in Koźle.

Again purchased by the Opole duke Jan II the Good in 1509, the Koźle estates were ultimately incorporated into the Lands of the Bohemian Crown upon his death in 1532. Within the Habsburg monarchy, it was temporarily pawned to the Hohenzollern Margraves of Brandenburg-Ansbach. The fortress was besieged several times during the Thirty Years&#x27; War and occupied by Danish troops under the command of Duke John Ernest I of Saxe-Weimar in 1627, before they were defeated by Imperial forces under Albrecht von Wallenstein. Again conquered by a Swedish contingent led by Lennart Torstensson in 1642, the town remained almost completely devastated. In 1645, it returned to Polish rule under the House of Vasa.
Occupied by the troops of King Frederick the Great in the First Silesian War, Koźle as &quot;Cosel&quot; with the bulk of Silesia became a Prussian possession by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau. The king ordered the extension of the fortifications, nevertheless the town was occupied by Habsburg Pandurs during the Second Silesian War in 1744 and had to be reconquered by the Prussian Army two years later; the shelling again caused heavy losses and damages. The rebuilt fortress held against Austrian sieges during the Seven Years&#x27; War, even General Ernst Gideon von Laudon in 1760 had to raise his siege. In the 18th century, Cosel belonged to the tax inspection region of Neustadt (Prudnik). In 1807 the Prussian garrison withstood another besiegement by the allied Napoleonic and Bavarian forces under General Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy until a peace was made by the Treaty of Tilsit. In 1815, Cosel was incorporated into the Prussian Province of Silesia, from 1871 part of the German Empire. The development of the town was promoted by the construction of the Kłodnica Canal from the Oder port to Gliwice from 1806 until 1907. In 1903, the Polish &quot;Bank Ludowy&quot; was founded in the town.

After World War I and the Upper Silesia plebiscite of March 1921, the Polish insurgents temporarily captured the part of the town east of the Oder during the Third Silesian Uprising. In Koźle, the insurgents seized large supplies of ammunition and food, and some 1,000 railroad cars. After the uprising, however, the town remained part of Germany in the interbellum. Local Polish activists were intensively persecuted by the Germans since 1937.

During World War II, the Germans operated three forced labour subcamps (E2, E153, E155) of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp in the town. In the course of the Vistula–Oder Offensive, the Soviet Red Army from 21 January 1945 attacked the Koźle bridgehead. Afterwards, it became again part of Poland under the re-drawing of borders after World War II.

===Kędzierzyn and other districts===

Kędzierzyn was founded as a village in the 13th century, and Sławięcice was first mentioned in 13th-century documents, when both settlements were part of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland. Sławięcice even obtained town rights before 1260, but lost them in 1260, as Duke Władysław Opolski transferred them to nearby Ujazd. Sławięcice was once home to a now lost palace.

During the Third Silesian Uprising, the area was the site of heavy fighting between Polish insurgents and Germans. On May 4, 1921, the insurgents captured Sławięcice, then Blachownia Śląska and Cisowa on May 8, Kędzierzyn on May 9, and Kłodnica on May 10. Sławięcice was an essential logistical center for the insurgents for a month, with a field hospital and the headquarters of an insurgent unit. In June 1921, the Germans attacked the Polish insurgents, and recaptured Kędzierzyn. The Germans then massacred captured Polish prisoners of war in nearby Lichynia.
During World War II, the Germans operated multiple forced labour camps in the area. In Kędzierzyn there was a forced labour &quot;education&quot; camp, and three subcamps (BAB 20/E794, BAB 40/E794, E711A) of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp. In the present-day district of Blachownia Śląska there was a forced labour subcamp of the prison in Strzelce Opolskie, and four subcamps (BAB 21/E793, BAB 48/E793, E3, E714) of the Stalag VIII-B/344 camp. In the present-day district of Kłodnica, there was the E800 subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B/344 camp. In Sławięcice there was another forced labour &quot;education&quot; camp, two subcamps (E6, E207) of the Stalag VIII-B/344 camp, and a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp which operated from April 1, 1944, to January 26, 1945. In Sławięcice, there was also a crematorium for the victims of the camps, which is now a memorial. Allied prisoners of war of various nationalities, Jews, and Polish children were among the victims of the forced labour camps. In the final stages of the war, in 1945, a German-conducted death march of thousands of prisoners of several subcamps of the Auschwitz concentration camp passed through Blachownia and Koźle towards the Gross-Rosen concentration camp.

Following Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war, the region was transferred from Germany to Poland as stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement. In the years immediately following World War II, the ethnic German population was expelled, also in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The remaining Polish population was joined by Poles displaced from the eastern territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union and by 600 Poles repatriated from Lupeni, Romania.

In 1954, Blachownia and Lenartowice merged to form the Blachownia Śląska district in Sławięcice.

In 1999, the branch line connecting the city with Strzelce Opolskie closed as part of Polskie Koleje Państwowe cost-cutting.

==Sports==
The town is home to ZAKSA Kędzierzyn-Koźle, one of the most successful Polish volleyball clubs, the nine–time Polish Champion, ten–time Polish Cup winner, and three–time winner of CEV Champions League (2021, 2022, 2023).

==Transport==

There are five railway stations in the city. Kędzierzyn-Koźle is located at the intersection of National road 40 and Voivodeship roads 408, 410, 418, 423 and 426, and the A4 motorway runs nearby, just north of the city.

<text>Nysa ( or &quot;Neiße&quot;, ) is a city in southwestern Poland on the Eastern Neisse (Polish: &quot;Nysa Kłodzka&quot;) river, situated in the Opole Voivodeship. With 43,849 inhabitants (2019), it is the capital of Nysa County. It comprises the urban portion of the surrounding Gmina Nysa. Historically the city was part of Upper Silesia.

== History ==
===Medieval period===

Nysa, one of the oldest towns in Silesia, was probably founded in the 10th century. The name of the Nysa river, from which the town takes its name, was mentioned in 991, when the region formed part of the Duchy of Poland under Mieszko I of Poland. A Polish stronghold was built in Nysa in the 11th and 12th century due to the proximity of the border with the Czech Duchy. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, it became part of the Duchy of Silesia, and from the 14th century it functioned as the capital of the Duchy of Nysa, administered by the Bishopric of Wrocław. In the 12th century the Gothic Basilica of St. James and St. Agnes was built (later rebuilt after the war devastations of the 13th and 14th centuries). Now designated a Historic Monument of Poland, it is the most distinctive and most valuable landmark of Nysa. Nysa was granted town rights around 1223 by bishop Lawrence, confirmed by Duke Bolesław II Rogatka of Legnica in 1250, and attracted Flemish and German settlers. In 1241 it was ravaged by the Mongols during the first Mongol invasion of Poland. In 1245, it was granted staple right and two yearly fairs were established. In the early-14th century Nysa became an important trade- and craft-center of Poland, before it passed under the suzerainty of the Bohemian Crown in 1351, under which it remained until 1742. It also became one of the leading cultural centers of Silesia.
The town&#x27;s fortifications, dating from 1350, served to defend against the Hussites in 1424. During the Hussite Wars, in 1428 it was the site of the , with Poles and Czechs fighting on both sides. One of the prominent signs that Nysa was a significant center is the report in Nuremberg Chronicle, published in 1493, which mentions the city among the major urban centers of Central and Eastern Europe. In the description of the town population included in this chronicle we read &quot;plebs rustica polonici ydeomatis ...&quot;. The Nysa coat of arms at the entrance of the Charles Bridge in Prague, which is displayed alongside the arms of the most prominent Bohemian cities, also indicates the importance of the town.

===Modern period===
In the 16th century it was a Polish printing center.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) Nysa was besieged three times. It was plundered by the Saxons and Swedes. Polish prince (and later King) Władysław IV Vasa () visited the town several times between 1619 and 1638. In 1624 the &quot;Kolegium Carolinum Neisse&quot; (today&#x27;s &quot;I Liceum Ogólnokształcące&quot;), one of the most renowned schools of Silesia, was established as a Jesuit college. Polish King Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki and Polish prince James Louis Sobieski both attended this school.

During the First Silesian War (War of the Austrian Succession), in 1741, Nysa was besieged and captured by Prussians, King Frederick II of Prussia laid the foundations of its modern fortifications. In 1758, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, it was besieged by the Austrians. On 25 August 1769 it was the site of a meeting between Frederick II and Emperor Joseph II, co-regent in the Habsburg monarchy of Austria. Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, officer of the American Revolutionary War and French Revolution and co-author of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, was imprisoned in the town by the Prussians in 1794.
During the Napoleonic Wars Neisse was taken by the French in 1807. It retained its mostly Catholic character within the predominantly Protestant province of Silesia in the Kingdom of Prussia. Because of its many churches from the Gothic and Baroque periods the town was nicknamed &quot;the Silesian Rome&quot;. In 1816–1911, the town was the seat of the Neisse District, after which it became an independent city. During the Second Schleswig War of 1864, Prussians held Danish prisoners of war in the town, who built a road named &quot;Aleja Duńczyków&quot; (&quot;Avenue of the Danes&quot;), which is commemorated by a memorial stone. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 some 18,000 French POWs were brought to the town, however, 5,000 were soon relocated elsewhere. According to the Prussian census of 1910, the city of Neisse had a population of 25,938, of whom around 95% spoke German, 4% spoke Polish and 1% were bilingual.

===World wars and interbellum===

During World War I and the post-war Polish Silesian Uprisings, a prisoner-of-war camp was located in the town. The WWI POW camp held Russian, British, French and Romanian officers. Charles de Gaulle, future leader of French Resistance against German occupation in World War II and later president of France, was imprisoned there in 1916, and after an unsuccessful escape attempt he was deported to a POW camp in Szczuczyn. Russian POWs, still detained by the Germans after the end of the war, raised a mutiny in December 1918, to which the Germans responded with fire. Two or three Russians and a German guard were killed, 11 Russians were wounded. After World War I, Neisse became part of the new Province of Upper Silesia within Weimar Germany. Polish insurgents of the Silesian Uprisings were imprisoned in the camp before being deported to other camps.

During World War II the Germans established a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, three forced-labour camps, and several working parties of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp at Łambinowice. The city&#x27;s German population was mostly evacuated before the advancing Eastern Front, with some 2,000 mostly ill people and elders remaining. The city was conquered by the Red Army on 24 March 1945. Soviet troops then raped dozens of women, including nuns, teenage girls and elderly women, murdered 27 nuns and six monks, and set fire to an old people&#x27;s home with the elderly locked inside.

The town was placed preliminarily under Polish administration in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and renamed to the historic Polish &quot;Nysa&quot;. The remaining German population of Nysa was expelled. Expulsions started in mid-June 1945, carried out by the Soviet-organized Polish militia who surrounded settlements, entered homes, and asked their inhabitants to leave their home with them. In the following years, new Polish settlers, some whom were themselves expelled or resettled from what is now western Ukraine (see: Kresy), made Nysa their new home.

After the war, Polish troops were stationed in Nysa until 2001, when they were relocated to Kłodzko.

===Nysa&#x27;s monuments===
As a result of destruction during World War II, in particular the heavy fighting of the Vistula–Oder Offensive and the Lower Silesian offensive of early 1945, during which the Red Army pushed the German Army Group A out of southwest Poland and the adjacent German Lower Silesia, the historic aspect of the town has only partially been preserved due to wartime destruction. After Polish takeover of the town, hundreds of historic burgher houses deemed reconstructable were struck down in line with the Communist&#x27;s ideological goals of degermanization and struggle against the bourgeoisie as well as to provide material for the re-building of Warsaw. The most important monuments have been rebuilt.

==Economy==

Until recently, Nysa was a major industrial centre in the Opole Voivodeship. The town was home to metal works, machinery production, agricultural produce and construction materials. The year 2002 saw the closure of the ZSD company. The company constructed delivery vehicles, namely the ZSD Nysa, FSO Polonez and, until recently, the Citroën C15 and Berlingo. Currently, the factory remains closed.

Recently, the Wałbrzych Special Economic Zone is located by Dubois Street (&quot;ul. Dubois&quot;) and Karpacka Street (&quot;ul. Karpacka&quot;), largely revolving around agricultural goods and produce, as well as metal works.

<text>Brzeg (; Latin: &quot;Alta Ripa&quot;, German: &quot;Brieg&quot;, Silesian German: &quot;Brigg&quot;, , ) is a town in southwestern Poland with 34,778 inhabitants (December 2021) and the capital of Brzeg County. It is situated in Silesia in the Opole Voivodeship on the left bank of the Oder river.

The town of Brzeg was first mentioned as a trading and fishing settlement within fragmented Piast-ruled Poland in 1234. In 1248, Silesian Duke Henry III the White granted the settlement Magdeburg town rights and by the late 13th century the city became fortified. Sometimes referred to as &quot;the garden town&quot;, the town&#x27;s size greatly expanded after the construction of dwelling houses which were located on the city outskirts. From the early 14th to late 17th centuries, the town was ruled by the Piast dynasty as fiefs of the Bohemian Crown within the Holy Roman Empire. Later, as the result of the Silesian Wars, the town passed to Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was also part of Germany, before it became again part of Poland after World War II.

==Etymology==
In older documents, Brzeg was referred to as &quot;Civitas Altae Ripae&quot;, meaning &#x27;city on the high banks&#x27; of the Oder River; its name is derived from Polish &quot;brzeg&quot; &#x27;shore&#x27;. 
 (1841–1895), in his book of the etymology of Silesian localities, states that in a Latin document from 1234 the settlement&#x27;s name was &quot;Visoke breg&quot; (, ; literally &#x27;high bank&#x27;).

A native or resident of Brzeg is known as a &quot;brzeżan&quot;, &quot;brzeżanin&quot; (male), &quot;brzeżanka&quot; (female), &quot;brzeżanie&quot; and &quot;brzeżaninie&quot; (plural).

==History==
===Prehistory===

The locality in and around present-day Brzeg has been settled by people since the Mesolithic era, with the earliest signs of settlement between 8000 and 4200 BC, as concluded from archaeological findings in Myślibórz, Kościerzyce, Lubsza and Lipki. The early human populace left behind traces of lithic flakes, flint flakes and other flint related tools. The earliest signs of agriculture come around during the Neolithic Era (4200–1700 BC). The Neolithic culture developed agriculture and domesticated farm animals; this lifestyle led Nomadic cultures to settle in the locality. The era saw the development of weaving, pottery and mining in the Brzeg Plain, with archaeological finds in Brzeg, Buszyce, Prędocin, Lewin Brzeski, Małujowice, Lipki, Myśliborze, Mąkoszyce and Obórki.

The time period of 1300–700 BC bears the existence of the Lusatian culture of the late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age. The culture settled in the region and in large continued to develop agriculture and the domestication of farm animals. The natural economy of the culture was based on weaving, pottery and metal works. The Lusatian culture&#x27;s populace that inhabited the Brzeg Lands was identified by archaeological excavations, revealing 17 individual localities, including 3 hamlets and 8 burial sites, namely a fortified wooden settlement in Rybna and an open-pit crematory in Pisarzowice (with 30 discovered burial sites).

To follow the Lusatian culture, which witnessed its decline around 500 BC, were the Celts, around 400–300 BC in Silesia, as identified with archaeological findings in Lubsza and Pawłów (located in the eastern vicinity of Brzeg). Around 100 BC, the peoples of Silesia (Celtic and Germanic tribes) began trading with the Roman Empire, as evidenced through the findings of Roman currency in the locality. In the 7th century Slavic peoples started settling in the region. At the same time Iron tools and blacksmith-based hamlets found in Kantorowice and Pępice are evidenced for the first time in this region.

===Early Middle Ages===
The period of AD 500–1000 saw the establishment of the early feudal system in Silesia. The era was characteristic of the establishment of gord settlements, towns and the continued development of trade and crafts. It is believed the permanent populace around modern-day Brzeg was set up by Silesian tribes. The first mention of the Silesian tribes is made in the mid-ninth-century document known as the Bavarian Geographer (), which included the Silesian gord of Ryczyn, located north-west of Brzeg, in the eastern Oława County. The Ryczyn gords became the main line of defence for the Silesians, namely to protect the river trade routes along the Oder river and the land trade route between Ryczyn (the locality&#x27;s administrative centre, home to a castellan) and Brzeg (being some in length). The importance of the Ryczyn gords is demonstrated by Henry V of the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s army halting their advancement before the gords in 1109.

Between the ninth and early-tenth century, the Brzeg Lands, together with all of Silesia, were part of Great Moravia until its demise in AD 906, after which, until 990 the region was under the rule of the Premyslids.

===Medieval Poland===
Around 990, Silesia was incorporated into Mieszko I&#x27;s Poland. During the Fragmentation of Poland (1138 – ), the area of the Brzeg Lands, along with the rest of Silesia, came under the control of King of Poland, Bolesław III Wrymouth&#x27;s oldest son, Władysław II the Exile.

The most favourable area for the settlement of Brzeg is located between the Castle Square (&quot;Plac Zamkowy&quot;), with elevated ground extending south-east towards the Square of the American Polonia (&quot;Plac Polonii Amerykańskiej&quot;). Before the town&#x27;s foundation, three separate settlements existed in its modern-day territory, with &quot;Wysoki Brzeg&quot; (&quot;Alta ripa&quot;) bearing the main administrative role in the region. Between the late-twelfth and early-thirteen century, the Dukes of Wrocław set up a curia, led by a claviger. In 1235, Henry the Bearded occupied the area around Oława, by which Walloons had to turn over a tribute of 1 scale of grain and of oat to the settlement of Brzeg, suggesting the existence of a granary and other outbuildings in the curia&#x27;s established headquarters.

Some two hundred m south-west from the curia was the former location, on what was later to be called Mary&#x27;s Hill (&quot;Góra Marii&quot;), of the Romanesque St. Mary&#x27;s Church (&quot;Kościół Najświętszej Marii Panny&quot;). During the Reformation, the church was deconstructed, and its brickwork used for the construction of the town&#x27;s fortifications. A sixteenth-century chronicle states it was &quot;the first church&quot;, however, no more is known about the holy site. Historians believe the founder of the church may have been Bolesław I the Tall or Henry the Bearded. Around the peripheries of the settlement was the location of several hospital buildings. Towards the route to Wrocław in the town&#x27;s west was the location of the Hospital of the Holy Ghost (&quot;Świętego Ducha&quot;), used both to cure the town&#x27;s dwellers and as an inn for travellers along the Wrocław-Opole route the town of Brzeg was located in the middle of, with an average walking distance between each town taking one day. The area around the Holy Ghost Hospital, present-day Moniuszko Square (&quot;Plac Moniuszki&quot;), was the location of a major market, positioned by the cross roads of the Wrocław–Nysa route, east of the Wrocławska Gate. By the end of the thirteenth century, the Duke of Brzeg possessed 10 shambles. The market is believed to be characteristic of other Silesian towns, commonly selling agricultural produce, namely bread, meat and shoes. Prior to the locality receiving its town charter in 1248 or 1250, the settlement had characteristics of a town and not of an ordinary fishing village, being referred to as &quot;civitas&quot; in an early Latin document, as exemplified by the existence of the curia, church and a major market, allowing the settlement to develop through the exchange of produce and barter.

Prior to Brzeg receiving its town charter, the Duke of Wrocław, Henry III the White, received the settlement of Małkowice, (present-day Kępa Młyńska), in exchange of his feudal rights over Zębice (south-west from Oława). The fishermen living in Małkowice (present-day &quot;ul. Rybacka&quot;), in accordance to ancient Polish law were charged with the task of protecting the Ducal Castle along the riverside. By the turn of the thirteenth century, the defenceless populace living in the pastures of the Brzeg Plain began to relocate into the fortified &quot;Visoke breg&quot;, building up a new osiedle around the present-day streets of: &quot;Łokietka&quot;, &quot;Piastowska&quot; and &quot;Trzech Kotwic&quot; (extending south-east). The osiedle was documented as &quot;Stary Brzeg&quot; (&quot;Antiqua Brega&quot;; &quot;Alt Brieg&quot;), to be renamed Wieś Brzeska: Brygischedorf (c. 1329) and &quot;villa Bregensis&quot; in 1339. To the west of the fortified centre of Brzeg, the settlement of Rataje (a separate village until 1975) as the former village&#x27;s etymology suggests, centered around the upkeep of the ducal pastures.
The town received German town law in 1250 from the Wrocław Duke Henry III the White. The foundation was carried out by the three lokators, Gerkinus of Złotoryja, Ortlif and Heinrich of Reichenbach (Dzierżoniów). From the emblem of Heinrich of Reichenbach the town also got its coat of arms. While in power, Henry III, granted the town (by a singular payment) the forest around the locality of Lubsza. His successor, Henryk IV the Righteous regulated the town&#x27;s church affairs, as well as renouncing his patronage over St. Mary&#x27;s Church (&quot;Kościół Św. Marii Panny&quot;), located west of the town&#x27;s western boundary. The church was granted to the Order of Saint John, subsequently founding the Church of St. Nicholas in 1292. The town was fortified in 1297.

From 1311 to 1675 Brzeg was the capital of a Lower Silesian duchy (Duchy of Brzeg) ruled by a local line of the Polish Piast dynasty, one of whom built a castle in 1341. The Duchy became a fief of the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1329. The town was burned by the Hussites in 1428 and soon afterwards rebuilt.

===Early modern period===

At the beginning of the 16th century there were two schools in Brzeg, a collegiate and a municipal school, both influenced by the scientific, cultural and literary currents of the University of Kraków. In 1529 Duke Frederick II of Legnica, in attempt to establish the town as a significant learning center, merged the two schools, but the town council, wanting to maintain control over the municipal school, led to the two being split again in 1534.

The town continued to flourish under the reign of Duke George II. George II maintained close contacts with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and its nobility, and rebuilt the Ducal Castle in Renaissance style, built the Renaissance town hall, established a new mausoleum of the Piast dukes and built a new gymnasium, opened in 1569. The libraries of the old schools were merged into the newly named Piast Library. The gymnasium became popular among Polish nobility, whose children were often educated there. Among the graduates were Polish Royal secretary and poet and reformer Samuel Hartlib, co-founder of the Royal Society of London.

In 1595 Brzeg was again fortified by Joachim Frederick of Brzeg and Legnica. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War it suffered greatly; in the War of the Austrian Succession it was heavily bombarded by the Prussian forces; and in 1807 it was captured by Napoleon&#x27;s army. When Bohemia fell to the Habsburg monarchy of Austria in 1526, the town fell under the overlordship of the Habsburgs in their roles of Kings of Bohemia, although it was still ruled locally by the Silesian Piasts. Upon the extinction of the last duke George William of Legnica in 1675, Brieg came under the direct rule of the Habsburgs.

===Late modern and contemporary===

In 1537 Duke Frederick II of Legnica concluded a treaty with Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg, whereby the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg would inherit the duchy upon the extinction of the Silesian Piasts. On the death of George William the last duke in 1675, however, Austria refused to acknowledge the validity of the treaty and annexed the duchies and Frederick the Great of the Kingdom of Prussia used this treaty to justify his claim at the invasion of Silesia during the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740. Brieg and most of Silesia were annexed by Prussia in 1741 during the First Silesian War. In 1807 the town&#x27;s fortifications were pulled down by Napoleon&#x27;s army. The Prussian Province of Silesia, and thus Brieg, consequently became part of the German Empire when it was proclaimed in 1871 on the unification of Germany. Despite Austrian, Prussian and German rule, the town was an important Polish printing center in the region.

During World War II, the Germans operated two Nazi prisons with three forced labour subcamps in the town and a fourth subcamp in Bielawa. In early 1945, some prisoners were sent on a death march to Kłodzko. 202 Polish citizens were murdered by Nazi Germany in the town during the war. During the war, 60% of Brieg was destroyed and many of the town&#x27;s inhabitants died during the severe winter of 1944–5 as they fled from the advancing Red Army. The war had brought the most severe destruction to the town in its entire history. Some of the town&#x27;s population was evacuated by the German Army who moved its population further west inside Germany for safety and declared Brieg a fortress. After the fall of the town to the Soviets the remaining German population were later expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The town, under the historic Polish name &quot;Brzeg&quot; became again part of Poland and was repopulated by Poles whom Soviets expelled from the eastern part of interwar Poland.

=== Traditional Garrison Town ===

From the late 19th century the then German town of Brieg had expanded into a traditional military garrison town, from 1897 until 1919 it was the home town base to Infantry Regiment No. 157 designated from 1902 the 4th Silesian Infantry Regiment No. 157 (&quot;4. Schlesisches Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 157&quot;) of the Royal Prussian Army and respectively the Imperial German Army. In 1914 under the regiment&#x27;s last peacetime commander Lieutenant General Paul Tiede the regiment began mobilizing for the Western Front at the outbreak of World War I as part of VI Army Corps (&quot;VI. Armee-Korps&quot;), 12th Division (&quot;12. Division&quot;), 78th Infantry Brigade (&quot;78. Infanterie-Brigade&quot;).

At the end of World War I the garrison barracks at Brieg remained for some years after without a stationed military regiment. The Imperial German Army Air Arm (&quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;) military aerodrome (&quot;Fliegerhorst&quot;) found in nearby &quot;Grüningen&quot; was furthermore dismantled and destroyed as part of the Treaty of Versailles. It was not until 4 August 1930 that the 5th Squadron of Cavalry Regiment No. 8 (&quot;5. Schwadron Reiterregiments Nr. 8&quot;) of the German Reichswehr arrived in Brieg from Breslau-Carlowitz, other cavalry squadrons from Militsch and Oels followed shortly after. This resulted in the garrison&#x27;s Tiede-Barracks (named after &quot;Generalleutnant Paul Tiede&quot;) located in &quot;Moltke-, Sedan-, Roon- und Bismarckstraße&quot; requiring some alterations to accommodate the new arrival of horse-cavalry residents. It was from Brieg garrison, the German Cavalry Captain (&quot;Rittmeister&quot;) Konrad Freiherr von Wangenheim became famous for securing a Gold medal win at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin for the German equestrian team whilst suffering from a broken collarbone. In 1933 an airfield located in nearby &quot;Hermsdorf&quot; was also built and thereby a much larger military aerodrome was established. The new aerodrome was occupied by Flight Reconnaissance Group 113 (&quot;Fliegeraufklärungsgruppe 113&quot;).

Towards the end of World War II, on 6 February 1945, the Soviet army captured Brzeg, which resulted in moderate destruction of the town&#x27;s buildings and infrastructure. After Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war, Brzeg became part of Poland. Since 1950 the reconstructed town has been a part of the Opole Voivodeship.

===History of the Jewish population===
As the town was situated on the commercial route to Wrocław, in which a colony of Jews had long resided, Jews settled there about 1324. The Jewish community of Brzeg had its separate place of worship from early times. In 1358 Jews lent money to local noblemen and the duke of Brzeg, Ludwig I, who granted the Jews freedom of movement in the duchy in that year. In the 14th century the Jews of Brieg were persecuted on account of their usurious practices; one outbreak of such violence occurred in 1362. In 1392 it was claimed that all debts of the duke had been discharged by the payments to a Jew of Brzeg (Jacob, the son of Moses), of a certificate of indebtedness. In 1398 the Brzeg Jews bought a letter of protection from the duke, whereby they were guaranteed the peaceful possession of their privileges. But in 1401 they were driven from the city, except Jacob and Seman von Reichenbach, who had received a patent of protection from the duke&#x27;s council for six years from May 1, 1399. In 1423, duke Ludwig II granted the Jews rights of residence on payment of an annual tax of 20 gulden, but they were expelled from the duchies of Brieg and Liegnitz in 1453 as a result of the inflammatory preachings of the Franciscan John Capistrano. Solomo, a capitalist, lent large sums of money to royal houses in the 15th century. In the 16th century, one of the local Jews served as a physician to the duke of Brieg.

With the decline of Wrocław as a trade center, the Jews of Brieg became little more than an isolated community; and in modern times they shared the lot of the other Silesian Jews. They carried on insignificant trade operations as a rule. The conquest of Silesia by Frederick the Great brought but slight change in their condition.

A synagogue was built in Brieg in 1799, and a rabbi was first appointed in 1816. The Jewish population numbered 156 in 1785; 376 in 1843; 282 in 1913; 255 in 1933; and 123 in 1939. In the Kristallnacht pogroms of 1938 under Nazi Germany the interior of the synagogue was completely demolished and the Torah scrolls publicly burned; numerous shops were ransacked. During World War II, from 1940 to 1944, the Germans operated a forced labour camp for Jewish men in the town. The community was not reestablished after the Holocaust.

==Geography==
===Status===
The shape of the town, including its neighbouring &quot;osiedla&quot;, is comparable to that of a deformed rectangle, elongated north-south and west-east. The area of the town, including the village of Rataje, which was incorporated into Brzeg on January 1, 1973, is some . In comparison to Opole, with a total area of ; Nysa&#x27;s and Kędzierzyn-Koźle&#x27;s ; Brzeg is ranked fourth in the Opole Voivodeship by both population and area.

===Topography===

Brzeg, as the regional capital of Brzeg County (&quot;Powiat Brzeski&quot;), is located in the west of the Opole Voivodeship, in the south-east of Poland. The settlement is located in the valley of the Oder, located between Opole 38.5 km to its east and Wrocław, to its north-west. The town has a predominantly flat relief (in comparison to the river scarp on the eastern bank of the river). The River Oder, at low water levels (predominantly between June and early September) forms eyots north of Jerzynowa, Kępa and Srebrna Islands. The locality is located in the Brzeg Plain (&quot;Rownina Brzeska&quot;), part of the Silesian Lowlands. The Brzeg Plain&#x27;s boundaries are outlined by the Oder river to its north, the Nysa Kłodzka Valley to its south-east, the hillocks of Grodków Hills and the Wawrzyszów Hills to its south. The western boundary of the Brzeg Plain is marked by the Oława Valley, along the Oder&#x27;s mid-course.

The Brzeg Plain was formed by the Riss glaciation period (347,000 to 128,000 years ago), leaving behind remnants of a ground moraine from the last glacial period. The ground moraines have left two equally small hills, bearing characteristics of kames. The kames form the Łosiów Range (&quot;Wał Łosiowski&quot;), between the confluence of the River Nysa Kłodzka and the Oława Valley. Small streams, having their sources around the range, are fed directly into the Oder in the region of Nysa Kłodzka and Oława. The clearing&#x27;s characteristics set it as a point for defence in the Lower Silesia region, lined with barrages made out of cut down woodland. The Brzeg Plain was settled due to its fertile soil, allowing for the earliest forms of agriculture to develop in the locality. The locality was first settled by Silesian tribes and in later history, until 1675, by the Piast duchies of Duchy of Brzeg, Legnica and Wołów, united under the Duchy of Legnica-Wołów-Brzeg. Presently, the region is spotted with numerous towns, including Brzeg, Grodków and Strzelin, as well as villages, with agriculture providing the major source of income. The development of agriculture is met with a lack of forested areas, apart from the Stobrawa Landscape Park, located 7.2 km to the north of Brzeg and the Oder river. The Stobrawa woodland, agriculture and the Oder (as a form of transport) provided Brzeg the necessary diversity to remain the regional trade capital in Silesia.

Brzeg&#x27;s geographical position between two trade routes, running from west to east (Legnica–Opole) and north to south (Gniezno–Nysa) and further on into the Kingdom of Bohemia, additionally stimulated the town&#x27;s demographic and economic expansion. Brzeg is in modern times located between the European route E67 and E40.

==Environment==

Brzeg has five public parks, three of which encircle the Old Town (&quot;Stare Miasto&quot;), after the area was transformed into parkland with the deconstruction of the garrison town&#x27;s fortifications during the Napoleonic Wars in 1807. The parkland, surrounding the Old Town to its south, became known as the &quot;Planty&quot;. The &quot;Planty&quot; constitute of the Central Park of J. Czajkowski (&quot;Park Centralny im. J. Czajkowskiego&quot;), with a total area of 6.1 ha. The Central Park contains an artificial lake and a stream, connecting its waters to the western portion of the &quot;Planty&quot;, the &quot;Park nad Fosą&quot;. The Park by the Moat (&quot;Park nad Fosą&quot;), with a total area of 3.7 ha, is located south of the Silesian Piasts&#x27; Castle. The third and largest by area parkland surrounding the Old Town is located by the Oder river, the Odranian Park (&quot;Park Nadodrzański&quot;), with a total area of 10.9 ha. The castle, together with the town&#x27;s fortification remnants, the Odrzańska Gate is located in the park.

The largest parkland in Brzeg, located in the south-west of the town is the Park of Juliusz Peppel (Park im. Juliusza Peppela) and formerly Liberty Park (&quot;Park Wolności&quot;) having a total area of 68.8 ha. The parkland was established after donations from the owners of Skarbimierz and the landed-elite family von Lobbecke donated the area to the town&#x27;s authorities, to make way for a landscape park in the area. The smallest of the five public parks in Brzeg is the &quot;Park Ptasi&quot;, located in the south of the town, west of the osiedle of Westerplatte. The park has a total area of 1 ha.

==Demography==
===History===
Since the Early Middle Ages, the territory was inhabited by Polish tribes. Later on, it experienced both German colonisation and Germanisation policies towards the indigenous Poles. According to the Prussian census of 1905, the city of Brieg had a population of 27,486, of which 93% spoke German, 6% spoke Polish, and 1% were bilingual. After World War II, the town of Brzeg was part of the population transfers of the Soviet and Polish People&#x27;s Republic&#x27;s campaign to resettle Poles from Kresy (annexed by the USSR) to the newly regained territories by Poland from the defeated Germany, as part of the Potsdam Agreement. Per the agreement, the German population of Brzeg was expelled to either West or East Germany. The newly arrived population in Brzeg predominantly came from the countryside, being former peasants. The integration of the residents came in phases: education, communal work, marriages and the provision of material goods and items left behind by the former populace. By 1975, 37.9% of the population of Brzeg had settled in the town after 1960.

<text>Kluczbork (, ) is a town in southern Poland with 23,554 inhabitants (2019), situated in the Opole Voivodeship. It is the capital of Kluczbork County and an important railroad junction.

In Kluczbork the major rail line from Katowice splits into two directions – westwards to Wrocław and northwards to Poznań. It is also connected with Fosowskie.

==History==
Archaeologists have determined that a settlement existed at the location of present-day Kluczbork by 1000–800 BCE. The Germanic Sciri and Bastarnae settled in the vicinity, and were followed c. 100 BCE by Celts and various Germanic tribes, including Silingi and Vandals. The latter left Silesia c. 400 and West Slavs came to the region in the 7th century (see Silesians). In the late 10th century the Silesian territory was included in the emerging Polish state by its first historic ruler Mieszko I.

In the 13th century the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star acquired territory in Silesia, including the villages of Młodoszów, Kuniów, and Chocianowice. The Knights built a settlement on 2 November 1252 . Named Cruceburg (later spelled Creutzburg, Creuzburg, Kreuzburg), it received Magdeburg rights on 26 February 1253, now accepted as the official date of the town&#x27;s foundation. The Knights adjudicated in the town until 1274, when it started to be administered by a vogt of local Silesian dukes and juries were introduced. As a result of the dynastic fragmentation of Poland, Kluczbork was part of various Polish duchies ruled by the Piast dynasty: Duchy of Silesia until 1293, Duchy of Głogów until 1312, Duchy of Oleśnica until 1323 and Duchy of Legnica until 1341, when it came under direct rule of the King of Poland, Casimir III the Great. In 1356 it passed to the Czech Crown, and continued to belong to various duchies ruled by the Piast dynasty. From 1536 it was part of the Piast-ruled Duchy of Brzeg until its dissolution in 1675. Afterwards it was incorporated into the Habsburg monarchy, as part of the Habsburg-ruled Czech Kingdom.
A mint operated in Kluczbork during the reign of Duke Bolesław III the Generous, in the early 14th century. In 1426 Duke Louis II of Brzeg granted Kluczbork privileges of a salt market. For centuries the town was inhabited by a predominantly Polish-speaking populace. The textile industry began to grow in importance in 1553, but suffered a fire in 1569. Another great fire destroyed many houses on 8 December 1562. On 25 January 1588, the day after the Battle of Byczyna, Polish troops under Jan Zamoyski plundered the city. The townspeople accepted the Protestant Reformation in 1656 and converted the local Roman Catholic Church into a Lutheran one. The Polish Brethren settled in the city after 1660, and organized their synods in the city in 1663 and 1668. The town had a population of approximately 1,000 in 1681.

A fire on 23 April 1737 almost completely destroyed the town, leaving only a few houses and the castle unscathed. Several years of rebuilding passed before it reached its previous size.

In the 18th century Kreuzburg was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1741 during the Silesian Wars and became part of the Prussian Province of Silesia. Under Prussian rule the town and the region saw a large influx of German-speaking settlers.

The town became part of the German Empire upon the unification of Germany in 1871. It had a predominantly German-speaking population of 5,238 in 1875, although it was located in a Polish-dominated district. The population grew to 8,750 by 1895 and 10,236 by 1900.

Following the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, Kreuzburg was involved in the Upper Silesian referendum in 1921. 95.6% (37,957 votes out of 39,703 participants) voted to remain within Weimar Germany instead of joining the Second Polish Republic. It became part of the Province of Upper Silesia; to differentiate between other places named Kreuzburg, it was known as &quot;Kreuzburg O.S.&quot; (referring to &quot;Oberschlesien&quot;, or Upper Silesia). By 1939 the town was the seat of Landkreis Kreuzburg O.S. and had 11,693 inhabitants. After the Nazi Party took power in Germany in the 1930s, anti-Polish and anti-Jewish sentiments became more visible. In 1936, the Germans changed the Polish-sounding street names, and in 1938, during the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; they burned down the synagogue, built in 1886. Local Polish leader Paweł Widera was arrested in May 1939.

During World War II, in 1939, the Germans established the Oflag VIII-A prisoner-of-war camp initially for Polish and later for French officers. In 1942, it was dissolved and the POWs were relocated to the Oflag VIII-F POW camp in Moravská Třebová in German-occupied Czechoslovakia. In 1943, the Germans founded the Ilag VIII/Z camp for interned citizens of the United Kingdom and the United States. The Germans evacuated the populace before the advancing Soviet army in January 1945 to then German-speaking parts of Bohemia. In January 1945, sick POWs from the Stalag Luft 7 were moved to Ilag VIII/Z, whereas the remaining POWs passed through the town in a German-perpetrated death march. The town was captured by the Soviet Union&#x27;s Red Army on 20 January 1945 toward the end of the war. After German surrender, the German population returned.

Following the war in 1945, the town became part of Poland. In July 1945, the Polish administration issued a decree that all Germans are to wear on their clothing a discriminatory mark with &quot;N&quot; on white background. In the following, the German native population was expelled.

Between 1975–1998, the town was administratively part of the former Opole Voivodeship. A monument of Jan Dzierżon, pioneering and world-famous Polish apiarist, was unveiled in 1981.

==Economy==
Kluczbork&#x27;s economy is dominated by the production of machinery, knitwear and construction material, alongside newly emerging industries, namely: the transport sector, trade, agriculture and the food production sector as well as being the centre for the Kluczbork County&#x27;s banks and other financial institutions. The Gmina Kluczbork has some 1800 businesses (1300 of which are located within the city&#x27;s boundaries). The largest factories in Kluczbork are: Fabryka Maszyn i Urządzeń „Famak” (machinery production), PV „Prefabet - Kluczbork” S.A. (concrete materials) and Wagrem sp. z o.o. Kluczbork (weighing scale repairs).

The part of the town of Kluczbork, around Ligota Dolna, is part of the Wałbrzych Special Economic Zone (area of 53939 ha). The current investors in the Wałbrzych Special Economic Zone are: Marcegaglia Poland, Inpol-Krak Tubes Service Center and the German Seppeler Gruppe Ocynkownia Śląsk (galvanisation company).

<text>Prudnik (, , , ) is a town in southern Poland, located in the southern part of Opole Voivodeship near the border with the Czech Republic. It is the administrative seat of Prudnik County and Gmina Prudnik. Its population numbers 21,368 inhabitants (2016). Since 2015, Prudnik is a member of the Cittaslow International.

The town was founded in the 1250s, and was historically part of the Polish-ruled Duchy of Opole, and afterwards was located within the Habsburg monarchy, Poland, Habsburg monarchy again, Prussia, Germany, and eventually Poland again. It was once an important industrial hub known for its shoe-making traditions and more recently towel making by the ZPB &quot;Frotex&quot; Company, one of the largest towel manufacturers in Europe. The town also possesses numerous architectural monuments and historic buildings such as the Main Town Hall and &quot;Wok&#x27;s Tower&quot; (&quot;Wieża Woka&quot;) from the 13th-century.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Prudnik&quot; was created after the Polish word &quot;prąd&quot; (flow, stream, Czech: &quot;proud&quot;, Silesian: &quot;prōnd&quot;), similarly to the nearby villages of Prężyna and Prężynka, and means a river with a fast stream. In the Middle Ages, the town&#x27;s name was written with a letter &quot;u&quot;, which was a Czech counterpart of &quot;ą&quot; (1262 &quot;Pruthenos&quot;, 1331 &quot;Prudnik&quot;). Since the 17th century, the name &quot;Prudnik&quot; was used alongside the German name &quot;Neustadt&quot;.

The town&#x27;s German name was also written in its Latin form – &quot;Neostadium&quot;. Its occasionally used Polish and Czech translations were: &quot;Nowe Miasto&quot; and &quot;Nové Město&quot;. The town&#x27;s older name also had its Latin form – &quot;Prudnicium&quot;. The town was also called &quot;Polnisch Neustadt&quot; (&quot;Polish New Town&quot;), but in 1708 it got replaced with &quot;Königliche Stadt Neustadt&quot; (&quot;Royal Town New Town&quot;). Its Polish counterpart, &quot;Nowe Miasto Królewskie&quot;, was used in a Polish document published in 1750 by Frederick the Great.

In the 19th century, the town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Neustadt in Oberschlesien&quot; (&quot;New Town in Upper Silesia&quot;), while the Slavic name &quot;Prudnik&quot; was still used by its Polish inhabitants, which was mentioned in Upper Silesia&#x27;s topographical description from 1865: &quot;&quot;Der ursprünglische Stadtname &quot;Prudnik&quot; ist noch jetz bei den polnischen Landbewohnern üblich&quot;&quot;. In the alphabetic list of cities of Silesia published by Johann Knie in Wrocław in 1830, Polish name &quot;Prudnik&quot; was used along with German &quot;Neustadt&quot; (&quot;Prudnik, polnische Benennung der Kreistadt Neustadt&quot;).

In Polish publications since the 20th century, the town&#x27;s name was written as &quot;Prądnik&quot;. This name was also used formally in 1945. The town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Prudnik&quot; on 7 May 1946.

In Polish, the town&#x27;s name has masculine grammatical gender.

== History ==

=== Prehistory and the ancient times ===
Traces of human presence in the area of the present-day town of Prudnik, confirmed by archaeological research, date back to the Paleolithic era. The oldest settlements near Prudnik were formed by groups of hunters who exploited the surrounding flint deposits. Their products, found during excavations, are typical of the Acheulean culture, from the interglacial era. The local population of early Slavs held trade contacts with Rome, as documented by Roman coins found in Prudnik dating back to 700 BC–1250 AD. On a hill by the Złoty Potok river, in the western part of town, the remains of a warrior of the Germanic Vandals tribe, who died in the 4th century AD, were excavated.

=== Middle Ages ===
The area of present-day Prudnik was located at the borderlands between the local West Slavic tribes of Golensizi and Opolans. The earliest written information regarding settlements near Prudnik were included in the 1233 will of a Silesian nobleman Johannes Sibote, the owner of nearby villages of Jasiona, Skrzypiec, Krzyżkowice, Czyżowice and Lubrza. In 1253, the area was captured by the Czechs during a revenge campaign for the invasion of Opavian Silesia by Polish dukes Vladislaus I of Opole and Bolesław V the Chaste.

In the Autumn of 1255, King Ottokar II of Bohemia instructed Vok of Rosenberg to help new settlers move into the borderland. Between 6 November and the middle of December of that year, Vok founded the Wogendrüssel castle in the defensive bend of the Prudnik river. The castle controlled the trade route between Nysa and Opava. The foundation of the castle in this place is equivalent to the foundation of Prudnik as a settlement. Prudnik was the northernmost stronghold of the Kingdom of Bohemia.

Vok&#x27;s son, Henry I of Rosenberg, obtained Magdeburg rights for the town in 1279. After Henry&#x27;s death, Prudnik was passed over to knight Jaxa de Snelwald. Prudnik belonged to the historical region of Moravia until 1337, when the town became a part of the Duchy of Opole in the Upper Silesia region, and remained under the rule of local Polish dukes of the Piast dynasty until the dissolution of the duchy in 1532, when it was incorporated into the Austrian-ruled Bohemian (Czech) Crown. It was located on a trade route between Wrocław and Vienna.

In 1373, the town suffered a plague epidemic. Several residents survived the epidemic by escaping into the nearby Opawskie Mountains. Having returned to Prudnik, they burned down most of the buildings and started the process of rebuilding the town. The oldest known form of Prudnik&#x27;s coat of arms comes from a 1399 wax seal.

During the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War, a knight known as Maćko of Prudnik (Maczke von der Neuwidnstadt) fought in the Battle of Grunwald on 15 July 1410 alongside Polish troops. After the death of late Duke Vladislaus II&#x27;s wife, brothers Bernard of Niemodlin and Bolko IV of Opole took over the area of Prudnik and Głogówek. The rule of the area was later passed over to Bolko IV&#x27;s son, Bolko V the Hussite. The first written mention of Bolko V as the ruler of Prudnik is dated 6 May 1425. Bolko V titled himself as the Duke of Głogówek and Prudnik. During the Hussite Wars, the town of Prudnik and nearby villages were plundered and burned down by the Hussites. On 23 March 1464, Prudnik and villages around it were excommunicated by Pope Pius II for refusing to pay the debt of Duke Konrad IV the Elder. Although local historian Antoni Dudek has claimed that the excommunication was revoked in 16th century, the Holy See never revealed a document that lifted the curse.

=== Early modern era ===

In 1506, a Silesian &quot;Sejm&quot; took place in Prudnik, in the presence of King Sigismund I the Old of Poland. While in Prudnik, the King recruited 200 troops into the light cavalry to maintain public order in Silesia. After the death of Duke Jan II the Good in 1532, Prudnik, along with the entire Duchy of Opole and Racibórz, was incorporated into the Habsburg monarchy. In 1562, the Austrian-ruled Duchy of Opole and Racibórz passed a resolution that obligated Jews to sell their houses, pay their debts, and leave the duchy in a year. On the basis of this resolution, in 1564, Jews were ordered to leave Prudnik, but Krzysztof Prószkowski, who leased the land there, let them stay until 1570.

In the years 1645–1666, Prudnik belonged to the Polish–Lithuanian House of Vasa as a fief. As a royal city, Prudnik became a hub of trade and industry. Linen makers of Prudnik were exporting their products to the Netherlands. Tanning businesses were also started in the town. Since the 16th century, the richest noblemen of the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz were settling in the town, and Prudnik became the most important industrial and political hub of Upper Silesia. It was also the place in which the Silesian Sejms took place. The noble family of Bilitzer originated from Prudnik.

The population of Prudnik was decimated during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1625, the town suffered a plague epidemic. On 12 February 1629, Emperor Ferdinand II exiled the Protestant clergy of Prudnik, while people of the town were forced to convert to Catholicism. In 1642, the Swedish army captured Prudnik, then they plundered it and burned it down. After the end of the war, the town was rebuilt thanks to Emperor Ferdinand III&#x27;s financial help. Soon, Prudnik would become the biggest city of Upper Silesia. Prudnik was a place of witch trials.
Because of Prudnik being located at the borderlands, the town was a sight of multiple battles during the Silesian Wars. On 30 June 1761, King Frederick the Great of Prussia visited the town. In February 1779, during the War of the Bavarian Succession, Austrians led an artillery attack on Prudnik, burning down most of the town&#x27;s buildings. In an act of revenge, Prussians destroyed Krnov. Prudnik was visited by Emperor Joseph II in August 1779. On 20 August 1788, King Frederick William II of Prussia was passing through the town. He spent the night in the local Town House, while his son Frederick William III accommodated in a house by the Market Square.

In the middle of the 18th century, Prudnik was considered to be the richest town of Upper Silesia. Its incomes were ten times higher than that of Opole, the capital of the region. This was caused by the fact that the town was an owner of eleven nearby villages: Czyżowice, Dębowiec, Dytmarów, Jasiona, Krzyżkowice, Lubrza, Piorunkowice, Pokrzywna, Skrzypiec, Szybowice, Wieszczyna and a part of Rudziczka. After the feudal service was abolished in the 19th century and the villages became independent, Prudnik&#x27;s Town Council began to look for a source of income in forestry. Prudnik owned one of the biggest communal forest complexes in Upper Silesia (the Prudnik Forest), with an area of more than .

=== 19th century ===

The start of the 19th century saw further development of the town, mainly through the accommodation of Prussian soldiers. During the Napoleonic Wars, Prudnik was captured by the French army at the start of 1807. In accordance to Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s decree from 6 April 1807, an uhlan regiment of the Legion of the Vistula was formed in Prudnik. The regiment was made up of Polish troops returning from Italy, reinforced with recruits from Greater Poland. Prudnik remained under French occupation until 1812, when it was captured by Russians. After the wars, in 1816 the town had a debt of 82,330 thalers, with revenues of 14,687 thalers and expenses of 14,238 thalers. The debt lasted until the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. In 1828, the town had about 4,000 inhabitants. The first spinning and weaving mills for wool, linen and silk were built in the town, as well as a textile factory (known as ZPB &quot;Frotex&quot; since 1945) founded by the Jewish industrialist Samuel Fränkel. A brickyard, a brewery, mills and a vinegar factory were also built. In reference to the main professions of its inhabitants, Prudnik was nicknamed the &quot;town of weavers and shoemakers&quot;.

Despite Prudnik being one of the biggest industrial centres of Upper Silesia, no workers&#x27; protests against capitalists were recorded to take place in the town, even during the Silesian weavers&#x27; uprising of 1844 and the Revolutions of 1848. In preparations to the January Uprising of 1863, the Central National Committee designated Prudnik as a &quot;contact point&quot; and a &quot;weapons collection point&quot;. Poles carried out conspiratorial activities in the vicinity of the town. After the start of the uprising, controls on the border between Prussia and Austria were tightened. Everybody arriving in Prudnik had to report to the police, and the local military garrison was put on alert and took over the duties of units from nearby cities, as they were sent to guard the Prussian–Russian border. Three Polish soldiers from Prudnik took part in the January Uprising: Hieronim Olszewski, Piotr Linowski and Antoni Strogiński.

In 1876, Prudnik was connected with Nysa and Koźle via a railway line, and in 1896, a railway line between Prudnik and Gogolin started operating. In January 1898, the first social democratic conference of Upper Silesia took place in Prudnik.

=== Early 20th century ===

At the beginning of the 20th century, a municipal bathhouse, a Town Park and military barracks were built in Prudnik. The town became a military garrison. The indigenous Polish population was subject to Germanisation policies. Due to the lack of Polish schools, local Poles sent their children to schools in so-called Congress Poland in the Russian Partition of Poland. Local Polish activist, publicist and teacher , was investigated by the local Prussian administration and police for writing about this practice in the &quot;Gazeta Toruńska&quot;, a major Polish newspaper in the Prussian Partition of Poland. In July 1903, Prudnik and its surrounding area suffered a giant flood. One month later, Empress Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein visited Głuchołazy, Jarnołtówek and Prudnik to inspect places destroyed during the flood. She provided money for the construction of a water dam in Jarnołtówek. According to a 1 December 1910 census, among 18,864 inhabitants of Prudnik, 18,072 spoke German, 565 spoke Polish, 3 spoke a different language, and 224 were bilingual. During the First World War, a military hospital operated in the Fatebenefratelli monsatery in Prudnik.

Prudnik remained part of Germany after Poland regained independence in 1918, however, Polish organizations still operated in the town in the interbellum, including the Union of Poles in Germany and the Polish-Catholic School Society. Polish Prime Minister Ignacy Jan Paderewski proposed to incorporate Prudnik into Poland in his unrealized political concept of the United States of Poland, which was presented to the US President Woodrow Wilson.

Only the eastern territory of the district of Prudnik was part of the 1921 Upper Silesia plebiscite. A Polish Plebiscite Committee was established in Prudnik, but over time it was moved to Głogówek and then to Strzeleczki, as its headquarters in Prudnik were demolished. Prudnik was a concentration place for German militias. The town housed a secret warehouse of military equipment for paramilitary units. It was a recruitment base for Freikorps troops. During the Silesian Uprisings, several Polish sabotage groups operated in Prudnik and its vicinity, with a goal of hindering German military operations. During the Third Silesian Uprising in 1921, a German kangaroo court operated in Prudnik. Poles convicted by the court were executed by shooting in a forest between Prudnik and Niemysłowice. Field hospitals for wounded soldiers and volunteers operated in the town.

In a secret &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; report from 1934, Prudnik was named one of the main centers of the Polish movement in western Upper Silesia. Nazi Germany increasingly persecuted local Polish activists since 1937, and carried out mass arrests in August and September 1939. After the Munich Agreement, on 7 October 1938 Adolf Hitler arrived in Prudnik by train and then travelled to the Sudetenland. After visiting the Sudeten territories, he returned to Prudnik and went to Berlin by train. He was accompanied by Nazi officials and officers, including Hermann Göring, Heinrich Himmler, Gerd von Rundstedt, Erhard Milch and Hans-Jürgen Stumpff. During the Night of Broken Glass on 9–10 November 1938, Nazi militias burned down the local synagogue, founded in 1877 by Samuel Fränkel.

=== World War II ===

During the Second World War, a military hospital was opened in the Fatebenefratelli monsatery again, with subsidiaries in the building of a local school and in the Castle in nearby Moszna. The Germans established four forced labour camps and four working units for British and Soviet prisoners of war. On 26 September 1944, a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp was founded in the &quot;Schlesische Feinweberei AG&quot; textile mill (now ZPB &quot;Frotex&quot;). Around 400 women, mostly from German-occupied Hungary, were imprisoned in the subcamp, and some died. In January 1945, the prisoners of the subcamp were evacuated by the Germans to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in a death march. During the final months of the war, the town was also a stopping place of death marches of thousands of prisoners of several other subcamps of Auschwitz, and of Allied prisoners-of-war transferred by the Nazis from all over Europe to stalags built in occupied Poland. About 30,000 PoWs were force-marched westward across Poland, Czechoslovakia and Germany in winter conditions, lasting about four months from January to April 1945.

The Red Army started planning an attack on Prudnik in March 1945. It was supposed to be the most important part of the Upper Silesian offensive. The Soviets captured the town on 17 March 1945. In April of that year, the Red Army organised a ghetto for around 9,000 German inhabitants of the town. Prudnik remained on the frontline until May 1945, as German units stationed in close proximity to the town. Around 200 thousand soldiers took part in fighting for the town. On 23 April 1945, the Market Square, Parish Square and Castle Square were bombarded by the Soviet airforce. However, it is not known whether the bombing was intentional. According to a local priest Franz Pietsch, the bombardment was caused by drunk Russians shooting out incorrect light signals.

Around 15% of the buildings in Prudnik were destroyed during the war, including the Nativity of the Virgin Mary Sanctuary and the Schwedenschanze tourist shelter. The northern part of the Market Square with Town Hall was heavily damaged.

=== In communist Poland ===

Polish administration took over civil rule in the Prudnik County on 11 May 1945. A part of Poles from the Eastern Borderlands were relocated to the Prudnik and its surrounding area. Specifically, people from Nadwórna (now Nadvirna, Ukraine), the area of Tarnopol (now Ternopil), settled in the town, along with immigrants from Central Poland and people relocated from Czerniowce (now Chernivtsi, Ukraine). The majority of the German inhabitants of the town were expelled to Germany, however, unlike other parts of the so-called Recovered Territories, the surrounding region&#x27;s indigenous population remained and was not forcibly expelled as elsewhere.

The first name given to the town under Polish administration was &quot;Prądnik&quot;. It was changed to &quot;Prudnik&quot; on 7 May 1946. The change was preceded by months of debate in the local press, and at one point both names were in use simultaneously. The first Polish mayor of the town was Antoni Błaszczyński, and the first starosta was Józef Sopa. The Red Army terrorised the local population by robbing people and raping women, including children. On 3 June 1945, Czechoslovak militia from Zlaté Hory arrived in Prudnik and captured the local Town Hall, announcing that the town belongs to Czechoslovakia. Polish soldiers convinced the Czechs to leave without a firefight.

Since 1945 to 1956, a Security Office was located at the Klasztorna Street in Prudnik. An anti-communist military organization Underground Home Army operated in the town and its vicinity. Since 6 October 1954 to 27 October 1955, cardinal Stefan Wyszyński was imprisoned in the Franciscan monastery in Prudnik.

The Museum of Prudnik Region and the Prudnik Forest District were founded in 1959. In the years 1964–1974, the Nowotki housing estate (since 1990 the Wyszyńskiego housing estate) was built in the southern part of the town. In the 1970s, the Jasionowe Wzgórze housing estate was built in the eastern part of town. In August 1977, Prudnik and its surrounding area were hit by a flood caused by heavy rainfall. The flood wave destroyed a railway bridge at Słowicza Street.

In September 1980, 1,500 workers of ZPB &quot;Frotex&quot; and firefighters from the factory&#x27;s fire brigade went on the biggest anti-communist strike in Opole Voivodeship. The strike lasted 5 days (5–10 September). Other factories in the town also went on strikes.

=== In modern Poland ===

After the first elections to local self-government in Poland after its restoration in 1990, Jan Roszkowski became the mayor of Prudnik. In December 1990, a monument to the Red Army was removed from the Wolności Square. A momunent to Polish soldiers was erected in its place in 1996. The military garrison of Prudnik was liquidated in May 1994. In June 1997, the municipal sewage treatment plant at Poniatowskiego Street was put into operation.

Prudnik was the first town in Poland to be flooded during the July 1997 Central European flood. Water from the Złoty Potok river destroyed the pedestrian bridge at Kościuszki Street. The streets of Kochanowskiego, Morcinka, Chrobrego, Batorego, Powstańców Śląskich, Kolejowa, Ogrodowa, Nyska, as well as numerous industrial plants were flooded by water from the Prudnik river. In total, 192 people were evacuated from the town and surrounding villages.

In 2007 and 2014, two of the biggest factories in the town were shut down: Prudnickie Zakłady Obuwia &quot;Primus&quot; and Zakłady Przemysłu Bawełnianego &quot;Frotex&quot;. In 2009, the local castle tower, known as &quot;Wok&#x27;s Tower&quot;, was renovated and adapted into a scenic viewpoint. On 20 June 2015, Prudnik joined the Cittaslow International organisation.

Prudnik was flooded during the 2024 Central European floods. The water destroyed several elements of the town&#x27;s historical architecture and three pedestrian bridges. Two industrial plants and sports infrastructure were flooded.

Historically, Prudnik was a predominantly German-speaking town, unlike nearby Biała, Głogówek and Strzeleczki, which were Polish. Following the end of the Second World War and post-1945 expulsions of the remaining pre-war population, Prudnik became predominantly Polish-speaking. New incomers were primarily resettled from areas in the east which Poland lost (Stanisławów and Tarnopol voivodeships), or from other provinces, notably the Lesser Poland region. German nationals, as well as Silesians, who stayed in the town were either resettled in the late 1940s and 1950s, or assimilated. A cultural society exists to promote German culture in the still-existing German minority.

<text>Strzelce Opolskie (, ) is a town in southern Poland with 17,900 inhabitants (2019), situated in the Opole Voivodeship. It is the capital of Strzelce County.

==Etymology==
The name of the town is of Polish origin and comes from the old Polish word &quot;strzelec&quot;, which means &quot;hunter&quot; or &quot;archer&quot;.

==Demographics==
Strzelce Opolskie is one of the biggest centers of German minority in Poland.

==Transport==
The town is located along the major rail line which joins Gliwice and Opole. Until 1999, there was a branch line connecting Strzelce Opolskie with Kędzierzyn Koźle. It closed as part of PKP&#x27;s cost-cutting measures, although the rails still (2006) remain in site.

The town is located on the Polish National road No. 94, and the Voivodeship roads 409 and 426.

==History==

The settlement was mentioned in 13th-century documents, when it was part of Piast-ruled Poland. It received town rights probably in the 13th century. Local dukes of the Piast dynasty erected a castle in the town.

The town was annexed by Prussia in the 18th century, and then from 1871 to 1945 it was also part of Germany. In the 18th century, Strzelce Opolskie belonged to the tax inspection region of Prudnik. According to the German census of 1890, it had a population of 5,112, of which 500 (9.8%) were Poles. In the Upper Silesia plebiscite held in 1921, the residents were asked to choose between remaining in Germany and rejoining Poland, which just regained independence after World War I. In Groß Strehlitz, 85.7% of the votes were cast in favour of remaining in Germany.

In a secret &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; report from 1934, the town was named one of the main centers of the Polish movement in western Upper Silesia. Polish activists were persecuted intensively since 1937. In April and May 1939, multiple German attacks on Poles took place in the town. Nazi German militants attacked the actors of the Polish theater from Katowice and the gathered Polish public, and demolished the theater hall of the Polish bank. The Hitler Youth devastated the headquarters of Polish organizations, Polish enterprises (bank and cooperative) and houses of local Polish activists. In August and September 1939, the Germans carried out arrests of prominent local Poles, including chairmen of the Polish bank, cooperative and local branch of the &quot;Sokół&quot; Polish Gymnastic Society, and confiscated the assets of the Polish bank. During World War II, Nazi Germany operated a detention center where it would send prisoners to forced labour. Many died from exhaustion and/or starvation. Among the prisoners were Poles arrested for rescuing Jews from the Holocaust. The Germans also operated the E365 labour subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp at the local lime quarry, and a forced labour camp for Jews. After the defeat of Germany in the war in 1945, the town became again part of Poland.

==Sports==
The local football club is Piast Strzelce Opolskie with men and women sections. Both sections compete in the lower leagues.

<text>William Hugh Kenner (January 7, 1923 – November 24, 2003) was a Canadian literary scholar, critic and professor. His studies on Modernist literature often analyzed the work of James Joyce, Ezra Pound, and Samuel Beckett. His major study of the period, &quot;The Pound Era&quot;, argued for Pound as the central figure of Modernism, and is considered one of the most important works on the topic.

==Biography==
===Early years and education===
Kenner was born in Peterborough, Ontario, on January 7, 1923. His father H. R. H. Kenner taught classics and his mother Mary (Williams) Kenner taught French and German at Peterborough Collegiate Institute. Kenner attributed his interest in literature to his poor hearing, caused by a bout of influenza during his childhood.

Attending the University of Toronto, Kenner studied under Marshall McLuhan, who wrote the introduction to Kenner&#x27;s first book &quot;Paradox in Chesterton&quot;, about G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s works. Kenner&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Poetry of Ezra Pound&quot; (1951) was dedicated to McLuhan, who had introduced Kenner to Pound on June 4, 1948, during Pound&#x27;s incarceration at St. Elizabeths Hospital, Washington, DC, where Kenner and McLuhan had driven as a detour from their trip from Toronto to New Haven, Connecticut. (Pound, who became a friend of Kenner&#x27;s, had suggested the book be titled &quot;The Rose in the Steel Dust&quot;.) Later, Kenner said of McLuhan, &quot;I had the advantage of being exposed to Marshall when he was at his most creative, and then of getting to the far end of the continent shortly afterward, when he couldn&#x27;t get me on the phone all the time. He could be awfully controlling.&quot; Later, when McLuhan wrote that the development of cartography during the Renaissance created a geographical sense that had never previously existed, Kenner sent him a postcard reading in full: &quot;Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres, Yours, Hugh.&quot;

In 1950, Kenner earned a PhD from Yale University, with a dissertation on James Joyce, written under the supervision of Cleanth Brooks. This work, which won the John Addison Porter Prize at Yale, became &quot;Dublin&#x27;s Joyce&quot; in 1956.

===Academic career===
Kenner&#x27;s first teaching post was at the University of California, Santa Barbara (1951 to 1973); he then taught at Johns Hopkins University (from 1973 to 1990) and the University of Georgia (from 1990 to 1999).

Kenner played an influential role in raising Ezra Pound&#x27;s profile among critics and other readers of poetry. The publication of &quot;The Poetry of Ezra Pound&quot; in 1951 &quot;was the beginning, and the catalyst, for a change in attitude toward Pound on the American literary and educational scenes.&quot; &quot;The Pound Era&quot;, the product of years of scholarship and considered by many to be Kenner&#x27;s masterpiece, was published in 1971. This work was responsible for enshrining Pound&#x27;s reputation (damaged by his wartime sympathy for fascism) as one of the greatest Modernists.

Though best known for his work on modernist literature, Kenner&#x27;s range of interests was wide. His books include an appreciation of Chuck Jones, an introduction to geodesic math, and a user&#x27;s guide for the Heathkit H100/Zenith Z-100 computer; in his later years he was a columnist for both &quot;Art &amp; Antiques&quot; and &quot;Byte&quot; magazine. Kenner was a friend of William F. Buckley, Jr., to whom Kenner introduced word processing, and a contributor to &quot;National Review&quot;. He also shared a close correspondence with Guy Davenport, the noted scholar, fiction writer, and artist.

===Personal life===
Kenner was married twice: his first wife, Mary Waite, died in 1964; the couple had three daughters and two sons. His second wife, whom he married in 1965, was Mary-Anne Bittner; they had a son and a daughter.

===Death===
Hugh Kenner died at his home in Athens, Georgia, on November 24, 2003.

<text>Mrągowo (until 1947 ; ; Masurian: Zondzbork) is a resort town in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship of northeastern Poland, with 21,889 inhabitants (2019). It is the capital of Mrągowo County and the seat (though not part of) the Gmina Mrągowo. The town is located in the historical region of Masuria, within the Masurian Lake District, about east of Olsztyn.

It is situated on the shores of lakes Czos, Sutapie Małe, Sołtysko, Czarne, Juno and Piecuch.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
About 1348 the Teutonic Knights constructed a wooden fortress near present-day Mrągowo named &quot;Sensburg&quot;, derived from Old Prussian &quot;senas&quot; meaning &quot;old&quot;, therefore maybe at the site of a former Prussian castle. The settlement that began to develop nearby was first mentioned in a 1397 deed and probably had already received Kulm town rights between 1404 and 1407, although it is verified that Grand Master Konrad von Erlichshausen affirmed town rights in 1444. In 1454 it was incorporated to Poland by King Casimir IV Jagiellon upon the request of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, and after the subsequent Thirteen Years’ War (1454–1466) it was a part of Poland as a fief. To the town&#x27;s Polish population it was known as &quot;Ządźbork&quot;.

===Modern era===

Ządźbork became part of the Duchy of Prussia, a vassal state of Poland, in 1525. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the town suffered through fires and plagues.

Part of the Kingdom of Prussia since 1701, the town was incorporated into the Province of East Prussia after its creation in 1773. It was heavily devastated during the Napoleonic Wars. It remained mostly a small hamlet in the largely rural area around it. Agriculture, fishing and the richness of the surrounding forests provided the sources of income for the local population. Just like all of Masuria the district was inhabited mainly by Poles, and town itself had majority Polish population in 1816 however in the 19th century their percentage began to decrease due to Germanisation, removal of the Polish language from schools and the pressure of the local German administration (from 86% in 1825 to 59% in 1890). The town became the county seat in 1818, with its first &quot;Landrat&quot; (country executive) being August von Lyśniewski. The Polish secret resistance was active and smuggled weapons through the town to the Russian Partition of Poland during the January Uprising. In August 1863, the Prussians discovered the activity, carried out arrests of local resistance members and seized a shipment of weapons headed to the town. In 1871 Sensburg became part of the German Empire during the Prussian-led unification of Germany. In 1897 the town became connected to the railway system, which went from Bischofsburg (Biskupiec) to Rastenburg (Kętrzyn/Rastembork). In 1903 the city received a donation from Edward Pałasz to acquire its own forest, where it then built recreational facilities.
Following World War I, as a condition of the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations held the East Prussian plebiscite on 11 July 1920 to determine if the people in the southern districts of East Prussia wanted to remain within the Free State of Prussia and Germany or to join the Second Polish Republic. Before the vote German nationalists engaged in brutal excesses, which remained unhindered by meagre presence of Allied forces; a Scottish regiment only once visited the city, and only to demonstrate a music orchestra. The plebiscite resulted in 3,660 votes for Germany and none for Poland.

At the end of World War II the town was overrun by the Red Army during the East Prussian Offensive and lost almost 20% of its buildings.

From 1945 to 1947 the city was known by the historic Polish name &quot;Ządzbork&quot;. The city&#x27;s name was changed to the current &quot;Mrągowo&quot; in 1947, in honor of Polish pastor, writer and translator Krzysztof Celestyn Mrongovius (1764–1855), a noted defender of the Polish language in Masuria.

Local populace, mostly spared expulsion due to their Polish ethnicity, but many resisted being treated as Poles. The 1940-50s saw repeated measures implemented to force the locals to sign that they were Poles, or to receive Polish identify cards. People who declined often were interned.

After the war, Mrągowo remained a rural town with approximately 10,000 inhabitants; this number stayed almost constant until the late 1980s. In the following decade, mostly due to economic and political changes, the town gained some influence in the region and grew quickly into a regional center for economic business and tourism. Recently Mrągowo has tried to regain some of its former beauty and to represent the region.

==Coat of arms==
The town&#x27;s coat of arms derives from a local story of the 15th century. It claims that when a group of local farmers was being threatened by predators, the townspeople tracked down a fearsome bear. They were only able to shoot it in its paw, and it managed to flee to Rastembork. Only upon its arrival there did the bear succumb to its injuries. The bear&#x27;s paw was brought back to Ządźbork and is honored in the coat of arms.

<text>Bartoszyce ( ; , ) is a town on the Łyna River in northern Poland, with 22,597 inhabitants as of December 2021. It is the capital of Bartoszyce County within the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship.

==Geographical location==
Bartoszyce lies on the left shore of river Łyna River in a valley, approximately east of Elbląg and south of Kaliningrad, at an altitude of above sea level.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

Around 1241 the Teutonic Knights (the monastic German Order) constructed a castle on the left shore of the Łyna River on the border between the Old Prussian regions of Natangia and Bartia. The castle was part of the district (&quot;Komturei&quot;) of Balga. It was first composed of stone houses, palisades, and earthworks and later built of bricks.

Besieged by the native Old Prussians for four years during an uprising beginning in 1260, the castle was destroyed in 1264. The Order rebuilt it shortly afterward, but it was besieged by another Baltic group, the Sudovians, in 1273. After the Old Prussian uprisings ended, the Knights rebuilt the Ordensburg out of stone from 1274–80. During the 14th and 15th centuries, the castle was managed by the Komtur (administrator) of Balga.

Thereafter, a settlement developed near the castle on the right shore of the Alle River opposite the castle. First documented in 1326 under the name &quot;Rosenthal&quot;, it received town privileges from the Teutonic Grand Master Luther von Braunschweig in 1332. After that the name was changed to Bartenstein and the settlement of Rosenthal below the castle on the left shore of the river was relocated, as the left side had become too endangered by warfare. Poles settled in sizeable numbers in Bartenstein from the 14th to the 17th century. The town&#x27;s Polish residents used the Polish names &quot;Bartoszyce&quot; and &quot;Barsztyn&quot;. The town&#x27;s Teutonic Order administrator (German: &quot;Komtur&quot;), Henning Schindekopf of Balga, began construction of a wall around the town in 1353.

In 1440, the town joined the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, upon the request of which Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region and town to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. At the beginning of the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War, the Teutonic castle was destroyed and was not rebuilt afterward. However, the residents of Bartenstein became reconciled with the Teutonic Knights in 1460. After the peace treaty signed in Toruń in 1466, the town became part of Poland as a fief held by the State of the Teutonic Order. To stabilize the Order&#x27;s financial situation, the Order sold the ruined castle&#x27;s farmyard and meadows to Wend von Eulenburg in 1469; the entire manor of Bartenstein was sold in 1513 to &quot;Heinrich Reuß von Plauen&quot; (not &quot;the&quot; Grand Master).

===Modern era===

With the secularization of the Teutonic Order&#x27;s Prussian territories in 1525, the town became part of the Duchy of Prussia, established with the consent of the Polish king Sigismund I the Old, as a vassal state of the Polish Crown. The town converted to Protestantism in the same year during the Protestant Reformation.

Bartenstein became part of the secular Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 and the Prussian Province of East Prussia in 1773. During the Napoleonic Wars, Prussia and the Russian Empire signed a treaty of alliance in the town on 26 April 1807, the Treaty of Bartenstein. Administrative reform following the Napoleonic Wars placed Bartenstein within East Prussia&#x27;s Landkreis Friedland in 1818. The town was subjected to Germanisation policies, and although the post of a Polish preacher still existed in 1829, the appointed preacher did not speak Polish.
The Lyck-Bartenstein (Ełk–Bartoszyce) train line ran through the town in 1868, leading to the establishment of industries, including an iron foundry, a machine factory, and a train-car factory. It was also noted for its oak trade. A garrison town for the Prussian Army, Bartenstein was the seat of the district court. Because it had grown to become the largest town in Landkreis Friedland during the 19th century, the town was made the district capital in 1902. Landkreis Friedland was renamed Landkreis Bartenstein in 1927. The foundations of the old castle were used in the construction of the administrative seat; this building was destroyed in 1945.

During World War II, the town was 50% destroyed in fighting between German forces and the Soviet Red Army. 
After German surrender, the Soviets ceremoniously transferred sovereignty over the town to Polish authorities on June 15, 1945. The already established Polish rule was accepted at the Potsdam Conference, however, on preliminary terms. Remaining German residents who had survived were either evacuated or later expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, and the town was repopulated with Poles.

As part of the repressions against the Catholic Church, the communists created a special military unit in Bartoszyce, to which they forcibly conscripted students of theological seminaries. The future priest Jerzy Popiełuszko did his military service there in 1966–1968. He initiated resistance, for which he was repeatedly punished, affecting his health for the rest of his life. There is a memorial to Jerzy Popiełuszko in Bartoszyce.
Bartoszyce was administratively located in Olsztyn Voivodeship from 1946 to 1998. It became part of the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship in 1999.

<text>Szczytno (; Masurian: Scÿtno) is a town in northeastern Poland with 27,970 inhabitants (2004). It is the seat of Szczytno County in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodship, within the historic region of Masuria.

Olsztyn-Mazury Regional Airport, located nearby, is the most important airport of the Masurian region. Szczytno, which is located on the Olsztyn – Ełk line, and used to be a railroad junction until Polish Railways closed minor connections stemming from the town towards Czerwonka and Wielbark.

Two lakes, Domowe Małe and Długie (also known as &quot;Domowe Duże&quot;), are located within the town limits.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

Near today&#x27;s Szczytno are the only known megalithic tombs in Warmia-Masuria. The town was originally a settlement of Old Prussians.

Between 1350 and 1360 Ortolf von Trier, a knight of the Teutonic Order and the Komtur of Elbing (Elbląg), founded a fort in the Old Prussian region of Galindia, probably near an Old Prussian settlement. The first mention of the fort, eponymously named Ortulfsburg, was a document from September 1360, after Ortolf invited Polish colonists from nearby Masovia, among whom the settlement became known as &quot;Szczytno&quot;. The first custodian of the settlement was Heinrich Murer. In 1370 the wooden fort was destroyed by Lithuanians led by Kęstutis, after which it was rebuilt using stone. In German, the name Ortulfsburg gradually morphed into Ortelsburg. The settlement grew in size owing to its location on a trade route from Warsaw to Königsberg (now Kaliningrad).

In the wake of the Polish-Lithuanian victory over the Order at Grunwald in 1410, the castle was occupied by Polish troops. In 1454 King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the town and region to the Kingdom of Poland upon the request of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation. After the Second Peace of Toruń of 1466 it became part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic state. In the 15th century, a Catholic church was built, whose first parish priest became Mikołaj of Rzekwuj from the Płock land in Masovia.

===Modern era===

With its inclusion in the Ducal Prussia in 1525, which remained under Polish suzerainty, it lost its importance as a border fortress and began to decline. It was a overwhelmingly Polish town, and, according to Gerard Labuda, in 1538 only four townsmen did not speak Polish. Margrave and regent George Frederick, who enjoyed hunting nearby, began the redevelopment of the area. Among his projects was the rebuilding of the castle into a hunting lodge. King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland visited the town from 1628–29 and in 1639. Ortelsburg suffered from 17th century fires and the plague in 1656.

The town became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. King Frederick William I of Prussia granted Ortelsburg its town charter in 1723. In 1773 it was included in the newly formed province of East Prussia. Prussian King Frederick William III and Queen Louise arrived in the town on 23 November 1806 while fleeing French troops during the Fourth Coalition. The town was briefly the seat of the Prussian government, and Frederick William released his &quot;Ortelsburger Publicandum&quot; — a series of constitutional, administrative, social and economic reforms — there on 1 December 1806. Later that month, French troops occupied and plundered Ortelsburg. Six years later the town was forced to host numerous troops of the Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée, which invaded Russia.

In 1818, after the Prussian administrative reforms, Ortelsburg became the seat of Landkreis Ortelsburg, one of the largest in East Prussia. The town became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany.

It became an important center of the Polish movement in Masuria and resistance to Germanisation. In 1849-1851 a bilingual folk magazine &quot;Der masurische Hahn/Kurek Mazurski&quot; was issued in the town. The Masurian People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Mazurska Partia Ludowa&quot;), founded in 1896 in Lyck (Ełk), had one of its main branches here. From 1906 the Polish newspaper &quot;Mazur&quot; was published here, and in 1910, Bogumił Labusz and Gustaw Leyding founded the Masurian People&#x27;s Bank (&quot;Mazurski Bank Ludowy&quot;). In 1908 Polish writer and Nobel Prize laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz, who popularized the small town through his historical novel &quot;The Knights of the Cross&quot; and whose works were published in &quot;Mazur&quot;, visited the town. In post-World War II Poland, a monument to Sienkiewicz was unveiled in the town center, next to the town hall and the ruins of the castle.

=== Historical population ===
===World War I and interbellum ===

Ortelsburg was almost completely destroyed at the beginning of World War I by troops of the Russian Empire, 160 houses and 321 commercial buildings burned down between 27 and 30 August 1914. The town&#x27;s recovery was supported by contributions raised in Berlin and Vienna. In 1916 the Viennese modernist Josef Hoffmann visited Ortelsburg, his plans for a new town hall were not carried out. A new town hall, an example of Nazi architecture in East Prussia, was finally built in 1938 and listed as a historical monument in 1991. The initial plans for the reconstruction of the town were based on Bruno Möhring&#x27;s work but carried out by several local architects.

The East Prussian plebiscite of 11 July 1920, which was held according to the Versailles treaty under the supervision of Allied troops, resulted in 5,336 votes for Germany and 15 for Poland. It was preceded by persecution of local Polish activists by the Germans, pro-Polish rallies and meetings were dispersed. On January 21, 1920 (&quot;Bloody Wednesday&quot;) a German militia armed with crowbars, metal rods, and shovels, attacked the gathering of local Polish activists and severely beat local Polish leaders Bogumił Linka and Bogumił Leyk, all at the instigation of the local German authorities. Even after the plebiscite pro-Polish voters and activists were still persecuted.

During the interwar period, Polish-speaking residents of the region organized &quot;Samopomoc Mazurska&quot; (&quot;Masurian Self-Help&quot;), an organisation for the protection of Poles in southern East Prussia. A Polish activist Jerzy Lanc was killed during his attempt to establish a Polish school. Ortelsburg was the location of the Polish House, in which meetings of Polish journalists and activists were held. The Polish House was the headquarters of such organisations as &quot;Zjednoczenie Mazurskie&quot;, &quot;Samopomoc Mazurska&quot; and the Union of Poles in Germany. Today the building is dedicated to the memory of the people and institutions that were engaged in Polish movement in Masuria. The Polish newspaper &quot;Mazurski Przyjaciel Ludu&quot; was published in the town in the 1920s. Even before the invasion of Poland, the German authorities expelled two local Polish activists in January 1939, and later in 1939 more activists were arrested, including the Polish editor Robert Kraszewski, who was then imprisoned in the and later beheaded in the Moabit prison in Berlin. Some Polish activists managed to flee in the 1930s.

In the March 1933 German federal election, after the Nazi seizure of power and suppression of anti-Nazi political factions, the Nazi Party polled 76.6% of vote in Ortelsburg, compared to the national German average of only 43.9%.

===World War II and post-war Poland===
In October 1943, Polish partisans of the Home Army sabotaged a railroad turnout, causing two trains to collide. Near the end of World War II, most of the town&#x27;s German population fled before the Red Army. Those who remained behind were either killed in the final months of the war or expelled after its end in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The town was placed under Polish administration in 1945 under border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference, renamed to the historic Polish &quot;Szczytno&quot; and gradually repopulated with Poles. The first group of Poles expelled from former Eastern Poland, which was annexed by the Soviet Union, arrived to Szczytno in June 1945 from Volhynia.

After the war, the town&#x27;s life was organized anew. In 1946-1948 new schools were founded, including a pedagogical school, a vocational school and a school for kindergarten teachers. In 1947 a public library was founded and in 1954 a culture center was established. Since 1948, the town hall, besides the local administration, also houses the Masurian Museum in Szczytno (&quot;Muzeum Mazurskie w Szczytnie&quot;).

The nearby Szczytno-Szymany International Airport, as well as Stare Kiejkuty, a military intelligence training base, came under scrutiny in late 2005 as one of the suspected &quot;black sites&quot; (secret prisons or transfer stations) used in the CIA&#x27;s program of so-called extraordinary rendition of accused terrorists. The existence of the nearby training base and the record of CIA-registered affiliated aircraft having landing at Szczytno-Szymany have been unequivocally confirmed, but the Polish government has repeatedly denied any involvement of these facilities in extraordinary renditions.

To commemorate old Masurian folk traditions, a number of &quot;Pofajdok&quot; sculptures were placed in Szczytno.

==Sights==

Among the historic sights of Szczytno are the ruins of the castle, the pre-war town hall, which houses the municipal and county authorities, as well as the Masurian Museum (&quot;Muzeum Mazurskie&quot;), dedicated to the history, ethnology and culture of Masuria and Szczytno, a Baroque Evangelical church, the pre-war Polish House (&quot;Dom Polski&quot;), which was the center of social and cultural life of the local Polish community during the times of Germanisation and the well-preserved old wooden Masurian House (&quot;Chata Mazurska&quot;). Also are located there the Gothic Revival Catholic Church of the Assumption and Baptist Church, the historic buildings of the district court, nursing home, tax office, police school, post office and former brewery.

<text>Kętrzyn (, until 1946 &quot;Rastembork&quot;; ) is a town in northeastern Poland with 27,478 inhabitants (2019). It is the capital of Kętrzyn County in the Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship.

The town is known for the surrounding Masurian Lakeland and numerous monuments of historical value such as the Wolf&#x27;s Lair in nearby Gierłoż, which was Adolf Hitler&#x27;s primary headquarters in Eastern Europe over the course of Nazi Germany&#x27;s military campaign on the Eastern Front during World War II. The town is also known for its 14th century Teutonic Kętrzyn Castle.

== History ==

The original inhabitants of the region were the Balt tribe of the Aesti, mentioned by Tacitus in his &quot;Germania&quot; (AD 98). The town, known in German as &quot;Rastenburg&quot; and in Polish as &quot;Rastembork&quot;, was established in 1329 in the State of the Teutonic Knights and was granted town rights in 1357 by Henning Schindekop.

After the Battle of Grunwald, in 1410, the mayor surrendered the town to Poland, however, it fell back to the Teutonic Knights in 1411. In 1440, the town joined the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation. Upon the request of the Confederation, King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region and town to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. The town then recognized the Polish King as the rightful ruler and the townspeople sent their representative to Königsberg to pay homage to the King.

After the Thirteen Years’ War (1454–1466) the town was part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Order&#x27;s state and, from 1525 to 1701, it was part of the Duchy of Prussia, a Polish fief until 1657. In the second half of the 17th century, Poles constituted around a half of the town&#x27;s population, the other half being Germans. In 1667, a Polish church school was established.

In 1701 the town became part of the Kingdom of Prussia and subsequently, in 1871, part of Germany. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, from 1758 to 1762, the town was occupied by the Russians, in June 1807, throughout the Napoleonic wars, the division of General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski was stationed in the town. Following the unsuccessful Polish November Uprising, in 1832–1833, Polish insurgents, including several officers, were interned in the town.

In the late 19th century a Polish Lutheran parish still existed in Rastenburg, despite the policy of Germanisation conducted by the Prussian authorities. In the second half of the 19th century, a sugar factory, brewery and mill were built.

===20th century===

Rastenburg and the surrounding district was the scene of the First World War&#x27;s First Battle of the Masurian Lakes and Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes. During the Second World War Adolf Hitler&#x27;s wartime military headquarters, the Wolf&#x27;s Lair, was in the forest east of Rastenburg. The bunker was the setting for the failed assassination attempt of the 20 July plot against Hitler. During the war, the Germans operated a forced labour camp for Jews in the town.

In 1945, the area suffered devastation from both the retreating Germans and advancing Soviets during the Vistula-Oder campaign. Some ruins of the Wolf&#x27;s Lair remain. The town was a Wehrmacht garrison town until it was occupied by the Red Army on 27 January 1945. The largely abandoned town was heavily destroyed by the Soviets.

After German surrender, the town was assigned to Poland by the Soviets. Sovereignty over the town was officially transferred on May 18, 1945. At the Potsdam Conference, the Western Allies accepted establishment of Polish rule. The town&#x27;s surviving German residents who had not evacuated were subsequently expelled westward in accordance with provisions included in the Potsdam Agreement and replaced with Poles, most of whom were themselves expelled from the pre-war Polish Vilnius Region that was annexed by the Soviet Union and given to the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. The town was given the historic Polish name &quot;Rastembork&quot; in 1945, and in 1946 it was renamed to &quot;Kętrzyn&quot; after the Polish historian, activist and patriot Wojciech Kętrzyński, who attended the local gymnasium in the years 1855–1859.

After the war, the town&#x27;s life was being rebuilt. In 1945, the Municipal Theater was established. Thanks to voluntary contributions, books were purchased for newly organized public libraries. A museum was created in the renovated castle.

From 1975 to 1998, Kętrzyn was administratively located in the Olsztyn Voivodeship.

<text>Iława (; ) is a town in northern Poland with 32,276 inhabitants (2010). It is the capital of Iława County in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship.

The town is located in the Iławskie Lake District, on the longest lake in Poland – Jeziorak. It is located in the area of historical Pomesania. The rivers Iławka and Tynwałd flow through Iława. Within the town&#x27;s administrative area there is the largest inland island in Poland – Wielka Żuława, which has a permanent ferry connection with the town. The town is located in the area of the Green Lungs of Poland - an area characterized by clean air and diversity of the natural system. From the west and north, Iława is surrounded by the Iława Lake District Landscape Park. Iława is a holiday, paralympic and tourist resort. In the forest just outside Iława there are two Polish Television holiday resorts (Sarnówek and Tłokowisko) to which journalists come for a holiday. From Iława, the Baltic Sea can be accessed through Jeziorak Lake and the historic, unique in the world Elbląg Canal.

At Lake Silm, one of the world&#x27;s several training centres for skippers and port pilots, they learn to manoeuvre seagoing ships on miniaturised models. The town is called the summer capital of traditional jazz because of the oldest festival of this music genre in Europe - Old Jazz Meeting &quot;Złota Tarka&quot;. In Iława there is the Pope&#x27;s Calvary of the Iława Lake District, whose canoe-shaped Stations of the Cross refer to and commemorate Karol Wojtyła&#x27;s two visits to Jeziorak, after which the future Pope was kayaking with young people. Iława lies on the Road of St. James (one of the most important Christian pilgrimage routes in the world) which leads to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostella in Spain.

== Natural conditions ==
As of January 1, 2009, the area of the city is 21. 88 km², placing the city on the third position in the province. The town is also the fifth largest in the Warmia and Mazury region and the fifth in the population.

Iława and its surroundings lie on undulating moraine and sandstone areas, distinguished by varied forms of sculpture. Within the city, on Lake Jeziorak (the longest lake in Poland and the sixth largest) is the island of Wielka Żuława with relics of an Old Prussian town. In the vicinity of the city, in the sand terrain, there are lakes, mainly gutter lakes, surrounded by significant forest complexes. In Iława itself, apart from the mentioned Jeziorak, there are a dozen or so smaller lakes (i.e. Little Jeziorak, Iławskie, Dół). The lakes and rivers of the Iławskie Lake land form, together with the Elbląg Canal, a wide system of inland navigation, connecting the surrounding water bodies. This channel makes it possible to reach the Baltic Sea from Iława.

== History ==

The city existed originally as an Old Prussian settlement and was recorded by Teutonic Knights in Prussia in 1305. It is documented in a manuscript by Luther von Braunschweig in 1317 and its first names are known as Ylavia, Ylaw, and Ilow. It was located on the Iławka River between Lakes Jeziorak and Iławskie. The town was under the jurisdiction of the komtur of Christburg (Dzierzgoń) and since 1340 under Osterode (Ostróda).

At the start of the Thirteen Years’ War (1454–1466) in February 1454, Iława sided with the Prussian Confederation, at the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region to Poland. In April 1454 the town pledged allegiance to the Polish King. After Poland&#x27;s loss at the Battle of Chojnice, in November 1454 it was taken over by the Teutonic Knights, who handed over its defence to Czech mercenaries. In 1457, the unpaid Czech mercenaries sold the town to Poland. After the peace treaty signed in Toruń in 1466 the town was a part of Poland as a fief. In 1520 Polish King Sigismund I the Old granted Iława the right to collect tolls on the bridge over Jeziorak.

In 1525 the town became part of the Duchy of Prussia, a vassal state of the Polish Crown, and in 1701 it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. Administered within the new province of West Prussia in 1773, it became part of the German Empire in 1871. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, the town was occupied by Russia between 1758 and 1762. In October–December 1831, several Polish infantry units of the November Uprising stopped in the town on the way to their internment places.

In 1862 the Elbląg Canal was built between Elbing (Elbląg) and Eylau by engineer Georg Steenke, which enabled the inland town to transport bulk of lumber, farm products, and other goods north to Elbing and the Baltic Sea. This was superseded ten years later by rail transport, when the Thorn (Toruń)-Insterburg (Chernyakhovsk) railway line was constructed.
According to the German census of 1910, the town had a population of 10,087, of which 9,566 (94.8%) were Germans and 380 (3.8%) were Poles. After Poland regained its independence in 1918, the East Prussian plebiscite of 1920 allowed the residents to cast votes either in favor of remaining in Germany or becoming a part of Poland. The vote took place amid persecution of Polish activists by the German side. Ultimately the town voted to remain in Germany by 4,746 to 235 votes. It became part of Regierungsbezirk West Prussia in the Province of East Prussia.

During World War II, the Germans operated a penal subcamp of the prison in Sztum. Its prisoners were mostly Poles, and many either died of hunger or cold, or were executed. There was also a forced labour camp for some 1,200 people, and Poles were also enslaved as forced labour in the town&#x27;s vicinity. The Polish resistance movement was active and one of the region&#x27;s main smuggling points for underground Polish press was located in the area. Towards the end of the war, most population left the town, and the Soviet Army destroyed approximately 85% of the town. After World War II, the town became again part of Poland in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The historic Polish name &quot;Iława&quot; was adopted to replace the Germanized name.

== Toponyms ==
The name Iława is thought to originate from the ancient Prussian word &quot;ilis&quot;, meaning black. The related Baltic-Slavic word &quot;ilo&quot; or &quot;ilu&quot; means the black colour but also mud. The name might refer to the swampy area where the city lies, or to the dark water of the lake Jeziorak.

<text>Ostróda (; Masurian: Ôstród; Old Prussian: &quot;Austrāti&quot;) is a town in northern Poland, in the historic region of Masuria. It is the seat of the Ostróda County within the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship and has approximately 33,191 inhabitants (2009).

Ostróda is the largest town in the western part of Masuria, and the second largest in all of Masuria after Ełk.

==Geography==

The town lies in the west of the historic Masuria region on the Drwęca river, a right tributary of the Vistula. Lake Drwęca west of the town is part of the Masurian Lake District. Ostróda has become a growing tourist site owing to its relaxing natural surroundings.

The National road 7 from Gdańsk to Warsaw, part of European route E77, passes through Ostróda. The Elbląg Canal connects Ostróda with the Baltic coast.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

At the site of an original settlement of Old Prussians on an island at the river delta where the Drwęca river flows into Lake Drwęca the town of Ostróda evolved. In 1270 the Teutonic Order began constructing wooden earthworks to control the original settlement as well as defend the initial Polish and German settlers. The knights named the new town &quot;Osterode&quot; after Osterode am Harz in present-day Lower Saxony, Germany (now a sister city with Ostróda). Between 1349-1370 the Order replaced the wood-and-earth fort with a stone castle. The town, whose charter traditionally dates to 1335, quickly became a regional administrative center for the Order.

After the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, Claus von Doringe conquered the castle and delivered the town to the victorious Polish King Władysław II Jagiełło. The Polish king brought the body of Ulrich von Jungingen there before travelling to besiege Marienburg (Malbork); the regrouping Teutonic Knights recaptured Osterode a few months later.

In 1440, local nobility co-founded the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, upon the request of which the town was incorporated to the Kingdom of Poland by King Casimir IV Jagiellon in 1454. During the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466), the town was repeatedly captured by both the Poles and Prussian Confederation on one side and the Teutonic Knights on the other. After the peace treaty signed in Toruń in 1466 it formed part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Order.

===Modern era===

From 1525 until 1701 Osterode was part of Ducal Prussia, a fief of Poland until 1657, and after 1701 part of Kingdom of Prussia. In the 17th century and until the 19th century the town and its surroundings were inhabited mostly by Poles. The majority of inhabitants were Protestant and the Evangelical church books date back to 17th century. During the Polish–Swedish War of 1626–1629, Polish troops were stationed there in 1626, and in 1628, the town was briefly occupied by the Swedes. From 1633, with the approval of the Polish King Władysław IV Vasa, Osterode and the county was under the administration of Duke John Christian of Brieg, one of the last dukes of the Piast dynasty (until his death in 1639).

After the Battle of Eylau in February 1807 French troops gathered in Osterode, from February to April 1807 Napoleon I used the castle as his headquarter. In June 1807 Polish troops of General Józef Zajączek were stationed in the town. In 1818 it became the seat of a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) within the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1871 Osterode was included in the newly formed German Empire.

In the 19th century the town was part of territory dominated by the Polish language, and the Osterode district was inhabited mostly by Poles (71% in 1825, 65% in 1867). The town was a significant Polish centre, whose most famous representative was pastor Gustaw Gizewiusz. Polish newspapers were edited and published in the town, including &quot;Mazur&quot; from 1885. In 1868 Karol Salewski established a Polish bookshop and a Polish printing house. Osterode was the largest town of Masuria in the early 20th century (according to data from 1905 and 1925), after surpassing Lyck (Ełk) (according to data from 1880 and 1890).

During World War I and the 1914 Battle of Tannenberg, General Paul von Hindenburg had his 8th Army headquarters at the Osterode schoolhouse. In the East Prussian plebiscite of 1920 8,663 inhabitants voted to remain in German East Prussia, 17 votes supported Poland.

During World War II, some expelled Poles from Lubawa County were enslaved by the Germans as forced labour in the town&#x27;s vicinity. Most of the Osterode citizens had fled during the evacuation of East Prussia, when on 21 January 1945 Osterode was captured by the Soviet Red Army without fighting. However, about 70% of the town was destroyed by arson attacks afterwards. With the conquest by the Soviet Union and the Potsdam Agreement, the town became again part of Poland and most of the remaining German population was expelled. In 1950 26 percent of the population originated from the eastern areas of pre-war Poland, 18 percent were pre-war inhabitants.

While it was previously in Olsztyn Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998, Ostróda has been situated in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship since 1999.

====Jewish community====
The first certifiable Jewish families lived in Osterode in 1732, a Jewish cemetery was established in 1735. In 1845 the Jewish community counted about 110 members, in 1860, there were 160 and in 1880 222 Jews living in Osterode. The number declined to 123 in 1933 and 75 in 1937. A small synagogue was built in 1856 and a new, larger one based on the Bromberg (Bydgoszcz) style in 1893. In 1932 a Jewish shop was attacked with explosives, boycotts of Jewish shops took place in 1935. The synagogue and the Jewish cemetery were destroyed in the Kristallnacht riots of November 1938. In 1939, the Jewish community was officially dissolved. The remaining pre-war Jewish population was murdered by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust.

<text>USS &quot;Vestal&quot; (AR-4) was a repair ship in service with the United States Navy from 1913 to 1946. Before her conversion to a repair ship, she had served as a collier since 1909. &quot;Vestal&quot; served in both World Wars. She was damaged during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and received two battle stars for her World War II service.

== Commissioning ==

The history of USS &quot;Vestal&quot; (AR-4) began when &quot;Erie&quot; (Fleet Collier No. 1) was authorized on 17 April 1904; but the ship was renamed &quot;Vestal&quot; in October 1905, well before her keel was laid down on 25 March 1907 at the New York Navy Yard, Brooklyn, New York. Launched on 19 May 1908, &quot;Vestal&quot; was placed in service as a fleet collier, with a civilian crew, at her builders&#x27; yard on 4 October 1909.

== Atlantic service 1909–1927 ==

=== Refitting ===
&quot;Vestal&quot; served the fleet as a collier, operating along the Atlantic coast and in the West Indies from the autumn of 1909 to the summer of 1910. After a voyage to Europe to coal ships of the Atlantic Fleet in those waters, the ship returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard and was taken out of service at the Boston Navy Yard on 25 October 1912. The ship underwent nearly a year&#x27;s worth of yard work and was commissioned as a fleet repair ship in 1913 under the command of Commander Edward L. Beach, Sr., USN (father of submariner Captain Edward L. Beach, Jr.).

After fitting out, &quot;Vestal&quot; departed her conversion yard on 26 October for Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she conducted her shakedown between 29 October to 10 November. After touching at Key West, Florida, for coal on 14 November, &quot;Vestal&quot; moved on to Pensacola, Florida, her base for operations as a repair ship for the Atlantic Fleet. She was attached to the Atlantic fleet and served along the east coast and in the West Indies until spring of 1914 when she was dispatched along with other ships for the occupation of the Mexican port of Vera Cruz. The auxiliary vessel provided repair services at Vera Cruz from 2 May to 20 September before she sailed for Boston, escorting the cruiser &quot;Salem&quot; to the navy yard there for .

&quot;Vestal&quot; then operated off the Virginia Capes and in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before she returned to the Boston Navy Yard on 10 June 1915, after calls at New York City and Newport, Rhode Island She took on stores and provisions at Boston and underwent repairs there before she rejoined the fleet at Narragansett Bay on 19 May 1916.

=== World War I ===
Following the U.S. entry into World War I, &quot;Vestal&quot; was deployed to Queenstown, Ireland, where she provided services for ships of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla. She stayed there for the duration of the war and beyond, finally returning in 1919. For the next six years &quot;Vestal&quot; served the Scouting Force and Battle Fleet. During the navy-wide assignment of alphanumeric hull numbers on 17 July 1920, &quot;Vestal&quot; was classified as a repair ship, AR-4.

In 1925 she underwent modification that changed her from a coal-powered ship to an oil-fired one. Soon thereafter, on 25 September, the submarine was rammed and sunk by SS &quot;City of Rome&quot; and &quot;Vestal&quot; was called to help recover the submarine. &quot;Vestal&quot; conducted her salvage operations from October to early December 1925 and again from 27 April to 5 July 1926. During the latter period, the submarine was raised from the bottom. Following the completion of recovery, &quot;Vestal&quot; was transferred to the Pacific Fleet in 1927.

== Pacific service 1927–1946 ==
The Pacific Fleet was shifted to a new base at Pearl Harbor following Fleet Problem XXI in the spring of 1940. &quot;Vestal&quot; also made the move. After returning from the west coast for an overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, &quot;Vestal&quot; resumed her duties. On 6 December 1941, she was moored alongside , at berth F 7, off Ford Island, to provide services to the battleship during her scheduled period of tender upkeep between 6 and 12 December. 

=== Pearl Harbor ===
On December 7 shortly before 08:00 Japanese carrier-based aircraft swept down upon Pearl Harbor. At 07:55, &quot;Vestal&quot; went to general quarters, manning every gun. At about 08:05, her gun commenced firing.

At about the same time, two bombs – intended for the more valuable battleship inboard on Battleship Row – hit the repair ship. One struck the port side, penetrated three decks, passed through a crew&#x27;s space, and exploded in a storage hold, starting fires that necessitated flooding the forward magazines. The second hit the starboard side, passed through the carpenter shop and the shipfitter shop, and left an irregular hole about five feet in diameter in the bottom of the ship.

The gun jammed after three rounds, and the crew was working to clear the jam when an explosion blew &quot;Vestal&quot;&#x27;s gunners overboard. Thereafter, maintaining anti-aircraft fire became secondary to saving the ship. 

At about 08:10, a bomb penetrated &quot;Arizona&quot;″s deck near the starboard side of number 2 turret and exploded in the powder magazine below. The resultant explosion touched off adjacent main battery magazines, exploding the forward part of the battleship and literally clearing &quot;Vestal&quot;″s deck of her crew.

Among those blown overside was her commanding officer, Commander Cassin Young. He swam back to the ship, and countermanded an abandon ship order given by another officer by coolly saying, &quot;Lads, we&#x27;re getting this ship underway.&quot; Fortunately, the engineer officer still had the &quot;black gang&quot; getting up steam.

Oil from the ruptured tanks of the &quot;Arizona&quot; caught fire in the explosion, which in turn set &quot;Vestal&quot; ablaze aft and amidships. At 08:45 men forward cut her mooring lines with axes, freeing her from &quot;Arizona&quot;, and she got underway, steering by engines alone. The naval tug , whose tugmaster had served aboard &quot;Vestal&quot; just a few months before the attack, pulled &quot;Vestal&quot;″s bow away from the inferno engulfing &quot;Arizona&quot; and the repair ship, and the latter began to creep out of danger. In spite of slowly assuming a list to starboard and settling by the stern, she anchored in of water off McGrew&#x27;s Point at 09:10.

Continued flooding caused &quot;Vestal&quot; to settle by the stern and increased the list to six and one-half degrees. At the direction of Commander Young, &quot;Vestal&quot; got underway again at 09:50, less than an hour after the Japanese attack ended. &quot;Vestal&quot; intentionally ran aground at Aiea Bay soon thereafter. Commander Young explained his order to run aground in his after-action report: &quot;Because of the unstable condition of the ship...&quot;, Young explained in his after-action report, &quot;...(the) ship being on fire in several places and the possibility of further attacks, it was decided to ground the ship.&quot; Commander Young was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in saving &quot;Vestal&quot;.

Despite being damaged herself &quot;Vestal&quot; participated in some of the post-attack salvage operations, sending repair parties to the overturned hull of the battleship so that welders could cut into the ship and rescue men trapped there after the battleship capsized.

In the days following the attack, &quot;Vestal&quot;″s men repaired their own ship because yard facilities were at a premium. Within a week of the raid &quot;Vestal&quot;″s crew had pumped out the oil and water that had flooded the compartments below the waterline and cleared out the damaged and gutted holds – all work that had to be completed before the rebuilding process could begin.

=== Tongatapu ===

After repairs and alterations and operations at Pearl Harbor &quot;Vestal&quot; received orders on 12 August 1942 to proceed to the South Pacific. She set sail for Tongatapu in the Tonga Islands. She arrived there two weeks later, on 29 August, less than a month after the launching of Operation Watchtower, the invasion of the Solomon Islands. Over the months that followed the Japanese would contest the Americans and their Australian and New Zealand allies with skill and tenacity.

During &quot;Vestal&quot;″s 60 days at Tongatapu she completed 963 repair jobs for some 58 ships and four shore activities. Included were repairs to warships such as (torpedoed by on 31 August); (damaged from grounding at Lahai Passage, Tonga Islands, on 6 September); and (torpedo damage suffered on 15 September).

==== Repairing USS &quot;South Dakota&quot; ====
One of the more difficult jobs was the one performed on &quot;South Dakota&quot;. The battleship had run aground on an uncharted reef and put into Tongatapu for emergency repairs. &quot;Vestal&quot;″s divers commenced their work at 16:00 on 6 September and began checking the ship&#x27;s seams. With only six divers working, &quot;Vestal&quot;″s party operated until 02:00 on 7 September and reported the damage as a series of splits extending along some of the ship&#x27;s bottom. By the next morning, 8 September, &quot;Vestal&quot;″s skilled repairmen, together with men of the battleship&#x27;s crew, managed to mend the damage sufficiently to allow the ship to return to the United States for permanent repairs.

==== Repairing USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; ====
When &quot;Saratoga&quot; put into Tongatapu after being torpedoed by &quot;I-26&quot; on 31 August, &quot;Vestal&quot;″s divers combined forces with to inspect the damage and later trim and brace the hole. Pumps managed to clear the water out of the flooded fire room and tons of cement were poured into the hole to patch the damaged area. Within 12 days of her arrival at Tongatapu, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was able to return to the United States.

=== Nouméa and the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands ===

==== Repairing USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; ====

&quot;Vestal&quot; subsequently sailed for the New Hebrides on 26 October, though a change of orders brought her to New Caledonian waters instead, and she reached Nouméa on 31 October. Her arrival could not have been more timely, as the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands had taken place just days before, from 25 to 27 October. &quot;South Dakota&quot; and , two of the most heavily damaged ships in the battle, were at Nouméa.

A bomb hit on the latter had buckled a section of the flight deck, aft, bulging it about four feet above deck level. In addition, the hit flooded the after elevator machinery room and blew out bulkheads and damaged furniture in &quot;officer&#x27;s country.&quot; Ordered to sea before the damage was completely repaired, the carrier took with her two &quot;Vestal&quot; officers and a large repair party of 75 Seabees, who continued work even when Enterprise went to battle stations. Those &quot;Vestal&quot; men were included in the Presidential Unit Citation awarded to &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

==== Repairing USS &quot;South Dakota&quot; ====

&quot;South Dakota&quot;, like &quot;Enterprise&quot;, had suffered major damage. She had taken a bomb hit on one of her gun turrets, had been torn by shrapnel, and had collided with the destroyer during the battle. The destroyer had not only holed the battleship&#x27;s starboard side but had left an anchor in the wardroom. Even though &quot;Vestal&quot; repair parties were busy with &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s urgent repairs they also went to work on the damaged &quot;South Dakota&quot;, listing her over to patch the hole on the battleship&#x27;s starboard side at the waterline. Her craftsmen repaired the wardroom (removing &quot;Mahan&quot;″s anchor in the process), patched shrapnel holes, and put sprung hatches and damaged fire mains in order. She was back in action in just five days.

=== Espiritu Santo ===

During her time at Nouméa, &quot;Vestal&quot; completed 158 jobs on 21 ships; she departed that port on 13 November; reached Espiritu Santo three days later; and began a year&#x27;s schedule of repair service. During the next 12 months, &quot;Vestal&quot; tackled some 5,603 jobs on 279 ships and 24 shore facilities. Some of the outstanding repair jobs were on ships damaged during the bitter naval engagements in the Solomons in late 1942 and early 1943. There were: , ripped by heavy caliber hits during the night battle off Savo Island on 13 November 1942; and , the latter with a torpedo hole measuring 24 by , a flooded after engine room, and two propeller shafts broken; the New Zealand light cruiser - already famous for her part in the 1939 Battle of the River Plate and the subsequent sinking of the German pocket battleship &quot;Graf Spee&quot; - which, besides shrapnel and collision damage, had taken a direct hit on her after turret; and the torpedoed and fire-damaged cargo ship .

In addition, she performed repairs on the torpedoed light cruiser , the torpedoed Australian light cruiser ; the bomb-damaged transport ; and others, including and . She also corrected battle damage to and performed alterations on 12 LST&#x27;s and a large number of miscellaneous lesser ships. Only once during that time, from 27 May to 2 June 1943, did the ship herself undergo repairs.

==== Repairing USS &quot;Pensacola&quot; ====
One of the most outstanding pieces of salvage work performed by &quot;Vestal&quot; was for the heavy cruiser , heavily damaged at the Battle of Tassafaronga. A torpedo had caused such extensive damage aft that her stern was barely attached to the rest of the ship and swayed gently with the current. A few frames, some hull plating, and one propeller shaft were practically all that still held the aftermost section to the rest of the ship. As &quot;Vestal&quot;″s commanding officer later recounted, &quot;Never had an AR (repair ship) been presented with such a task; no records on how it should best be done were available.&quot;

By trial and error, and relying on previous experience, &quot;Vestal&quot; workers turned-to. The hole was plugged and braced for stability, compartments that could be were sealed and pumped out; three propellers of about seven tons each were pulled off to reduce drag. &quot;One has to be something of an artificer&quot;, her commanding officer recounted, &quot;... to realize the problems that came up to do with this job, such as underwater welding and cutting, which was still a fairly new thing.&quot; &quot;Vestal&quot;&#x27;s force used a dynamite charge to jar one propeller loose and had to burn through the shaft of another to get it off.

After &quot;Pensacola&quot; came , torpedoed amidships and with of her bow missing. &quot;Vestal&quot; put her in shape, too, for a trip to a stateside yard where permanent repairs could be made. &quot;So it went&quot;, continued the commanding officer, &quot;... one broken, twisted, torpedoed, burned ship after another was repaired well enough to make a navy yard or put back on the firing line.&quot;

=== Funafuti ===

On 18 November 1943, &quot;Vestal&quot; departed Espiritu Santo, bound for the Ellice Islands, and reached her destination, Funafuti, on the 22nd. During her brief stay there the repair ship completed some 604 major repair tasks for 77 ships and for eight shore activities. Her outstanding job during that tour was her work on the light carrier .

=== Marshall Islands ===

Underway for Makin on 30 January 1944, &quot;Vestal&quot;″s orders were changed en route. The ship proceeded instead for the Marshall Islands, reaching Majuro atoll on 3 February. The big repair job awaiting her there was that for the battleship , which had suffered heavy collision damage forward with the . Although estimates called for it to be a 30-day job, &quot;Vestal&quot;, often working 24-hour shifts, completed the task in only 10 days. After that, &quot;Washington&quot; sailed for Pearl Harbor to receive permanent repairs.

In need of repairs herself, especially new evaporators, &quot;Vestal&quot; departed Majuro and sailed, via Pearl Harbor, for the Mare Island Navy Yard. Upon conclusion of those repairs, the addition of new equipment, alterations, a general overhaul, and a vari-colored paint job, &quot;Vestal&quot; departed Mare Island on 8 September, bound for the Carolines. Her voyage took her via Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok. There she picked up tows for the remainder of her voyage, a cement barge, &quot;Chromite&quot;, and the Navy ammunition barge &quot;YF-254&quot;. She reached Ulithi on 15 October 1944.

During the ship&#x27;s sojourn at Ulithi, &quot;Vestal&quot; completed 2,195 jobs for 149 ships – including 14 battleships, nine carriers, five cruisers, five destroyers, 35 tankers, and other miscellaneous naval and merchant ships. Her biggest repair job of that time was the light cruiser , torpedoed off San Bernardino Strait by on the night of 3 November. Once again, &quot;Vestal&quot;″s workers performed their tasks quickly and efficiently, having &quot;Reno&quot; on her way in a short time for permanent repairs in a stateside yard.

=== Saipan and Okinawa ===

Underway for the Marianas on 25 February 1945, &quot;Vestal&quot; arrived at Saipan two days later, to commence what would be over two months of service there, principally repairing amphibious craft used for the Iwo Jima invasion. While &quot;Vestal&quot; lay at anchor at Saipan, the Okinawa invasion commenced on 1 April 1945. Less than a month later, &quot;Vestal&quot; sailed for Kerama Retto, a chain of islands off the southwestern tip of Okinawa, and arrived there on 1 May.

During May, &quot;Vestal&quot; went to general quarters 59 times as Japanese planes made suicide attacks on the ships engaged in the bitter Okinawa campaign. Experience proved that the best defense against the suiciders was a smoke or fog screen produced by all ships that blended into one gigantic mass of low-hanging clouds. For that purpose, &quot;Vestal&quot; had two boats equipped with fog generators and several barrels of oil. Besides the fog generators, smoke pots would be thrown over the bow of the ship to emit a dense, white, sickly-smelling smoke for about 15 minutes apiece. Besides the danger posed by suiciders, deck sentries kept a sharp lookout for any enemy who might attempt to swim out to the ships with mines or explosive charges.

At Kerama Retto, &quot;Vestal&quot;″s big job was repairing destroyers. Her jobs included the kamikaze-damaged and .

&quot;Vestal&quot; remained at Kerama Retto through mid-June before she got underway on the 23d for Nakagusuku Wan, later renamed Buckner Bay, arriving there later that same day. The repair ship remained in that body of water for the remainder of the war. At 20:55 on 10 August 1945, a pyrotechnic display burst forth as word arrived telling that Japan was entertaining thoughts of surrender. &quot;So great was the display of fireworks and so immense the feeling of victory that once the tension had been broken, the true peace announcement received at 0805, 15 August 1945, caused hardly a ripple of enthusiasm: nevertheless the spirit of victory was uppermost in the hearts and conversations of all hands.&quot;

=== Post-World War II service ===

The main danger to the fleet after Japan surrendered was typhoons. &quot;Vestal&quot; had sortied twice from Buckner Bay before &quot;V-J Day&quot; — once on 19 July and once on 1 August. On 16 September, &quot;Vestal&quot; sortied for the third time on typhoon evasion, returning to the harbor the next day after having ridden out winds and heavy seas.

&quot;Vestal&quot; carried out storm-damage repairs over the ensuing days before another typhoon – the fourth for the Ryūkyūs that year – swirled in from the sea on the 28th. Upon receipt of orders from Commander, Service Division 104, &quot;Vestal&quot; weighed anchor and headed out to sea at 15:00, her stem sluicing seaward from Buckner Bay. &quot;The glassy sea, humid atmosphere, and falling barometer portended the approaching engagement between ship and her relentlessly violent foes, sea and wind.&quot;

The merchantmen &quot;Fleetwood&quot; and &quot;Kenyan Victory&quot; took positions astern and in single file with &quot;Vestal&quot; leading the way, steaming westward and away from the threatening blackness massing to the east of Okinawa. Overhauling a four-ship convoy, Captain H. J. Pohl, &quot;Vestal&quot;&#x27;s commanding officer, assumed command of the now seven-ship group. The ships met the fierce winds head-on to lessen the roll and steered to take the surging seas on the quarter, maneuvering skillfully to prevent damage or, worse, loss. By late in the afternoon of the third day, Pohl, the convoy&#x27;s commodore, had his ships back in Buckner Bay, safe and sound.

That particular storm-evasion sortie proved only to be a realistic exercise compared to what came next. On 6 October, &quot;Vestal&quot; received warnings of Typhoon Louise (1945) — a tropical storm in diameter with winds of near the center, moving west-northwest at .

At 00:15 on the 7th, &quot;Vestal&quot; and all ships present in Buckner Bay received word to prepare to execute typhoon plan &quot;X-ray&quot; upon one hour&#x27;s notice. By mid-afternoon, those orders arrived; and the fleet began stirring itself to action for its survival. Among the first vessels to get underway was &quot;Vestal&quot;, the venerable repair ship clearing the harbor entrance at 16:00, steaming due east. Ultimately, and the merchantmen &quot;Hope Victory&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Harbor&quot;, and &quot;Esso Rochester&quot; joined her.

Rising seas, increasing winds, and a plummeting barometer ushered in Monday, 8 October, but &quot;Vestal&quot; and her brood maintained their eastward course through the next day, 9 October – the day when the typhoon struck Okinawa with unparalleled force. At that time, &quot;Vestal&quot; was steering a &quot;crazy-patch course&quot;, eluding the storm that included seas up to high and winds registering between 50 and . Hoping for a possible entry into Buckner Bay on Wednesday, 10 October, &quot;Vestal&quot; headed westerly, bucking strong head winds.

At 14:05 on 10 October, while &quot;Vestal&quot; headed back to Buckner Bay, a signalman on the flying bridge called out: &quot;Life raft on port bow.&quot; &quot;Second life raft on port beam&quot;, came another cry only a few moments later. Barely perceptible several thousand yards to port were tiny specks, rising with the waves – specks which turned out to be the survivors of the sunken that had gone down in the fury of the typhoon during the previous night.

Ordering the other ships to proceed independently, &quot;Vestal&quot; put about to port and shortly thereafter swung to windward of the nearest life raft. In the lee thus formed, the repair ship lowered a motor whaleboat; that craft picked up 17 men from the first raft. Ultimately, 15 more survivors clambered up the boarding nets to safety; a total of two officers and 30 men were recovered from the sea.

Entering Buckner Bay at dusk, &quot;Vestal&quot; witnessed the savage typhoon&#x27;s aftermath with the dawn of the 11th. Once again, &quot;Vestal&quot; immediately turned to the task of repairing the battered ships of the fleet.

Subsequently, &quot;Vestal&quot; performed her vital service functions supporting the occupation of China and Japan, before she sailed back to the United States. Her disposal was delayed in order to allow the ship to perform decommissioning work on other ships referred to the 13th Naval District for disposal, &quot;Vestal&quot; was ultimately decommissioned at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 14 August 1946. Struck from the Navy List on 25 September of the same year, she lay inactive for the next two and one-half years before stripping began on 20 May 1949. Her hull was sold on 28 July 1950 to the Boston Metals Company, Baltimore, Maryland, and subsequently scrapped.

&quot;Vestal&quot; (AR-4) received two battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>Cobh ( ,), known from 1849 until 1920 as Queenstown, is a seaport town on the south coast of County Cork, Ireland. With a population of 14,418 inhabitants at the 2022 census, Cobh is on the south side of Great Island in Cork Harbour and home to Ireland&#x27;s only dedicated cruise terminal. Tourism in the area draws on the maritime and emigration legacy of the town.

Facing the town are Spike and Haulbowline islands. On a high point in the town stands St Colman&#x27;s, the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cloyne. It is one of the tallest buildings in Ireland, standing at 91.4 metres (300 ft).

==Name==
The village on Great Island was known as &quot;Ballyvoloon&quot;, a transliteration of the Irish &quot;Baile Ui-Mhaoileoin&quot; (English: &quot;O&#x27;Malone&#x27;s town&quot;), while the Royal Navy port, established in the 1750s, became known as &quot;The Cove of Cork&quot; or &quot;Cove&quot;. The combined conurbation was renamed to &quot;Queenstown&quot;, in 1849, during a visit by Queen Victoria. The name was changed to &quot;Cobh&quot;, during the Irish War of Independence, following the passing of a motion by the local administrative council on 2 July 1920. &quot;Cobh&quot; is a Gaelicisation of the English name Cove, and it shares the same pronunciation. It has no meaning in the Irish language.

In ancient times the area was known as &quot;Cuan an Neimheadh&quot; (the Harbour of Neimheidh), a figure in medieval Irish legend. Great Island was called &quot;Oileán Ard Neimheidh&quot; (the high or important island of Neimheidh).

==History==
=== Early history ===
According to legend, one of the first colonists of Ireland was Neimheidh, who landed in Cork Harbour over 1,000 years BC. He and his followers were said to have been wiped out in a plague, but the Great Island was known in Irish as &quot;Oilean Ard Neimheadh&quot; because of its association with him. Later it became known as &quot;Crich Liathain&quot; because of the powerful &quot;Uí Liatháin&quot; kingdom, who ruled in the area from Late Antiquity into the early 13th century. The island subsequently became known as &quot;Oilean Mor An Barra&quot; (the Great Island of Barry &amp; Barrymore), after the Barry family who inherited it.
The village on the island was known in English as Ballyvoloon, overlooking &quot;The Cove&quot;. In 1743, the Dublin Castle administration built a fort, later to become known as Cove Fort, to the east of the village. The settlement was first referred to as Cove village in 1750 by Smith the historian who said: &quot;it was inhabited by seamen and revenue officials&quot;. The Cork directory of 1787 shows about thirty businesses in the town, including one butcher and one draper.

The Water Club established at Haulbowline in 1720 was the progenitor of the present Royal Cork Yacht Club (RCYC, now based in Crosshaven) and is the oldest yacht club in the world. The RCYC was based for many years in Cobh and the present Sirius Arts Centre used to be a clubhouse of the RCYC organisation. In 1966, the RCYC merged with the Royal Munster Yacht Club, retaining the name of the RCYC but moving its headquarters to those of the RMYC at Crosshaven at the other side of the harbour.

=== 19th century ===
International upheaval led to Cobh undergoing rapid development in the early 19th century. Due to the natural protection of its harbour setting, the town became important as a tactical centre for naval military base purposes, never more so than at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Today, the Irish Naval Service headquarters is on Haulbowline Island facing Cobh.

The wars against the French led to the town, then usually known as Ballyvoloon or The Cove of Cork, being developed as a British naval port assigned an admiral. Many of the present-day buildings date from this time of build-up. George Brodrick, 5th Viscount Midleton engaged the English architect Decimus Burton to improve the streetscape and buildings during the 1840s. The eventual cessation of hostilities dented Cobh&#x27;s prosperity for a while, but it soon became known as a health resort; many patients stayed here for their health because of the temperate climate. Amongst their number was Charles Wolfe, who wrote &quot;The Burial of Sir John Moore After Corunna&quot;. Wolfe&#x27;s body is buried in the Old Church Cemetery outside the town.

=== The &quot;Titanic&quot; ===

One of the major transatlantic Irish ports, the town was the departure point for 2.5 million of the 6 million Irish people who emigrated to North America between 1848 and 1950. On 11 April 1912, as Queenstown, it was the final port of call for the &quot;Titanic&quot; before she set out across the Atlantic on the last leg of her maiden voyage. She was assisted by the P.S. &quot;America&quot; and the P.S. &quot;Ireland&quot;, two ageing White Star Line tenders, along with several other smaller boats delivering first-class passengers&#x27; luggage. Some sources and local lore suggest that a &quot;Titanic&quot; crew member, John Coffey, a native of Cobh, left the ship at this time, thereby saving his life. 123 passengers boarded at Cobh, with only 44 surviving the sinking.

=== Penal transportation ===
Cobh was earlier a major embarkation port for men, women and children who were deported to penal colonies such as Australia. The Scots Church has since 1973 housed the Cobh Museum which holds records of such deportations in ships&#x27; log books. The Scots Church (a Presbyterian church until its 1969 closure) overlooks the harbour from where so many departed.

=== Shipbuilding ===
A significant shipbuilding industry was developed in the town. The remnants of the Verolme Shipyard today maintain many of the original cranes and hoists now forming part of industrial and maritime heritage. 
The age of steam brought Cobh association with several milestones, including the first steam ship to sail from Ireland to England (1821) and the first steamship to cross the Atlantic (&quot;Sirius&quot; 1838), which sailed from Passage West.

=== RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; and the First World War ===
Another ship to be associated with the town, the Cunard passenger liner , was sunk by a German U-boat off the Old Head of Kinsale while en route from the US to Liverpool on 7 May 1915. 1,198 passengers died, while 700 were rescued. The survivors and the dead alike were brought to Queenstown, and the bodies of over 100 who perished in the disaster lie buried in the Old Church Cemetery just north of the town. The Lusitania Peace Memorial is located in Casement Square, in front of the Arch Building housing the Cobh Library and Tourist Information Centre.
During the First World War, Queenstown was a naval base for British and American destroyers operating against the U-boats that preyed upon Allied merchant shipping. Q-ships (heavily armed merchant ships with concealed weaponry, designed to lure submarines into making surface attacks) were called Q-ships precisely because many were, in fact, fitted out in Queenstown. The first division of American destroyers arrived in May 1917, and the sailors who served on those vessels were the first American servicemen to see combat duty in the war. When that first convoy arrived in port after enduring a rough passage in what were little more than open boats, its members were met by a crowd of sailors and townspeople, thankful for their anticipated help towards stopping the U-boats that were blockading western Europe. Admiral Sir Lewis Bayly, commander of the Coast of Ireland station, met the senior American officer, Commander Joseph Taussig, at the dock and inquired as to how soon the weatherbeaten American ships could be put to use. &quot;We&#x27;re ready now, sir!&quot; was the widely quoted answer from the American.

The United States Navy established U.S. Naval Air Station Queenstown in February 1918. It operated flying boats during the last months of WW1, and closed in April 1919.

Due to its tactical military importance, under the terms of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, the port remained a UK sovereign base within the Irish Free State after 1922. Along with the other Treaty Ports, it was handed over to the government of the Irish Free State in 1938.

==Economy and tourism==

Tourism is a large employer in Cobh. Large cruise liners visit Cobh each year, mainly during the summer months, although many of the tourists are transported out of Cobh by bus to other tourist destinations. In all, almost 100,000 cruise liner passengers and crew arrive in the town each year when their ships berth right in the centre of the town at the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s only dedicated cruise terminal. Tourist attractions are focused on the maritime and emigration legacy of the town and include the &quot;Queenstown Story&quot; at the Cobh Heritage Centre, &quot;Titanic&quot; Experience, &quot;Titanic&quot; Trail walking tour, Cobh Museum, Cobh Road Train, Spike Island tours and St Colman&#x27;s Cathedral. The town has remained largely unchanged since RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; departed from Cork Harbour in 1912, with the streetscape and piers still much the same. Facing the town are Spike Island and Haulbowline Island. The latter is the headquarters of the Irish Naval Service, formerly a British naval base.

Cobh was home to Ireland&#x27;s only steelworks, the former state-owned Irish Steel works which was closed by its buyer, Ispat International (later Mittal Steel Company), in 2001. There is a controversy over the slag heap on the steelworks, where there are concerns that it may be leaching into the harbour. Another important employer in Cobh was the Dutch-owned Verolme Cork Dockyard, in Rushbrooke. It opened in 1960 but ceased operations in the mid-1980s. In 1981 the MV &quot;Leinster&quot; was built at Verolme for service on the Dublin – Holyhead route. The last ship built at Verolme was the Irish Naval Service&#x27;s LÉ &quot;Eithne&quot; (P31). Ship repair work is still carried at Rushbrooke using the drydock and slip way carriages.

In the 21st century, a number of new developments were completed, such as a new retail park at Ticknock in 2008, and a leisure centre (with 25m swimming pool) in August 2007. In 2010, tours of Spike Island commenced, with tours leaving from Kennedy Pier, near the town centre.

==Transport==

===Rail===
Outside of the Dublin metropolitan area, Cobh is one of the few towns in Ireland served by a commuter train service. The town is one of two termini for Cork Commuter Services. The other is Midleton. Regular commuter services run between Cork city and Cobh, calling at, among others, Fota railway station, Carrigaloe railway station, and Rushbrooke railway station, along the way. Trains run every day and the journey time to Cork is under 25 minutes.

Cobh railway station opened, as Queenstown station, on 10 March 1862 and was renamed .

===Air===
The nearest airport is Cork Airport, which can be reached in 20–30 minutes from Cobh via the R624 road and the N25 road.

===Port===
The Port Operations Centre for Cork Harbour is located in the town. The port&#x27;s harbour pilot launches are based at the Camber - a pier and dock area at the eastern end of the town.

===Roads===
Currently there is only a single road (the R624) and road bridge that leads onto Great Island. This road bridge, Belvelly Bridge, was built at Belvelly in 1803 at one of the narrowest points in the channels around Great Island.

===Cross River Ferry===
In 1993 a Cross River Ferry was established which allowed cars and passengers to travel from Glenbrook near Monkstown to Carrigaloe on the Great Island. The crossing from Glenbrook to Carrigaloe takes four minutes and runs daily. Reservations are not required.

==Local government and politics==
In 1862, Queenstown Town Commissioners were established by a local act. In 1899, under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, this body became an urban district council. It was renamed Cobh Urban District in 1920. In 2002, under the Local Government Act 2001, it became Cobh Town Council.

In 2014, this local government body was abolished. Since then, the town has fallen within the responsibility of Cork County Council. Cobh Municipal District, one of eight municipal districts in the county, is represented by six elected councillors. As of the 2019 local election, these include 1 Labour Party, 2 Fine Gael, 1 Fianna Fáil, 1 Green Party and 1 independent councillor.

The town is part of the Dáil constituency of Cork East.

==Arts and culture==

The Sirius Arts Centre is a hub for the arts in Cobh and is located on the waterfront. It hosts cultural events and music concerts both in-house and around Cobh.

The Cobh Peoples Regatta is held every year around August, and includes onstage performances from local musicians and performers as well as a pageant to decide the &#x27;Regatta Queen&#x27;. The festival typically ends with a fireworks display over the harbour.

Cobh was the setting for the 2009 Connor McPherson film &quot;The Eclipse&quot;, and also used as a filming location for the 1999 movie Angela&#x27;s Ashes.

==Education==
Cobh has several primary and secondary schools, including Colaiste Muire secondary school and Carrignafoy Community College. Scoil Iosaef Naofa is a boys&#x27; primary school in the town, and has reached the &quot;Sciath na Scoil&quot; finals (in hurling and gaelic football) on several occasions.

==Sport==
Cobh GAA is the local GAA club, and has a centre for gaelic games at Carrignafoy.

Cobh Pirates RFC are the town&#x27;s rugby union club, and compete at underage and other levels. The club celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2015. They play their home games at &#x27;The Paddocks&#x27; in Newtown, where facilities include a gym, two playing pitches, a training pitch and a rubber training surface. The Cobh Pirates Ladies team was formed circa 2010.

The most noted football team in the area is Cobh Ramblers, where Roy Keane started-out before transferring to English side Nottingham Forest, and Stephen Ireland started his career with the club&#x27;s underage, Springfield Ramblers. Cobh Ramblers play in the League of Ireland First Division, with home games at St Colman&#x27;s Park.

Cobh Golf Club has an 18-hole championship course at Marino on the main R624 road into the town. Cobh is also home to one of the oldest existing tennis clubs in Ireland, Rushbrooke Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club, founded in 1870.

There are two coastal rowing clubs in the area, Cobh Fishermen and Rushbrooke Rowing Club, with the latter established in 1989. Other events on the water include the &quot;Escape from Spike Island&quot; triathlon, which was first held in 2012 and organised by Cobh Triathlon Club. It takes place annually in late summer.

There are two Scouting Ireland groups in Cobh, one of which is a Sea Scout group.

<text>Nowy Sącz (; ; ; ; ) is a city in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship of southern Poland. It is the district capital of Nowy Sącz County as a separate administrative unit. With a population of 83,116 as of 2021, it is the largest city in the Beskid Sądecki Region as well as the third most populous city in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship.

==Names==
Nowy Sącz has been known in German as &quot;Neu Sandez&quot; (older spelling &quot;Neu Sandec&quot;) and in Hungarian as &quot;Újszandec&quot;. The Rusyn name was Novyj Sanc. Its Yiddish names include צאַנז (&quot;Tsanz&quot;) and נײַ-סאַנץ (&quot;Nay-Sants&quot;).

==History==
Nowy Sącz was founded on 8 November 1292 by the Polish and Bohemian ruler Wenceslaus II, on the site of an earlier village named Kamienica. The foundation of Nowy Sącz took place due to the efforts of Bishop of Kraków, , who owned Kamienica. Upon request of the bishop, Wenceslaus II granted it Magdeburg rights, making it the only Polish town founded by the Bohemian king. Its name was taken from the nearby town of Stary Sącz. As early as 1329, the name was spelled Nowy Sandacz.
In the 14th and 15th century Nowy Sącz emerged as one of the most important economic and cultural centres of this part of the Kingdom of Poland. The town benefited from its proximity on the trade route to Hungary due to privileges granted by King Władysław I the Elbow-high, and later his son, Casimir III the Great, for supporting him during the Rebellion of wojt Albert in 1311–1312. During these times, the majority of the town&#x27;s inhabitants were German colonists. In the 15th century it produced steel and woollen products, and nearly rivalled Kraków in visual arts. In 1329, Nowy Sącz signed a treaty with Kraków, upon which Kraków merchants, on their way to Hungary, had to stop at Nowy Sącz; Nowy Sącz merchants, on their way to Gdańsk, were obliged to stay at Kraków. In the mid-14th century, King Casimir the Great built a royal castle here and surrounded the town with a defensive wall. Nowy Sącz was the seat of a castellan and a starosta, becoming an important point in the system of defence of the southern border of Poland. The town was further elevated in 1448 when Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki promoted a local church to the status of a Collegiate. Nowy Sącz was a royal city of Poland, administratively located in the Kraków Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province.

Nowy Sącz prospered in the Polish Golden Age (16th century). It was an important centre of the Protestant Reformation. Local leader of the Polish Brethren, Stanisław Farnowski, was very popular among local nobility. Good times ended in the 17th century. In 1611 a great fire destroyed much of the town, and during the Swedish invasion of Poland, the town was captured by the Swedes (late 1655), who burned and looted it. Nowy Sącz was a centre of the rebellion against the invaders.

===Partitions of Poland===
The decline of the town continued in the 18th century, when Nowy Sącz suffered more destruction during the Great Northern War and the Bar Confederation, when the castle was burned. In 1772, during the First Partition of Poland, the town was annexed by the Habsburg Empire and made part of newly formed Galicia, where it remained until November 1918. Nowy Sącz rose to new prominence in the 19th century when the Austrian authorities built a railway connecting it with Vienna (1880s). Nowy Sącz was the seat of a county, new buildings were opened, the town was a rail hub with a large rail repair shop opened in 1876.

On 17 April 1894, the central part of Nowy Sącz burned in a fire, with a town hall and ancient town records. At that time, the town was important in Hasidic Jewish history for the founding of the Sanz Hasidic dynasty during the 19th century, the precursor to the Bobov dynasty founded in nearby Bobowa (with a synagogue with occasional services by Kraków congregation) and the Klausenberg dynasty.

===World wars===

At the beginning of World War I, Nowy Sącz was occupied by the Russian Army. The Russians were driven back by the Central Powers in December 1914. In the final stages of the war, on 31 October – 1 November 1918, Poles stationed in the Austrian 10th Infantry Regiment in the city and local members of the secret Polish Military Organisation liberated it from Austrian rule, almost two weeks before Poland regained independence. Nowy Sącz and its surroundings, including Nowy Targ and Sanok, were claimed by the Lemko Republic (1918–1920) with capital in Florynka. Within interwar Poland the city saw industrial expansion and the railway factory expanded. In 1936, the Museum of Sącz Land was opened in the restored royal castle. Nowy Sącz had a population of around 34,000 in 1939.
During the invasion of Poland starting World War II, Nazi Germany carried out air raids on 1–2 September 1939, and then German troops entered the city on 6 September. Afterwards, the German &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; entered the city to commit various atrocities against the population, and then its members co-formed the local German police and security forces. Under German occupation the city was made part of the General Government. Poles expelled in December 1939 from several villages in the German-annexed Sieradz County were deported in freight trains to Nowy Sącz, while many locals were among Poles imprisoned in the infamous Montelupich Prison in Kraków and then murdered in the Krzesławice Fort of the Kraków Fortress, as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. Because of its proximity to Slovakia, it lay on a major route for resistance fighters of the Polish Home Army. The Gestapo was active in capturing those trying to cross the border, including the murder of several Polish pilots. In June 1940, the resistance rescued Jan Karski from a hospital there, and a year later 32 people were shot in reprisal for the escape; several others were sent to concentration camps.

The regional Jewish community numbered about 25,000 before World War II, and nearly a third of the town&#x27;s population was Jewish; ninety per cent of them died or did not return. The Nowy Sącz Ghetto for around 20,000 Jewish people was established by the German authorities near the castle. Its inhabitants were deported aboard Holocaust trains to Belzec extermination camp over three days in August 1942 and murdered. Across the river in the Jewish Cemetery, 300–500 Polish people were executed for their participation in the sheltering of Jews. Several Poles were also held by the occupiers in the local prison for helping Jews, before being deported to concentration camps.

The Red Army fought its way into the city on 20 January 1945. The city was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which remained in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. At war&#x27;s end, about 60% of the city had been destroyed. Nowy Sącz was honoured for its heroism with the Cross of Grunwald, third class in 1946. In 1947 much of the Lemko population, living in villages southeast of the town, was deported in Action Vistula (mostly to land recently regained from Germany) in reaction to the nationalist Ukrainian activity in the region.

==Geography==
Nowy Sącz is located at the confluence of the Kamienica River and Dunajec, about north of the Slovak border, in the Sądecka Valley (&quot;Kotlina Sądecka&quot;) at an altitude of . It is surrounded by ranges of the eastern Outer Western Carpathian Mountains: Beskid Sądecki to the south, Beskid Wyspowy to the west, Beskid Niski to the southeast, and the foothills of Pogórze Rożnowskie to the north. The geological basis is Carpathian flysch – an undifferentiated grey-banded sandstone – with alluvial sediment from the Dunajec, Poprad, and Kamienica rivers in the valley basin.

Nowy Sącz is the governmental seat of Nowy Sącz County part of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship, &quot;Województwo Małopolskie&quot; since 1999. Between 1975 and 1998 it was the provincial seat of Nowy Sącz Voivodeship. Before that and during the Second Polish Republic, Nowy Sącz was a county seat in the Kraków Voivodeship. In 1951 it became a town with the rights of a county. It is the historic and tourist centre of &quot;Sądecczyzna&quot;, the Sądecki district.

===Climate===
Nowy Sącz has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;) using the isotherm or a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;) using the isotherm. The climate is temperate, with an average annual rainfall of about .

==Economy==

During the Polish communist regime, Nowy Sącz was the capital of Nowy Sącz Voivodeship (1975–98). In the 1950s the Polish authorities applied a special economic programme for the town, called the &quot;Nowy Sacz Experiment&quot;. The plan was to provide improvement and acceleration of the region&#x27;s economic development, but it was only partially completed. The town was an important centre of the railway industry, and now contains one of the biggest railway engineering works in Poland. Since the social and political changes in Poland that started in 1989, the industry has faced economic problems.

Nowy Sącz is also important in the food industry, specialising in processing fruits, especially apples. Most of the factories were in the Biegonice district. Now the local government is trying to change the structure of the industry, restructuring old factories and encouraging new companies to start up. This initiative also includes a move to the hi-tech industry. Nowy Sącz had one of the first computer companies in Poland, with the largest assembly plant in Europe, but this has closed due to ownership friction with the government. The building trade is also represented in the town, which has a major European window-manufacturer. Like all the bigger towns in Lesser Poland, it has seen a significant influx of the largest European grocery chains.

A main economic problem now is the high level of unemployment which, officially about 20%, is one of the highest in the European Union. Recently the local government has tried to address the persistent economic and social problems of the local Romani community, including access to utilities and education.

==Architecture==

<doc id="386856" wikidata="Q819762" url="?curid=386856" title="Province of Hohenzollern">
<text>The Province of Hohenzollern (, &quot;Hohenzollern Lands&quot;) was a district of Prussia from 1850 to 1946. It was located in Swabia, the region of southern Germany that was the ancestral home of the House of Hohenzollern, to which the kings of Prussia belonged.

The Hohenzollern Lands were formed in 1850 from two principalities that had belonged to members of the Catholic branch of the Hohenzollern family. They were united to create a unique type of administrative district (&quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot;) that was not a true province – a was normally a part of a province – but that had almost all the rights of a Prussian province. The Hohenzollern Lands lost their separate identity in 1946 when they were made part of the state of Württemberg-Hohenzollern following World War II.

== History ==
The Catholic ruling houses of Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen had hereditary treaties with Prussia that went back to 1695 and 1707 respectively. During the German Revolutions of 1848–1849, when the principalities&#x27; future came into question, King Frederick William IV of Prussia was initially reluctant to take them over. His historian and advisor Rudolf von Stillfried-Rattonitz told him that if he did not, the two Swabian princes &quot;would inevitably have to throw themselves into the arms of the 400-year-old House of Württemberg, … [Prussia&#x27;s] hereditary enemy&quot;, a disgrace that the king could not bear. In May 1849 he approved a treaty of annexation that was signed on 7 December 1849; the two princes abdicated the same day. The Prussian state took possession of Sigmaringen on 6 April 1850 and of Hechingen on 8 April. The two former principalities were then merged into one governmental district with administrative headquarters in the town of Sigmaringen.

The Hohenzollern Lands, with a total population of only about 65,500 in 1850, were smaller in size and less populous than any of the full Prussian provinces. The district was subordinate overall to ministries in Berlin, although since it had the status of a province, it was represented in the Prussian State Council (), and its district president was equal to the governors () of Prussian provinces. Many of its administrative functions, however, were the responsibility of the nearby Rhine Province.

During the Austro-Prussia War of 1866, the Hohenzollern Lands were occupied from 27 June to 6 August by troops from Württemberg, which fought with the German Confederation on the losing Austrian side of the war.

In 1875 Prussia established provincial associations (), bodies of local self-government that were above the municipalities and the rural and urban districts, and that replaced the older, lower-level administrative districts. With their formation, the Hohenzollern Lands gained self-government through a , a corporate body under public law for the self-administration of the district and for which a district parliament () was elected. Both remained in existence until 1973. The Hohenzollern Lands&#x27; court of appeal until 1879 was in Arnsberg, about 450 km to the north. After that the Higher Regional Court in Frankfurt am Main was responsible. Its military, higher education system and medical system were under the jurisdiction of the Rhine Province.

The administration of the Sigmaringen district, which performed the tasks of a state government, was initially divided into the seven Hohenzollern upper bureaus () of Gammertingen, Haigerloch, Hechingen, Ostrach, Sigmaringen, Trochtelfingen and Wald. In 1925 the upper administrative districts () Gammertingen, Haigerloch, Hechingen and Sigmaringen were combined to form the two new &quot;Oberämter&quot;, Hechingen and Sigmaringen.

In 1918, following World War I, the Hohenzollern Lands became a province of the Free State of Prussia, and their overall status remained unchanged during the life of the Weimar Republic. In 1933, after the Nazi seizure of power, all provincial functions were de facto suspended and provinces were placed under direct rule. The Hohenzollern Lands belonged to the Nazi Gau (territory) of Württemberg-Hohenzollern under Gauleiter and &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (Reich governor) of Württemberg Wilhelm Murr. The Hohenzollern Lands nevertheless formally remained a Prussian administrative district. 

After World War II the area became part of the French occupation zone. In 1946 the military government united it with the southern part of the former state of Württemberg to form the state of Württemberg-Hohenzollern with Tübingen as its capital. It became part of West Germany when it was established in 1949. The districts of Hechingen and Sigmaringen were retained, even when Württemberg-Hohenzollern was absorbed into Baden-Württemberg in 1952.

The Hohenzollern Lands&#x27; boundaries were lost during the district reform of Baden-Württemberg in 1973. Today the area is divided among nine rural districts (&quot;)&quot; within three administrative districts, all of which include non-Hohenzollern areas. The majority lies in the Sigmaringen and Zollernalbkreis , whose borders partly coincide, especially in the north, with those of the former Hohenzollern Lands.
