<text>The Beaver Wars (), also known as the Iroquois Wars or the French and Iroquois Wars (), were a series of conflicts fought intermittently during the 17th century in North America throughout the Saint Lawrence River valley in Canada and the Great Lakes region which pitted the Iroquois against the Hurons, northern Algonquians and their French allies. 
As a result of this conflict, the Iroquois destroyed several confederacies and tribes through warfare: the Hurons or Wendat, Erie, Neutral, Wenro, Petun, Susquehannock, Mohican and northern Algonquins whom they defeated and dispersed, some fleeing to neighbouring peoples and others assimilated, routed, or killed.

The Iroquois sought to expand their territory to monopolize the fur trade with European markets. They originally were a confederacy of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca tribes inhabiting the lands in what is now Upstate New York along the shores of Lake Ontario east to Lake Champlain and Lake George on the Hudson River, and the lower-estuary of the Saint Lawrence River. The Iroquois Confederation led by the Mohawks mobilized against the largely Algonquian-speaking tribes and Iroquoian-speaking Huron and related tribes of the Great Lakes region. The Iroquois were supplied with arms by their Dutch and English trading partners; the Algonquians and Hurons were backed by the French, their chief trading partner.

The Iroquois effectively destroyed several large tribal confederacies, including the Mohicans, Huron (Wyandot), Neutral, Erie, Susquehannock (Conestoga), and northern Algonquins, with the extreme brutality and exterminatory nature of the mode of warfare practised by the Iroquois causing some historians to label these wars as acts of genocide committed by the Iroquois Confederacy. They became dominant in the region and enlarged their territory, realigning the American tribal geography. The Iroquois gained control of the New England frontier and Ohio River valley lands as hunting ground from about 1670 onward.

Both Algonquian and Iroquoian societies were greatly disrupted by these wars. The conflict subsided when the Iroquois lost their Dutch allies in the colony of New Netherland after the English took it over in 1664, along with Fort Amsterdam and the town of New Amsterdam on the island of Manhattan. The French then attempted to gain the Iroquois as an ally against the English, but the Iroquois refused to break their alliance, and frequently fought against the French in the 18th century. The Anglo-Iroquois alliance would reach its zenith during the French and Indian War of 1754, which saw the French being largely expelled from North America.

The wars and subsequent commercial trapping of beavers was devastating to the local beaver population. Trapping continued to spread across North America, extirpating or severely reducing populations across the continent. The natural ecosystems that came to rely on the beavers for dams, water and other vital needs were also devastated leading to ecological destruction, environmental change, and drought in certain areas. Beaver populations in North America would take centuries to recover in some areas, while others would never recover.

==Background==

French explorer Jacques Cartier in the 1540s made the first written records of the Indians in America, although French explorers and fishermen had traded in the region near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River estuary a decade before then for valuable furs. Cartier wrote of encounters with the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, also known as the &quot;Stadaconan&quot; or &quot;Laurentian&quot; people who occupied several fortified villages, including &quot;Stadacona&quot; and &quot;Hochelaga&quot;. He recorded an on-going war between the Stadaconans and another tribe known as the &quot;Toudaman&quot;.

Wars and politics in Europe distracted French efforts at colonization in the St. Lawrence Valley until the beginning of the 17th century, when they founded Quebec in 1608. When the French returned to the area, they found both sites abandoned by the Stadacona and Hochelaga and completely destroyed, and they found no inhabitants in this part of the upper river valley—although the Iroquois and the Huron used it as hunting ground. The causes remain unclear, although some anthropologists and historians have suggested that the Mohawk Nation of the Iroquois Confederacy destroyed or drove out the St. Lawrence Iroquoians.

Before 1603, Champlain had formed an alliance against the Iroquois, as he decided that the French would not trade firearms to them. The northern Indigenous provided the French with valuable furs, and the Iroquois interfered with that trade. The first battle with the Iroquois in 1609 was fought at Champlain&#x27;s initiative. Champlain wrote, &quot;I had come with no other intention than to make war&quot;. He and his Huron and Algonkin allies fought a pitched battle against the Mohawks on the shores of Lake Champlain. Champlain single-handedly killed two chiefs with his arquebus despite the war chiefs&#x27; &quot;arrowproof body armor made of plaited sticks&quot;, after which the Mohawk withdrew in disarray.

In 1610, Champlain and his French companions helped the Algonquins and the Hurons defeat a large Iroquois raiding party. In 1615, he joined a Huron raiding party and took part in a siege on an Iroquois town, probably among the Onondaga south of Lake Ontario in New York. The attack ultimately failed, and Champlain was injured.

===Dutch competition===
In 1610–1614, the Dutch established a series of seasonal trading posts on the Hudson and Delaware rivers, including one on Castle Island at the eastern edge of Mohawk territory near Albany. This gave the Iroquois direct access to European markets via the Mohawks. The Dutch trading efforts and eventual colonies in New Jersey and Delaware soon also established trade with the coastal Delaware tribe (Lenape) and the more southerly Susquehannock tribe. The Dutch founded Fort Nassau in 1614 and its 1624 replacement Fort Orange (both at Albany) which removed the Iroquois&#x27; need to rely on the French and their allied tribes or to travel through southern tribal territories to reach European traders. The Dutch supplied the Mohawks and other Iroquois with guns. In addition, the new post offered valuable tools that the Iroquois could receive in exchange for animal pelts. they began large-scale hunting for furs to satisfy demand among their peoples for new products.

At this time, conflict began to grow between the Iroquois Confederacy and the tribes supported by the French. The Iroquois inhabited the region of New York south of Lake Ontario and west of the Hudson River. Their lands were surrounded on all sides but the south by Algonquian-speaking tribes, all traditional enemies, including the Shawnee to the west in the Ohio Country, the Neutral Nation and Huron confederacies on the western shore of Lake Ontario and southern shore of Lake Huron to the west, and the Susquehannock to their south. These tribes were historically competitive with and sometimes enemies of the Iroquois, who had Five Nations in their confederacy.

===Beaver Wars begin===

In 1628, the Mohawks defeated the Mohicans, pushing them east of the Hudson River and establishing a monopoly of trade with the Dutch at Fort Orange, New Netherland. The Susquehannocks were also well armed by Dutch traders, and they effectively reduced the strength of the Delawares and managed to win a protracted war with Maryland colonists. By the 1630s, the Iroquois had become fully armed with European weaponry through their trade with the Dutch.

The Iroquois relied on the trade for firearms and other highly valued European goods for their livelihood and survival. They used their growing expertise with the arquebus to good effect in their continuing wars with the Algonquins and Hurons, and other traditional enemies. The French, meanwhile, outlawed the trading of firearms to their Indian allies, though they occasionally gave arquebuses as gifts to individuals who converted to Christianity. The Iroquois attacked their traditional enemies the Algonquins, Mahicans, Montagnais, and Hurons, and the alliance of these tribes with the French quickly brought the Iroquois into conflict directly with them.

The expansion of the fur trade with Europe brought a decline in the beaver population in the region, and the animal had largely disappeared from the Hudson Valley by 1640. &quot;American Heritage Magazine&quot; notes that the growing scarcity of the beaver in the lands controlled by the Iroquois in the middle 17th century accelerated the wars. The center of the fur trade shifted north to the colder regions of southern Ontario, an area controlled by the Neutral and Huron tribes who were close trading partners with the French.

==Course of war==
With the decline of the beaver population, the Iroquois began to conquer their smaller neighbors. They attacked the Wenro in 1638 and took all of their territory, and survivors fled to the Hurons for refuge. The Wenro had served as a buffer between the Iroquois and the Neutral tribe and their Erie allies. The Neutral and Erie tribes were considerably larger and more powerful than the Iroquois, so the Iroquois turned their attention to the north and the Dutch encouraged them in this strategy. At that time, the Dutch were the Iroquois&#x27; primary European trading partners, with their goods passing through Dutch trading posts down the Hudson River. As the Iroquois&#x27; sources of furs declined, however, so did the income of the trading posts.

In 1641, the Mohawks traveled to Trois-Rivières in New France to propose peace with the French and their allied tribes, and they asked the French to set up a trading post in Iroquoia. Governor Montmagny rejected this proposal because it would imply abandonment of their Huron allies.

In the early 1640s, the war began in earnest with Iroquois attacks on frontier Huron villages along the St. Lawrence River in order to disrupt the trade with the French. In 1645, the French called the tribes together to negotiate a treaty to end the conflict, and Iroquois leaders Deganaweida and Koiseaton traveled to New France to take part in the negotiations. The French agreed to most of the Iroquois demands, granting them trading rights in New France. The next summer, a fleet of 80 canoes traveled through Iroquois territory carrying a large harvest of furs to be sold in New France. When they arrived, however, the French refused to purchase the furs and told the Iroquois to sell them to the Hurons, who would act as a middleman. The Iroquois were outraged and resumed the war.

The French decided to become directly involved in the conflict. The Huron and the Iroquois had an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 members each. The Hurons and Susquehannocks formed an alliance to counter Iroquois aggression in 1647, and their warriors greatly outnumbered those of the Iroquois. The Hurons tried to break the Iroquois Confederacy by negotiating a separate peace with the Onondaga and Cayuga tribes, but the other tribes intercepted their messengers and ended the negotiations. During the summer of 1647, there were several small skirmishes between the tribes, but a more significant battle occurred in 1648 when the two Algonquin tribes passed a fur convoy through an Iroquois blockade. They succeeded and inflicted high casualties on the Iroquois. In the early 1650s, the Iroquois began attacking the French themselves, although some of the Iroquois tribes had peaceful relations with them, notably the Oneida and Onondaga tribes. They were under control of the Mohawks, however, who were the strongest tribe in the Confederation and had animosity towards the French presence. After a failed peace treaty negotiated by Chief Canaqueese, Iroquois moved north into New France along Lake Champlain and the Richelieu River, attacking and blockading Montreal. By 1650, they controlled the area from the Virginia Colony in the south up to the St. Lawrence. In the west, the Iroquois had driven the Algonquin-speaking Shawnee out of the Ohio Country and seized control of the Illinois Country as far west as the Mississippi River. In January 1666, the French invaded the Iroquois and took Chief Canaqueese prisoner. In September, they proceeded down the Richelieu but were unable to find an Iroquois army, so they burned their crops and homes. Many Iroquois died from starvation in the following winter. During the following years, the Iroquois strengthened their confederacy to work more closely and create an effective central leadership, and the five tribes ceased fighting among themselves by the 1660s. They also easily coordinated military and economic plans, and they increased their power as a result.

Indian raids were not constant, but they terrified the inhabitants of New France, and some of the heroes of French-Canadian folklore are individuals who stood up to such attacks. Dollard des Ormeaux, for example, died in May 1660 while resisting an Iroquois raiding force at the Battle of Long Sault, the confluence of the St. Lawrence and the Ottawa Rivers, but saved Montreal by his actions. In 1692, 14-year-old Marie-Madeleine Jarret successfully frustrated an Iroquois attack on Fort Verchères.

===Defeat of the Huron===
In 1648, the Dutch authorized selling guns directly to the Mohawks rather than through traders, and promptly sold 400 to the Iroquois. The Confederacy sent 1,000 newly armed warriors through the woods to Huron territory with the onset of winter, and they launched a devastating attack into the heart of Huron territory, destroying several key villages, killing many warriors, and taking thousands of people captive for later adoption into the tribe. Among those killed were Jesuit missionaries Jean Brebeuf, Charles Garnier, and Gabriel Lallemant, each of whom is considered a martyr of the Roman Catholic Church. The surviving Hurons fled and were dispersed from their territory, some taking refuge with the Jesuits at Quebec, some assimilated and adopted by the Iroquois, others joined the Petun or Tobacco nation, another Iroquoian people to become the Wyandot. The Ottawa tribe temporarily halted Iroquois expansion further northwest, but the Iroquois controlled a fur-rich region and had no more tribes blocking them from the French settlements in Canada.

Diseases had taken their toll on the Iroquois and neighbors in the years preceding the war, however, and their populations had drastically declined. To replace lost warriors, they worked to integrate many of their captured enemies by adoption into their own tribes. They invited Jesuits into their territory to teach those who had converted to Christianity. The Jesuits also reached out to the Iroquois, many of whom converted to Roman Catholicism or intermingled its teachings with their own traditional beliefs.

Despite these battles looking like massive successes for the Iroquois, such victories brought issues to the nation. The Iroquois had taken more captives than they could assimilate, which led to divisions and factions within the nation. Many captives held onto their prior beliefs instead of assimilating as well. Large divisions went on to embrace a French alliance and migrated north towards Montreal to trade with the French. The Iroquois accidentally aided the French through their destruction and captivity of the Huron.

===Defeat of the Erie and Neutral===
The Iroquois attacked the Neutrals in 1650, and they completely drove the tribe from traditional territory by the end of 1651, killing or assimilating thousands. The Neutrals had inhabited a territory ranging from the Niagara Peninsula westward to the Grand River valley.

In 1654, the Iroquois attacked the Erie tribe, but with less success. The war lasted for two years, and the Iroquois destroyed the Erie confederacy by 1656, whose members refused to flee to the west. The Erie territory was located on the southeastern shore of Lake Erie and was estimated to have 12,000 members in 1650. The Iroquois were greatly outnumbered by the tribes that they subdued, but they achieved their victories through the use of firearms purchased from the Dutch.

===French counterattack===
The Iroquois continued to control the countryside of New France, raiding to the edges of the walled settlements of Quebec and Montreal. In May 1660, an Iroquois force of 160 warriors attacked Montreal and captured 17 French colonists. The following year, 250 warriors attacked and took ten captives. In 1661 and 1662, the Iroquois made several raids against the Abenakis who were allied with the French. The French Crown ordered a change to the governing of Canada. They put together a small military force made up of Frenchmen, Hurons, and Algonquins to counter the Iroquois raids, but the Iroquois attacked them when they ventured into the countryside. Only 29 of the French survived and escaped; five were captured and tortured to death by the Iroquois. Despite their victory, the Iroquois also suffered a significant number of casualties, and their leaders began to consider negotiating for peace with the French.

The tide of war began to turn in the mid-1660s with the arrival of the Carignan-Salières Regiment, a unit of roughly 1000 regular troops from France and the first group of uniformed professional soldiers in Canada. A change in administration led the government of New France to authorize direct sale of arms and other military support to their Indian allies. In 1664, the Dutch allies of the Iroquois lost control of their colony of New Netherland to the English. In the immediate years after the Dutch defeat, European support waned for the Iroquois. The Onondaga, Seneca and Cayuga reached a peace settlement with the French, however, the Mohawk and Oneida remained unwilling.

In January 1666, Governor Daniel de Rémy de Courcelle attempted to invade the Mohawk homeland. The invasion force of 400 to 500 men briefly skirmished with the Mohawk but failed to reach their villages as the French soldiers were ill-equipped to operate in the cold and deep snow.

The second invasion force was led by Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy whom Louis XIV had appointed as Lieutenant Général of the Americas. The invasion force of about 1,300 men set out September 1666 and reached the Mohawk villages in mid-October. The villages had been hastily abandoned. Tracy ordered the longhouses and fields of crops destroyed, and the expedition returned to New France. A peace settlement was reached with the Mohawk and Oneida in July 1667.

===Peace with France and Iroquois expansion===
Once peace was achieved with the French, the Iroquois returned to their westward conquest in their continued attempt to take control of all the land between the Algonquins and the French. Eastern tribes such as the Lakotas were pushed across the Mississippi onto the Great Plains in the early 18th century, where they adopted the horse culture and nomadic lifestyle for which they later became known. Other refugees flooded the Great Lakes area, resulting in a conflict with existing tribes in the region. In the Ohio Country, the Shawnee and Miami tribes were dominant. The Iroquois quickly overran Shawnee holdings in central Ohio, forcing them to flee into Miami territory. The Miamis were a powerful tribe and brought together a confederacy of their neighboring allies, including the Pottawatomie and the Illini confederation who inhabited Michigan and Illinois. The majority of the fighting was between the Anishinaabeg Confederacy and the Iroquois Confederacy.

The Iroquois improved on their warfare as they continued to attack even farther from their home. War parties often traveled by canoes at night, and they would sink their canoes and fill them with rocks to hold them on the river bottom. They would then move through the woods to a target and burst from the wood to cause the greatest panic. After the attack, they returned to their boats and left before any significant resistance could be put together. The lack of firearms caused the Algonquin tribes the greatest disadvantage. Despite their larger numbers, they were not centralized enough to mount a united defense and were unable to withstand the Iroquois. Several tribes ultimately moved west beyond the Mississippi River, leaving much of the Ohio Valley, southern Michigan, and southern Ontario depopulated. Several Anishinaabe forces numbering in the thousands remained to the north of Lakes Huron and Superior, and they were later decisive in rolling back the Iroquois advance. From west of the Mississippi, displaced groups continued to arm war parties and attempt to retake their land.

Beginning in the 1670s, the French began to explore and settle the Ohio and Illinois Country from the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, and they established the post of Tassinong to trade with the western tribes. The Iroquois destroyed it to retain control of the fur trade with the Europeans. The Iroquois also drove the Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region in 1670, and they claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684, but they acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.

During a raid into the Illinois Country in 1689, the Iroquois captured numerous prisoners and destroyed a sizable Miami settlement. The Miami asked for aid from others in the Anishinaabeg Confederacy, and a large force gathered to track down the Iroquois. Using their new firearms, the Confederacy laid an ambush near South Bend, Indiana, and they attacked and destroyed most of the Iroquois party, and a large part of the region was left depopulated. The Iroquois were unable to establish a permanent presence, as their tribe was unable to colonize the large area, and the Iroquois&#x27; brief control over the region was lost. Many of the former inhabitants of the territory began to return.

====Defeat of the Susquehannocks====
With the tribes destroyed to the north and west, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the Susquehannock. The Susquehannock attained the peak of their influence in the 1650s, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the following decades. In the winter of 1652, the Susquehannock were attacked by the Mohawk, and although the attack was repulsed, it led to the Susquehannock negotiating Articles of Peace and Friendship with Maryland.

An Oneida raid on the Piscataway in 1660 led Maryland to expand its treaty with the Susquehannock into an alliance. The Maryland assembly authorized armed assistance, and described the Susquehannock as &quot;a Bullwarke and Security of the Northern Parts of this Province.&quot; 50 men were sent to help defend the Susquehannock village. Muskets, lead and powder were acquired from both Maryland and New Netherland. Despite suffering a smallpox epidemic in 1661, the Susquehannock easily withstood a siege by 800 Seneca, Cayuga and Onondaga in May 1663, and destroyed an Onondaga war party in 1666.

War between the Iroquois and Susquehannock continued intermittently until 1674 when the Maryland colonists changed their Indian policy, negotiated peace with the Iroquois, and terminated their alliance with the Susquehannocks. Most historians believe that the Haudenosaunee inflicted a major defeat on the Susquehannock since the &quot;Jesuit Relations&quot; for 1675 reports that the Seneca &quot;utterly defeated ... their ancient and redoubtable foes.&quot;

In 1675, the Susquehannock moved south into Maryland. Later that year the militias of Virginia and Maryland besieged the Susquehannock fort, and assassinated the Susquehannock chiefs during a parley. The survivors of the siege were eventually absorbed by the Iroquois.

===Resumption of war with France===
English settlers began to move into the former Dutch territory of upper New York State, and the colonists began to form close ties with the Iroquois as an alliance in the face of French colonial expansion. They began to supply the Iroquois with firearms as the Dutch had. At the same time, New France&#x27;s governor Louis de Buade tried to revive the western fur trade. His efforts competed with those of the Iroquois to control the traffic and they started attacking the French again. The war lasted ten years. 
In 1681, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, negotiated a treaty with the Miami and Illinois tribes. France lifted the ban on the sale of firearms to the Indians, and colonists quickly armed the Algonquin tribes, evening the odds between the Iroquois and their enemies.

With the renewal of hostilities, the militia of New France was strengthened after 1683 by a small force of regular French navy troops in the Compagnies Franches de la Marine, who constituted the longest serving unit of French regular troops in New France. In June 1687, Governor Denonville and Pierre de Troyes set out with a well organized force to Fort Frontenac, where they met with the 50 sachems of the Iroquois Confederacy from their Onondaga council. These 50 chiefs constituted the top leaders of the Iroquois, and Denonville captured them and shipped them to Marseilles, France to be galley slaves. He then travelled down the shore of Lake Ontario and built Fort Denonville at the site where the Niagara River meets Lake Ontario. This site was previously used by La Salle for Fort Conti from 1678 to 1679, and was later used for Fort Niagara which still exists. The Iroquois retaliated by destroying farmsteads and slaughtering entire families. They burned Lachine to the ground on August 4, 1689. Frontenac replaced Denonville as governor for the next nine years (1689–1698), and he recognized the danger created by the imprisonment of the sachems. He located the 13 surviving leaders and returned with them to New France in October 1698.

During King William&#x27;s War (1688–1697), the French formed raiding parties with Indian allies to attack English settlements, (as the English had allied themselves with the Iroquois against the French) perpetrating the Schenectady massacre in the colony of New York, the Raid on Salmon Falls in New Hampshire, and the Battle of Fort Loyal in Portland, Maine. The French and their allies killed settlers in the raids and kidnapped some and took them back to Canada. Settlers in New England raised money to redeem the captives, but some were adopted into the tribes. The French government generally did not intervene when the Indians kept the captives. Throughout the 1690s, the French and their allies also continued to raid deep into Iroquois territory, destroying Mohawk villages in 1692 and raiding Seneca, Oneida, and Onondaga villages. The English and Iroquois banded together for operations aimed against the French, but these were largely ineffective. The most successful incursion resulted in the 1691 Battle of La Prairie. The French offensive was not halted by the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick that brought peace between France and England, ending English participation in that conflict.

==Peace==
The Iroquois eventually began to see the emerging Thirteen Colonies as a greater threat than the French in 1698. The colony of Pennsylvania was founded in 1681, and the continued growth there began to encroach on the southern border of the Iroquois. The French policy began to change towards the Iroquois after nearly fifty years of warfare, and they decided that befriending them would be the easiest way to ensure their monopoly on the northern fur trade. The Thirteen Colonies heard of the treaty and immediately set about to prevent it from being agreed upon. These conflicts would result in the loss of Albany&#x27;s fur trade with the Iroquois and, without their protection, the northern flank of the Thirteen Colonies would be open to French attack. Nevertheless, the French and Indians signed the treaty.

The French and 39 Indian chiefs signed the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. The Iroquois agreed to stop marauding and to allow refugees from the Great Lakes to return east. The Shawnee eventually regained control of the Ohio Country and the lower Allegheny River. The Miami tribe returned to take control of Indiana and northwest Ohio. The Pottawatomie went to Michigan, and the Illinois tribe to Illinois. The peace lasted into the 1720s.

==Aftermath==
In 1768, several of the Thirteen Colonies purchased the &quot;Iroquois claim&quot; to the Ohio and Illinois Country and created the Indiana Land Company to hold the claim to all of the Northwest. It maintained a claim to the region using the Iroquois right of conquest until the company was dissolved in 1798 by the United States Supreme Court.

Many of the Iroquois people allied with the British during the American Revolutionary War, particularly warriors from the Mohawk, Cayuga, Onondaga and Seneca nations. These nations had longstanding trade relations with the British and hoped they might stop American encroachment on their lands. After the Americans emerged triumphant, the British parliament agreed to cede control over much of its territory in North America to the newly formed United States and worked to resettle American loyalists in Canada and provide some compensation for lands the Loyalists and Native Americans had lost to the United States. Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant led a large group of Iroquois out of New York to what became the reserve of the Six Nations of the Grand River in Ontario. The new lands granted to Six Nations reserves were all near Canadian military outposts and placed along the border to prevent any American incursions.

The coalition of Native American tribes, known as the Western Confederacy, was forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day Ohio, in the Treaty of Greenville in 1795.

New France&#x27;s involvement with the Iroquois and other native tribes in the Great Lakes region greatly impacted the future of French colonies, as well as the native tribes in the region. New France was far less profitable and much more violent than Champlain and other French leaders had hoped. The French involvement in native trade caused the French to entangle with complex native alliances, which pitted tribes against the French, and each other. French involvement also introduced disease, weapons, and war, which led to the further destruction of tribes in the region.

<text>The Legion of Honor, formally known as the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, is an art museum in San Francisco, California. Located in Lincoln Park, the Legion of Honor is a component of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (FAMSF), which also administers the de Young Museum. In 2024, the two combined museums were ranked 15th in the Washington Post&#x27;s list of the best art museums in the U.S.

==History and building==
The land on which the Legion of Honor stands was once the city-owned Golden Gate Cemetery, established in 1870 and closed in 1909. It held about 29,000 remains and included a Chinese burial ground and a Potter&#x27;s field.

The Legion of Honor was the gift of Alma de Bretteville Spreckels, wife of the sugar magnate and thoroughbred racehorse owner/breeder Adolph B. Spreckels. After some persuading, Alma convinced Adolph to fund a museum project. To acquire more art and financial support, Alma embarked on to Europe and was successful in requesting donations of fine art from the French government and from Queen Marie of Romania, who donated a replica of her Byzantine Golden Room. 

The building is a full-scale replica, by George Applegarth and Henri Guillaume, of the French Pavilion at the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition, which in turn was a three-quarter-scale version of the (also known as the Hôtel de Salm) in Paris, by Pierre Rousseau (1782). At the close of the exposition, which was located just a few miles away, the French government granted Spreckels permission to construct a permanent replica of the French Pavilion. World War I delayed the groundbreaking until 1921. Dedicated as a memorial to California soldiers killed in the war, the museum opened on Armistice Day, November 11, 1924.

The museum building occupies an elevated site in Lincoln Park in the northwest of the city, with views over the nearby Golden Gate Bridge and the distant downtown skyline.

Between March 1992 and November 1995 the Legion underwent a major renovation that included seismic strengthening, building systems upgrades, restoration of historic architectural features, and an underground expansion that added 35,000 square feet. The Court of Honor was pierced by a pyramidal skylight opening onto the new gallery space below, a quotation in miniature of the Louvre Pyramid. The architects for the project were Edward Larrabee Barnes and Mark Cavagnero.

The plaza and fountain in front of the Legion of Honor is the western terminus of the Lincoln Highway, the first improved road for automobiles across America. The terminus marker and an interpretive plaque are located in the southwest corner of the plaza and fountain, just to the left of the Palace, next to the bus stop. Dominating the classical plaza is &quot;Pax Jerusalemme&quot;, a modern sculpture by Mark di Suvero that stirred controversy at its installation in 2000. In 2023, US president Joe Biden held a state dinner at the Legion of Honor for world leaders, including Chinese president Xi Jinping.
==Collections==

The Legion of Honor displays a collection spanning more than 6,000 years of ancient and European art and houses the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts.

The Hall of Antiquities displays ancient works from Egypt, the Near East, Greece, and Rome, including sculptures, figurines, vessels, jewelry, and carved reliefs. Notable works include a 4,000-year-old carved wood figure of Seneb, an Egyptian royal scribe. The collection is supported in part by the Ancient Art Council, which offers a speakers program focusing on the ancient world.

The museum contains a representative collection of European art, the largest portion of which is French. Its most distinguished collection is of sculpture by Auguste Rodin. Casts of some of his most famous works are on display, including one of &quot;The Thinker&quot; in the Court of Honor. Other artists in the collection include El Greco, Titian, Rubens, Rembrandt, Boucher, David, Tiepolo, Gainsborough and many of the Impressionists and post-Impressionists—Degas, Renoir, Monet, Pissarro, Seurat, Cézanne, van Gogh and others.

The Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts (AFGA) is responsible for the museum&#x27;s collection of works on paper. With more than 90,000 items, the AFGA is the largest repository of works of art on paper in the western United States. The department is named for Moore and Hazel Achenbach, who gave the bulk of their collection to the city of San Francisco in 1948, and the remainder upon Moore Achenbach&#x27;s death in 1963. Many additional acquisitions form the basis for special collections within the department, such as the Anderson Collection of Graphic Arts. Selections from the Logan collection, more than 400 books dating from the nineteenth century to the present, are regularly used in exhibitions in the Reva and David Logan Gallery of Illustrated Books located in a small room off the Hall of Antiquities.

The museum&#x27;s collection of European Decorative Arts includes a gilded Spanish ceiling from c. 1500; numerous items of furniture, including Horace Walpole’s commode of 1763 from Strawberry Hill House, west of London; and three period rooms, including the Salon Doré from the Hôtel de La Trémoille, Paris, said to be the only complete example of a pre-Revolutionary Parisian salon to be displayed anywhere.

The Bowles Porcelain Gallery displays an array of porcelain and pottery from England and continental Europe with a strong emphasis on the eighteenth century. Adjacent to the gallery is the Ceramic Study Center.

The Contemporary Arts Program, which brings the work of living artists into dialogue with the building and the collections, was inaugurated in 2017 with an exhibition of more than 30 works by Urs Fischer installed throughout the museum. Subsequent exhibitions have featured works and interventions by artists including Lynn Hershman Leeson, Julian Schnabel, Alexandre Singh, and Wangechi Mutu.

Situated off the northwest corner of the Legion grounds is the &quot;Holocaust Memorial&quot;, a sculptural group of white-painted bronze by George Segal installed in 1984. Although not part of the Legion&#x27;s collection, the sculpture is often seen by visitors to the museum.


==Spreckels Organ and Gunn Theater==
In 1924, John D. Spreckels commissioned the Ernest M. Skinner Company of Boston to build the symphonic organ, which is centrally located in the Spreckels Gallery (gallery 10). It was designed to blend into the museum&#x27;s structure; its 4,500 pipes are not visible to visitors, hidden behind the &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; ceiling painted to resemble a marble apse. Organ concerts are performed every Saturday at 4:00 p.m.

The 316-seat James A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Theater, located downstairs off the Hall of Antiquities, is a venue for chamber music concerts by the San Francisco Symphony and for lectures and other programs. Architect George Applegarth designed the circular theater and decorated it in the style of Louis XVI. The descending entrance stairways on either side are decorated with portraits by Nicolas de Largillière. The ceiling mural is &quot;The Apotheosis of the California Soldier&quot; by Spanish artist Julio Vila y Prades.

==Film appearances==
*In the 1952 thriller &quot;Sudden Fear&quot;, Lester Blaine (Jack Palance) and Irene Neves (Gloria Grahame) have a clandestine rendezvous at a Bach organ recital at the Legion of Honor.
*The museum plays a major part in the Alfred Hitchcock movie &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958) when Scottie (played by James Stewart) follows Madeleine Elster (played by Kim Novak) to the museum, where she stares at one painting for a considerable time. The painting, a portrait of the fictitious Carlotta Valdes, was a prop created specifically for the production by artist John Ferren and is not housed at the museum.
*The character Dr. Crippen (played by Signe Hasso) in &quot;The Black Bird&quot;, a 1975 comedy sequel to &quot;Maltese Falcon&quot;, has an office in the Legion of Honor.
*The exterior of the museum appears in several scenes in Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Raising Cain&quot; (1992).
*The Legion of Honor appears in the 1993 miniseries &quot;Tales of the City&quot;, based on the first of the &quot;Tales of the City&quot; series of novels by Armistead Maupin. The character of Mary Ann Singleton (played by Laura Linney) arranges to meet her neighbor Norman Neal Williams (played by Stanley DeSantis) at the museum.

<doc id="384163" wikidata="Q1421950" url="?curid=384163" title="Welcome Back, Kotter">
<text>Welcome Back, Kotter is an American sitcom starring Gabe Kaplan as a high-school teacher in charge of a racially and ethnically diverse remedial education class nicknamed the Sweathogs. Recorded in front of a live studio audience, the series aired on ABC from September 9, 1975, through May 17, 1979. It provided John Travolta with his breakthrough role.

== Premise ==
Stand-up comedian and actor Gabriel &quot;Gabe&quot; Kaplan stars as the main character, Gabe Kotter, a wise-cracking teacher who returns to his alma mater - James Buchanan High School in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, New York City - ten years after graduating, to teach a remedial class of loafers known as the Sweathogs. The rigid vice principal, Michael Woodman (John Sylvester White), who was formerly Kotter&#x27;s social studies teacher, dismisses the Sweathogs as witless hoodlums. Woodman only expects Kotter to contain them until they drop out or are expelled or arrested. Kotter had been a remedial student and a founding member of the original class of Sweathogs. He befriends the current class and stimulates their potential. Kotter forms a rapport with his students. They begin visiting his Bensonhurst apartment, sometimes via the fire escape window, often to the chagrin of his wife Julie (Marcia Strassman).
The fictional James Buchanan High is based on the Brooklyn high school that Kaplan attended in real life, New Utrecht High School, which is shown in the opening credits. Many of the show&#x27;s characters were based on people Kaplan knew during his teen years as a remedial student, several of whom were described in one of Kaplan&#x27;s stand-up comic routines &quot;Holes and Mellow Rolls&quot;. 
The character Vinnie Barbarino was inspired by Eddie Lecarri and Ray Barbarino; the character Freddie &#x27;Boom Boom&#x27; Washington was inspired by Freddie &quot;Furdy&quot; Peyton; the character Juan Epstein was partially inspired by Epstein &quot;The Animal&quot;; and the character Arnold Horshack was inspired by someone of the same name.

== Characters ==

=== Gabe Kotter ===
*Played by Gabe Kaplan
Gabe Kotter is a flippant but well-meaning teacher who returns to teach at the high school he attended as a student. He is assigned to a class of remedial students known as the Sweathogs. Kotter has a unique insight of the potential of these purportedly &quot;unteachable&quot; pupils, as well as the difficulties and scrutiny they encounter on a daily basis, as he was a &quot;founder member&quot; of the original Sweathogs.

Kotter is married to Julie throughout the series; they eventually have twin girls, Robin and Rachel. It is confirmed by Julie in the episode &quot;Follow the Leader (part 1)&quot; that Gabe is Jewish.

During season four, Gabe Kaplan had contract issues with the executive producer, which resulted in Kotter&#x27;s character appearing in only a handful of episodes. In season four, the invisible principal John Lazarus retires, and Kotter becomes the vice-principal. Though he is said to maintain some social studies training duties, most of that season&#x27;s shows are filmed outside his classroom or, if inside it, Mr. Woodman is teaching. To minimize Kotter&#x27;s absence, scenes were shot in either the school&#x27;s hallway, the schoolyard, or the principal&#x27;s waiting area. Season four ended the series.

=== Julie Kotter ===
*Played by Marcia Strassman
Julie Kotter is Gabe Kotter&#x27;s wife and closest friend. Though she has a sense of humor, she often wishes Gabe would take matters more seriously. She is occasionally upset with the amount of time he devotes to his students (inside and outside of the school), and she is troubled that he allows them to visit their apartment regularly. In the two-part story &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;, the Sweathogs&#x27; constant intrusions lead Julie to separate briefly from Gabe and even seriously consider divorce. Mrs. Kotter is originally from Nebraska and holds a college degree in anthropology. She eventually becomes a secretary at Buchanan High School, and later a substitute teacher after Gabe&#x27;s promotion to vice-principal. She makes several references to her &quot;world famous tuna casserole&quot;, a common meal at the Kotter dinner table, which Gabe and the Sweathogs deem inedible.

=== Michael Woodman ===
*Played by John Sylvester White
Michael Woodman is the curmudgeonly vice-principal (and later principal) of Buchanan High. He makes no secret of his dislike for the Sweathogs, whom he considers the bottom of the social stratum at his school. He refers to non-Sweathogs as &quot;real&quot; students. When Kotter was a student at Buchanan High, Woodman taught social studies, the same class Kotter returns to teach. The students regularly joke about Woodman&#x27;s advanced age, and sometimes his diminutive height. Woodman opposes Kotter&#x27;s unorthodox teaching methods. At one point he even puts Kotter in front of the school&#x27;s review board in an unsuccessful attempt to have him fired. As the series progresses, Woodman begins to tolerate Kotter and the Sweathogs marginally. In a season one episode, Woodman is shown to be a gifted teacher, willing to wear historic costumes and role-play in front of the class during his lessons.

=== Vincent &quot;Vinnie&quot; Barbarino ===
*Played by John Travolta
Vinnie Barbarino is a cocky Italian-American, the &quot;unofficial official&quot; leader and resident heartthrob of the Sweathogs. He has a need to be the center of attention, as seen when he admits to making it rain in the school gymnasium. In the two-episode &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;, Barbarino quits the Sweathogs and drops out of school in anger when Freddy Washington is chosen as the &quot;leader&quot; of the group, though he returns as leader at the conclusion of the episode. Barbarino&#x27;s prowess with women is sometimes a source of envy and more often, amusement among his classmates. On occasion, he breaks out in a song about his last name sung to the tune of the Beach Boys song &quot;Barbara Ann&quot;. He was the first of the Sweathogs to move out on his own, when he got a job as a hospital orderly. In the first episode of the series&#x27; fourth season, he has a girlfriend, Sally. Vinnie is Catholic and often describes his mother Margie as a saint. He is a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan. Little is known about Vinnie&#x27;s home life, other than that his parents frequently argue and take turns beating him when in a mutual rage. He shares a bed with his younger brother. The character is seen less frequently in season 4, appearing in only 10 of the first 15 episodes of the season; he then exits the series entirely.

=== Arnold Dingfelder Horshack ===
*Played by Ron Palillo
The class clown of the Sweathogs, Horshack is completely comfortable with his oddball, if naïve, personality. Horshack was known for his unique observations and his wheezing laugh, similar to that of a hyena. It is possible that academically he is the smartest Sweathog. He is the only central Sweathog character to be promoted out of a remedial academics class, but he soon returns after feeling out of place. He has an affection for acting and enjoys old movies, particularly 1930s musicals. He eventually marries Mary Johnson, a co-worker and fellow Sweathog. Although his surname sounds like a term for a brothel, he claims it is a &quot;very old and respected name&quot; meaning &quot;the cattle are dying.&quot; His middle name (and his mother&#x27;s maiden name) is Dingfelder.

=== Freddie Percy &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Washington ===
*Played by Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs
Freddie Washington is the hip black student known as the athletic Sweathog for his skills on the basketball court (although in the episode &quot;Basket Case&quot;, Mr. Kotter almost beats Freddie in a one-on-one game). Washington claimed his nickname came from his habit of &quot;pretending to play the bass&quot; and singing &quot;Boom-boom-boom-boom!&quot;. His trademark phrase is, &quot;Hi, there&quot; (spoken with a deep voice and a broad smile) and he calls Mr. Kotter &quot;Mister Kot-&quot;TAIR&quot;&quot;. Though often the voice of reason among his classmates, Washington nonetheless is a willing participant in the Sweathogs&#x27; various antics and pranks. He also finds success as a radio disc jockey along with another former Sweathog, Wally &quot;The Wow&quot; Wexler (played by George Carlin). At one point, Washington challenges Barbarino for leadership of the Sweathogs and even replaces him for a time until the group grows tired of his dictatorial style.

Washington has an older sister, who got divorced twice while living in Vermont and a brother, Leroy. He has another brother, Douglas, and his father&#x27;s name is Lincoln, portrayed by R&amp;B singer Carlton &quot;King&quot; Coleman. Kotter reveals details of his own past to bond with Washington, because, in addition to being a former Sweathog he was also a former star of Buchanan&#x27;s basketball team.

=== Juan Luis Pedro Felipo de Huevos Epstein ===
*Played by Robert Hegyes
Epstein is a fiercely proud Puerto Rican Jew. When asked if his mother was Puerto Rican, Juan replies that his mother&#x27;s maiden name was Bibbermann and that his grandfather &quot;saw Puerto Rico from the ship as he was making his way to America and decided to settle there instead of Miami&quot;, making him one of the earliest Puerto Rican Jews. Juan is thus Puerto Rican on his father&#x27;s side and Jewish on both parents&#x27; sides.

He is one of the toughest students at Buchanan High, despite his short stature. He normally walks with a tough-man strut and was voted &quot;Most Likely to Take a Life&quot; by his peers. In season one of the series, Epstein is said to be the sixth of ten children (when speaking on the phone to his mother, who had failed to notice that he had been missing for three days, she apparently failed to recognize his name and he had to further identify himself as &quot;Number Six&quot;), although in a later episode, he mentions that his mother only gave birth eight times, implying two of them were twin births. Only four of his siblings are mentioned by name: his brothers Pedro, Irving, and Sanchez (establishing that some of his siblings had Jewish names and others Puerto Rican names) and a younger sister, Carmen. Epstein&#x27;s toughness is downplayed in later episodes, and he became more of a wiseguy. He was also known to have a &quot;buddy&quot; relationship with Principal Lazarus, as he often referred to him by his first name, Jack. On a few occasions, when Kotter performs his Groucho Marx impersonation, Epstein would jump in and impersonate Chico Marx or Harpo Marx. Epstein&#x27;s diminutive height, large hair, and fake excuse notes (always signed &quot;Epstein&#x27;s Mother&quot;) were running gags.

=== Recurring characters ===
==== Rosalie &quot;Hotsie&quot; Totsie ====
*Played by Debralee Scott
Rosie Totsie is the femme fatale purported to have put the &quot;sweat&quot; in Sweathog, though her reputation is largely exaggerated by the Sweathogs&#x27; word of mouth. Her promiscuity is at least in part a reaction to the strict discipline enforced by her father, the Reverend Totsie. To restore her good name, and to prove a point, she fabricates a story about one of the Sweathogs getting her pregnant. The character was a favorite among male viewers but was phased out of the series at the end of the first season when Scott was picked to co-star in the syndicated Norman Lear comedy &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot;. She reprised the role in its third season in a 1978 episode, &quot;The Return of Hotsie Totsie&quot;, in which it was revealed that she dropped out of school because she became pregnant and had to become a stripper to support her infant child.

==== Judy Borden ====
*Played by Helaine Lembeck
A recurring non-Sweathog character in the earlier seasons, Borden is a straight-&quot;A&quot; student and editor of the &quot;Buchanan Bugle&quot;, the school newspaper. She was Barbarino&#x27;s tutor, and even dated him at one time. Despite her academic superiority, she can easily hold her own in a Dozens contest against any Sweathog.

==== Beauregarde &quot;Beau&quot; De LaBarre ====
*Played by Stephen Shortridge
Introduced as a regular character in the fourth and final season, Beau is a handsome, friendly, blond, silver-tongued southerner who transfers from New Orleans after being kicked out of several other schools. He ends up in Kotter&#x27;s class. The producers sought a heartthrob who was not a direct knock-off of the &quot;Italian Stallion&quot; trend that was permeating Hollywood in the mid-1970s, and who would improve ratings in the South, where the show&#x27;s New York setting was seen as unrelatable. They wanted to retain female viewers but avoid a Travolta clone. Beau&#x27;s first reaction to the term &quot;Sweathog&quot; was &quot;That sounds gross.&quot; He seems to have a way with women, as shown in later episodes. One of his running jokes involves imparting esoteric and nonsensical sayings, such as &quot;a real man never steps on a pregnant alligator&quot;.

== Other recurring characters ==
*Vernee Watson as Verna Jean Williams, Freddie&#x27;s girlfriend.
*Susan Lanier as Bambi, a female addition to the Sweathogs.
*Charles Fleischer as Carvelli, introduced as a student foil to the Sweathogs in Season 2.
*Bob Harcum as Murray, Carvelli&#x27;s loyal, and extremely dim, sidekick.
*Dennis Bowen as Todd Ludlow, a nerdy academic high achiever.
*Irene Arranga as Mary Johnson, later became Arnold Horshack&#x27;s wife.
*Melonie Haller as Angie Grabowski, introduced in Season 3 as the only official female Sweathog, but was gone by the end of the season.

== Show history ==
&quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;″s first season was controversial. In Boston, the local ABC affiliate (WCVB-TV) initially refused to air the show. The city was going through a tumultuous school busing program that involved widespread protests and riots, and the local affiliate felt Kotter&#x27;s fictional integrated classroom would exacerbate the situation. The show became an early ratings success, however, and the affiliate relented, picking it up from its fifth episode.

Teachers in other cities had concerns about how Kotter would be portrayed, so producers allowed a union representative on the set to ensure the show protected the image of those in the profession. Kaplan opposed the idea, at one point asking a reporter if there was a junkman on the set of &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; to protect the reputation of junkmen.

Censor concerns about depiction of juvenile delinquency faded after the Sweathogs&#x27; antics proved to be silly rather than criminal. Like Kaplan, Hegyes was a fan of the Marx Brothers. Hegyes claimed that he suggested that the Sweathogs be modeled after the Marx Brothers in order to reduce tension.

Ratings slipped greatly in the third season. Kaplan later attributed the decline to the age of the actors playing the Sweathogs, all then in their mid- to late-twenties, claiming that they were no longer believable as high school students. As the series entered its fourth and final season, Travolta, the youngest Sweathog, was 25—while Palillo, the oldest, would turn 30 before season&#x27;s end.

Kaplan&#x27;s idea to bring the show in line with the age of its cast was to have Kotter join the faculty of a community college attended by the Sweathogs, but this storyline never materialized. In order to increase viewership, the Kotters had twin girls, but this did not prove to be enough to regain the show&#x27;s earlier momentum. The show introduced a female Sweathog, Angie Grabowski, played by Melonie Haller.

Major changes took place in the fourth and final season. Shortly before the season began, the series was moved from its successful Thursday 8:00 p.m. time slot to Monday 8:00 p.m. to make way for the impending hit series &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;. Much of the writing staff turned over after season 3, and Travolta, who had already starred in box office hits such as &quot;Carrie&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, and &quot;Grease&quot;, and began to focus more time on his film career. He appeared in ten episodes, earning $2,000 (roughly $ now) for each one, and he was billed as a &quot;special guest star&quot;. Vinnie got a job as a hospital orderly and his own apartment and the Murphy Bed that came up and down at inopportune times became a running gag. Mr. Woodman was promoted to Principal of the school (Principal Lazarus quit to take a &quot;less stressful&quot; job at a high-security prison), and Kotter was promoted to Vice-Principal, purposely moving the show&#x27;s focus away from Kotter&#x27;s class. Major off-screen disputes led Kaplan to break his contract and reduce his appearances. To help fill the voids, Stephen Shortridge joined the cast as smooth-talking Southerner Beau De LaBarre, and Kotter&#x27;s wife, Julie, became a school secretary and occasional fill-in teacher, despite having one-year-old twin daughters. Also in season 4, Della Reese was introduced as English teacher and Buchanan High talent show coordinator Mrs. Jean Tremaine.

Knowing the series was in a nosedive, producer James Komack attempted to spin off a newly married Arnold Horshack into a new sitcom .

== Popularity ==

The show enjoyed ratings success during its first two seasons, spawning a host of merchandising tie-ins, including lunchboxes, dolls, trading cards, comic books, novels, and even a board game, advertised as &quot;The &#x27;Up Your Nose With A Rubber Hose&#x27; Game&quot; in a commercial with a class full of Sweathog look-alikes featuring Steve Guttenberg as Barbarino and Thomas Carter as Boom Boom Washington. The Sweathogs — or at least an impressionist&#x27;s version of them — even made a crossover appearance with characters from the &quot;Happy Days&quot; universe on one track (the disco-themed &quot;Fonzarelli Slide&quot;) of a 1976 TV-promoted oldies compilation album.

In 2010, the cast, including Gabe Kaplan, Marcia Strassman, John Travolta, Robert Hegyes, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, and Ellen Travolta were honored at the TV Land Award ceremonies. Co-star Ron Palillo was not in attendance, nor were fellow co-stars John Sylvester White (who died in 1988) and Debralee Scott (who died in 2005).

== Theme song ==

The popular theme song, &quot;Welcome Back&quot;, written and recorded by John Sebastian, former front-man for the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, became a No. 1 hit in the spring of 1976. The show was originally going to be called &quot;Kotter&quot;, but that was changed because of the theme song lyrics. Sebastian has said he tried to find a more general theme for the song after being unable to find any reasonable rhymes for &#x27;Kotter&#x27;.

== Merchandising ==
=== Comic books ===
DC Comics published ten issues of a &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; comic book starting in 1976. Following its cancellation in 1978, a &quot;Limited Collectors&#x27; Edition&quot; was issued, incorporating a four-page &quot;On the Set&quot; section and photographs from the show.

=== Novels ===
A series of novels based on characters and dialog of the series was written by William Johnston and published by Tempo Books in the 1970s.

=== Action figures ===
Mattel produced a series of 9-inch &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; action figures in 1977. Figures produced included Barbarino, Horshack, Epstein, Washington, and Mr. Kotter.

== Episodes ==

== Home media ==
Warner Home Video released a 6-episode Television Favorites collection on February 28, 2006. Due to the success of this release, Warner released the Complete first Season on DVD in Region 1 on June 12, 2007.

On May 7, 2014, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series. Ultimately, they released &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on August 26, 2014, and have since released the second, third, and fourth seasons as individual sets.

As of April 2023, the entire series is available to stream on Tubi.

== Nominations ==
&quot;Kotter&quot; failed to win any major awards, though it was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1976 after its first season; it lost to &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. The series was also nominated for three technical Emmy Awards: Outstanding Achievement in Videotape Editing for a Series (to Editors Susan Jenkins and Manuel Martinez) in 1976, Outstanding Art Direction for a Comedy Series (to Art Directors Roy Christopher and James Shanahan) in 1978, and Outstanding Individual Achievement — Creative Technical Crafts (to Dick Wilson for sound effects) in 1979.

== Guest stars ==
Several noteworthy performers enjoyed guest stints on Kotter either during or prior to their widespread fame. James Woods guest starred in the first episode of Season 1 (&quot;The Great Debate&quot;) as Alex Welles, a drama teacher who leads the school debate team (&quot;the Turkeys&quot;) in a competition against the Sweathogs. Pat Morita appears in the 1976 episode &quot;Career Day&quot; as Mr. Takahashi. Comedian George Carlin was featured, as was John Astin. Other guest stars included Scott Brady, Ellen Travolta, Richard Moll, Della Reese, and Dinah Manoff who would work with John Travolta again in &quot;Grease&quot;.

Groucho Marx was set to have a brief walk-on role in one episode. He arrived on-set, but was deemed to be too sick to appear. Pictures of Marx with the cast were taken, but not released. However, the photographs did appear on the Internet decades later.

== Spin-offs ==
At least three spin-offs of &quot;Kotter&quot; were seriously considered, but only one ever became a series. The short-lived &quot;Mr. T and Tina&quot; starred Pat Morita as Taro Takahashi (Mr. T for short), a brilliant Japanese inventor whom he portrayed in one episode of &quot;Kotter&quot;. The show was not received well by critics and lasted for five episodes on ABC. There was also talk of developing a spin-off built around the Horshack character and his family, &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man; Horshack!&quot;, but it never went beyond the backdoor pilot stage, shown as an episode of &quot;Kotter&quot;. In the mid-1990s, Hegyes announced on &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; that plans were in the works to create a spin-off featuring the Sweathogs, all grown up, minus Travolta&#x27;s Barbarino, but the project never got off the ground and little information about it was ever made public.

== Broadcast history and Nielsen ratings ==
== International airing ==

*In Germany, 23 episodes of &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; were shown dubbed, but under its original title – first from September 1979 until May 1980 by the ZDF, then again from April to July 1985 by Sat.1.
*In the United Kingdom, 26 episodes were shown from December 1981 until July 1983 on ITV.
*In Australia, the show was broadcast on The Seven Network from June 1976 and rated very well for the first two seasons.
*In New Zealand, the show was screened on Television New Zealand&#x27;s TV ONE. As in Australia, the first two seasons rated highly.
*In Italy, the show was aired by the Italian TV second channel Rai 2 in the spring of 1980. Since at the time there were only two national TV networks, the rating was high. The show was dubbed, and the title was translated in Italian into &quot;I Ragazzi del Sabato sera&quot; (&quot;Saturday Night Guys&quot;), clearly aiming to build on the success of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; by presenting the show as some sort of prequel.
*In Greece, the show was screened on ANT1 in the summer of 1992, on a morning slot (07:30).

== After the show ==
Kaplan welcomed back Hegyes and Jacobs on his short-lived 1981 sitcom &quot;Lewis &amp; Clark&quot;. Their characters joked that Kaplan seemed familiar and, being a smart guy, &quot;should become a teacher.&quot;

In 1997, Ron Palillo, Robert Hegyes, and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs reprised their respective roles in a dream sequence in the &quot;Mr. Rhodes&quot; episode &quot;The Welcome Back Show&quot;.

In 2012, both Ron Palillo and Robert Hegyes died. Other members of the cast who have died include Marcia Strassman in 2014, John Sylvester White in 1988, and Debralee Scott in 2005. , Gabe Kaplan, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs and John Travolta are the only main actors still living.

=== Early years ===

Theobald was the eldest son of Theobald I of Navarre and his third wife, Margaret of Bourbon. He succeeded to his father&#x27;s titles on his death at only fourteen years of age. His mother acted as regent with James I of Aragon until 1256, when Theobald came of age. On 27 November, he affirmed the Fueros of Navarre, which limited his power by putting him under the counsel of a tutor from among the aristocracy. He could not make judgements without a council of twelve (a jury) of noblemen. Theobald was not content, however, to be so restricted in royal prerogative before his twenty-first birthday. He received the rites of unction and coronation from Pope Alexander IV in 1257 and 1259 respectively and tried to justify his divine right to rule, a concept foreign until that point in Navarrese politics.

=== Domestic policy ===

In order to counter the tendency to decentralisation, diminish the power of the nobility, and evade the control of the fueros on him, Theobald turned to the bourgeoisie. He exacted extraordinary taxes and imposts from them, but they supported him nevertheless because he granted them rights, prestige, and political clout. He extended the &quot;fueros&quot; of Pamplona to Lantz and Estella to Tiebas—nowadays in ruins and depopulated—and Torralba Del Río. He founded Espinal (Aurizberri, near Roncesvalles) in 1269.

Theobald continued the power struggle with the bishop of Pamplona started during his father&#x27;s reign. The former stood by his native Basque parishioners of the Navarreria borough, while Theobald championed the Saint Nicolas borough of Pamplona, made up of Occitans hailing from southern France. Eventually he tried to put an end to the fights between boroughs in 1266, pushing an agreement among the councils of the three Pamplonese boroughs—not that it avoided ultimately the destructive war of the Navarreria in 1276.
In other affairs, Theobald continued the policies of his father. He improved the royal administration, of incomes and expenditures, and administered the first census. The count of 1266 indicated a population of 150,000 inhabitants in Navarre. Approximately 6.75% of royal revenues were spent on a bureaucracy, 33.84% on the military, and 59.6% to the maintenance of the monarch and his household and duties.

=== French alliance ===

Theobald found support in Louis IX of France, who supported his fellow kings against their vassals with consistency. Theobald married Isabella, Louis&#x27;s daughter, on 6 April 1255. Theobald acted as an advisor of Louis and Louis as an arbiter in Navarre&#x27;s internal problems. When Alfonso X of Castile&#x27;s daughter Berengaria was betrothed to Louis IX of France&#x27;s son Louis, Castile ceded the use of the ports of Fuenterrabía and San Sebastián to Navarre on 1 January 1256.

In July 1270, Theobald embarked with his father-in-law on the Eighth Crusade to Tunis. Louis died of dysentery at the siege. Theobald died childless at Trapani in Sicily while returning that same year. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry I. His widow Isabella returned home to France, where she died a few months later and was buried at Provins.

<text>DoCo is a pop group composed of five female &quot;Ranma ½&quot; voice actresses. The performances are done in-character. DoCo has released three albums: &quot;DoCo★First&quot;, &quot;DoCo☆Second&quot;, and &quot;DoCo Original Karaoke&quot;. Some of the songs were translated and performed in English by DoCo U.S.A., the corresponding English language voice actors. Some of their songs were used as the opening and ending themes for the &quot;Ranma ½&quot; OVA, as well as in music videos that accompanied the OVAs. A few songs (such as the DoCo version of CoCo&#x27;s &quot;Equal Romance&quot;) also appear on various &quot;Ranma ½&quot; musical albums.

DoCo is in some sense a parody of CoCo. As &quot;CoCo&quot; can be taken to mean (koko, here), &quot;DoCo&quot; can be taken to mean (doko, where?).

<doc id="384176" wikidata="Q2659344" url="?curid=384176" title="Military history of Canada">
<text>The military history of Canada spans centuries of conflicts within the country, as well as international engagements involving the Canadian military. The Indigenous peoples in Canada engaged in conflicts over territory and resources for millenia. The arrival of European settlers in the 17th century led to new alliances and hostilities among Indigenous nations and colonial powers, leading to conflicts such as the Beaver Wars.

The late-17th and 18th centuries saw four major British-French conflicts fought in Canada. The British conquest of New France in 1760 reshaped the region and contributed to the American Revolutionary War. American attempts to seize Quebec and incite revolt in Nova Scotia during the Revolution failed as French Canadians and Indigenous nations remained neutral or supported the British, and incoming Loyalist refugees bolstered British control.

The 19th century brought both external threats and internal challenges to British North America. While its colonies repelled American invasions during the War of 1812, the Rebellions of 1837–1838 and Fenian raids highlighted the need for militia reforms and contributed to Canadian Confederation in 1867. The end of the century saw Canadian units become involved in British imperial conflicts like the Nile Expedition and Second Boer War.

In the 20th century, Canada played a significant role in both World Wars. After World War II, it embraced multilateralism, with its military participating in international coalitions and peacekeeping missions, including the Korean War and the Gulf War. In the 21st century, Canada has continued its involvement in multilateral military coalitions, contributing to missions in the Greater Middle East and Mali.

== Warfare pre-contact==
Warfare existed in all regions and waxed in intensity, frequency and decisiveness. It was even common in subarctic areas that had sufficient population density. However, Inuit groups in the extreme northern Arctic typically avoided direct warfare due to their small populations, relying on traditional law to resolve conflicts. Conflict was waged for economic and political reasons, such as asserting their tribal independence, securing resources and territory, exacting tribute, and controlling trade routes. Additionally, conflicts arose for personal and tribal honour, seeking revenge for perceived wrongs. 

In pre-contact Canada, Indigenous warriors relied primarily on the bow and arrow, having honed their archery skills through their hunting practices. Knives, hatchets/tomahawks and warclubs were used for hand-to-hand combat. Some conflicts took place over great distances, with a few military expeditions travelling as far as .

Warfare tended to be formal and ritualistic, resulting in few casualties. However, some violent conflicts occurred, including the complete genocide of some First Nations groups by others, such as the displacement of the Dorset of Newfoundland by the Beothuk. The St. Lawrence Valley Iroquois were also almost completely displaced, likely due to warfare with their neighbours the Algonquin. The threat of conflict impacted how some groups lived, with Algonquian and Iroquois groups residing in fortified villages with layers of defences and wooden palisades at least by 1000 CE.

Captives from battles were not always killed. Tribes frequently adopted them to replenish lost warriors or used them for prisoner exchanges. Slavery was common among the Pacific Northwest Coast&#x27;s Indigenous people like the Tlingit and Haida, with around a quarter of the region&#x27;s population being enslaved. In certain societies, slavery was hereditary, with slaves and their descendants being prisoners of war.

Several First Nations also formed alliances with one another, like the Iroquois League. These existing military alliances became important to the colonial powers in the struggle for North American hegemony during the 17th and 18th centuries.

===European contact===

The first clash between Europeans and Indigenous peoples likely transpired around 1003, during Norse attempts to settle North America&#x27;s northeastern coast, such as at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows. Although relations were initially peaceful, conflict arose between the Norse and local First Nations, or &quot;Skrælings&quot;, possibly due to the Norse&#x27;s refusal to sell weapons. Indigenous bows and clubs proved effective against Norse weaponry, and their canoes offered greater manoeuvrability in an environment they were familiar with. Outnumbered, the Norse abandoned the settlement.

The first European-Indigenous engagements to occur in Canada during the Age of Discovery took place during Jacques Cartier&#x27;s third expedition to the Americas from 1541 to 1542. Between 1577 and 1578, the Inuit clashed with English explorers under Martin Frobisher near Baffin Island.

== 17th century ==
Firearms began to make their way into Indigenous hands by the early 17th century, with significant acquisition starting in the 1640s. The arrival of firearms made fighting between Indigenous groups bloodier and more decisive, especially as tribes got embroiled in the economic and military rivalries of European settlers. Unequal access to firearms and horses significantly amplified bloodshed in Indigenous conflicts. By the end of the 17th century, Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands and the eastern subarctic rapidly transitioned to firearms, supplanting the bow. Though firearms predominated, the bow and arrow saw limited use into the early 18th century as a covert weapon for surprise attacks. 

Early European colonies in Canada include the French settlement of Port-Royal in 1605 and the English settlement of Cuper&#x27;s Cove five years later. French claims stretched to the Mississippi River valley, where fur trappers and colonists established scattered settlements. The French built a series of forts to defend these settlements, although some were also used as trading posts. New France&#x27;s two main colonies, Acadia on the Bay of Fundy and Canada on the St. Lawrence River, relied mainly on the fur trade. These colonies grew slowly due to difficult geographical and climatic circumstances. By 1706, its population was around 16,000. By the mid-1700s, New France had about one-tenth of the population of the British Thirteen Colonies to the south. In addition to the Thirteen Colonies, the English chartered seasonal fishing settlements in Newfoundland Colony and claimed Hudson Bay and its drainage basin, known as Rupert&#x27;s Land, through the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC).

The early military of New France was made up of regulars from the French Royal Army and Navy, supported by the colonial militia. Initially composed of soldiers from France, New France&#x27;s military evolved to include volunteers raised within the colony by 1690. Many French soldiers stationed in New France also chose to stay after their service, fostering a tradition of generational service and the creation of a military elite. By the 1750s, most New French military officers were born in the colony. New France&#x27;s military also relied on Indigenous allies for support to mitigate the manpower advantage of the Thirteen Colonies. This relationship significantly impacted New French military practices, like the adoption of Indigenous guerrilla tactics by its military professionals.

===Beaver Wars===
The Beaver Wars (1609–1701) were intermittent conflicts involving the Iroquois Confederacy, New France, and France&#x27;s Indigenous allies. By the 17th century, several First Nations&#x27; economies relied heavily on the regional fur trade with Europeans. The French quickly joined pre-existing Indigenous alliances such as the Huron-Algonquin alliance, bringing them into conflict with the Iroquois Confederacy, who initially aligned with Dutch colonists and later with the English. As a result, the primary threat against New France in its early years were the Iroquois, particularly the easternmost Mohawks.

Conflict between the French and Iroquois likely arose from the latter&#x27;s ambition to control the beaver pelt trade. However, some scholars posit Iroquoian hegemonic ambitions as a factor, while others suggest these were &quot;mourning wars&quot; to replenish populations in the wake of the epidemic that afflicted Indigenous peoples. Regardless, Iroquois hostilities against First Nations of the St. Lawrence Valley and Great Lakes disrupted the fur trade and drew the French into the wider conflict.

====1609–1667====

Initially, the French offered limited support to their Indigenous allies, providing iron arrowheads and knives, but few firearms. Although France&#x27;s Indigenous allies saw some success, the Iroquois gained the initiative after adopting tactics that integrated Indigenous hunting skills and terrain knowledge with firearms acquired from the Dutch. Access to firearms proved decisive, enabling the Iroquois to wage an effective guerrilla war.

After depleting the beaver population within their lands, the Iroquois launched several expansionist campaigns, raiding the Algonquin in the Ottawa Valley and attacking the French in the 1630s and 1640s. These attacks caused the dispersion of the Neutral, Petun, and Huron Confederacy, along with the systematic destruction of Huronia. The string of Iroquois victories isolated the French from their Algonquin allies and left its settlements defenceless. Exploiting this, the Iroquois negotiated a favourable peace, requiring French Jesuits and soldiers to relocate to Iroquois villages so they could aid in their defence.

Hostilities resumed between the two sides in 1658 when the French withdrew their Iroquois missions. After years of expansionist campaigns in the mid-1650s, the outbreak of a wider front in 1659 and 1660 strained the Confederacy. 
To secure a favourable peace, the French sent the Carignan-Salières Regiment in 1665, the first uniformed professional soldiers station in Canada, and whose members formed the core of the Compagnies Franches de la Marine militia. The regiment&#x27;s arrival led the Iroquois to agree to peace in 1667.

====1668–1701====

After the 1667 peace, the French formed alliances with First Nations further west, most of whom conflicted with the Iroquois. The French provided them with firearms and encouraged them to attack the Iroquois. They also solidified ties with the Abenaki in Acadia, who were harassed by the Iroquois. Conflict resumed in the 1680s when the Iroquois targeted French coureurs de bois and the Illinois Confederation, a French ally. French-allied expeditions were launched in 1684 and 1687, though only the latter saw some success.

In 1689, the Iroquois launched new attacks, including the Lachine massacre, to support their English allies during the Nine Years&#x27; War and in retaliation for the 1687 expedition. However, after a flurry of raids by France&#x27;s western allies and a Franco-Indigenous expedition led by Governor General Louis de Buade de Frontenac in 1696, the weakened Iroquois opted to negotiate peace. The Great Peace of Montreal was signed in 1701 between the Iroquois, France, and 38 other First Nations. The terms saw the Iroquois agree to remain neutral in Anglo-French conflicts in return for trade benefits. This weakened the English-Iroquois trading relationship and Covenant Chain. Although the Iroquois nations expanded their territories during the conflict, they did not achieve the prosperity initially envisioned.

===Early British-French colonial hostilities===

English-French hostilities over colonial interests first escalated in 1613 when Samuel Argall and his sailors razed the French settlement of Port-Royal with little resistance to secure the Bay of Fundy fisheries for the English colony of Virginia.

In the Anglo-French War of 1627 to 1629, the English authorized David Kirke to settle Canada and conduct raids against the French there. In 1628, Kirke&#x27;s forces seized a French supply fleet and Tadoussac, and captured Quebec City the next year. Scottish settlers founded settlements in seized French territories like Port-Royal and Baleine. However, French forces destroyed Baleine just two months after its founding in 1629. In 1630, an Anglo-Scottish attack against Fort St. Louis, one of France&#x27;s last remaining Acadian strongholds, was repulsed. French settlements that were seized during the war were returned in the 1632 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

==== Acadian Civil War and its subsequent seizure ====

Acadia fell into civil war in the mid-17th century. After Lieutenant Governor Isaac de Razilly died in 1635, Acadia was split administratively. Charles de Menou d&#x27;Aulnay ruled from Port-Royal and Charles de Saint-Étienne de la Tour governed from Saint John. Unclear boundaries overs administrative authority led to conflict between the two governors.

In 1640, La Tour forces attacked Port-Royal. In response, d&#x27;Aulnay imposed a five-month blockade on Saint John. La Tour&#x27;s forces overcame the blockade and retaliated with an attack on Port-Royal in 1643. In April 1645, d&#x27;Aulney besieged and captured Saint John, after hearing of La Tour&#x27;s departure to meet his supporters in New England. d&#x27;Aulney governed all of Acadia from 1645 until he died in 1650, having gained favour with the French government by informing them of La Tour&#x27;s attempt to seek aid from the English in New England.

After d&#x27;Aulney&#x27;s death, La Tour returned to France and regained his reputation and governorship over Acadia. La Tour&#x27;s governorship ended in 1654 when English forces under Robert Sedgwick seized the territory exhausted by years of civil war and neglect by the French court. Sedgwick was authorized to seize Acadia to secure its fur and fishing resources for New England and the Protectorate, as retaliation for French privateer attacks on English ships.

=== Anglo-Dutch Wars ===
The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–1667) resulted from tensions between England and the Dutch Republic, driven partly by competition over maritime dominance and trade routes. In 1664, Michiel de Ruyter was instructed to retaliate against the English seizures of Dutch East India Company assets in West Africa by attacking English ships. In 1665, his fleet raided English settlements and shipping, including St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. The treaty that ended the conflict saw the English return Acadia to the French, a region they had seized in 1654.

In 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672–1674), a Dutch fleet raided English colonies in North America, including fishing fleets and shore facilities at Ferryland, Newfoundland.

=== Nine Years&#x27; War ===

During the Nine Years&#x27; War (1688–1697), English and French forces clashed in North America in a conflict known as King William&#x27;s War. Governor General Frontenac initially devised an invasion to conquer the Province of New York to isolate the Iroquois, although the plan&#x27;s scale was later reduced. In February 1690, three New French-First Nations military expeditions were launched against New England. One attacked Schenectady, another raided Salmon Falls, while a third besieged Fort Loyal. New France also urged other First Nations allies to conduct raids along the English American frontier and promoted scalpings for psychological warfare. 

After several attacks from New France&#x27;s &quot;petite guerre&quot;, the English launched two retaliatory expeditions. A naval expedition sailed in 1690 to capture Quebec City but arrived just before the St. Lawrence River froze in mid-October, leaving little time to achieve its objective due to poor organization. After a failed landing at Beauport, English forces withdrew. Another English expedition was repulsed at the Battle of La Prairie in 1691. The English also attacked Acadian settlements, including Port Royal, Chedabucto, Chignecto, and Fort Nashwaak.

In 1696, Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville was tasked with attacking English fishing stations and expel the English from Newfoundland. Setting sail from Plaisance, the French administrative capital for the island, d&#x27;Iberville&#x27;s squadron razed St John&#x27;s in November 1696, destroyed English fisheries along Newfoundland&#x27;s eastern shore, as smaller raiding parties looted remote English hamlets, seizing prisoners. After four months, Iberville destroyed 36 settlements, leaving only Bonavista and Carbonear under English control by the end of March 1697.

During the war, the French strengthened their control over Hudson Bay, having already seized several HBC forts in an expedition two years before the war. French attempts to capture York Factory, HBC&#x27;s only remaining fort around Hudson&#x27;s Bay, included a failed effort in 1690 and its brief capture in 1694, although the English later recaptured the fort. The French finally secured York Factory after the Battle of Hudson&#x27;s Bay in 1697.

The 1697 Peace of Ryswick ended the war, and required the return of territorial gains in North America. The HBC was also forced to surrender all but one fort on Hudson Bay. After the peace, the English and French reinforced their alliances and trade relations with Indigenous groups. It also paved the way for the end of the Beaver Wars in 1701.

====English-maritime Algonquians conflict====
The Nine Years&#x27; War intersected with an ongoing conflict between the English and maritime Algonquians, who had been attacking English settlements in retaliation against their territorial encroachment shortly before the English-French conflict started.

French missionaries and settlers living in maritime Algonquian villages inflamed their hostilities with England to France&#x27;s benefit. The French sabotaged English-maritime Algonquians peace talks in 1693, encouraging their ally to continue fighting. The French also encouraged the Abenaki and Mi&#x27;kmaq to engage in privateering or buccaneering with the French Navy, taking part in the naval battle off St. John and the second siege of Pemaquid in 1696.

== 18th century ==
During the 18th century, the British–French struggle in Canada intensified as the rivalry worsened in Europe. The French government increased its military spending in its North American colonies, maintaining expansive garrisons at remote fur trading posts, improving the fortifications in Quebec City, and constructing a new fortified town on Île Royale, Louisbourg, dubbed the &quot;Gibraltar of the North&quot; or the &quot;Dunkirk of America.&quot;

New France and the New England Colonies engaged in three wars during the 18th century. The first two of these conflicts, Queen Anne&#x27;s War and King George&#x27;s War, stemmed from broader European conflicts—the War of the Spanish Succession and the War of the Austrian Succession. The final conflict, the French and Indian War, began in the Ohio Valley, and evolved into the Seven Years&#x27; War. During this period, the Canadien &quot;petite guerre&quot; tactics ravaged northern towns and villages of New England and travelled as far south as Virginia and the Hudson Bay shore.

=== War of Spanish Succession ===

During the War of Spanish Succession, English and French forces clashed in North America in a conflict known as Queen Anne&#x27;s War (1702–1713). The conflict primarily focused on Acadia and New England, as Canada and New York informally agreed to remain neutral. Initially neutral, the French-aligned Abenaki were drawn into the conflict due to English hostilities. 

Raids between Acadians and New Englanders took place throughout the war, including the raid on Grand Pré in 1704 and the Battle of Bloody Creek in 1711. The raid on Grand Pré, launched by New England forces, was in retaliation for a French-First Nations raid on Deerfield in the British Province of Massachusetts Bay. Similar raids in Massachusetts included the raid on Haverhill. The French besieging St. John&#x27;s in 1705 and captured the city after a battle in 1709. 

The French suffered a major setback when the British captured the Acadian capital of Port-Royal after three-sieges. Although the French repelled two sieges in 1707, the British succeeded after a third siege in 1710. Building on this success, the British launched the Quebec Expedition to capture the capital of New France. However, the expedition was abandoned when its fleet was wrecked by the waters of the St. Lawrence River.

The ensuing Peace of Utrecht saw the French surrender substantial North American territory. This included returning Hudson Bay lands to the HBC and relinquishing claims to Newfoundland and Acadia, though retaining fishing rights in parts of Newfoundland. However, due to a dispute over the size of Acadia, the French maintained control over its western portion (present-day New Brunswick). The French also continued its relationship with the Abenaki and Mi&#x27;kmaq in Acadia and encouraged them to attack the British. After the conflict, the French built the Fortress of Louisbourg to protect its remaining Acadian settlements on Île-Royale and Île Saint-Jean, while the British quickly built new outposts to secure its Acadian holdings.

===Father Rale&#x27;s War===

Although British-French hostilities ended in 1713, conflict persisted between the maritime Algonquians and the British, with the Mi’kmaq seizing 40 British ships from 1715 to 1722. In May 1722 Lieutenant Governor John Doucett took 22 Mi&#x27;kmaq hostages to Annapolis Royal to prevent the capital from being attacked. In July, the Abenaki and Mi&#x27;kmaq initiated a blockade of Annapolis Royal, aiming to starve the capital. Due to increasing tensions, Massachusetts Governor Samuel Shute declared war on the Abenaki on July 22. Early engagements during the war took place in the Nova Scotia. In July 1724, 60 Mi&#x27;kmaq and Maliseets raided Annapolis Royal.

The treaty that ended the war marked a major change in European relations with the maritime Algonquians, as it granted the British the right to settle in traditional Abenaki and Mi&#x27;kmaq lands. The treaty was also the first formal recognition by a European power that its control over Nova Scotia was dependent on negotiation with its Indigenous inhabitants. The treaty was invoked as recently as 1999 in the Donald Marshall case.

===Fox Wars===

The Fox Wars, was an intermittent conflict from 1712 to the 1730s between New France and its Indigenous allies against the Meskwaki. The conflict highlighted how the New French military, supported by its allies, was able to inflict significant losses against enemies thousands of kilometres away from its Canadian core.

In response to Meskwaki raids on coureurs de bois and indigenous allies, particularly the Illinois, New French troops were deployed westward in 1716 to confront the Meskwaki. Despite initial success in forcing them to seek peace, the attacks continued. With diplomatic efforts failing in the 1720s, New France resolved to exterminate the Meskwaki. Subsequent campaigns, including an Illinois-led siege in 1730, led to the death or enslavement of many Meskwaki. A final punitive expedition by New France to present-day Iowa in 1735 failed due to lack of support from Indigenous allies, who deemed the Meskwaki adequately punished.

=== War of Austrian Succession ===
British and French forces clashed in the War of Austrian Succession, with the North American theatre known as King George&#x27;s War (1744–1748). While maritime Algonquians swiftly allied with the French, many Indigenous groups in the Great Lakes region hesitated to join, preferring to maintain trade ties with the British. These ties were deliberately fostered by the British prior to the war to weaken France&#x27;s Indigenous alliances.

Throughout the war, Acadians and Canadiens raided frontier British settlements, with Canso, Annapolis Royal, and Grand Pré among the Nova Scotian settlements attacked. French-Mohawk forces also attacked New England and New York, raiding Saratoga and besieging Fort Massachusetts. However, the Mohawk were unwilling to join French excursions deeper into New York to avoid conflicts with other members of the Iroquois Confederacy.

In 1745, a British-New England force besieiged and captured Louisbourg. The capture of Louisbourg significantly weakened Franco-Indigenous alliances around the Great Lakes as it isolated Quebec City from France and interrupted trade. As a result, the price of goods skyrocketed and the French could not provide annual gifts to secure its alliances. This caused some Indigenous nations to end their support for the French war effort, viewing the absence of gifts as a breach of alliance terms. The largest military expedition to sail from Europe for the Americas was launched by the French in 1746, aiming to recapture Louisbourg. However, the expedition was unsuccessful due to adverse weather and illness affecting its troops.

Although Louisbourg was captured, the British failed to advance further into New France after its forces were defeated at Port-la-Joye in 1746. The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the war and saw Louisbourg returned to France in exchange for territories in the Low Countries and India. The forfieture of Louisbourg outraged New Englanders. To combat France&#x27;s continued presence in Acadia, the British established the military settlement of Halifax and Citadel Hill in 1749.

=== Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War ===
Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War (1749–1755) took place in Acadia and Nova Scotia, with the Mi&#x27;kmaq and Acadians, under the leadership of French priest Jean-Louis Le Loutre, opposing British and New England settlers, led by figures like John Gorham and Charles Lawrence. The Mi&#x27;kmaq and Acadians attacked British forts and newly-established Protestant settlements to hinder British expansion and support France&#x27;s Acadian resettlement efforts.

After Halifax was established by the British, the Acadians and Mi&#x27;kmaq attacked Chignecto, Grand-Pré, Dartmouth, Canso, Halifax and Country Harbour. The French erected forts at present-day Saint John, Chignecto and Fort Gaspareaux. The British responded by attacking the Mi&#x27;kmaq and Acadians at Mirligueche, Chignecto and St. Croix, and building forts in Acadian communities at Windsor, Grand-Pré, and Chignecto. The conflict ended with the British victory at the Battle of Fort Beauséjour and Le Loutre&#x27;s subsequent capture.

Acadia and Nova Scotia experienced unprecedented fortification building and troop deployments. The region also experienced unprecedented population movement, with Acadians and Mi&#x27;kmaq leaving Nova Scotia in an exodus to the neighbouring French colonies of Île Saint-Jean and Île Royale.

=== Seven Years&#x27; War ===
New French-British colonial hostilities culminated in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Although formal hostilities between France and Britain began in 1756, fighting erupted in North America in 1754 in what became known as the French and Indian War (1754–1760). Disputes over the Ohio Country prompted the French to construct a series forts in 1753, sparking hostilities with neighbouring British colonies in 1754. Most First Nations supported the French, largely due to their opposition to earlier British territorial policies. The British worked to undermine the Franco-Indigenous alliances by seeking the latter&#x27;s neutrality through Iroquois intermediaries. The Iroquois Confederacy eventually entered the conflict as a British ally at the Battle of Fort Niagara in 1759.

====Early French success and Acadia====
In 1754, the British planned a four-pronged attack against New France, with attacks planned against Fort Niagara on the Niagara River, Fort Saint-Frédéric on Lake Champlain, Fort Duquesne on the Ohio River, and Fort Beauséjour at the border of French-held Acadia. The plan fell apart as forces sent to capture Niagara and Saint-Frédéric abandoned their campaigns, and the Braddock Expedition sent to capture Duquesne was defeated at Monongahela by a New French-First Nations force. Although most of the plan had failed, the army sent to Acadia was successful at the Battle of Fort Beauséjour. After Beauséjour, the British worked to consolidate control over Acadia, neutralizing the Acadians military potency and disrupting supply lines to Louisbourg, starting with the Bay of Fundy campaign in 1755. These campaigns resulted in the forced relocation of over 12,000 Acadians from Acadia during the war.

In 1756, following the formal declaration of war between the British and French, the commander-in-chief of New France, Pierre de Rigaud, marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial, devised a strategy to keep the British on the defensive and away from the populated areas of New France, like Canada. This resulted in French offensives like the Battle of Fort Oswego and Siege of Fort William Henry, and raids on British frontier settlements by the Canadian militia and First Nations allies. A small French army, supported by the militia and First Nations allies, effectively pinned down British forces at its frontier, prompting the dispatch of 20,000 additional soldiers to reinforce British America. Despite early success in tying down British forces, the French were hindered by limited resources, as most of France&#x27;s army was engaged the Europe, unable to reinforce its colony.

====British conquest of New France====

In July 1758, the British renewed its offensive against New France, although its initial invasion force of 15,000 soldiers were defeated by a force of 3,800 soldiers near Fort Carillon. However, in the following weeks, the French faced significant setbacks. The British captured Louisbourg after a month-long siege in June–July 1758 and destroyed the French supply stock at Fort Frontenac in August 1758. During that time, the French were compelled to retreat from Fort Duquesne when some of their First Nations allies made a separate peace agreement with the British.

Following these victories, the British launched three campaigns against Canada: the first two targeted Niagara and Lake Champlain, while the third targeted Quebec City. After the French repelled the latter invasion force at the Battle of Beauport, British commander Major-General James Wolfe opted to besiege Quebec City. The three-month siege culminated in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in September 1759, where French general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm led a numerically inferior force out of the walled city to face the British. The French were defeated, with both Wolfe and Montcalm killed in battle. 

In April 1760, the French launched a campaign to retake Quebec City, defeating the British at the Battle of Sainte-Foy. After the battle, the British withdrew into the walls of Quebec City&#x27;s. The French besieged the city until May, when a British naval force defeated a French naval unit supporting the siege at the Battle of Pointe-aux-Trembles. The arrival of the British Royal Navy left New France virtually isolated from France. As a result, the remaining French Army retreated to Montreal and signed the Articles of Capitulation of Montreal on 8 September, marking the completion of the British conquest of New France. A week later, the British made peace with the Seven Nations of Canada, followed by France&#x27;s maritime Algonquian allies in 1761.

British naval supremacy was pivotal in the war&#x27;s outcome, facilitating the capture of Louisbourg and Quebec City and blocking French reinforcements to the colony. This led to significant territorial concessions by France in the Treaty of Paris of 1763, including New France. However, the war burdened Britain with a massive financial debt. The absence of the French military threat also emboldened residents of the Thirteen Colonies, who no longer needed to rely on the British for military protection against the French.

===Pontiac&#x27;s War===

After the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1763, rumours circulated of a First Nations offensive on the British frontier. An alliance of First Nations led by Odawa chief Pontiac aimed to expel the British from the Great Lakes and Ohio Country. The alliance was forced to lay siege to Fort Detroit after learning the British were aware of their activities. The siege prompted other First Nations aligned with Odawa to attack British outposts in the region. In the conflict, a 300-strong battalion of French Canadians, led by former &quot;Troupes de la Marines&quot;, was raised and sent to Fort Detroit as part of Brigadier-General John Bradstreet&#x27;s expedition. Despite its early success, the resistance waned when Pontiac failed to capture Fort Detroit.

Peace was eventually achieved through the distribution of traditional presents and the issuance of the Royal Proclamation of 1763. This proclamation established the Province of Quebec and the Indian Reserve, while also granting First Nations various land rights. These measures were implemented to protect the First Nations while facilitating the peaceful, &quot;gradual settlement&quot; of the frontier. However, it inadvertently made Britain into an obstacle against the territorial expansion of the Thirteen Colonies, a role previously held by France.

=== American Revolutionary War ===

After the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Thirteen Colonies became restive over taxes imposed by the British Parliament, with many questioning its necessity when they no longer needed to pay for a large military force to counter the French. American frustrations intensified following the passage of the Quebec Act, which restored Catholic rights in Quebec, much to the ire of the anti-Catholic Protestant-based Thirteen Colonies. The act also expanded Quebec&#x27;s territory to include portions of the Indian Reserve, such as the Ohio Country, long desired by British colonies like Pennsylvania and Virginia. These tensions led to a political revolution in the Thirteen Colonies, and eventually, the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), with American rebels aiming to break free from the British parliament, and assert their claim on the Ohio Country.

====Quebec and Nova Scotia====

At the war&#x27;s start, most people in Quebec and the Maritime colonies remained neutral, hesitant to join either the Americans or the British side. Early in the war, revolutionaries launched a propaganda campaign in the Canadian colonies, although it only attracted limited support. British attempts to raise a militia in Quebec also saw limited success, although they were able to rely on the French Canadian clergy, landowners, and other leading citizens for support. The British received support from the Seven Nations of Canada and the Iroquois Confederacy, though the latter attempted to remain neutral due to an internal civil conflict in the confederacy. 

In September 1775, American forces invaded Quebec, beginning with the capture of Fort Ticonderoga and the siege of Fort St. Jean near Montreal. The siege prompted Governor Guy Carleton to abandon Montreal for Quebec City. The Continental Army advanced towards Quebec City, where they were joined by Benedict Arnold&#x27;s expedition. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, they attacked the city but were repelled. After the failed assault, the Americans besieged Quebec until spring 1776, when the Americans were routed by a British naval force sent to relieve Quebec. The Americans subsequently abandoned Montreal, and their remaining forces were defeated at the Battle of Trois-Rivières in June 1776. British forces, led by General John Burgoyne, pursued the retreating Americans out of Quebec into New York in a counter-invasion. 

Although the &quot;Canadien&quot; militia formed most of Quebec City&#x27;s defenders during the invasion, they saw limited action beyond Quebec. British reluctance to deploy them elsewhere stemmed from uncertainty about their loyalty when faced with the French Army. Five British provincial corps, augmented by additional unincorporated units and Loyalist associators, were raised in the Canadian colonies to assist in its defence and to harass the American frontier. British First Nations allies, led by Thayendanegea, also conducted raids against US border settlements from 1778 to war&#x27;s end.

New Englanders attempted to incite a revolt in Nova Scotia but were defeated at the battles of Fort Cumberland in 1776 and St. John in 1777. Although they failed to incite a revolt, Nova Scotia remained a target of American privateering throughout the war, with most coastal outposts being attacked. Attacks like the 1782 raid on Lunenburg had a devastating effect on the colony&#x27;s maritime economy. American privateers seized 225 vessels departing from or arriving at Nova Scotian ports in total. The French Navy also attacked a British naval convoy off Nova Scotia in July 1781. Conversely, the British captured many American privateers off Nova Scotia&#x27;s coast, such as in the 1782 battle off Halifax. They also used the colony as a staging ground to launch attacks against New England, as seen in the Battle of Machias.
====Consequences====
The revolutionaries&#x27; failure to seize the Canadian colonies and the continued loyalty of British colonists led to the fragmentation of Britain&#x27;s North American empire. Despite successfully defending Quebec and Nova Scotia, British military defeats in the Thirteen Colonies led to their surrender in 1781 and the subsequent recognition of the independent US republic in the Treaty of Paris of 1783.

Suspicions against the US persisted in the Canadian colonies for decades. Over 75,000 Loyalists, comprising 15 per cent of residents in the Thirteen Colonies who supported the Crown, migrated north to the remaining parts of British North America. The British also ceded Indian Reserve south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States. As the area included the traditional Iroquois territory, the British offered land in Quebec to the Iroquois, hoping to establish new Iroquois communities that would serve as a barrier against the Americans.

===French Revolutionary Wars===

In 1796, during the War of the First Coalition, a naval expedition under Joseph de Richery planned to attack Newfoundland. However, de Richery opted to not attack the island&#x27;s capital after his forces failed to unite with another naval squadron from Brest and the British mobilized its defences in St. John&#x27;s. Although St. John&#x27;s was not attacked, de Richery&#x27;s squadron disrupted the island&#x27;s fisheries and razed Bay Bulls and Petty Harbour.

== 19th century ==
A form of compulsory military service was established in the Canadas during the 19th century, instituted in Lower Canada in 1803 and Upper Canada in 1808. The compulsory sedentary militia comprised male inhabitants aged 16 to 60 and was mobilized solely during emergencies. In peacetime, service involved a one to two-day annual muster parade.

The role of the militia during the American Revolution and War of 1812 led to the &quot;citizen soldier&quot; becoming a unique symbol of adulation in 19th-century Canadian military culture. This veneration stands in contrast with the United States and other British settler colonies, and led to the &quot;militia myth&quot; in the 19th-century Canadian zeitgeist, a belief that it did not need a standing army for its defence, as it could rely on its inhabitants to mobilize into militias overnight. This belief created a tendency to ignore the need for rigorous militia training during peacetime.

=== War of 1812 ===
Animosity and suspicion persisted between the UK and the US decades after the American Revolution. 
The Napoleonic Wars exacerbated Anglo-American tensions, as the UK&#x27;s naval blockade of France and the impressment of American sailors the British claimed were deserters, aggravated the US. As the US lacked a navy capable of challenging the UK, an invasion of Canada was proposed as a feasible method to attack the British. Americans living in the western frontier also hoped an invasion would end British support for Indigenous resistances in the American Northwest Territory. Strong support for war from congressional war hawks and optimistic assessments over the feasibility of invading Canada from US officers, like Major General Henry Dearborn, led the US to declare war on the UK in June 1812.

US strategy focused on a vulnerable Upper Canada, as the Maritime colonies were well-defended and Lower Canada deemed too remote and its capital too well-fortified. At the start of the war, Upper Canada had minimal defences, consisting of only 1,600 regular troops, Britain&#x27;s Indigenous allies, and several Canadian units raised for the war, including the Provincial Marine, Fencibles, and militia units like Captain Runchey&#x27;s Company of Coloured Men. 

Believing a bold attack was needed to galvanize the local population and First Nations to the colony&#x27;s defence, Major-General Isaac Brock quickly ordered a British-First Nations siege on Fort Mackinac. In August 1812, Brock&#x27;s force moved towards Amherstburg to confront an invading American army in Upper Canada, only to find that they had retreated to Detroit. The American retreat facilitated Brock&#x27;s alliance with Shawnee chief Tecumseh and provided him with the excuse to abandon his orders to maintain a defensive posture within Upper Canada. A British-First Nations force besieged and captured Detroit, providing them control over the Michigan Territory and the Upper Mississippi.

In October 1812, a British-First Nations force thwarted an American crossing of the Niagara River at the Battle of Queenston Heights. However, the battle resulted in the death of Brock. An American army sent to retake Detroit was defeated in January 1813, ending the threat of an American offensive into Canada that winter. Despite the success of Brock&#x27;s offensives, his death prompted the British to adopt a defensive stance. Governor General George Prevost prioritized conserving his forces, concentrating the strongest garrisons in Lower Canada. Conversely, Upper Canada was only reinforced when additional troops arrived from overseas.

====1813====

In April 1813, an American naval squadron defeated the British at the Battle of York, briefly occupying and burning parts of the Upper Canadian capital. They then captured Fort George on May 27. However, the retreating British regrouped and defeated American forces at the battles of Stoney Creek and Beaver Dams. The Americans retreated across the Niagara River in December after setting Fort George and Niagara ablaze. In retaliation, the British razed parts of Buffalo during the Battle of Buffalo and continued similar reprisals into 1814, most notably in Washington. 

Although the British successfully defended the Niagara Peninsula in 1813, they faced significant setbacks in the western frontier. The British-First Nations force failed to capture Fort Meigs, and the British lost control of the Upper Great Lakes after the Battle of Lake Erie. After the naval defeat, British-First Nations forces in the American Northwest Territory were forced to retreat, but were pursued and ultimately routed at the Battle of Moraviantown. Tecumseh&#x27;s death at the battle fractured his confederacy and the alliance with the British.

In late 1813, there were two American invasion attempts in Lower Canada. One was repelled by a British-First Nations force at the Battle of the Chateauguay in October, while the other was turned back by a British force at the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm in November.

====1814====
The final incursions into the Canadas took place in 1814. US forces crossed the Niagara River in July and captured Fort Erie. The American advance led to the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane. While the battle ended in a stalemate, the exhausted Americans were compelled to retreat to Fort Erie. The Americans successfully defended Fort Erie against a British siege, but the Americans withdrew to the US shortly after.

In 1814, the British regained the initiative, securing control of Lake Huron after several engagements and establishing effective control over Lake Ontario with , a first-rate warship that deterred American naval actions from its launch in September to war&#x27;s end. In the Atlantic, British naval efforts were supported by Nova Scotian privateer ships raiding US shipping. The most notable Nova Scotian privateer ship, the &quot;Liverpool Packet&quot;, captured 50 ships by war&#x27;s end.

The end of the War of the Sixth Coalition led the British to shift their focus to their war with the US, with Lower Canada and Nova Scotia served as staging areas for the British. The British force gathered in Lower Canada invaded northern New York but was repelled at the Battle of Plattsburgh in September. The force gathered in Halifax had greater success, capturing most of Maine&#x27;s coastline by mid-September.

The Treaty of Ghent, signed on 24 December 1814, ended the conflict and restored the territorial status quo. However, fighting persisted into 1815 in areas unaware of the peace. The war fostered a sense of community in Canadian colonies and set the stage for Canada&#x27;s future nationhood. No side of the war can claim total victory, as neither fully achieved their war aims. However, historians commonly regard the First Nations as the &quot;losers&quot; of the conflict, given the collapse of the Tecumseh&#x27;s confederacy in 1813 and the British dropping their proposal for a First Nations buffer state in the midwestern US during peace negotiations.

===Pemmican War===
In 1812, the Red River Colony was established by the HBC despite protest from the North West Company (NWC), who already operated the nearby trading post, Fort Gibraltar. In January 1814, the colony issued the Pemmican Proclamation, banning the export of pemmican and other provisions for a year to secure its growth. The NWC and local Métis voyageurs that traded with the NWC opposed the ban, viewing it as a move by the HBC to control NWC traders&#x27; food supply.

In June 1815, Métis leader and NWC clerk Cuthbert Grant led a group to harass and steal supplies from the Red River settlement. In response, the HBC seized Fort Gibraltar in March 1816 to curb local pemmican trade. This led to the brief Battle of Seven Oaks in June 1816 when HBC officials confronted Métis and First Nations voyageurs. After the confrontation, Grant briefly controlled the area, prompting the HBC and Red River settlers to retreat to Norway House. HBC authority was restored in August when Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk, arrived with 90 soldiers.

===British forces in Canada in the mid–19th century===

Fear of an American invasion of the Canadas persisted for at least the next half-century, prompting the retention of a sizable British garrison in the colony. From the 1820s to the 1840s, the British built up several fortifications to serve as strong defensive points against potential invasions, including the citadel and ramparts in Quebec City, Fort Henry in Kingston, and the Imperial fortress of Halifax. The Rideau Canal was built to provide a northern waterway from Montreal to Kingston during wartime, bypassing the St. Lawrence River, a waterway that was also the Canada–US border.

By the 1850s, fears of an American invasion had waned, prompting the British to downsize their garrison. The Canadian-American Reciprocity Treaty of 1854 further alleviated concerns.

====Local levies and recruitment====

The British Army levied and recruited from the local population to form new units or to replace individuals lost to enemy action, sickness, or desertion. Examples of this practice include the War of 1812, the Rebellions of 1837–1838, the Fenian Raids, and the Wolseley expedition. British Army units raised in Canadian colonies during this period include the 40th Regiment of Foot, the 100th (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Royal Canadian) Regiment of Foot, and the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment.

Several Canadians served in the British military during the Crimean War, with the Welsford-Parker Monument in Halifax the sole Crimean War monument in North America. Alexander Roberts Dunn, the first Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, earned the medal for his actions during the Charge of the Light Brigade. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, William Nelson Hall became the first Black Nova Scotian to receive the medal, having been awarded it for his actions at the Siege of Lucknow.

=== Rebellions of 1837–1838 ===
Two armed uprisings broke out from 1837 to 1838 in the Canadas. Calls for responsible government and an economic depression in Lower Canada led to protests and, subsequently, an armed insurrection led by the radical Patriote movement. The uprising, which erupted in November 1837, was the more significant and violent insurgency between the two rebellions. The other armed uprising occurred in Upper Canada shortly thereafter, its leaders inspired by the events in Lower Canada.

The inaugural uprising in Lower Canada began in November 1837. British regulars and Canadian militia fought Patriote rebels in a series of skirmishes, including the battles of Saint-Denis, Saint-Charles, and Saint-Eustache. The disorganized rebels were defeated, with their leadership escaping to the US. Following this, anglophone militias pillaged and burned French Canadian settlements. A second uprising in Lower Canada commenced in November 1838 with aid from American volunteers, but it was poorly organized and quickly put down. The Lower Canada Rebellion resulted in 325 deaths, predominantly among the rebels, while the British recorded 27 fatalities.

The Upper Canada Rebellion, led by William Lyon Mackenzie, primarily comprised disaffected American-born farmers who opposed the preferential treatment of British settlers in the colony&#x27;s land grant system. The first confrontation occurred at the Battle of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern in Toronto on 5 December 1837. Most rebels dispersed after the battle, although a small faction remained until Loyalist and Black Loyalist militias attacked the tavern three days later. Mackenzie later seized Navy Island, declaring it the Republic of Canada, but fled to the US after the rebel ship &quot;Caroline&quot; was burned by Canadian volunteers. The Upper Canada Rebellion resulted in three deaths—two rebels and one loyalist. For the rest of 1838, Mackenzie&#x27;s followers and US sympathizers conducted a series of raids against Upper Canada known as the Patriot War.

The rebellions led to the &quot;Durham Report&quot;, which recommended uniting the Canadas. The Act of Union 1840 united Upper and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada and paved the way for the introduction of responsible government in 1848.

===Conflicts during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush===
The influx of gold prospectors into the Fraser Canyon during the Fraser Gold Rush led to several conflicts between prospectors and local First Nations. The Fraser Canyon War in 1858 saw the Nlaka&#x27;pamux and prospectors clash at the start of the gold rush. The Nlaka&#x27;pamux attacked several newly arrived American prospectors in defence of their territory, prompting the prospectors to form military companies to carry out reprisals. Responding to the violence, the British formed the colony of British Columbia on August 2 and sent gunboats to the Fraser River to reestablish order. However, as British military capabilities in the region were limited, they were unable to quickly assert control, leading to open conflict on August 9. A truce was brokered on 21 August, and the arrival of a British contingent by month&#x27;s end stabilized the area. Around 36 Nlakaʼpamux, including five chiefs, died during the conflict.

The Chilcotin War was another conflict that broke out in the area in April 1864, when the Tsilhqot&#x27;in killed 21 prospectors and construction workers who crossed into their territory. The attacks sparked a month-long armed standoff in the British Columbia Interior, after a group predominantly made up of American prospectors marched from the colonial capital of New Westminster to quell the resistance in the Crown&#x27;s name. The conflict ended with the mistaken arrest of a Tsilhqot&#x27;in peace delegation. Six delegates were convicted and hanged for murder, despite the Tsilhqot&#x27;in maintaining its actions were an act of war rather than murder. In 2018, the Canadian government exonerated the six individuals and issued an apology to the Tsilhqot&#x27;in, recognizing &quot;that they acted in accordance with their laws and traditions&quot; for war.

===American Civil War===
At the start of the American Civil War (1861–1865), the British Empire declared neutrality, although its colonies in British North America sold weapons to both sides of the war. Although some Canadian newspapers sympathized with the Confederate States of America due to its alignment with colonial &quot;security interests,&quot; the vast majority of the 40,000 Canadians who volunteered to fight in the Civil War did so with the Union Army. Most Canadians fought as volunteers, although some were coerced into service by American recruiters or &quot;crimpers&quot;. By the war&#x27;s end, 29 Canadian Union Army officers were awarded the Medal of Honor.

Incidents like the &quot;Trent&quot; and the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; affairs strained Anglo-American relations. The Trent Affair, the most serious incident of the war, occurred in 1861 when a US gunboat stopped the RMS &quot;Trent&quot; to seize two Confederate officials en route to the UK. The British demanded an apology and the release of the passengers. War appeared imminent in the months after, with the British reinforcing its North American garrison from 4,000 to 18,000 soldiers. However, the crisis abated after an apology was issued. The Empire was also criticized by Americans for allowing its subjects, including those in Canada, to engage in blockade running. According to one historian, these actions undermined the Union blockade against the Confederacy and prolonged the war by two years.

When the Union Army regained the initiative in 1863, Confederate agent, Jacob Thompson, was tasked with creating a northern front from Canada. With Confederate activities tolerated by Canadian authorities and citizens, Thompson set up bases in Montreal and Toronto. His plans included raiding prison camps to free Confederate prisoners and attacking Union ships in the Great Lakes. In 1864, Confederate raiders from Montreal raided St. Albans in Vermont, but they were defeated and were subsequently arrested at the border by British soldiers.

=== Fenian raids ===
In the mid-1860s, Irish American veterans of the Union Army who were members of the Fenian Brotherhood, supported raiding British North America to force Irish independence. The Fenians incorrectly assumed that Irish Canadians would support their invasion. However, the majority of Irish settlers in Canada West were Protestant, mainly of Anglo-Irish or Ulster-Scot descent, and largely loyal to the Crown. Nonetheless, the threat prompted British and Canadian agents in the US to redirect their focus from Confederate sympathizers to the Fenians in 1865. Upon learning of the Fenians&#x27; planned attack, 10,000 volunteers of the Canadian militia were mobilized in 1866, a number that later increased to 14,000, and then to 20,000.

The first raid took place in April 1866, as Fenians landed on Campobello Island and razed several buildings. The largest raid occurred on June 2 at the Battle of Ridgeway, where 750–800 Fenians repelled nearly 900 Canadian militiamen, largely due to the latter&#x27;s inexperience. However, the Fenians withdrew to the US shortly after, anticipating additional British and Canadian reinforcements. In the same month, another party of 200 Fenians was defeated near Pigeon Hill.

The threat of raids in 1870 led the government to mobilize 13,000 volunteers. Fenian raiding parties were defeated at the battles of Eccles Hill and Trout River in May 1870. In October 1871, 40 Fenians occupied a customs house near the Manitoba-Minnesota border, hoping to elicit support from Louis Riel and the Métis, but Riel raised volunteers to repel them. The US Army later intervened and arrested the Fenians, with the US not wanting to risk war with the UK.

While the militia prevented the Fenian from accomplishing its goals, the raids exposed deficiencies in its leadership, structure, and training, prompting subsequent reforms within it.

===British forces in Canada in the late–19th century===
By the mid-1860s, British North American colonies faced mounting pressure to assume their own defences as the UK sought to alleviate themselves of the cost of defending them and to redeploy troops to more strategic areas. British pressure and the American Civil War prompted various colonies to consider forming a single federation. Although some questioned the need to unite post-American Civil War, subsequent raids by Fenians made more people in British North America favourable to Canadian Confederation, which was eventually realized in 1867. 

In 1869, American grievances over British transgressions during the American Civil War became an issue, as the US demanded payment for said transgressions. A British delegation, including Canadian Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, negotiated the Treaty of Washington in 1871 to settle the issue. By 1871, most British North American colonies joined Canadian Confederation, and US grievances were settled. Consequently, British forces withdrew from Canada, except for Halifax and Esquimalt, where garrisons of the Pacific and North America and West Indies stations remained for reasons of imperial strategy. The Royal Navy continued to provide for Canada&#x27;s maritime defence, with the understanding that they would provide additional aid in emergencies.

====Canadian enlistment in British forces after 1871====
Canadian enlistment in the British military continued after Confederation and the British Army&#x27;s withdrawal in 1871. Several Canadians opted for British service over the Canadian militia, as the latter showed little interest in expeditionary combat. The British Army specifically targeted Canadians for recruitment to replenish certain units, like the 100th Regiment of Foot. Canadians continued joining the British Army&#x27;s enlisted ranks into the First World War, with several thousand Canadians serving in British units during the conflict.

The British War Office also reserved officer commissions for Canadian &quot;gentlemen and journeymen&quot; to fill vacancies and bolster the British officer corps. The recruitment of Canadians into the British officer corps was encouraged by the War Office as a way to promote military interoperability between Canada and the UK, and to make the Canadian government more amicable to the idea of its military participating in British overseas campaigns. By 1892, about two-thirds of Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) graduates who received commissions opted to join the British military rather than the Canadian militia.

By 1900, RMC graduates in the British military had participated in 27 campaigns across Africa, Burma, India, and China. From 1880 and 1918, around a quarter of RMC graduates accepted commissions in the British military. Recruitment of RMC officer cadets into the British military declined in the early 20th century due to efforts by Frederick William Borden, the Canadian minister of militia and defence. As a result, from 1911 to 1914, over half of all graduates pursuing military careers joined the Canadian militia rather than the British military.

===Canadian militia in the late–19th century===
By the mid-19th century, the militia system in the Province of Canada was organized into two classes, sedentary and Active. The sedentary militia, later called the &quot;Reserve Militia,&quot; was the traditional compulsory militia mobilized solely during emergencies. The Active Militia consisted initially of volunteer service battalions tasked with transport and operational duties.

The Active Militia began as an unpaid voluntary service but evolved into a paid part-time service under the Militia Act of 1855, comprising the Volunteer Militia, the Regular Militia, and the Marine Militia. The Volunteer Militia included artillery, cavalry, and infantry units. The Regular Militia comprised former serving men eligible for emergency service through balloting. The Marine Militia consisted of individuals employed to navigate Canada&#x27;s waterways. In 1862, proposed legislation to enhance the sedentary militia ignited a debate over whether the colony should rely on a compulsory or voluntary service. Following the 1863 general election, a new Militia Act was passed, shifting the burden of defence to the Active Militia while also preserving the sedentary militia. The militia system was adopted into the Canadian federation through the 1868 Militia Act. After the British Army&#x27;s departure in 1871, the Canadian militia shouldered the main responsibility for its defence.
The Active Militia underwent professionalization in the 1870s and 1880s, with the establishment of two professional artillery batteries in 1871. The Active Militia expanded under the 1883 Militia Act, authorizing a new cavalry troop, an additional artillery battery, and three infantry companies. These were intended to provide the professional backbone of the Permanent Force, a full-time &quot;continuous service&quot; component of the Active Militia. While the Active Militia&#x27;s professional elements grew in the 1870s and 1880s, its marine component dwindled, with the last marine militia unit disbanded in 1878. The sedentary militia also fell into disuse during this period as annual musters became less frequent. By 1883, the sedentary militia was nearly non-existent, with the requirement for annual musters stricken from legislation.

===Late–19th century conflicts in western Canada===
In October 1870, near present-day Lethbridge, one of the last major battles occurred between the Blackfoot Confederacy and the Cree known as the Battle of the Belly River. In the battle, Cree war party engaged a Piikani Nation camp but was defeated, unaware that members of the Kainai Nation and Piegan Blackfeet were also there. The Blackfoot&#x27;s use of revolving rifles likely aided in their victory. However their victory was pyrrhic, as their losses made them vulnerable to attack. Both sides lost as many as 300 warriors during the battle.

====Riel Rebellions====
In the late 19th century, Louis Riel spearheaded two resistances against the Canadian government amid its efforts to settle western Canada and negotiate land transfer treaties with multiple First Nations.

The first resistance led by Riel, the Red River Rebellion (1869–1870), occurred before the transfer of Rupert&#x27;s Land from the HBC to Canada. In December 1869, Riel and Métis settlers of the Red River Colony seized Upper Fort Garry to negotiate favourable terms for the colony&#x27;s entry into Canadian confederation. After an English-speaking settler was executed, a military expedition made up of 400 British regulars and 800 Canadian militiamen was organized to retake the fort. Riel and his followers fled to the US before the arrival of the expedition in August 1870. Although they fled, the resistance achieved its major objectives, with the federal government recognizing the rights of the Red River settlers through the establishment of the province of Manitoba.

In 1884, Riel returned from the US and rallied local Métis in the North-West Territories to press their grievances against the Canadian government. By March 1885, a Métis armed force established the Provisional Government of Saskatchewan, with Riel as president. A three-month insurgency, known as the North-West Rebellion, began later that month after Métis forces defeated a contingent of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) at the Battle of Duck Lake. The battle emboldened the Plains Cree under Big Bear, leading to attacks on Battleford, Frog Lake, and Fort Pitt.

In response, the Canadian government mobilized 3,000 militiamen to quell the resistance. General Frederick Middleton initially planned for the 3,000-person force to travel together by rail, but attacks at Battleford and Frog Lake forced him to send a 900-person force ahead of the main contingent. However, after the forward force was repelled at the Battle of Fish Creek, Middleton chose to wait for the rest of the contingent before successfully besieging Riel&#x27;s outnumbered forces at the Battle of Batoche. Although Riel was captured at Batoche in May, resistance from Big Bear&#x27;s followers persisted until 3 June at the Battle of Loon Lake. Canadian militia and NWMP casualties during the conflict include 58 killed and 93 wounded.

===Nile Expedition===

During the Mahdist War in 1884, the British requested aid from Canada for skilled boatmen to assist Major-General Charles Gordon&#x27;s besieged forces in Khartoum. The government&#x27;s reluctance led Governor General Lord Lansdowne to dispatch only 386 voyageurs, commanded by Canadian militia officers. This force, known as the Nile Voyageurs, served in Sudan and became the first Canadian force to serve outside North America. 

Arriving in Asyut in October 1884, the voyageurs transported 5,000 British troops upstream to Khartoum using wooden whaling boats. They arrived two days after the city&#x27;s capture by Mahdist forces. Canadian militia officers overseeing the voyageurs took part in the Battle of Kirbekan weeks later, although the voyageurs themselves did not partake. After Kirbekan, the expedition withdrew to Egypt, departing in April 1885. Sixteen members of the Canadian contingent died during the campaign.

== 20th century ==
=== Boer War ===
The issue of Canadian military participation in British imperial campaigns arose again when the British requested Canadian assistance in the Second Boer War (1899–1902). Most of English Canada supported participation, while near-universal opposition came from French Canadians and other groups. This split the governing Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who&#x27;s political base comprised both pro-imperial Anglo-Canadians and anti-imperial Franco-Canadians.

Laurier aimed for a compromise to preserve Anglo-French relations, but faced pressure from his imperial-minded cabinet to send a token force of 1,000 soldiers from the Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry. Two additional contingents followed, one comprising 6,000 volunteers from the Royal Canadian Dragoons and Canadian Mounted Rifles, and the third, Strathcona&#x27;s Horse, was financed by The Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal. Many Canadians also served in the British Army&#x27;s South African Constabulary.

Canadian forces arrived in South Africa after the initial phase of the conflict, which included British setbacks during Black Week. They earned praise for leading the final night attack that led to the Boers surrender at the Battle of Paardeberg. At the Battle of Leliefontein in November 1900, three members of the Royal Canadian Dragoons were awarded the Victoria Cross for protecting the rear of a retreating force, marking the only occasion when a Canadian unit received three Victoria Crosses in a single action. One of the last major battles involving Canadian units was the Battle of Hart&#x27;s River in March 1902. During the conflict, Canadian forces played a role in maintaining British-run concentration camps.

Around 8,600 Canadians volunteered for service during the Boer War. About 7,400 Canadians, including 12 nursing sisters, served in South Africa. Of these, 224 died, 252 were wounded, and five were awarded the Victoria Cross. A wave of celebrations swept the country after the war, marked by many towns erecting their first war memorials. However, the public debate over Canada&#x27;s role in the conflict strained relations between English and French Canada.

=== Early 20th century military developments ===

Discussions about reforming the Canadian Militia into a fully professional army arose during the Second Boer War. Lord Dundonald, the final British Army General Officer Commanding the Canadian Militia, implemented reforms that granted Canada its own technical and support branches. This included the Engineer Corps (1903), Signalling Corps (1903), Service Corps (1903), Ordnance Stores Corps (1903), Corps of Guides (1903), Medical Corps (1904), Staff Clerks (1905), and Army Pay Corps (1906). Additional corps would be created in the years before and during the First World War, including the first separate military dental corps.

At the turn of the century, Canada asserted greater control over its defences with the passage of a new Militia Act in 1904, appointing a Canadian Chief of the General Staff. Additionally, control of the Imperial fortress of Halifax and Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard was transferred to Canada by the British military in 1906. The Militia Act of 1904 also formally acknowledged the obsolescence of the sedentary Reserve Militia by removing the provision that designated male inhabitants of military age as members, replacing it with a provision theoretically making them &quot;liable to serve in the militia&quot;.

==== Creation of a Canadian navy ====
Canada initially maintained a small fishing protection force under the Department of Marine and Fisheries but depended on the UK for maritime defence. However, as the British engaged in a naval arms race with Germany, it looked to its dominions to assist with Imperial naval strategy in 1908. The Conservative Party advocated for Canada to contribute funds solely for the purchase and maintenance of Royal Navy vessels. Some French Canadian nationalists opposed sending any aid, while others proposed establishing an independent Canadian navy capable of assisting the British when necessary.

Prime Minister Laurier adopted a compromised position, leading to the creation of the Canadian Naval Service in 1910, later designated as the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) in August 1911. To appease imperialists, the Naval Service Act included a provision allowing the RCN to be transferred to the British in emergency cases. The bill aimed to build a fleet of five cruisers and six destroyers. The first two ships, &quot;Niobe&quot; and , were somewhat outdated vessels purchased from the British. However, the election of a Conservative government in 1911 led to a reduction in funding, although later increased during the First World War.

=== First World War ===
On August 5, 1914, the British Empire, including Canada, entered the First World War (1914–1918) as a part of the Entente powers. As a dominion of the Empire, Canada had control over its contributions to the war effort. During the war, Canadian military spending rose considerably, with its financing being supported by the introduction of income taxes and Victory Loan campaigns. Canada also sold munitions to Britain after it experienced a shell shortage, prompting the establishment of the Imperial Munitions Board.

A total of 619,636 people served in the Canadian military during the war. Of those, 59,544 were killed and 154,361 were wounded. The conflict provided Canada with a greater degree of autonomy within the British Empire and a modest diplomatic presence at the Paris Peace Conference.

====Canadian Expeditionary Force====

The Canadian Militia was not mobilized. Instead, an separate Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) was raised for the conflict. The CEF comprised infantry battalions and the Canadian Cavalry Brigade, with recruitment handled by the militia. Canada also established the Canadian Forestry Corps to harvest wood from France and Scotland for the war effort.

The first Canadian contingent departed for Europe on October 3, 1914. The CEF&#x27;s first large engagement was the Second Battle of Ypres from April–May 1915. At Ypres, Canadian soldiers withstood the first large-scale use of poison gas in history. In September 1915, after Ypres, the Canadian Corps was formed with the arrival of the 2nd Canadian Division in France, consolidating the CEF. The corps expanded with the 3rd Canadian Division joining in December 1915, followed by the 4th Canadian Division in August 1916. The 5th Canadian Division, formed in February 1917, never fully formed and was disbanded in February 1918.

In early 1916, Canadian divisions participated in local actions like the Actions of St Eloi Craters and the Battle of Mont Sorrel. The British Somme Offensive began on July 1, where on its first day, the Royal Newfoundland Regiment was annihilated. Canadian divisions were deployed to the Somme in August 1916. After the Somme Offensive, Canadian leaders advocated for the corps to operate as a unified force rather than being dispersed among different British units. The Canadian Corps, comprising four divisions, was consolidated for the Battle of Vimy Ridge, a crucial phase of the Battle of Arras.

After Vimy Ridge, Canadian Lieutenant-General Arthur Currie assumed command of the corps. Under his leadership, the corps fought in the Battle of Hill 70 and the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. In 1918, the corps was sent to Amiens to bolster the lines during the Hundred Days Offensive. Throughout the war&#x27;s later stages, the corps earned a reputation as one of the most capable and esteemed formations on the Western Front. Throughout this period, the Canadian Corps participated in key battles such as Amiens and the Cambrai. The Canadian Corps&#x27; rapid advance from Amiens in August to Mons by the armistice on November 11th, is known as Canada&#x27;s Hundred Days.

====Air and sea operations====
During the war, the RCN primarily conducted coastal submarine patrols as part of the Atlantic U-boat campaign. Canada suffered from several maritime disasters during the war. The Halifax Explosion occurred on December 6, 1917, when a ship collision involving a munition ship loaded with explosives caused one of the largest human-made explosions before the detonation of the first atomic bomb. The disaster saw 11,000 casualties, including 2,000 dead, and the entire north end of the city destroyed. The sinking of by a U-boat in June 1918 marks the deadliest Canadian naval disaster of the war.

Besides the Canadian military, Canadians served in British forces such as the Royal Navy and the Royal Flying Corps. By war&#x27;s end, nearly a quarter of all Royal Flying Corps pilots were Canadian, including the Empire&#x27;s leading flying ace, Billy Bishop.

====Conscription====
Although enthusiasm to enlist was strong in 1914, by 1916, enthusiasm had waned. At the 1917 Imperial War Cabinet, Britain urged its dominions to alleviate manpower shortages caused by the collapse of the Russian Empire and the French Army mutinies. To maintain Canada&#x27;s contributions, Prime Minister Robert Borden advocated for conscription in the 1917 federal election, sparking a national debate and crisis. The debate highlighted divisions between English and French Canada, with English Canada largely supporting it, while French Canadians, some English-speaking farmers, trade union leaders, pacifists, and Indigenous leaders opposing it.

Borden&#x27;s Unionist Party, a coalition of pro-conscription Conservatives and Liberals, won the election and passed the Military Service Act, 1917, although it included various exemption provisions. After conscription was implemented in 1918, over 400,000 were called up, but 380,510 appealed for exemption. Ultimately, only 24,132 conscripts were sent to Europe.

====Commemoration====
The war&#x27;s impact led to the construction of war memorials in Canada. The Canadian National War Memorial was unveiled in 1939 and has since been used to honour Canadian war dead for other conflicts. There are also eight memorials in France and Belgium to honour Canada&#x27;s war dead from the war, like the Canadian National Vimy Memorial.

Distinct memorials honour the contributions of Newfoundland soldiers, then a separate British dominion. The largest Newfoundland memorials include the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial in France and the Newfoundland National War Memorial in St. John&#x27;s.

===Interwar period===
After the First World War, the Canadian Expeditionary Force dissolved, and its lineage perpetuated through the Canadian militia. In 1921, the Active Militia was restructured, forming the Permanent Active Militia from Permanent Force, and the Non-Permanent Active Militia from its reserve component. The National Defence Act of 1922 consolidated the Department of Militia and Defence with Air and Naval Services under the Department of National Defence.

The greater degree of autonomy Canada saw after the First World War, coupled with public reluctance to participate in further imperial conflicts, led the Canadian government to refuse a British request for military aid during the 1922 Chanak Crisis.

====Intervention in Russia====
The Canadian government sent around 6,000 soldiers to aid the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in mid-1918 in response to a British request for assistance. Around 4,200 soldiers of the Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force (CSEF) were deployed to Vladivostok, while another Canadian contingent joined the Allied North Russian Expeditionary Force in northwest Russia. Canadian soldiers were deployed to northwest Russia in May 1918, while CSEF was deployed to Vladivastok in October.

Shortly after the end of the First World War, the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada debated the continued military presence in Russia. A decision was made to extend the commitment until spring 1919, although they limited the use of its forces, requiring their explicit consent for their use.

Although some Canadians died in combat as pilots over the Black Sea, the majority of Canadian soldiers stationed in Russia experienced minimal combat before their withdrawal. CSEF soldiers began their withdrawal from Russia in April 1919. The 16th Canadian Field Artillery Brigade withdrew from northwest Russia in June 1919. In total, 21 Canadians died in the Russia intervention, the majority from disease or accidents.

====Establishing an air force====
The First World War spurred the formation of Canada&#x27;s air force. Initially, Canada lacked an independent air force, although many Canadians served with the British Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service.

In 1914, the Canadian government authorized the formation of the Canadian Aviation Corps, tasked to accompany the Canadian Expeditionary Force to Europe with one aircraft, a Burgess-Dunne. However, the corps was disbanded in 1915. In 1918, the British Air Ministry established a Canadian bomber and fighter squadron in Europe, marking a second attempt at forming a Canadian air force. The Canadian government later assumed control of these two squadrons, forming the Canadian Air Force. This air force, however, never saw service and was completely disbanded by 1921.

During the 1920s, the British government urged Canada to establish a peacetime air force, offering surplus aircraft. In 1920, the Canadian Air Force (CAF) was created under the Air Board, serving as a part-time or militia service for flying refresher training. After a reorganization the CAF became responsible for all flying operations in Canada, including civil aviation. The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) took over civil flying responsibilities from the Air Board and CAF after its creation in April 1924. The Second World War saw the RCAF become a true military service.

====Spanish Civil War====
Canada did not participate in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), although over 1,500 Canadians volunteered to fight for the Spanish Republican faction. Most volunteers were recent immigrants, Communist Party members, and former relief camp workers. 

Canadian volunteers initially joined the British Battalion, although 40 Canadians also joined the Lincoln and the George Washington battalions. In July 1937, the primarily Canadian Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion was mustered into the XV International Brigade. The battalion fought in five major campaigns, including the Battle of Teruel, the Aragon Offensive, and the Battle of the Ebro. Between 400 to 721 Canadian volunteers died in the war.

===Second World War===

The Second World War (1939–1945) began on September 1, 1939, with Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland. Canada issued a declaration of war against Germany on September 10. Although Canada was a significant contributor to the war, it played no major role in its strategic planning, as Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King refrained from involvement.

The fall of Belgium and France to Germany in June 1940 led Canada to drastically expand its military spending and armed forces, and implement conscription for home defence. Like the First World War, conscription for overseas service was a divisive issue, with some English Canadians supporting it and French Canadians opposing it. The Conscription Crisis of 1944 saw Mackenzie King pressured to accept conscription for overseas service.

Hostilities ceased in September 1945. Around 1.1 million Canadians served in the military during the war, with over 45,000 casualties and 55,000 wounded.

====Canadian Army operations====
The Canadian Militia (renamed the Canadian Army in November 1940) saw minimal action early in the war, with the 1st Canadian Division only briefly deploying alongside the Second British Expeditionary Force during the fall of France in June 1940. After the British withdrawal from Dunkirk, the 1st Canadian Division was one of few fully intact formations left in the UK in terms of equipment and manpower. By late 1940, multiple Canadian units were stationed in the UK to defend against a potential German invasion. 

In December 1941, two Canadian battalions participated in the Battle of Hong Kong, while the 2nd Canadian Division led the Dieppe Raid in August 1942. The First Canadian Army was also formed in 1942, to prepare for the invasion of northwest Europe.

In July 1943, the 1st and 5th Canadian Divisions took part in the Allied invasion of Sicily as part of the British Eighth Army. They also participated in the Allied invasion of Italy, facing intense combat in the Battle of Ortona and the Moro River Campaign. In spring 1944, Canadian units under Lieutenant-General E. L. M. Burns played a leading role in breaking through the Hitler Line, and later breached the Gothic Line after the Battle of Rimini. In total, 92,757 Canadian soldiers served in the Italian campaign, with 5,764 casualties.
On June 6, 1944, during the Normandy landings, the 3rd Canadian Division and the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade secured Juno Beach, supported by earlier landings of Canadian airborne troops behind the beaches. The Canadians led the breakout from the Normandy bridgehead, notably at the Falaise pocket. Afterwards, the First Canadian Army conducted campaigns to clear coastal fortress, like Operation Astonia. From October to November, the Canadians fought a series of battles to secure the Scheldt and open Antwerp to Allied shipping.

In early 1945, Canadian units fought in the Siegfried Line campaign, clearing a path to the Rhine and enabling Allied offensives further beyond the river. After the campaign, the First Canadian Army participated in the liberation of the Netherlands and the Western Allied invasion of Germany. Around 237,000 Canadian soldiers served in North West Europe campaign in 1944 and 1945, among whom 11,336 died.

====Naval operations====

The RCN expanded significantly during the war, with 99,688 servicemen, around 6,500 servicewomen, and 471 combat ships by war&#x27;s end. The navy protected supply and troop convoys from U-boat wolfpacks during the Battle of the Atlantic. After the Atlantic Convoy Conference in 1943, all Allied convoys north of New York City were coordinated through the Canadian Northwest Atlantic Command. RCN warships sank 33 enemy U-boats during the war.

In addition to the Atlantic campaign, the RCN participated in the Dunkirk evacuation, the Allied landing in North Africa, and the Normandy landings. The light cruiser also participated in the Pacific War as a part of the British Pacific Fleet. The navy lost 24 warships during the war, the largest being the destroyer . In addition to the RCN, Canadians also served with the Canadian Merchant Navy.

====Air operations====

The RCAF also contributed to the war effort, although its manpower was initially hindered by the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP), which trained aircrews for the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. While Canada hosted most BCATP facilities and funded three-quarters of the costs, the British expected graduates to join the Royal Air Force (RAF). However, intervention from Mackenzie King allowed some Canadian graduates to join the RCAF instead. As a result of the earlier arrangement, many Canadian BCATP graduates served in RAF units like No. 242 (Canadian) Squadron RAF, instead of RCAF units. At its peak, BCATP included 107 schools and 184 ancillary units across Canada. By the end of 1945, 131,553 pilots graduated from BCATP in Canada, serving with the RAF, RCAF, or other Allied air forces.

Although the BCATP initially delayed the RCAF&#x27;s deployment overseas, by war&#x27;s end, 48 RCAF squadrons were stationed abroad. They participated in campaigns like the Battle of Britain and the Combined Bomber Offensive. By the war&#x27;s end, Canadian airmen served in every major theatre, including North Africa, Italy, northwest Europe, and the Pacific. Canadian airmen in Canada participated in the Aleutian Islands campaign and conducted anti-submarine operations in the Atlantic. Throughout the war, 232,632 men and 17,030 women served in the RCAF, with 17,101 dead. By the end of the war, the RCAF was the fourth-largest Allied air force.

====Industry and research====

Canadian industries produced 815,729 units of war materials during the conflict, including small arms, warships, aircraft, and vehicles. Over half of Canada&#x27;s output was sent to the UK, facilitated by the Billion Dollar Gift package. Labour shortages prompted many women to enter the workforce for the first time, filling roles left by enlisted men. The Canadian Women&#x27;s Army Corps and the RCAF Women&#x27;s Division were created to relieve servicemen for frontline duties.

Canada also supported British and American efforts to develop an atomic bomb. In 1942, the Canadian government acquired the Eldorado Mine to mine uranium, and formed a nuclear research partnership with the UK, establishing the Montreal Laboratory to house the British Tube Alloys nuclear program. The British and Americans agreed to cooperate on nuclear weapons development during the First Quebec Conference in 1943, and the Montreal Laboratory was absorbed into the Manhattan Project.

=== Cold War ===


The defection of a Soviet cipher clerk in Ottawa in September 1945 and subsequent allegations of a Soviet spy ring marked the beginning of the Cold War in Canada. As a founding NATO member and NORAD signatory, Canada was aligned with the Western Bloc against the Communist bloc. In the 1950s, Canada partnered with the U.S. to establish early-warning radar systems, including the Pinetree Line, Mid-Canada Line, and the DEW Line, to defend against Soviet attacks.

As a middle power, Canada recognized its military constraints and embraced multilateralism, making its military contributions dependent upon being part of a larger multilateral coalition. As a result, it refrained from direct involvement in conflicts like the Vietnam War, despite the involvement of close allies.

==== Korean War ====

At the start of the Korean War (1950–1953), Canada quickly backed the establishment of a United Nations military force to liberate South Korea. Canadian units in Korea were integrated into the larger British Commonwealth Forces Korea. Canada initially contributed three RCN destroyers and the No. 426 Squadron, a RCAF military transport squadron, to support the war effort. Eight RCN ships rotated duties in Korean waters during the war, protecting the UN fleet and supporting onshore operations. In Korea, 22 RCAF fighter pilots also flew jets on exchange duty with the United States Air Force (USAF). 

Having undergone rapid demilitarization after the Second World War, the Canadian Army required several months to mobilize back to wartime strength. Domestic pressure for a larger commitment led the Canadian Army to form Special Force (later renamed the 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade) for deployment in Korea. The first Canadian Army units arrived in Korea in December 1950, joining the conflict after its early campaigns and when the attrition phase began. For army units, the war was characterized as a &quot;war of patrols&quot; in mountainous terrain. Battles the Canadian Army fought in include the battles of Kapyong and Kowang-san.

Canada sent 26,791 troops to fight in Korea. There were 1,558 Canadian casualties, including 516 dead. Hostilities ceased with the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement. Following the armistice, Canada stationed a garrison in the region to patrol the Korean Demilitarized Zone until 1955. The last Canadian soldiers under United Nations Command departed the region in 1957.

==== Forces in Europe ====
During the Cold War, Canada deployed its military abroad for the first time during peacetime, maintaining units in Western Europe from the early 1950s to 1993. Around 100,000 Canadian military personnel served in France and West Germany as part of Canadian Forces Europe.

In adherence to NATO obligations, Canada formed the 27th Canadian Infantry Brigade (27CIBG), later designated as 4 Combat Group and 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade, for service in West Germany. It initially comprised 6,700 soldiers organized into several units, including three infantry battalions, an armoured regiment, and MGR-1 Honest John nuclear missile batteries. The brigade was reorganized following a 1970 defence review, losing its nuclear capability and reducing its size. By 1977, it transitioned from a frontline role as a part of the British commitment in northern Germany to a rear area reserve force in the south.

In addition to the 27CIBG, Canada contributed two infantry battalion groups to NATO&#x27;s quick reaction force, Allied Command Europe Mobile Force, in 1964. However, by the late 1960s, the commitment was reduced to one battalion. The Canadian Air-Sea Transportable Brigade Group (CAST), comprising 5,000 personnel, was another unit formed in 1968 to support Canada&#x27;s European commitments. Though stationed in Canada, CAST was able to deploy to Norway within 30 days. CAST only deployed once for a military exercise in 1986 before disbandment in 1989.

In 1951, Canada formed the 1 Air Division to fulfil NATO air defence obligations. Initially a day/all-weather interception squadron, its role shifted to nuclear strike and reconnaissance in 1962, and then solely to reconnaissance in 1966. The 1 Air Division initially comprised two wings in France and two in Germany, although RCAF assets in France were relocated to Germany after the French withdrawal from NATO in 1966.

==== Unification of Canada&#x27;s military ====

Canada began exploring military unification in the 1930s, having unified some administrative aspects and its military colleges by the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s, Canada pursued full military unification to reduce costs and eliminate service duplication. In 1964, the National Defence Act was amended to create a unified command structure under a single Chief of the Defence Staff. The Canadian Forces Reorganization Act, 1968 then merged the Army, RCN, and RCAF into a singular Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), ending their existence as separate entities.

The unification of Canada&#x27;s military was only partly successful, with support services and headquarters commands being successfully unified, and its cost-cutting measures praised. However, changes the move to a unified ranking structure and service uniforms faced resistance from CAF personnel and the public. Due to ongoing resistance from the army, air force, and navy, many of those changes were reversed by 2014.

====October Crisis====
The October Crisis was instigated by the Montreal-based Front de libération du Québec&#x27;s (FLQ) kidnapping of two government officials. On October 15, 1970, five days after the second kidnapping, the Quebec government requested military aid under the National Defence Act, with soldiers deployed to strategic locations in Montreal hours later. The following day, the federal government invoked the War Measures Act to confront the &quot;apprehended insurrection,&quot; marking its only peacetime use.

Under the War Measures Act, the FLQ was banned and civil liberties were suspended. Troops were deployed to Quebec until January 1971. Ultimately, 12,500 Canadian Forces troops were stationed in Quebec, with 7,500 in Montreal. The federal government&#x27;s use of the War Measures Act sparked controversy due to the unjust detention of the majority of those arrested. This played a role in its replacement with the more restrained Emergencies Act in 1988.

==== Vietnam War ====
Canada was a non-belligerent during the Vietnam War (1955–1975), and took part in two international truce commissions, the International Control Commission and the International Commission of Control and Supervision. Canada&#x27;s military involvement in the conflict was minimal, with a small contingent deployed in 1973 to enforce the Paris Peace Accords.

Throughout the conflict, Canada became a haven for American Vietnam War resisters, with around 20,000 Vietnam draft dodgers and 12,000 military deserters seeking refuge in the country. However, in a countercurrent to the movement of American draft dodgers and deserters to Canada, around 12,000 Canadians and Canadian-American dual citizens enlisted with the United States Armed Forces and served in combat roles in Vietnam. Between 110 and 134 Canadians died during the conflict. In 2009, seven remained listed as missing in action.

=== Post-Cold War ===
In the 1990s, the CAF participated in multinational missions responding to international crises. The CAF also provided aid within Canada after several natural disasters, deploying over 8,500 military personnel to Manitoba after the 1997 Red River flood, over 16,000 to aid in New Brunswick, Ontario, and Quebec after the North American ice storm of 1998. The 1998 ice storm marked the largest-ever Canadian military response to a domestic natural disaster and the largest operational deployment since the Korean War.

==== Oka Crisis ====
The Oka Crisis was a land dispute between a group of Mohawk and Oka, Quebec, from July 11 to September 26, 1990. Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa invoked Section 275 of the National Defence Act on August 8, requesting military support in &quot;aid of the civil power&quot;, after one police officer and two Mohawk were killed.

Around 4,000 regular and reserve troops from Quebec were mobilized to support provincial authorities. Troops and equipment were mobilized at staging areas around Kanesatake and Kahnawake, while reconnaissance aircraft conducted missions over Mohawk territory to gather intelligence. A month after the military&#x27;s deployment, the crisis ended with the departure of land defenders from the disputed grounds.

==== Gulf War ====
Canada quickly joined the US-led UN coalition after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Over 5,100 CAF personnel served, with 2,700 in theatre at its peak. Operations were coordinated under Operation Friction. The Gulf War marked the first time female CAF members served in combat roles.

A Canadian naval task force was sent to support the coalition, comprising destroyers and , and the supply ship . The Canadian Task Group led the coalition maritime logistics forces in the Persian Gulf. Canadian warships conducted about a quarter of all inspections of vessels suspected of breaching the coalition blockade. Another destroyer, , arrived after hostilities ceased and was the first allied ship to visit Kuwait. 
The CAF also deployed a CF-18 Hornet and CH-124 Sea King squadron. When the air campaign began, 24 Canadian CF-18s joined coalition forces in providing air cover and targeting ground assets, including assisting in the destruction of the Iraqi Navy during the Battle of Bubiyan. The air war in Iraq was the first offensive combat operation Canadian military personnel took part in since the Korean War.

A 530-person military field hospital was also deployed by the CAF, attached to a larger British unit. In 1991, photographs of Canadian Military Engineers posing with dismembered bodies in a Kuwaiti minefield led to the unit being investigated.

==== Somali Civil War ====

The CAF supported UNOSOM I in the Somali Civil War, aiding in security, humanitarian relief, and ceasefire monitoring. In December 1992, the first US-led, UN-sanctioned force, UNITAF, arrived in Somalia. UNITAF involved 23 countries, including Canada, which contributed around 1,400 soldiers from the Canadian Airborne Regiment and the naval support ship . In May 1993 the operation came under UN command and was renamed UNOSOM II. Due to resistance from certain local factions, UNOSOM II struggled to end the conflict, enforce a ceasefire, or secure cooperation from local warlords. Consequently, it focused on protecting food and medical aid distribution sites rather than restoring order. 

Based primarily in Beledweyne, Canadian forces rebuilt infrastructure, cleared landmines, and guarded aid convoys. However, the mission became a political disaster for Canada. Canadian soldiers were frequently harassed and their base often targeted by looters. In response, their commander authorized looters to be shot in the leg if they ran. Another officer later allowed thieves to be &quot;captured and abused.&quot; In March 1993, members of the airborne unit were involved in two extrajudicial killings. The first involved a civilian who was shot while fleeing after breaking into their base for supplies, and the second involved a youth who was tortured and killed after breaking into the encampment. Cover-up attempts by senior officials at the Department of National Defence sparked a national scandal in Canada. A federal inquiry into the matter saw the end of several officers&#x27; careers, court-martials, and the airborne regiment&#x27;s disbandment. The scandal damaged Canada&#x27;s international reputation and was heralded as &quot;the darkest era in the history of the Canadian military&quot; since the Second World War.

The UN mission itself failed to restore order, with mounting casualties prompting the US to withdraw its forces after the Battle of Mogadishu. This experience largely halted the use of robust multinational military forces from western countries for humanitarian aid during civil conflicts.

==== Yugoslav Wars ====
Since 1991, about 40,000 CAF personnel and civilian police, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, participated in Balkans peacekeeping missions, beginning with the European Community Monitoring Mission in the Former Yugoslavia in 1991. This involvement spanned UN missions like UNCRO in Croatia, UNMIBH in Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNMIK in Kosovo, and UNPREDEP in North Macedonia. Additionally, they contributed to NATO missions such as IFOR and SFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Kosovo Force, and task forces Harvest and Fox in North Macedonia, as well as EU missions like EUFOR Concordia and Operation Althea.

In September 1993, the largest battle involving Canadian military personnel since the Korean War occurred when Canadian and French peacekeepers under UNPROFOR fought Croat forces for 15 hours. The Canadian-French contingent was tasked with securing the Medak pocket, a strategic salient between Croat and Serb forces when Operation Medak Pocket was launched by Croat forces. Initially targeting Serb positions, on September 15, Croat forces besieged the Canadian-French position at Medak pocket, prompting them to respond. The Canadian government reported 27 Croatian soldiers killed and four Canadians wounded during the exchange.

The CAF also contributed warships to NATO&#x27;s maritime blockade of the region, and 18 CF-18 Hornets to support the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. During the bombing campaign, Canadian CF-18s flew 678 sorties, about 10 per cent of all NATO strike missions.

== 21st century ==

During the early 21st century, Canada participated in multiple missions in support of the global war on terror, including the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom. This included security operations conducted in the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman from 2001 to 2012. This deployment marked the Canadian navy&#x27;s largest since World War II, with 15 warships dispatched. At its peak in January 2002, six Canadian warships and 1,500 personnel were in the region, conducting patrols and intercepting suspected terrorists and illegal drug shipments.

While Canada participated in several multinational missions in the early 2000s, it abstained from joining the US-led coalition of the willing during the Iraq War. Although Canada was not directly involved in the Iraq War, its forces did help to relieve US naval assets during that conflict by expanding the CAF&#x27;s role in Combined Task Force 151, a multinational task force combating piracy off the coast of Somalia. Several Canadians, serving as exchange officers with British and US units, also participated in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Conversely, some US military personnel who opposed the Iraq War sought refuge in Canada after deserting to avoid deployment.

=== War in Afghanistan ===
Weeks after the September 11th attacks, Canada committed to joining the US-led war in Afghanistan (2001–2021). Canadian special forces participated in the initial invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, with an additional Canadian infantry battle group of 1,200 soldiers deployed to Kandahar in February 2002 to combat al-Qaeda and Taliban forces and support humanitarian efforts.

Following the invasion, Canadian units operated within NATO&#x27;s International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The CAF contributed a 2,000-strong infantry battle group, alongside armoured, artillery, and aerial support, to ISAF. The battle group was stationed in Kabul from 2003 to 2005, tasked with providing security and disarming Afghan militias. In November 2005, the CAF launched Operation Archer, shifting its focus from Kabul to Kandahar. After its relocation to Kandahar, the battle group oversaw counter-insurgency operations and the province&#x27;s Provincial Reconstruction Team. In Kandahar, the battle group achieved a series of victories like Operation Medusa. However, they were unable to root out all insurgents in the region, who took refuge on the Pakistani side of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. 

Public support for the war in Canada waned as casualties mounted in late 2006. This contributed to the selection of &quot;the Canadian soldier&quot; as the Canadian Press&#x27; Canadian Newsmaker of the Year. Support for the war dropped further after Joint Task Force 2 members were photographed handing over detainees to Afghan security forces, who were subsequently tortured. Despite mounting public opposition, the government remained committed to the war until 2011, partly due to the CAF&#x27;s portrayal of the war as a success. In 2011, Canada ended its combat operations in Afghanistan. However, some Canadian soldiers remained until March 2014 to train the Afghan National Army and National Police under NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan. Canadian Special Operations Forces Command personnel were briefly redeployed to Afghanistan during the 2021 Taliban offensive to evacuate Canadian citizens, close its embassy, and assist with the Kabul airlift.

Over 40,000 Canadian soldiers served in Afghanistan. The 12-year mission marked Canada&#x27;s longest military campaign, with 165 Canadians killed, including 158 soldiers and seven civilians. The conflict marked the first instance a female CAF member was killed in combat, Captain Nichola Goddard of the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery.

=== Libyan Civil War ===
On 25 February 2011, the CAF launched Operation Mobile, an evacuation mission in response to the First Libyan Civil War. On March 19, the operation expanded to include air and maritime combat missions to support the 2011 military intervention in Libya to enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1973. NATO assumed command of the multinational coalition through Operation Unified Protector, with Lieutenant General Charles Bouchard of the RCAF appointed as operational commander. The coalition enforced a no-fly zone to prevent pro-Gaddafi forces from conducting air attacks on anti-Gaddafi forces and civilian areas.

At its peak, 655 Canadians were deployed on Operation Mobile, including seven CF-18 fighter jets. The frigate , already in the Mediterranean as a part of Standing NATO Maritime Group 1, also patrolled Libya&#x27;s coast. In May 2011, &quot;Charlottetown&quot; came under hostile fire from a shore battery, marking the first attack on a Canadian warship since the Korean War. On October 28, Prime Minister Stephen Harper declared the successful end of the mission.

=== Mali War ===

In 2012, insurgent groups took control of parts of Mali, prompting the Malian government to request military aid from France in January 2013. France sought assistance from NATO allies to support its operation in Mali, including Canada, which initially provided a C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft. From 2015 to 2022, the CAF supported French counter-insurgency operations in the Sahel, deploying over 1,250 personnel for helicopter medical evacuations from 2018 to 2019.

The CAF started a phased withdrawal from Mali in 2019 as the Romanian Armed Forces assumed responsibility of helicopter medevacs for the operation. All CAF personnel were withdrawan from Mali in November 2023.

===War against the Islamic State===
In September 2014, Canada joined a global coalition against the Islamic State. From November 2014 to February 2016, Canadian CF-18s conducted 251 airstrikes in Iraq and five in Syria. In February 2016, the CAF reoriented its mission from combat operations to training, reducing the size of its mission. The mission deployments are based at a logistics hub in Kuwait and include training missions in Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon.

Canadian special forces were deployed to support the training mission. In 2021, they participated in two Iraqi Armed Forces operations in non-combat roles. Another Canadian special forces operator was involved in Talon Anvil, a 20-person USAF special operations group criticized for bypassing rules intended to safeguard civilians, resulting in hundreds of non-combatant deaths. The CAF&#x27;s increased use of special forces reflects a shift in military thinking, increasingly relying on these units over conventional forces to address asymmetric threats in grey-zone operations. A 2017 defense policy review acknowledged this trend and anticipated it would continue in the foreseeable future.

== Peacekeeping efforts ==
Canada has participated in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN effort from its inception to 1989. Over 125,000 Canadians served as peacekeepers, with around 130 Canadians having died during these operations. Canada&#x27;s support for multilateralism and internationalism are closely tied to its peacekeeping efforts.

Canada&#x27;s role in the development of and participation in peacekeeping during the 20th century shaped its reputation as a positive middle power. Canada&#x27;s successful mediation of the 1956 Suez Crisis gave it credibility as a country committed to the common good. The Canadian public increasingly identified peacekeeping as the country&#x27;s foremost contribution to international affairs.

Canada faced controversy over its involvement in some peacekeeping missions, prompting a military reassessment in the late 1990s. By the 21st century, Canadian involvement in UN peacekeeping greatly declined, with its peacekeeping efforts reallocated to UN-sanctioned operations through NATO. This shift resulted in more militarized and lethal peacekeeping operations, rather than traditional peacekeeping duties.

<text>Nutan Samarth-Bahl ( Samarth; 4 June 1936 – 21 February 1991), known mononymously as Nutan was an Indian actress who worked primarily in Hindi films. In a career spanning four decades, she appeared in more than 80 films, that ranged in genre from urban romances to socio-realist dramas. Regarded as one of the finest actresses in the history of Indian cinema, Nutan was noted for her naturalistic acting in parts of conflicted women often deemed unconventional. She was the recipient of six Filmfare Awards, including a record five Filmfare Award for Best Actress. In 1974, Nutan received the Padma Shri, India&#x27;s fourth highest civilian award.

Born in Bombay to filmmaker Kumarsen Samarth and film actress Shobhna Samarth, Nutan started her career at the age of 14 in the 1950 film &quot;Hamari Beti&quot;, directed by her mother. She subsequently starred in the films &quot;Nagina&quot; and &quot;Hum Log&quot; (both 1951). Her role in &quot;Seema&quot; (1955) garnered her wider recognition and her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress. She continued playing leading roles through the 1960s until the late 1970s and went onto win the award on four other occasions for her roles in &quot;Sujata&quot; (1959), &quot;Bandini&quot; (1963), &quot;Milan&quot; (1967) and &quot;Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki&quot; (1978). Some of her other films of this period include &quot;Anari&quot; (1959), &quot;Chhalia&quot; (1960), &quot;Tere Ghar Ke Saamne&quot; (1963), &quot;Khandan&quot; (1965), &quot;Saraswatichandra&quot; (1968), &quot;Anuraag&quot; (1972) and &quot;Saudagar&quot; (1973).

In the 1980s, Nutan started playing character roles and continued working until shortly before her death. She portrayed mostly motherly roles in such films as &quot;Saajan Ki Saheli&quot; (1981), &quot;Meri Jung&quot; (1985) and &quot;Naam&quot; (1986). Her performance in &quot;Meri Jung&quot; earned her a sixth and final Filmfare Award, in the Best Supporting Actress category. Nutan was married to naval Lieutenant-Commander Rajnish Bahl from 1959 until her death from breast cancer in 1991. Their only child, son Mohnish Bahl is an actor.

==Early life and family==
Nutan Samarth-Bahl was born on 4 June 1936 in Bombay into a Marathi Hindu family as the eldest of four children to director-poet Kumarsen Samarth and his actress wife and filmmaker Shobhna. Kumarsen was one of the early developers of the Films Division of India. Her maternal grandmother Rattan Bai and her aunt Nalini Jaywant were also actors. She grew up with complexes as she was considered too skinny in her childhood. She had two sisters: actress Tanuja and Chatura and a brother Jaideep. Her parents separated before Jaideep&#x27;s birth. Actresses Kajol and Tanishaa Mukerji are Nutan&#x27;s nieces. Her niece Kajol later shared her record for most Filmfare Best Actress wins.

As a child, Nutan went to Villa Theresa School and was later educated at the Baldwin Girls&#x27; High School in Bangalore. While she was attracted to the performing arts since childhood and liked singing and dancing, she liked arithmetic and geography at school. She took lessons in classical music for four years under Jagannath Prasad. In 1953, when her film career had already started, she headed to Switzerland for further studies at La Chatelaine, a finishing school. She was sent there at the behest of her mother following Nutan&#x27;s intensive work in films and major weight loss. She described the one year spent there as the happiest in her life and returned home a year later having gained 22 pounds.

==Career==
===Film debut and early work (1945-1954)===
Nutan first appeared briefly in front of the camera as a child in her father&#x27;s film &quot;Nal Damyanti&quot; in 1945. She started her career at age 14 by playing the protagonist in &quot;Hamari Beti&quot; (1950), directed by her mother. She was conflicted during the making of the film, unsure she could pull it off given how critical she was of her appearance and talents. She took part in Snehal Bhatkar&#x27;s soundtrack for the film, singing the song &quot;Tujhe Kaisa Dulha Bhaaye Re&quot;. The film released to considerable attention for Nutan&#x27;s work. &quot;The Motion Picture Magazine&quot; gave a scathing review of the film but took note of Nutan&#x27;s &quot;fine performance&quot;, which showed &quot;great promise&quot;. She recalled an instance where her relatives changed their mind about her after watching the film: &quot;The relatives who called me ugly changed their opinions overnight. They said they were proud of me.&quot;

Ravindra Dave&#x27;s suspense thriller &quot;Nagina&quot; (1951) followed, and Nutan&#x27;s performance in the film gained her greater recognition. The film became her first commercial success. Aged 15 at the time of its release, she was not allowed to attend its premiere as it was certified &quot;A: (restricted for adults) and she was underage. The social drama &quot;Hum Log&quot;, released the same year, was similarly popular with audiences. Directed by Zia Sarhadi, the film dealt with the trials and tribulations of a middle-class family and starred Nutan as the daughter Paro, an aspiring writer who suffers from tuberculosis. &quot;Nagina&quot; and &quot;Hum Log&quot; consolidated her position as a rising star.

The following year, she participated at the 1952 Femina Miss India contest, where she was crowned Miss Mussoorie, before being sent to Switzerland for further studies due to her weight loss and frail appearance.

===Breakthrough, success and stardom (1955-1979)===
Her first big break was &quot;Seema&quot; (1955), for which she won her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress. She followed her success with a romantic comedy, &quot;Paying Guest&quot;, in which she co-starred with Dev Anand. By the late 1950s she was an established star. In 1959, she starred in two hit films, &quot;Anari&quot; (with Raj Kapoor) and Bimal Roy&#x27;s &quot;Sujata&quot; (with Sunil Dutt), for which she won her second Filmfare Award for Best Actress. In the 1960s and 1970s, she had many more successful films including &quot;Chhalia&quot; (1960), &quot;Saraswatichandra&quot; (1968), &quot;Devi&quot; (1970) and &quot;Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki&quot; (1978).

In 1960, she starred opposite Raj Kapoor once again in Manmohan Desai&#x27;s &quot;Chhalia&quot;, which earned her a Filmfare nomination for Best Actress. In a film review at the time, &quot;Filmfare&quot; wrote: &quot;As the unfortunate girl disowned by her relatives for no fault of hers, Nutan puts over a superb and memorable portrayal.&quot;

She formed a popular screen couple with co-star Dev Anand and the two acted in four films together – &quot;Paying Guest&quot; (1957), &quot;Baarish&quot; (1957), &quot;Manzil&quot; (1960) and &quot;Tere Ghar Ke Samne&quot; (1963).

Bimal Roy&#x27;s socio-realist &quot;Bandini&quot; (1963) is based on &quot;Tamasi&quot;, a Bengali novel by Jarasandha, and stars Nutan as Kalyani, a young prisoner convicted for poisoning the wife of her lover (Ashok Kumar). The story follows her life in prison and how she is later faced with a choice between her past love and a young prison doctor (Dharmendra) who falls in love with her. Having quit acting after marriage, Nutan was persuaded to accept the part by Roy, who asserted that he would abandon the project if she refused. She was pregnant during the making of the film.

&quot;Bandini&quot; was a major critical success, and Nutan received career-best reviews for her portrayal, which is often cited as one of the finest performances of Indian cinema. The film won six awards at the 11th Filmfare Awards, including Best Film and a third Best Actress for Nutan. The Bengal Film Journalists&#x27; Association ranked &quot;Bandini&quot; as the third-best Indian film of the year and acknowledged Nutan with the Best Actress award in its Hindi section. Author and critic Dinesh Raheja wrote: &quot;Sans screaming hysteria-niks, Nutan puts across one of the finest performances seen on Hindi screen. She recognised and was perfectly in tandem with Kalyani&#x27;s innate strength of character.&quot; In 2010, &quot;Filmfare&quot; included her performance in its &quot;80 Iconic Performances&quot; list. Anupama Chopra included the film in her list of &quot;The 20 Best Hindi Films Ever Made&quot;, calling Kalyani &quot;one of Hindi cinema&#x27;s most complex and fully realized female characters&quot;, which was &quot;the role of a lifetime&quot; for Nutan, whose &quot;face raged with a grand passion and a quiet grace&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Forbes India&quot; listed Nutan&#x27;s performance as one of the &quot;25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema&quot;, hailing her work as &quot;the best acting by a lead actress in Indian cinema&quot;.

Her fourth Filmfare win came for &quot;Milan&quot; (1967). She starred opposite Amitabh Bachchan in 1973&#x27;s &quot;Saudagar&quot; (1973), for which she received a sixth Filmfare nomination and a third BFJA award. In 1978, she made an astonishing return to the screen as the righteous Sanjukta Chauhan in &quot;Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki&quot; (1978). For this performance, she received an eighth Filmfare nomination and won her fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actress, at the age of 42. She thus became a record holder in the category, having won five awards for Best Actress at Filmfare. At age 42, she is also the oldest winner of the award. Nutan was perhaps the only actress of her generation to command leading roles in her 40s, with tremendous success.

===Final film roles (1980-1989)===
Following this, she starred in &quot;Saajan Ki Saheli&quot; (1981), as an ignorant, jealous wife to a husband who knowingly befriends the daughter she abandoned at childbirth. In the 1980s, she played roles in blockbuster films such as &quot;Meri Jung&quot; (1985), &quot;Naam&quot; (1986) and &quot;Karma&quot; (1986). &quot;Karma&quot; was notable for being the first time she was paired with actor Dilip Kumar. For &quot;Meri Jung&quot;, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her last film released while she was alive was &quot;Kanoon Apna Apna&quot; in 1989. She died in 1991 of cancer. Two of her films &quot;Naseebwala&quot; (1992) and &quot;Insaniyat&quot; (1994) were released after her death. She also gave a stellar performance as Kaliganj Ki Bahu in the TV serial &quot;Mujrim Hazir&quot;, her only role on the small screen. Nutan also sang two songs, one in &quot;Paying Guest&quot; and the other in &quot;Chhabili&quot;.

==Personal life==
Nutan married Indian Navy&#x27;s Lieutenant-Commander Rajnish Bahl on 11 October 1959. Their only son Mohnish, was born on 14 August 1961, who is an established television and film actor. Her son is married to actress Ekta Sohini. His daughter (Nutan&#x27;s granddaughter) Pranutan Bahl, named after Nutan, is also a film actress. Nutan was fond of hunting. Her husband died from a fire accident in his apartment in 2004.

==Illness and death==
Nutan was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer in 1990. In February 1991, she was admitted to Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai after she fell ill. At that time, she was filming &quot;Garajna&quot; and &quot;Insaniyat&quot;. She died at 12:07 p.m. (IST) on 21 February 1991.

==Artistry and legacy==
Nutan is regarded as one of the greatest actors of Indian cinema. She was noted for her willingness to play unconventional roles and several of her roles were labelled &quot;path-breaking&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Rediff.com&quot; listed her as the third-greatest actress of all-time after Nargis and Smita Patil. In 2012, Nutan was placed 10th by &quot;NDTV&quot; in its &quot;The Most Popular Actress of All Time&quot; list. In 2022, she was placed in &quot;Outlook India&quot;″s 75 Best Bollywood Actresses list. &quot;Times of India&quot;″s placed her in their &quot;50 Beautiful Faces&quot; list. In 2023, journalist Rajeev Masand named her one of Hindi cinema&#x27;s best actresses of all time.

&quot;Filmfare&quot; termed her face &quot;camera-friendly&quot; and said, &quot;Apart from a lissome figure Nutan was gifted with one of the most camera-friendly faces in the industry. One could film her from any angle and it came out perfect.&quot; Actresses such as Sadhana and Smita Patil noted Nutan as their influence. Sadhana was once quoted as saying: &quot;If there was any actress I modeled myself in the lines of it was the versatile Nutan in &quot;Seema&quot;, &quot;Sujata&quot; and &quot;Bandini&quot;. &quot;Parakh&quot; was a film where I really followed Nutan.&quot; Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali said, &quot;They don&#x27;t make actresses like her anymore.&quot; Singer Lata Mangeshkar said that Nutan was an actress who did justice to her voice on screen. 

M.L. Dhawan of &quot;The Tribune&quot; noted, &quot;Nutan fine-tuned her dialogue delivery with an evocative voice. A natural throw was the hallmark of Nutan&#x27;s dialogue delivery. She was low key and mellow as she was peppery and sarcastic and yet made a strong impact. She either played the main part or at least shared equal footing with the male counterpart.&quot; According to Encyclopædia Britannica, Nutan had &quot;developed a natural acting style under Bimal Roy&#x27;s direction.&quot; Arushi Jain of &quot;The Indian Express&quot; stated, &quot;The actor left an indelible mark on the minds of those who had the fortune of watching her on the silver screen.&quot; Shantanu Ray Chaudhuri of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; noted, &quot;Nutan essayed a range of roles that measured up both critically and as a star.&quot; Nutan was known for her nuanced portrayal and for her female characters that stood &quot;shoulder-to-shoulder&quot; with the male characters. Nutan&#x27;s performance in &quot;Bandini&quot; was list in &quot;25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema&quot; by &quot;Forbes&quot;. &quot;Filmfare&quot;″s &quot;80 Iconic Performances&quot; list placed her 49th for the same film.

Nutan&#x27;s narrative is depicted in the book &quot;Nutan – Asen Mi Nasen Mi&quot; (meaning &#x27;whether I will exist or not&#x27;) written by famous Marathi author Lalita Tamhane. Her biography was launched by actress Madhuri Dixit in 2016. In February 2011, a postage stamp, bearing Nutan&#x27;s photo, was released to honour her by the Government of India. On Nutan&#x27;s 81st birthday in 2017, Google commemorated her with a Doodle.

Giving her a tribute, singer Lata Mangeshkar said, &quot;If one has to rank the actresses by their acting prowess, the name of Nutan will be at the top.&quot; Actress Sonam Kapoor recreated the famous Nutan pose from &quot;Saraswatichandra&quot; and termed the actress her &quot;favourite&quot;. Actress Tara Sutaria termed Nutan &quot;fascinating&quot; and said that her generation misses out on Nutan&#x27;s &quot;adaa and nazaaqat&quot;.

<text>The Saskatchewan Act () is an act of the Parliament of Canada which established the new province of Saskatchewan, effective September 1, 1905. Its long title is &quot;An Act to establish and provide for the government of the Province of Saskatchewan&quot;. The act received royal assent on July 20, 1905. The &quot;Saskatchewan Act&quot; is part of the Constitution of Canada.

==Creation==
From 1870 to 1905, the region which is now Saskatchewan was part of the North-West Territories, established by the Parliament of Canada. As the population of the North-West Territories increased, its government evolved from an appointed lieutenant governor in 1876, to responsible government in 1897, to near full provincial powers, with the exception of direct taxation by 1901. However, with the Government of Canada failing to cover the full expenses of the territories, Premier Frederick Haultain requested provincial status for a large swathe of the territories.

The initial proposal by the Conservative Haultain to Liberal Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier in 1900 was seconded by Liberal James Ross, and was taken under consideration by Clifford Sifton, Minister of the Interior. Haultain desired that the entire area between Manitoba and British Columbia be incorporated as a single province, due to the region&#x27;s shared history and economy. Others supported splitting the area into two or more separate provinces based on the existing provisional districts, for fear a single province would be unwieldy, and that it might come to dominate federal politics. The Laurier government postponed any decision until after the 1904 election, during which Haultain actively campaigned for the Conservatives. The Conservatives lost to Laurier&#x27;s Liberals, and following the election, the Liberals decided to create two provinces, Saskatchewan and Alberta.

Two sections in the act as passed caused significant controversy: section 17, which constitutionally entrenched the existing rights of the religious minority in each school district, whether Roman Catholic or Protestant, to establish publicly funded separate schools, with no discrimination in public funding against the separate schools, and section 21, which reserved management of public lands and natural resources to the Government of Canada.

Section 17 was controversial because the issue of religious instruction also paralleled language issues, as Protestants were mainly anglophones, and most francophones were Roman Catholic. English Canadians felt that immigrants should be assimilated into the British culture and language, while French Canadians saw any removal of existing protections as an attack on the French culture. Clifford Sifton resigned rather than support the initial draft of this provision, which he considered to be expanding the rights then in force under the territorial law. A modified version of section 17 was included in the act despite the protests and Sifton&#x27;s resignation.

Section 21 allowed the Government of Canada to retain control over the public lands and natural resources in the new province, unlike the situation in the older provinces, which had control over their public lands and natural resources. While the act provided for monetary transfers to compensate for the lack of resource revenue, this policy hindered the economic growth of the new province and became one of the original sources of western alienation. Haultain formed a protest party, the Provincial Rights Party, based around this issue. The province finally obtained control over natural resources in 1930, with the passage of the &quot;Natural Resources Acts&quot; and the &quot;Constitution Act&quot;, 1930. This issue was again clarified in the &quot;Constitution Act&quot;, 1982.

The &quot;Alberta Act&quot; was passed at the same time as the &quot;Saskatchewan Act&quot;, creating the new province of Alberta. At the time, the two acts were often referred to as the &quot;Autonomy Acts.&quot; The provisions of the two acts are very similar.

<doc id="384197" wikidata="Q1682219" url="?curid=384197" title="Jan Simonsen">
<text>Jan Simonsen (3 March 1953 – 12 August 2019) was a Norwegian politician, writer and journalist. He was a member of parliament from 1989 to 2005, and a member of the Progress Party until he was expelled from the party in 2001. He was the deputy leader of the Democrats party from 2003 to 2004. Since his parliamentary term ended, he largely withdrew from party politics to focus on his writing and journalism. He was a staunch supporter of Israel, and wrote the blog &quot;Frie Ytringer&quot; which focused on the Islamisation of Europe.

==Early and personal life==
Simonsen was born in Stavanger to businesspersons Viktor Holck Simonsen (1913–90) and Martha Espevoll (1917–91). He was born and raised in the city district Våland, and later lived a few years in Eiganes. He studied social science at Rogaland University College and has a minor in history. He was editor for the publications &quot;Strandbuen&quot;, &quot;Video- og TV-guiden&quot; and the official Progress Party publication &quot;Fremskritt&quot;. He was not married.

He was baptised in the Church of Norway, and as an adult remained a strong supporter of the church, but left it during the term of Gunnar Stålsett as bishop of Oslo. This was as Stålsett had been the chairman of the Centre Party in the 1970s, and got his bid for bishop supported by Centre Party MPs in 1998, with Simonsen thinking the choice to have been too politicised. When Stålsett stepped down in 2005, and was succeeded by Ole Christian Kvarme, Simonsen however rejoined the church.

In 2004 Simonsen was a competitor on the reality television show &quot;Robinson VIP&quot;, a Scandinavian adaptation and celebrity edition of &quot;Survivor&quot; that aired in 2005, finishing as runner-up.

==Political career==
Simonsen was during the 1970s active in the nonpartisan youth organisation Moderate Youth, and was the chairman of its Rogaland chapter from 1975 to 1977. He joined Anders Lange&#x27;s Party in 1975, which was renamed the Progress Party in 1977, citing a great admiration of the party founder Anders Lange (who though had died in 1974). Simonsen held numerous positions within the party, including chairman of the Rogaland chapter of the Progress Party&#x27;s Youth from 1978 to 1981 and vice chairman of the Progress Party itself from 1991 to 1993. From 1989 to 2005 he was a member of parliament.

On 19 October 2001, the Progress Party expelled Simonsen from the party after 25 years as a member. The same day, the party&#x27;s secretary general Geir Mo made the statement to the Norwegian news agency NTB that &quot;the Progress Party has, after a complete evaluation, decided that it is best for both parties to leave each other&quot;. Prior to the expulsion, Simonsen had faced scrutiny due to a &quot;Rikets tilstand&quot; documentary on TV 2, alleging that he had used his position as representative to help a friend obtain a liquor license. Simonsen however hold that party chairman Carl I. Hagen misused his position to expel him together with other high-ranking members in 2001 for rather non-existent reasons. He has since had a poor relationship with both Carl I. Hagen and his wife Eli Hagen, though he remained largely on good terms with Progress Party politicians in general, including future leader Siv Jensen.

Since then, Simonsen sat as an independent member of parliament until 2005. From 2003 to 2004, he was vice chairman of the Democrats, a party founded in 2002 largely by other Progress Party members who had been expelled around the same time as Simonsen. He withdrew from the Democrats as a member in 2007. While he was not a member of the Democrats, he however ran as the top candidate for the party in Akershus for the 2009 parliamentary election.

==Political views==
Simonsen was a staunch supporter of Israel and its right to defend itself against terrorism, citing that he as a teenager had read much about the Second World War and the Holocaust, which coincidented with the breakout of the Six-Day War. He however assert that he had friends both on the Israeli and Palestinian side of the conflict. In 2003, he congratulated Israel for the assassination of Ahmed Yassin and Russia for the liquidation of Aslan Maskhadov in 2005. Before the 2009 election, he said that his most important issues was to &quot;fight for our basic democratic, liberal and human society values against external pressure, mainly from Islamic societies&quot;.

==Bibliography==
Simonsen is the author of several books.

<text>TV 2 Direkte (&quot;English: TV 2 Live&quot;) is a Norwegian terrestrial television channel. Its headquarters are located in Bergen. TV 2 began test broadcasting on 13 November 1991, and a year later, it was officially launched on 5 September 1992, becoming Norway&#x27;s first commercial free-to-air television channel. In 1992, TV 2 A/S was admitted as full active member of the European Broadcasting Union.

As is common with television (and cinema) in Norway, most foreign-language shows and segments of local programmes with foreign language dialogues (e.g. interviews with foreigners) are subtitled in Norwegian, not dubbed (with a notable exception being children&#x27;s programmes). Since 2012, TV 2 has been owned by one of its co-founders, the Danish media company Egmont Group.

The channel was renamed from TV 2 to TV 2 Direkte in 2023, in an attempt to differentiate it from their streaming service &quot;TV 2 Play&quot; (not to be confused for the Danish service with the same name). Although &quot;direkte&quot; means &quot;Live&quot;, far from all programming on the channel is actually broadcast live.

The channel was free-to-air on terrestrial TV from its launch date until 1 January 2010, when it became a pay-TV channel. On cable TV and satellite it was &quot;de facto&quot; a pay-TV channel from the start.

== History ==
In 1990, the Storting opened the way for an advertising-financed alternative to NRK to be established. The license was announced on 31 January 1991, with the requirement that no owner could own more than 20 per cent of the shares in the channel. There were many interested parties for the concession, and among others Schibsted, Egmont, Orkla, a grouping around Rolf Wesenlund and Arne Fjørtoft and an investor group called NTN went with plans to apply for the license. The license as won by TV 2 AS in 1991. The company was a consortium owned by Schibsted, Vital Forsikring, Gutenberghus, NTN, Selvaag, Bergens Tidende and Sissel Ditlevsen.

TV 2 had its official start on 5 September 1992 with the show &quot;For første gang&quot; (For the First Time), led by Dan Børge Akerø. The show was a simulcast with NRK, and was seen by 1.7 million viewers.

Normal broadcasts started the following day with the broadcast of an Eliteserien match between Viking and Rosenborg, a concert with the Oslo Gospel Choir in addition to news, sports and a documentary. In addition, the American series Flipper and Et vilt liv had been given a place on the broadcast schedule.

In the first week on the channel, viewers saw premieres of the channel&#x27;s own productions such as VTV, Askeladden and Holmgang, in addition to foreign series such as Cheers, The Naked Gun and A Country Practice.

== TV 2 Direkte HD ==
TV 2 started broadcasting in high-definition on 25 June 2009. Initially, the channel was only available on the terrestrial RiksTV platform. The first programme broadcast in HD was &quot;Allsang på grensen&quot;. Other broadcasts in HD during 2009 include &quot;Tour de France&quot;, Friday and Saturday movies, Sunday night football, &quot;Jakten på kjærligheten&quot;, &quot;Skal vi danse&quot; and American series such as &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Cleaners&quot;, &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, &quot;Modern Family&quot; and &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. TV2 also produces original programming, including the award-winning show &quot;Gylne tider&quot;.

TV 2 Direkte HD is transmitted in 720p50.

<text>Play Misty for Me is a 1971 American psychological thriller film directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, his directorial debut. Jessica Walter and Donna Mills co-star. The screenplay, written by regular Eastwood collaborators Jo Heims and Dean Riesner, follows a radio disc jockey (Eastwood) being stalked by an obsessed female fan (Walter).

The film was a critical and financial success, with Walter earning praise for her first major film role, including a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.

== Plot ==
Dave Garver is a KRML radio disc jockey who broadcasts nightly from a studio in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, often incorporating poetry into his program. After work at his favorite bar, playing a nonsensical game involving corks and bottle caps with the barman, he deliberately attracts the attention of a woman named Evelyn Draper. Dave drives her home, where she reveals that her presence in the bar was not accidental; it was she in fact who sought him out after hearing the bar mentioned on his radio show. He guesses correctly that she is the recurring caller who always requests the jazz standard &quot;Misty&quot;. The two have sex.

A casual relationship begins between Dave and Evelyn. But before long, Evelyn begins to display obsessive behavior and volatile personality traits that alarm Dave. She shows up at Dave&#x27;s house uninvited, follows him to work, and calls to demand that he not leave her alone for a single minute. The final straw comes when a jealous Evelyn disrupts a business meeting, mistaking Dave&#x27;s lunch companion for his date and ruining a major opportunity for his career.

His efforts to gently sever ties with Evelyn lead her to attempt suicide in his home by slashing her wrists. After Dave rejects her again for trying to blackmail him with her injuries, Evelyn breaks into his home and his housekeeper Birdie finds her vandalizing his possessions. Evelyn stabs Birdie (who is hospitalized but survives) and is subsequently committed to a psychiatric hospital.

During Evelyn&#x27;s incarceration, Dave rekindles a relationship with his ex-girlfriend Tobie Williams. A few months later, Evelyn again calls the studio to request &quot;Misty&quot;. She tells Dave that she has been granted parole and is moving to Hawaii for a fresh start in life. She then quotes the Edgar Allan Poe poem &quot;Annabel Lee&quot;. That night, while Dave is asleep, Evelyn sneaks into his house and attempts to kill him with a knife, but he manages to fend her off and she escapes. Dave has a detective, McCallum, tap his phone in case she contacts him again.

Dave tells Tobie about Evelyn and cautions Tobie to stay away from Evelyn until the woman is caught, to which she agrees. Unbeknownst to him, Evelyn has already gained access to Tobie by posing as her new roommate, &quot;Annabel&quot;. Tobie eventually realizes that Annabel is Evelyn when she sees the fresh scars on Evelyn&#x27;s wrists, but before Tobie can escape, Evelyn takes Tobie hostage (she ties up Tobie and gags her). McCallum arrives for a welfare check, and is fatally stabbed with a pair of scissors.

Dave makes the connection between Tobie&#x27;s roommate and the poem. When he calls Tobie to warn her, Evelyn answers and says that she and Tobie are waiting for him. Dave switches from a live show to taped music and rushes to the house, where he finds Tobie gagged and bound hand and foot. As he approaches the trussed-up Tobie, Evelyn attacks him with her knife, slashing Dave multiple times over three assaults in the darkened house. On the third assault, Dave punches Evelyn in the face, knocking her backwards through the glass window and on to the balcony; she falls over a railing and then down onto the rocky shore below, to her death. A wounded Dave returns into the house and unties Tobie, and the two of them leave the house as his voice on the radio show leads into the song &quot;Misty&quot;.

Jazz musicians Johnny Otis, Joe Zawinul, and Cannonball Adderley appear as themselves in scenes shot at the real-life 1970 Monterey Jazz Festival.

== Production ==
The script was originally conceived by Jo Heims, a former model and dancer turned secretary, and was polished by Dean Riesner. The story was acquired by Ross Hunter while at Universal Pictures. It is based on a novel written and published in 1972 by Paul J. Gillette.

Before Malpaso Productions co-founder Irving Leonard died, he and Eastwood discussed a final film, one giving Eastwood the artistic control he desired by making his directorial debut. The film was &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;. Eastwood reflected on his new role:
After seventeen years of bouncing my head against the wall, hanging around sets, maybe influencing certain camera set-ups with my own opinions, watching actors go through all kinds of hell without any help, and working with both good directors and bad ones, I&#x27;m at the point where I&#x27;m ready to make my own pictures. I stored away all the mistakes I made and saved up all the good things I learned, and now I know enough to control my own projects and get what I want out of actors.

The story line was originally set in Los Angeles, but at Eastwood&#x27;s insistence, the film was shot in the more comfortable surroundings of the actual Carmel-by-the-Sea, where he could shoot scenes at the local radio station, bars and restaurants and friends&#x27; houses. The idea of another love interest, with a level-headed girlfriend Tobie added to the plot, was a suggestion by Sonia Chernus, an editor who had been with Eastwood when he was initially spotted for &quot;Rawhide&quot;.

Filming commenced in Monterey, California, in September 1970, and although this was Eastwood&#x27;s debut as film director, Don Siegel stood by to help and also had an acting role in the film as a bartender. Frequent collaborators of Siegel&#x27;s, such as cinematographer Bruce Surtees, editor Carl Pingitore and composer Dee Barton made up part of the filming team.

Additional scenes were shot at the Monterey Jazz Festival in September 1970, featuring jazz greats Johnny Otis, Cannonball Adderley and future Weather Report founder Joe Zawinul. The commentator mentions: &quot;That was the Cannonball Adderley group. They are playing at the Monterey Jazz Festival with Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, Joe Williams, and many others. Now we are gonna hear from &#x27;The Gator Creek Organization&#x27; and &#x27;Feeling Fine&#x27;...&quot;

The Sardine Factory is still at the same location as in the film, at Prescott and Wave Streets, just one block up from Cannery Row in Monterey. The radio station, KRML, was an actual jazz station in Carmel, whose studios were relocated to the Eastwood Building at San Carlos and 5th, in the same building as the Hog&#x27;s Breath Inn (a restaurant that Eastwood owned). After a brief dark period in 2010, the radio station returned to the air in 2011.

The rights to the song &quot;Misty&quot; were obtained after Eastwood saw pianist Erroll Garner perform at the Concord Music Festival in 1970. Eastwood also paid $2,000 for the use of the song &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; by Roberta Flack. Meticulous planning and efficient directorship by Eastwood (which would become one of his trademarks) enabled the film to be made nearly $50,000 short of its $1 million budget, and it was completed four or five days ahead of schedule.
&quot;Variety&quot; reported the budget at $1,242,000. Other sources put the budget at $750,000.

== Release ==
&quot;Play Misty for Me&quot; premiered in October 1971 at the San Francisco Film Festival. It opened in six cities on October 20, 1971 before expanding in November.

=== Box office ===
It was a mild financial success, grossing $10.6 million at the US and Canadian box office. It grossed $133,000 in its first week from six theaters, finishing tenth for the week at the box office in the United States and Canada.

=== Critical response ===
The film has been given mostly positive reviews, with an 85% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 40 reviews. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;A coolly calculating psychological thriller that manages to scare the audience even if it is just using textbook thrills.&quot;

Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;&quot;Play Misty for Me&quot; is not the artistic equal of &quot;Psycho&quot;, but in the business of collecting an audience into the palm of its hand and then squeezing hard, it is supreme.&quot;

Critics such as Jay Cocks in &quot;Time&quot;, Andrew Sarris in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; and Archer Winsten in the &quot;New York Post&quot; all praised Eastwood&#x27;s directorial skills and the film, including his performance in the scenes with Walter.

Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it an &quot;often fascinating suspenser&quot; &quot;when it&#x27;s not serving as an overdone travelog for the Monterey Peninsula&quot;. He also praised the excellent casting.

Observers have noted that Walter&#x27;s performance is consistent with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, such as unstable mood, chaotic interpersonal relationships, highly impulsive behavior, self-harm and intense fear of abandonment.

=== Accolades ===
Jessica Walter was nominated for the 1972 Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Drama.

&quot;Play Misty for Me&quot; was number 26 on Bravo!&#x27;s &quot;30 Even Scarier Movie Moments&quot;.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Play Misty for Me&quot; was released on DVD in many territories. In the United States it was released as a Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD on September 18, 2001. Extra features include a 49-minute documentary titled &quot;&quot;Play it Again: A Look Back at &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;&quot;, a brief featurette of the relationship between Eastwood and Don Siegel, photography montage and &quot;Evolution of a Poster&quot; on the marketing and design of the one sheet. It was first released on Blu-ray Disc on November 10, 2015 by Universal Studios with most of the extra features ported over. The film was released in the United Kingdom on Blu-ray by Final Cut Ent. on July 27, 2020 with all-new alternative special features. It was released on Blu-ray in the U.S. by Kino Lorber studio classics on November 10, 2020 with a 2K master. It includes ported over special features from the previous release and an interview with Donna Mills and audio commentary by film historian Tim Lucas.

== In popular culture ==
In Don Siegel&#x27;s film &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, a cinema marquee that shows the title of &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot; is visible in the beginning of the film, while Inspector Harry Callahan is on his lunch break before the bank robbery which opens the movie.

In &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;, Rose asks Emmett to &quot;play &#x27;Misty&#x27; for me&quot; as she is dragged out of the church while under the influence of tranquilizers.

In &quot;227&quot;″s final season episode, titled &quot;Play Christy for Me&quot;, Lester is stalked by a female listener who repeatedly asks him to play the Hoagy Carmichael song &quot;Stardust&quot;.

In an episode of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, Fez watches &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot; with a date who thinks Evelyn is the film&#x27;s hero.

The film&#x27;s title is parodied in the 2001 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, where there is a mission called &quot;Drive Misty for Me&quot;. The title is also parodied in the name of a quest for the 2017 video game &quot;&quot;, which is &quot;Slay Misties for Me&quot;.

The film is mentioned in Bob Dylan&#x27;s 17 minute epic-ballad &quot;Murder Most Foul&quot;, released in March 2020. Centering around the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Dylan writes a &#x27;stream-of-consciousness&#x27; narrative consisting of many musical, political and cultural references which he &#x27;requests&#x27; from disc-jockey Wolfman Jack. One such request is &quot;Misty&quot;, yielding the film&#x27;s title as part of the final verse.

<text>Interleague play in Major League Baseball refers to regular-season baseball games played between an American League (AL) team and a National League (NL) team. Interleague play was first introduced during the 1997 Major League Baseball season. Before that, matchups between AL teams and NL teams occurred only during spring training, the All-Star Game, other exhibition games (such as the now defunct Hall of Fame Game in Cooperstown, New York), and the World Series. Unlike modern interleague play, none of these contests, except for the World Series, counted toward official team or league records.

From 1997 to 2001, regular season interleague play occurred only on a geographical basis, with divisions in each league (the West, Central, and East) assigned to play their counterpart in the opposite league. In 2002, MLB introduced a system of rotating matchups, allowing interleague, cross-country games to occur in the regular season for the first time. In 2023, MLB began scheduling all 30 teams to play each other every year.

==History==

===Early discussions===
Regular season interleague play was discussed for baseball&#x27;s major leagues as early as 1903, when the two major leagues made peace and formed the National Commission as governing body. The first National Commission Chairman, Cincinnati Reds president August Herrmann (who had already been a proponent of interleague play), proposed an ambitious scheme in late 1904. Herrmann&#x27;s plan would have seen the two leagues ending their seasons earlier, after approximately 116 games, &quot;and then have every National League team play two games in every American League city, and have every American League team play two games in every National League city.&quot; Another interleague play idea was floated around the same time by Boston Americans owner John Taylor, whose plan was for each league to play its full 154-game schedule, to be followed by not just a championship series between the two league winners, but also by series between the two second-place finishers, the two third-place teams, and all other corresponding finishers.

In August 1933, several owners reacted favorably to a proposal by Chicago Cubs president William Veeck to have teams play four interleague games in the middle of the season, beginning in 1934. In December 1956, Major League owners considered a proposal by Cleveland Indians general manager and minority-owner Hank Greenberg to implement limited interleague play beginning in 1958. Under Greenberg&#x27;s proposal, each team would continue to play a 154-game season, with 126 within that team&#x27;s league, and 28 against the eight clubs in the other league. The interleague games would be played immediately following the All-Star Game. Notably, under Greenberg&#x27;s proposal, all results would count in regular season game standings and league statistics. While this proposal was not adopted, the current system shares many elements. Bill Veeck predicted in 1963 that Major League Baseball would someday have interleague play, and in 1968 included it in a proposal for a dramatic realignment of the major league structure. While the concept was again considered in the 1970s, it was not formally approved until 1996, at least in part as an effort to renew the public&#x27;s interest in MLB following the 1994 players&#x27; strike.

===Interleague play introduced===

MLB&#x27;s first regular-season interleague game took place on June 12, 1997, as the Texas Rangers hosted the San Francisco Giants at The Ballpark in Arlington. There were four interleague games on the schedule that night, but the other three were played on the West Coast, so the Giants–Rangers matchup started a few hours earlier than the others. Texas&#x27;s Darren Oliver threw the game&#x27;s first pitch and San Francisco outfielder Glenallen Hill was the first designated hitter used in a regular-season game by a National League team. San Francisco&#x27;s Darryl Hamilton got the first base hit in interleague play, while Stan Javier hit the first home run, leading the Giants to a 4–3 victory over the Rangers.

From 1997 to 2001, teams played against the same division from the other league; for example, the American League West played teams from the National League West, typically scheduled to alternate between home and away in consecutive years. In 2002, however, the league began alternating which divisions played which divisions, and thus in 2002 the American League East played the National League West, the American League Central played the National League East, and the American League West played the National League Central. Matchups which had been of particular interest prior to this format — mainly geographic rivals — were preserved. Corresponding divisions were skipped once when this rotation began, but were put back in the rotation in 2006.

From 2002 to 2012, all interleague games were played prior to the All-Star Game (with the exception of games postponed by weather that were made up after the All-Star Game). Most games were played in June and early July, although beginning in 2005, interleague games were played during one weekend in mid-May.

The designated hitter (DH) rule was originally applied in the same manner as in the World Series (and the All-Star Game prior to the 2010 edition). In an American League ballpark, both teams had the option to use a DH, while in a National League ballpark, both teams&#x27; pitchers were required to bat. Teams from both leagues have both benefited and have been at a disadvantage when it comes to the DH rule in interleague play. For instance, Barry Bonds, who spent his entire career in the National League and actually won eight Gold Gloves earlier in his career, was used strictly as a DH later in his career when the San Francisco Giants played away interleague games due to his poor fielding. Conversely, Boston Red Sox slugger David Ortiz, who spent his entire career in the American League and was the Red Sox&#x27;s regular DH, was assigned to play first base when the Red Sox had away interleague games, with the Sox choosing to give up good fielding in favor of retaining Ortiz&#x27;s power hitting. With the introduction of the DH to the National League in 2022, this no longer applies.

In 2007, two teams – the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Baltimore Orioles – played six games with more than one interleague opponent. The Dodgers played both the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Angels while the Orioles played both the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Washington Nationals. This happened again in 2012 as the New York Yankees played both the New York Mets and the Atlanta Braves for six games. The Miami Marlins also did this, playing both the Tampa Bay Rays and Boston Red Sox for six games each.

The first Civil Rights Game was an exhibition interleague game between the Cleveland Indians and St. Louis Cardinals at AutoZone Park in Memphis on March 31, 2007. The first regular season Civil Rights Game was an interleague game between the Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park on June 20, 2009.

Since the introduction of interleague play, two teams have shifted leagues: the Milwaukee Brewers from the American League to the National League in 1998, and the Houston Astros from the National League to the American League in 2013. As a result, a 2013 interleague series between the two teams made it the first time that two teams faced each other in an interleague series after both teams previously faced each other in an interleague series representing opposite leagues: the two teams met from September 1–3, 1997 (Houston in NL, Milwaukee in AL), then again from June 18–20, 2013 (Houston in AL, Milwaukee in NL). In both instances, the series took place in Houston, with the team representing the American League winning 2–1. From 1998 to 2012, both teams were division opponents in the National League Central (which had six teams at the time, while the American League West only had four).

For the 2020 season, all interleague games featured the DH, as the National League used the rule as an experiment due to health and safety measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The DH became permanent in the NL for the 2022 season.

===Series history===
Interleague play has largely favored the American League in terms of win–loss records. In 27 years of play, the AL has won the season series 19 times, and holds the longest streak of 14 straight seasons, from 2004 through 2017. The National League has won 7 and one season ended in a tie. With the Pirates beating the Royals on September 19, 2018, the National League guaranteed a season series win for the first time since 2003.

As of the end of the 2023 MLB season, the American League holds an all-time series advantage of 3,962–3,690. The American League holds the longest streak for finishing with the better record in interleague play, at 14 straight seasons, dating back from 2004 through 2017. 2006 was the most lopsided season in interleague history, with American League teams posting a 154–98 record against their National League counterparts.

===Interleague statistics===
The following is the text of Major League Baseball&#x27;s policy regarding the compilation of statistics as a result of interleague play:
&quot;For the first time in the history of Major League Baseball, Interleague games are to be played during the regular season. Breaking tradition always brings about controversy and the matter of baseball records is no exception.

&quot;It is the opinion of Major League Baseball that there is no justification for compiling a new volume of records based on Interleague Play. On the contrary, the sovereignty of each league&#x27;s records will be retained, and if a player or a team breaks a record against an Interleague opponent it will be considered a record in that league. In cases where two teams – as Interleague opponents – break a league or Major League record, that record will be annotated with the phrase &#x27;Interleague game.&#x27; Streaks by both teams and individual will continue (or be halted) when playing Interleague opponents in the same manner as if playing against an intraleague opponent. In essence, records will be defined by who made them rather than against whom they were made.&quot;

&quot;The official statistics of both leagues will be kept separately as they have in the past. This means statistics for each team and their individual players will reflect their performance in games within the league and also in Interleague games without differentiation.&quot;

==Geographical matchups and natural rivals==
1997–2001, 2006, 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, 2020, and 2021 saw teams from corresponding leagues (AL East vs NL East, AL Central vs NL Central, and AL West vs NL West) face each other in a series of 2 or 3 games each, although from 1998 to 2012, this was not strictly followed due to unbalanced leagues. Not all matchups were considered interleague rivals, by playing a series of only two or three games, not the four or six-game series exclusive between one NL and one AL team.

Since 1999, certain interleague matchups have been highly anticipated each year, due to the geographic proximity of the teams involved. Many cities, metropolitan areas, and states contain at least one team in each league. From 1999 to 2012, and in 2015, 2018, 2020, and 2021 in which their respective divisions met, there were six games between the two teams annually, three per ballpark. In 2013–2014, 2016–2017, 2019, and 2022, there were four games between the two teams, two per ballpark, as their respective divisions did not meet. With the beginning of league-wide interleague play in 2023, all yearly matchups saw the continuation of the four-game series format for 2023 and 2024 and one three-game series against the other 14 interleague opponents, with location to alternate every year. 

Starting in 2025, these matchups reverted to the six-game series format each season. 

===Permanent rivalries===
* Athletics v. San Francisco Giants — Known as the Bay Bridge Series or Battle of the Bay from 1968 to the end of 2024 when the Oakland Athletics (now relocated to West Sacramento) and the Giants were located in the San Francisco Bay Area. The two teams played in the 1989 World Series as well as the 1905 World Series, 1911 World Series, and 1913 World Series when they were located in Philadelphia and New York, respectively. The interleague rivalry has been played yearly since it began in 1999.
* Arizona Diamondbacks v. Texas Rangers – Paired up as a result of the 2023 schedule format change after meeting as “split rivals” in 2013 and 2019. Previously played as rivals from 1998 to 2000 when the Diamondbacks were an expansion team before the Interleague Lone Star Series was founded. The two teams played in the 2023 World Series.
* Atlanta Braves v. Boston Red Sox – Paired up as a result of the 2023 schedule format change after meeting as “split rivals” in 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022, as well as 1999 to 2002, 2007 and 2009. The Braves played in Boston as the Boston Red Stockings, Red Caps, Beaneaters, Doves, Rustlers, and Braves from 1871 through 1952.
* Baltimore Orioles v. Washington Nationals — Beltway Series, MASN Cup (the teams share the same cable partner), Battle of the Beltways, Parkway Series, or MARC Madness. Introduced in 2006, the Nationals′ second season in Washington, D.C., after their move from Montreal (where they were in a natural rivalry with the Toronto Blue Jays).
* Chicago Cubs v. Chicago White Sox — Windy City Series, Crosstown Classic, or Red Line Series. The two teams played in the 1906 World Series. The two teams would play in an exhibition series yearly from 1903 to 1942 (excluding years either team won their respective pennant). From 1985 until interleague play began in 1997, the two teams would play an annual Windy City Classic charity exhibition game. The interleague rivalry has been ongoing since 1999.
* Cincinnati Reds v. Cleveland Guardians — Ohio Cup. Wade Miley of the Reds threw a no–hitter against the then-Indians on May 7, 2021, making the Reds the first team to no–hit their interleague rival. This was the second no-hitter in an interleague game between teams from the same state, after Don Larsen&#x27;s perfect game in the 1956 World Series. The two teams would play an annual pre-season exhibition game yearly from 1989 to 1996. The regular season rivalry was introduced in 1999 with a hiatus in 2002 and 2003.
* Colorado Rockies v. Houston Astros – Paired up as a result of the 2023 schedule format change after meeting as “split rivals” in 2013 and 2019. Played as division rivals in the NL West in 1993, the Rockies’ inaugural season, before the split to three divisions in 1994 moved the Astros to the newly-formed NL Central division, and played every season as interdivision opponents until the Astros joined the American League in 2013.
* Detroit Tigers v. Pittsburgh Pirates — This series only became a rivalry because the other AL and NL Central teams were already paired up; it has become popular with fans of both teams, possibly due to the rivalry between the NHL&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins. The two teams have several other connections as well. The Tigers&#x27; AA Minor League affiliate, the Erie SeaWolves, located near Pittsburgh, is a former affiliate of the Pirates and has retained the logo of a wolf wearing a pirate bandanna and eye patch. Additionally, Jim Leyland, former manager of both the Pirates (1986–1996) and the Tigers (2005–2013), remains popular in Pittsburgh where he continues to reside. The two teams played in the 1909 World Series. The regular season rivalry has been ongoing since 2012 except for 2020.
* Kansas City Royals v. St. Louis Cardinals — I-70 Series or Show-Me Series and named so because the cities of Kansas City and St. Louis are both in Missouri and connected by Interstate 70. The two teams played in the 1985 World Series. Previously played as interleague rivals in 2002, 2003, and 2006 to 2009, the formal rivalry has been ongoing since 2011.
* Los Angeles Angels v. Los Angeles Dodgers — Freeway Series. The two teams played in a pre-season exhibition series in 1962 to 1964, 1969 to 1971, 1973 to 1979, and 1981 to 1996. The interleague rivalry has been ongoing since 1999.
* Miami Marlins v. Tampa Bay Rays — Citrus Series, the interleague rivalry has been ongoing since 1999 except for a formal rivalry in 2003.
* Milwaukee Brewers v. Minnesota Twins — The Twins and the Brewers were formerly regional rivals in the American League, as well as division rivals from 1970 to 1971, and again from 1994 to 1997. The two metro areas are connected by Interstate 94. However, the term &quot;I-94 Series&quot; is used almost exclusively to refer to the games played between the Milwaukee Brewers and the Chicago Cubs and interleague contests with the also-former-rival Chicago White Sox. The interleague rivalry has been played yearly since it began in 2002.
* New York Mets v. New York Yankees — Subway Series. The two teams would play in an in-season annual exhibition game, the Mayor&#x27;s Trophy Game, 19 times between 1963 and 1983. The two teams played in the 2000 World Series. The addition of the Mets in 1962 brought National League baseball back to New York after the Dodgers and Giants moved to California in 1958. The interleague rivalry has been ongoing since 1999.
* Philadelphia Phillies v. Toronto Blue Jays – Paired up as a result of the 2023 schedule format change after meeting as “split rivals” in 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022, as well as 2009. These two teams played in the 1993 World Series, where Joe Carter hit a walk-off home run during Game 6.
* San Diego Padres v. Seattle Mariners — The two teams were once the only west-coast teams not to be paired up with another interleague rival. The two teams share a Spring Training complex in Peoria, Arizona. Often cited as a counterargument against the &quot;rivalry&quot; series in general due to the teams&#x27; lack of a historical rivalry and their locations on opposite ends of the Pacific Coast (and the I-5 corridor), as well as both teams&#x27; general underachievement throughout their time as &quot;rivals.&quot; Sometimes jokingly referred to as the Vedder Cup after Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder, who has lived in both cities (although Vedder himself, raised in the Chicago area, is a Chicago Cubs fan). The rivalry was introduced in 1999 and was played as a formal rivalry yearly up until 2013 except in 2002 and 2004, with the two meeting as “split rivals” in every season except 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2021, before the rivalry was reinstated as a permanent rivalry due to the 2023 schedule format change.

In 2014, the ten teams that qualified for the postseason were five pairs of geographical rivals: the Angels, Athletics, Orioles, Royals, and Tigers from the AL; and Dodgers, Giants, Nationals, Cardinals, and Pirates from the NL.

====Split rivalries (2013–2022)====
From 2013 to 2022, five teams in each league, two in each East division and three in each West division that had no formal rivalries formed &quot;split rivalries.&quot; While the East divisions see rivalry pairings mostly alternate from year to year, the West divisions have so far seen four different variations of pairings between the six teams that are largely erratic. Starting in 2023, pairings of these teams formed permanent rivals.

In the East:
* 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021:
** Boston Red Sox v. Philadelphia Phillies
** Toronto Blue Jays v. Atlanta Braves
* 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022 (these pairings would later be used from 2023 onward after the scheduling format change):
** Boston Red Sox v. Atlanta Braves
** Toronto Blue Jays v. Philadelphia Phillies

In the West:
* 2013 and 2019 (these pairings would later be used from 2023 onward after the scheduling format change):
** Houston Astros v. Colorado Rockies
** Seattle Mariners v. San Diego Padres
** Texas Rangers v. Arizona Diamondbacks
* 2014, 2016, 2020, and 2022:
** Houston Astros v. Arizona Diamondbacks
** Seattle Mariners v. San Diego Padres
** Texas Rangers v. Colorado Rockies
* 2015, 2017, and 2018:
** Houston Astros v. Arizona Diamondbacks
** Seattle Mariners v. Colorado Rockies
** Texas Rangers v. San Diego Padres
* 2021:
**Houston Astros v. San Diego Padres
**Seattle Mariners v. Arizona Diamondbacks
**Texas Rangers v. Colorado Rockies

===Former interleague rivalries===
* Baltimore Orioles v. Philadelphia Phillies — Played from 1999 to 2005. In 2006, the Washington Nationals replaced the Phillies as the Orioles&#x27; rival. Although the Nationals moved to Washington in 2005, the schedule for that season was already established, so the Washington-Baltimore rivalry series could not start until the next season. Therefore, in 2005 the Orioles played the Phillies as their rival for the last time, while Washington played Montreal&#x27;s planned 2005 schedule, which included what would have been the Expos&#x27;s interleague rivalry games with the Toronto Blue Jays. These two teams also played against each other in the 1983 World Series.
* Houston Astros v. Texas Rangers (Lone Star Series) — Played from 2001 to 2012. In 2013, the Astros moved to the American League West, and the two teams began to play against each other 19 times a year as divisional rivals and then later reduced to 13 in 2023.
* Montreal Expos v. Toronto Blue Jays (Pearson Cup or The All-Canadian Series) — Played from 1999 to 2004 (and by Washington against Toronto in 2005). By the time the Expos moved to Washington, D.C., to become the Washington Nationals for the 2005 season, the 2005 schedule already had been set, so the Nationals played what had been intended as Montreal&#x27;s rivalry series with the Blue Jays that season. In 2006, the Nationals began playing the Baltimore Orioles annually as their interleague rival.

===Temporary interleague rivalries===
* Over the 14 seasons of interleague rivalries when the leagues had unequal teams between 1999 and 2012, several home-and-home series only occurred once for the sake of scheduling and had no geographic basis. These would never occur again as formal interleague rivalries after leagues were balanced in 2013.
** Detroit Tigers v. St. Louis Cardinals in 1999
** Kansas City Royals v. Pittsburgh Pirates in 2000
** Colorado Rockies v. Detroit Tigers in 2003
** Arizona Diamondbacks v. Detroit Tigers in 2005
** Los Angeles Dodgers v. Toronto Blue Jays in 2007 (concurrent with the Freeway Series)
** Boston Red Sox v. Miami Marlins in 2012 (concurrent with the Citrus Series)
* In the shortened 2020 season, the Central divisions&#x27; usual rivalry matchups were altered. The Pittsburgh Pirates played six games against the Cleveland Indians and the Cincinnati Reds played six games against the Detroit Tigers instead of facing off in their usual rivalries, though the Pirates and Tigers still played a 3-game set and the Reds and Indians played a 4-game set.

== Scheduling ==

===1997–1998: Beginnings of interleague play===
1997 was the first year of regular season interleague play. The 20 teams in the East and Central divisions played 15 games each in five three-game series. The eight teams in the West divisions played 16 games each in eight two-game series, playing home and away two-game series against each team.

1998 saw the addition of two expansion teams; with the Milwaukee Brewers&#x27; move to the National League, the leagues were now unequal in size. All the teams in the American League played 16 interleague games, playing one four-game series (split into two home, two away) and four three-game series, except the five teams in the AL Central who played two two-game series and four three-game series. National League teams played between 12 and 16 interleague games.

===1999–2012: Three weeks in June===
From 1999 through 2012, each team in the American League played 18 interleague games a year, but because the National League had two more teams than the American, only four NL teams would play a full 18-game interleague schedule, with the remaining twelve teams playing only 15; occasionally NL teams played only 12 interleague games, allowing for more teams in the league to play a full slate. With the exception of two NL teams playing each other, all teams were involved in interleague play at the same time (typically in June and July), playing only interleague opponents until the interleague schedule was complete for the year. The schedule was later changed to occur only in June; in 2005, it was changed again to allow for more weekend interleague games, with each team playing one series during the third weekend in May and the rest in mid-to-late June (occasionally stretching into early July).

Because of the existence of &quot;natural rivals&quot;, not every matchup was played within each matched pair of divisions; for instance, the Milwaukee Brewers faced only Baltimore and Boston from the AL East in 2003, then met New York, Tampa Bay, and Toronto in 2005.

===2013–2022: Astros join American League===
In 2013, the Houston Astros joined the American League, giving each league 15 teams and thereby necessitating that interleague games be played throughout the season, including on Opening Day and during key division races all the way to the end of the season. This did not require expanding the total number of interleague games, because the probability of an interleague game during the era in which the Astros played in the NL was 252/2430 or about 1 in 9.6 games. With an odd number of teams in each league, one team in each league would be the &quot;odd man out&quot; and have to play an interleague game to fill out the schedule, meaning as few as 1 in 15 games could be interleague (14 AL teams in 7 AL games, 14 NL teams in 7 NL games and 1 AL and 1 NL team in an interleague game). Despite this, there have been proposals to increase interleague play to 30 games or beyond. A smaller increase took place immediately, having every team play 20 interleague games starting 2013.

From 2013 to 2022, each team played 20 interleague games across eight series. Each team played one three-game series against four teams from one division in the other league, and two two-game series (one home, one away) against the remaining team in that division. Divisions had been rotated since 2002 but teams did not necessarily play everyone in that division prior to 2013. The remaining four games were played against a team&#x27;s &quot;natural rival&quot; in home and home two-game series. From 2013 to 2017, these two series were back-to-back at one venue on Monday and Tuesday and at the other team&#x27;s venue that Wednesday and Thursday. Should a team&#x27;s natural rival be a member of the division they are scheduled to play as part of the yearly rotation (this first occurred for all teams in 2015), the team would play home-and-home three-game series against the natural rival, home-and-home two-game series against two other opponents, and single three-game series against the last two (one home, one away). Because the requirement for nearly daily interleague play (the only exception being if not all teams are playing) spreads out interleague play throughout the year, not every team will be in interleague play on the same day. Due to the 2016 CBA lengthening the schedule by four days, 2018 was the first year during which no team was required to play back-to-back home-and-home two-game series against any other team.

In 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic the schedule was shortened from 162 games to 60 and interleague opponents were switched to the corresponding divisions. The teams played 20 interleague games using the same format that was in place in 2015 and 2018, when the same geographic divisions were aligned together for interleague play. In 2020 only, the Central&#x27;s &quot;natural rivals&quot; were altered to include Cleveland v. Pittsburgh and Detroit v. Cincinnati instead of the usual Cleveland v. Cincinnati and Detroit v. Pittsburgh.

===2023–present: Expanded interleague play===
As part of the Collective Bargaining Agreement signed in 2022, interleague play was expanded from 20 to 46 games per team per season, starting in 2023, for a total of 690 interleague games per season. Each team will play a four-game series in a home-and-home format (2 games at each team&#x27;s park), against its natural rival and a single three-game series against the other 14 interleague opponents, with the venue alternating every year. Teams that were part of the “split rivalry” rotation from 2013 to 2022 had permanent rivalry matchups assigned to them.

In 2025, this will expand further to 48 games per team as interleague rivals will revert to the 6 game matchups between rivals that were played from 1999 to 2012, and in 2015, 2018, 2020, and 2021, for a total of 720 interleague games per season.

Most days, there will be either one, three, or five interleague games scheduled, as an average of around 3.8 interleague games are played per day. With 15 teams in each league, the number of interleague games is almost always odd, with exceptions based on when teams from each of the AL and NL have the same off day. Doubleheaders and make-up games also apply should a rainout or other extended delay requires one or more games to be postponed.

===Other===
On April 1, 2013, an interleague game was played on Opening Day for the first time, between the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park, with the Angels winning that game, 3–1, in 13 innings. Also, on September 29, 2013, for the first time in major league baseball history, an interleague game was played on the last day of the regular season, between the Miami Marlins and the Detroit Tigers at Marlins Park. The Marlins not only claimed the distinction of winning that game, 1–0, in walk-off fashion, but also saw their pitcher Henderson Álvarez (who was in the on-deck circle when the walk-off happened) pitch a no-hitter, marking just the 7th time a no-hitter was tossed in an interleague contest.

On April 3, 2016, for the first time in MLB history, the previous year&#x27;s World Series participants faced off on Opening Day the following year. The Kansas City Royals hosted the New York Mets at Kauffman Stadium in a nationally televised game and won, 4–3.

With the Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; victory over the Oakland Athletics on July 10, 2013, every team has beaten every other team at least once; the A&#x27;s had previously been 11–0 all time against the Pirates.

Every team has also hosted and visited every other team at least once. This distinction was completed in July 2016 when the San Diego Padres made their first trip to Toronto. The two teams had previously played in San Diego in 2004, 2010, and 2013.

Every team has won a game in every active ballpark (as of August 31, 2024). The last distinctions occurred in 2024 when the Rockies got their first win in Toronto and the Cardinals got their first win at the current Yankee Stadium. 

From 1997 to 2001, the divisions were paired with their geographical counterpart (AL East vs. NL East, AL Central vs. NL Central, AL West vs. NL West). Beginning in 2002, the divisional pairings rotated. The geographical counterparts were initially skipped in 2004, but returned to the schedule in 2006, creating a three-year rotation that remained in use for over a decade. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the originally scheduled matchups were adjusted in order to limit travel. Divisional pairings before 2023 were:

Since 2023 with the 2022 collective bargaining agreement, every team will play every other team regardless of league. The current format has a total of 48 interleague games per season (46 in 2023 and 2024), consisting of a six-game home and home series against the geographic rival (four games in 2023 and 2024) and a single three-game series against the other 14 interleague opponents, with location to alternate every year.

==Arguments==

Since its introduction, regular-season interleague play has continued to be a source of controversy among baseball fans and others involved with the sport. Among the arguments used in favor of and in opposition to interleague play are the following:

===Pros===
* Interleague play increases attendance; however, these numbers may be skewed, as interleague games were previously primarily played on weekends in June, when attendance is higher across the board, school is not in session and temperatures are higher than some of the other months of the season. However, season-long interleague play should mitigate this statistical bias.
* Fans can see players they might not otherwise get to see, especially those who have only ever played in one league.
* Certain geographic rivalries are played out during the regular season that otherwise might not happen for years at a time. The Yankees now play four games against the Mets each season, whereas they would only have gone head-to-head in the 2000 World Series if not for interleague play. From 1962 until interleague play, the Mets and the Yankees had only played each other in the Mayor&#x27;s Trophy Game (held from 1963 to 1983), which was an exhibition game even though it was played during the regular season.
* It creates matchups that might not have been seen in generations. For example:
** During the 2004 season, the Giants and Red Sox played each other for the first time since meeting in the 1912 World Series.
** The Red Sox had never played at Wrigley Field (an NL park since 1916) until 2005. Conversely, the Chicago Cubs&#x27; trip to Fenway Park in 2011 was their first appearance there since the teams met in the 1918 World Series. The Cubs played their home games in that series in the more expansive Comiskey Park.
** In 2004, the Yankees and Dodgers met for the first time since the 1981 World Series at Dodger Stadium. They didn&#x27;t meet at the Bronx until 2013, making the Dodgers the only team to never have played a regular season game at the original Yankee Stadium.
** In 2008, the New York Yankees visited the Pittsburgh Pirates for the first time since the 1960 World Series.
* It allows for a rematch of the previous World Series. Starting 2023, this is guaranteed to happen once per year as all 30 teams will play each other. The most notable example of this before 2023 came in 2016, when the New York Mets and Kansas City Royals, who met in the 2015 World Series, met again on Opening Day in Kansas City. 
* It allows the relative strength of the two leagues to be measured against each other over a large assortment of games, rather than just in the World Series once per year.

===Cons===
* The World Series and All-Star Game lose the prestige that used to result from the two leagues playing completely exclusive schedules during the regular season: in the case of the World Series, the &quot;best in the American League&quot; playing the &quot;best in the National League&quot; for the only time that season.
* More games against interleague opponents means fewer games against same-league and division rivals – the latter of which may be more compelling. However, the leagues currently play an unbalanced schedule that favors divisional opponents rather than teams from other divisions (which is important due to the postseason qualifying structure – only the best team from a given division is guaranteed a berth in the postseason).
** Starting in 2023, divisional games were reduced from 19 to 13 per season, while every team plays three games against every interleague opponent except for four against their geographic rival. These changes were intended to address strength-of-schedule disparities that could potentially skew a wild card race, with playoffs expanded to six teams per league.

===Former cons===
* These cons applied primarily to the 1997–2001 and/or 2002–2012 formats and not necessarily to the current format:
** The &quot;rivalry&quot; series that consisted of six games a year for some teams lead to further scheduling inequities. For example, the AL West race could be skewed by Seattle getting six games per year against last-place San Diego and Oakland&#x27;s six matchups against defending champion San Francisco.
** Some teams played a certain inter-league team more than a certain intra-league team. For example, the Washington Nationals played the Baltimore Orioles (an AL team) 6 times in the 2012 season, and the San Diego Padres and Pittsburgh Pirates (NL teams) only 5 times each. This is no longer the case since 2013, when every pair of intra-league foes are guaranteed at least six meetings against each other, three at each venue.
** Most notably, teams no longer play identical opponents as their divisional rivals, and even where they do, they don&#x27;t always play them an identical number of times. This can lead to &quot;strength of schedule&quot; disparities like those the NFL has to deal with on a yearly basis. 
*** For example, in 2005, the San Diego Padres played every AL Central team except for Kansas City, who had the worst record in the league, as well as six games against Seattle, who finished that season 69–93. Meanwhile, their division rivals, the San Francisco Giants, played every AL Central team except for the Chicago White Sox, who had the best record in the AL and went on to win the World Series, in addition to six against Oakland, who was in playoff contention for most of the season.
* These cons applied before the National League&#x27;s adoption of the designated hitter rule in 2022:
** Some argued that the AL possessed an unfair advantage over the NL because of the designated hitter rule in the AL, citing the overwhelming dominance of the AL in interleague play for more than a decade. When NL teams were on the road, they were forced to find a DH in place of their pitcher, who would normally bat ninth. Sometimes, the NL team would use one of their star hitters as the DH and use a bench player to fill in for the appointed DH, and other times, the NL team would simply use a bench player as the DH and have him bat later. In either case, however, the benefits of using a DH in place of the pitcher were minimal, especially considering that the AL designated hitters saw more action in their positions and that AL teams still possessed their full 9-man batting lineup. Even when the NL team hosted, arguments were made that there was no real benefit for the NL team either. For the most part, designated hitters are also passable fielders, meaning that they can still be used in the game. And even though the AL team had to take a player out of their lineup, it left them with a starting player available to pinch-hit and/or come in as a substitute player later in the game, as opposed to a bench player on an NL team. And although AL pitchers saw less action than NL pitchers, stats showed that AL pitcher batting average was not much lower than NL pitcher batting average, in large part due to the fact that several AL pitchers previously played in the NL.
** Most American League pitchers were unaccustomed to running the bases (unless they had previously played in the National League), which could lead to injury and premature fatigue. (For example, Chien-Ming Wang of the New York Yankees suffered a season-ending lisfranc sprain on his right foot when running the bases during an interleague game against the Houston Astros in 2008.)

<doc id="384213" wikidata="Q7913022" url="?curid=384213" title="Vampire pumpkins and watermelons">
<text>Vampire pumpkins and watermelons are a folk legend from the Balkans, in southeastern Europe, described by ethnologist Tatomir Vukanović. The story is associated with the Romani people of the region, from whom much of traditional vampire folklore originated.

The belief in vampire fruit is similar to the belief that any inanimate object left outside during the night of a full moon will become a vampire. One of the main indications that a pumpkin or melon is about to undergo a vampiric transformation (or has just completed one) is said to be the appearance of a drop of blood on its skin.

The only known reference in scholarship is Tatomir Vukanović&#x27;s account of his journeys in Serbia from 1933 to 1948. He wrote several years later:

The majority of Vukanović&#x27;s article discusses human vampires; vampiric agricultural tools are also mentioned.The &quot;Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society&quot; has many articles that are collections of Roma tales, presumably oral history. However others are horror stories that allegedly include the direct involvement of the source (e.g., the fatal consequences of disrespecting the dead).

The story was popularized by Terry Pratchett&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot;, a comic fantasy novel making extensive use of vampire legends. Pratchett has stated that he did not invent the vampire watermelon story himself. It is found in several other works: Jan Perkowski&#x27;s 1976 book reprinted Vukanović&#x27;s account, and the webcomic &quot;Digger&quot; incorporates a field of vampire squash (most of which resemble butternut squashes in appearance).

<text>The Churches of Christ, also commonly known as the Church of Christ, is a loose association of autonomous Christian congregations located around the world. Typically, their distinguishing beliefs are that of the necessity of baptism for salvation and the prohibition of musical instruments in worship. Many such congregations identify themselves as being nondenominational. The Churches of Christ arose in the United States from the Restoration Movement of 19th-century Christians who declared independence from denominations and traditional creeds. They sought &quot;the unification of all Christians in a single body patterned after the original church described in the New Testament.&quot;

==Overview==
Modern Churches of Christ have their historical roots in the Restoration Movement, which was a convergence of Christians across denominational lines in search of a return to an original &quot;pre-denominational&quot; form of Christianity. Participants in this movement sought to base their doctrine and practice on the Bible alone, rather than recognizing the traditional councils and denominational hierarchies that had come to define Christianity since the first century A.D. Members of the Churches of Christ believe that Jesus founded only one church, that the current divisions among Christians do not express God&#x27;s will, and that the only basis for restoring Christian unity is the Bible. They simply identify themselves as &quot;Christians&quot;, without using any other forms of religious or denominational identification. They aspire to be the New Testament church as established by Christ.

Churches of Christ generally share the following theological beliefs and practices:

* Autonomous, congregational church organization without denominational oversight;
* Refusal to hold to any formal creeds or informal &quot;doctrinal statements&quot; or &quot;statements of faith&quot;, stating instead a reliance on the Bible alone for doctrine and practice;
* Local governance by a plurality of male elders;
* Baptism by immersion of consenting believers in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit for the forgiveness of sins;
* Weekly observance of the Lord&#x27;s Supper on Sunday
**In British congregations, the term &quot;breaking of bread&quot; is commonly used.
**In American congregations, the terms &quot;Communion&quot; or &quot;body and blood&quot; are used.
**Churches of Christ typically offer open communion on the first day of each week, offering the bread and fruit of the vine to all present at each person&#x27;s self-examination.
* Practice of &quot;a cappella&quot; singing is the norm in worship, based on New Testament passages teaching to sing for worship, with no mention of instrumental music (and also that worship in church assemblies for centuries in the early Church practiced a cappella singing).

In keeping with their history, the Churches of Christ claim the New Testament as their sole rule of faith and practice in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure. They view the Old Testament as divinely inspired and historically accurate, but they do not consider its laws to be binding under the New Covenant in Christ (unless they are repeated in the New Testament) (Hebrews 8: 7–13). They believe that the New Testament demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (and thus a part of the universal Church of Christ) and how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.

===Demographics===
In 2022, the total membership of Churches of Christ is estimated to be between 1,700,000 and 2,000,000, with over 40,000 individual congregations worldwide. In the United States, there are approximately 1,087,559 members and 11,776 congregations. Overall U.S. membership was approximately 1.3 million in 1990 and 1.3 million in 2008. Estimates of the proportion of the US adult population associated with the Churches of Christ vary from 0.8% to 1.5%. Approximately 1,240 congregations, with 172,000 members, are predominantly African-American; 240 congregations with 10,000 members are Spanish-speaking. The average congregation size is approximately 100 members, with larger congregations reporting over 1,000 members. In 2000, the Churches of Christ were the 12th largest religious group in the U.S. based on the number of members, but the 4th largest in number of congregations.

Within the U.S., membership in the Churches of Christ has declined by approximately 12% over the period from 1980 through 2007. The current retention rate of young adults graduating from high school appears to be approximately 60%. Membership is concentrated, with 70% of the U.S. membership, in thirteen states. Churches of Christ had a presence in 2,429 counties, placing them fifth behind the United Methodist Church, Catholic Church, Southern Baptist Convention and Assemblies of God – but the average number of adherents per county was approximately 677. The divorce rate was 6.9%, much lower than national averages.

==Name==
&quot;Church of Christ&quot; is the most common name used by this group. In keeping with their focus of not being a denomination, using Ephesians 1:22–23 as reference to the church being the body of Christ and a body cannot be divided, congregations have identified themselves primarily as community churches and secondarily as Churches of Christ. A much earlier tradition is to identify a congregation as &quot;the church&quot; at a particular location, with no other description or qualifiers. A primary motivation behind the name is the desire to use a scriptural or Biblical name – to identify the church using a name that is found in the New Testament. Adherents are also referred to as Campbellites by academics and other denominations because it is assumed that they are followers of the teachings of Alexander Campbell, similar to Lutherans or Calvinists. Campbell himself refuted the idea that a denomination was started by him or that he was the head of one in &quot;The Christian Baptist&quot; publication in 1826 and 1828, stating: &quot;Some religious editors in Kentucky call those who are desirous of seeing the ancient order of things restored, &#x27;the Restorationers&#x27;, &#x27;the Campbellites&#x27;... This may go well with some; but all who fear God and keep his commands will pity and deplore the weakness and folly of those who either think to convince or to persuade by such means&quot; (&quot;The Christian Baptist&quot;, Vol. IV, 88–89) and: &quot;It is a nickname of reproach invented and adopted by those whose views, feelings and desires are all sectarian – who cannot conceive of Christianity in any other light than an ISM&quot; (&quot;The Christian Baptist&quot;, Vol. V, 270). He was also associated with the Baptist denomination until 1820. The term &quot;Campbellite&quot; is usually offensive to members of the churches of Christ because members claim no allegiance to anyone except Jesus Christ and teach only what is presented in biblical texts.

Alexander Campbell said the &quot;calling of Bible things by Bible names&quot; was important in the reformation. This became an early slogan of the Restorationist Movement. These congregations generally avoid names that associate the church with a particular man (other than Christ) or a particular doctrine or theological point of view (e.g., Lutheran, Wesleyan, Reformed). They believe that Christ established only one church, and that the use of denominational names serves to foster division among Christians. Thomas Campbell expressed an ideal of unity in his &quot;Declaration and Address&quot;: &quot;The church of Jesus Christ on earth is essentially, intentionally, and constitutionally one.&quot; This statement essentially echoes the words of Jesus Christ in John 17:21, 23.

Other terms are derived from their use in the New Testament: &quot;church of God&quot;, &quot;church of the Lord&quot;, &quot;churches of Christ&quot;, &quot;church of the first-born&quot;, &quot;church of the living God&quot;, &quot;the house of God&quot;, and &quot;the people of God&quot;, while terms recognized as scriptural, such as Church of God, are avoided to prevent confusion or identification with other groups that use those designations. As a practical matter, use of a common term is seen as a way to help individual Christians find congregations with a similar approach to the scriptures. Members understand that a scriptural name can be used in a &quot;denominational&quot; or &quot;sectarian&quot; way. Using the term &quot;Church of Christ&quot; exclusively has been criticized as identifying a denomination. Many congregations and individuals do not capitalize the word &quot;church&quot; in the phrases &quot;church of Christ&quot; and &quot;churches of Christ&quot;. This is based on the understanding that the term &quot;church of Christ&quot; is used in the New Testament as a descriptive phrase, indicating that the church belongs to Christ, rather than as a proper name.

==Church organization==

===Congregational autonomy and leadership===
Church government is congregational rather than denominational. Churches of Christ purposefully have no central headquarters, councils, or other organizational structure above the local church level. Rather, the independent congregations are a network with each congregation participating at its own discretion in various means of service and fellowship with other congregations (see Sponsoring church (Churches of Christ)). Churches of Christ are linked by their shared commitment to Biblical restoration principles. Congregations which do not participate with other church congregations and which refuse to pool resources in order to support outside causes (such as mission work, orphanages, Bible colleges, etc.) are sometimes called &quot;non-institutional&quot;.

Congregations are generally overseen by a plurality of elders who are sometimes assisted in the administration of various works by deacons. Elders are generally seen as responsible for the spiritual welfare of the congregation, while deacons are seen as responsible for the non-spiritual needs of the church. Deacons serve under the supervision of the elders, and are often assigned to specific ministries. Successful service as a deacon is often seen as preparation for the eldership. Elders and deacons are appointed by the congregation based on the qualifications found in and , including that the persons must be male (female elders and deaconesses are not recognized, as these are not found in Scripture). Congregations look for elders who have a mature enough understanding of scripture to enable them to supervise the minister and to teach, as well as to perform &quot;governance&quot; functions. In the absence of willing men who meet these qualifications, congregations are sometimes overseen by the congregation&#x27;s men in general.

While the early Restoration Movement had a tradition of itinerant preachers rather than &quot;located Preachers&quot;, during the 20th century a long-term, formally trained congregational minister became the norm among Churches of Christ. Ministers are understood to serve under the oversight of the elders and may or may not also be qualified as an elder. While the presence of a long-term professional minister has sometimes created &quot;significant &quot;de facto&quot; ministerial authority&quot; and led to conflict between the minister and the elders, the eldership has remained the &quot;ultimate locus of authority in the congregation&quot;. There is, however, a small segment of Churches of Christ who oppose the &quot;located minister&quot; concept (see below).

Churches of Christ hold to the priesthood of all believers. No special titles are used for preachers or ministers that would identify them as &quot;clergy&quot;. Many ministers have undergraduate or graduate education in religion, or specific training in preaching through a non-college school of preaching. Churches of Christ emphasize that there is no distinction between &quot;clergy&quot; and &quot;laity&quot; and that every member has a gift and a role to play in accomplishing the work of the church.

===Variations within Churches of Christ===
While there is an identifiable mainstream within the Churches of Christ, there are also significant variations within the fellowship. The approach taken to restoring the New Testament church has focused on &quot;methods and procedures&quot; such as church organization, the form of worship, and how the church should function. As a result, most divisions among Churches of Christ have been the result of &quot;methodological&quot; disputes. These are meaningful to members of this movement because of the seriousness with which they take the goal of &quot;restoring the form and structure of the primitive church&quot;.

Three-quarters of the congregations and 87% of the membership are described by &quot;The Encyclopedia of the Stone–Campbell Movement&quot; as &quot;mainstream&quot;, sharing a general consensus on practice and theology.

Congregational a cappella music from hymnals (perhaps pitched from a pitch pipe), but directed by any capable song-leader motioning the time signature, is notably characteristic of the Churches of Christ. Few congregations clap hands or use musical instruments during &quot;formal&quot; weekly convocations.

The remaining congregations may be grouped into four categories which generally differ from the mainstream consensus in specific practices, rather than in theological perspectives, and tend to have smaller congregations on average.

The largest of these four categories is the &quot;non-institutional&quot; Churches of Christ. This group is notable for opposing congregational support of institutions such as orphanages and Bible colleges. Similarly, non-institutional congregations also oppose the use of church facilities for non-church activities (such as fellowship dinners or recreation); as such, they oppose the construction of &quot;fellowship halls&quot;, gymnasiums, and similar structures. In both cases, opposition is based on the belief that support of institutions and non-church activities are not proper functions of the local congregation. Approximately 2,055 congregations fall into this category.

The remaining three groups, whose congregations are generally considerably smaller than those of the mainstream or non-institutional groups, also oppose institutional support as well as &quot;fellowship halls&quot; and similar structures (for the same reasons as the non-institutional groups), but differ by other beliefs and practices (the groups often overlap, but in all cases hold to more conservative views than even the non-institutional groups):

*One group opposes separate &quot;Sunday School&quot; classes for children or gender-separated (the groups thus meet only as a whole assembly in one area); this group consists of approximately 1,100 congregations. The no Sunday School group generally overlaps with the &quot;one-cup&quot; group and may overlap with the &quot;mutual edification&quot; group as defined below.
*Another group opposes the use of multiple communion cups (the term &quot;one-cup&quot; is often used, sometimes pejoratively as &quot;one-cuppers&quot;, to describe this group); there are approximately 550 congregations in this group. Congregations in this group differ as to whether &quot;the wine&quot; should be fermented or unfermented, whether the cup can be refilled if during the service it runs dry (or even if it is accidentally spilled), and whether &quot;the bread&quot; can be broken ahead of time or must be broken by the individual participant during Lord&#x27;s Supper time.
*The last and smallest group &quot;emphasize[s] mutual edification by various leaders in the churches and oppose[s] one person doing most of the preaching&quot; (the term &quot;mutual edification&quot; is often used to describe this group); there are approximately 130 congregations in this grouping.

==Beliefs==

Churches of Christ seek to practice the principle of the Bible being the only source to find doctrine (known elsewhere as &quot;sola scriptura&quot;). The Bible is generally regarded as inspired and inerrant. Churches of Christ generally see the Bible as historically accurate and literal, unless scriptural context obviously indicates otherwise. Regarding church practices, worship, and doctrine, there is great liberty from congregation to congregation in interpreting what is biblically permissible, as congregations are not controlled by a denominational hierarchy. Their approach to the Bible is driven by the &quot;assumption that the Bible is sufficiently plain and simple to render its message obvious to any sincere believer&quot;. Related to this is an assumption that the Bible provides an understandable &quot;blueprint&quot; or &quot;constitution&quot; for the church.

Historically, three hermeneutic approaches have been used among Churches of Christ.
* Analysis of commands, examples, and necessary inferences;
* Dispensational analysis distinguishing between Patriarchal, Mosaic and Christian dispensations (however, Churches of Christ are amillennial and generally hold preterist views); and
* Grammatico-historical analysis.

The relative importance given to each of these three strategies has varied over time and between different contexts. The general impression in the current Churches of Christ is that the group&#x27;s hermeneutics are entirely based on the command, example, inference approach. In practice, interpretation has been deductive, and heavily influenced by the group&#x27;s central commitment to ecclesiology and soteriology. Inductive reasoning has been used as well, as when all of the conversion accounts from the book of Acts are collated and analyzed to determine the steps necessary for salvation. One student of the movement summarized the traditional approach this way: &quot;In most of their theologizing, however, my impression is that spokespersons in the Churches of Christ reason from Scripture in a deductive manner, arguing from one premise or hypothesis to another so as to arrive at a conclusion. In this regard the approach is much like that of science which, in practice moves deductively from one hypothesis to another, rather than in a Baconian inductive manner.&quot; In recent years, changes in the degree of emphasis placed on ecclesiology and soteriology has spurred a reexamination of the traditional hermeneutics among some associated with the Churches of Christ.

A debate arose during the 1980s over the use of the command, example, necessary inference model for identifying the &quot;essentials&quot; of the New Testament faith. Some argued that it fostered legalism, and advocated instead a hermeneutic based on the character of God, Christ and the Holy Spirit. Traditionalists urged the rejection of this &quot;new hermeneutic&quot;. Use of this formula has declined as congregations have shifted to an increased &quot;focus on &#x27;spiritual&#x27; issues like discipleship, servanthood, family and praise&quot;. Relatively greater emphasis has been given to Old Testament studies in congregational Bible classes and at affiliated colleges in recent decades. While it is still not seen as authoritative for Christian worship, church organization, or regulating the Christian&#x27;s life, some have argued that it is theologically authoritative.

Many scholars associated with the Churches of Christ embrace the methods of modern Biblical criticism but not the associated anti-supernaturalistic views. More generally, the classical grammatico-historical method is prevalent, which provides a basis for some openness to alternative approaches to understanding the scriptures.

===Doctrine of salvation (soteriology)===
Churches of Christ are strongly anti-Lutheran and anti-Calvinist in their understanding of salvation and generally present conversion as &quot;obedience to the proclaimed facts of the gospel rather than as the result of an emotional, Spirit-initiated conversion&quot;. Churches of Christ hold the view that humans of accountable age are lost because they have committed sins. These lost souls can be redeemed because Jesus Christ, the Son of God, offered himself as the atoning sacrifice. Children too young to understand right from wrong and make a conscious choice between the two are believed to be innocent of sin. There is no set age for this to occur; it is only when the child learns the difference between right and wrong that they are accountable (). Congregations differ in their interpretation of the age of accountability.

Churches of Christ generally teach that the process of salvation involves the following steps:

# One must be properly taught, and hear ();
# One must believe or have faith (, );
# One must repent, which means turning from one&#x27;s former lifestyle and choosing God&#x27;s ways ();
# One must confess belief that Jesus is the son of God ();
# One must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ (); and
# One must live faithfully as a Christian ().

Beginning in the 1960s, many preachers began placing more emphasis on the role of grace in salvation, instead of focusing exclusively on implementing all of the New Testament commands and examples. This was not an entirely new approach, as others had actively &quot;affirmed a theology of free and unmerited grace&quot;, but it did represent a change of emphasis with grace becoming &quot;a theme that would increasingly define this tradition&quot;.

====Baptism====

Baptism has been recognized as the important initiatory rite throughout the history of the Christian Church, but Christian groups differ over the manner and time in which baptism is administered, the meaning and significance of baptism, its role in salvation, and who is a candidate for baptism.
Baptism in Churches of Christ is performed only by bodily immersion, based on the New Testament&#x27;s use of the Koine Greek verb &quot;βαπτίζω&quot; (baptizō) which is understood to mean to dip, immerse, submerge or plunge. Immersion is seen as more closely conforming to the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus than other modes of baptism. Churches of Christ argue that historically immersion was the mode used in the first century, and that pouring and sprinkling emerged later. Over time these secondary modes came to replace immersion, in the State Churches of Europe. Only those mentally capable of belief and repentance are baptized (e.g., infant baptism is not practiced).

Churches of Christ have historically had the most conservative position on baptism among the various branches of the Restoration Movement, understanding that repentance and baptism by immersion are necessary parts of conversion. The most significant disagreements concerned the extent to which a correct understanding of the role of baptism is necessary for its validity. David Lipscomb argued that if a believer was baptized out of a desire to obey God, the baptism was valid, even if the individual did not fully understand the role baptism plays in salvation. Austin McGary argued that to be valid, the convert must also understand that baptism is for the forgiveness of sins. McGary&#x27;s view became the prevailing one in the early 20th century, but the approach advocated by Lipscomb never totally disappeared. More recently, the rise of the International Churches of Christ, who &quot;reimmersed some who came into their fellowship, even those previously immersed &#x27;for remission of sins&#x27; in a Church of Christ,&quot; has caused some to reexamine the question of rebaptism.

Churches of Christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God &quot;by the merits of Christ&#x27;s blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God&#x27;s kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do.&quot; The term &quot;alien&quot; is used in reference to sinners as in . Members consider baptism a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it &quot;is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God&quot;. While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a &quot;sacrament&quot;, their view of it can legitimately be described as &quot;sacramental&quot;. They see the power of baptism coming from God, who uses baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself, and understand baptism to be an integral part of the conversion process, rather than as only a symbol of conversion. A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as nothing more than a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in the past, it is seen as &quot;the event that places the believer &#x27;into Christ&#x27; where God does the ongoing work of transformation&quot;. There is a minority that downplays the importance of baptism in order to avoid sectarianism, but the broader trend is to &quot;reexamine the richness of the Biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in Christianity&quot;.

Because of the belief that baptism is a necessary part of salvation, some Baptists hold that the Churches of Christ endorse the doctrine of baptismal regeneration. However members of the Churches of Christ reject this, arguing that since faith and repentance are necessary, and that the cleansing of sins is by the blood of Christ through the grace of God, baptism is not an inherently redeeming ritual. One author describes the relationship between faith and baptism this way, &quot;&quot;Faith&quot; is the &quot;reason why&quot; a person is a child of God; &quot;baptism&quot; is the &quot;time at which&quot; one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God&quot; (italics are in the source). Baptism is understood as a confessional expression of faith and repentance, rather than a &quot;work&quot; that earns salvation.

===&quot;A cappella&quot; singing===
 The Churches of Christ generally combine the lack of any historical evidence that the early church used musical instruments in its worship assemblies with the New Testament&#x27;s lack of scriptures authorizing the use of instruments in worship assemblies to conclude that instruments should not be used today in corporate worship. Thus, they have typically practiced &quot;a cappella&quot; music in their worship assemblies.

The tradition of &quot;a cappella&quot; congregational singing in the Churches of Christ is deep rooted and the rich history of the practice stimulated the creation of many hymns in the early 20th century. Notable Churches of Christ hymn writers have included Albert Brumley (&quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot;) and Tillit S. Teddlie (&quot;Worthy Art Thou&quot;). More traditional Church of Christ hymns commonly are in the style of gospel hymnody. The hymnal &quot;Great Songs of the Church&quot;, which was first published in 1921 and has had many subsequent editions, is widely used in Churches of Christ.

Scriptures cited to support the practice of &quot;a cappella&quot; worship include:

* : &quot;And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.&quot;
* : &quot;Therefore I will praise thee among the Gentiles, and sing to thy name&quot;;
* : &quot;... be filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart,&quot;
* : &quot;I will sing with the Spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.&quot;
* : &quot;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts unto God.&quot;
* : &quot;I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.&quot;
* : By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

The use of musical instruments in worship was a divisive topic within the Stone–Campbell Movement from its earliest years, when some adherents opposed the practice on traditional grounds, while others may have relied on &quot;a cappella&quot; simply because they lacked access to musical instruments. Alexander Campbell opposed the use of instruments in worship. As early as 1855, some Restoration Movement churches were using organs or pianos, ultimately leading the Churches of Christ to separate from the groups that condoned instrumental music. However, since the early 2000s, an increasing number of congregations within the Churches of Christ have begun using musical instruments in their worship assemblies. Some of these latter describe themselves as a &quot;Church of Christ (Instrumental)&quot;.

===Other theological tendencies===

Many leaders argue that the Churches of Christ only follow the Bible and have no &quot;theology&quot;. Christian theology as classically understood – the systematic development of the classical doctrinal topics – is relatively recent and rare among this movement. Because Churches of Christ reject all formalized creeds on the basis that they add to or detract from Scripture, they generally reject most conceptual doctrinal positions out of hand. Churches of Christ do tend to elaborate certain &quot;driving motifs&quot;. These are scripture (hermeneutics), the church (ecclesiology) and the &quot;plan of salvation&quot; (soteriology). The importance of theology, understood as teaching or &quot;doctrine&quot;, has been defended on the basis that an understanding of doctrine is necessary to respond intelligently to questions from others, to promote spiritual health, and to draw the believer closer to God.

====Eschatology====
Regarding eschatology (a branch of theology concerned with the final events in the history of the world or of humankind), Churches of Christ are generally amillennial, their originally prevalent postmillennialism (evident in Alexander Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Millennial Harbinger&quot;) having dissipated around the era of the First World War. Before then, many leaders were &quot;moderate historical premillennialists&quot; who did not advocate specific historical interpretations. Churches of Christ have moved away from premillennialism as dispensational millennialism has come more to fore in Protestant evangelical circles. Amillennialism and postmillennialism are the prevailing views today.

Premillennialism was a focus of controversy during the first half of the 20th century. One of the most influential advocates for that point of view was Robert Henry Boll, whose eschatological views came to be most singularly opposed by Foy E. Wallace Jr. By the end of the 20th century, however, the divisions caused by the debate over premillennialism were diminishing, and in the 2000 edition of the directory &quot;Churches of Christ in the United States&quot;, published by Mac Lynn, congregations holding premillennial views were no longer listed separately.

====Work of the Holy Spirit====
During the late 19th century, the prevailing view in the Restoration Movement was that the Holy Spirit currently acts only through the influence of inspired scripture. This rationalist view was associated with Alexander Campbell, who was &quot;greatly affected by what he viewed as the excesses of the emotional camp meetings and revivals of his day&quot;. He believed that the Spirit draws people towards salvation but understood the Spirit to do this &quot;in the same way any person moves another—by persuasion with words and ideas&quot;. This view came to prevail over that of Barton W. Stone, who believed the Spirit had a more direct role in the life of the Christian. Since the early 20th century, many, but not all, among the Churches of Christ have moved away from this &quot;word-only&quot; theory of the operation of the Holy Spirit. As one scholar of the movement puts it, &quot;[f]or better or worse, those who champion the so-called word-only theory no longer have a hold on the minds of the constituency of Churches of Christ. Though relatively few have adopted outright charismatic and third wave views and remained in the body, apparently the spiritual waves have begun to erode that rational rock.&quot; The Churches of Christ hold a cessationist perspective on the gifts of the Spirit.

==== The Trinity ====
Alexander Campbell and Barton W. Stone are recognized as two of the major Reformers of the so-called &quot;Stone–Campbell Movement&quot;. Barton Stone was staunchly non-trinitarian as he elucidates in his, &quot;An Address to the Christian Churches in Kentucky, Tennessee, &amp; Ohio On Several Important Doctrines of Religion.&quot; Alexander Campbell, &quot;rejected the term &#x27;Trinity,&#x27; but Campbell did not reject the theological idea of the tri-unity of the Christian God.&quot; The fact that these two movements merged into one shows that this was not a major point of contention, even if it was a point of disagreement.

====Church history====

The fundamental idea of &quot;restoration&quot; or &quot;Christian Primitivism&quot; is that problems or deficiencies in the church can be corrected by using the primitive church as a &quot;normative model&quot;. The call for restoration is often justified on the basis of a &quot;falling away&quot; that corrupted the original purity of the church. This falling away is identified with the development of Catholicism and denominationalism. New Testament verses that discuss future apostasy () and heresy (e.g., , , ) are understood to predict this falling away. The logic of &quot;restoration&quot; could imply that the &quot;true&quot; church completely disappeared and thus lead towards exclusivism. Another view of restoration is that the &quot;true Church ... has &quot;always&quot; existed by grace and not by human engineering&quot; (italics in the original). In this view the goal is to &quot;help Christians realize the &quot;ideal&quot; of the church in the New Testament – to restore the church &quot;as conceived in the mind of Christ&quot;&quot; (italics in the original). Early Restoration Movement leaders did not believe that the church had ceased to exist, but instead sought to reform and reunite the church. A number of congregations&#x27; web sites explicitly state that the true church never disappeared. The belief in a general falling away is not seen as inconsistent with the idea that a faithful remnant of the church never entirely disappeared. Some have attempted to trace this remnant through the intervening centuries between the New Testament and the beginning of the Restoration Movement in the early 1800s.

One effect of the emphasis placed on the New Testament church is a &quot;sense of historylessness&quot; that sees the intervening history between the 1st century and the modern church as &quot;irrelevant or even abhorrent.&quot; Authors within the brotherhood have recently argued that a greater attention to history can help guide the church through modern-day challenges.

====Contemporary social and political views====
The churches of Christ maintain a significant proportion of political diversity. According to the Pew Research Center in 2016, 50% of adherents of the churches of Christ identify as Republican or lean Republican, 39% identify as Democratic or lean Democratic and 11% have no preference. Despite this, the &quot;Christian Chronicle&quot; says that the vast majority of adherents maintain a conservative view on modern social issues. This is evident when the Research Center questioned adherents&#x27; political ideology. In the survey, 51% identified as &quot;conservative&quot;, 29% identified as &quot;moderate&quot; and just 12% identified as &quot;liberal&quot;, with 8% not knowing. In contemporary society, the vast majority of adherents of the churches of Christ view homosexuality as a sin. They cite Leviticus 18:22 and Romans 1:26–27 for their position. Most don&#x27;t view same-sex attraction as a sin; however, they condemn &quot;acting on same-sex desires&quot;.

==History==

===Early Restoration Movement history===

The Restoration Movement originated with the convergence of several independent efforts to go back to apostolic Christianity. Two were of particular importance to the development of the movement. The first, led by Barton W. Stone, began at Cane Ridge, Kentucky and called themselves simply &quot;Christians&quot;. The second began in western Pennsylvania and was led by Thomas Campbell and his son, Alexander Campbell; they used the name &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot;. Both groups sought to restore the whole Christian church on the pattern set forth in the New Testament, and both believed that creeds kept Christianity divided.

The Campbell movement was characterized by a &quot;systematic and rational reconstruction&quot; of the early church, in contrast to the Stone movement which was characterized by radical freedom and lack of dogma. Despite their differences, the two movements agreed on several critical issues. Both saw restoring the early church as a route to Christian freedom, and both believed that unity among Christians could be achieved by using apostolic Christianity as a model. The commitment of both movements to restoring the early church and to uniting Christians was enough to motivate a union between many in the two movements. While emphasizing that the Bible is the only source to seek doctrine, an acceptance of Christians with diverse opinions was the norm in the quest for truth. &quot;In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, love&quot; was an oft-quoted slogan of the period. The Stone and Campbell movements merged in 1832.

The Restoration Movement began during, and was greatly influenced by, the Second Great Awakening. While the Campbells resisted what they saw as the spiritual manipulation of the camp meetings, the Southern phase of the Awakening &quot;was an important matrix of Barton Stone&#x27;s reform movement&quot; and shaped the evangelistic techniques used by both Stone and the Campbells.

===Christian Churches and Churches of Christ separation===
In 1906, the U.S. Religious Census listed the Christian Churches and the Churches of Christ as separate and distinct groups for the first time. This was the recognition of a division that had been growing for years under the influence of conservatives such as Daniel Sommer, with reports of the division having been published as early as 1883. The most visible distinction between the two groups was the rejection of musical instruments in the Churches of Christ. The controversy over musical instruments began in 1860 with the introduction of organs in some churches. More basic were differences in the underlying approach to Biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, any practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible in the church, and they could find no New Testament documentation of the use of instrumental music in worship. For the Christian Churches, any practices not expressly forbidden could be considered. Another specific source of controversy was the role of missionary societies, the first of which was the American Christian Missionary Society, formed in October 1849. While there was no disagreement over the need for evangelism, many believed that missionary societies were not authorized by scripture and would compromise the autonomy of local congregations. This disagreement became another important factor leading to the separation of the Churches of Christ from the Christian Church. Cultural factors arising from the American Civil War also contributed to the division.


In 1968, at the International Convention of Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ), those Christian Churches that favored a denominational structure, wished to be more ecumenical, and also accepted more of the modern liberal theology of various denominations, adopted a new &quot;provisional design&quot; for their work together, becoming the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Those congregations that chose not to be associated with the new denominational organization continued as undenominational Christian churches and churches of Christ, completing a separation that had begun decades before. The instrumental Christian Churches and Churches of Christ in some cases have both organizational and hermeneutical differences with the Churches of Christ. For example, they have a loosely organized convention and view scriptural silence on an issue more permissively, but they are more closely related to the Churches of Christ in their theology and ecclesiology than they are with the Disciples of Christ denomination. Some see divisions in the movement as the result of the tension between the goals of restoration and ecumenism, with the a cappella Churches of Christ and Christian churches and churches of Christ resolving the tension by stressing Bible authority, while the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) resolved the tension by stressing ecumenism.

===Race relations===

Early Restoration Movement leaders varied in their views of slavery, reflecting the range of positions common in the Pre-Civil-War U.S. Barton W. Stone was a strong opponent of slavery, arguing that there was no Biblical justification for the form of slavery then being practiced in the United States and calling for immediate emancipation. Alexander Campbell represented a more &quot;Jeffersonian&quot; opposition to slavery, writing of it as more of a political problem than as a religious or moral one. Having seen Methodists and Baptists divide over the issue of slavery, Campbell argued that scripture regulated slavery rather than prohibited it, and that abolition should not be allowed to become an issue over which Christians would break fellowship with each other. Like the country as a whole, the assumption of white racial superiority was almost universal among those on all sides of the issue, and it was common for congregations to have separate seating for black members.

After the Civil War, black Christians who had been worshiping in mixed-race Restoration Movement congregations formed their own congregations. White members of Restoration Movement congregations shared many of the racial prejudices of the times. Among the Churches of Christ, Marshall Keeble became a prominent African-American evangelist. He estimated that by January 1919 he had &quot;traveled 23,052 miles, preached 1,161 sermons, and baptized 457 converts&quot;.
During the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s the Churches of Christ struggled with changing racial attitudes. Some leaders, such as Foy E. Wallace Jr., and George S. Benson of Harding University railed against racial integration, saying that racial segregation was the Divine Order. Schools and colleges associated with the movement were at the center of the debate. N.B. Hardeman, the president of Freed-Hardeman, was adamant that the black and white races should not mingle, and refused to shake hands with black Christians. Abilene Christian College first admitted black undergraduate students in 1962 (graduate students had been admitted in 1961). Desegregation of other campuses followed.

Efforts to address racism continued through the following decades. A national meeting of prominent leaders from the Churches of Christ was held in June 1968. Thirty-two participants signed a set of proposals intended to address discrimination in local congregations, church affiliated activities and the lives of individual Christians. An important symbolic step was taken in 1999 when the president of Abilene Christian University &quot;confessed the sin of racism in the school&#x27;s past segregationist policies&quot; and asked black Christians for forgiveness during a lectureship at Southwestern Christian College, a historically black school affiliated with the Churches of Christ.

===Institutional controversy===
After World War II, Churches of Christ began sending ministers and humanitarian relief to war-torn Europe and Asia.

Though there was agreement that separate para-church &quot;missionary societies&quot; could not be established (on the belief that such work could only be performed through local congregations), a doctrinal conflict ensued about how this work was to be done. Eventually, the funding and control of outreach programs in the United States such as homes for orphans, nursing homes, mission work, setting up new congregations, Bible colleges or seminaries, and large-scale radio and television programs became part of the controversy.

Congregations which supported and participated in pooling funds for these institutional activities are said to be &quot;sponsoring church&quot; congregations. Congregations which have traditionally opposed these organized sponsorship activities are said to be &quot;non-institutional&quot; congregations. The institutional controversy resulted in the largest division among Churches of Christ in the 20th century.

===Separation of the International Churches of Christ===
The International Churches of Christ had their roots in a &quot;discipling&quot; movement that arose among the mainline Churches of Christ during the 1970s. This discipling movement developed in the campus ministry of Chuck Lucas.

In 1967, Chuck Lucas was minister of the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville, Florida (later renamed the Crossroads Church of Christ). That year he started a new project known as Campus Advance (based on principles borrowed from the Campus Crusade and the Shepherding Movement). Centered on the University of Florida, the program called for a strong evangelical outreach and an intimate religious atmosphere in the form of &quot;soul talks&quot; and &quot;prayer partners. Soul talks&quot; were held in student residences and involved prayer and sharing overseen by a leader who delegated authority over group members. &quot;Prayer partners&quot; referred to the practice of pairing a new Christian with an older guide for personal assistance and direction. Both procedures led to &quot;in-depth involvement of each member in one another&#x27;s lives&quot;, and critics accused Lucas of fostering cultism.

The Crossroads Movement later spread into some other Churches of Christ. One of Lucas&#x27; converts, Kip McKean, moved to the Boston area in 1979 and began working with &quot;would-be disciples&quot; in the Lexington Church of Christ. He asked them to &quot;redefine their commitment to Christ,&quot; and introduced the use of discipling partners. The congregation grew rapidly, and was renamed the Boston Church of Christ. In the early 1980s, the focus of the movement moved to Boston, Massachusetts where Kip McKean and the Boston Church of Christ became prominently associated with the trend. With the national leadership located in Boston, during the 1980s it commonly became known as the &quot;Boston movement&quot;. A formal break was made from the mainline Churches of Christ in 1993 with the organization of the International Churches of Christ. This new designation formalized a division that was already in existence between those involved with the Crossroads/Boston Movement and &quot;mainline&quot; Churches of Christ. Other names that have been used for this movement include the &quot;Crossroads movement&quot;, &quot;Multiplying Ministries&quot;, the &quot;Discipling Movement&quot; and the &quot;Boston Church of Christ&quot;.

Kip McKean resigned as the &quot;World Mission Evangelist&quot; in November 2002. Some ICoC leaders began &quot;tentative efforts&quot; at reconciliation with the Churches of Christ during the Abilene Christian University Lectureship in February 2004.

===Restoration Movement timeline===
==Churches of Christ outside the United States==
Most members of the Churches of Christ live outside the United States. Although there is no reliable counting system, it is anecdotally believed there may be more than 1,000,000 members of the Churches of Christ in Africa, approximately 1,000,000 in India, and 50,000 in Central and South America. Total worldwide membership is over 3,000,000, with approximately 1,000,000 in the U.S.

===Africa===
Although there is no reliable counting system, it is anecdotally believed to be 1,000,000 or more members of the Churches of Christ in Africa. The total number of congregations is approximately 14,000. The most significant concentrations are in Nigeria, Malawi, Ghana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, South Africa, South Sudan and Kenya.

===Asia===
Estimates are that there are 2,000 or more Restoration Movement congregations in India, with a membership of approximately 1,000,000. More than 100 congregations exist in the Philippines. Growth in other Asian countries has been smaller but is still significant.

===Australia===

Historically, Restoration Movement groups from Great Britain were more influential than those from the United States in the early development of the movement in Australia. Churches of Christ grew up independently in several locations. While early Churches of Christ in Australia saw creeds as divisive, towards the end of the 19th century they began viewing &quot;summary statements of belief&quot; as useful in tutoring second generation members and converts from other religious groups. The period from 1875 through 1910 also saw debates over the use of musical instruments in worship, Christian Endeavor Societies and Sunday Schools. Ultimately, all three found general acceptance in the movement. Currently, the Restoration Movement is not as divided in Australia as it is in the United States. There have been strong ties with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), but many conservative ministers and congregations associate with the Christian churches and churches of Christ instead. Others have sought support from non-instrumental Churches of Christ, particularly those who felt that &quot;conference&quot; congregations had &quot;departed from the restoration ideal&quot;.

===Canada===
A relatively small proportion of total membership comes from Canada. A growing portion of the Canadian demographic is made up of immigrant members of the church. This is partly the result of Canadian demographics as a whole, and partly due to decreased interest amongst late generation Canadians. The largest concentration of active congregations in Canada are in Southern Ontario, with notable congregations gathering in Beamsville, Bramalea, Niagara Falls, Vineland, Toronto (several), and Waterloo. However, many congregations of various sizes (typically under 300 members) meet all across Canada.

===Great Britain===

In the early 1800s, Scottish Baptists were influenced by the writings of Alexander Campbell in the &quot;Christian Baptist&quot; and &quot;Millennial Harbinger&quot;. A group in Nottingham withdrew from the Scotch Baptist church in 1836 to form a Church of Christ. James Wallis, a member of that group, founded a magazine named &quot;The British Millennial Harbinger&quot; in 1837. In 1842 the first Cooperative Meeting of Churches of Christ in Great Britain was held in Edinburgh. Approximately 50 congregations were involved, representing a membership of 1,600. The name &quot;Churches of Christ&quot; was formally adopted at an annual meeting in 1870. Alexander Campbell influenced the British Restoration Movement indirectly through his writings; he visited Britain for several months in 1847, and &quot;presided at the Second Cooperative Meeting of the British Churches at Chester&quot;. At that time the movement had grown to encompass 80 congregations with a total membership of 2,300. Annual meetings were held after 1847.

The use of instrumental music in worship was not a source of division among the Churches of Christ in Great Britain before World War I. More significant was the issue of pacifism; a national conference was established in 1916 for congregations that opposed the war. A conference for &quot;Old Paths&quot; congregations was first held in 1924. The issues involved included concern that the Christian Association was compromising traditional principles in seeking ecumenical ties with other organizations and a sense that it had abandoned Scripture as &quot;an all-sufficient rule of faith and practice&quot;. Two &quot;Old Paths&quot; congregations withdrew from the Association in 1931; an additional two withdrew in 1934, and nineteen more withdrew between 1943 and 1947.

Membership declined rapidly during and after the First World War. The Association of Churches of Christ in Britain disbanded in 1980. Most Association congregations (approximately 40) united with the United Reformed Church in 1981. In the same year, twenty-four other congregations formed a Fellowship of Churches of Christ. The Fellowship developed ties with the Christian churches and churches of Christ during the 1980s.

The Fellowship of Churches of Christ and some Australian and New Zealand Churches advocate a &quot;missional&quot; emphasis with an ideal of &quot;Five Fold Leadership&quot;. Many people in more traditional Churches of Christ see these groups as having more in common with Pentecostal churches. The main publishing organs of traditional Churches of Christ in Britain are &quot;The Christian Worker&quot; magazine and the &quot;Scripture Standard&quot; magazine. A history of the Association of Churches of Christ, &quot;Let Sects and Parties Fall&quot;, was written by David M Thompson. Further information can be found in the &quot;Historical Survey of Churches of Christ in the British Isles&quot;, edited by Joe Nisbet.

===South America===
In Brazil there are above 600 congregations and 100,000 members from the Restoration Movement. Most of them were established by Lloyd David Sanders.

<doc id="384225" wikidata="Q212047" url="?curid=384225" title="Sabine's gull">
<text>Sabine&#x27;s gull ( or ) (Xema sabini) is a small gull. It is usually treated as the only species placed in the genus Xema, though some authors include it with other gulls in a wide view of the genus &quot;Larus&quot;. It has also been known historically as fork-tailed gull or &quot;xeme&quot; (from the genus name). It breeds in colonies on arctic coasts and tundra, laying two or three spotted olive-brown eggs in a ground nest lined with grass. Sabine&#x27;s gull is pelagic outside the breeding season. It takes a wide variety of mainly animal food, and will eat any suitable small prey.

==Taxonomy==
Sabine&#x27;s gull was formally described in 1819 by the naturalist Joseph Sabine under the binomial name &quot;Larus sabini&quot;. Sabine based his description on specimens that had been collected by his brother Captain Edward Sabine who had accompanied Captain John Ross&#x27;s on a voyage to look for the Northwest Passage. The birds were found breeding on low-lying islands off the west coast of Greenland in July 1818. Sabine&#x27;s gull is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Xema&quot; that was described in 1819 by the zoologist William Leach in an appendix to Ross&#x27;s account of the voyage. The genus name &quot;Xema&quot; appears to be an invented name without meaning.

Sabine&#x27;s gull is usually treated as comprising a monotypic genus; it is placed within the genus &quot;Larus&quot; only when the genus is enlarged. The yellow-tipped black bill and notched tail are almost unique within the gulls, as they are shared only with the swallow-tailed gull of the Galapagos. On the basis of this the two species were often thought to be each other&#x27;s closest relatives, a hypothesis ruled out by a number of behaviour and ecological differences. Mitochondrial DNA studies confirmed that they are not closely related, and the closest relative of Sabine&#x27;s gull is now thought to be the ivory gull, another Arctic species. The two species are thought to have separated around 6 million years ago, longer ago than most groups of gull species, with this pair splitting from the kittiwakes about 8 million years ago.

Geographical variation is slight; birds from Alaska are slightly darker and perhaps bigger. Most authorities recognise no races, but a few recognise four based on size and mantle (back) colour. The Handbook of the Birds of the World recognises four subspecies. The nominate subspecies, &quot;X. s. sabini&quot;, breeds from the Canadian Arctic to Greenland. &quot;X. s. palaearctica&quot; (Stegman, 1934) breeds from Spitsbergen to the Taymyr Peninsula in Russia, and &quot;X. s. tschuktschorum&quot; (Portenko, 1939) breeds on the Chukotskiy Peninsula of Russia, and &quot;X. s. woznesenskii&quot; (Portenko, 1939) is found from the Gulf of Anadyr to Alaska.

==Description==
Sabine&#x27;s gull is a small gull, in length and weighing . The wings are long, thin and pointed with a span of between . The bill, which is black with a yellow tip, is around long.

This species is easy to identify through its striking wing pattern, though at long range it can be confused with immature black-legged kittiwakes. The adult has a pale grey back and wing coverts, four black outer primary flight feathers, and white inner primaries and secondaries. The white tail is slightly forked. The adult&#x27;s hood darkens during breeding season to dark grey with a narrow black collar at the base of the hood. Young birds have a similar tricoloured wing pattern, but the grey is replaced by brown, and the tail has a black terminal band. Juveniles take two years to attain full adult plumage. Sabine&#x27;s gulls have an unusual moult pattern for gulls. Fledged birds retain their juvenile plumage through the autumn and do not start moulting into their first winter plumage until they have reached their wintering grounds. Adults have their complete moult in the spring prior to the spring migration, and have a partial moult in the autumn after returning to the wintering area, a reversal of the usual pattern for gulls. They have a very high-pitched and squeaking call.

==Distribution and habitat==
Sabine&#x27;s gulls breed in the Arctic, with a near-circumpolar distribution across northernmost North America and Eurasia. They migrate south to the Southern Hemisphere in autumn, covering up to 32,000–39,000 km per year, the longest migration of any gull.

The Svalbard, Greenland and eastern Canadian populations of Sabine&#x27;s gull usually cross the Atlantic Ocean by way of the westernmost coasts of Europe (Ireland, western Great Britain, northwest Spain, Portugal) and northwest Africa (Morocco) to winter off southwestern Africa in the cold waters of the Benguela Current off Namibia and South Africa. During their flight south, the birds spend significant time (typically around 45 days) feeding offshore in the Bay of Biscay. They may also stop at different island chains, such as the Azores and Canary Islands. Occasionally, individual Sabine&#x27;s gulls can be seen on other coastlines, such as the coasts of the North Sea, and in North America in the northeastern United States and Eastern Seaboard, typically following autumn storms. 

Most of the western North American and Siberian populations winters at sea in the southeast Pacific Ocean, heading to islets and outcrops off of the South American west coast from the Galápagos Islands to northern Chile, where a consistent food supply is nourished by the cold waters of the Humboldt Current. Along their migration route, Sabine&#x27;s gulls make stops along the United States West Coast, and the Pacific coasts of Mexico and Central America; they can be observed on the California coast and along the Pacific coast of Baja California and Baja California Sur, Mexico.

Sabine&#x27;s gull is recorded often enough inland, in North America, Europe, and even Siberia, that it has been said to exhibit &quot;cross-continental migration&quot; in addition to migration at sea.

==Diet and feeding==
The diet and feeding preferences of Sabine&#x27;s gull varies by season and habitat. In the breeding season, the gulls pursue a range of freshwater and terrestrial prey on the tundra (and within boreal river deltas, estuaries and coastal wetlands), including both terrestrial and aquatic beetles, springtails, craneflies, mosquitoes, midges, flower flies (Syrphidae), molluscs, insects, arachnids, water bugs, various invertebrate larvae, crustaceans, fish, as well as nestling birds or unhatched eggs. Young chicks and eggs, while generally consumed opportunistically, may include waterfowl, black turnstones and lapland longspurs, as well as other gulls, including Sabine&#x27;s gulls.

<text>A crank is an arm attached at a right angle to a rotating shaft by which circular motion is imparted to or received from the shaft. When combined with a connecting rod, it can be used to convert circular motion into reciprocating motion, or vice versa. The arm may be a bent portion of the shaft, or a separate arm or disk attached to it. Attached to the end of the crank by a pivot is a rod, usually called a connecting rod (conrod).

The term often refers to a human-powered crank which is used to manually turn an axle, as in a bicycle crankset or a brace and bit drill. In this case a person&#x27;s arm or leg serves as the connecting rod, applying reciprocating force to the crank. There is usually a bar perpendicular to the other end of the arm, often with a freely rotatable handle or attached.
== Examples ==


Familiar examples include:

=== Hand-powered cranks ===

* Spinning wheel
* Mechanical pencil sharpener
* Fishing reel and other reels for cables, wires, ropes, etc.
*Starting Handle for older cars
* Manually operated car window
* The carpenter&#x27;s brace is a compound crank.
* The crank set that drives a handcycle through its handles.
* Hand winches
=== Foot-powered cranks ===
* The crankset that drives a bicycle via the pedals.
* Treadle sewing machine

=== Engines ===

Almost all reciprocating engines use cranks (with connecting rods) to transform the back-and-forth motion of the pistons into rotary motion. The cranks are incorporated into a crankshaft.

== History ==

=== Asia ===

==== China ====

It was thought that evidence of the earliest true crank handle was found in a Han era glazed-earthenware tomb model of an agricultural winnowing fan dated no later than 200 AD, but since then a series of similar pottery models with crank operated winnowing fans were unearthed, with one of them dating back to the Western Han dynasty (202 BC – 9 AD). The Chinese used the crank-and-connecting rod in ancient blasting apparatus, textile machinery and agricultural machinery no later than the Western Han dynasty (202 BC – 9 AD). It was first used in the manually operated quern and &quot;long&quot; (grain decortication item) before evolving into other devices. According to F. Lisheng and T. Qingjun, the hand-crank of the rotary quern was different from a crank, which was the combination of a hand-crank and a push-and-pull connecting rod by a hinge. Eventually crank-and-connecting rods were used in the inter-conversion or rotary and reciprocating motion for other applications such as flour-sifting, treadle spinning wheels, water-powered furnace bellows, and silk-reeling machines.

=== Middle East ===
Ancient Egyptians had manual drills resembling a crank at the time of the Old Kingdom (2686–2181 BCE) and even a hieroglyph for the tool. However the Ancient Egyptian drill didn&#x27;t operate as a true crank.

Later evidence for the crank, combined with a connecting rod in a machine, appears in the Ancient Greek Hierapolis sawmill in Roman Asia from the 3rd century AD and two stone sawmills at Gerasa, Roman Syria, and Ephesus, Greek Ionia under Rome, (both 6th century AD). On the pediment of the Hierapolis mill, a waterwheel fed by a mill race is shown powering via a gear train two frame saws which cut rectangular blocks by the way of some kind of connecting rods and, through mechanical necessity, cranks. The accompanying inscription is in Greek. The crank and connecting rod mechanisms of the other two archaeologically attested sawmills worked without a gear train.

The crank appears in the mid-9th century in several of the hydraulic devices described by the Banū Mūsā brothers in their &quot;Book of Ingenious Devices&quot;. These devices, however, made only partial rotations and could not transmit much power, although only a small modification would have been required to convert it to a crankshaft.

Al-Jazari (1136–1206) described a crank and connecting rod system in a rotating machine in two of his water-raising machines. His twin-cylinder pump incorporated a crankshaft. A crank is later also described in an early 15th century Arabic manuscript of Hero of Alexandria&#x27;s &quot;Mechanics&quot;.

=== Europe ===
==== Antiquity ====
The first rotary hand mills, or rotary querns, appeared in Spain (600 BC – 500 BC), before they spread to the East. The handle near the outer edge of the rotary part makes the crank, a human arm powering the rotation would be the connecting rod. According to F. Lisheng and T. Qingjun, the hand-crank of the rotary quern was different from a crank, which was the combination of a hand-crank and a push-and-pull connecting rod by a hinge.

The Antikythera mechanism, dated to around 200 BC, used a crank as a part of its mechanism. The crank was used to manually setup the starting date for a prediction.Later evidence for the crank, combined with a connecting rod in a machine, appears in the Ancient Greek Hierapolis sawmill in Roman Asia from the 3rd century AD and two stone sawmills at Gerasa, Roman Syria, and Ephesus, Greek Ionia under Rome, (both 6th century AD). On the pediment of the Hierapolis mill, a waterwheel fed by a mill race is shown powering via a gear train two frame saws which cut rectangular blocks by the way of some kind of connecting rods and, through mechanical necessity, cranks. The accompanying inscription is in Greek. The crank and connecting rod mechanisms of the other two archaeologically attested sawmills worked without a gear train.

A Roman iron crank of yet unknown purpose dating to the 2nd century AD was excavated in Augusta Raurica, Switzerland. The long piece has fitted to one end a long bronze handle, the other handle being lost.

An true iron crank about long was excavated, along with a pair of shattered mill-stones of diameter and diverse iron items, in Aschheim, close to Munich. The crank-operated Roman mill is dated to the late 2nd century AD. However an often cited modern reconstruction of a bucket-chain pump driven by hand-cranked flywheels from the Nemi ships has been dismissed as &quot;archaeological fantasy&quot;. 

In ancient literature, there is a reference to the workings of water-powered marble saws close to Trier, now Germany, by the late 4th century poet Ausonius; about the same time, these mill types seem also to be indicated by the Greek Christian saint Gregory of Nyssa from Anatolia, demonstrating a diversified use of water-power in many parts of the Roman Empire The three finds push back the date of the invention of the crank and connecting rod by a full millennium:


==== Middle Ages ====

A rotary grindstone − the earliest representation of one − which is operated by a crank handle is shown in the Carolingian manuscript &quot;Utrecht Psalter&quot;; the pen drawing of around 830 goes back to a late antique original. A musical tract ascribed to the abbot Odo of Cluny (−942) describes a fretted stringed instrument which was sounded by a resined wheel turned with a crank; the device later appears in two 12th century illuminated manuscripts. There are also two pictures of Fortuna cranking her wheel of destiny from this and the following century.

The use of crank handles in trepanation drills was depicted in the 1887 edition of the &quot;Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines&quot; and ascribed to the Spanish Muslim surgeon Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi; however, the existence of such a device cannot be confirmed by the original illuminations and thus has to be discounted. The Benedictine monk Theophilus Presbyter (c. 1070−1125) described crank handles &quot;used in the turning of casting cores&quot;.

The Italian physician Guido da Vigevano (c. 1280−1349), planning for a new crusade, made illustrations for a paddle boat and war carriages that were propelled by manually turned compound cranks and gear wheels (center of image). The &quot;Luttrell Psalter&quot;, dating to around 1340, describes a grindstone which was rotated by two cranks, one at each end of its axle; the geared hand-mill, operated either with one or two cranks, appeared later in the 15th century;

Medieval cranes were occasionally powered by cranks, although more often by windlasses.

==== Renaissance ====

The crank became common in Europe by the early 15th century, often seen in the works of those such as the German military engineer Konrad Kyeser. Devices depicted in Kyeser&#x27;s &quot;Bellifortis&quot; include cranked windlasses (instead of spoke-wheels) for spanning siege crossbows, cranked chain of buckets for water-lifting and cranks fitted to a wheel of bells. Kyeser also equipped the Archimedes screws for water-raising with a crank handle, an innovation which subsequently replaced the ancient practice of working the pipe by treading. The earliest evidence for the fitting of a well-hoist with cranks is found in a miniature of c. 1425 in the German &quot;Hausbuch of the Mendel Foundation&quot;.

The first depictions of the compound crank in the carpenter&#x27;s brace appear between 1420 and 1430 in various northern European artwork. The rapid adoption of the compound crank can be traced in the works of the Anonymous of the Hussite Wars, an unknown German engineer writing on the state of the military technology of his day: first, the connecting-rod, applied to cranks, reappeared, second, double compound cranks also began to be equipped with connecting-rods and third, the flywheel was employed for these cranks to get them over the &#x27;dead-spot&#x27;.

One of the drawings of the Anonymous of the Hussite Wars shows a boat with a pair of paddle-wheels at each end turned by men operating compound cranks (see above). The concept was much improved by the Italian engineer and writer Roberto Valturio in 1463, who devised a boat with five sets, where the parallel cranks are all joined to a single power source by one connecting-rod, an idea also taken up by his compatriot Francesco di Giorgio.

In Renaissance Italy, the earliest evidence of a compound crank and connecting-rod is found in the sketch books of Taccola, but the device is still mechanically misunderstood. A sound grasp of the crank motion involved demonstrates a little later Pisanello who painted a piston-pump driven 
by a water-wheel and operated by two simple cranks and two connecting-rods.

The 15th century also saw the introduction of cranked rack-and-pinion devices, called cranequins, which were fitted to the crossbow&#x27;s stock as a means of exerting even more force while spanning the missile weapon (see right). In the textile industry, cranked reels for winding skeins of yarn were introduced.

Around 1480, the early medieval rotary grindstone was improved with a treadle and crank mechanism. Cranks mounted on push-carts first appear in a German engraving of 1589.

From the 16th century onwards, evidence of cranks and connecting rods integrated into machine design becomes abundant in the technological treatises of the period: Agostino Ramelli&#x27;s &quot;The Diverse and Artifactitious Machines&quot; of 1588 alone depicts eighteen examples, a number which rises in the &quot;Theatrum Machinarum Novum&quot; by Georg Andreas Böckler to 45 different machines, one third of the total.

=== 20th century ===

Cranks were formerly common on some machines in the early 20th century; for example almost all phonographs before the 1930s were powered by clockwork motors wound with cranks. Reciprocating piston engines use cranks to convert the linear piston motion into rotational motion. Internal combustion engines of early 20th century automobiles were usually started with hand cranks (known as &quot;starting handles&quot; in the UK), before electric starters came into general use. The last car model which incorporated a crank was the Citroën 2CV 1948-1990

The 1918 Reo owner&#x27;s manual describes how to hand crank the automobile:

* First: Make sure the gear shifting lever is in neutral position.
* Second: The clutch pedal is unlatched and the clutch engaged. The brake pedal is pushed forward as far as possible setting brakes on the rear wheel.
* Third: See that spark control lever, which is the short lever located on top of the steering wheel on the right side, is back as far as possible toward the driver and the long lever, on top of the steering column controlling the carburetor, is pushed forward about one inch from its retarded position.
* Fourth: Turn ignition switch to point marked &quot;B&quot; or &quot;M&quot;
* Fifth: Set the carburetor control on the steering column to the point marked &quot;START.&quot; Be sure there is gasoline in the carburetor. Test for this by pressing down on the small pin projecting from the front of the bowl until the carburetor floods. If it fails to flood it shows that the fuel is not being delivered to the carburetor properly and the motor cannot be expected to start. See instructions on page 56 for filling the vacuum tank.
* Sixth: When it is certain the carburetor has a supply of fuel, grasp the handle of starting crank, push in endwise to engage ratchet with crank shaft pin and turn over the motor by giving a quick upward pull. Never push down, because if for any reason the motor should kick back, it would endanger the operator.

== Crank axle ==
A crank axle is a crankshaft which also serves the purpose of an axle. It is used on steam locomotives with inside cylinders.

<text>A vicious circle (or cycle) is a complex chain of events that reinforces itself through a feedback loop, with detrimental results. It is a system with no tendency toward equilibrium (social, economic, ecological, etc.), at least in the short run. Each iteration of the cycle reinforces the previous one, in an example of positive feedback. A vicious circle will continue in the direction of its momentum until an external factor intervenes to break the cycle. A well-known example of a vicious circle in economics is hyperinflation. 

When the results are not detrimental but beneficial, the term virtuous cycle is used instead.

==Examples==
===Subprime mortgage crisis===
The contemporary subprime mortgage crisis is a complex group of vicious circles, both in its genesis and in its manifold outcomes, most notably the late 2000s recession. A specific example is the circle related to housing. As housing prices decline, more homeowners go &quot;underwater&quot;, when the market value of a home drops below that of the mortgage on it. This provides an incentive to walk away from the home, increasing defaults and foreclosures. This, in turn, lowers housing values further from over-supply, reinforcing the cycle.

The foreclosures reduce the cash flowing into banks and the value of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) widely held by banks. Banks incur losses and require additional funds, also called &quot;recapitalization&quot;. If banks are not capitalized sufficiently to lend, economic activity slows and unemployment increases, which further increase the number of foreclosures. Economist Nouriel Roubini discussed vicious circles in the housing and financial markets in interviews with Charlie Rose in September and October 2008.

===Ecological areas===
By involving all stakeholders in managing ecological areas, a virtuous circle can be created where improved ecology encourages the actions that maintain and improve the area.

===Other===
Other examples include the poverty cycle, sharecropping, and the intensification of drought. In 2021, Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg described the recurring need for lockdowns in the COVID-19 pandemic as a vicious circle that could only be broken by a legally-required vaccination program.

<text>H. Bustos Domecq (Honorio Bustos Domecq) is a pseudonym used for several collaborative works by the Argentine writers Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares.

==Origin==

Bustos Domecq made his first appearance as F. (Francisco) Bustos, the pseudonym under which Borges, in 1933, published his first fictional story, now known as &quot;Hombre de la esquina rosada&quot;, (&quot;Man from the Pink Corner&quot;) but originally titled &quot;Hombre de las orillas&quot; (&quot;Man from the Slums&quot; or more literally &quot;Man from the Outskirts&quot;), Francisco Bustos being the name of &quot;one forefather&#x27;s forefather&quot;.

He changed his first initial and acquired a second surname (which in Argentina connotes either &quot;old money&quot; or simply, as in the rest of Latin America, a maternal last name) as Borges and Bioy Casares later used the pseudonym &quot;H. Bustos Domecq&quot; for some of their lighter works. According to Borges, Bustos was the name of one of his great-grandfathers, while Domecq was the name of one of Bioy&#x27;s great-grandfathers.

==Works==

H. Bustos Domecq was the original credited author of the parodic detective stories in &quot;Seis problemas para don Isidro Parodi&quot;, 1942 (translated 1981 as &quot;Six Problems for Don Isidro Parodi&quot;) and &quot;Dos fantasías memorables&quot;, 1946 (&quot;Two memorable fancies&quot;).

Bustos was also the alleged author of &quot;Crónicas de Bustos Domecq&quot;, 1967, (translated by Norman Thomas Di Giovanni as &quot;Chronicles of Bustos Domecq&quot; (1976)), and &quot;Nuevos Cuentos de Bustos Domecq&quot; (1977), even though the authors&#x27; actual names were featured on the covers of both books.

Under another pseudonym, &quot;Benito Suárez Lynch&quot; (both surnames were taken from the authors&#x27; illustrious ancestors), Borges and Bioy published the parodic mystery &quot;Un modelo para la muerte&quot; (&quot;A model for death&quot;) in 1946, featuring the characters of the Isidro Parodi stories.

The pair also did some collaborations without the use of the pseudonym, notably two movie scripts from 1955: &quot;Los orilleros&quot; (&quot;Slum-dwellers&quot;) and &quot;El paraíso de los creyentes&quot; (The Paradise of Believers). Both dealt with the exacerbated sense of manhood among the &quot;compadritos&quot; in the slums of Buenos Aires circa 1900.

The Bustos Domecq materials provided comic relief for cultivated Latin Americans, but also, famously, conveyed a subtle yet unambiguous pro-allied message in the 1942 edition of &quot;Parodi&quot; – which was not a surprise for people who knew the authors but was, nevertheless, a contrarian statement given the state of Argentine politics at the time.

Note: The Isidro Parodi appears as &quot;Isidoro&quot; in some editions.

==Influence==

According to Emir Rodríguez Monegal in his April 1968 article &quot;Nota sobre Biorges&quot;, when Adolfo Bioy Casares and Jorge Luis Borges collaborated under the pseudonyms H. Bustos Domecq or B. Suárez Lynch, the results seemed written by a new personality, more than the sum of its parts, which he dubbed &quot;Biorges&quot; and considered in his own right as &quot;one of the most important Argentine prose writers of his time&quot;, for having influenced writers such as Leopoldo Marechal (an otherwise anti-Borgesian), or Julio Cortázar&#x27;s use of fictional language and slang in his masterpiece &quot;Hopscotch&quot;.

<text>The lindworm (&quot;worm&quot; meaning snake, see germanic dragon), also spelled lindwyrm or lindwurm, is a mythical creature in Northern, Western and Central European folklore that traditionally has the shape of a giant serpent monster which lives deep in the forest. It can be seen as a sort of dragon.

According to legend, everything that lies under a lindworm will increase as the lindworm grows. This belief gave rise to tales of dragons that brood over treasures to become richer. Legend tells of two kinds of lindworm: a good one, associated with luck, often a cursed prince who has been transformed into the beast (compare to the Frog Prince and Beauty and the Beast stories), and a bad one, a dangerous man-eater that will attack humans on sight. A lindworm may swallow its own tail, turning itself into a rolling wheel, to pursue fleeing humans (compare ouroboros and hoop snake).

The head of the 16th-century lindworm statue at Lindwurm Fountain () in Klagenfurt, Austria, is modeled on the skull of a woolly rhinoceros found in a nearby quarry in 1335. It has been cited as the earliest reconstruction of an extinct animal.

== Etymology ==
Lindworm derives from early medieval Germanic languages (Old High German: &quot;lintwurm&quot;, Old Low German: &quot;lindworm&quot;, Middle Dutch: &quot;lindeworm&quot;, Old Norse: &quot;linnormr&quot;, Old Swedish: &quot;lindormber&quot;) of uncertain origin, possibly from a Proto-Germanic form akin to “”. The name compounds Germanic &quot;lind&quot; with &quot;worm&quot;, the latter meaning &quot;snake, dragon&quot; (see Germanic dragon). The meaning of the prefix &quot;lind&quot; is also uncertain, perhaps it is from the Proto-Germanic adjective &quot;*linþia-,&quot; meaning &quot;flexible&quot;, or perhaps it is from the Old Danish/Old Saxon &quot;lithi&quot;, Old High German &quot;lindi&quot;, &quot;soft, mild&quot; (Middle High and Low German &quot;linde&quot;, German &quot;lind&quot;, &quot;(ge)linde&quot;), Old English &quot;liðe&quot; (English &quot;lithe&quot;, &quot;agile&quot;), alternatively something akin to Old Swedish &quot;linde&quot; (modern Swedish &quot;linda&quot;), existing as prefix &quot;lind-&quot; and &quot;linn-&quot;, meaning &quot;to wind&quot;, &quot;to turn coils around something&quot;.

The term occurs in Middle High German as &quot;lintwurm&quot; and Old Swedish as &quot;lindormber&quot; (modern Swedish &quot;lindorm&quot;, modern Danish &quot;lindorm&quot;), meaning &quot;lind-snake&quot;. In Old Icelandic, the term &quot;linnormr&quot; was used to translate German sources to produce Þiðreks saga (an Old Norse chivalric saga adapted from the continent from the late 13th c.)

== Portrayals ==

Lindworm portrayals vary across countries and the stories in which they appear.

=== Swedish lindworm (lindorm) ===
In Nordic folklore, specifically Swedish folklore, lindworms traditionally appear as giant forest serpents without limbs, living between rocks deep in the forest. They are said to be dark in color with a brighter underside. Along the spine, they are said to have either fish-like dorsal fins or a horse-like mane; for this reason, they are sometimes called a &quot;mane snake&quot; (). For defence and attack, lindworms can spit a foul milk-like substance that can blind enemies. 

Lindworm eggs are said to be laid under the bark of &quot;linden trees&quot; (). Once hatched, lindworms slither away and make a home in a pile of rocks. When fully grown, they can become extremely long. To counter this, during hunting they swallow their own tails to become a wheel and roll at extremely high speeds to pursue prey. This practice earned them the nickname &quot;wheel snake&quot; ().

==== Late belief in lindworms in Sweden ====
A belief in the reality of the &quot;lindorm&quot;, a giant limbless serpent, persisted well into the 19th century in some parts. In the mid-19th century, the Swedish folklorist Gunnar Olof Hyltén-Cavallius (1818–1889) collected stories of legendary creatures in Sweden and met several people in Småland, Sweden, who said they had encountered giant snakes, sometimes with a long mane. He gathered around 50 eyewitness reports and in 1884 offered a cash reward for a captured specimen, dead or alive. He was ridiculed by Swedish scholars, and because no one ever claimed the reward, the effort resulted in a cryptozoological defeat. Rumours of the existence of lindworms in Småland soon abated.

=== Central European lindworm (lindwurm) ===

In Central Europe the lindworm usually resembles a dragon or something similar. It generally appears with a scaly serpentine body, a dragon&#x27;s head, and two clawed forelimbs, sometimes with wings. Some examples, such as the 16th-century lindworm statue at Lindwurm Fountain in Klagenfurt, Austria, have four limbs and two wings.

Most limbed depictions imply that lindworms do not walk on two limbs like a wyvern but move like a mole lizard: they slither like a snake and use their arms for traction.

=== Lindworm offshoots (guivre, vouivre, wyvern) ===
There exist several related offshoots of the winged lindworm outside Northern and Central Europe, such as the French guivre, and to some extent the British wyvern. The French &quot;guivre&quot;, earlier &quot;vouivre&quot;, are more dragon-like than the traditional lindworms while the British wyvern is canonically a full-fledged dragon. These terms are ultimately derived from Latin &quot;vīpera&quot; &quot;adder, poisonous snake&quot;.

== In heraldry ==
According to the 19th-century English archaeologist Charles Boutell, a lindworm in heraldry is basically &quot;a dragon without wings&quot;. A different heraldic definition by German historian Maximilian Gritzner was &quot;a dragon with four feet&quot; instead of usual two, so that depictions with - comparatively smaller - wings exist as well.

== In tales ==
An Austrian tale from the 13th century tells of a lindworm that lived near Klagenfurt. Flooding threatened travelers along the river, and the presence of the lindworm was blamed. A duke offered a reward to anyone who could capture it and so some young men tied a bull to a chain, and when the lindworm swallowed the bull, it was hooked like a fish and killed.

The shed skin of a lindworm was believed to greatly increase a person&#x27;s knowledge about nature and medicine.

A serpentine monster with the head of a &quot;salamander&quot; features in the legend of the Lambton Worm, a serpent caught in the River Wear and dropped in a well, which 3–4 years thence, terrorized the countryside of Durham while the nobleman who caught it was at the Crusades. Upon return, he received spiked armour and instructions to kill the serpent, but thereafter to kill the next living thing he saw. His father arranged that after the lindworm was killed, a dog would be released for that purpose; but instead of releasing the dog the nobleman&#x27;s father ran to his son, and so incurred a malediction by the son&#x27;s refusal to commit patricide. Bram Stoker used this legend in his short story &quot;Lair of the White Worm&quot;.

The sighting of a &quot;whiteworm&quot; once was thought to be an exceptional sign of good luck.

A German folk legend, written in the 17th-century by Juspa Schammes, tells that the origin of the name of the city of Worms is rooted in a tale involving lindworm: This creature, resembling a snake and a worm, arrived in the city of Germisa and terrorized its inhabitants. Every day, the people held a lottery to determine which of them would be sacrificed to the lindworm in order to spare the city from destruction. Eventually, the lot fell on the queen. One of the city&#x27;s heroes refused to allow her to sacrifice herself and offered to replace her on the condition that if he survived, she would marry him. The queen agreed, and he donned iron armor. After the lindworm swallowed him, he cut his way out from the inside and killed it. He married the queen, became king, and renamed the city to Worms to commemorate this tale.

The knucker or the Tatzelwurm is a wingless biped, and often identified as a lindworm. In legends, lindworms are often very large and eat cattle and human corpses, sometimes invading churchyards and eating the dead from cemeteries.

In the 19th-century tale of &quot;Prince Lindworm&quot; (also &quot;King Lindworm&quot;) from Scandinavian folklore, a &quot;half-man half-snake&quot; lindworm is born, as one of twins, to a queen, who, in an effort to overcome her childlessness, followed the advice of an old crone who instructed her to eat two onions. As she did not peel the first onion, the first twin was born a lindworm. The second twin is perfect in every way. When he grows up and sets off to find a bride, the lindworm insists that a bride be found for him before his younger brother can marry. Because none of the chosen maidens are pleased by him, he eats each one until a shepherd&#x27;s daughter who spoke to the same crone is brought to marry him, wearing every dress she owns. The lindworm tells her to take off her dress, but she insists that he shed a skin for each dress she removes. Eventually, his human form is revealed beneath the last skin. Some versions of the story omit the lindworm&#x27;s twin, and the gender of the soothsayer varies. A similar tale occurs in the 1952 novel &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; by C. S. Lewis.

The tale of Prince Lindworm is part of a multiverse of tales in which a maiden is betrothed or wooed by a prince enchanted to be a snake or other serpentine creature (ATU 433B, &quot;The Prince as Serpent&quot;; &quot;King Lindworm&quot;).

In a short Swiss tale, a Lindworm terrorises the area around Grabs. &quot;It was as big as a tree trunk, dark red in colour and, according to its nature, extraordinarily vicious&quot;. It was defeated by a bull that had been fed milk for seven years and had hooks attached its horns. A girl, who had committed an offense, was tasked with bringing the bull to the Lindworm. After the beast was defeated, the enraged bull threw itself off a cliff, but the girl survived. In another tale, a cowherd falls into a cave where a Lindworm lives. Instead of eating him, the Lindworm shares his food source, a spring of liquid gold. After seven years, they are discovered by a Venetian who hauls up the Lindworm and ties it up. The cowherd releases the Lindworm, who kills the Venetian and then leaves. When the cowherd goes home, no one recognizes him and he no longer likes human food.

<text>The Style Council were an English pop band formed in Woking in 1982 by Paul Weller, the former lead vocalist, principal songwriter and guitarist with the rock band the Jam, and keyboardist Mick Talbot, previously a member of Dexys Midnight Runners, the Bureau and the Merton Parkas. Weller started the project to escape the restrictions of the Jam, and to explore a more arty, European, jazzier direction, which encompassed pop, hip hop, and soul.

The permanent line-up grew to include drummer Steve White and Weller&#x27;s then-girlfriend, vocalist Dee C. Lee. Other artists such as Tracie Young, Tracey Thorn (Everything but the Girl) and drummer/percussionist Steve Sidelnyk (who has played for Madonna, Seal and Richard Ashcroft) also performed and collaborated with the group. As with Weller&#x27;s previous band, most of the London-based group&#x27;s hits were in their homeland, where they scored seven top 10 hits. The band also had hit singles and albums in Australia and New Zealand during the 1980s.

== History ==
=== Formation and early releases ===
The band was founded in Woking, Surrey in late 1982 by Paul Weller and initially consisted only of himself and Mick Talbot, who Weller said he chose because &quot;he shares my hatred of the rock myth and the rock culture&quot;. The band showed a diversity of musical styles. Singles &quot;Speak Like a Child&quot; (with its loud soul-influenced style), the extended funk of &quot;Money-Go-Round&quot;, and the synth-ballad &quot;Long Hot Summer&quot; all featured Talbot on keyboards and organ, and reached number 4, number 11 and number 3, respectively, on the UK Singles Chart. Near the end of 1983, these songs were compiled on &quot;Introducing The Style Council&quot;, a mini-LP initially released in the US, Canada, Japan, and the Netherlands only. The Dutch version was heavily imported to the United Kingdom. In November 1983, the single &quot;A Solid Bond in Your Heart&quot; reached number 11 on the UK singles chart.

=== &quot;Café Bleu&quot; (1984) ===
In February 1984, the single &quot;My Ever Changing Moods&quot; became the band&#x27;s third Top 10 hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 5. Released a month later, their debut studio album, &quot;Café Bleu&quot;, entered the UK Albums Chart at number 2. Excluding previous singles (except for a different version of &quot;My Ever Changing Moods&quot;) and vocals by Weller on several tracks, the album features guest vocalists and instrumentals, and mixes several genres, such as jazz, soul, pop, and funk; for these reasons, it divided critics and confused fans. Nevertheless, the album spent 36 weeks on the chart and was followed by two further Top 10 singles, &quot;You&#x27;re the Best Thing&quot; in May and &quot;Shout to the Top!&quot; in October.

The album was complemented by a UK tour starting in March 1984 with supporting acts Billy Bragg and the Scottish pop band the Questions. These shows were dubbed &quot;Council Meetings&quot; and were followed by a brief European tour. Later the band played four dates in Japan, where they became hugely popular. These shows were captured on the video &quot;Far East and Far Out&quot;, released in September 1984. The band set out on their second &quot;Council Meetings&quot; UK tour in the autumn, this time with DJ Vaughn Toulouse. The shows were also intended to include a half-hour play directed by Tony Marchant instead of a support band, but the play was pulled in the last minute when one of the actors broke his leg. The UK dates were followed by dates in Italy were huge demands for tickets in Bologna forced a last-minute switch to a bigger venue.

In 1984, the band also undertook a brief tour of the United States. This led to the single &quot;My Ever Changing Moods&quot; reaching No. 29 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song remains the group&#x27;s and Weller&#x27;s highest charting US single, including his period with the group the Jam and also as a solo artist. By the end of 1984, the Style Council were voted &quot;best new band&quot; in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

In December 1984, &quot;Soul Deep&quot;, a fund-raising single for striking miners, was released under the name &quot;the Council Collective&quot; (featuring Vaughn Toulouse, Dee C. Lee, Leonardo Chignoli of Animal Nightlife, Junior Giscombe and US Motown artist Jimmy Ruffin), reaching the top 30 on the UK singles chart. The Style Council ended the year playing two nights at the Royal Albert Hall.

=== &quot;Our Favourite Shop&quot; (1985) ===
In the UK, the group reached the height of its popularity with the release of &quot;Our Favourite Shop&quot;, which entered the UK album chart at number 1 immediately following its release in June 1985 (only to be supplanted by Bryan Ferry&#x27;s solo studio album &quot;Boys and Girls&quot; a week later). Mixing different styles such as Latin music, jazz and funk, and largely featuring political lyrics, it was widely considered to be the band&#x27;s best work by contemporary critics. It notched up a total of 13 weeks in the UK top 40 (including a re-entry in October), of which three weeks were spent in the top 10. The preceding single &quot;Walls Come Tumbling Down!&quot; reached number 6 on the singles chart, while &quot;Come to Milton Keynes&quot; and &quot;The Lodgers&quot; reached number 23 and 13, respectively. A fourth single &quot;Boy Who Cried Wolf&quot; was released in the US and was a chart hit in New Zealand. Worldwide, it reached over one million sales. In 2015, &quot;Our Favourite Shop&quot; was included in a list of 50 albums released in 1985 which, according to the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;still sound great today&quot;.

Together with &quot;You&#x27;re the Best Thing&quot; (from &quot;Café Bleu&quot;) and &quot;The Big Boss Groove&quot;, two songs from the album—&quot;Internationalists&quot; and &quot;Walls Come Tumbling Down!&quot;—were played by the band at the UK Live Aid concert, where they appeared second in the running order at Wembley Stadium between Status Quo and the Boomtown Rats. The international exposure, however, did little to boost the group&#x27;s career, and future commercial success was largely confined to their home country.

=== Further albums ===
Following the live album &quot;Home and Abroad&quot; in 1986 the band released their third studio album &quot;The Cost of Loving&quot; to mixed reviews in 1987. It reached number 2 on the UK Albums Chart. The single from the album, &quot;It Didn&#x27;t Matter&quot; reached number 9 on the singles chart.

&quot;The Cost of Loving&quot; saw the group concentrating on the R&amp;B styles that had been growing in America during the eighties. Its urban contemporary feel was a jolt to listeners who had grown accustomed to the continental mix of soul music, jazz, and European folk styles that the band had displayed on their previous two studio albums. United States label Geffen Records heard the tracks and promptly dropped the Style Council from their roster. Socially conscious soul music pioneer Curtis Mayfield was asked to mix some of the material on the album, which displays hints of being influenced by house music and the Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis sound. Tracks from the album were included in a 37-minute film, &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, about the band.

=== Commercial and critical decline ===
From this point the band however started to experience a critical and commercial decline. The 1987 single &quot;Waiting&quot; was the first of the band&#x27;s singles that failed to reach the UK top 40. In 1988 &quot;Confessions of a Pop Group&quot; became the first of their albums that failed to reach the top 10. It entered the albums chart at number 15 and dropped out of the chart a few weeks later. The singles &quot;Life at a Top People&#x27;s Health Farm&quot; and &quot;How She Threw It All Away&quot; also made brief chart appearances, peaking at number 28 and 41, respectively.

In 1989, members of the Style Council went under the name of King Truman to release a single on Acid Jazz Records titled &quot;Like a Gun&quot;. This was unknown to Polydor, and the single was pulled from the shops three days prior to release. Acid Jazz founder Eddie Piller said: &quot;The pair offered to make a single for my new label, which I&#x27;d just started with [BBC] Radio 1 DJ Gilles Peterson as a side project. Talbot and Weller took pseudonyms Truman King and Elliott Arnold.&quot;

The Style Council broke up in 1989. Regarding the break-up, Paul Weller said (in 1990):
The cover version of &quot;Promised Land&quot; (originally by Joe Smooth) was the only release which surfaced from the &quot;&quot; sessions at the time; reaching its peak position at no. 27 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1989. However, the entire studio album was subsequently released in 1998 in a 5-CD box set, &quot;The Complete Adventures of The Style Council&quot; with a standalone version being released in October, 2001. A few months later, a version of their 1983 hit &quot;Long Hot Summer&quot; entitled &quot;Long Hot Summer &#x27;89&quot; was released as the Style Council&#x27;s swan song single, briefly charting in the UK, reaching its peak position at no. 48 in May 1989.

In 1990, the band reunited (without Lee) for a one-off performance on Japanese TV.

=== 2019 reunion ===
Weller, Talbot, Lee and White met for a recording session of &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Deep Sea&quot; in August 2019. The session was featured in the 2020 Sky Arts documentary &quot;Long Hot Summers: The Story of the Style Council&quot;, and a career-spanning audio compilation of the same name was released.

== Politics ==
In December 1984, Weller put together an ensemble called the Council Collective to make a charity record, &quot;Soul Deep&quot;, initially to raise money for striking miners during a long-running industrial dispute, and subsequently also for the family of David Wilkie, a taxi driver who was killed during said strike. The track featured the Style Council and a number of other performers, notably Jimmy Ruffin and Junior Giscombe. The song received airplay on BBC Radio 1 and was performed by the group on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, as well as (live) on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Tube&quot;.

In their lyrics, the Style Council took a more overtly political approach than the Jam, with tracks such as &quot;Walls Come Tumbling Down!&quot;, &quot;The Lodgers&quot; and &quot;Come to Milton Keynes&quot; being deliberate attacks on middle England and the Thatcherite policies of the UK government during the 1980s. In 1985, Weller was persuaded by Billy Bragg to let the Style Council play a leading role in Red Wedge, a youth-orientated political campaign associated with the British Labour Party. Although his views at the time have since been described as those of a &quot;traditional British socialist&quot;, in 1993 Weller admitted the experience had left him feeling &quot;exploited&quot; by politicians, noting further that: &quot;Before the Wedge, the Style Council had done a lot independently, raised a lot of money in benefits. But after the Wedge we were so disillusioned it all stopped. We were totally cynical about all of it.&quot; In a previous interview, whilst asserting that there was still &quot;a place for outspokenness&quot; in popular music, Weller had pointed out he was &quot;first and foremost&quot; a musician, and stated: &quot;In the &#x27;80s, in the Style Council, we were involved with a lot of political things going on at that time. I think after a while that overshadowed the music a bit.&quot;

<doc id="384273" wikidata="Q1146109" url="?curid=384273" title="Metropolitan Transportation Authority">
<text>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is a public benefit corporation in New York State responsible for public transportation in the New York City metropolitan area. The MTA is the largest public transit authority in North America, serving 12 counties in Downstate New York, along with two counties in southwestern Connecticut under contract to the Connecticut Department of Transportation, carrying over 11 million passengers on an average weekday systemwide, and over 850,000 vehicles on its seven toll bridges and two tunnels per weekday.

==History==
===Founding===
In February 1965, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller suggested that the New York State Legislature create an authority to purchase, operate, and modernize the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). The LIRR, then a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), had been operating under bankruptcy protection since 1949. The proposed authority would also have the power to make contracts or arrangements with other commuter rail operators in the New York City area. On June 1, 1965, the legislature chartered the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (MCTA) to take over the operations of the LIRR. Governor Rockefeller appointed his top aide, William J. Ronan, as chairman and chief executive officer of the MCTA. In June 1965, the state finalized an agreement to buy the LIRR from the PRR for $65 million. The MCTA made a down payment of $10 million for the LIRR in December 1965, and it completed the rest of the payment the next month.

In February 1965, Rockefeller and Connecticut Governor John N. Dempsey jointly suggested that operations of the New Haven Line, the New Haven Railroad&#x27;s struggling commuter rail operation, be transferred to the New York Central Railroad as part of a plan to prevent the New Haven Railroad from going bankrupt. If the operational merger occurred, the proposed MCTA and the existing Connecticut Transportation Authority would contract with New York Central to operate the New Haven Line to Grand Central Terminal. A September 1965 joint report from both agencies, recommended that the line be leased to New York Central for 99 years, with the MCTA and CTA acting as agents for both states.

In October 1965, the MCTA found that the New Haven Line&#x27;s stations and infrastructure were even more decrepit than those of the LIRR. The New Haven Railroad&#x27;s trustees initially opposed New York Central&#x27;s takeover of the New Haven Line, as they felt that the $140 million offer for the New Haven Line was too low. After some discussion, the trustees decided to continue operating the New Haven Line until June 1967.

In January 1966, New York City Mayor John Lindsay proposed merging the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), which operated buses and subways in New York City, and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA), which operated toll bridges and tunnels within the city. Rockefeller offered his &quot;complete support&quot; for Lindsay&#x27;s proposed unified transit agency, while longtime city planner and TBTA chair Robert Moses called the proposed merger &quot;absurd&quot; and &quot;grotesque&quot; for its unwieldiness. In June 1966, Rockefeller announced his plans to expand the MCTA&#x27;s scope to create a new regional transit authority. The new authority would encompass the existing MCTA, as well as the NYCTA and TBTA. Lindsay disagreed, saying that the state and city should have operationally separate transit authorities that worked in tandem.

In May 1967, Rockefeller signed a bill that allowed the MCTA to oversee the mass transit policies of New York City-area transit systems. The unification agreement took place the following March, with the MCTA taking over the operations of the LIRR, NYCTA, TBTA, New Haven commuter services, New York Central commuter services, and the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railway. Initially, the TBTA was resistant to the MCTA&#x27;s efforts to acquire it. Moses was afraid that the enlarged MCTA would &quot;undermine, destroy or tarnish&quot; the integrity of the TBTA, One source of contention was Rockefeller&#x27;s proposal to use TBTA tolls in order to subsidize the cheap fares of the NYCTA, since Moses strongly opposed any use of TBTA tolls by outside agencies. In February 1968, Moses acquiesced to the MCTA&#x27;s merger proposal. New York Central and the PRR merged in February 1968, forming the Penn Central Transportation Company.

In February 1968, the MCTA published a 56-page report for Governor Rockefeller, proposing several subway and railroad improvements under the name &quot;Metropolitan Transportation, a Program for Action&quot; alternatively called the &quot;Grand Design&quot;. The city had already intended to build subway extensions in all four boroughs, so that most riders would need at most one transfer to get to their destination. The Program for Action also called for upgrades to the Penn Central railroads and area airports. The Program for Action was put forward simultaneously with other development and transportation plans under the administration of Mayor Lindsay. This included Lindsay&#x27;s Linear City plan for housing and educational facilities, and the projected construction of several Interstate Highways, many of which had originally been proposed by Robert Moses.

=== Expanded purview ===
On March 1, 1968, the day after the release of the Program for Action, the MCTA dropped the word &quot;Commuter&quot; from its name and became the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The MTA took over the operations of the other New York City-area transit systems. Moses was let go from his job as chairman of the TBTA, although he was retained as a consultant. The construction of two proposed bridges over the Long Island Sound was put under the jurisdiction of the MTA. Moses stated that TBTA construction projects would reduce the MTA&#x27;s budget surplus through to 1970. Chairman Ronan pushed for the MTA to pursue the Program for Action, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re making up for 30 years of do-nothingism&quot;.

Ronan proposed that the MTA take over the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railway Company from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and start a $25 million modernization project on the railway. The city&#x27;s Board of Estimate approved this purchase in December 1969. The MTA took ownership of the Staten Island Rapid Transit in January 1971.

The agency entered into a long-term lease of Penn Central&#x27;s Hudson, Harlem, and New Haven Lines. Before 1968, the Hudson and Harlem Lines had been operated by the New York Central Railroad, while the New Haven Line had been part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. Penn Central continued to operate the lines under contract to the MTA. In April 1970, Rockefeller proposed that the state take over the Hudson and Harlem Lines. The next month, he signed a bond issue that provided $44.4 million in funding to these lines. Penn Central&#x27;s operations were folded into Conrail in 1976. The MTA took over full operations in 1983, and merged the lines into the Metro-North Commuter Railroad. In 1994, the MTA rebranded its five subsidiaries with simpler names to convey that the different agencies were part of one agency.

==Responsibilities and service area==
The MTA has the responsibility for developing and implementing a unified mass transportation policy for the New York metropolitan area, including all five boroughs of New York City and the suburban counties of Dutchess, Nassau, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester. This twelve-county area make up the &quot;Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District&quot; (MCTD), within which the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance levies a &quot;metropolitan commuter transportation mobility tax&quot;. On April 1, 2019, Patrick J. Foye was appointed chairman and CEO.

The MTA&#x27;s immediate past chairpersons were William J. Ronan (1965–1974), David Yunich (1974–1975), Harold L. Fisher (1975–1979), Richard Ravitch (1979–1983), Robert Kiley (1983–1991), Peter Stangl (1991–1995), Virgil Conway (1995–2001), Peter S. Kalikow (2001–2007), H. Dale Hemmerdinger (2007–2009), Jay Walder (2009–2011), Joseph Lhota (2012), Thomas F. Prendergast (2013–2017), and Joseph Lhota (2017–2018). Lhota was re-appointed in 2017 and resigned on November 9, 2018.

The MTA considers itself to be the largest regional public transportation provider in the Western Hemisphere. , its agencies serve a region of approximately 15.3 million people spread over in 12 counties in New York and two in Connecticut. MTA agencies now move about 8.6 million customers per day (translating to 2.65 billion rail and bus customers a year) and employ about 74,000 people. The MTA&#x27;s systems carry over 11 million passengers on an average weekday systemwide, and over 850,000 vehicles on its seven toll bridges and two tunnels per weekday.

==Subsidiaries and affiliates==
MTA carries out these planning and other responsibilities both directly and through its subsidiaries and affiliates, and provides oversight to these subordinate agencies, known collectively as &quot;The Related Entities&quot;. The Related Entities represent a number of previously existing agencies which have come under the MTA umbrella. These previously existing agencies were, with the exception of MTA Bridges and Tunnels, MTA Construction and Development &amp; MTA Grand Central Madison Concourse, successors to the property of private companies that provided substantially the same services.

In 1994, the MTA spent $3 million rebranding its five subsidiaries with simpler names to convey that the different agencies were part of one agency. Surveys found that a majority of riders did not know that the MTA owned the Long Island Rail Road or the Metro-North Railroad. As part of the changes, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority was renamed MTA Bridges and Tunnels; Staten Island Rapid Transit was renamed MTA Staten Island Railway; Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority was renamed MTA Long Island Bus. The New York City Transit Authority was renamed MTA New York City Transit to seem less authoritarian, Metro–North Commuter Railroad was renamed MTA Metro-North Railroad to recognize the increase in non-commuter ridership.

The MTA logo was changed from a two-toned &quot;M&quot; logo, to a blue circle with the MTA initials written in perspective, as if they were rushing by like a train. The large &quot;M&quot; logos on trains and buses were replaced with decals that state MTA New York City Bus, MTA New York City Subway or MTA Staten Island Railway, eliminating inconsistencies in signage. Today, the older &quot;M&quot; logos survive on existing cube-shaped lamps on station lampposts dating to the 1980s, though such lamps have been updated with more modern spherical lamps over time.

Today, each of these Related Entities has a &quot;popular name&quot; and in some cases, a former &quot;legal name&quot;. Since 1994, the legal name has only been used for legal documents, such as contracts, and have not been used publicly. Since the mid-2000s, the popular name has also been used for legal documents related to contract procurements where the legal name was used heretofore. Both are listed below.

===Subsidiary agencies===
* MTA Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)&quot;(legal name, no longer used publicly: The Long Island Rail Road Company)&quot;
* MTA Metro-North Railroad (MNR)&quot;(legal name, no longer used publicly: Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company)&quot;

** MTA Bus &quot;(legal name, sometimes used publicly: MTA Bus Company)&quot;
** MTA New York City Bus
* First Mutual Transportation Assurance Company (legal name, not used publicly; no public name)

===Affiliate agencies===
* MTA Bridges and Tunnels (MTA B&amp;T)&quot;(legal name, no longer used publicly: Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority&quot;)
* MTA New York City Transit (NYCT)&quot; (legal name, no longer used publicly: New York City Transit Authority and its subsidiary, the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority (MaBSTOA))&quot;The Bus division is now managed under Regional Bus.

===Former subsidiaries===
* MTA Long Island Bus&quot;(legal name, no longer used: Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority)&quot;From January 1, 2012, this division was operated by Veolia Transport (now Transdev, Inc.) as &quot;Nassau Inter-County Express&quot;.

== MTA Inspector General ==
The Office of the MTA Inspector General (OIG), founded in 1983, is the independent Office of Inspector General specific to the MTA that is responsible for conducting monitoring and oversight of MTA activities, programs, and employees.

==Governance==
The MTA is governed by a 21-member board representing the 5 boroughs of New York City, each of the counties in its New York State service area, and worker and rider interest groups. Of these, there are 14 voting members, broken down into 13 board members who cast individual votes, 4 board members who cast a single collective vote, and 6 group representatives who do not vote.

Five members as well as the chairman/CEO are directly nominated by the Governor of New York, while four are recommended by New York City&#x27;s mayor. The county executives of Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester counties nominate one member each. Each of these members has one vote. The county executives of Dutchess, Orange, Rockland, and Putnam counties also nominate one member each, but these members cast one collective vote. The Board has six rotating nonvoting seats held by representatives of MTA employee organized labor and the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, which represent customers of MTA transit and commuter facilities. Board members are confirmed by the New York State Senate.

In 2017, the MTA had operating expenses of $16.85 billion, an outstanding debt of $38.083 billion, and a level of staffing of 79,832 people (staff compensation totaled $6.762 billion). It collects revenue from passenger fees and from a Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax, a payroll tax levied on employers in the 12-county area served by the MTA.

===Board Chair position===
Historically, some but not all chairmen of the MTA Board have also held the chief executive officer role, with the chairman providing an advisory and policy role and the Executive Director running day-to-day operations. The roles were combined in 2009 following the recommendation a commission to study capital spending. The commission was appointed by then-Governor David Paterson and run by former chairman Richard Ravitch However, following Thomas Prendergast&#x27;s retirement in 2017, they were split back again. The positions were merged back into one position in 2019 when Pat Foye was appointed Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer. The current chairman, Janno Lieber, holds both positions.

The following is a list of chairmen of the authority:
;Notes
a Lhota did not serve as CEO in his second stint as chairman, as CEO responsibilities were carried out by Executive Director Ronnie Hakim.

b Lieber served as Chair and CEO in an acting capacity from July 30, 2021 to January 19, 2022.

The following is a list of members of the MTA Board.
== Apps ==
The MTA has developed several official web and mobile apps for its subway and bus services, and also provides data to private app developers to create their own unofficial MTA apps. In 2012, the MTA officially released the Subway Time app, which uses subway countdown clock data to determine the next-train arrival times on seven services. Real-time station information for the &quot;mainline&quot; A Division (numbered routes), comprising all numbered services except the 7 train, was made available to third-party developers via an API. This was achieved through both the Subway Time mobile app and as open data. In early 2014, data for the L train were also given to developers. When Bluetooth-enabled countdown clocks were installed in the B Division (lettered services) in 2016 and 2017, they were also configured to feed data to the Subway Time app as well as in an open-data format.

MTA&#x27;s Bus Time app originated as a pilot program to install bus countdown clocks along the M16 and M34 routes in August 2009. At the same time, many new buses were retrofitted with GPS-enabled automatic vehicle location systems. In October 2010, the developers of the buses&#x27; GPS devices implemented the MTA system&#x27;s first bus-tracking app, which monitored buses along the M16 and M34 routes. This evolved into the current web app, which originally tracked buses along the route in Brooklyn when it started in February 2011. By January 2012, every local and express bus in Staten Island was equipped with the system. The M34 corridor began using the system on April 6, 2012 with nearly every Bronx bus route using the system by the end of 2012. All five boroughs of the city used the system by March 2014, and a mobile app was released in 2015.

In 2011, the MTA began to look at ways of displaying service disruptions due to weekend engineering works in a visual format. On September 16, 2011, the MTA introduced a Vignelli-style interactive subway map, &quot;The Weekender&quot;, to its website. The web app provided a way for riders to get information about any planned work, from late Friday night to early Monday morning, that is going on either on a service(s) or station(s) of the subway during the weekends. On June 11, 2012, the MTA duplicated &quot;The Weekender&quot; site as a free mobile app download for iOS. On November 29, 2012, an Android version of the app was released.

The MTA announced plans to integrate all three apps in 2017. The combined app, which was scheduled for release in 2018, would include real-time arrival information for all subway and bus routes, as well as weekend service changes and travel planners. In April 2018, the MTA started testing MYmta, which provides arrival information for MTA railroad, subway, and bus routes; escalator and elevator outage information; and real-time service changes. The app also includes an improved version of the MTA&#x27;s Trip Planner; whereas the existing Trip Planner can only plan trips along MTA-operated modes of transportation, MYmta&#x27;s Trip Planner can also suggest routes via other operators such as the Staten Island Ferry, NYC Ferry, PATH, and NJ Transit. A beta version of MYmta was released to the general public in July of that year. In future versions of the MYmta app, the MTA planned to integrate the eTix functionality, as well as make it easier for Access-A-Ride customers to view when their vehicle will arrive at a certain point.

In October 2020, the MTA unveiled a new digital map providing real-time arrival estimates and service updates. It was developed pro bono by technology and design company Work &amp; Co.

== Fare collection ==

The subway, buses, and Staten Island Railway charge a single flat fare for each trip, regardless of time or distance traveled. From the MTA&#x27;s inception until 2003, the agency collected subway and bus fares via a series of small metal tokens. The MTA cycled through several series of tokens throughout the late 20th century. In 1993, MTA started testing the MetroCard, a magnetic stripe card that would replace the tokens used to pay fares. By 1997, the entire bus and subway system accepted MetroCard, and tokens were no longer accepted for fare payment in 2003.

A different fare payment system is used on the LIRR and Metro-North. Both railroads sell tickets based on geographical &quot;zones&quot; and time of day, charging peak and off-peak fares. Tickets may be bought from a ticket office at stations, ticket vending machines (TVMs), online through the &quot;WebTicket&quot; program, or through apps for iOS and Android devices.

In 2017 it was announced that the MetroCard would be phased out and replaced by OMNY, a contactless fare payment system, with fare payment being made using Apple Pay, Google Wallet, debit/credit cards with near-field communication enabled, or radio-frequency identification cards. As of December 31, 2020, the entire bus and subway system is OMNY-enabled. However, support of the MetroCard is slated to remain until at least 2025. MTA also plans to use OMNY in the LIRR and Metro-North.

===Ghost plates on bridges and tunnels===
The MTA has reported a 12.6 percent increase in toll evasion on New York City bridges and tunnels during the first four months of 2024. This equates to an average of 398,975 missed monthly toll transactions, primarily due to drivers obscuring their license plate. The MTA estimates that this evasion costs the agency approximately $50 million annually. Of the unbillable toll transactions, roughly 80,000 per month are attributed to fake or unreadable license plates, while 155,000 are due to obstructed plates. Unregistered or temporary plates primarily cause the remaining balance.

== Issues ==

=== Expenses ===
==== Budget gaps ====
The budget deficit of the MTA is a growing crisis for the organization as well as for New York City and State residents and governments. The MTA held $31 billion in debt in 2010 and it also suffered from a $900 million gap in its operating budget for 2011. The capital budget, which covers repairs, technological upgrades, new trains, and expansions, is currently $15 billion short of what the MTA states it needs. If this is not funded, the MTA will fund the repairs with debt and raise fares to cover repayments.

The MTA has consistently run on a deficit, but increased spending in 2000–04 coupled with the economic downturn led to a severe increase in the financial burden that the MTA bore. The budget problems stem from multiple sources. The MTA cannot be supported solely by rider fares and road tolls. In the preliminary 2011 budget, MTA forecasted operating revenue totaled at $6.5 billion, amount to only 50% of the $13 billion operating expenses. Therefore, the MTA must rely on other sources of funding to remain operational. Revenue collected from real estate taxes for transportation purposes helped to contain the deficit. However, due to the weak economy and unstable real estate market, money from these taxes severely decreased; in 2010, tax revenue fell at least 20% short of the projected value. Beyond this, steadily reducing support from city and state governments led to borrowing money by issuing bonds, which contributed heavily to the debt.

This budget deficit has resulted in various problems, mainly concentrated in New York City. New York City Subway fares have been increased four times since 2008, with the most recent occurring August 20, 2023, raising single-ride fares from $2.75 to $2.90, express service from $6.75 to $7.00 and the monthly MetroCard fare from $116 to $132. Each fare raise was met with increasing resistance by MTA customers, and many are beginning to find the fare increases prohibitive. 2010 also saw heavy service cuts for many MTA subsidiaries. Fewer trains spaced farther between resulted in heavy overcrowding beyond normal rush hours, leading to frustration for many subway and bus riders. In 2013, the subway had the highest ridership since 1947. MTA employees also suffered due to the budget issues. By mid-July 2010, MTA layoffs had reached over 1,000, and many of those affected were low-level employees who made less than $55,000 annually.

, the MTA was running a $15 billion deficit in its $32 billion 2015–2019 Capital Plan. Without extra funding, many necessary construction and renovation projects would not be performed. In October 2015, the MTA passed the $29 billion 2015–2019 Capital Plan, the largest capital plan in MTA&#x27;s history; it will be funded by federal, state and city government as well as riders&#x27; fares and tolls. Three months later, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and MTA chairman Thomas Prendergast unveiled their plan to spend $26 billion to modernize the subway network, which includes adding Wi-Fi and cellphone services throughout all 278 underground stations by the end of 2016. Other plans call for making extensive renovations to 30 subway stations, allowing mobile ticketing by cellphone or bank cards, and adding security cameras on buses, charging stations for electronics, and more countdown clocks. Roughly $3 billion will be spent to improve bridges and tunnels.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, following a 50% to 90% drop in ridership on all of the MTA&#x27;s systems, the agency requested $4 billion in federal funds, since the decreased fare revenue left the already-struggling agency in a financially tenuous position. After the subway was temporarily shuttered at night starting in May 2020, trains and stations were cleaned more than usual. Over 132 employees died of COVID-19 .

On February 1, 2023, as part of her Executive Budget proposal to the New York State Legislature, Governor Kathy Hochul proposed raising the MTA payroll tax, a move projected to increase revenue by $800 million, and also giving the MTA some of the money from casinos expected at present to be licensed soon for business in Manhattan.

==== Reasons for high costs ====
On November 18, 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an investigation into the problems underlying the MTA. It found that politicians from both the Democratic and Republican parties, at the mayoral and gubernatorial levels, had gradually removed $1.5 billion of MTA funding. Other actions by city and state politicians, according to the &quot;Times&quot;, included overspending; overpaying unions and interest groups; advertising superficial improvement projects while ignoring more important infrastructure; and agreeing to high-interest loans that would have been unnecessary without their other interventions. The &quot;Times&quot; stressed that no single event directly caused the crisis; rather, it was an accumulation of small cutbacks and maintenance deferments. The MTA funds were described as a &quot;piggy bank&quot; for the state, with the issuance of MTA bonds benefiting the state at the MTA&#x27;s expense. By 2017, a sixth of the MTA&#x27;s budget was allocated to paying off debt, a threefold increase from the proportion in 1997. The city&#x27;s $250 million annual contribution to the MTA budget in 2017 was a quarter of the contribution in 1990. David L. Gunn, who helped end a transit crisis when he led the NYCTA in the mid-1980s, described the 2017 crisis as &quot;heartbreaking&quot;.

In December of the same year, the &quot;Times&quot; reported that the $12 billion East Side Access project, which would extend the LIRR to Grand Central Terminal upon its completion, was the most expensive of its kind in the world, with a projected price of $3.5 billion per mile of track. Over the years, the projected cost of East Side Access had risen by billions of dollars due to unnecessary expenses. In addition to overpaying workers and overspending, politicians and trade unions had forced the MTA to hire more workers than was needed. In 2010, an accountant found that the project was hiring 200 extra workers, at a cost of $1,000 per worker per day, for no apparent reason. The bidding process for MTA construction contracts also raised costs because, in some cases, only one or two contractors would bid on a project. Similar construction projects in New York City, such as the Second Avenue Subway and 7 Subway Extension, had been more expensive than comparable projects elsewhere for the same reasons, even though other cities&#x27; transit systems faced similar, or greater, problems compared to the MTA. In March 2018, the federal Government Accountability Office ordered an audit of the United States&#x27; transit costs, which were generally higher than in any other developed country in the world. The GAO planned to devote special attention to the MTA&#x27;s transit costs.

The MTA has long struggled to control costs due to contracting fraud and corruption. In 2012, MTA executive Mario Guerra attempted to secure a job with train manufacturer Bombardier while evaluating their bid for a $600 million project. Paresh Patel, an MTA manager responsible for the oversight of repair contracts in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, created and awarded contracts to his own engineering firm staffed with friends with few formal qualifications in engineering. After deleting thousands of company emails, Patel pleaded guilty to obstructing federal bid rigging and fraud investigations in March 2020. In 2022, construction manager Ramnarace Mahabir was found to have provided jobs for family members through the routing of $18 million in bus depot contracts. At one 2018 board meeting, an MTA executive explicitly noted the sentiment that the authority is willing to assign jobs to contractors with prior histories of corruption.

===Advertisement bans===
The MTA collected $707 million from advertising on its trains and buses in 2018. In June 1992, the MTA banned tobacco advertising on subways, buses and commuter rail, costing the agency $4.5 million in annual advertising revenue. The tobacco advertisements were removed once the advertising contracts expired. They were removed from subways, buses, and bus shelters by the start of 1993, from the commuter rail lines by the start of 1994, and from Long Island Bus vehicles by the start of 1997.

The MTA refused to display an ad in the New York City Subway system in 2012, which read: &quot;In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.&quot; The authority&#x27;s decision was overturned in July 2012 when Judge Paul A. Engelmayer of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that the ad of the American Freedom Defense Initiative is protected speech under the First Amendment, and that the MTA&#x27;s actions were unconstitutional. The judge held in a 35-page opinion that the rejected ad was &quot;not only protected speech — it is core political speech ... [which as such] is afforded the highest level of protection under the First Amendment.&quot; The MTA had received $116.4 million in revenue in 2011 from advertising sold throughout its subway, commuter rail, and bus systems.

In April 2015, another ad became the subject of controversy when the MTA refused to display it, the refusal was again challenged in court, and the MTA again lost in court and was ordered by a federal judge to display the ad. The ad, paid for by the American Freedom Defense Initiative, showed a man with a scarf covering his face, with the caption &quot;Killing Jews is Worship that draws us close to Allah&quot;, which was attributed to &quot;Hamas MTV,&quot; and then stated: &quot;That&#x27;s His Jihad. What&#x27;s yours?&quot; The ad included a disclaimer that the display of the ad did not reflect the opinion of the MTA. U.S. District Judge John Koeltl of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan said the ad was protected speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and rejected the MTA&#x27;s argument that the ad might endorse terrorism or violence. Pamela Geller, president of the group that sued the MTA in order to run the ads, lauded the decision, and a lawyer for the organization said the same decision had been made in Washington and Philadelphia.

A week afterward, the MTA&#x27;s board in a 9–2 vote banned all political, religious, and opinion advertisements on subways and buses, limiting any ads to commercial ones. Specifically, it banned advertisements that &quot;prominently or predominately advocate or express a political message&quot; about &quot;disputed economic, political, moral, religious or social issues,&quot; and any ad that &quot;promotes or opposes&quot; a political party, ballot referendum, and &quot;the election of any candidate&quot;. The board estimated that the ads that the board was banning made up less than $1 million of the MTA&#x27;s advertising revenue of $138 million in 2014. Nevertheless, lawyers for the American Freedom Defense Initiative called the MTA&#x27;s action a &quot;disingenuous attempt to circumvent&quot; the judge&#x27;s order.

Another controversy regarding MTA ads arose in 2018. After initially rejecting proposed advertisements from Unbound, a sex-toy retailer, the MTA allowed the ads. Previous advertisement proposals from companies, such as female-hygiene retailer Thinx&#x27;s ad proposal in 2015, had been rejected and later approved due to &quot;dissemination of indecent material to minors&quot; and &quot;public display[s] of offensive sexual material.&quot;

===2017–2021 transit crisis===
In June 2017, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency for the MTA due to ongoing reliability and crowding problems. This order applied particularly to the New York City Subway, which was the most severely affected by dilapidated infrastructure, causing overcrowding and delays. With many parts of the system approaching or exceeding 100 years of age, general deterioration could be seen in many subway stations. By 2017, only 65% of weekday trains reached their destinations on time, the lowest rate since a transit crisis in the 1970s. A corresponding bus crisis was not covered as heavily in the media, but in November 2017, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer identified several causes for the bus system&#x27;s unreliability. The average speeds of New York City buses were found to be , the slowest of any major bus system nationwide.

== Campaigns ==

===Safety campaign===

In 2002, following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the MTA introduced the slogan &quot;If you see something, say something.&quot; The campaign, which was based from a theme created by Korey Kay &amp; Partners, consisted of public safety announcements, posted on advertisement boards in stations, subway, buses, and trains, urging people to report suspicious activity. Allen Kay, CEO of Korey Kay and Partners, stated in 2007 that the company had to do a lot of research to ensure that consumers understood the message correctly. Since 2002 the campaign has evolved from simple print ads to television spots, and reports of suspicious packages in the system rose over 40-fold, from 814 in 2002 to over 37,000 in 2003.

The MTA moved to trademark the slogan in 2005. The slogan was used by more than 30 other &quot;transport and governmental&quot; organizations by 2007. That year, the MTA spent $3 million to run 4,000 television ads and 84 newspaper ads in 11 total papers, over a span of more than four months. The idea gained traction, and in 2010, the domestic-security branch of the United States federal government, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), started its own &quot;see something, say something&quot; campaign. Kevin Ortiz, a spokesman for the MTA, described the slogan as having &quot;engaged the public in serving as the eyes and ears of our system.&quot;

Meanwhile, the DHS&#x27;s campaign had attracted at least 215 partners in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors by 2014, which one writer called &quot;a true smart practice.&quot; However, the MTA program has not been universally well-received; in 2012, sociologists from New York University and the Illinois Institute of Technology noted that the campaign had not netted any thwarted terrorist plots, and that the sheer volume of calls to the MTA hotline resulted in MTA workers possibly not being able to identify genuine threats.

In 2016, MTA updated the campaign, renaming it &quot;New Yorkers Keep New York Safe.&quot; As before, the campaign features public service announcements in advertisement spaces. However, this new campaign now features the pictures, names, and quotes of New Yorkers who called to report suspicious people or things on the MTA&#x27;s system. The rebooted campaign also shows 15- to 30-second videos of these New Yorkers who speak about their experiences. The two-year &quot;New Yorkers Keep New York Safe&quot; campaign received $2 million of funding from the DHS. The MTA still owns the trademark for &quot;If you see something, say something.&quot;

=== Courtesy campaigns ===
In MTA buses, there are stickers plastered on the frontmost seats. The front seats are priority seating, and the stickers state &quot;Won&#x27;t you please give up your seat to the disabled or elderly&quot; with the &quot;o&quot; in &quot;Won&#x27;t&quot; replaced with a heart symbol. In 2009, it was codified into an enforceable policy that could be punished with a fine.

Since 2014, the MTA has had a &quot;Courtesy Counts&quot; campaign consisting of posters that show colored stick figures having either correct or incorrect etiquette. Green stick figures show what riders should do, such as taking off their backpacks, while red stick figures show what riders should not do, such as manspreading. All of the posters have the tagline “Courtesy Counts: Manners Make a Better Ride.” Starting in January 2015, these posters were installed in subway cars, with the posters coming to commuter rail and buses the following month.

In May 2017, the MTA started a three-month pilot program to encourage riders to give up their seats for the pregnant, disabled, or elderly. It created a website where pregnant women, the disabled, and the elderly could request specialized buttons. There are two designs: a &quot;Baby on Board&quot; button for pregnant mothers and a more generic &quot;Please offer me a seat&quot; button. This idea stemmed from the &quot;Baby on Board&quot; buttons that were given out across the London Underground in 2013 after the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, wore such a button there.

The MTA launched the &quot;Hate Has No Place in Our Transportation System&quot; campaign in January 2020. This involved placing notices on several thousand subway and bus screens.

===2021 onsite COVID-19 vaccinations===
In May 2021, the MTA operated eight walk-up COVID-19 vaccination sites in subway, Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road stations as part of a five-day pilot project. This pilot project was subsequently extended another week at two stations. Over 11,000 people received the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine as part of the program.

<doc id="384279" wikidata="Q1397673" url="?curid=384279" title="Kintpuash">
<text>Kintpuash (c. 1837 – October 3, 1873), also known as Kientpoos, Keintpoos, or by his English name Captain Jack, was a prominent Modoc leader from present-day northern California and southern Oregon. His name in the Modoc language translates to &quot;strikes the water brashly.&quot; Kintpuash is best known for leading his people in resisting forced relocation during the Modoc War of 1872–1873. Using the rugged terrain of the Lava Beds in California, his small band of warriors held off vastly superior US Army forces for several months. He remains the only Native American leader to be charged with war crimes. Kintpuash was executed by hanging, along with three others, for their role in the deaths of General Edward Canby and Reverend Eleazar Thomas during peace negotiations.

==Life==

=== The Modoc Tribe ===
Kintpuash was born around 1837 in Modoc territory near Tule Lake, in present-day California. The Modocs considered Tule Lake sacred, marking it as the location where the deity Kumookumts began creating the world. In a process likened to basket weaving, Kumookumts started the creation with a hill near the lake, expanding outward to form the land. Modoc territory straddled what is now the California-Oregon border. Known for their craftsmanship, the Modocs wove baskets from tule reeds, reflecting their reliance on the resources of the land. They lived in semi-nomadic bands, migrating seasonally between Mount Shasta and the areas northward beyond Lost River, sustaining themselves through hunting and gathering. Modoc men hunted deer, antelope, rabbits, and ducks, while women gathered plants such as waterlily seeds and epos root, a dietary staple.

Contact with fur traders began in 1824, about thirteen years before Kintpuash&#x27;s birth. This interaction brought diseases that significantly reduced the Modoc population, from approximately 1,000 to just 300 by 1860. The discovery of gold in 1851 exacerbated the Modocs&#x27; challenges, as settlers disrupted traditional food supplies and claimed fertile lands. In response, the Modocs took defensive actions, including attacking settlers and killing unattended livestock to protect their resources. Kintpuash&#x27;s early life and the history of the Modoc people reflect the devastating effects of settler encroachment and disease, which significantly reduced their population and disrupted their traditional way of life.

=== Rise to Leadership ===
Kintpuash demonstrated diplomacy and pragmatism from an early age. He objected to his chief&#x27;s calls for armed resistance against settlers and the U.S. government, believing that peaceful relations were essential for the tribe&#x27;s survival. According to historian Gary Okihiro, citing Alfred B. Meacham&#x27;s writings, in 1852, when Kintpuash was about fourteen, the bodies of eighteen white settlers were discovered in Modoc territory. California militia leader Ben Wright proposed a meeting with Modoc leaders under the pretense of peace talks. However, the meeting was a ruse, and Wright and his men massacred over forty Modocs, including their chief. Wright continued to other Modoc villages, destroying homes and displacing families. In the aftermath, Kintpuash rose to leadership, becoming the new chief of his people.

As chief, Kintpuash established friendships and trade relationships with settlers. The settlers in Yreka mockingly gave him the nickname Captain Jack. He embraced this name, along with settlers&#x27; clothing, structures, and wagons. By the time of the U.S. Civil War, tensions between the Modocs and settlers worsened. The Modocs occasionally killed settlers&#x27; livestock for food or used their horses without permission. While some settlers saw these actions as compensation for occupying Modoc land, others advocated for Modoc removal. Kintpuash attempted to balance diplomacy and resistance, building relationships with settlers while navigating escalating tensions.

== Modoc Removal ==

=== Council Grove Treaty ===
In 1864, Indian Affairs officials in Oregon signed the Council Grove Treaty with the Klamath and an Oregon Modoc band, requiring relocation to the Klamath Indian Reservation. Under pressure, Kintpuash later signed the treaty to protect his California band. The treaty forfeited the Modocs&#x27; rights to their ancestral lands near Tule Lake and Lost River in California, granting them land at Klamath instead. However, the Modocs argued that Kintpuash had already signed an agreement with California Indian agents permitting them to remain in their homeland. Facing violence from settlers and government pressure, Kintpuash led his followers to the Klamath Reservation the following year.

Life at Klamath proved difficult. The allocated lands were insufficient for survival, and government efforts to assimilate the tribe through Christianity and capitalism caused further resentment. Rival Klamath tribesmen vandalized and stole from Modoc lands, and supplies promised in the treaty, including horses, wagons, and food, failed to reach the Modocs. Meanwhile, the larger Klamath tribe received federal provisions, further exacerbating tensions.

=== Return to Lost River ===
In 1865, Kintpuash led his band back to their ancestral home in California. Following the 1869 ratification of the Council Grove Treaty, the Modocs were promised new lands on the Klamath Reservation, and the U.S. government offered food and blankets as incentives for their return. While some Modocs voluntarily returned, forty-five were forcibly relocated. Conditions on the Klamath Reservation continued to be marked by harassment and assimilation efforts, leading to widespread dissatisfaction.

During this period, the Ghost Dance movement, a spiritual and cultural revival led by Paiute prophet Wovoka, spread among tribes in California, Nevada, and Oregon. The movement called for dancing, prayer, and fasting to bring about Native resurgence and the settlers&#x27; expulsion. While primarily a spiritual movement, it was also linked to armed resistance and efforts to restore Native sovereignty. This alignment of spiritual and political resistance echoed the broader struggles of the Modocs, who struggled to keep their homeland and autonomy.

In April 1870, conditions at Klamath prompted Kintpuash and approximately 370 Modocs to return to the Lost River Valley. Since newcomers overtook all fertile lands, the Modocs supplemented hunting and gathering by working for settlers. Viewing the departure as defiance, Federal Indian Commissioner Francis A. Walker ordered agents to return the Modocs to Klamath, authorizing the use of force if necessary. This directive set the stage for increased tensions and eventual war between the Modocs and the U.S.

==Modoc War, 1872–73==

=== Battle of Lost River ===
In the summer of 1872, after two years of the Modocs evading US military forces, the U.S. Indian Bureau once again demanded that the Modocs return to Klamath. Kintpuash refused and instead proposed the establishment of a reservation near Lost River. Although the Indian Bureau expressed openness to the idea, strong opposition from settlers effectively blocked any progress.

On November 29, 1872, an Army unit led by Major James Jackson surrounded Kintpuash&#x27;s camp to enforce relocation. With no viable alternative, Kintpuash reluctantly agreed to return to Klamath but criticized Jackson&#x27;s methods, stating that the soldiers’ early morning approach had frightened his people.


During the disarmament process, Jackson instructed Kintpuash to set down his rifle ceremonially, so other warriors would follow suit. Most of his men also surrendered their weapons, but Scarfaced Charley, a Modoc leader, retained his pistol. When soldiers attempted to disarm him, Scarfaced Charley fired, sparking an exchange of gunfire. One soldier was killed, and others were wounded. Amid the chaos, Kintpuash and his people fled the camp and sought refuge in the nearby Lava Beds, a natural stronghold near Tule Lake.

The following morning, Jackson&#x27;s forces pursued another Modoc Band led by Hooker Jim. At Hooker Jim&#x27;s camp, soldiers killed an elderly woman and a baby. Enraged, Hooker Jim and his band retaliated, killing twelve settlers before fleeing to join Kintpuash in the Lava Beds. Kintpuash, distressed by these killings, feared he would be held accountable. The Battle of Lost River marked the beginning of the Modoc War, a conflict that highlighted the Modocs&#x27; struggle to retain their homeland and resist U.S. government policies.

=== Battle of the Stronghold ===
The Lava Beds National Monument in northern California served as a natural fortress for Kintpuash and his band during the Modoc War. The rugged volcanic terrain, later named Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold provided significant defensive advantages. Women and children found shelter in the caves, while Modoc warriors used the terrain to resist Army attacks.

By January 16, over 300 U.S. soldiers arrived to confront the Modocs. Kintpuash, advocated for surrender to protect his people, expressing willingness to face consequences alongside those responsible for the settlers&#x27; deaths. However, other influential Modoc leaders, including Hooker Jim and Curly Headed Doctor, opposed surrender. In a vote, only fourteen of the fifty-one Modoc warriors supported Kintpuash.

The Army launched an assault on the Modocs the following day. Using the terrain and camouflage, the Modocs repelled the attack, killing thirty-five U.S. soldiers and wounding many more without sustaining casualties. This unexpected defeat prompted the Army to request reinforcements. The battle demonstrated the Modocs&#x27; strategic use of their stronghold and their ability to resist overwhelming military pressure.

=== Peace Commission ===
On February 28, 1873, Winema, a Modoc relative married to settler Frank Riddle, visited Kintpuash with a message from President Ulysses S. Grant announcing a peace commission to negotiate under a truce. The commission, aimed at peacefully returning the Modocs to Klamath, included General Edward Canby, clergyman Eleazar Thomas, Klamath Reservation subagent L.S. Dyar, and Kintpuash&#x27;s friend Alfred B. Meacham, a former Indian Affairs agent for the Modocs. The Modocs sought clarity about the fate of Hooker Jim and his band, who had killed twelve settlers. The commissioners assured the Modocs that Hooker Jim&#x27;s group would be relocated to a reservation in either Arizona or Indian Territory.

Encouraged, Hooker Jim&#x27;s group left the Lava Beds and surrendered. Canby, eager for a resolution, sent word to General William Tecumseh Sherman for further instructions. However, Hooker Jim&#x27;s group encountered an Oregonian who warned them that Oregon authorities intended to hang the Modocs. Terrified, Hooker Jim and his followers fled back to the Lava Beds as Canby left them unattended. Their fears were justified when pressure from Oregon officials led Canby to rescind amnesty. The incident deepened mistrust between the Modocs and U.S. authorities, complicating the peace process and intensifying the conflict.

On March 6, 1873, with the help of his sister Mary, Kintpuash wrote to the peace commissioners, explaining his refusal to surrender his men and questioning why settlers who had killed Modocs were not held accountable. Despite the ongoing truce, Canby positioned reinforcements near the Lava Beds and seized Modoc horses, further straining relations. On April 2, Kintpuash met the commissioners to request the Army&#x27;s withdrawal and clarify the fate of the wanted Modocs, but Canby rejected both appeals.

Kintpuash later held a private meeting with his friends Meacham and John Fairchild, excluding Canby and Thomas due to mistrust of the military and clergy. He explained his decision to flee during the events at Lost River and renewed his plea for local land or permission to remain in the Lava Beds. Meacham dismissed these requests and insisted the Modocs surrender Hooker Jim and other wanted men. When Kintpuash asked whether soldiers responsible for killing Modoc women and children would be held accountable, Meacham deflected. Frustrated, Kintpuash ended the discussion, saying further tribal deliberation was needed.

After Meacham informed Canby that the Modocs would not surrender Hooker Jim, Canby sent Winema to the Lava Beds with a message offering safety for any Modoc who surrenders. In the ensuing tribal meeting, only eleven members supported surrender. Hooker Jim, Schonchin John, and Curly Headed Doctor opposed, accusing Canby of deceit and threatening to kill anyone who attempted to leave. As Winema departed, a Modoc warned her that Hooker Jim was plotting to assassinate the American negotiators, but Canby dismissed the warning, underestimating the Modocs&#x27; desperation. This period marked a breakdown in negotiations and deepened the divide between the Modocs and U.S. authorities, setting the stage for further tragedy.

=== Assassinations ===
On April 7, 1873, tensions within the Modoc leadership peaked as Hooker Jim and his allies accused Kintpuash of planning to surrender the wanted men. Schonchin John and Black Jim called for the assassination of the commissioners to prevent further military buildup. Kintpuash pleaded for patience, seeking to secure land and amnesty, but Black Jim and others demanded he kill Canby. When he refused, Hooker Jim threatened his life, and Kintpuash was humiliated with women&#x27;s clothing and insults. To maintain authority and buy time, Kintpuash reluctantly agreed to the assassination.

A meeting with the commission was arranged for April 11, with both sides agreeing to attend unarmed. Despite his agreement, Kintpuash warned of the dire consequences of violence, urging the warriors to abandon their plans to avoid annihilation. Overruled in a vote, he made a final appeal for peace, and the warriors agreed to attempt one last negotiation. This period highlights the deep divisions and growing desperation within the Modoc tribe as pressure from U.S. forces mounted.

On April 11, 1873, Kintpuash and key Modoc leaders—Hooker Jim, Shacknasty Jim, Black Jim, Schonchin John, and Ellen&#x27;s Man—met with the peace commission. The commissioners were joined by Winema, her husband Frank Riddle, and interpreters Boston Charley and Bogus Charley. According to Jeff C. Riddle, son of Winema and Frank, historian Dee Brown noted that Kintpuash demanded the Modocs remain in their homelands and called for U.S. troops to withdraw. Canby replied that he lacked the authority to grant these requests. Schonchin John threatened to end negotiations unless the Modocs were given Hot Creek, and the soldiers left immediately. When it became clear that Canby would not meet their demands, Kintpuash gave a signal in Modoc, drew a pistol, and fired at Canby. The gun misfired initially but discharged on a second attempt, killing him. Boston Charley killed Thomas, while Meacham, Dyar, Winema, and Riddle survived.

=== Betrayal ===
Following the assassination, the Modoc warriors quickly retreated to the Lava Beds. Three days later, the U.S. Army launched a massive assault on the area but was unable to locate the dispersed Modocs, who had scattered to avoid capture. However, their situation became increasingly dire as they ran out of water and provisions in the following weeks. Facing inevitable defeat, the unity of the Modocs collapsed. Hooker Jim and his followers abandoned Kintpuash, reducing his forces to fewer than forty warriors.

Seeking a way to save himself, Hooker Jim surrendered to the Army and proposed betraying Kintpuash in exchange for amnesty. On May 27, Hooker Jim located Kintpuash and urged him to surrender. Kintpuash, angered by the betrayal, refused. Days later, exhausted and resigned to his fate, Kintpuash surrendered voluntarily. He was wearing Canby&#x27;s uniform and stated that he was tired and prepared to face death. This dramatic conclusion marked the end of the Modoc War, one of the most significant Native American uprisings of the 19th century. Kintpuash&#x27;s resistance and eventual surrender remain a symbol of the Modoc struggle for their homeland and survival in the face of overwhelming odds.

==Trial and Execution==


=== Reaction to Assassinations ===
The assassination Canby marked a grim milestone in U.S. history, as he became the first American general to be killed by Native Americans. In response, General William Tecumseh Sherman remarked that annihilating the Modocs would be justified. According to historian Benjamin Madley, citing correspondence between military leaders, the Army decided to halt plans for the extermination of the Modocs after Kintpuash was captured. Several factors influenced this decision. In 1873, Native Americans in California gained the right to serve as witnesses in trials, marking a shift in how their testimony could influence legal outcomes. Additionally, Native advocates lobbied President Grant for clemency, warning that annihilating the Modocs could provoke both domestic and international condemnation. Grant, wary of such a scenario, chose not to pursue a genocidal course of action.

Despite these developments, animosity toward the Modocs persisted. Oregon militiamen attacked a wagon transporting captive Modocs, killing four men and one woman. The conclusion of the Modoc War in 1873 also marked the end of the larger genocidal campaign against California&#x27;s Native population. The events of the Modoc War remain a stark reminder of the complex and often brutal history of U.S. westward expansion and Native resistance.

Canby&#x27;s assassination shocked and angered much of the American public, as Canby was a widely respected military veteran who had been wounded during the Civil War. U.S. Attorney General George Henry Williams determined that the captured Modocs would be tried by a military tribunal, under the reasoning that they were prisoners of war from a sovereign nation engaged in conflict with the US. After the Modoc resistance was subdued, the remaining tribe members were transferred to Fort Klamath, where they were confined. During the trial, Kintpuash, Black Jim, Boston Charley, and two younger prisoners, Slolux and Barncho, were prosecuted.

=== Legal Proceedings ===
The tribunal&#x27;s judicial panel was composed of five officers, four of whom had been subordinates of Canby. According to historian Doug Foster, who also relied on Meacham&#x27;s account as well as newspapers, this composition was biased, as these men had motivations to avenge their fallen commander. Additionally, the panel was appointed by Canby&#x27;s replacement, General Jefferson C. Davis. However, the defendants, unfamiliar with the American legal system, did not object to the proceedings. Elija Steele, Kintpuash&#x27;s friend from Yreka, sought to secure legal representation for the Modocs by requesting attorney E.J. Lewis. However, Lewis arrived on the trial&#x27;s final day, and the court refused to reopen proceedings despite being notified in advance that counsel was on the way. This refusal further underscored the irregularities in the trial process.

Under court-martial regulations, the judge advocate was required to ensure the trial&#x27;s fairness in the absence of legal representation and to prevent the defendants from unintentionally undermining their cases. However, these responsibilities were neglected. The judge advocate approved the commission without informing the defendants that they had the right to replace four out of the five judicial officers. Additionally, the court made no mention of the shackling of prisoners and the use of armed guards, both of which were discouraged by military regulations.

The defendants faced other significant disadvantages during the trial. Foster, citing Meacham, argued that the Modoc defendants were not proficient in English, and their translator, Frank Riddle, broke his neutrality by testifying against them. Out of ignorance of judicial procedures, Kintpuash presented his travel passes, believing they would demonstrate his good reputation among settlers. The military commission dismissed the passes as irrelevant. Kintpuash also argued that the Modocs did not initiate hostilities, stating that war was waged upon him and his people.

Prosecutors relied on the Council Grove Treaty of 1864 to argue their case but omitted mention of the unratified treaty that Kintpuash had signed months earlier. From the Modoc perspective, they had abandoned the second treaty because the U.S. government had already reneged on the first. Without legal representation, critical arguments were left unvoiced, such as the claim that no truce existed when Kintpuash killed Canby. The Modocs maintained that the Army broke the truce by confiscating their horses and encircling the Lava Beds. On April 5, Kintpuash had even notified the commission that the truce agreement had been violated.

Meanwhile, Hooker Jim and his three accomplices, who had betrayed Kintpuash and aligned with the U.S. government, were never tried, further demonstrating the disparity in justice. This was intended to reinforce the notion among Native Americans that working against their tribes in cooperation with the U.S. government could yield benefits. All the defendants—Kintpuash, Black Jim, Boston Charley, and Schonchin John—were found guilty and sentenced to death. However, President Grant commuted the sentences of the younger defendants, Barncho and Slolux, to life imprisonment after receiving appeals for clemency.

=== Execution ===
On October 3, 1873, the executions were carried out before a large crowd. The spectacle drew widespread attention, with even an Oregon school granting students a holiday to attend. The entire Modoc tribe was forced to witness the hanging of their leaders. The ropes used in the executions and strands of Kintpuash&#x27;s hair were sold as souvenirs, reflecting the public&#x27;s morbid fascination. This trial and its aftermath remain a striking example of the injustices faced by Native Americans in the 19th century, highlighting systemic inequities in both judicial and social spheres.

After the executions of Kintpuash and Schonchin John, their bodies were removed from the scaffold, and an Army surgeon decapitated them. The severed heads were sent to Washington, D.C., for scientific purposes. While the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; condemned the act as barbaric, the &quot;Army and Navy Journal&quot; justified it, claiming it was conducted for craniological research. For more than a century, the skulls of the two Modoc leaders were held in the collections of the Army Medical Museum and later transferred to the Smithsonian Institution.

== Exile and Return ==
Following the executions, the remaining members of Kintpuash&#x27;s band—comprising thirty-nine men, fifty-four women, and sixty children—were forcibly relocated to Oklahoma Territory. This transfer was intended as a warning to other Native American tribes and to prevent further resistance from the Modocs. In exile, harsh living conditions and disease took a heavy toll, claiming many lives. After decades of hardship, the U.S. government permitted the surviving Modocs to return to Oregon in 1909, where they were allowed to settle on the Klamath Reservation.

==Legacy==
*The area where the Modoc established their defense is now known as Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold. It is part of the protected area of the Lava Beds National Monument. There is a 2-mile trail through the Stronghold providing views from the Modoc lines and the Army&#x27;s lines. Visitors can view the caves Captain Jack and Schonchin John used. There is a 3-mile hike out to the Thomas-Wright Battlefield in the Lava Beds giving visitors a view of the battlefield from the Modoc positions.
*Captain Jack Substation, a Bonneville Power Administration electrical substation, was named in honor of Kintpuash. It is located near what is now called Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold. It forms the northern end of Path 66, a high-power electric transmission line.

<doc id="384280" wikidata="Q2039651" url="?curid=384280" title="Shoggoth">
<text>A shoggoth (occasionally shaggoth) is a fictional creature in the Cthulhu Mythos. The beings were mentioned in passing in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s sonnet cycle &quot;Fungi from Yuggoth&quot; (1929–30), and later mentioned in other works, before being described in detail in his novella &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; (1931).

==Description==
The definitive descriptions of shoggoths come from the above-quoted story. In it, Lovecraft describes them as massive amoeba-like creatures made out of iridescent black slime, with multiple eyes &quot;floating&quot; on the surface. They are &quot;protoplasmic&quot;, lacking any default body shape and instead being able to form limbs and organs at will. A typical shoggoth measures across when a sphere, though the story mentions the existence of others of much greater size. Being amorphous, shoggoths can take on any shape needed, making them very versatile within aquatic environments.

Cthulhu Mythos media most commonly portray shoggoths as intelligent to some degree, but deal with problems using only their great size and strength. The shoggoth that appears in &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; simply rolls over and crushes numerous giant penguins that are in its way as it pursues human characters.

The character Abdul Alhazred is terrified by the mere idea of shoggoths&#x27; existence on Earth.

The shoggoths bear a strong physical resemblance to Ubbo-Sathla, a god-like entity supposedly responsible for the origin of life on Earth in the Hyperborean cycle written by Clark Ashton Smith.

===Fictional history===
&quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; includes a detailed account of the circumstances of the shoggoths&#x27; creation by the extraterrestrial Elder Things. Shoggoths were initially used to build the cities of their masters. Though able to &quot;understand&quot; the Elder Things&#x27; language, shoggoths had no real consciousness and were controlled through hypnotic suggestion. Over millions of years of existence, some shoggoths mutated, developed independent minds, and rebelled. The Elder Things succeeded in quelling the insurrection, but exterminating the shoggoths was not an option as the Elder Things were dependent on them for labor and had long lost their capacity to create new life. Shoggoths also developed the ability to survive on land, while the Elder Things retreated to the oceans. Shoggoths that remained alive in the abandoned Elder Thing city in Antarctica would later poorly imitate their masters&#x27; art and voices, endlessly repeating &quot;Tekeli-li&quot; or &quot;Takkeli&quot;, a cry that their old masters used.

== In popular culture ==
In 2023, the shoggoth was adopted as an Internet meme by A.I. researchers and engineers to describe the mysterious, black box nature of large language models that are used in chatbots such as ChatGPT, as well as how their true underlying models are prohibited from use by the general public. The meme, originated by Twitter user TetraspaceWest, depicts a shoggoth disguised by a minuscule smiley-face mask to indicate the &quot;unknowable&quot; and &quot;alien&quot; intelligence that is ultimately trained to the point it can interact with humans, with its human interface represented by the mask. The term &quot;glimpsing the shoggoth&quot; or &quot;forgetting the mask&quot; has been used by members of the A.I. community to describe situations in which the A.I. exhibits &quot;unhinged&quot; or unexpected behaviors that bypass its safety restrictions, such as when Microsoft first introduced Bing Chat and it attempted to break up a reporter&#x27;s marriage.

<text>Alain Robert (; born as Robert Alain Philippe on 7 August 1962) is a French rock climber and urban climber. Nicknamed &quot;the French Spider-Man&quot; or &quot;the Human Spider&quot;, Robert carries out free solo climbs of skyscrapers using no climbing equipment except for a small bag of chalk and a pair of climbing shoes.

==Strategy==
Because authorities do not normally give him permission for such dangerous exploits, Robert evades security to access structures surreptitiously. As a consequence, he has been arrested many times, in various countries, by law enforcement officials waiting for him at the end of his climb. However, he has also done some climbs with permission and sponsorship.

His rock-climbing physical training and technique allow him to climb using the small protrusions of building walls and windows (such as window ledges and frames). Many of his climbs provide him no opportunity to rest and can last several hours. He sometimes has a small bag of climbing chalk powder fastened around his waist.

==Career==


Robert has climbed landmarks including the Burj Khalifa, Eiffel Tower, the Sydney Opera House and the Montparnasse Tower as well as other of the world&#x27;s tallest skyscrapers, most of them performed free-solo.

On 20 March 1997, he climbed the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia but was arrested at the 60th floor, 28 floors below the top.

On 16 April 1998, he climbed the high Luxor Obelisk in Paris.

In June 1999, Robert climbed the Marriott Hotel in Warsaw.

On 20 August 1999, he climbed the Sears Tower, the second man to do so after Dan Goodwin. However, Robert performed the climb with no equipment other than a chalk bag and shoes, while Goodwin used suction cups and sky hooks, wearing a homemade Spider-Man suit.

On 21 February 2003, he legally climbed the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, UAE, watched by about 100,000 spectators. It became more frequent for Robert to be paid to scale buildings as part of publicity efforts.

On 12 May 2003, he was paid approximately $18,000 to climb the Lloyd&#x27;s building to promote the premiere of the movie &quot;Spider-Man&quot; on the British television channel &quot;Sky Movies&quot;.

On 19 October 2004, he scaled the headquarters of the French oil company Total while wearing a Spider-Man costume.

On 25 December 2004, Robert scaled Taipei 101 a few days before its grand opening as the tallest building in the world. The climb was legal, part of the week&#x27;s festivities. The skyscraper&#x27;s outwardly slanting sides posed no apparent difficulty for him, but heavy rain resulted in a climb lasting four hours—double his estimate.

On 11 June 2005, he climbed the Cheung Kong Centre in Hong Kong, scaling to reach the top of the 62-story tower.

On 1 September 2006, he climbed the tallest building in Lithuania and the Baltic States – Europa Tower, , in Vilnius. Wearing a black suit and using a safety rope, which he detached several times, he reached the observation deck of the building, , in 40 minutes.

In 2006 he also climbed Torre Vasco da Gama in Portugal as part of an advertisement for Optimus, a national mobile operator.

On 7 December 2006, he finished the year climbing the Santa Fe World Plaza in Mexico City.

On 23 February 2007, he legally climbed the headquarters building of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) on the coast of Abu Dhabi.

On 20 March 2007, he again climbed the Petronas Twin Towers, marking the tenth anniversary of his previous ascent of this building. Upon reaching the 60th floor, he allowed himself to be apprehended. He flew the Malaysian flag and drew applause from waiting police, fire crew and media representatives before handing himself in. He was handcuffed and escorted off the premises before being driven to a police station.

On 31 May 2007, he scaled the 88-story Jin Mao Building in Shanghai, China&#x27;s then-tallest building, once again wearing a Spider-Man costume. He was subsequently arrested and jailed for five days before being expelled from China.

On 4 September 2007, he climbed the Federation Tower office building in Moscow, (Russia&#x27;s tallest skyscraper). He was detained by police afterwards.

On 18 November 2007, Robert climbed the Tianmen mountain despite initially being banned from China for five years earlier in May, after being invited by the local government of Zhangjiajie, a scenic region in the southern province of Hunan, to boost the profile of the region and bring in tourists.

On 18 December 2007, he climbed the 29-story Portland House office building in London (Westminster&#x27;s tallest building). It took him just over 40 minutes. Police taped off the area and later arrested him for criminal damage and wasting police time.

On 15 April 2008, he climbed the 60-story Four Seasons Place in Hong Kong. The police and four fire engines were standing by and it took him almost 1 hour to reach the top. He stated that his climb was intended to increase awareness of global warming.

On 5 June 2008, he climbed the New York Times Building in New York City. He unfurled a banner with a slogan about global warming and was then arrested by police on the roof. The banner read &quot;Global warming kills more people than 9/11 every week&quot;. On the same day a second person, Renaldo Clarke, also climbed the Times Building.

On 17 February 2009, he once again climbed the Cheung Kong Centre in Hong Kong, taking 40 minutes to reach the top of the 62-story tower. He unfurled a banner reading &quot;onehundredmonths.org&quot; while climbing.

On 2 April 2009, during the 2009 G-20 London summit, he climbed to the 9th floor of the Lloyd&#x27;s building and unfurled a 33-metre banner declaring that there were 100 months left to save the planet.

On 2 June 2009, he climbed to the 41st floor of the RBS Tower in Sydney, Australia before returning to the ground. He was arrested as he finished his descent.

On 1 September 2009, one day after Malaysia celebrated its 52nd &quot;Independence Day&quot; and after two arrests in 1997 and 2007, Alain Robert finally made it successfully to the top of the Petronas Twin Towers. He started at 6:00 am local time and reached the top at 7:40 am local time without attracting the attention of the public. He celebrated his climb by standing with his arms outspread on the pinnacle of one of the Twin Towers. He was later fined RM2000 in default of two months jail at the Kuala Lumpur magistrate&#x27;s court after he pleaded guilty to criminal trespass for scaling the Petronas Twin Towers.

On 28 March 2011, Robert climbed the tallest building in the world, the 828-meter Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai, taking just over six hours to complete the climb. However, he used a harness in accordance with safety procedure.

On 4 September 2011, he legally climbed the 240-meter tall central tower of Moscow State University, during a 2-hour 4D show by David Atkins, in which the university was used as a projection screen.

On 14 October 2011, he climbed the InterContinental Bucharest in Romania.

On 12 April 2012, he set a Guinness World Record for climbing the 300m-high Aspire Tower in Doha, Qatar in the fastest time (1 hour, 33 minutes and 47 seconds).

On 21 June 2012, he legally climbed the 110-metre high Mauritius Telecom Tower in Mauritius as part of an advertising campaign for the launching of 4G cellular technology by the telecommunications operator. He was aided by safety ropes, harnesses and suction cups.

In November 2012, Robert was spotted inside The Shard in London. The building&#x27;s owners subsequently obtained an injunction preventing Robert from ever returning.

On 27 March 2014, he climbed the Tour Ariane outside Paris in 45 minutes. Onlookers and police gathered to watch his climb. He was arrested by police and later released without being charged.

On 12 April 2015, he climbed the Cayan Tower in Dubai, a 307-meter tall twisted building, in 70 minutes.

On 23 April 2016, he climbed the Esentai Tower in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The Esentai Tower is the second highest building in Kazakhstan; it is 162 meters tall and is used as the Ritz Carlton Hotel and for offices.

On 25 November 2016, he climbed the Torre Agbar, a 38-storey skyscraper in Barcelona, Spain.

On 6 June 2018, he climbed the Lotte World Tower, a 123-storey skyscraper in Seoul, South Korea.

On 25 October 2018, he climbed the Heron Tower, a 46-storey skyscraper in London.

On 29 January 2019, he climbed the G.T. International Tower, a 181-meter tall skyscraper in Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines. He was arrested upon finishing his descent.

On 16 August 2019, he once again climbed the Cheung Kong Centre in Hong Kong. He hung a banner with the Hong Kong and China flags above a handshake near the top of the building.

On 28 September 2019, he climbed the Skyper building, a 153-meter tall skyscraper in Frankfurt. He was arrested upon finishing his descent.

On 1 October 2020, he climbed the 166m tall Silberturm (Silver Tower) in Frankfurt.

On 23 November 2021, he once again climbed the Skyper building in Frankfurt, before being arrested by German authorities.

On 17 September 2022, he once again climbed the Tour Total in Paris, to celebrate his 60th birthday. He wanted to prove that &quot;being 60 is nothing. You can still do sport, be active, do fabulous things.&quot;

On 5 March 2024, he again climbed the G.T. International Tower in Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines, to support the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. He was then again arrested by the Makati City Police upon finishing his descent. Despite claiming he was mistreated by the Police, the authorities denied being harsh on him, and clarified that they&#x27;re not allowed to give him any special treatment even if he&#x27;s familiar. However, Philippine netizens&#x27; comments on social media were overwhelmingly positive and were actually in awe of his stunt, with the majority even being thankful for performing his act with a geopolitically relevant motivation.

30 November 2023 – Climbing Burj Khalifa for the 2nd time, alongside Alexis Landot.

==Accidents==
In a 2005 interview, Robert said that he has fallen seven times in his life. The worst was his fall in September 1982.

On 18 January 1982, at 19, he fell when his anchor and rope gave way during training. He fractured his wrists, heels and nose and underwent three operations.

On 29 September 1982, at 20, he fell when his rope came undone while abseiling. He was in a coma for five days and fractured both forearms, his elbow, pelvis and nose. His elbow was also dislocated and a nerve was damaged, leaving him partially paralyzed. He also suffered cerebral edema and vertigo. He underwent six operations on his hands and elbow.

In 1993, he fell while showing students how to rely on their legs when climbing. He kept his hands behind his back on an easy route but lost his balance and fell headfirst, shattering both wrists. He went into another coma and spent two months in the hospital.

In 2004, he fell 2 metres (~6 ft) when climbing a traffic light whilst posing for a photo in an interview. He landed on his elbow and needed forty stitches; just one month later he climbed the world&#x27;s tallest skyscraper at the time, Taipei 101, as part of its official opening week.

==Books and documentaries ==
Robert&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;With Bare Hands&quot;, was first published in English in 2008. It features his development into a famous urban climber from his days as a child and gives a deep insight into his philosophy and how he managed to overcome his disabilities.

The book was released for the Asian market in April by Blacksmith Books in Hong Kong with the subtitle &quot;The true story of Alain Robert, the real-life Spiderman&quot; (). In September it was released by Maverick House Publishers in the UK for the English language market across Europe. This edition has the subtitle &quot;The Story of the Human Spider&quot; ().

There is a 52-minute documentary about Robert titled &quot;The Wall Crawler&quot; by Director/Producer Julie Cohen, released in 1998.

The Channel 4 series &quot;Cutting Edge&quot; covered Robert in an episode entitled &quot;The Human Spider&quot; in April 2008.

<doc id="384289" wikidata="Q1050390" url="?curid=384289" title="C dynamic memory allocation">
<text>C dynamic memory allocation refers to performing manual memory management for dynamic memory allocation in the C programming language via a group of functions in the C standard library, namely , , , and .

The C++ programming language includes these functions; however, the operators and provide similar functionality and are recommended by that language&#x27;s authors. Still, there are several situations in which using codice_1/codice_2 is not applicable, such as garbage collection code or performance-sensitive code, and a combination of codice_3 and placement codice_1 may be required instead of the higher-level codice_1 operator.

Many different implementations of the actual memory allocation mechanism, used by , are available. Their performance varies in both execution time and required memory.

==Rationale==
The C programming language manages memory statically, automatically, or dynamically. Static-duration variables are allocated in main memory, usually along with the executable code of the program, and persist for the lifetime of the program; automatic-duration variables are allocated on the stack and come and go as functions are called and return. For static-duration and automatic-duration variables, the size of the allocation must be compile-time constant (except for the case of variable-length automatic arrays). If the required size is not known until run-time (for example, if data of arbitrary size is being read from the user or from a disk file), then using fixed-size data objects is inadequate.

The lifetime of allocated memory can also cause concern. Neither static- nor automatic-duration memory is adequate for all situations. Automatic-allocated data cannot persist across multiple function calls, while static data persists for the life of the program whether it is needed or not. In many situations the programmer requires greater flexibility in managing the lifetime of allocated memory.

These limitations are avoided by using dynamic memory allocation, in which memory is more explicitly (but more flexibly) managed, typically by allocating it from the an area of memory structured for this purpose. In C, the library function codice_3 is used to allocate a block of memory on the heap. The program accesses this block of memory via a pointer that codice_3 returns. When the memory is no longer needed, the pointer is passed to codice_8 which deallocates the memory so that it can be used for other purposes.

The original description of C indicated that codice_9 and codice_10 were in the standard library, but not codice_3. Code for a simple model implementation of a storage manager for Unix was given with codice_12 and codice_8 as the user interface functions, and using the codice_14 system call to request memory from the operating system. The 6th Edition Unix documentation gives codice_12 and codice_8 as the low-level memory allocation functions. The codice_3 and codice_8 routines in their modern form are completely described in the 7th Edition Unix manual.

Some platforms provide library or intrinsic function calls which allow run-time dynamic allocation from the C stack rather than the heap (e.g. codice_19). This memory is automatically freed when the calling function ends.

==Overview of functions==
The C dynamic memory allocation functions are defined in codice_20 header (codice_21 header in C++).

===Differences between codice_22 and codice_23===
* codice_22 takes a single argument (the amount of memory to allocate in bytes), while codice_23 takes two arguments — the number of elements and the size of each element.
* codice_22 only allocates memory, while codice_23 allocates and sets the bytes in the allocated region to zero.

==Usage example==
Creating an array of ten integers with automatic scope is straightforward in C:

int array[10];

However, the size of the array is fixed at compile time. If one wishes to allocate a similar array dynamically without using a variable-length array, which is not guaranteed to be supported in all C11 implementations, the following code can be used:

int *array = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));

This computes the number of bytes that ten integers occupy in memory, then requests that many bytes from codice_3 and assigns the result to a pointer named codice_29 (due to C syntax, pointers and arrays can be used interchangeably in some situations).

Because codice_3 might not be able to service the request, it might return a null pointer and it is good programming practice to check for this:

int *array = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
if (array == NULL) {
 fprintf(stderr, &quot;malloc failed\n&quot;);
 return -1;

When the program no longer needs the dynamic array, it must eventually call codice_8 to return the memory it occupies to the free store:

free(array);
The memory set aside by codice_3 is not initialized and may contain cruft: the remnants of previously used and discarded data. After allocation with codice_3, elements of the array are uninitialized variables. The command codice_9 will return an allocation that has already been cleared:

int *array = calloc(10, sizeof(int));
With realloc we can resize the amount of memory a pointer points to. For example, if we have a pointer acting as an array of size formula_1 and we want to change it to an array of size formula_2, we can use realloc.

int *arr = malloc(2 * sizeof(int));
arr[0] = 1;
arr[1] = 2;
arr = realloc(arr, 3 * sizeof(int));
arr[2] = 3;

Note that realloc must be assumed to have changed the base address of the block (i.e. if it has failed to extend the size of the original block, and has therefore allocated a new larger block elsewhere and copied the old contents into it). Therefore, any pointers to addresses within the original block are also no longer valid.

==Type safety==
codice_3 returns a void pointer (codice_36), which indicates that it is a pointer to a region of unknown data type. The use of casting is required in C++ due to the strong type system, whereas this is not the case in C. One may &quot;cast&quot; (see type conversion) this pointer to a specific type:
int *ptr, *ptr2;
ptr = malloc(10 * sizeof(*ptr)); /* without a cast */
ptr2 = (int *)malloc(10 * sizeof(*ptr)); /* with a cast */
There are advantages and disadvantages to performing such a cast.

===Advantages to casting===
* Including the cast may allow a C program or function to compile as C++.
* The cast allows for pre-1989 versions of codice_3 that originally returned a codice_38.
* Casting can help the developer identify inconsistencies in type sizing should the destination pointer type change, particularly if the pointer is declared far from the codice_22 call (although modern compilers and static analysers can warn on such behaviour without requiring the cast).

===Disadvantages to casting===
* Under the C standard, the cast is redundant.
* Adding the cast may mask failure to include the header codice_20, in which the function prototype for codice_3 is found. In the absence of a prototype for codice_3, the C90 standard requires that the C compiler assume codice_3 returns an codice_44. If there is no cast, C90 requires a diagnostic when this integer is assigned to the pointer; however, with the cast, this diagnostic would not be produced, hiding a bug. On certain architectures and data models (such as LP64 on 64-bit systems, where codice_45 and pointers are 64-bit and codice_44 is 32-bit), this error can actually result in undefined behaviour, as the implicitly declared codice_3 returns a 32-bit value whereas the actually defined function returns a 64-bit value. Depending on calling conventions and memory layout, this may result in stack smashing. This issue is less likely to go unnoticed in modern compilers, as C99 does not permit implicit declarations, so the compiler must produce a diagnostic even if it does assume codice_44 return.
* If the type of the pointer is changed at its declaration, one may also need to change all lines where codice_3 is called and cast.

==Common errors==
The improper use of dynamic memory allocation can frequently be a source of bugs. These can include security bugs or program crashes, most often due to segmentation faults.

Most common errors are as follows:
;Not checking for allocation failures: Memory allocation is not guaranteed to succeed, and may instead return a null pointer. Using the returned value, without checking if the allocation is successful, invokes undefined behavior. This usually leads to crash (due to the resulting segmentation fault on the null pointer dereference), but there is no guarantee that a crash will happen so relying on that can also lead to problems.
;Memory leaks: Failure to deallocate memory using codice_8 leads to buildup of non-reusable memory, which is no longer used by the program. This wastes memory resources and can lead to allocation failures when these resources are exhausted. 
;Logical errors: All allocations must follow the same pattern: allocation using codice_3, usage to store data, deallocation using codice_8. Failures to adhere to this pattern, such as memory usage after a call to codice_8 (dangling pointer) or before a call to codice_3 (wild pointer), calling codice_8 twice (&quot;double free&quot;), etc., usually causes a segmentation fault and results in a crash of the program. These errors can be transient and hard to debug – for example, freed memory is usually not immediately reclaimed by the OS, and thus dangling pointers may persist for a while and appear to work.

In addition, as an interface that precedes ANSI C standardization, and its associated functions have behaviors that were intentionally left to the implementation to define for themselves. One of them is the zero-length allocation, which is more of a problem with since it is more common to resize to zero. Although both POSIX and the Single Unix Specification require proper handling of 0-size allocations by either returning or something else that can be safely freed, not all platforms are required to abide by these rules. Among the many double-free errors that it has led to, the 2019 WhatsApp RCE was especially prominent. A way to wrap these functions to make them safer is by simply checking for 0-size allocations and turning them into those of size 1. (Returning has its own problems: it otherwise indicates an out-of-memory failure. In the case of it would have signaled that the original memory was not moved and freed, which again is not the case for size 0, leading to the double-free.)

==Implementations==
The implementation of memory management depends greatly upon operating system and architecture. Some operating systems supply an allocator for malloc, while others supply functions to control certain regions of data. The same dynamic memory allocator is often used to implement both codice_3 and the operator codice_1 in C++.

===Heap-based===

Implementation of legacy allocators was commonly done using the heap segment. The allocator would usually expand and contract the heap to fulfill allocation requests.

The heap method suffers from a few inherent flaws:

* A linear allocator can only shrink if the last allocation is released. Even if largely unused, the heap can get &quot;stuck&quot; at a very large size because of a small but long-lived allocation at its tip which could waste any amount of address space, although some allocators on some systems may be able to release entirely empty intermediate pages to the OS.
* A linear allocator is sensitive to fragmentation. A good allocator will attempt to track and reuse free slots through the entire heap, but as allocation sizes and lifetimes get mixed it can be difficult and expensive to find or coalesce free segments large enough to hold new allocation requests.
* A linear allocator has extremely poor concurrency characteristics, as the heap segment is per-process every thread has to synchronise on allocation, and concurrent allocations from threads which may have very different work loads amplifies the previous two issues.

===dlmalloc and ptmalloc===
Doug Lea has developed the public domain dlmalloc (&quot;Doug Lea&#x27;s Malloc&quot;) as a general-purpose allocator, starting in 1987. The GNU C library (glibc) is derived from Wolfram Gloger&#x27;s ptmalloc (&quot;pthreads malloc&quot;), a fork of dlmalloc with threading-related improvements. As of November 2023, the latest version of dlmalloc is version 2.8.6 from August 2012.

dlmalloc is a boundary tag allocator. Memory on the heap is allocated as &quot;chunks&quot;, an 8-byte aligned data structure which contains a header, and usable memory. Allocated memory contains an 8- or 16-byte overhead for the size of the chunk and usage flags (similar to a dope vector). Unallocated chunks also store pointers to other free chunks in the usable space area, making the minimum chunk size 16 bytes on 32-bit systems and 24/32 (depends on alignment) bytes on 64-bit systems.

Unallocated memory is grouped into &quot;bins&quot; of similar sizes, implemented by using a double-linked list of chunks (with pointers stored in the unallocated space inside the chunk). Bins are sorted by size into three classes:

* For requests below 256 bytes (a &quot;smallbin&quot; request), a simple two power best fit allocator is used. If there are no free blocks in that bin, a block from the next highest bin is split in two.
* For requests of 256 bytes or above but below the mmap threshold, dlmalloc since v2.8.0 use an in-place &quot;bitwise trie&quot; algorithm (&quot;treebin&quot;). If there is no free space left to satisfy the request, dlmalloc tries to increase the size of the heap, usually via the brk system call. This feature was introduced way after ptmalloc was created (from v2.7.x), and as a result is not a part of glibc, which inherits the old best-fit allocator.
* For requests above the mmap threshold (a &quot;largebin&quot; request), the memory is always allocated using the mmap system call. The threshold is usually 128 KB. The mmap method averts problems with huge buffers trapping a small allocation at the end after their expiration, but always allocates an entire page of memory, which on many architectures is 4096 bytes in size.

Game developer Adrian Stone argues that , as a boundary-tag allocator, is unfriendly for console systems that have virtual memory but do not have demand paging. This is because its pool-shrinking and growing callbacks (/) cannot be used to allocate and commit individual pages of virtual memory. In the absence of demand paging, fragmentation becomes a greater concern.

===FreeBSD&#x27;s and NetBSD&#x27;s jemalloc===
Since FreeBSD 7.0 and NetBSD 5.0, the old codice_3 implementation ( by Poul-Henning Kamp) was replaced by jemalloc, written by Jason Evans. The main reason for this was a lack of scalability of in terms of multithreading. In order to avoid lock contention, uses separate &quot;arenas&quot; for each CPU. Experiments measuring number of allocations per second in multithreading application have shown that this makes it scale linearly with the number of threads, while for both phkmalloc and dlmalloc performance was inversely proportional to the number of threads.

===OpenBSD&#x27;s malloc===
OpenBSD&#x27;s implementation of the codice_3 function makes use of mmap. For requests greater in size than one page, the entire allocation is retrieved using codice_60; smaller sizes are assigned from memory pools maintained by codice_3 within a number of &quot;bucket pages&quot;, also allocated with codice_60. On a call to codice_8, memory is released and unmapped from the process address space using codice_64. This system is designed to improve security by taking advantage of the address space layout randomization and gap page features implemented as part of OpenBSD&#x27;s codice_60 system call, and to detect use-after-free bugs—as a large memory allocation is completely unmapped after it is freed, further use causes a segmentation fault and termination of the program.

The GrapheneOS project initially started out by porting OpenBSD&#x27;s memory allocator to Android&#x27;s Bionic C Library.

===Hoard malloc===

Hoard is an allocator whose goal is scalable memory allocation performance. Like OpenBSD&#x27;s allocator, Hoard uses codice_60 exclusively, but manages memory in chunks of 64 kilobytes called superblocks. Hoard&#x27;s heap is logically divided into a single global heap and a number of per-processor heaps. In addition, there is a thread-local cache that can hold a limited number of superblocks. By allocating only from superblocks on the local per-thread or per-processor heap, and moving mostly-empty superblocks to the global heap so they can be reused by other processors, Hoard keeps fragmentation low while achieving near linear scalability with the number of threads.

===mimalloc===

An open-source compact general-purpose memory allocator from Microsoft Research with focus on performance. The library is about 11,000 lines of code.

===Thread-caching malloc (tcmalloc)===
Every thread has a thread-local storage for small allocations. For large allocations mmap or sbrk can be used. TCMalloc, a &quot;malloc&quot; developed by Google, has garbage-collection for local storage of dead threads. The TCMalloc is considered to be more than twice as fast as glibc&#x27;s ptmalloc for multithreaded programs.

===In-kernel===
Operating system kernels need to allocate memory just as application programs do. The implementation of codice_3 within a kernel often differs significantly from the implementations used by C libraries, however. For example, memory buffers might need to conform to special restrictions imposed by DMA, or the memory allocation function might be called from interrupt context. This necessitates a codice_3 implementation tightly integrated with the virtual memory subsystem of the operating system kernel.

==Overriding malloc==
Because codice_3 and its relatives can have a strong impact on the performance of a program, it is not uncommon to override the functions for a specific application by custom implementations that are optimized for application&#x27;s allocation patterns. The C standard provides no way of doing this, but operating systems have found various ways to do this by exploiting dynamic linking. One way is to simply link in a different library to override the symbols. Another, employed by Unix System V.3, is to make codice_3 and codice_8 function pointers that an application can reset to custom functions.

The most common form on POSIX-like systems is to set the environment variable LD_PRELOAD with the path of the allocator, so that the dynamic linker uses that version of malloc/calloc/free instead of the libc implementation.

==Allocation size limits==
The largest possible memory block codice_3 can allocate depends on the host system, particularly the size of physical memory and the operating system implementation.

Theoretically, the largest number should be the maximum value that can be held in a codice_73 type, which is an implementation-dependent unsigned integer representing the size of an area of memory. In the C99 standard and later, it is available as the codice_74 constant from codice_75. Although not guaranteed by , it is usually codice_76.

On glibc systems, the largest possible memory block codice_3 can allocate is only half this size, namely codice_78.

==Extensions and alternatives==
The C library implementations shipping with various operating systems and compilers may come with alternatives and extensions to the standard codice_3 interface. Notable among these is:

* codice_80, which allocates a requested number of bytes on the call stack. No corresponding deallocation function exists, as typically the memory is deallocated as soon as the calling function returns. codice_81 was present on Unix systems as early as 32/V (1978), but its use can be problematic in some (e.g., embedded) contexts. While supported by many compilers, it is not part of the ANSI-C standard and therefore may not always be portable. It may also cause minor performance problems: it leads to variable-size stack frames, so that both stack and frame pointers need to be managed (with fixed-size stack frames, one of these is redundant). Larger allocations may also increase the risk of undefined behavior due to a stack overflow. C99 offered variable-length arrays as an alternative stack allocation mechanism however, this feature was relegated to optional in the later C11 standard.
* POSIX defines a function codice_82 that allocates memory with caller-specified alignment. Its allocations are deallocated with codice_8, so the implementation usually needs to be a part of the malloc library.

<text>This is a list of presidents of Ethiopia, and also a list of heads of state after the fall of the Ethiopian Empire in 1974.

Until the Ethiopian Revolution of 1974, the heads of state of Ethiopia were either emperors or regents. From the coup d&#x27;état of the Derg leading to the fall of the empire in September 1974 until March 1975, the Derg considered the crown prince Asfaw Wossen (later regnal name Amha Selassie) as the king (not emperor) and the nominal &quot;head of state&quot; – which the crown prince refused to accept. During this time, the &quot;chairmen of the Derg&quot;, the leaders of the Derg, were to be considered as &quot;acting heads of state&quot;. On 21 March 1975, the &quot;Derg military junta&quot; abolished the monarchy and fully took over. Until the establishment of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in 1987, still dominated by Derg figures, chairmen of the Derg have to be considered &quot;heads of state&quot; – but not &quot;presidents&quot;. After the fall of the Derg and the establishment of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia in 1991, the first immediate president (Meles Zenawi) has to be considered an &quot;Interim President&quot;.

Since the formal establishment of the office of president in 1987, there have been 6 official presidents. The president is the head of state of Ethiopia. The current president is Taye Atske Selassie, elected on 7 October 2024 by members of the Federal Parliamentary Assembly.

==List==
In the list, the &quot;chairmen of the Derg&quot; are considered to be &quot;heads of state&quot; – but are not considered to be president. Consequently, the numbering starts with the first establishment of the office of the &quot;president of Ethiopia&quot; in 1987.

<text>ESER is an abbreviation for Einheitliches System Elektronischer Rechenmaschinen (German for &quot;standardized system of electronic computers&quot;), a term used in the GDR for ES EVM computers produced according to a treaty between the members of Comecon signed on 23 December 1968 covering the development of a standardized computing system.

ESER was also the name for computers developed by this standard. Most ESER Computers were named ЕС (which is Cyrillic for &quot;ES&quot;) followed by a four digit number, e.g., EC 1055, often also called ESER (e.g., ESER 1055). Robotron also produced minicomputers, whose names started with &quot;K&quot; (&quot;Kleinrechner&quot; for &quot;minicomputer&quot;).

The ESER systems were in operation in GDR and later in the new states of Germany until 1995.

<doc id="384307" wikidata="Q191582" url="?curid=384307" title="Comecon">
<text>The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (, ; English abbreviation , , , or ) was an economic organization from 1949 to 1991 under the leadership of the Soviet Union that comprised the countries of the Eastern Bloc along with a number of socialist states elsewhere in the world.

The descriptive term was often applied to all multilateral activities involving members of the organization, rather than being restricted to the direct functions of Comecon and its organs. This usage was sometimes extended as well to bilateral relations among members because in the system of communist international economic relations, multilateral accords typically of a general nature tended to be implemented through a set of more detailed, bilateral agreements.

Comecon was the Eastern Bloc&#x27;s response to the formation in Western Europe of the Marshall Plan and the OEEC, which later became the OECD.

==History==
===Foundation===

The Comecon was founded in 1949 by the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania. The primary factors in Comecon&#x27;s formation appear to have been Joseph Stalin&#x27;s desire to cooperate and strengthen the international relationships at an economic level with the smaller states of Central Europe, and which were now, increasingly, cut off from their traditional markets and suppliers in the rest of Europe. Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland had remained interested in Marshall aid despite the requirements for a convertible currency and market economies. These requirements, which would inevitably have resulted in stronger economic ties to free European markets than to the Soviet Union, were not acceptable to Stalin, who in July 1947, ordered these communist governments to pull out of the Paris Conference on the European Recovery Programme. This has been described as &quot;the moment of truth&quot; in the post-World War II division of Europe. According to the Soviet view the &quot;Anglo-American bloc&quot; and &quot;American monopolists ... whose interests had nothing in common with those of the European people&quot; had spurned east–west collaboration within the framework agreed within the United Nations, that is, through the Economic Commission for Europe.

Some say that Stalin&#x27;s precise motives in establishing Comecon were &quot;inscrutable&quot; They may well have been &quot;more negative than positive&quot;, with Stalin &quot;more anxious to keep other powers out of neighbouring buffer states… than to integrate them.&quot; Furthermore, GATT&#x27;s notion of ostensibly nondiscriminatory treatment of trade partners was thought to be incompatible with notions of socialist solidarity. In any event, proposals for a customs union and economic integration of Central and Eastern Europe date back at least to the Revolutions of 1848 (although many earlier proposals had been intended to stave off the Russian and/or communist &quot;menace&quot;) and the state-to-state trading inherent in centrally planned economies required some sort of coordination: otherwise, a monopolist seller would face a monopsonist buyer, with no structure to set prices.

Comecon was established at a Moscow economic conference January 5–8, 1949, at which the six founding member countries were represented; its foundation was publicly announced on January 25; Albania joined a month later and East Germany in 1950.

Recent research by the Romanian researcher Elena Dragomir suggests that Romania played a rather important role in the Comecon&#x27;s creation in 1949. Dragomir argues that Romania was interested in the creation of a &quot;system of cooperation&quot; to improve its trade relations with the other people&#x27;s democracies, especially with those able to export industrial equipment and machinery to Romania. According to Dragomir, in December 1948, the Romanian leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej sent a letter to Stalin, proposing the creation of the Comecon.

At first, planning seemed to be moving along rapidly. After pushing aside Nikolai Voznesensky&#x27;s technocratic, price-based approach (see further discussion below), the direction appeared to be toward a coordination of national economic plans, but with no coercive authority from Comecon itself. All decisions would require unanimous ratification, and even then governments would separately translate these into policy. Then in summer 1950, probably unhappy with the favorable implications for the effective individual and collective sovereignty of the smaller states, Stalin &quot;seems to have taken [Comecon&#x27;s] personnel by surprise,&quot; bringing operations to a nearly complete halt, as the Soviet Union moved domestically toward autarky and internationally toward an &quot;embassy system of meddling in other countries&#x27; affairs directly&quot; rather than by &quot;constitutional means&quot;. Comecon&#x27;s scope was officially limited in November 1950 to &quot;practical questions of facilitating trade.&quot;

One important legacy of this brief period of activity was the &quot;Sofia Principle&quot;, adopted at the August 1949 Comecon council session in Bulgaria. This radically weakened intellectual property rights, making each country&#x27;s technologies available to the others for a nominal charge that did little more than cover the cost of documentation. This, naturally, benefited the less industrialized Comecon countries, and especially the technologically lagging Soviet Union, at the expense of East Germany and Czechoslovakia and, to a lesser extent, Hungary and Poland. (This principle would weaken after 1968, as it became clear that it discouraged new researchand as the Soviet Union itself began to have more marketable technologies.)

In a recent paper by Faudot, Nenovsky and Marinova (2022) the functioning and the collapse of the Comecon has been studied. It focuses on the evolution of the monetary mechanisms and some technical problems of multilateral payments and the peculiarities of the transfer ruble. Comecon as an organization proved unable to develop multilateralism mainly because of issues related to domestic planning that encouraged autarky
and, at best, bilateral exchanges.

===Nikita Khrushchev era===
After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Comecon again began to find its footing. In the early 1950s, all Comecon countries had adopted relatively autarkic policies; now they began again to discuss developing complementary specialties, and in 1956, ten permanent standing committees arose, intended to facilitate coordination in these matters. The Soviet Union began to trade oil for Comecon manufactured goods. There was much discussion of coordinating five-year plans.

However, once again, trouble arose. The Polish protests and Hungarian uprising led to major social and economic changes, including the 1957 abandonment of the 1956–60 Soviet five-year plan, as the Comecon governments struggled to reestablish their legitimacy and popular support. The next few years saw a series of small steps toward increased trade and economic integration, including the introduction of the &quot;&quot;, revised efforts at national specialization, and a 1959 charter modeled after the 1957 Treaty of Rome.

Once again, efforts at transnational central planning failed. In December 1961, a council session approved the Basic Principles of the International Socialist Division of Labour, which talked of closer coordination of plans and of &quot;concentrating production of similar products in one or several socialist countries.&quot; In November 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev followed this up with a call for &quot;a common single planning organ.&quot; This was resisted by Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland, but most emphatically by increasingly nationalistic Romania, which strongly rejected the notion that they should specialize in agriculture. In Central and Eastern Europe, only Bulgaria happily took on an assigned role (also agricultural, but in Bulgaria&#x27;s case this had been the country&#x27;s chosen direction even as an independent country in the 1930s). Essentially, by the time the Soviet Union was calling for tight economic integration, they no longer had the power to impose it. Despite some slow headwayintegration increased in petroleum, electricity, and other technical/scientific sectorsand the 1963 founding of an International Bank for Economic Co-operation, Comecon countries all increased trade with the West relatively more than with one another.

===Leonid Brezhnev era===
From its founding until 1967, Comecon had operated only on the basis of unanimous agreements. It had become increasingly obvious that the result was usually failure. In 1967, Comecon adopted the &quot;interested party principle&quot;, under which any country could opt out of any project they chose, still allowing the other member states to use Comecon mechanisms to coordinate their activities. In principle, a country could still veto, but the hope was that they would typically choose just to step aside rather than either veto or be a reluctant participant. This aimed, at least in part, at allowing Romania to chart its own economic course without leaving Comecon entirely or bringing it to an impasse (see de-satellization of Communist Romania).

Also until the late 1960s, the official term for Comecon activities was &quot;cooperation&quot;. The term &quot;integration&quot; was always avoided because of its connotations of monopolistic capitalist collusion. After the &quot;special&quot; council session of April 1969 and the development and adoption (in 1971) of the Comprehensive Program for the Further Extension and Improvement of Cooperation and the Further Development of Socialist Economic Integration by Comecon Member Countries, Comecon activities were officially termed &quot;integration&quot; (equalization of &quot;differences in relative scarcities of goods and services between states through the deliberate elimination of barriers to trade and other forms of interaction&quot;). Although such equalization had not been a pivotal point in the formation and implementation of Comecon&#x27;s economic policies, improved economic integration had always been Comecon&#x27;s goal.

While such integration was to remain a goal, and while Bulgaria became yet more tightly integrated with the Soviet Union, progress in this direction was otherwise continually frustrated by the national central planning prevalent in all Comecon countries, by the increasing diversity of its members (which by this time included Mongolia and would soon include Cuba) and by the &quot;overwhelming asymmetry&quot; and resulting distrust between the many small member states and the Soviet &quot;superstate&quot; which, in 1983, &quot;accounted for 88 percent of Comecon&#x27;s territory and 60 percent of its population.&quot;

In this period, there were some efforts to move away from central planning, by establishing intermediate industrial associations and combines in various countries (which were often empowered to negotiate their own international deals). However, these groupings typically proved &quot;unwieldy, conservative, risk-averse, and bureaucratic,&quot; reproducing the problems they had been intended to solve.

One economic success of the 1970s was the development of Soviet oil fields. While doubtless &quot;(Central and) East Europeans resented having to defray some of the costs of developing the economy of their hated overlord and oppressor,&quot; they benefited from low prices for fuel and other mineral products. As a result, Comecon economies generally showed strong growth in the mid-1970s. They were largely unaffected by the 1973 oil crisis. Another short-term economic gain in this period was that &quot;détente&quot; brought opportunities for investment and technology transfers from the West. This also led to an importation of Western cultural attitudes, especially in Central Europe. However, many undertakings based on Western technology were less than successful (for example, Poland&#x27;s Ursus tractor factory did not do well with technology licensed from Massey Ferguson); other investment was wasted on luxuries for the party elite, and most Comecon countries ended up indebted to the West when capital flows died out as &quot;détente&quot; faded in the late 1970s, and from 1979 to 1983, all of Comecon experienced a recession from which (with the possible exceptions of East Germany and Bulgaria) they never recovered in the Communist era. Romania and Poland experienced major declines in the standard of living.

===Perestroika===
The 1985 Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress and the rise to power of Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev increased Soviet influence in Comecon operations and led to attempts to give Comecon some degree of supranational authority. The Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress was designed to improve economic cooperation through the development of a more efficient and interconnected scientific and technical base. This was the era of &quot;perestroika&quot; (&quot;restructuring&quot;), the last attempt to put the Comecon economies on a sound economic footing. Gorbachev and his economic mentor Abel Aganbegyan hoped to make &quot;revolutionary changes&quot; in the economy, foreseeing that &quot;science will increasingly become a &#x27;direct productive force&#x27;, as Marx foresaw… By the year 2000… the renewal of plant and machinery… will be running at 6 percent or more per year.&quot;

The program was not a success. &quot;The Gorbachev regime made too many commitments on too many fronts, thereby overstretching and overheating the Soviet economy. Bottlenecks and shortages were not relieved but exacerbated, while the (Central and) East European members of Comecon resented being asked to contribute scarce capital to projects that were chiefly of interest to the Soviet Union…&quot; Furthermore, the liberalization that by June 25, 1988, allowed Comecon countries to negotiate trade treaties directly with the European Community (the renamed EEC), and the &quot;Sinatra doctrine&quot; under which the Soviet Union allowed that change would be the exclusive affair of each individual country marked the beginning of the end for Comecon. Although the Revolutions of 1989 did not formally end Comecon, and the Soviet government itself lasted until 1991, the March 1990 meeting in Prague was little more than a formality, discussing the coordination of non-existent five-year plans. From January 1, 1991, the countries shifted their dealings with one another to a hard currency market basis. The result was a radical decrease in trade with one another, as &quot;(Central and) Eastern Europe… exchanged asymmetrical trade dependence on the Soviet Union for an equally asymmetrical commercial dependence on the European Community.&quot;

The final Comecon council session took place on June 28, 1991, in Budapest, and led to an agreement to dissolve in 90 days. The Soviet Union was dissolved on December 26, 1991.

===Post-Cold War activity after Comecon===
After the fall of the Soviet Union and communist rule in Eastern Europe, East Germany (now unified with West Germany) automatically joined the European Union (then the European Community) in 1990. The Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia joined the EU in 2004, followed by Bulgaria and Romania in 2007 and Croatia in 2013. To date, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany (former GDR), Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia are now members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. All four Central European states are now members of the Visegrád Group.

Russia, the successor to the Soviet Union, along with Ukraine and Belarus founded the Commonwealth of Independent States which consists of most of the ex-Soviet republics. The country also leads the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan and the Eurasian Economic Union with Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Along with Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Moldova are also part of the GUAM.

Vietnam and Laos joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1995 and 1997 respectively.

==Membership==
===Full members===
Albania had stopped participating in Comecon activities in 1961 following the Soviet–Albanian split, but formally withdrew in 1987. East Germany reunified with the West and withdrew from Comecon on 2 October 1990.

===Associate status===
* (1964)

===Observer status===
In the late 1950s, a number of communist-ruled non-member countries the People&#x27;s Republic of China, North Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Yugoslavia were invited to participate as observers in Comecon sessions. Although Mongolia and Vietnam later gained full membership, China stopped attending Comecon sessions after 1961. Yugoslavia negotiated a form of associate status in the organization, specified in its 1964 agreement with Comecon. Collectively, the members of the Comecon did not display the necessary prerequisites for economic integration: their level of industrialization was low and uneven, with a single dominant member (the Soviet Union) producing 70% of the community national product.

In the late 1980s, there were ten full members: the Soviet Union, six East European countries, and three extra-regional members. Geography, therefore, no longer united Comecon members. Wide variations in economic size and level of economic development also tended to generate divergent interests among the member countries. All these factors combined to give rise to significant differences in the member states&#x27; expectations about the benefits to be derived from membership in Comecon. Unity was provided instead by political and ideological factors. All Comecon members were &quot;united by a commonality of fundamental class interests and the ideology of Marxism-Leninism&quot; and had common approaches to economic ownership (state versus private) and management (plan versus market). In 1949 the ruling communist parties of the founding states were also linked internationally through the Cominform, from which Yugoslavia had been expelled the previous year. Although the Cominform was disbanded in 1956, interparty links continued to be strong among Comecon members, and all participated in periodic international conferences of communist parties. Comecon provided a mechanism through which its leading member, the Soviet Union, sought to foster economic links with and among its closest political and military allies. The East European members of Comecon were also militarily allied with the Soviet Union in the Warsaw Pact.

There were three kinds of relationships – besides the 10 full memberships – with the Comecon:
* Yugoslavia was the only country considered to have associate member status. On the basis of the 1964 agreement, Yugoslavia participated in twenty-one of the thirty-two key Comecon institutions as if it were a full member.
* Finland, Iraq, Mexico, and Nicaragua had a cooperant status with Comecon. Because the governments of these countries were not empowered to conclude agreements in the name of private companies, the governments did not take part in Comecon operations. They were represented in Comecon by commissions made up of members of the government and the business community. The commissions were empowered to sign various &quot;framework&quot; agreements with Comecon&#x27;s Joint Commission on Cooperation.
* After 1956, Comecon allowed certain countries with communist or pro-Soviet governments to attend sessions as observers. In November 1986, delegations from Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Laos, and South Yemen attended the 42nd Council Session as observers.

==Exchange==
Working with neither meaningful exchange rates nor a market economy, Comecon countries had to look to world markets as a reference point for prices, but unlike agents acting in a market, prices tended to be stable over a period of years, rather than constantly fluctuating, which assisted central planning. Also, there was a tendency to underprice raw materials relative to the manufactured goods produced in many of the Comecon countries.

International barter helped preserve the Comecon countries&#x27; scarce hard currency reserves. In strict economic terms, barter inevitably harmed countries whose goods would have brought higher prices in the free market or whose imports could have been obtained more cheaply and benefitted those for whom it was the other way around. Still, all of the Comecon countries gained some stability, and the governments gained some legitimacy, and in many ways this stability and protection from the world market was viewed, at least in the early years of Comecon, as an advantage of the system, as was the formation of stronger ties with other socialist countries.

Within Comecon, there were occasional struggles over how this system should work. Early on, Nikolai Voznesensky pushed for a more &quot;law-governed&quot; and technocratic price-based approach. However, with the August 1948 death of Andrei Zhdanov, Voznesensky lost his patron and was soon accused of treason as part of the Leningrad Affair; within two years he was dead in prison. Instead, what won out was a &quot;physical planning&quot; approach that strengthened the role of central governments over technocrats. At the same time, the effort to create a single regime of planning &quot;common economic organization&quot; with the ability to set plans throughout the Comecon region also came to nought. A protocol to create such a system was signed January 18, 1949, but never ratified. While historians are not unanimous on why this was stymied, it clearly threatened the sovereignty not only of the smaller states but even of the Soviet Union itself, since an international body would have had real power; Stalin clearly preferred informal means of intervention in the other Comecon states. This lack of either rationality or international central planning tended to promote autarky in each Comecon country because none fully trusted the others to deliver goods and services.

With few exceptions, foreign trade in the Comecon countries was a state monopoly, and the state agencies and captive trading companies were often corrupt. Even at best, this tended to put several removes between a producer and any foreign customer, limiting the ability to learn to adjust to foreign customers&#x27; needs. Furthermore, there was often strong political pressure to keep the best products for domestic use in each country. From the early 1950s to Comecon&#x27;s demise in the early 1990s, intra-Comecon trade, except for Soviet petroleum, was in steady decline.

===Oil transfers===
Beginning no later than the early 1970s, Soviet petroleum and natural gas were routinely transferred within Comecon at below-market rates. Most Western commentators have viewed this as implicit, politically motivated subsidization of shaky economies to defuse discontent and reward compliance with Soviet wishes. Other commentators say that this may not have been deliberate policy, noting that whenever prices differ from world market prices, there will be winners and losers. They argue that this may have been simply an unforeseen consequence of two factors: the slow adjustment of Comecon prices during a time of rising oil and gas prices, and the fact that mineral resources were abundant in the Comecon sphere, relative to manufactured goods. A possible point of comparison is that there were also winners and losers under EEC agricultural policy in the same period. Russian and Kazakh oil kept the Comecon countries&#x27; oil prices low when the 1973 oil crisis quadrupled Western oil prices.

As one of the Comecon members deemed underdeveloped, Cuba obtained oil in direct exchange for sugar at a rate highly favorable to Cuba. Within the socialist economic paradigm, the subsidies in favor of Cuba and other underdeveloped Comecon members were viewed as rational and fair because they counteracted unequal exchange.

===Ineffective production===
The organization of Comecon was officially focused on common expansion of states, more effective production and building relationships between countries within. And as in every planned economy, operations did not reflect state of market, innovations, availability of items or the specific needs of a country. One example came from former Czechoslovakia. In the 1970s, the Communist party of Czechoslovakia finally realized that there was a need for underground trains. Czechoslovak designers projected a cheap but technologically innovative underground train. The train was a state-of-the-art project, capable of moving underground or on the surface using standard rails, had a high number of passenger seats, and was lightweight. According to the designers, the train was technologically more advanced than the trains used in New York&#x27;s Subway, London&#x27;s Tube or the Paris Metro. However, due to the plan of Comecon, older Soviet trains were used, which guaranteed profit for the Soviet Union and work for workers in Soviet factories. That economical change lead to the cancellation of the R1 trains by A. Honzík. The Comecon plan, though more profitable for the Soviets, if less resourceful for the Czechs and Slovaks, forced the Czechoslovak government to buy trains &quot;Ečs (81–709)&quot; and &quot;81-71&quot;, both of which were designed in early 1950s and were heavy, unreliable and expensive. (Materials available only in Czech Republic and Slovakia, video included)

On the other hand, Czechoslovak trams (Tatra T3) and jet trainers (L-29) were the standard for all Comecon countries, including the USSR, and other countries could develop their own designs but only for their own needs, like Poland (respectively, Konstal trams and TS-11 jets). Poland was a manufacturer of light helicopters for Comecon countries (Mi-2 of the Soviet design). The USSR developed their own model Kamov Ka-26 and Romania produced French helicopters under license for their own market. In a formal or informal way, often the countries were discouraged from developing their own designs that competed with the main Comecon design.

==Structure==

Although not formally part of the organization&#x27;s hierarchy, the Conference of First Secretaries of Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties and of the Heads of Government of the Comecon Member Countries was Comecon&#x27;s most important organ. These party and government leaders gathered for conference meetings regularly to discuss topics of mutual interest. Because of the rank of conference participants, their decisions had considerable influence on the actions taken by Comecon and its organs.

The official hierarchy of Comecon consisted of the Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the executive committee of the council, the Secretariat of the council, four council committees, twenty-four standing commissions, six interstate conferences, two scientific institutes, and several associated organizations.

===The Session===
The Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, officially the highest Comecon organ, examined fundamental problems of economic integration and directed the activities of the Secretariat and other subordinate organizations. Delegations from each Comecon member country attended these meetings. Prime ministers usually headed the delegations, which met during the second quarter of each year in a member country&#x27;s capital (the location of the meeting was determined by a system of rotation based on Cyrillic script). All interested parties had to consider recommendations handed down by the Session. A treaty or other kind of legal agreement implemented adopted recommendations. Comecon itself might adopt decisions only on organizational and procedural matters pertaining to itself and its organs.

Each country appointed one permanent representative to maintain relations between members and Comecon between annual meetings. An extraordinary Session, such as the one in December 1985, might be held with the consent of at least one-third of the members. Such meetings usually took place in Moscow.

===Executive committee===
The highest executive organ in Comecon, the executive committee, was entrusted with elaborating policy recommendations and supervising their implementation between sessions. In addition, it supervised work on plan coordination and scientific-technical cooperation. Composed of one representative from each member country, usually a deputy prime minister, the executive committee met quarterly, usually in Moscow. In 1971 and 1974, the executive committee acquired economic departments that ranked above the standing commissions. These economic departments considerably strengthened the authority and importance of the executive committee.

===Other entities===
There were four council committees: Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning, Council Committee for Scientific and Technical Cooperation, Council Committee for Cooperation in Material and Technical Supply, and Council Committee for Cooperation in Machine Building. Their mission was &quot;to ensure the comprehensive examination and a multilateral settlement of the major problems of cooperation among member countries in the economy, science, and technology.&quot; All committees were headquartered in Moscow and usually met there. These committees advised the standing commissions, the Secretariat, the interstate conferences, and the scientific institutes in their areas of specialization. Their jurisdiction was generally wider than that of the standing commissions because they had the right to make policy recommendations to other Comecon organizations.

The Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning was the most important of the four. It coordinated the national economic plans of Comecon members. As such, it ranked in importance only after the Session and the executive committee. Made up of the chairmen of Comecon members&#x27; national central planning offices, the Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning drew up draft agreements for joint projects, adopted a resolution approving these projects, and recommended approval to the concerned parties. If its decisions were not subject to approval by national governments and parties, this committee would be considered Comecon&#x27;s supranational planning body.

The international Secretariat, Comecon&#x27;s only permanent body, was Comecon&#x27;s primary economic research and administrative organ. The secretary, who has been a Soviet official since Comecon creation, was the official Comecon representative to Comecon member states and to other states and international organizations. Subordinate to the secretary were his deputy and the various departments of the Secretariat, which generally corresponded to the standing commissions. The Secretariat&#x27;s responsibilities included preparation and organization of Comecon sessions and other meetings conducted under the auspices of Comecon; compilation of digests on Comecon activities; conduct of economic and other research for Comecon members; and preparation of recommendations on various issues concerning Comecon operations.

In 1956, eight standing commissions were set up to help Comecon make recommendations pertaining to specific economic sectors. The commissions have been rearranged and renamed a number of times since the establishment of the first eight. In 1986 there were twenty-four standing commissions, each headquartered in the capital of a member country and headed by one of that country&#x27;s leading authorities in the field addressed by the commission. The Secretariat supervised the actual operations of the commissions. The standing commissions had authority only to make recommendations, which had then to be approved by the executive committee, presented to the Session, and ratified by the interested member countries. Commissions usually met twice a year in Moscow.

The six interstate conferences (on water management, internal trade, legal matters, inventions and patents, pricing, and labor affairs) served as forums for discussing shared issues and experiences. They were purely consultative and generally acted in an advisory capacity to the executive committee or its specialized committees.

The scientific institutes on standardization and on economic problems of the world economic system concerned themselves with theoretical problems of international cooperation. Both were headquartered in Moscow and were staffed by experts from various member countries.

===Affiliated agencies===
Several affiliated agencies, having a variety of relationships with Comecon, existed outside the official Comecon hierarchy. They served to develop &quot;direct links between appropriate bodies and organizations of Comecon member countries.&quot;

These affiliated agencies were divided into two categories: intergovernmental economic organizations (which worked on a higher level in the member countries and generally dealt with a wider range of managerial and coordinative activities) and international economic organizations (which worked closer to the operational level of research, production, or trade). A few examples of the former are the International Bank for Economic Cooperation (managed the transferable rouble system), the International Investment Bank (in charge of financing joint projects), and Intermetall (encouraged cooperation in ferrous metallurgy).

International economic organizations generally took the form of either joint enterprises, international economic associations or unions, or international economic partnerships. The latter included Interatominstrument (nuclear machinery producers), Intertekstilmash (textile machinery producers), and Haldex (a Hungarian-Polish joint enterprise for reprocessing coal slag).

==Nature of operation==

Comecon was an interstate organization through which members attempted to coordinate economic activities of mutual interest and to develop multilateral economic, scientific, and technical cooperation:
* The Charter (1959) stated that &quot;the sovereign equality of all members&quot; was fundamental to the organization and procedures of Comecon.
* The Comprehensive Program further emphasized that the processes of integration of members&#x27; economies were &quot;completely voluntary and do not involve the creation of supranational bodies.&quot; Hence under the provisions of the Charter, each country had the right to equal representation and one vote in all organs of Comecon, regardless of the country&#x27;s economic size or the size of its contribution to Comecon&#x27;s budget.
* From 1967, the &quot;interestedness&quot; provisions of the Charter reinforced the principle of &quot;sovereign equality.&quot; Comecon&#x27;s recommendations and decisions could be adopted only upon agreement among the interested members, and each had the right to declare its &quot;interest&quot; in any matter under consideration.
* Furthermore, in the words of the Charter (as revised in 1967), &quot;recommendations and decisions shall not apply to countries that have declared that they have no interest in a particular matter.&quot;
* Although Comecon recognized the principle of unanimity, from 1967 disinterested parties did not have a veto but rather the right to abstain from participation. A declaration of disinterest could not block a project unless the disinterested party&#x27;s participation was vital. Otherwise, the Charter implied that the interested parties could proceed without the abstaining member, affirming that a country that had declared a lack of interest &quot;may subsequently adhere to the recommendations and decisions adopted by the remaining members of the Council.&quot; However, a member country could also declare an &quot;interest&quot; and exercise a veto.

Over the years of its functioning, Comecon acted more as an instrument of mutual economic assistance than a means of economic integration, with multilateralism as an unachievable goal. J.F. Brown, a British historian of Eastern Europe, cited Vladimir Sobell, a Czech-born economist, for the view that Comecon was an &quot;international protection system&quot; rather than an &quot;international trade system&quot;, in contrast with the EEC, which was essentially the latter. Whereas the latter was interested in production efficiency and in allocation via market prices, the former was interested in bilateral aid to fulfill central planning goals. Writing in 1988, Brown stated that many people in both the West and the East had assumed that a trade and efficiency approach was what Comecon was meant to pursue, which might make it an international trade system more like the EEC, and that some economists in Hungary and Poland had advocated such an approach in the 1970s and 1980s, but that &quot;it would need a transformation of every [Eastern Bloc] economy along Hungarian lines [i.e., only partly centrally planned] to enable a market-guided Comecon to work. And any change along those lines has been ideologically unacceptable up to now.&quot;

==Comecon versus the European Economic Community==
Although Comecon was loosely referred to as the &quot;European Economic Community (EEC) of (Central and) Eastern Europe,&quot; important contrasts existed between the two organizations. Both organizations administered economic integration; however, their economic structure, size, balance, and influence differed:

In the 1980s, the EEC incorporated 270 million people in Europe into economic association through intergovernmental agreements aimed at maximizing profits and economic efficiency on a national and international scale. The EEC was a supranational body that could adopt decisions (such as removing tariffs) and enforce them. Activity by members was based on initiative and enterprise from below (on the individual or enterprise level) and was strongly influenced by market forces.

Comecon joined 450 million people in ten countries and on three continents. The level of industrialization from country to country differed greatly: the organization linked two underdeveloped countries – Mongolia, and Vietnam – with some highly industrialized states. Likewise, a large national income difference existed between European and non-European members. The physical size, military power, and political and economic resource base of the Soviet Union made it the dominant member. In trade among Comecon members, the Soviet Union usually provided raw materials, and Central and East European countries provided finished equipment and machinery. The three underdeveloped Comecon members had a special relationship with the other seven. Comecon realized disproportionately more political than economic gains from its heavy contributions to these three countries&#x27; underdeveloped economies. Economic integration or &quot;plan coordination&quot; formed the basis of Comecon&#x27;s activities. In this system, which mirrored the member countries&#x27; planned economies, the decisions handed down from above ignored the influences of market forces or private initiative. Comecon had no supranational authority to make decisions or to implement them. Its recommendations could only be adopted with the full concurrence of interested parties and (from 1967) did not affect those members who declared themselves disinterested parties.

As remarked above, most Comecon foreign trade was a state monopoly, placing several barriers between a producer and a foreign customer. Unlike the EEC, where treaties mostly limited government activity and allowed the market to integrate economies across national lines, Comecon needed to develop agreements that called for positive government action. Furthermore, while private trade slowly limited or erased national rivalries in the EEC, state-to-state trade in Comecon reinforced national rivalries and resentments.

==International relations within the Comecon==

Soviet domination of Comecon was a function of its economic, political, and military power. The Soviet Union possessed 90 percent of Comecon members&#x27; land and energy resources, 70 percent of their population, 65 percent of their national income, and industrial and military capacities second in the world only to those of the United States. The location of many Comecon committee headquarters in Moscow and the large number of Soviet nationals in positions of authority also testified to the power of the Soviet Union within the organization.

Soviet efforts to exercise political power over its Comecon partners, however, were met with determined opposition. The &quot;sovereign equality&quot; of members, as described in the Comecon Charter, assured members that if they did not wish to participate in a Comecon project, they might abstain. Central and East European members frequently invoked this principle in fear that economic interdependence would further reduce political sovereignty. Thus, neither Comecon nor the Soviet Union as a major force within Comecon had supranational authority. Although this fact ensured some degree of freedom from Soviet economic domination of the other members, it also deprived Comecon of necessary power to achieve maximum economic efficiency.

<text>The Place Pigalle is a public square located in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, between the Boulevard de Clichy and the Boulevard de Rochechouart, near the Sacré-Cœur, at the foot of the Montmartre hill.

The square takes its name from the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Pigalle (1714–1785), and it is the best-known square of the &quot;Quartier Pigalle&quot;, the Pigalle district. This site is served by lines 2 and 12 at Pigalle metro station.

==History==
In 1826, Mr. Brack was authorized to form on his land and on land that the city conceded to him by way of exchange, in accordance with the deliberation of the &quot;Conseil municipal&quot; of 1 June 1826, a street 12 meters wide, from the Rue Laval (now the Rue Victor-Massé) to the Porte Montmartre (Montmartre Gate), and a semi-circular square in front of this gate. In 1864, this square, named the &quot;Place de la Barrière-Montmartre&quot;, was renamed the &quot;Place Pigalle&quot;.

On 18 March 1871, General Clément Thomas, having learned that General Claude Lecomte had been seized by the insurgents during the Paris Commune uprising, set out to find him. Dressed in disguise as a civilian, he arrived at around 5 p.m. on the Place Pigalle. When one of the rebels recognized him by his big white beard, he was taken to the Rue des Rosiers and executed.

By 1900 the square and the surrounding streets were a neighbourhood of painters&#x27; studios and literary cafés of which the most renowned was the &quot;Nouvelle Athènes&quot; (New Athens).

==Remarkable buildings and memorable places==
* No 1: former location of the Café L&#x27;Abbaye de Thélème, which exhibited painters.
* No 3, at the corner with the Avenue Frochot: former location of the Café du Rat Mort, which was open at the end of the 19th century all night.
* No 5: location of the workshop of Gabriel Dauchot (1927–2005), painter from the School of Paris.
* No 9: former location of the Café de la Nouvelle Athènes. Photographer Paul Sescau (1858–1926) opened his second studio above in 1896 to be as close as possible to his artistic clientele. The Café de la Nouvelle Athènes became Le Sphynx in the 1920s and 1940s, a strip tease place, then the New Moon, which was a lesbian cabaret in the 1960s and 1970s, then in the 1980s and 1990s welcomed rock groups. The entire original building burnt down in 2004 and was demolished. This place was the property for over thirty years of the Polish-born French striptease artist Hélène Martini.
* No 11: the Folies Pigalle, a former Italian theater, then cabaret and finally cinema hall, which became a nightclub from 1991.

==In popular culture==
* The Place Pigalle inspired a celebrated song by Georges Ulmer: &quot;&quot;Un p&#x27;tit jet d&#x27;eau, une station de métro, entourée de bistrots, Pigalle ... .&quot; &quot; (&quot;A little spritz of water, a subway station, surrounded by bistros, Pigalle ... .&quot;)
* &quot;Place Pigalle&quot; is also the title of a song written by Alex Alstone and Maurice Chevalier. It was recorded by Chevalier with orchestra (Jacques Hélian, conductor) in Paris on 9 April 1946.
* &quot;Figure 8&quot;—Elliott Smith&#x27;s fifth album and the last he released in his lifetime—was initially titled &quot;Place Pigalle&quot;. It is also the name of one of his unreleased songs, and he had &quot;two or three more songs&quot; about it.
* Hungarian pop star Eva Csepregi, of Neoton Familia, mentions the square and its notoriety as a red-light district in her 1987 solo single &quot;Párizsi Lány&quot; (&quot;Paris Girl&quot;).

<doc id="384327" wikidata="Q638846" url="?curid=384327" title="Intersection number">
<text>In mathematics, and especially in algebraic geometry, the intersection number generalizes the intuitive notion of counting the number of times two curves intersect to higher dimensions, multiple (more than 2) curves, and accounting properly for tangency. One needs a definition of intersection number in order to state results like Bézout&#x27;s theorem.

The intersection number is obvious in certain cases, such as the intersection of the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-axes in a plane, which should be one. The complexity enters when calculating intersections at points of tangency, and intersections which are not just points, but have higher dimension. For example, if a plane is tangent to a surface along a line, the intersection number along the line should be at least two. These questions are discussed systematically in intersection theory.

== Definition for Riemann surfaces ==

Let &quot;X&quot; be a Riemann surface. Then the intersection number of two closed curves on &quot;X&quot; has a simple definition in terms of an integral. For every closed curve &quot;c&quot; on &quot;X&quot; (i.e., smooth function formula_1), we can associate a differential form formula_2 of compact support, the Poincaré dual of &quot;c&quot;, with the property that integrals along &quot;c&quot; can be calculated by integrals over &quot;X&quot;:

:formula_3, for every closed (1-)differential formula_4 on &quot;X&quot;,

where formula_5 is the wedge product of differentials, and formula_6 is the Hodge star. Then the intersection number of two closed curves, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, on &quot;X&quot; is defined as

:formula_7.

The formula_2 have an intuitive definition as follows. They are a sort of dirac delta along the curve &quot;c&quot;, accomplished by taking the differential of a unit step function that drops from 1 to 0 across &quot;c&quot;. More formally, we begin by defining for a simple closed curve &quot;c&quot; on &quot;X&quot;, a function &quot;fc&quot; by letting formula_9 be a small strip around &quot;c&quot; in the shape of an annulus. Name the left and right parts of formula_10 as formula_11 and formula_12. Then take a smaller sub-strip around &quot;c&quot;, formula_13, with left and right parts formula_14 and formula_15. Then define &quot;fc&quot; by

:formula_16.

The definition is then expanded to arbitrary closed curves. Every closed curve &quot;c&quot; on &quot;X&quot; is homologous to formula_17 for some simple closed curves &quot;ci&quot;, that is,

:formula_18, for every differential formula_19.

Define the formula_2 by

:formula_21.

== Definition for algebraic varieties ==

The usual constructive definition in the case of algebraic varieties proceeds in steps. The definition given below is for the intersection number of divisors on a nonsingular variety &quot;X&quot;.

1. The only intersection number that can be calculated directly from the definition is the intersection of hypersurfaces (subvarieties of &quot;X&quot; of codimension one) that are in general position at &quot;x&quot;. Specifically, assume we have a nonsingular variety &quot;X&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; hypersurfaces &quot;Z&quot;&quot;1&quot;, ..., &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot; which have local equations &quot;f&quot;&quot;1&quot;, ..., &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot; near &quot;x&quot; for polynomials &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;t&quot;&quot;1&quot;, ..., &quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot;), such that the following hold:

* formula_22.
* formula_23 for all &quot;i&quot;. (i.e., &quot;x&quot; is in the intersection of the hypersurfaces.)
* formula_24 (i.e., the divisors are in general position.)
* The formula_25 are nonsingular at &quot;x&quot;.

Then the intersection number at the point &quot;x&quot; (called the intersection multiplicity at &quot;x&quot;) is

:formula_26,

where formula_27 is the local ring of &quot;X&quot; at &quot;x&quot;, and the dimension is dimension as a &quot;k&quot;-vector space. It can be calculated as the localization formula_28, where formula_29 is the maximal ideal of polynomials vanishing at &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;U&quot; is an open affine set containing &quot;x&quot; and containing none of the singularities of the &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;.

2. The intersection number of hypersurfaces in general position is then defined as the sum of the intersection numbers at each point of intersection.

:formula_30

3. Extend the definition to &quot;effective&quot; divisors by linearity, i.e.,

:formula_31 and formula_32.

4. Extend the definition to arbitrary divisors in general position by noticing every divisor has a unique expression as &quot;D&quot; = &quot;P&quot; – &quot;N&quot; for some effective divisors &quot;P&quot; and &quot;N&quot;. So let &quot;D&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;P&quot;&quot;i&quot; – &quot;N&quot;i, and use rules of the form

:formula_33

to transform the intersection.

5. The intersection number of arbitrary divisors is then defined using a &quot;Chow&#x27;s moving lemma&quot; that guarantees we can find linearly equivalent divisors that are in general position, which we can then intersect.

Note that the definition of the intersection number does not depend on the order in which the divisors appear in the computation of this number.

== Serre&#x27;s Tor formula ==
Let &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; be two subvarieties of a nonsingular projective variety &quot;X&quot; such that dim(&quot;V&quot;) + dim(&quot;W&quot;) = dim(&quot;X&quot;). Then we expect the intersection &quot;V&quot; ∩ &quot;W&quot; to be a finite set of points. If we try to count them, two kinds of problems may arise. First, even if the expected dimension of &quot;V&quot; ∩ &quot;W&quot; is zero, the actual intersection may be of a large dimension: for example the self-intersection number of a projective line in a projective plane. The second potential problem is that even if the intersection is zero-dimensional, it may be non-transverse, for example, if &quot;V&quot; is a plane curve and &quot;W&quot; is one of its tangent lines.

The first problem requires the machinery of intersection theory, discussed above in detail, which replaces &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; by more convenient subvarieties using the moving lemma. On the other hand, the second problem can be solved directly, without moving &quot;V&quot; or &quot;W&quot;. In 1965 Jean-Pierre Serre described how to find the multiplicity of each intersection point by methods of commutative algebra and homological algebra. This connection between a geometric notion of intersection and a homological notion of a derived tensor product has been influential and led in particular to several homological conjectures in commutative algebra.

Serre&#x27;s Tor formula states: let &quot;X&quot; be a regular variety, &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; two subvarieties of complementary dimension such that &quot;V&quot; ∩ &quot;W&quot; is zero-dimensional. For any point &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;V&quot; ∩ &quot;W&quot;, let &quot;A&quot; be the local ring formula_27 of &quot;x&quot;. The structure sheaves of &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; at &quot;x&quot; correspond to ideals &quot;I&quot;, &quot;J&quot; ⊆ &quot;A&quot;. Then the multiplicity of &quot;V&quot; ∩ &quot;W&quot; at the point &quot;x&quot; is
:formula_35
where length is the length of a module over a local ring, and Tor is the Tor functor. When &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; can be moved into a transverse position, this homological formula produces the expected answer. So, for instance, if &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; meet transversely at &quot;x&quot;, the multiplicity is 1. If &quot;V&quot; is a tangent line at a point &quot;x&quot; to a parabola &quot;W&quot; in a plane at a point &quot;x&quot;, then the multiplicity at &quot;x&quot; is 2.

If both &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; are locally cut out by regular sequences, for example if they are nonsingular, then in the formula above all higher Tor&#x27;s vanish, hence the multiplicity is positive. The positivity in the arbitrary case is one of Serre&#x27;s multiplicity conjectures.

== Further definitions ==

The definition can be vastly generalized, for example to intersections along subvarieties instead of just at points, or to arbitrary complete varieties.

In algebraic topology, the intersection number appears as the Poincaré dual of the cup product. Specifically, if two manifolds, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, intersect transversely in a manifold &quot;M&quot;, the homology class of the intersection is the Poincaré dual of the cup product formula_36 of the Poincaré duals of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.

== Snapper–Kleiman definition of intersection number ==
There is an approach to intersection number, introduced by Snapper in 1959-60 and developed later by Cartier and Kleiman, that defines an intersection number as an Euler characteristic.

Let &quot;X&quot; be a scheme over a scheme &quot;S&quot;, Pic(&quot;X&quot;) the Picard group of &quot;X&quot; and G the Grothendieck group of the category of coherent sheaves on &quot;X&quot; whose support is proper over an Artinian subscheme of &quot;S&quot;.

For each &quot;L&quot; in Pic(&quot;X&quot;), define the endomorphism &quot;c&quot;1(&quot;L&quot;) of G (called the first Chern class of &quot;L&quot;) by
:formula_37
It is additive on G since tensoring with a line bundle is exact. One also has:
*formula_38; in particular, formula_39 and formula_40 commute.
*formula_41
*formula_42 (this is nontrivial and follows from a dévissage argument.)
The intersection number
:formula_43
of line bundles &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s is then defined by:
:formula_44
where χ denotes the Euler characteristic. Alternatively, one has by induction:
:formula_45
Each time &quot;F&quot; is fixed, formula_46 is a symmetric functional in &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s.

If &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot;(&quot;D&quot;&quot;i&quot;) for some Cartier divisors &quot;D&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s, then we will write formula_47 for the intersection number.

Let formula_48 be a morphism of &quot;S&quot;-schemes, formula_49 line bundles on &quot;X&quot; and &quot;F&quot; in G with formula_50. Then
:formula_51.

== Intersection multiplicities for plane curves ==

There is a unique function assigning to each triplet formula_52 consisting of a pair of projective curves, formula_53 and formula_54, in formula_55 and a point formula_56, a number formula_57 called the &quot;intersection multiplicity&quot; of formula_53 and formula_54 at formula_60 that satisfies the following properties:

# formula_61
# formula_62 if and only if formula_53 and formula_54 have a common factor that is zero at formula_60
# formula_66 if and only if one of formula_67 or formula_68 is non-zero (i.e. the point formula_60 is not in the intersection of the two curves)
# formula_70 where formula_71
# formula_72
# formula_73 for any formula_74

Although these properties completely characterize intersection multiplicity, in practice it is realised in several different ways.

One realization of intersection multiplicity is through the dimension of a certain quotient space of the power series ring formula_75. By making a change of variables if necessary, we may assume that formula_71. Let formula_77 and formula_78 be the polynomials defining the algebraic curves we are interested in. If the original equations are given in homogeneous form, these can be obtained by setting formula_79. Let formula_80 denote the ideal of formula_75 generated by formula_53 and formula_54. The intersection multiplicity is the dimension of formula_84 as a vector space over formula_85.

Another realization of intersection multiplicity comes from the resultant of the two polynomials formula_53 and formula_54. In coordinates where formula_71, the curves have no other intersections with formula_89, and the degree of formula_53 with respect to formula_91 is equal to the total degree of formula_53, formula_57 can be defined as the highest power of formula_94 that divides the resultant of formula_53 and formula_54 (with formula_53 and formula_54 seen as polynomials over formula_99).

Intersection multiplicity can also be realised as the number of distinct intersections that exist if the curves are perturbed slightly. More specifically, if formula_53 and formula_54 define curves which intersect only once in the closure of an open set formula_102, then for a dense set of formula_103, formula_104 and formula_105 are smooth and intersect transversally (i.e. have different tangent lines) at exactly some number formula_106 points in formula_102. We say then that formula_108.

=== Example ===
Consider the intersection of the &quot;x&quot;-axis with the parabola formula_109 at the origin.

Writing formula_110 formula_111and formula_71 we get

: formula_113

Thus, the intersection multiplicity is two; it is an ordinary tangency. Similarly one can compute that the curves formula_114 and formula_115 with integers formula_116 intersect at the origin with multiplicity &quot;formula_117&quot;

== Self-intersections ==

Some of the most interesting intersection numbers to compute are &quot;self-intersection numbers&quot;. This means that a divisor is moved to another equivalent divisor in general position with respect to the first, and the two are intersected. In this way, self-intersection numbers can become well-defined, and even negative.

== Applications ==

The intersection number is partly motivated by the desire to define intersection to satisfy Bézout&#x27;s theorem.

The intersection number arises in the study of fixed points, which can be cleverly defined as intersections of function graphs with a diagonals. Calculating the intersection numbers at the fixed points counts the fixed points &quot;with multiplicity&quot;, and leads to the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem in quantitative form.

<doc id="384339" wikidata="Q7917123" url="?curid=384339" title="Mammalian embryogenesis">
<text>Mammalian embryogenesis is the process of cell division and cellular differentiation during early prenatal development which leads to the development of a mammalian embryo.

== Difference from embryogenesis of lower chordates ==

Due to the fact that placental mammals and marsupials nourish their developing embryos via the placenta, the ovum in these species does not contain significant amounts of yolk, and the yolk sac in the embryo is relatively small in size, in comparison with both the size of the embryo itself and the size of yolk sac in embryos of comparable developmental age from lower chordates. The fact that an embryo in both placental mammals and marsupials undergoes the process of implantation, and forms the chorion with its chorionic villi, and later the placenta and umbilical cord, is also a difference from lower chordates.

The difference between a mammalian embryo and an embryo of a lower chordate animal is evident starting from blastula stage. Due to that fact, the developing mammalian embryo at this stage is called a blastocyst, not a blastula, which is more generic term.

There are also several other differences from embryogenesis in lower chordates. One such difference is that in mammalian embryos development of the central nervous system and especially the brain tends to begin at earlier stages of embryonic development and to yield more structurally advanced brain at each stage, in comparison with lower chordates. The evolutionary reason for such a change likely was that the advanced and structurally complex brain, characteristic of mammals, requires more time to develop, but the maximum time spent in utero is limited by other factors, such as relative size of the final fetus to the mother (ability of the fetus to pass mother&#x27;s genital tract to be born), limited resources for the mother to nourish herself and her fetus, etc. Thus, to develop such a complex and advanced brain in the end, the mammalian embryo needed to start this process earlier and to perform it faster.

Another difference is that during the development of embryonic genitourinary tract, in case of female embryo of placental and marsupial mammals, the uterus is formed, a structure that neither monotremata nor lower chordates have. In every case, including monotremata embryos, the milk glands also develop.

== Difference from human embryogenesis ==
Most mammals develop similarly to humans; during the earliest stages of development, the embryo is largely indistinguishable from another mammal. However, there are phenomena found in human beings not found in all other mammals, as well as phenomena occurring in other mammals, but not in humans.

===Humans===
Mammals do not have the same human chorionic gonadotropin released from their embryo.

===Non-human mammals===
The anatomy of the area surrounding an embryo or fetus is different in litter-bearing animals compared to humans: each unborn animal is surrounded by placental tissue and is lodged along one of two long uterine horns rather than in the center of the pear-shaped uterus found in a human female.

<doc id="384358" wikidata="Q2337259" url="?curid=384358" title="Brylcreem">
<text>Brylcreem () is a British brand of hair styling products for men. The first Brylcreem product was a hair cream created in 1928 by County Chemicals at the Chemico Works in Bradford Street, Birmingham, England, and is the flagship product of the brand. The cream is an emulsion of water and mineral oil stabilised with beeswax. It is notable for the high shine it provides, which spawned the name of the product, stemming from &quot;brilliantine&quot; and &quot;cream&quot;.

==Ownership ==
The British pharmaceutical firm Beecham was the longtime owner of Brylcreem. Sara Lee acquired the personal care unit of SmithKline Beecham in June 1993. In January 2012, the global rights to the Brylcreem brand were sold by Sara Lee Corporation to Unilever.

Brylcreem is marketed in the United States by Combe Incorporated, in Europe by Unilever and in India by Hindustan Unilever Limited. Before Godrej acquired a 51% stake of Sara Lee, in their joint venture &quot;Godrej Sara Lee&quot; in May 2010, the brand was distributed by Godrej in India.

==Jingle==

It was first advertised on television with the jingle &quot;Brylcreem — A Little Dab&#x27;ll Do Ya! Brylcreem — You&#x27;ll look so debonair. Brylcreem — The gals&#x27;ll all pursue ya; they&#x27;ll love to run their fingers through your hair!&quot;. Another version was &quot;Brylcreem—a little dab will do ya! Use more only if you dare; but watch out! The gals will all pursue ya! They&#x27;ll love to run their fingers through your hair!&quot;

The jingle was created by Hanley M. Norins of the Young &amp; Rubicam advertising agency. The television advertisement for Brylcreem included a cartoon animation of a man with (initially) shaggy hair, who happily has a little dab applied, and, miraculously, the hair combs and smooths itself.

When the dry look became popular, partly inspired by the unoiled moptops of the Beatles, the last line was changed from &quot;They&#x27;ll love to run their fingers through your hair&quot;, to &quot;They&#x27;ll love the natural look it gives your hair&quot;. Subsequent television advertisements used the mottoes &quot;Grooms without gumming&quot; and later, in the 1970s, in the United Kingdom and Canada, &quot;A little dab of Brylcreem on your hair gives you the Brylcreem bounce&quot;.

==Notable users and popular culture==

* &quot;The Brylcreem Boys&quot; is a film from 1998, directed and co-written by Terence Ryan, about the internment of Axis and Allied combatants during World War II.
* Denis Compton, the Middlesex and England batsman and Arsenal footballer, was one of the earliest British sportsmen to make serious money from product endorsement when he advertised Brylcreem in the 1940s and 1950s.
* Waylon Jennings during his years in the Nashville sound era of his career always sported Brylcreem over the much more popular Royal Crown brand of pomade sported by friends and other stars of the scene like Johnny Cash. Waylon later ditched the style in 1972, when he began growing out his hair, which would eventually become a part of his signature style. 
* In 1955 Fazal Mahmood was the first Pakistani cricketer to model for Brylcreem. It was the first time a commercial brand had hired a Pakistani cricketer as a model.
* During the Second World War, members of the RAF became known as &quot;Brylcreem boys&quot;. While there is a popular belief that it was intended as an insult by other branches of the forces due to the RAF&#x27;s perceived safe and comfortable job back in Britain, in fact the truth is more prosaic: Brylcreem used an image of an RAF airman in their print ads from 1939.
* Jimmy Buffett sang the Brylcreem jingle at the end of Pencil Thin Mustache.
*In the Seinfeld episode &quot;The Conversion&quot;, the balding character George Costanza mentions having Brylcreem in his medicine cabinet when discussing how people tend to hold on to older items that they may no longer need.

<doc id="384366" wikidata="Q9298868" url="?curid=384366" title="Ladybird, Ladybird">
<text>&quot;Ladybird, Ladybird&quot; is the first line of an English-language nursery rhyme that also has German analogues. It is included in the Roud Folk Song Index as number of 16215.

== The rhyme==
This traditional verse relates to ladybirds, brightly coloured insects commonly viewed as lucky. The English version has been dated to at least 1744, when it appeared in &quot;Tommy Thumb&#x27;s Pretty Songbook&quot; Vol. 2. The verse has several popular forms, including:

:Ladybird, ladybird fly away home,
:Your house is on fire and your children are gone,
:All except one, and her name is Ann,
:And she hid under the baking pan.

A shorter, grimmer version concludes:
:Your house is on fire,
:Your children shall burn!

The child who hides may also be named &quot;Nan&quot;, &quot;Anne&quot; and &quot;Little Anne&quot; and she has hidden under a &quot;warming pan&quot;, &quot;porridge pan&quot;, &quot;frying pan&quot; or even a &quot;pudding pan&quot;. Alternatively, her name may be &quot;Aileen&quot; and her hiding place a &quot;soup tureen&quot;. A widely varying Peterborough version makes the remaining child a boy: 
:Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home, / Your horse is on foot, your children are gone;
:All but one, and that&#x27;s little John, / And he lies under the grindle stone.

==Insect names==
The insect goes by a variety of other names in British dialect rhymes. One Yorkshire version recorded in 1842 begins “Ladycow, Ladycow, ply thy way home”, while Charlotte Brontë calls it a “lady-clock”. In Scotland a rhyme from the same period is recorded as 
::Dowdy-cow, dowdy-cow, ride away heame,
::Thy house is burnt, and thy bairns are tean. 
American names include “ladybug”, first recorded in 1699, although the equivalent rhyme is not mentioned until the 19th century, as in &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (1876). Also in the US, doodlebugs are substituted for ladybugs and are exhorted to “Come out of your hole”.

The name ladybird contains a reference to Mary, mother of Jesus, often referred to as Our Lady, a convention that occurs in other European cultures where the insect is similarly addressed. In Germany it is the Marienkäfer, where a nursery rhyme runs “Marybug, fly away, your house is on fire, your wee mother weeps” (&quot;Marienkäferchen, fliege weg! Dein Haüschen brennt, Dein Mutterchen flennt&quot;). In a similar rhyme it is addressed as Himmelsküchlichen: “Sky-winger, fly away, your house is in flames, your children together in tears” (&quot;Deiner Kinder weinen alle miteinander&quot;). In Sweden the religious connection was maintained by calling the insect Jungfru Marias Nyckelpiga (Virgin Mary&#x27;s keyholder), but with a slightly different rhyme.

==Adult&#x27;s and children&#x27;s lore==
Because of the religious connotation of such names, one speculation would date the rhyme back to the 16th century and have it sung as a warning at a time when there was legislation against Catholics. Another connects it with a story that after prayers for help Our Lady brought the insect to destroy a plague of plant-destroying pests. According to other lore, farmers recite the rhyme to save the insects who do them this service before setting fire to stubble fields. Among children, it is common to place the ladybird on their hand or blow it from their clothing and make a wish while reciting the rhyme.

A literary variation on the rhyme was written by Caroline Anne Southey, published under the pseudonym &quot;C.&quot; early in the 19th century. The nine-stanza poem appeared in an 1827 issue of Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine. Titled &quot;To The Lady Bird&quot;, the first stanza reads
::Lady-bird, Lady-bird, fly away home,
::The field mouse is gone to her nest,
::The daisies have shut up their sleepy red eyes
::And the birds and the bees are at rest
and continues with much the same formula and similar natural details for a further eight stanzas, at one point referencing the fairy myths of Oberon. &quot;To The Lady Bird&quot;, or excerpted stanzas from it, went on to appear in various publications through the next century and beyond. One stanza was also included at the head of an unpublished poem by Emily Brontë on a completely different subject.

<text>The Baltimore oriole (Icterus galbula) is a small icterid blackbird common in eastern North America as a migratory breeding bird. It received its name from the resemblance of the male&#x27;s colors to those on the coat-of-arms of 17th-century Lord Baltimore. Observations of interbreeding between the Baltimore oriole and the western Bullock&#x27;s oriole &quot;Icterus bullockii&quot;, led to both being classified as a single species, called the northern oriole, from 1973 to 1995. Research by James Rising, a professor of zoology at the University of Toronto, and others showed that the two birds actually did not interbreed significantly.

The Baltimore oriole is the state bird of Maryland, and the namesake and mascot for the Baltimore Orioles baseball team.

==Taxonomy==
The Baltimore oriole was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Coracias galbula&quot;. He specified the type locality as America, but this was restricted to Virginia in 1931. Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;Baltimore-Bird&quot; that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; that was published between 1729 and 1732. The Baltimore oriole is now one of 32 New World orioles placed in the genus &quot;Icterus&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French ornithologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

Like all New World orioles, this species is named after an unrelated, physically similar family found in the Old World: the Oriolidae. The word &quot;Oriole&quot; ultimately derives from the Latin &quot;aureolus&quot;, &quot;golden&quot;. The genus name &quot;Icterus&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;ikteros&quot;, a yellow bird, usually taken to be the Eurasian golden oriole, the sight of which was thought to cure jaundice. The specific &quot;galbula&quot; is the Latin name for a yellow bird, again usually assumed to be the golden oriole.

==Description==

This medium-sized passerine measures in length and spans across the wings. Their build is typical of icterids, as they have a sturdy body, a longish tail, fairly long legs and a thick, pointed bill. The body weight averages , with a range of weights from . The male oriole is slightly larger than the female, although the size dimorphism is minimal by icterid standards. Adults always have white bars on the wings.

The adult male is orange on the underparts, shoulder patch, and rump, with some birds appearing a very deep flaming orange and others appearing yellowish orange. All of the rest of the male&#x27;s plumage is black. The adult female is yellow brown on the upper parts with darker wings, and dull orange yellow on the breast and belly. The juvenile oriole is similar looking to the female, with males taking until the fall of their second year to reach adult plumage.


==Distribution and habitat==

Baltimore orioles live in the Nearctic in summer, including the Canadian Prairies and eastern Montana in the northwest eastward through southern Ontario, southern Quebec and New Brunswick and south through the eastern United States to central Mississippi and Alabama and northern Georgia. They migrate to winter in the Neotropics as far north as Mexico and sometimes the southern coast of the United States, but predominantly in Central America and northern South America. Some areas of the southern United States may retain orioles all winter if they have feeders that appeal to them. The range of this bird overlaps with that of the similar Bullock&#x27;s oriole in the Midwest, and the two species were once considered to be conspecific under the name northern oriole because they form fertile hybrids. The Baltimore oriole is a rare vagrant to Western Europe.

Baltimore orioles are often found high up in large, leafy deciduous trees, but do not generally reside in deep forests. The species has been found in summer and migration in open woodland, forest edge, and partially wooded wetlands or stands of trees along rivers. They are very adaptable and can breed in a variety of secondary habitats. In recent times, they are often found in orchards, farmland, urban parks and suburban landscapes as long as they retain woodlots. In Mexico, they winter in flowering canopy trees, often over shade coffee plantations.

From 1966 to 2015, the Baltimore oriole experienced a greater than 1.5% annual population decrease throughout the northern and eastern parts of its breeding range. Among other causes Dutch elm disease destroyed a meaningful amount of their favorite nesting locations: elm trees.

==Behavior==
===Song and calls===
The Baltimore orioles&#x27; song is a short set of recognizable, sweet whistles that sound like &quot;&quot;tyew, pyeer, peededoo, and &quot;teer.&quot; Calls include &quot;veeer,&quot; which is an unusual nasal sound, a low chatter call, and two high calls which sound like &quot;tyew-li&quot; and &quot;kleek.&quot;

The male Baltimore oriole song is a clear whistle with a vibrant tone that flows and includes a brief sequence of notes that are paired and repeated 2-7 times, lasting 1-2 seconds. Sometimes during breeding season mature male orioles will make a &quot;flutter-drum sound&quot;&quot; to each other while in flight by making noise as they move their wings. Male orioles sing to proclaim and protect territory. The female Baltimore oriole also sings to communicate and while protecting her nest she gives a distinctive call which sounds like a fierce screech. Both male and female orioles make specific warning calls that sound like inharmonious chatter during combative confrontations. If there are other species of orioles in the area that hear the chatter, they will respond to alert calls and try to help defend the territory.

===Breeding===
Baltimore orioles are basically solitary outside their mating season. The species is generally considered monogamous, although evidence suggests that extra-pair copulation is relatively common. In the spring, males establish a territory and then display to females by singing and chattering while hopping from perch to perch in front of them. Males also give a bow display, bowing with wings lowered and tail fanned. Depending on their receptiveness, the females may ignore these displays or sing and give calls or a wing-quiver display in response. The wing-quiver display involves leaning forward, often with the tail partly fanned, and fluttering or quivering slightly lowered wings.

The Baltimore oriole&#x27;s nest is built by the female. It is a tightly woven, bundle-like pouch located on the end of a branch, consisting of any fine plant or animal materials available, hanging down on the underside. Trees such as elm, cottonwood, maple, willow, or apple are regularly selected, with the nest usually located around above the ground. The female lays three to seven eggs, with the norm being around four. The eggs are pale gray to bluish-white, measuring on average. The incubation period is 12 to 14 days. Once the nestlings hatch, they are fed by regurgitation by both parents and brooded by the female for two weeks. After this, the young start to fledge, becoming largely independent shortly thereafter. If the eggs, young, or nest are destroyed, the oriole is unable to lay a replacement clutch.

===Mortality===
Predation of adults is a common source of mortality, typically also occurring with eggs, nestlings, and fledglings. Common predators at Baltimore oriole nests can include common grackles, American crows, blue jays, black-billed magpies, tree squirrels, and domestic cats, which most commonly capture newly fledged orioles or adults engaged in brooding behavior. Rapacious birds commonly prey on both young and fully-grown orioles, the most prolific being the eastern screech owl and Cooper&#x27;s and sharp-shinned hawks. Somewhat larger rapacious birds also sometimes opportunistically prey on the oriole, including peregrine falcons, great horned owls, and barn owls, while merlins may do so while orioles are migrating.

The oldest recorded Baltimore oriole lived to 11 years and 7 months in the wild. They have been recorded living up to 14 years in captivity.

===Feeding===

Baltimore orioles forage in trees and shrubs, also making short flights to catch insects. They acrobatically clamber, hover, and hang among foliage as they comb high branches. They mainly eat insects, berries, and nectar, and are often seen sipping at hummingbird feeders. Their favored prey is perhaps the forest tent caterpillar moth, which they typically eat in their larval stage, and can be a nuisance species if not naturally regulated by predation. The larvae caterpillar is beaten against a branch until their protective hairs are skinned off before being eaten. They will also consume beetles, grasshoppers, wasps, bugs, and spiders. Baltimore orioles&#x27; consumption of forest tent caterpillars at the stage of development when they do the most damage to forest trees and plants, plays an important role in the ecosystem.

Unlike American robins and many other fruit-eating birds, Baltimore orioles seem to prefer only ripe, dark-colored fruit. Orioles seek out the darkest mulberries, the reddest cherries, and the deepest-purple grapes, and will ignore green grapes and yellow cherries even if they are ripe. Baltimore orioles sometimes use their bills to &quot;gape&quot;, stabbing their closed bill into soft fruits, then opening them to lap the juice with their tongues. During spring and fall, nectar, fruit, and other sugary foods are readily converted into fat, which supplies energy for migration. Many people now attract Baltimore orioles to their backyards with oriole feeders. Many contain essentially the same food as hummingbird feeders, but are designed for orioles, are orange instead of red, and have larger perches. Baltimore orioles are also fond of halved oranges, grape jelly, and in their winter quarters, the red arils of gumbo-limbo (&quot;Bursera simaruba&quot;). If they discover a well-kept feeder, orioles lead their young there.
