==History==

The governmental railway from reached Kyoto on 5 September 1876, but the station was under construction and a temporary facility called Ōmiya-dōri (Ōmiya Street) Temporary Station was used until the opening of the main station. The first Kyoto Station opened for service by decree of Emperor Meiji on 5 February 1877.

In 1889, the railway became a part of the trunk line to Tokyo (Tokaido Main Line). Subsequently, the station became the terminal of two private railways, Nara Railway (1895, present-day Nara Line) and Kyoto Railway (1897, present-day Sagano Line), that connected the station with southern and northern regions of Kyoto Prefecture, respectively.

The station was replaced by a newer, Renaissance-inspired facility in 1914, which featured a broad square (the site of demolished first station) leading from the station to Shichijō Avenue. Before and during World War II, the square was often used by imperial motorcades when Emperor Showa traveled between Kyoto and Tokyo. The station was spacious and designed to handle a large number of people, but when a few thousand people gathered to bid farewell to naval recruits on 8 January 1934, 77 people were crushed to death. This station burned to the ground in 1950, and was replaced by a more utilitarian concrete facility in 1952.

Aside from the main building on the north side of the station, the Hachijō-guchi building on the south side was built to house Tokaido Shinkansen which started operation in 1964. The underground facilities of the station, including the shopping mall &quot;Porta&quot; beneath the station square, were constructed when the subway opened in 1981.

The current Kyoto Station was designed by architect Hiroshi Hara, and it opened in 1997 which commemorated Kyoto&#x27;s 1,200th anniversary. It is 70 meters high and 470 meters from east to west, with a total floor area of 238,000 square meters. Architecturally, it exhibits many characteristics of futurism, with a slightly irregular cubic façade of plate glass over a steel frame. During the mid-1990s, Kyoto was one of the least modern cities in Japan by virtue of its many cultural heritage sites, so locals were largely reluctant to accept such an ambitious structure. However, the station&#x27;s completion began a wave of new high-rise developments in Kyoto that culminated in the 20-story Kyocera Building.

Station numbers were introduced to the JR Lines in March 2018. Kyoto Station was assigned:

* JR-A31 for the Tokaido Main Line
* JR-B31 for the Kosei Line
* JR-E01 for the San&#x27;in Main Line
* JR-D01 for the Nara Line

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2016, the JR West part of the station was used by an average of 200,426 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the second busiest JR West station after . The Kyoto City Subway station was used by an average of 123,360 passengers daily (in fiscal 2016).

<doc id="376384" wikidata="Q704982" url="?curid=376384" title="Yellow-legged gull">
<text>The yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) is a large gull found in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, which has only recently achieved wide recognition as a distinct species. It was formerly treated as a subspecies of either the Caspian gull &quot;L. cachinnans&quot;, or more broadly as a subspecies of the herring gull &quot;L. argentatus&quot;.
The genus name is from Latin &quot;Larus&quot; which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird, and the species name honours the German zoologist Karl Michahelles.

It is now generally accepted that the yellow-legged gull is a full species, but until recently there was much disagreement. For example, &quot;British Birds&quot; magazine split the yellow-legged gull from the herring gull in 1993 but included the Caspian gull in the former, but the BOU in Great Britain retained the yellow-legged gull as a subspecies of the herring gull until 2007. DNA research, however, suggests that the yellow-legged gull is actually closest to the great black-backed gull &quot;L. marinus&quot; and the Armenian gull &quot;L. armenicus&quot;, while the Caspian gull is closer to the herring gull and the lesser black-backed gull &quot;L. fuscus&quot;, rather than being each other&#x27;s closest relatives.

There are two subspecies of the yellow-legged gull:
There is also the subspecies &quot;L. m. omissus&quot;, first described in 1928 by the Russian ornithologist Theodor Pleske.
==Distribution==
The breeding range is centred on the Mediterranean Sea. In North Africa, it is common in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia and increasing in places. Recent breeding has occurred in Libya and Egypt. In the Middle East, a few breed in Israel, Palestine and Syria with larger numbers in Cyprus and Turkey. In Europe, there are colonies all along the Mediterranean coast, and also on the Atlantic islands and coasts north to Brittany and west to the Azores. It also breeds on the western side of the Black Sea; here it overlaps with the Caspian gull but there is a difference in habitat, with the yellow-legged gull preferring sea cliffs and the Caspian gull flatter shores. In recent decades birds have spread north into central and western Europe. One to four pairs have attempted to breed in southern England since 1995 (sometimes hybrid pairs with lesser black-backed gulls), though colonisation has been very slow.

Many birds remain in the same area all year round, but others migrate to spend the winter in mild areas of western Europe or head south as far as Senegal, Gambia and the Red Sea. There is also extensive northward post-breeding dispersal in the late summer, with numbers in southern England high from July to October. It is reported as a vagrant to northeastern North America and Nigeria.

==Description==


The yellow-legged gull is a large gull, though the size does vary, with the smallest females being scarcely larger than a common gull and the largest males being roughly the size of a great black-backed gull. They range in length from in total length, from in wingspan and from in weight. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . Adults are externally similar to herring gulls but have yellow legs. They have a grey back, slightly darker than herring gulls but lighter than lesser black-backed gulls. They are much whiter-headed in autumn, and have more extensively black wing tips with few white spots, just as lesser black-backed. They have a red spot on the bill as adults, like the entire complex. There is a red ring around the eye like in the lesser black-backed gull but unlike in the herring gull which has a dark yellow ring.

First-year birds have a paler head, rump and underparts than those of the herring gull, more closely resembling first-year great black-backed gulls in plumage. They have a dark bill and eyes, pinkish grey legs, dark flight feathers and a well-defined black band on the tail. They become lighter in the underparts and lose the upperpart pattern subsequently. By their second winter, birds are essentially feathered like adults, save for the patterned feathers remaining on the wing coverts. However, their bill tips are black, their eyes still dark, and the legs are a light yellow flesh colour.

The call is a loud laugh which is deeper and more nasal than the call of the herring gull.

==Diet==
Like most &quot;Larus&quot; gulls, they are omnivores and opportunistic foragers. They will scavenge on rubbish tips and elsewhere, as well as seeking suitable prey in fields or on the coast, or robbing smaller gulls and other seabirds of their catches. Although urban populations are generally opportunistic scavengers, they can shift to a predatory diet if necessary; this was observed during the lockdown of Italy in 2020, when the lack of food scraps led the yellow-legged gulls of Rome to take prey as large as rats and rock doves.

Atlantic gulls in Gibraltar have been observed and photographed picking and eating fruit from olive trees in flight.

==Reproduction==

Yellow-legged gulls usually breed in colonies. Eggs, usually three, are laid from mid March to early May and are defended vigorously by this large gull. The nest is a sometimes sparse mound of vegetation built on the ground or on cliff ledges. In some places, such as Gibraltar, Galicia and Portugal, they have started nesting on buildings, inside cities and even on trees. The eggs are incubated for 27–31 days and the young birds fledge after 35–40 days.

<text>The Caspian gull (Larus cachinnans) is a large gull and a member of the herring and lesser black-backed gull complex. The scientific name is from Latin. &quot;Larus&quot; appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird, and &quot;cachinnans&quot; means &#x27;laughing&#x27;, from &quot;cachinnare&quot; &#x27;to laugh&#x27;.

==Description==
It is a large gull at long, with a wingspan and a body mass of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . The Caspian gull has a long, slender bill, accentuated by the sloping forehead. The legs, wings, and neck are longer than those of the herring gull and yellow-legged gull. The eye is small and often dark, and the legs vary from pale pink to a pale yellowish colour. The back and wings are a slightly darker shade of grey than the herring gull, but slightly paler than the yellow-legged gull. The outermost primary feather has a large white tip and a white tongue running up the inner web.

First-winter birds have a pale head with dark streaking on the back of the neck. The underparts are pale and the back is greyish. The greater and median wing coverts have whitish tips forming two pale lines across the wing.

==Distribution==
The Caspian gull breeds around the Black and Caspian Seas, extending eastwards across Central Asia to north-west China. In Europe, it has been spreading north and west and now breeds in Poland, eastern Germany, southern Russia and all year round in Ukraine. Some birds migrate south as far as the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, while others disperse into Western Europe, in countries such as Sweden, Norway and Denmark or the Benelux and even North of France. Small numbers are now seen regularly in Britain, especially in South-east England, East Anglia, and the Midlands.

== Breeding ==

It typically nests on flat, low-lying ground by water, unlike the yellow-legged gull, which mainly nests on cliffs in areas where the two overlap. The breeding season starts from early April. Two or three eggs are laid and incubated for 27 to 31 days.

==Feeding==
They are scavengers and predators with a very varied diet. During the breeding season, they often eat rodents such as ground squirrels, flying some distance into the steppes to find them.

==Classification and subspecies==
This form has a troubled taxonomic history, summarised in the herring gull article. The Caspian gull used to be treated as a subspecies of the herring gull, but it is now treated as a full species by many authorities (e.g. the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union records committee). Some authorities include the yellow-legged gull (&quot;L. michahellis&quot;) within &quot;L. cachinnans&quot;, but it is also now commonly considered to be a separate species.

The steppe gull or Baraba gull (&quot;L. (cachinnans) barabensis&quot;) may be regarded as a subspecies of the Caspian gull or as a separate species. It is also very similar genetically to its northern neighbour, the &quot;taimyrensis&quot; race of Heuglin&#x27;s gull. The steppe gull breeds in Central Asia, particularly northern Kazakhstan. Its nonbreeding range is still little-known, but most are thought to winter in southwestern Asia from the Persian Gulf to northwestern India. There are possible records of this form from Hong Kong and South Korea.

The Mongolian gull (&quot;L. (vegae/cachinnans) mongolicus&quot;) may be classed as a subspecies of the Caspian gull, a subspecies of the Vega gull, or as a species in its own right. It breeds in Mongolia and the surrounding areas and migrates southeast in winter.

<text>Oakland is a town in Kennebec County in the U.S. state of Maine. The population was 6,230 at the 2020 census. Oakland is 4 miles (6 km) west of Waterville and approximately 18 miles (29 km) north of Augusta, the state capital. Waterville and Augusta are service centers for Oakland, and many Oakland residents commute to jobs in those areas.

==History==

The area that is now Oakland was first settled in about 1780 by colonists of English descent from Massachusetts and New Hampshire. At that time, the region was known as Taconnet after Indian Chief Taconnet, an Abenaki nation sachem. Farmers found the area&#x27;s fertile soil good for cultivation, grazing and dairy farming, while the water power provided by the Messalonskee Stream was useful for manufacturers. The area was incorporated by the Massachusetts General Court in 1771 as part of Winslow. In 1802, the area of Winslow west of the Kennebec River was incorporated as Waterville.

The Androscoggin and Kennebec Railroad arrived in 1849, spurring Waterville to boom as a mill town. With several manufacturers of farm implements, it became known as the axe and scythe capital of New England. Other factories produced canned goods, tinware, carriages, furniture, tools, machinery, woolens, lumber, coffins, leather, boots and shoes. There was a granite quarry.

In the 1870s, manufacturers in the western section of Waterville, unhappy with taxation in the town, petitioned the Maine State Legislature to designate their industrial district as a separate town. In 1872, Oakland became the southern terminal of the Somerset Railroad, connecting first to North Anson, then to Bingham, and finally to Moosehead Lake. On February 26, 1873, the area was incorporated as West Waterville. In 1883, it was renamed Oakland.

The town&#x27;s ponds and lakes are home to a number of summer camps. Downtown contains some notable architecture, including Memorial Hall, built in 1870, and the Oakland Public Library, a Carnegie library built between 1913 and 1915. Both are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The completion of Interstate 95 in the 1960s increased Oakland&#x27;s relationship with the Augusta area, and to some extent the Greater Portland and Bangor areas.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Oakland is drained by four major waterways: McGrath Pond, Salmon Lake, East Pond and Messalonskee Lake and Stream.

The town is crossed by Interstate 95, and state routes 11, 23, 41 and 137. It borders the towns of Belgrade to the southwest, Smithfield to the northwest, Fairfield to the north, Waterville to the southeast, and Sidney to the south.

<doc id="376393" wikidata="Q1771297" url="?curid=376393" title="English folk music">
<text>The folk music of England is a tradition-based music which has existed since the later medieval period. It is often contrasted with courtly, classical and later commercial music. Folk music traditionally was preserved and passed on orally within communities, but print and subsequently audio recordings have since become the primary means of transmission. The term is used to refer both to English traditional music and music composed or delivered in a traditional style.

There are distinct regional and local variations in content and style, particularly in areas more removed from the most prominent English cities, as in Northumbria, or the West Country. Cultural interchange and processes of migration mean that English folk music, although in many ways distinctive, has significant crossovers with the music of Scotland. When English communities migrated to the United States, Canada and Australia, they brought their folk traditions with them, and many of the songs were preserved by immigrant communities.

English folk music has produced or contributed to several cultural phenomena, including sea shanties, jigs, hornpipes and the music for Morris dancing. It has also interacted with other musical traditions, particularly classical and rock music, influencing musical styles and producing musical fusions, such as British folk rock, folk punk and folk metal. There remains a flourishing sub-culture of English folk music, which continues to influence other genres and occasionally gains mainstream attention.

==History==

===Origins===
In the strictest sense, English folk music has existed since the arrival of the Anglo-Saxon people in Britain after 400 AD. The Venerable Bede&#x27;s story of the cattleman and later ecclesiastical musician Cædmon indicates that in the early medieval period it was normal at feasts to pass around the harp and sing &#x27;vain and idle songs&#x27;. Since this type of music was rarely notated, we have little knowledge of its form or content. Some later tunes, like those used for Morris dance, may have their origins in this period, but it is impossible to be certain of these relationships. We know from a reference in William Langland&#x27;s &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, that ballads about Robin Hood were being sung from at least the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material we have is Wynkyn de Worde&#x27;s collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.

===16th century to the 18th century===
While there was distinct court music, members of the social elite into the 16th century also seem to have enjoyed, and even to have contributed to the music of the people, as Henry VIII perhaps did with the tavern song &quot;Pastime with Good Company&quot;. Peter Burke argued that late medieval social elites had their own culture, but were culturally &#x27;amphibious&#x27;, able to participate in and affect popular traditions.

In the 16th century the changes in the wealth and culture of the upper social orders caused tastes in music to diverge. There was an internationalisation of courtly music in terms of both instruments, such as the lute, dulcimer and early forms of the harpsichord, and in form with the development of madrigals, pavanes and galliards. For other social orders, instruments like the pipe, tabor, bagpipe, shawm, hurdy-gurdy, and crumhorn accompanied traditional music and community dance. The fiddle, well established in England by the 1660s, was unusual in being a key element in both the art music that developed in the baroque, and in popular song and dance.

By the mid-17th century, the music of the lower social orders was sufficiently alien to the aristocracy and &quot;middling sort&quot; for a process of rediscovery to be needed in order to understand it, along with other aspects of popular culture such as festivals, folklore and dance. This led to a number of early collections of printed material, including those published by John Playford as &quot;The English Dancing Master&quot; (1651), and the private collections of Samuel Pepys (1633–1703) and the Roxburghe Ballads collected by Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer (1661–1724). Pepys notably mentioned in his famous diary singing the ballad Barbara Allen on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1665, a ballad that survived in the oral tradition well into the twentieth century.

In the 18th century there were increasing numbers of collections of what was now beginning to be defined as &quot;folk&quot; music, strongly influenced by the Romantic movement, including Thomas D&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s &quot;Wit and Mirth: or, Pills to Purge Melancholy&quot; (1719–20) and Bishop Thomas Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot; (1765). The last of these also contained some oral material and by the end of the 18th century this was becoming increasingly common, with collections including Joseph Ritson&#x27;s, &quot;The Bishopric Garland&quot; (1784), which paralleled the work of figures like Robert Burns and Walter Scott in Scotland.It was in this period, too, that English folk music traveled across the Atlantic Ocean and became one of the foundations of American traditional music. In the colonies, it mixed with styles of music brought by other immigrant groups to create a host of new genres. For instance, English ballads, along with Irish, Scottish, and German musical traditions when combined with the African banjo, Afro-American rhythmic traditions and the Afro-American jazz and blues aesthetic led in part to the development of bluegrass and country music.

===Early 19th century===
With the Industrial Revolution the themes of the music of the labouring classes began to change from rural and agrarian life to include industrial work songs. Awareness that older kinds of song were being abandoned prompted renewed interest in collecting folk songs during the 1830s and 1840s, including the work of William Sandys&#x27; &quot;Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern&quot; (1833), William Chappell, &quot;A Collection of National English Airs&quot; (1838) and Robert Bell&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Poems, Ballads and Songs of the Peasantry of England&quot; (1846).

Technological change made new instruments available and led to the development of silver and brass bands, particularly in industrial centres in the north. The shift to urban centres also began to create new types of music, including from the 1850s the Music hall, which developed from performances in ale houses into theatres and became the dominant locus of English popular music for over a century. This combined with increased literacy and print to allow the creation of new songs that initially built on, but began to differ from traditional music as composers like Lionel Monckton and Sidney Jones created music that reflected new social circumstances.

===Folk revivals 1890–1969===

From the late 19th century there were a series of movements that attempted to collect, record, preserve and later to perform, English folk music and dance. These are usually separated into two folk revivals.

The first, in the later 19th and early 20th centuries, involved figures including collectors Sabine Baring-Gould (1834–1924), Frank Kidson (1855–1926), Lucy Broadwood (1858–1939), and Anne Gilchrist (1863–1954), centred around the Folk Song Society, founded in 1911. Francis James Child&#x27;s (1825–96) eight-volume collection &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot; (1882–92) became the most influential in defining the repertoire of subsequent performers, and Cecil Sharp (1859–1924), founder of the English Folk Dance Society, was probably the most important figure in understanding of the nature of folk song. The revival was part of a wider national movement in the period around the First World War, and contributed to the creation of the English Pastoral School of classical music which incorporated traditional songs or motifs, as can be seen in the compositions of Percy Grainger (1882–1961), Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872–1951), George Butterworth (1885–1916), Gustav Holst (1874–1934) and Frederick Delius (1862–1934). In 1932 the Folk-Song Society and the English Folk Dance Society merged to become the English Folk Dance and Song Society (EFDSS). Some of these revivalists recorded folk songs on wax cylinders, and many of the recordings, including Percy Grainger&#x27;s collection, are available online courtesy of the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library and the British Library Sound Archive. 
The second revival gained momentum after the Second World War, following on from the American folk music revival as new forms of media and American commercial music appeared to pose another threat to traditional music. The key figures were Ewan MacColl and A. L. Lloyd. The second revival was generally left wing in politics and emphasised the work music of the 19th century and previously neglected forms like erotic folk songs. Topic Records, founded in 1939, provided a major source of folk recordings. The revival resulted in the foundation of a network of folk clubs in major towns, from the 1950s. Major traditional performers included The Watersons, the Ian Campbell Folk Group, and Shirley Collins. The fusing of various styles of American music with English folk also helped to create a distinctive form of guitar fingerstyle known as &#x27;folk baroque&#x27;, which was pioneered by Davy Graham, Martin Carthy, John Renbourn and Bert Jansch. Several individuals emerged who had learnt the old songs in the oral tradition from their communities and therefore preserved the authentic versions. These people, including Sam Larner, Harry Cox, Fred Jordan, Walter Pardon, Frank Hinchliffe and the Copper Family, released albums of their own and were revered by folk revivalists. Popular folk revival musicians based their works on songs sung by these traditional singers and those collected during the first folk revival.

There are various databases and collections of English folk songs collected during the first and second folk revivals, such as the Roud Folk Song Index, which contains references to 25,000 English language folk songs, and the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library, a multimedia archive of folk-related resources. The British Library Sound Archive contains thousands of recordings of traditional English folk music, including 340 wax cylinder recordings made by Percy Grainger in the early 1900s.

===Progressive folk===
The process of fusion between American musical styles and English folk can also be seen as the origin of British progressive folk music, which attempted to elevate folk music through greater musicianship, or compositional and arrangement skills. Many progressive folk performers continued to retain a traditional element in their music, including Jansch and Renbourn, who with Jacqui McShee, Danny Thompson, and Terry Cox, formed Pentangle in 1967. Others totally abandoned the traditional element and in this area particularly influential were the Scottish artists Donovan, who was most influenced by emerging progressive folk musicians in America like Bob Dylan, and the Incredible String Band, who from 1967 incorporated a range of influences including medieval and eastern music into their compositions. Some of this, particularly the Incredible String Band, has been seen as developing into the further subgenre of psych or psychedelic folk and had a considerable impact on progressive and psychedelic rock.

There was a brief flowering of English progressive folk in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with groups like the Third Ear Band and Quintessence following the eastern Indian musical and more abstract work by group such as Comus, Dando Shaft, The Trees, Spirogyra, Forest, and Jan Dukes De Grey, but commercial success was elusive for these bands and most had broken up or moved in very different directions by about 1973. Perhaps the finest individual work in the genre was from artists early 1970s artists like Nick Drake and John Martyn, but these can also be considered the first among the English &#x27;folk troubadours&#x27; or &#x27;singer-songwriters&#x27;, individual performers who remained largely acoustic but who relied mostly on their own individual compositions. The most successful of these was Ralph McTell, whose &#x27;Streets of London&#x27; reached number 2 in the UK Single Charts in 1974, and whose music is clearly folk, but without much reliance on tradition, virtuosity, or much evidence of attempts at fusion with other genres.

===British folk rock===

British folk rock developed in Britain during the mid to late 1960s by the bands Fairport Convention, and Pentangle which built on elements of American folk rock, and on the second British folk revival. It uses traditional music, and compositions in a traditional style, played on a combination of rock and traditional instruments. It was most significant in the 1970s, when it was taken up by groups such as Pentangle, Steeleye Span and the Albion Band. It was rapidly adopted and developed in the surrounding Celtic cultures of Brittany, where it was pioneered by Alan Stivell and bands like Malicorne; in Ireland by groups such as Horslips; in Canada by groups such as Barde; and also in Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man and Cornwall, to produce Celtic rock and its derivatives. It has been influential in those parts of the world with close cultural connections to Britain, such as the US and Canada and gave rise to the subgenre of Medieval folk rock and the fusion genres of folk punk and folk metal. By the 1980s the genre was in steep decline in popularity, but has survived and revived in significance as part of a more general folk resurgence since the 1990s.

===Folk punk===
In the mid-1980s a new rebirth of English folk began, this time fusing folk with energy and political aggression derived from punk rock. Leaders included The Pogues, The Men They Couldn&#x27;t Hang, Oyster Band and Billy Bragg. Folk dance music also became popular in the 80s, with acts like the English Country Blues Band and Tiger Moth. The decade later saw the use of reggae with English folk music by the band Edward II &amp; the Red Hot Polkas, especially on their seminal &quot;Let&#x27;s Polkasteady&quot; from 1987.

===Folk metal===

In a process strikingly similar to the origins of British folk rock in the 1960s, the English thrash metal band Skyclad added violins from a session musician on several tracks for their 1990 debut album &quot;The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth&quot;. When this was well received they adopted a full-time fiddle player and moved towards a signature folk and jig style leading them to be credited as the pioneers of folk metal, which has spread to Ireland, the Baltic and Germany.

===Traditional folk resurgence 1990–present===
The peak of traditional English folk, like progressive and electric folk, was the mid- to late-1970s, when, for a time it threatened to break through into the mainstream. By the end of the decade, however, it was in decline. The attendance at, and numbers of folk clubs began to decrease, probably as new musical and social trends, including punk rock, new wave and electronic music began to dominate. Although many acts like Martin Carthy and the Watersons continued to perform successfully, there were very few significant new acts pursuing traditional forms in the 1980s. This began to change with a new generation in the 1990s. The arrival and sometimes mainstream success of acts like Kate Rusby, Bellowhead, Nancy Kerr, Kathryn Tickell, Jim Moray, Spiers and Boden, Seth Lakeman, Frank Turner, Laura Marling and Eliza Carthy, all largely concerned with acoustic performance of traditional material, marked a radical turn around in the fortunes of the tradition. This was reflected in the adoption creation of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2000, which gave the music a much needed status and focus and the profile of folk music is as high in England today as it has been for over thirty years.

==Folk clubs==
Although there were a handful of clubs that allowed space for the performance of traditional folk music by the early 1950s, its major boost came from the short-lived British skiffle craze, from about 1956–8. New clubs included the &#x27;Ballad and Blues&#x27; club in a pub in Soho, co-founded by Ewan MacColl. As the craze subsided from the mid-1950s many of these clubs began to shift towards the performance of English traditional folk material. Many became strict &#x27;policy clubs&#x27;, that pursued a pure and traditional form of music. By the mid-1960s there were probably over 300 in Britain. Most clubs were simply a regular gathering, usually in the back or upstairs room of a public house on a weekly basis. They were largely a phenomenon of the urbanised middle classes and known for the amateur nature of many performances. There were also &#x27;residents&#x27;, who performed regular short sets of songs. Many of these later emerged as major performers in their own right, including A. L. Lloyd, Martin Carthy, and Shirley Collins. A later generation of performers used the folk club circuit for highly successful mainstream careers, including Billy Connolly, Jasper Carrott, Ian Dury and Barbara Dickson. The number of clubs began to decline in the 1980s, in the face of changing musical and social trends. But the decline began to stabilize in the mid-1990s with the resurgence of interest in folk music and there are now over 160 folk clubs in the United Kingdom, including many that can trace their origins back to the 1950s.

==Folk music and the radio==
The difficulty of gaining regular appearances on television in England has long meant that radio has remained the major popular medium for increasing awareness of the genre. The EFDSS sponsored the BBC Home Service radio program, &quot;As I Roved Out&quot;, based on field recordings made by Peter Kennedy and Séamus Ennis from 1952 to 1958, which probably did more than any other single factor to introduce the general population to British folk music in the period. Also important were occasional radio shows, such as Lomax&#x27;s &quot;Ballads and Blues&quot; (1951), MacColl&#x27;s &quot;Radio-ballads&quot; (1958–64) and &quot;The Song Carriers&quot; (1968). John Peel frequently included folk music of his &quot;Top Gear&quot; show on Radio One from 1968, but dropped it when punk arrived in the 1970s. The most consistent source of folk music on radio, has been BBC Radio 2. In 1967 &quot;My Kind of folk&quot; was broadcast on Wednesdays. In 1970 &quot;Folk on Friday&quot; began, presented by Jim Lloyd. In 1972 it became &quot;Folk on Sunday&quot;. &quot;Folkweave&quot; was presented by Tony Capstick 1975–8. &quot;Folk on Two&quot; (Wednesdays) began in 1980. In 1998 Jim Lloyd retired from the programme and was replaced by Mike Harding. In 2007 it was renamed &quot;The Mike Harding Folk Show&quot;. In October 2012 it was announced that Mike Harding would be leaving the programme to be replaced by Mark Radcliffe. Ian A. Anderson, editor of &quot;fRoots&quot;, also presented the occasional series for Radio Two. He hosted a World music programme on &quot;Jazz FM&quot; and then spent 10 years broadcasting on the BBC World Service. He currently hosts &quot;fRoots Radio&quot; on the web. For over twenty years, until 2006, Charlie Gillett presented World music on BBC London.

==Folk festivals==

Folk festivals began to be organised by the EFDSS from about 1950, usually as local or regional event with an emphasis on dance, like the Sidmouth Festival (from 1955) and the Keele Festival (1965), which was abandoned in 1981 but reinstituted three years later as the National Folk Festival. The EFDSS gave up its organizing role in these festivals in the 1980s and most are locally run and financed. One of the largest and most prestigious English folk festivals at Cambridge was founded in 1965 and attracts about 10,000 people. Probably the largest is Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention, which since 1979 has provided a venue for folk, British folk rock, and rock artists; it now attracts up to 20,000 people a year as well as performances for Fairport Convention and their friends. Like rock festivals, folk festivals have begun to multiply since the 1990s and there are over a hundred folk festivals or varying sizes held in England every year.

==Forms of folk music==

===Ballads===
A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative story and set to music. Many ballads were written and sold as single sheet broadsides. They are usually narrative in structure and make considerable use of repetition. The traditional ballad has been seen as originating with the wandering minstrels of late medieval Europe. There have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme, but commonly identified types are religious, supernatural, tragic, love, historic, legends and humour. Many ballads were brought by English settlers to the New World, thus contributing in part to the bedrock of American folk music that had been established via the Afro-American rhythmic traditions, the blues aesthetic, and the cross-pollination of the American immigrant cultures at the time.

===Carols===
A carol is a festive song. In modern times, carols are associated primarily with Christmas, but in reality there are carols celebrating all festivals and seasons of the year, and not necessarily Christian festivals. They were derived from a form of circle dance accompanied by singers, which was popular from the mid-12th century. From the 14th century they were used as processional songs, particularly at Advent, Easter and Christmas, and to accompany religious mystery plays. They declined after the Protestant Reformation which banned many religious festivals, but some famous carols were written in this period, including &#x27;The Holly and the Ivy&#x27; and they were more strongly revived from the 19th century and began to be written and adapted by eminent composers.

===Children&#x27;s songs===

The earliest vernacular children&#x27;s songs in Europe are lullabies from the later medieval period. From soon after we have records of short children&#x27;s rhyming songs, but most nursery rhymes were not written down until the 18th century. The first English collections were &quot;Tommy Thumb&#x27;s Song Book&quot; and a sequel, &quot;Tommy Thumb&#x27;s Pretty Song Book&quot;, are both thought to have been published before 1744, and John Newbery&#x27;s, &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle&quot; (c.1785), is the first record we have of many classic rhymes. These rhymes seem to have come from a variety of sources, including traditional riddles, proverbs, ballads, lines of Mummers&#x27; plays, drinking songs, historical events, and, it has been suggested, ancient pagan rituals. Roughly half of the current body recognised &#x27;traditional&#x27; English rhymes were known by the mid-18th century. From this period we sometimes know the origins and authors of rhymes, like &#x27;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&#x27;, which combined an 18th-century French tune with a poem by English writer Jane Taylor and &#x27;Mary Had a Little Lamb&#x27;, written by Sarah Josepha Hale of Boston in 1830. The first, and possibly the most important collection to focus in this area was, James Orchard Halliwell&#x27;s, &quot;The Nursery Rhymes of England&quot; (1842) and &quot;Popular Rhymes and Tales&quot; in 1849. At the height of the revival Sabine Baring-Gould produced &quot;A Book of Nursery Songs&quot; (1895), and Andrew Lang produced &quot;The Nursery Rhyme Book&quot; in 1897. Children&#x27;s songs, unlike folk songs, have remained part of a living and continuous tradition, for although added to from other sources and affected by written versions, most adults pass on songs they learned from oral sources as children.

===Erotic folk songs===
It has been noted by most recent commentators on English folk song even if it was a bit immoral, that love, the erotic and even the pornographic, were major traditional themes and, if more than ballads are considered, may have been the largest groups of printed songs. Many collectors in the first revival either ignored such songs, or bowdlerized them for publication, as Francis Child and Cecil Sharp did in their collections. In the second revival, erotic folk song was much more accepted as part of the canon of traditional song, helped by the publication of books such as Gershon Legman&#x27;s, &quot;The Horn Book: Studies in Erotic Folklore&quot; (1964) and Ed Cray&#x27;s, &quot;The Erotic Muse: American Bawdy Songs&quot;, which printed many previously unpublished songs (1968). In England A. L. Lloyd was the key figure in introducing erotic songs to the canon, lecturing and publishing on the subject. He recorded &quot;The Foggy Dew and Other Traditional English Love Songs&quot; in 1959, and then &quot;The Bird in the Bush, Traditional Erotic Songs&quot; in 1966 with Frankie Armstrong, and Anne Briggs. He drew a distinction between erotic songs, i.e. those that dealt with love and suggested sexuality through innuendo (like &#x27;The Bonny Black Hare&#x27; and &#x27;The Bird in the Bush&#x27;), and pornographic songs that were explicit and therefore unworthy of attention. Some authors, however, find these distinctions more difficult to maintain. Although erotic songs became part of the standard fare in folk clubs and among folk rock musicians, relatively few of the more explicit songs have been placed on record.

===Hornpipes===
The hornpipe is a style of dance music thought to have taken its name from an English reed instrument by at least the 17th century. In the mid-18th century it changed from 3/2 time to 2/2, assuming its modern character, and probably reaching the height of its popularity as it became a staple of theatrical performances. It is most often associated with the Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe, but has formed the basis of many individual and group country dances into the modern period. Like many dances it was taken up in Scotland and Ireland and given a distinctive national character and moved to America with emigration.

===Jigs===

Jigs are a style of dance music developed in England to accompany a lively dance with steps, turns and leaps. The term jig was derived from the French &#x27;giguer&#x27;, meaning &#x27;to jump&#x27;. It was known as a dance in the 16th century, often in time and the term was used for a dancing entertainment in 16th century plays. The dance began to be associated with music particularly in time, and with slip jigs time. In the 17th century the dance was adopted in Ireland and Scotland, where they were widely adapted, and with which countries they are now most often associated. In some, usually more northern, parts of England, these dances would be referred to as a &quot;Gallop&quot; – such as the Winster Gallop from Derbyshire (though this owes its origins to the Winster Morris).

===Morris dance===

A morris dance is a type of English folk dance, usually accompanied by music, and based on rhythmic stepping and the execution of choreographed figures by a group of dancers, often using implements such as sticks, swords, and handkerchiefs. The name is thought to derive from the term &#x27;moorish dance&#x27;, for Spanish (Muslim) styles of dance and may derive from English court dances of the period. References have been found that suggest that morris dance dates back to the mid-15th century, but claims of pre-Christian origins are now largely dismissed. Morris dance appears to have been widespread in England by the early 17th century, particularly in pastoral areas, but was suppressed, along with associated festivals during and after the English Civil War. It recovered after the Restoration in 1660 but was in steep decline after agricultural and industrial revolutions by the 19th century, when collectors like Cecil Sharp recorded the practice, particularly from versions of dance he found in the Cotswolds. This led to a revival of the tradition, although it may also have affected form and practice. Morris dance took something of a back seat to unaccompanied singing in the second revival, but received a further boost when it attracted the attention of British folk rock musicians like Ashley Hutchings, who produced several albums of dance music, including the influential &quot;Morris On&quot; series from 1972. Traditionally Morris dance was accompanied by either a pipe and tabor or a fiddle, but from the mid-19th century most common instruments were the melodeon, accordion, concertina and drums. Particularly in Cotswold and Border morris, many tunes are linked to particular dances. Morris dance survives in the distinct local traditions of Cotswold morris, north-west morris, Border Morris, rapper dance and Long Sword dance.

===Protest songs===
Perhaps the oldest clear example of an English protest song is the rhyme &#x27;When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?&#x27;, used in the Peasants Revolt of 1381. Songs that celebrated social bandits like Robin Hood, from the 14th century onwards can be seen as a more subtle form of protest. With the Levellers and Diggers in the mid-17th century, more overt criticism surfaced, as in the ballad &quot;The Diggers&#x27; Song&quot;. From roughly the same period, songs of protest at war, pointing out the costs to human lives, also begin to appear, like &quot;The Maunding Souldier or The Fruits of Warre is Beggery&quot;, framed as a begging appeal from a crippled soldier of the Thirty Years War. With industrialisation from the 18th century. A surprising English folk hero immortalised in song is Napoleon Bonaparte, in songs such as the &quot;Bonny Bunch of Roses&quot; and &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Dream&quot;. As labour became more organised songs were used as anthems and propaganda, for miners with songs like &quot;The Black Leg Miner&quot;, and for factory workers with songs like &quot;The Factory Bell&quot;. These industrial protest songs were largely ignored during the first English folk revival of the later 19th and early 20th century, but were recorded by figures like A. L. Lloyd on albums such as &quot;The Iron Muse&quot; (1963). In the 1980s the anarchist rock band Chumbawamba recorded several versions of traditional English protest as &quot;English Rebel Songs 1381–1914&quot;. Ewan MacColl became the leading writer of English protest songs in the 1950s, with pro-communist songs such as &quot;The Ballad of Ho Chi Minh&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Stalin&quot;, as well as volatile protest and topical songs concerning the nuclear threat to peace, most notably &quot;Against the Atom Bomb&quot;. The leading voice of protest in Thatcherite Britain in the 1980s was Billy Bragg, whose style of protest song and grass-roots political activism was mostly reminiscent of those of Woody Guthrie.

===Sea shanties===

Sea shanties are a type of work song traditionally sung by sailors. Derived from the French word &#x27;chanter&#x27;, meaning &#x27;to sing&#x27;, they may date from as early as the 15th century, but most recorded examples derive from the 19th century. Shanties were usually slow rhythmic songs designed to help with collective tasks on labour-intensive sailing and later steam ships. Many were call and response songs, with one voice (the shantyman) singing a lead line and the rest of the sailors giving a response together. They were derived from varied sources, including dances, folk songs, polkas, waltzes and even West African work-songs. Since different songs were useful for different tasks they are traditionally divided into three main categories, short haul shanties, for tasks requiring quick pulls over a relatively short time; halyard shanties, for heavier work requiring more set-up time between pulls; and Capstan shanties, for long, repetitive tasks requiring a sustained rhythm, but not involving working the lines. Famous shanties include, the &#x27;Blow the Man Down and &#x27;Bound for South Australia&#x27;, some of which have remained in the public consciousness or been revived by popular recordings. There was some interest in sea shanties in the first revival from figures like Percy Grainger, who recorded several traditional versions on phonographs. In the second revival A. L. Lloyd attempted to popularise them, recording several albums of sea songs from 1965.

===War songs===
In England songs about military and naval subjects were a major part of the output of ballad writers from the 16th century onwards, including one of the earliest British ballads &#x27;The Ballad of Chevy Chase&#x27;, which deals with the events of the Scottish victory of the Battle of Otterburn in 1388 and may date to the early 15th century. The conflicts between England and Spain in the later 16th and early 17th centuries produced a number of ballads describing events, particularly naval conflicts like those of the Spanish Armada. The English Civil War (1642–1653) produced a subgenre of &quot;Cavalier ballads&quot;, including &quot;When the King Home in Peace Again&quot;. Many of these were adapted and reused by Jacobites after the &#x27;Glorious Revolution&#x27; of 1688. The Anglo-French Wars of the 17th and 18th centuries saw more descriptive works, usually couched in patriotic terms, but some, like &#x27;Captain Death&#x27; (1757) dealt with loss and defeat. As regimental identities emerged songs were adopted for marching, like &#x27;The British Grenadiers&#x27;, based on a 17th-century dance tune. Output became a flood during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1797–1815), seeing numerous patriotic war songs, like &#x27;Heart of Oak&#x27; and the emergence of a stereotype of the English seaman as &#x27;Jolly Jack Tar&#x27;, who appeared in many ballads and on stage. As the musical hall began to take over the lead in popular music and folk song declined, folk song ceased to deal with contemporary wars in the later 19th century.

===Work songs===
Work songs include music sung while conducting a task (often to coordinate timing) or a song linked to a task or trade which might be a connected narrative, description, or protest song. The two main types of work song in England are agricultural work songs, usually are rhythmic a cappella songs sung by people working on a physical and often repetitive task, like the &#x27;Harvest song&#x27; common in south-west England. The songs were probably intended to increase productivity while reducing feelings of boredom. Rhythms of work songs can serve to synchronize physical movement in a group or gang. Industrial folk song emerged in Britain in the 18th century, as workers took the music with which they were familiar, including ballads and agricultural work songs, and adapted them to their new experiences and circumstances. Unlike agricultural work songs, it was often unnecessary to use music to synchronise actions between workers, as the pace would be increasingly determined by water, steam, chemical and eventually electric power, and frequently impossible because of the noise of early industry. As a result, industrial folk songs tended to be descriptive of work, circumstances, or political in nature, making them amongst the earliest protest songs and were sung between work shifts or in leisure hours, rather than during work. This pattern can be seen in textile production, mining and eventually steel, shipbuilding, rail working and other industries.

==Regional traditions==

===East Anglia===
Like many regions of England there are few distinctive local instruments and many songs were shared with the rest of Britain and with Ireland, although the distinct dialects of the regions sometimes lent them a particular stamp and, with one of the longest coastlines of any English region, songs about the sea were also particularly important. Along with the West Country, this was one of the regions that most firmly adopted reed instruments, producing many eminent practitioners of the melodeon from the mid-19th century. Also like the West Country it is one of the few regions where there is still an active tradition of step dancing and like the Midlands the tradition of Molly dance died out in the 1930s. The region was relatively neglected by folk song collectors of the first revival. Lucy Broadwood and Cecil Sharp collected in Cambridgeshire, as did and Vaughan Williams as well as in Norfolk and Essex from 1905, but most important regional figure was composer Ernest John Moeran, who collected over 150 songs in Norfolk and Suffolk in the 1920s. The second folk revival led to the discovery of many East Anglian folk musicians, including Suffolk melodeon player Oscar Woods, Norfolk singers Sam Larner (1878–1965), Harry Cox (1885–1971) and Walter Pardon (1914–96); Suffolk fiddler Harkie Nesling (1890–1978); Suffolk singer and bargeman Bob Roberts (1907–82), many of whom recorded for Topic Records. Perhaps the most influential folk dance musical album was &quot;English Country Dance Music&quot; (1965), put together by Reg Hall and Bob Davenport with largely Norfolk musicians, it was the first instrumental recording of folk instruments. Also from Norfolk was Peter Bellamy, who in solo projects, with the Young Tradition and in theatrical productions was probably one of the most influential musicians of the post revival period. The Norfolk melodeon player and singer Tony Hall has given the tradition a unique style. East Anglia made a contribution to the British folk rock scene of the 1970s, producing the short-lived, but more recently reformed, bands Midwinter and Stone Angel, based in Great Yarmouth and the more successful Spriguns of Tolgus from Cambridge, who produced four albums. The most successful folk artists from the region in recent years are probably the Essex born Billy Bragg and the Norfolk born Beth Orton. The region is home to numerous folk clubs and hosts many folk festivals, including Steeleye Span&#x27;s Spanfest at Kentwell Hall, Suffolk and the Cambridge Folk Festival, generally seen as the most prestigious in the calendar. Since 2000 the East Anglian Traditional Music Trust has been promoting folk music in the region, organising a &#x27;Traditional Music Day&#x27; every year in August.

===The Midlands===
Due to its lack of clear boundaries and a perceived lack of identity in its folk music, the English Midlands attracted relatively little interest in the early revivals. However, in more recent years a distinct cultural heritage has been recognised including unique folk traditions and songs, many associated with the regions industrial connections. It has also produced a number of important performers and some particular local instruments, such as the Lincolnshire bagpipes, however the last player, John Hunsley, died in the 19th century and no actual examples of the pipes have survived. From the 19th century the instruments used appear to have been much like those in other regions, with fiddles, accordions and eventually silver and brass. Although, some traditions, like Molly dance died out in the 1930s, the Midlands retained strong traditions of both ceremonial and social dance, particularly in the south Midlands and Cotswolds and in the distinctive Border Morris from Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. The region also furnished some important material for folk songs, including a claim by Nottinghamshire for one of the most popular series of ballads, that of Robin Hood, while local places appear in songs such as &#x27;The Leicester Chambermaid&#x27; and &#x27;Oxford&#x27; or &#x27;Worcester City&#x27;. Folk song collecting in the first revival was much less comprehensive than for many other regions. In the 1860s Llewellynn Jewitt, collected songs from Derbyshire, and some songs were printed by Georgina F. Jackson in her study of Shropshire folk lore. Cecil Sharp&#x27;s interest in the region was largely confined to the south, particularly the Cotswold morris villages of Oxfordshire and Warwickshire, which provided him with an archetype of English ceremonial dance. From 1905, Percy Grainger was actively collecting in Lincolnshire, acquiring recordings of songs that would provide the basis for his &quot;Lincolnshire Posy&quot; (1937). It was not until the early 1970s that the broader heritage of the region, including the many industrial and work songs associated with mining or The Potteries, began to gain serious attention. Despite this neglect there was an active folk scene in the region, which produced several key artists of the second revival from the 1960s, including Anne Briggs from Nottinghamshire, The Settlers from the West Midlands and from Birmingham one of the most influential groups of the period, the Ian Campbell Folk Group, which numbered among its members later British folk rock musicians Dave Swarbrick and Dave Pegg. Slightly later a number of folk groups came out of Derbyshire, including The Druids, Ram&#x27;s Bottom Band and Muckram Wakes, which included one of the most highly regarded modern performers John Tams. Lincolnshire has produced Martin Simpson, perhaps the most highly regarded folk guitarist of his generation. Birmingham&#x27;s position as a centre for folk music has been emphasised by its place as the home of the Birmingham Conservatoire Folk Ensemble, led by former Albion Band fiddler Joe Broughton, which provides something of a clearing house of promising young folk musicians. The regions has numerous folk clubs and host many major folk festivals, including those of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire; Loughborough, Leicestershire; Shrewsbury, Shropshire; Warwick, Warwickshire; and Moseley, West Midlands.

===The North West===
Although relatively neglected in the first folk revival North West England had a rich tradition of balladry stretching back at least to the 17th century and sharing in the tradition of Border ballads, including perhaps the finest &#x27;The Ballad of Chevy Chase&#x27;, thought to have been composed by the Lancashire-born sixteenth century minstrel Richard Sheale. Lancashire in particular was a common location for folk songs, including &#x27;The Lancashire Miller&#x27;, &#x27;Warrington Ale&#x27; and &#x27;The soldier&#x27;s farewell to Manchester&#x27;, beside several local Wassailing songs. With a variety of dialects and acting as something of a crossroads for the cultures and immigrants of England, Scotland and Ireland, there is a distinctive local character to folk music, which expressed itself in local enthusiasm that emerged as a major factor within the wider folk movement in the second revival. The key event in the history of folk music in the counties of the north west of England was the Industrial Revolution, which divided the region economically and culturally into a northern, often highland and pastoral region, in Westmorland and Cumberland and a more urbanised and industrialised southern zone with large and growing conurbations like Manchester and Liverpool, where changing social and economic patterns emerged in new traditions and styles of folk song, often linked to migration and patterns of work, these included processional dances, often associated with rushbearing and the Wakes Week festivities and types of step dance, most famously clog dancing. These were very different from the styles of dance that collectors like Cecil Sharp had encountered in the Cotswolds and were largely dismissed by him as contaminated by urbanisation, yet they were, and remain, a thriving tradition of music and dance. A local pioneer of folk song collection in the first half of the 19th century in Lancashire was Shakespearian scholar James Orchard Halliwell, and he was followed a little later by John Harland, William E. Axon, Thomas T. Wilkinson and Sidney Gilpin, who performed a similar service for Cumberland. Most of these works, although important in unearthing, and in some cases preserving, locally relevant ballads, largely depended on manuscript sources, rather than oral collection and often did not give tunes, but only lyrics. It was not until the second folk revival that the full range of song from the region began to gain attention. The region not only produced one of the major figures of the revival in Ewan MacColl but also a local champion in Harry Boardman, who from 1965 onwards probably did more than anyone to popularise and record the industrial folk song of the region, in several albums and books. The region produced no significant bands in the folk rock movement of the 1970s but can claim one of the most significant figures, as Maddy Prior was brought up in Blackpool. However, perhaps the most influential folk artists to emerge from the region in this period were folk troubadour Roy Harper and comedian and broadcaster Mike Harding. More recently it has produced some significant performers including guitarist Ken Nicol and mother and daughter singer songwriters Chris and Kellie While. The region is home to numerous folk clubs, many of them catering to Irish and Scots folk. Folk festivals include the Fylde Folk Festival at Fleetwood in Lancashire.

===Northumbria===

Northumbria possesses a distinctive style of folk music with a flourishing and continuing tradition. The region is particularly noted for the unique Northumbrian smallpipes and strong fiddle tradition that was already well-established in the 1690s. Northumbrian music is characterised by considerable influence from other regions, particularly southern Scotland, other parts of the north of England and Ireland. Local tunes were collected from the mid-18th century by figures including Henry Atkinson and William Vickers and in the first revival by John Bell, Bruce. J. Collingwood and John Stokoe. The short-lived Northumbrian Small Pipes Society was founded in Newcastle in 1893 and the Northumbrian Pipers&#x27; Society in 1928, and they are generally credited with keeping the distinctive tradition alive. Border ballads were a major part of those collected by Francis James Child and make up most of the sixth volume of his ten volume collection of &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot; (1882–98). The second folk revival saw a number of acts drawing on this work, and enjoying some success. Probably the most influential piper at that time was Billy Pigg. Performers such Louis Killen, The High Level Ranters and Bob Davenport brought Northumbrian folk to national and international audiences. The 1970s saw folk rock bands like Lindisfarne, and the more traditionally focused Jack the Lad and Hedgehog Pie. More recently, Northumbrian folk music, and particularly the use of the Northumbrian pipes, has become one of the liveliest and most widely known subgenres of folk music in Britain, with artists like fiddler Nancy Kerr, piper Kathryn Tickell and Rachel Unthank and the Winterset gaining international reputations. Currently the region has over thirty active folk clubs and hosts several major folk festivals, including the Traditional Music Festival at Rothbury.

===The South East===
Even excluding Sussex and London, South-east England has been one of the key areas of English folk music and collection. It had retained a strong tradition of wassailing, and seafaring songs were important in the coastal counties of Kent and Hampshire. Arguably the published collection of oral material was made in this area by John Broadwood, as &quot;Old English Songs, As Now Sung by the Peasantry of the Weald of Surrey and Sussex&quot; (1843). When the first revival was at its height in the first decade of the 20th century, George Gardiner and Alice Gillington both collected songs in Hampshire, Lucy Broadwood in Surrey, Hampshire and Oxfordshire, Alfred Williams in Oxfordshire and Berkshire and Cecil Sharp in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Kent. In the second folk revival the region contributed several figures, with probably the most important being Martin Carthy from Hertfordshire. The most significant British folk rock group from the region were the Oyster Band, formed in Canterbury, while guitarist John Martyn came from Surrey and fiddle player Chris Leslie from Banbury in Oxfordshire. From the current crop of young folk musicians probably the most prominent are Spiers and Boden from Oxfordshire and Chris Wood, born in Kent. The region is host to numerous folk clubs, and festivals, including the Oxford festival and Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention in Oxfordshire and St Albans in Hertfordshire.

====London====
Despite being the centre of both folk revivals and the British folk rock movement, the songs of London were largely neglected in favour of regional and rural music until relatively recently. London, unsurprisingly, was the most common location mentioned in English folk songs, including &#x27;London is a Fine Town&#x27;, and the &#x27;London Prentice&#x27; and it was the centre of the broadside publishing industry. From the 17th century to the 19th, street singers were characteristic of London life, often selling printed versions of the songs they sang. The capital is home to the Folk-Song Society and the English Folk Dance Society since the late 19th century (now known as the English Folk Dance and Song Society), but the most distinctive genre of London music, its many street cries, were not considered folk music by mainstream collectors and were recorded and published by figures such as Andrew White in &quot;Old London Street Cries ; and, The Cries of To-day&quot; (1885). Both Ewan MacColl and A. L. Lloyd gravitated to London in the 1950s, it was the base of Topic Records and it was there that the first folk clubs were formed before they spread out across the country. It was also the home of folk musicians like Ashley Hutchings, Richard Thompson and Simon Nicol who formed Fairport Convention, and many artists, like Bert Jansch and Davy Graham, moved there in order to be able to pursue their careers or for the greater networks and opportunities the capital allowed. More recent performers of folk music include Noah and the Whale, Emma Lee Moss, Mumford and Sons, The Border Surrender and Anna Tam.

====Sussex====
Sussex has disproportionately affected the history of English folk music. This was due to a flourishing tradition of folk dance, mummers plays and folk song, but also in part because of the rural nature of the county in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and yet its relatively close proximity to London. It was thus a rich and convenient place for the collectors of the first folk song revival, including Kate Lee, Lucy Broadwood and W. P. Merrick. Sussex material was used by the composers of the English pastoral school, for example in Percy Grainger&#x27;s arrangement of &#x27;The Sussex Mummers&#x27; Christmas Carol&#x27;, Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27; use of the tune &#x27;Monk&#x27;s Gate&#x27; as a setting for John Bunyan&#x27;s &#x27;To be a Pilgrim&#x27; and George Butterworth&#x27;s arrangement of &#x27;Folk Songs from Sussex&#x27;. Most important of the collector&#x27;s sources were the Copper Family of Rottingdean, who emerged as authorities on folk song and eventually as major recording artists. Sussex folk song also had a formative effect on one of the major figures of the second revival, as it was as a child of five in Sussex that A. L. Lloyd first heard folk music. Other performers include Scan Tester, Henry Burstow and the sisters Dolly and Shirley Collins. Sussex songs were also the foundation of the repertoire of the influential Young Tradition. The county has over twenty folk clubs and other venues hosting folk music by organisations such as Acoustic Sussex. There are also annual folk music festivals at Eastbourne, Crawley and Lewes.

===The West Country===

====Cornwall====

The music of Cornwall is often noted for its similarity to that of Brittany and, as a result of the close physical and cultural ties between the two peninsulas, some older songs and carols share the same root as Breton tunes. From the late Middle Ages the fiddle (&quot;crowd&quot; in Cornish), bombarde (&quot;horn-pipe&quot;), bagpipes and harp all seem to have been used in music. The Cornish bagpipes died out, as elsewhere in southern England, in the 16th century, but have recently been re-created. From the mid-19th century accordions became progressively more popular as a folk instrument in the county, as in the rest of the West Country. There is long and varied history of Cornish dance from the medieval period, with records of strong traditions of morris dancing, mumming, guise dancing, and social dance. These seem to have been interrupted by the Reformation and Civil War and Commonwealth in the 16th and 17th centuries. However, there was revival from the late 18th century and seasonal and community festivals, mumming and guising all flourished. In the 19th century a strong tradition of nonconformity and temperance may also have affected dancing and music adversely and encouraged choral and brass band movements, while traditional tunes were used for carols. Some community events survived, such as the &#x27;Obby &#x27;Oss festival in Padstow and the Furry Dance in Helston. Folk songs include &#x27;Sweet Nightingale&#x27;, &#x27;Little Eyes&#x27;, and &#x27;Lamorna&#x27;. &#x27;Trelawny&#x27; is often sung at sporting events and is seen by many as an unofficial anthem. Few traditional Cornish lyrics survived the decline of the language, but in some cases lyrics of common English songs became attached to older Cornish tunes. Some folk tunes have Cornish lyrics written since the language revival of the 1920s. Modern Cornish musicians include the former Cornish folk singer Brenda Wootton and the Cornish-Breton family band Anao Atao. Recently bands like Sacred Turf, Skwardya and Krena, have begun performing British folk rock in the Cornish language. The Cornwall Folk Festival has been held annually for more than three decades.

====The rest of the West Country====
Outside Devon and Cornwall Celtic influence on music in the West Country is much less obvious, but folk music still retains many distinctive local characteristics. As in Cornwall there are very strong traditions of folk dance and mumming, the best known being the Hobby horse celebrations at Minehead in Somerset. The maritime heritage of Devon made sea shanties, hornpipes and naval or sea ballads important parts of regional folk music. From the 19th century accordions have been a popular and accepted part of the local folk sound. Folk songs from the West Country include &#x27;Widdecombe Fair&#x27;, &#x27;Spanish Ladies&#x27; and &#x27;The Seeds of Love.&#x27; The region was important in the first folk revival, as the Devon-born antiquarian Sabine Baring-Gould invested effort in collecting regional music, published as &quot;Songs and Ballads of the West&quot; (1889–91), the first collection published for the mass market. He later collaborated with Cecil Sharp who, with Charles Marson, produced a three volume &quot;Folk-Songs from Somerset&quot; (1904–09). Other collectors included Henry and Robert Hammond in Dorset, the Reverend Geoffrey Hill in Wiltshire, Percy Grainger in Gloucestershire and, perhaps the most famous, Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27; &#x27;Folk Songs from Somerset&#x27;, which provided themes for his &quot;English Folk Song Suite&quot;. In the second folk revival the most famous West country musicians were melodeon-player Bob Cann and writer, performer and broadcaster Cyril Tawney, &#x27;The Father of the West Country Folk Revival&#x27;. In the 1970s there were figures such as Tony Rose. The same period saw one of the most surprising hybrids in music history Scrumpy and Western with bands like the Wurzels and The Yetties, who took most of the elements of West Country folk music for comical folk-style songs with affectionate parodies of more mainstream musical genres, delivered in local West Country dialects. More seriously, the West Country and particularly Devon, have produced some of the most successful folk artists of recent years, including Show of Hands, Mark Bazeley and Jason Rice, Paul Downes, Jim Causley, Seth Lakeman and his brothers. The region has numerous folk clubs and annual festivals, including those at Portsmouth and the first modern English folk festival to be established at Sidmouth in Devon along with its associated &#x27;Late Night Extra&#x27; venue at Bulverton .

===Yorkshire===
Yorkshire has a rich heritage of folk music and folk dance including the Long Sword dance. Folk songs were collected there from the 19th century but, though it probably had more attention than other northern counties, its rich heritage of industrial folk song was relatively neglected. It was not until the second revival in the 1950s that Nigel and Mary Hudleston began to attempt to redress the balance, collecting Yorkshire songs between 1958 and 1978. Yorkshire folk song lacked the unique instrumental features of folk in areas like Northumbria and was chiefly distinguished by the use of dialect, particularly in the West Riding and exemplified by the song &#x27;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&#x27;, probably written in the later 19th century and using a Kent folk tune (almost certainly borrowed via a Methodist hymnal), but often seen as an unofficial Yorkshire anthem. Most Yorkshire folk songs were not unique and tended to be adapted to fit local geography and dialect, as was the case with probably the most commercially successful Yorkshire song, &#x27;Scarborough Fair&#x27;, recorded by Simon &amp; Garfunkel, which was a version of the Scottish ballad &#x27;The Elfin Knight&#x27;. The most famous folk performers from the county are the Watersons from Hull, who began recording Yorkshire versions of folk songs from 1965. Other Yorkshire folk musicians include Heather Wood (born 1945) of the Young Tradition, the short-lived folk rock group Mr Fox (1970–2), The Deighton Family, Julie Matthews, Kathryn Roberts, and the Mercury Prize nominated Kate Rusby. Even considering its position as the largest county in England, Yorkshire has a flourishing folk music culture, with over forty folk clubs and thirty annual folk music festivals. In 2007, the Yorkshire Garland Group was formed to make Yorkshire folk songs accessible online and in schools.

<text>Flying Nun Records is a New Zealand independent record label formed in Christchurch in 1981 by music store manager Roger Shepherd. Described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s great independent labels&quot;, Flying Nun is notable for bringing global attention to the Dunedin sound, a cultural and musical movement in early 1980s Dunedin.

==History==
The label formed in the wake of a flurry of new post-punk-inspired labels appearing in New Zealand in the early 1980s, in particular Propeller Records in Auckland. Shepherd had intended to record the original local music of Christchurch, but soon the label rose to national prominence by championing the emerging music of Dunedin.

&quot;Ambivalence&quot; by The Pin Group (the first band of Roy Montgomery) was the first release from Flying Nun, although &quot;Tally Ho&quot; by The Clean was the first release to draw public attention to the label, as it unexpectedly reached number nineteen in the New Zealand charts, bringing the label unanticipated profile and income. There followed the seminal &quot;Dunedin Double&quot;, a release which cemented the place of the southern city in the forefront of New Zealand independent music. Flying Nun moved into the full-length album market in 1982 with the &quot;Ego Gratification Album&quot; by Chris Knox and &quot;Beatin Hearts&quot; by Builders (recorded 1982, Auckland).

Many of New Zealand&#x27;s most prominent kiwi rock and alternative bands have signed to Flying Nun at some stage in their careers. In 2000 Australian youth radio network Triple J produced a list of the thirty &quot;Greatest New Zealand acts of all time&quot;, twenty of them by Flying Nun artists. The label has been home to various styles of music, including the much-debated Dunedin sound, &quot;high-end pop with a twist&quot;, lo-fi experimentation, strongly Velvet Underground-influenced pop, minimalism, industrial, and rock-electronic crossover.

In 1999 Matthew Bannister of The Sneaky Feelings wrote &quot;Positively George Street: A Personal History of the Sneaky Feelings and the Dunedin Sound&quot;, covering the New Zealand music industry of the 1980s, including Flying Nun. 

In 1990 Festival Records bought a fifty-percent stake in Flying Nun, and then in 2000 merged it with Mushroom Records, bringing Flying Nun into the Festival-Mushroom Records family of companies. Warner Music Group acquired Flying Nun as part of its purchase of FMR (Festival Mushroom Records) in 2006. A consortium that included Shepherd bought back the label from Warner on 21 December 2009, for &quot;more than what I sold it for&quot;. New Zealand musician Neil Finn, his wife Sharon, and another business partner together own a quarter-share in the repatriated record label.

In 2013, American label Captured Tracks announced plans for selected reissues of Flying Nun&#x27;s back catalogue.

The label&#x27;s history and daily workings of Flying Nun were extensively covered in Roger Shepherd&#x27;s 2016 autobiography, &quot;In Love With These Times&quot;.

In the 2018 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours Shepherd was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit (ONZM) for services to the music industry.

In the 2020s, Flying Nun ventured into retail with both an online store and physical locations selling records from their own artists alongside other albums on vinyl and CD. In 2022 they opened a record shop on Cuba Street in Wellington, and in 2023 they opened another retail store on Auckland&#x27;s Karangahape Road.

In 2022, Canadian author Matthew Goody published &quot;Needles and Plastic: Flying Nun Records, 1981–1988&quot;, a comprehensive book charting the label&#x27;s history, associated figures, and every release or band put out during its first seven years. The book took 10 years to write, and includes live photos, posters, artwork and other documentation.

<text>The alpine swift (Tachymarptis melba, formerly &quot;Apus melba&quot;) is a species of swift found in Africa, southern Europe, and Asia. They breed in mountains from southern Europe to the Himalayas. Like common swifts, they are migratory; the southern European population winters further south in southern Africa. They have very short legs which are used for clinging to vertical surfaces. Like most swifts, they never settle voluntarily on the ground, spending most of their lives in the air living on the insects they catch in their beaks.

== Taxonomy==
The alpine swift was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the swifts in the genus &quot;Hirundo&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Hirundo melba&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Gibraltar. Linnaeus based his account on &quot;The greatest martin or swift&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1743 by the English naturalist George Edwards in his book &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. Edwards&#x27;s specimen had been shot on the rock of Gibraltar. The alpine swift is now placed together with the mottled swift in the genus &quot;Tachymarptis&quot; that was introduced in 1922 by the South African zoologist Austin Roberts. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek ταχυς/&quot;takhus&quot; meaning &quot;fast&quot;, and μαρπτις/&quot;marptis&quot; meaning &quot;seizer&quot;. The etymology of the specific epithet &quot;melba&quot; is uncertain, but it may be a short form for &quot;melanoalba&quot; or &quot;melalba&quot;, from Ancient Greek μελας /&quot;melas&quot;, μελανος/&quot;melanos&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; and Latin &quot;albus&quot; meaning &quot;white&quot;.

Ten subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;T. m. melba&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – south Europe through Turkey to northwest Iran
* &quot;T. m. tuneti&quot; (Tschusi, 1904) – Morocco through the Middle East and east to west Pakistan
* &quot;T. m. archeri&quot; (Hartert, EJO, 1928) – north Somalia, southwest Arabia to Jordan and Israel
* &quot;T. m. maximus&quot; (Ogilvie-Grant, 1907) – Rwenzori Mountains (northeast DR Congo and Uganda)
* &quot;T. m. africanus&quot; (Temminck, 1815) – Ethiopia to South Africa and southwest Angola
* &quot;T. m. marjoriae&quot; (Bradfield, 1935) – central north Namibia and northwest South Africa
* &quot;T. m. willsi&quot; (Hartert, EJO, 1896) – Madagascar
* &quot;T. m. nubifugus&quot; (Koelz, 1954) – Himalayas
* &quot;T. m. dorabtatai&quot; (Abdulali, 1965) – west India
* &quot;T. m. bakeri&quot; (Hartert, EJO, 1928) – Sri Lanka

== Description and biology ==
This is a large swift measuring 20–22 cm in length with a wingspan of 54–60 cm with broad wings and tail with a shallow fork, superficially similar to a large barn swallow or house martin although unrelated to these two species, since swifts are in the order Apodiformes. The resemblance could be due to convergent evolution, reflecting similar lifestyles. Upper parts are olive-brown with sharp and long wings with wing-tips appearing blacker; underparts with white throat (often not easily visible) and highly visible and distinctive oval white belly patch encircled by olive-brown breastband, flanks and undertail-coverts. Races &quot;tuneti&quot; and &quot;marjoriae&quot; paler, with grey-brown plumage; &quot;archeri&quot; averages paler than &quot;tuneti&quot;, with shorter wings; &quot;maximus&quot; is the largest race, with very dark, blackish plumage; &quot;africanus&quot; and &quot;nubifugus&quot; smaller than nominate, with blacker plumage, smaller throat patch and blacker shaft-streaks on white areas; &quot;willsi&quot; and &quot;bakeri&quot; both smaller, with darker plumage and broader and narrower breast bands, respectively; &quot;dorabtatai&quot; has broader breast band and shorter wings than &quot;nubifugus&quot; and is separated from &quot;bakeri&quot; by its paler plumage and broader breast band.

Alpine swifts breed in mountains from southern Europe to the Himalaya. Like common swifts, they are strongly migratory, and winter much further south in southern Africa. They wander widely on migration, and are regularly seen in much of southern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The species seems to have been much more widespread during the last ice age, with a large colony breeding, for example in the Late Pleistocene Cave No 16, Bulgaria, around 18,000–40,000 years ago. The same situation has been found for Komarowa Cave near Częstochowa, Poland during a period about 20,000–40,000 years ago.

These apodiformes build their nests in colonies in a suitable cliff hole or cave, laying two or three eggs. Swifts will return to the same sites year after year, rebuilding their nests when necessary, and pairing for life. Young swifts in the nest can drop their body temperature and become torpid if bad weather prevents their parents from catching insects nearby. They have adapted well to urban conditions, frequently nesting in old buildings in towns around the Mediterranean, where large, low-flying flocks are a familiar feature there in summer. Alpine swifts have a short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang but may (as in the image) be held stretched straight out. Their flight is slower and more powerful than that of their smaller relatives, with a call that is a drawn-out twittering (listen at right).

Alpine swifts are readily distinguished from the common swifts by their larger size and their white belly and throat. They are around twice as big as most other swifts in their range, about in length, with a wingspan of and a weight of around . By comparison, the common swift has a wingspan of around . They&#x27;re largely dark brown in colour with a dark neck band that separates the white throat from the white belly.
Juveniles are similar to adults, but their feathers are pale edged.


== Distribution and habitat ==
It is a polytypic species found all year-round in eastern and southern Africa, Madagascar, western peninsular India and Sri Lanka, with larger non-breeding distributions in western, eastern and southern Africa, parts of the western edge of the Arabian peninsula, and breeding across southern Europe in the west across Turkey, northwards through the Caucasus and along the east coast of the Black Sea to the Crimean peninsula and Central Asia up to Turkestan and to the south along Iran and Afghanistan up to Balochistan in Western Pakistan and further east along the Himalayas. There are also scattered populations in northwestern Africa with an isolated population in Northern Libya. The distribution of the 10 sub-species are: (1) &quot;A. m. melba&quot; (76–120g) described originally by Linnaeus (1758) with type-locality Gibraltar distributed across southern Europe (east from Iberian Peninsula) and northern Morocco and east through Asia Minor to northwest Iran and wintering in west, central and east Africa, (2) &quot;A. m. tuneti&quot; (95–110g) described by von Tschusi in 1904 with type-locality in Tunisia and distributed across central and eastern Morocco eastwards to Libya and through Middle East and Iran (except northwest where &quot;A. m. melba&quot;) to southeast Kazakhstan and up to western Pakistan, and wintering in west and east Africa, (3) &quot;A. m. archeri&quot; described by Hartert (1928) with type-locality Hargeisa, in Somaliland distributed from the Dead Sea depression at the borders of Israel and Jordan, south to southwest Arabia and Somalia, (4) &quot;A. m. africanus&quot; (67–87g) described by Temminck (1815) with type-locality in South Africa distributed across east and southern Africa and southwest Angola with some populations of this sub-species wintering in east Africa, (5) &quot;A. m. maximus&quot; (128g) described by Ogilvie-Grant (1907) with type-locality in the eastern slopes of the Rwenzori mountains at distributed across Uganda and DR Congo, (6) &quot;A. m. marjoriae&quot; described by R D Bradfield (1935) from Quickborn, Damaraland distributed in Namibia and adjacent western South Africa in the northwestern parts of Northern Cape, (7) &quot;A. m. willsi&quot; described by Ernst Hartnert (1896) from Madagascar and endemic to the island, (8) &quot;A. m. nubifugus&quot; described by Koelz (1854) distributed across the Himalayas and wintering in central India, (9) &quot;A. m. dorabtatai&quot; described by Abdulali (1965) distributed in western peninsular India, (10) &quot;A. m. bakeri&quot; described by Hartert (1928) from Sri Lanka distributed only on that island-nation. In the western palearctic, temperate and mediterranean zones, it is typically in the mountains but occasionally in lowlands, while in remainder of sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, it occurs in a larger variety of habitats ranging from sub-desert steppe to mountains. It typically breeds below but may sometimes go up to . In the tropical parts of it range in Kenya, it has been recorded breeding above 4000 m and in the Himalayas, it has been observed foraging at . Seen entering probable nesting sites at on Madagascar.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

It has a powerful and rapid flight with deep slow wing beats. They are known to engage in twilight ascent, which is characterised by increased flight activity and gaining altitude and longer-distance horizontal flights at dawn and dusk, possibly part of social interactions between individuals. Alpine swifts spend most of their lives in the air, living on the insects they catch in their beaks. They drink on the wing, but roost on vertical cliffs or walls. A study published in 2013 showed Alpine swifts can spend over six months flying without having to land. All vital physiological processes, including sleep, can be performed while in air. In 2011, Felix Liechti and his colleagues at the Swiss Ornithological Institute attached electronic tags that log movement to six alpine swifts and it was discovered that the birds could stay aloft in the air for more than 200 days straight.

=== Breeding ===
=== Food and feeding ===
The alpine swift&#x27;s diet consists mainly of arthropods, principally insects but also spiders. Insects across 10 orders and 79 families were documented in the diets of individuals from Africa and Europe, with the homoptera, diptera and hymenoptera being the most often consumed.

<text>Korabl-Sputnik 1 ( meaning &quot;Vessel Satellite 1&quot;), also known as Sputnik 4 in the West, was the first test flight of the Soviet Vostok programme, and the first Vostok spacecraft. It was launched on May 15, 1960. Though Korabl-Sputnik 1 was uncrewed, it was a precursor to the first human spaceflight, Vostok 1. Its mass was , of which was instrumentation. 

The spacecraft, the first of a series of spacecraft used to investigate the means for crewed space flight, contained scientific instruments, a television system, and a self-sustaining biological cabin with a dummy of a man. It was designed to study the operation of the life support system and the stresses of flight. The spacecraft radioed both extensive telemetry and prerecorded voice communications. After four days of flight, the retro rocket was fired and the descent module was separated from its equipment module, but because the spacecraft was not in the correct flight attitude when its retro fired, the descent module did not reenter the atmosphere as planned. 
The descent module re-entered the atmosphere on September 5, 1962, while the equipment module re-entered on October 15, 1965. A 20-pound piece of the descent module landed in Manitowoc, Wisconsin in the northern United States.

Giovanni Battista Judica Cordiglia, who set up his own amateur listening station at Torre Bert near Turin, is reported to have claimed that radio signals were received on November 28, 1960, which could have originated from this spacecraft; the spacecraft is known to have radioed prerecorded voice communications. It has led some to believe a conspiracy theory that the spacecraft may have been crewed by one of the Lost Cosmonauts.

<text>The King of Malaysia, officially Yang di-Pertuan Agong ( Jawi: ), is the constitutional monarch and head of state of Malaysia. The office was established in 1957, when the Federation of Malaya (now Malaysia) gained independence from the United Kingdom. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected by the Conference of Rulers, comprising the nine rulers of the Malay states, with the office &quot;de facto&quot; rotated between them, making Malaysia one of the world&#x27;s few elective monarchies.

The 17th and current Yang di-Pertuan Agong is Ibrahim Iskandar of Johor. He was elected on 26 October 2023, at a special meeting of the Conference of Rulers; he took the oath of office and was sworn in at the Istana Negara on 31 January 2024. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong&#x27;s queen consort is known as the &quot;Raja Permaisuri Agong&quot;, currently Raja Zarith Sofiah. The royal couple are styled in English as &quot;His Majesty&quot; and &quot;Her Majesty&quot;.

==Constitutional role==
The &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot;&#x27;s role is that of a constitutional monarch. The Federal Constitution of Malaysia and Acts of Parliament made in accordance with it define the extent of his powers as the head of state. These are divided into two categories: powers exercised on the advice of the Cabinet or of a minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet, the Conference of Rulers, or some other officer or institution, and discretionary powers.

The Constitution vests the executive power of the federal government in the monarch. However, with few exceptions, the king is bound to exercise this power on the advice of the Cabinet or of a minister acting under the Cabinet&#x27;s general authority. In practice, most of the actual day-to-day work of governing is performed by the Federal Cabinet.

The discretionary powers of the king as stated by the Constitution and laws pertain chiefly to appointing the prime minister, withholding consent to dissolve Parliament, and calling meetings with the Conference of Rulers &quot;concerned solely with the privileges, position, honours and dignities of Their Royal Highnesses&quot;. Under the Westminster system, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is expected to appoint a prime minister who will command the confidence of a majority of the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot;, the elected lower house of Parliament. Should the prime minister be or become unacceptable, he may be forced out by a vote of no confidence, which would require the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to appoint someone else as prime minister or dissolve Parliament for an election. Conventionally, the prime minister is the head of the party with a majority in Parliament. This was the &quot;Barisan Nasional&quot; coalition from independence in 1957 until 2018, when the &quot;Pakatan Harapan&quot; coalition took office. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong renews the appointment of a prime minister after every general election until the minister decides to step down.

The Yang di-Pertuan Agong has discretionary powers to choose who he wants as the prime minister if no party has won a majority vote and is not bound by the decision of the outgoing prime minister (Article 40). It, however, does not afford him the right and authority to dismiss the prime minister. He also can dismiss or withhold consent to a request for the dissolution of parliament (Article 40). He may discontinue or dissolve parliament (Article 55) but he can only dissolve parliament at the request of the prime minister (Article 43). He can reject any new laws or amendments to existing laws but if he still withholds permission, it will automatically become law after 30 days from the initial submission to him (Article 66).

===Appointments===
The king appoints numerous high-ranking office holders in the federation under the terms of the Constitution and various legislative acts passed by Parliament. The constitution established procedures for such appointments.

====The Cabinet of Ministers====
* Prime Minister, to preside over the Cabinet, appointed at his discretion from among the elected members of the House of Representatives who in his judgment is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the members of that house – usually the party or coalition leader.
* Deputy Prime Minister, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, while acting on the advice of the Prime Minister.
* Chief Secretary to the Government as the Secretary of the Cabinet, while acting on the advice of the Prime Minister.

====Commissions and committees====
* The Election Commission, on the advice of the Conference of Rulers.
* The Judicial and Legal Service Commission, after consultation with the Chief Justice
* The Malaysian Public Service Commission at his discretion, after considering the advice of the Prime Minister and after consultation with the Conference of Rulers.

====Judges====
* The Chief Justice of Malaysia, on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Conference of Rulers.
* The Chief Judge of Malaya, on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Conference of Rulers.
* The Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak, on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Conference of Rulers.

====Senators====
The king appoints 44 at-large senators to the &quot;Dewan Negara&quot;, the upper house of Parliament.

====State governors====
The king appoints the (Governors), of the states of Penang, Malacca, Sabah and Sarawak, at his discretion, after considering the advice of the state&#x27;s Chief Minister/Premier, for four year terms. The governor&#x27;s term of office can be renewed also at his disrection. 

He also appoints the Mayor and City Council of Kuala Lumpur.

===Head of Islam===
In addition, the king is the Head of Islam in the four states ruled by appointed governors, in the three Federal Territories (The cities of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya and Labuan Island), as well as in his own home state. In this role, he is advised by the State Islamic Affairs Council in each of the States.

The king appoints the chairman and members of each state council. He also appoints the State Mufti (head) in each of these states. There is a single Islamic Affairs Council with jurisdiction for the three Federal Territories. Its members and chairman are appointed by the king, who also appoints the mufti of the Federal Territories.

===Commander-in-Chief===

In accordance with Article 41 of the Constitution, the king is Commander-in-Chief of the Malaysian Armed Forces. As such, he is the highest-ranking officer in the military chain of command, holding five star rank in its branches.

As the Supreme Commander of the Malaysian Armed Forces, he appoints the Chief of Defence Forces, on the advice of the Armed Forces Council. He also appoints the service heads of each of the three branches of the armed forces.

== History ==
On 31 August 1957, having rejected the suggested title of &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Besar&quot; in favour of &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot;, the Conference of Rulers elected the first occupant of the federal throne. By seniority, the 84-year-old major general Ibrahim of Johor, Sultan of Johor since 1895, was first in line, but he declined the office due to old age. The next in line, Abu Bakar of Pahang, Sultan of Pahang since 1932, was rejected five times by his fellow electors and did not secure the necessary votes, in part because his various marriages to celebrities and cabaret dancers were seen as unbecoming of royalty – especially with the revelation (according to an oral interview with Tunku Abdul Rahman) of a surprise wedding to a ronggeng dancer and their honeymoon to Hong Kong. Abdul Rahman of Negeri Sembilan, who had been elected to his state throne (Yamtuan Besar) in 1933, was elected king by eight votes to one.

The first Conference of Rulers after the formation of Malaysia comprised:
== Election ==
The holder of the office and title of King of Malaysia is formally elected to a five-year term by and from the nine rulers of the Malay states (the nine states of Malaysia that have hereditary royal rulers), who form the Conference of Rulers. After a ruler has served his term as king, he may not stand for election until all rulers of the other states have also stood for election to the office and have served their office.

In the event of a vacancy of the office (by death, abdication, or deposition by a majority vote of the rulers), the Conference of Rulers elects a new office holder as king as if the previous term had expired. The new king is elected for a full five-year term by the Conference. After his term expires, it holds a new election, in which the incumbent would not be re-elected to the office.

The position &quot;de facto&quot; rotates among the nine state rulers. The selection of the candidate for the kingship initially followed an order based on the seniority (calculated by length of reign) of each ruler in 1957, at the Federation of Malaya&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom. The Conference of Rulers, which has the power to disqualify a candidate, has sometimes varied the original seniority order, as noted above. Since then, the states have followed a &quot;de facto&quot; established rotation order. Minors are automatically disqualified from nomination and holding the office.

The Conference of Rulers has met regularly since 1985. The four governors (; the heads of states without hereditary rulers) also attend the Conference, but only rulers are allowed to vote and stand for election for the office of king.

===Qualifications===
* Only a ruler may be elected king.
* Only the rulers may vote for the nominated ruler.

The Constitution provides that a ruler is not eligible for election as king if:

* The ruler is a minor.
* The ruler has notified the Keeper of the Rulers&#x27; Seal that he does not wish to be elected to the office.
* The Conference of Rulers by a secret ballot resolves that the ruler is unsuitable by reason of infirmity of mind or body, or for any other cause, to exercise the functions of the office of king. The resolution requires that at least, five royal members of the Conference to vote in favour of it.

===Election proceedings===

The election is carried out by a secret ballot. The ballot papers used are not numbered, but marked with the same pen and ink, and are inserted into a ballot box. Only the royal rulers of the states participate in the election.

A ruler may appoint another ruler as his proxy to vote on his behalf if he is unable to attend the Election Meeting.

During the election process, the Keeper of the Rulers&#x27; Seal distributes the ballot with only one candidate. Each ruler is requested to indicate whether the candidate is suitable or not to be elected King.

The most junior ruler, who is not listed as nominee for the office of king, or the outgoing King is appointed to count the ballot papers together with the Keeper of the Rulers&#x27; Seal.

The nominee must have obtained five votes before the ruler presiding over the Election Meeting informs him of his election to the office of King and asks him to accept the title. If the successful nominee declines the offer or the nominated ruler fails to secure the required majority votes for the office, the voting process is repeated with the nomination of the second most senior ruler based on the list of Seniority of States. Rulers are named and stand for election in turn.

The process is completed only after a ruler has accepted the offer of the office of King by the presiding ruler. The Conference declares the elected ruler to be the new king to hold office for a term of five years. The ballot papers are destroyed in the presence of the rulers as soon as the result of the election is announced.

On taking office as king months after election, he appoints a regent for the duration of his five-year term for the state which he rules. Usually, but not always, the prince regent is a close relative. The regent acts as head of state in that state for every purpose except for the role of head of Islam, which is retained by the king.

===Order of seniority of states===

Since the first cycle of nine kings (1957–1994), the order among the eligible state rulers has followed the order established by that cycle, namely:
# the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan
# the Sultan of Selangor
# the Raja of Perlis
# the Sultan of Terengganu
# the Sultan of Kedah
# the Sultan of Kelantan
# the Sultan of Pahang
# the Sultan of Johor
# the Sultan of Perak

With Brunei&#x27;s decision not to participate in the formation of Malaysia in 1963, only the rulers of the nine royal states of Peninsular Malaysia have been made eligible for election for the throne. Had it been admitted as a royal state the Sultan of Brunei would have been granted the right to stand for election as king by the Conference of Rulers.

This cycle was originally established based on seniority. However, the current rulers are named (and stand as a candidate) according to the cycle, irrespective of whether they are currently the most senior. Since independence from British colonial rule, this has been the order of elected kings. However, the order is not a precedent and the election to the position and office of the king is at the pleasure of the Conference of Rulers. As an elective monarchy, there is no line of succession to the throne of Malaysia.

Four of the states of Malaysia do not have hereditary rulers. These are Malacca, Penang, Sarawak and Sabah. Sarawak previously had three hereditary rulers (the White Rajahs) until it became a Crown colony of the British Empire in 1946. These four states, along with Malaysia&#x27;s three Federal Territories, do not supply the king. 

==Immunity==
In 1993, amendments to the Malaysian constitution removed the legal immunity of the king and the state rulers in their personal capacity, due to public outrage over their behaviour. A Special Court (&quot;Mahkamah Khas Raja-raja&quot;) is established where civil and criminal proceedings can be made against a ruler with the approval of the Attorney General. The right to sue a ruler is limited to Malaysian citizens following a precedent. The Special Court also have jurisdiction where a ruler initiates legal actions against any party.

When a ruler is charged with an offence in the Special Court, he is required to stop exercising the functions of a ruler. In the event of a ruler being sentenced to imprisonment for more than one day, he will be forced to abdicate from his duties as a ruler unless a free pardon is granted.

The king or any ruler cannot pardon himself or his immediate family. In such case, they may request clemency from the Conference of Rulers.

The king cannot be sued in court for his actions while carrying out his official duties. Any claims can be made against the federal government.

==Residences==
The official residence of the King is the &quot;Istana Negara&quot; (the National Palace) located in Jalan Tuanku Abdul Halim in the federal capital Kuala Lumpur. It was completed in 2011. It replaced the old Istana Negara in Jalan Istana which had been turned into the Royal Museum in 2013. Other residences include the royal retreat, &quot;Istana Melawati&quot; in the federal administrative capital Putrajaya. The two palaces alternate as a venue of meetings of the Conference of Rulers.

==Titles and style==
The King&#x27;s official full style and title in Malay is .

* literally means &#x27;Under the dust of the Almighty&#x27;, referring to how the regal power of the King is dust compared to the power of God and the ruler is always subservient to God.
* refers to &quot;Seri&quot; as in a person. means footwear or shoes, and the term &quot;,&quot; is a third-person pronoun in Malay for royalty and prophets. These terms imply a lower status of the King compared to the prophets.
* in literal English is &#x27;He who is made Supreme Lord&#x27;. It is an archaic term for a presiding head which is or literally means &#x27;One who is made lord&#x27;. &quot;Agong&quot; (or in standard Malay) means &#x27;supreme&#x27;. The term is not translated, as in the Constitution of Malaysia.

Common English terms used in the media and by the general public include &quot;Paramount Ruler&quot;, &quot;Head of State&quot;, &quot;Head of the Federation&quot; and &quot;Head of State of the Federation&quot;. The very common term &quot;King&quot; has also been conveniently used by the media and the public, although incorrectly as it is not an official or legal title of the federal ruler.

In Malaysian passports before 2010, the title &quot;The Supreme Head of Malaysia&quot; was used in the English version of the passport note. Since the issuance of ICAO-compliant e-passports in 2010, the untranslated title &quot;His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia&quot; has been used.

In formal English correspondence, for many years the King was referred to as &quot;His Majesty The Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot;. In January 2024, this was changed to &quot;His Majesty The King of Malaysia&quot;.

Formal address to the King is taken seriously in Malaysia. There are two ways of addressing the King: 

* Malay: &quot;Tuanku&quot; (literally &#x27;My Lord&#x27;)
* English: Your Majesty

==Royal Standards==
The Royal Standard of the king is royal yellow with the Coat of arms of Malaysia in the centre, surrounded by a rice paddy wreath coloured gold – both are traditional royal colours in the peninsula. The same goes for the Royal Standards of the Queen and the Deputy King, but the designs are different. The queen&#x27;s standard is green in colour, with the coat of arms at the centre surrounded by the paddy wreath. The deputy king&#x27;s standard is bicolored, yellow at the top and light blue at the bottom, with the coat of arms at the centre (without the paddy) and below that is the office bearer&#x27;s title in a gold scroll.

==Deputy King==

The Deputy King of Malaysia (Malay: &quot;Timbalan Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot;) is elected by the same process immediately after the king has been elected by the Conference of Rules. The office is usually (but not always) held by the ruler next in line to rule after the current king. The deputy king exercises the functions of the head of state during the king&#x27;s absence, or inability to exercise the functions of his office due to illness or infirmity (similar to a regent or viceroy/vizier in other countries).

The deputy king does not automatically succeed as King of Malaysia when a vacancy occurs in that office. The deputy king acts as head of state in the interregnum period before the election of the new king and deputy king by the Conference of Rulers as stated by the Constitution and legislative acts of Parliament.

The current holder of the office of Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong is Sultan Nazrin Shah of Perak since 13 December 2016, the first to hold it for three straight terms of office.

==Official birthday==
The first Saturday of June, until 2015, was mandated by law as the official birthday of the king. It is marked with various activities all over the nation and the celebrations in Kuala Lumpur are the highlights of the national festivities, with the celebrations of it from 2013 onwards lasting a whole week between two weekends.

After the installation of Sultan Muhammad V as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in 2017, the date for the official birthday was amended twice, first to the last Saturday of July, and then to September 9. This amendment was originally planned to take effect under the reign of Sultan Muhammad V until 2021, before his announcement of abdication. In March 2020, it was announced that Yang di-Pertuan Agong&#x27;s birthday would be changed from the customary first Saturday of June (6 June) to the following Monday (8 June). From 2021, subsequent iterations of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong&#x27;s birthday throughout Sultan Abdullah&#x27;s reign will fall on the first Monday of June instead.

The King&#x27;s Official Birthday is recognized by law as one of the official federal holidays of Malaysia. While it warrants government offices, including schools to be closed and banks and other offices would follow suit, most of it falls on Saturday which is the nation&#x27;s common weekend day so no additional leave day will be given and premises would already be closed for the weekend. This was before the amendments made it a weekday holiday.

===The Yang di-Pertuan Agong&#x27;s Birthday Honours List Ceremony and Birthday High Tea===
The Istana Negara in Kuala Lumpur serves as the venue for the annual Yang di-Pertuan Agong&#x27;s Birthday Honours List and Address to the Nation ceremony attended by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and the Raja Permaisuri Agong, members of the Federal Government and Parliament, the state diplomatic corps, honoured guests and the Honours List members for the year, in the order of precedence of state medals. The event honours the year&#x27;s national achievers and heroes with the awarding of state orders, medals and decorations and their accompanying titles. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong addresses the whole nation via radio and television on this day from the Throne Room of the palace complex. It is followed later by the traditional holiday high tea gathering at the palace grounds in the afternoon.

====Trooping the Colour====
Trooping the Colour in Malaysia, although inherited from the British, has transformed into a grander and more Malaysian celebration on the first Saturday of June annually live on Kuala Lumpur&#x27;s Independence Square, which is both open to invited guests and the general public. As the Supreme Commander of the Malaysian Armed Forces, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong takes the salute on this day together with the commanders of the three services of the Malaysian Armed Forces, the Joint Forces Command, Malaysia and the members of the Malaysian Armed Forces Council, of which he is the chairman, plus military personnel and veterans in attendance. He wears the No.1 dress uniform on that day, and as each of the 8 state monarchs are Colonel-in-Chief of selected Malaysian Army regiments as well as of the Royal Malaysian Air Force and the Sultan of Selangor serves as Commodore-in-Chief of the Royal Malaysian Navy, he wears that regiment&#x27;s coloured sash as part of his ceremonial uniform (for the Army), or the RMAF blue or RMN white No. 1 dress uniform. The 2013 edition was held on the second Saturday of June for the first time, while the 2016 parade was held on the fourth Friday of July (22 July) for the first time in Putrajaya, the national seat of government.

RTM broadcasts the ceremony live, starting at 8:50am.

==Yang di-Pertuan Agong Scholarship==

In November 2006, the 10th Yang di-Pertuan Agong awarded, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Scholarship for the first time, to ten outstanding students to pursue postgraduate studies at high-ranking world universities. The award of scholarships was held at the Istana Negara in conjunction with the Independence Day celebrations and the Conference of Rulers.

<text>Terengganu (; , formerly spelled Trengganu or Tringganu) is a sultanate and federal state of Malaysia. The state is also known by its Arabic honorific, &quot;Dāru l-Īmān&quot; (&quot;Abode of Faith&quot;). The coastal city of Kuala Terengganu, at the mouth of the Terengganu River, is both the state and royal capital as well as the most populous city in Terengganu. Other major cities and towns include Jerteh, Kuala Dungun, Chukai, Kuala Berang, Marang, and Permaisuri. At 13,035 square kilometres in size and a population of over 1.2 million people in 2023, Terengganu is Malaysia&#x27;s 7th largest state and 10th most populated. Terengganu, along with Kelantan, Perlis, and the Federal Territory of Putrajaya, is one of the most homogeneous states/territories in the country of which 95% of the population are ethnic Malay-Muslims with its own distinct language/dialect, culture, history, and tradition.

Located on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, Terengganu borders the state of Kelantan to the north and Pahang to the west and south, and the South China Sea to the east. Terengganu is geographically divided into sparsely populated and mountainous inland (known as the Terengganu Highlands of which the highest point is Mount Lawit at 1,519 metres) that span from the border with Kelantan to Kemaman district and largely flat coastal plains of which most of the state&#x27;s 1.1 million people are concentrated. The state is known for having the longest coastline in Peninsular Malaysia and achieved the Malaysian Book of Records for having the cleanest beach in the country. Many of the most popular islands in Malaysia are located in the state such as Perhentian, Kapas, and Redang islands, as well as Bidong Island, once a refuge to tens of thousands of Vietnamese refugees in the 1970s.

==Etymology==
There are several theories on the origin of the name &quot;Terengganu&quot;. One theory attributes the name&#x27;s origin to &quot;terang ganu&quot;, Malay for &#x27;bright rainbow&#x27;. Another story, said to have been originally narrated by the ninth Sultan of Terengganu, Baginda Omar, tells of a party of hunters from Pahang roving and hunting in the area of what is now southern Terengganu. One of the hunters spotted a large animal fang lying on the ground. A fellow party member asked what animal the fang belonged too. The hunter, not knowing which animal, simply answered &quot;taring anu&quot; (Malay: &#x27;fang of something&#x27;). The party later returned to Pahang with a rich hoard of game, fur and sandalwood, which impressed their neighbours. They asked the hunters where they sourced their riches, to which they replied, from the land of &quot;taring anu&quot;, which later evolved into Terengganu. Terengganu was called Trangkanu () by the Siamese when it was under their influence. Terengganuans usually pronounce Terengganu as Tranung or Ganu with the G often being emphasized.

===Chinese naming===
The traditional Chinese name for Terengganu has been &quot;丁加奴&quot; (Pinyin: dīngjiānú), which is a direct transcription of the Malay name. However, in recent years, the Chinese community in Terengganu has raised objections to the name, citing that the characters used loosely translate to &quot;giving birth to a child who will become a slave&quot; (Chinese: 添丁加做奴). Therefore, they successfully petitioned the regulatory commission for Chinese language in Malaysia to change the Chinese name for the state to &quot;登嘉楼&quot; (Pinyin: dēngjiālóu), which can be loosely translated to &quot;aspiring/stepping up to a higher level&quot;, in September 2004. The new name was in unofficial use by the state&#x27;s Chinese community for at least 30 years before its official adoption.

Certain segments of the Chinese community opposed the name change, citing the fact that the new name contains too many character strokes, making it much more difficult to write. They have proposed to revert the name to the version used before 2004, but with the word &quot;奴&quot; (slave, which was mainly the cause of the controversy) to the similar sounding, but more positive &quot;努&quot; (perseverance).

==History==

===Prehistory===
Human activity may have been present in Terengganu as early as 16,000 years ago during the Paleolithic era as evidenced by the discovery of a skeleton in Gua Bewah, Hulu Terengganu in 2009. The skeleton, called &quot;Bewah Man&quot; (Malay: &quot;Orang Bewah&quot;), has been analyzed as 5,000 years older than skeletons found in Perak, making it the oldest known modern human skeleton in the country.

===Hindu-Buddhist Era===
Terengganu&#x27;s location by the South China Sea ensured that it was on trade routes since ancient times. Based on Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd atlus &quot;Geography&quot; referred to what is now Terengannu as either &quot;Perimula,&quot; &quot;Kole Polis&quot; or &quot;Tharra&quot;. The earliest written reports on the area that mentioned the name &quot;Terengganu&quot; were by Chinese merchants and seafarers in the early 6th century A.D. During the early Hindu–Buddhist period, Terengganu was known as &quot;Tan-Tan&quot; which is based in what is now Kuala Telemong. It was a small ancient polity that came under the influence of Langkasuka, a powerful kingdom based either in Kedah or Patani in the 1st century AD. In the 7th century, the dynasty of Langkasuka that once ruled over Terengganu was replaced by a new kingdom called Srivijaya. Under Srivijaya, Terengganu traded extensively with other kingdoms in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra, Champa, the Khmer Empire, the Majapahit Empire and especially the Chinese.

===Medieval and early modern period=== 
Terengganu was the first Malay state to receive Islam, as attested to by the Terengganu Inscription Stone with Arabic inscriptions found in Kuala Berang, the capital of the district of Hulu Terengganu. The inscribed date which is incomplete due to damage can be read as various dates from 702 to 789 AH (1303 to 1387 CE). Terengganu became a vassal state of Malacca, but retained considerable autonomy with the emergence of the Johor Sultanate. In 1710, the Thai kingdom of Ayutthaya invaded Terengganu, but as the Johoreans prepared to repel the attack on their dependency, the Ayutthaya forces diverted to fight a Vietnamese attack in Cambodia. At the end of the Malacca-Johor dynasty in 1699, Terengganu had emerged as a key supplier of pepper for Chinese merchants and &quot;perahu&quot; of the eastern archipelago, although the polity only had 500 warriors and no fleets. After being defeated in Johor&#x27;s civil war in 1718, Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah IV of Johor fled to Terengganu. He set up a rival court and handed out important titles to the local chiefs, drawing Terengganu into the forefront of Malay politics.
Terengganu emerged as an independent sultanate in 1724. The first sultan was Tun Zainal Abidin, the younger brother of a former sultan of Johor, and Johor strongly influenced Terengganu&#x27;s politics through the 18th century. However, in the book &quot;Tuhfat al-Nafis&quot;, the author, Raja Ali Haji, mentions that in 1725, Tun Zainal Abidin was installed as the Sultan of Terengganu by Daeng Menampuk – also known as Raja Tua – under the rule of Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah of Johor. Meanwhile, oral tradition records that Zainal Abidin was installed as sultan by the Patani Queen.

Scottish sailor Alexander Hamilton was known to have made several recorded visits to Terengganu in 1719 and 1720.

In 1741, Sultan Sulaiman installed Sultan Mansur as ruler of Terengganu, his rule from 1741 to 1793 saw him creating a strong united Malay front against the rising power of the Bugis. He expanded his power on a weakened and divided Kelantan in 1764, culminating in his son&#x27;s marriage to the daughter of the ruler of Kelantan. European accounts of the time praised the well-ordered administration of his rule, while at the same time he was highly respected by his subjects.

In the 19th century, Terengganu became a vassal state of the Thai Rattanakosin Kingdom, and sent tribute every year called &quot;bunga mas&quot;. This occurred under the reign of Sultan Omar Riayat Shah, who was remembered as a devout ruler who promoted trade and stable government. Terengganu prospered, and was largely left alone by the authorities in Bangkok unlike in neighbouring Patani and Kelantan. The period also witnessed the existence of a Terengganuan vassal of Besut Darul Iman.

===Modern era===
The terms of the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 saw power over Terengganu transferred from Siam to Britain. A British advisor was appointed to the sultan in 1919, and Terengganu become one of the Unfederated Malay States. The move was highly unpopular spurring several uprisings in 1922 and 1925 before climaxing in May 1928 with the Peasant&#x27;s Rebellion (&quot;Pemberontakan Tani&quot;) led by Abdul Rahman Limbong which was quashed by British military force.

During World War II, Japan occupied Terengganu and transferred sovereignty over the state back to Siam – which had been renamed Thailand in 1939 – along with Kelantan, Kedah, and Perlis. After the defeat of Japan, British control over these Malay states was reestablished. Terengganu became a member of the Federation of Malaya in 1948, then a state of a sovereign Malaya in 1957, which became Malaysia in 1963.

Following decades of rule by the Barisan Nasional coalition, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) came to power in 1999, making Terengganu the second state in Malaysia to be ruled by the Islamist party (the first being neighbouring Kelantan). Barisan Nasional were brought back into power in Terengganu in the 2004 Malaysian general election, which continued to govern it until the 2018 Malaysian general election.

==Geography==

Terengganu is situated in eastern Peninsular Malaysia, and is bordered to the northwest by Kelantan, to the southwest by Pahang, and to the east by the South China Sea. The state has a total area of . Its topographical profile ranges from relatively level on the east coast and gradually becomes more hilly and mountainous towards the west, as its western borders are delineated by the Pantai Timur Range, with the highest point being Mount Lawit. The range acts as the main watershed for the state&#x27;s riverine systems, as it is also home to Kenyir Lake, which is the source of the Terengganu River, is the largest man-made lake in Malaysia and serves as the state&#x27;s major reservoir. Several outlying islands, including the Perhentians, Kapas and Redang, are also a part of the state.

==Politics and government==


===Constitution===
The Constitution of Terengganu came into force in 1911. It has a supplement that came into force in 1959. The official English title for the 1911 constitution is &quot;The Constitution of the Way of Illustrious Sovereignty&quot;. The 1959 constitutional supplement is divided into two sections. The sections&#x27; official English language titles are &quot;The Laws of the Constitution of Terengganu (First Part)&quot; and &quot;The Laws of the Constitution of Terengganu (Second Part)&quot;

===The Sultan of Terengganu===

The Sultan is the constitutional ruler of the state of Terengganu. The State Constitution proclaims that the Sultan is &quot;the Ruler and fountain head of all authority of government in the State and Territory of Terengganu&quot;, the Head of the Religion of Islam in the state and the source of all titles, honours and dignities in the state. He is also vested with the Executive Power of the State. The hereditary Sultan of Terengganu since 1998 has been Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin.

====Regency====
As per both the Malaysian and state constitutions, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or King of Malaysia cannot simultaneously reign as federal Head of State and ruler of his own state. This means that a state ruler must appoint a regent to govern in his absence. Between 2006 and 2011, the current Sultan served as the 13th King of Malaysia, naming his eldest son and heir apparent, Tengku Muhammad Ismail, as Regent (&quot;Pemangku Raja&quot;) of Terengganu. As he was only eight years old upon his father&#x27;s election, the young Prince co-reigned with a three-member Regency Advisory Council (&quot;Majlis Penasihat Pemangku Raja&quot;) headed by Raja Tengku Baderulzaman (the King&#x27;s younger brother) as dictated by &quot;syarat (2) Fasal 16 AA Undang-Undang Bagi Diri Kerajaan Terengganu (Bab Yang Kedua)&quot; of the Terengganu State Constitution.

=== Chief Ministers ===

When Terengganu was an absolute monarchy, the Chief Minister was selected by the Sultan. Since the declaration of independence of Malaysia &quot;(then called Tanah Melayu)&quot; and the first general election, the Chief Minister has been the State Assembly (ADUN) member elected by a majority of all State Assembly members, who are themselves elected by universal adult suffrage of the citizens of their constituencies. Below is the list of the Chief Ministers of Terengganu from 1925.

Note:* The state Government formed by PAS after the general election in 1959 was turned over to Perikatan in Nov 1961, due to a vote of no confidence in the State Assembly and the fact that two PAS assemblymen switched parties

====2008 Menteri Besar appointment crisis====

Following the ruling party UMNO&#x27;s return to power over Terengganu after winning 24 out of 32 seats in the 2008 general elections, Prime Minister (PM) Abdullah Ahmad Badawi put forth the reappointment of Datuk Seri Idris Jusoh to a second term as Menteri Besar. In what political analysts described as a possible constitutional crisis, trouble began to precipitate after the Sultan of Terengganu, Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin, who is also the then Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) of Malaysia refused to re-appoint and swear in Idris as Menteri Besar. Similar problems occurred in the state of Perlis where the PM&#x27;s choice was also rejected, in which the latter eventually gave in to its Sultan.

The Sultan of Terengganu appointed Ahmad Said instead for the job, with the Regency Advisory Council handing him the letter of appointment. The PM claimed that the appointment of Ahmad Said was unconstitutional as it went against the wishes of the assemblymen and the Prime Minister&#x27;s office who have supported Idris Jusoh candidacy for Menteri Besar.

In spite of threats to strip Ahmad Said of his party membership &quot;for disobeying the leadership&quot;, he went to the office in Wisma Darul Iman to begin the first day of his new appointment on 25 March 2008. The party announced earlier that they made good on their promise to remove his membership, which technically disqualifies him to be appointed as Menteri Besar in the first place. The ruling also planned to vote down the sultan&#x27;s choice through a motion of no-confidence by 22 UMNO state assemblymen.

The opposition party Parti Islam SeMalaysia in the meantime promised that its assemblymen would support Ahmad Said as Menteri Besar.

On 26 March 2008 however, PM Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin met at Istana Negara to resolve the deadlock. The Prime Minister reversed his stance and decided to accept the King&#x27;s appointment of Ahmad Said as Chief Minister of Terengganu. He also apologised to the King for the public spat over the appointment of the Menteri Besar, explaining that there was no intention to disparage or humiliate the royal household.

The apparent backdown was due to threat that the royal household would be prepared to dissolve the state assembly if the motion of no-confidence was initiated against Ahmad Said, which would trigger another election in what is already a climate of discontent towards the ruling party and the possibility of dissenting assemblymen defecting to the opposition.

The UMNO Supreme Council proceeded to endorse Ahmad Said as the new Menteri Besar of Terengganu. With the resolution of the impasse, Ahmad Said expressed his gratefulness on his appointment and paid tribute to Idris, an old friend he has known since university, for the work he has done for the Terengganu people so far and to seek his advice. After the swearing in ceremony where the duties are handed over from Idris, he also expressed hopes in moving on to discharge his responsibility to the people and eradicate poverty within the state.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Terengganu is divided into 8 districts (&quot;daerah&quot;), 99 &quot;mukims&quot;, and 7 local governments.

On 18 September 2014, it was announced that the Kuala Terengganu District sub-district of Kuala Nerus would become Terengganu&#x27;s 8th district, to be called Kuala Nerus by sixth Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak.

=== Sharia Law ===
The state is ruled by Sharia Law which only applies to Muslims. In 2002, the state of Terengganu passed Syariah Criminal Offenses (Hudud And Qisas) Enactment 2002 which would allow canings, amputation of hands, stoning and crucifixion however this was unenforced due to the limit set in Act 355. In September 2018, two women were given six strokes of the cane for attempting to have same-sex relations.

==Demographics==

Terengganu has a population of 1,015,776 , which increased to 1,149,440 in 2020. The official mid-year estimate in 2023 was 1,209,400. In 2006, Malays made up 94.7% of the population and Chinese, 2.6%, while Indians 0.2% and other ethnic groups comprise the remainder, 2.4%. According to the 2010 census, the ethnic composition of Terengganu was 97% Bumiputras, 2.6% Chinese, 0.2% Indian, and 0.1% others.

In 2000, the state&#x27;s population was only 48.7% urban; the majority lived in rural areas. By the 2005 census, the proportions had changed significantly, with 51% of the population living in urban areas and 49% in the rural areas. Terengganu recorded the lowest life expectancy in Malaysia for both males and females for the period 2021-2023.

===Ethnic groups===

Terengganu is one of Malaysia&#x27;s most homogeneous states along with Kelantan. More than 95% of the population is ethnically Malay, but there are other ethnic groups that live in the state as well, including Chinese (mostly Hokkien), Indians (mostly Tamils), Siamese, and Orang Aslis (Batek and Semaq Beri).

====Malays====
Malays are the largest ethnic group in the state with more than 94% of the population. The Malays in Terengganu are distinct from Malays of other parts of the country, they have unique cultures, traditions and spoken language. There are two sub-groups of Malays in the state:

Terengganu Malays

Terengganu Malays are the majority Malay sub-group in the state. They are the dominant Malay sub-group in all districts of Terengganu except for Besut and northern Setiu. They habitually speak Terengganu Malay language which is distinct but closely related to Kelantanese variety in the north. Terengganu Malays are also known for their rich cultures and traditions, one of the most well known is the Ulek Mayang.

Besut Malays

Besut Malays are predominantly found in the district of Besut and northern Setiu. Despite being Terengganu citizens, they are ethnically, linguistically, and culturally closer to, and still maintain strong ties with, Kelantan. Most Malays in Besut and northern Setiu speak only Kelantanese, although those who have long been exposed to other districts of Terengganu can speak Terengganuan as well.

====Chinese====
The Chinese Terengganuan form the largest minority ethnic group in the state. They are mostly Hokkien by ancestry and speak a dialect of Hokkien. Unlike other parts of Malaysia, the Chinese in Terengganu are much more assimilated; they speak fluent local Malay (Terengganuan in most parts of Terengganu and Kelantanese in Besut) and also share a similar lifestyle. They also have a local Peranakan culture known as &quot;Mek Awang&quot; which is a mixture of Chinese (mostly Hokkien) and Malay (Terengganu Malay) cultures, which can be seen in their cuisine and clothing and their language as well.

====Indian====
Indians in Terengganu are mostly Tamils and the majority are adherents of Hinduism, although a minority follow Islam. Like their Chinese counterparts, the Indian community in Terengganu are highly assimilated, with many fluent in Terengganu Malay along with Tamil, Standard Malay and English. There is one major Hindu temple in Kuala Terengganu. Most Indians in Terengganu live in urban areas like Kuala Terengganu.

====Siamese====
The Siamese in Terengganu maintain a small but well-organised community. They can be found in Besut and few in Setiu and Kuala Terengganu. Physically, there is little difference between Malays and Siamese other than their name and religion. Their native language is Southern Thai language but most speak Kelantanese as large numbers of them live in Besut.

====Orang Asli====
The Orang Aslis are the indigenous peoples of Peninsular Malaysia. In Terengganu they can be found mostly in Hulu Terengganu and Besut districts. There are two Orang Asli ethnic groups in Terengganu, the Semaq Beris live near Lake Kenyir or other parts of the district. They belong to Senoi group. Besides the Semaq Beris, there are also Batek people, a Semang ethnic group mostly found in interior parts of Terengganu, especially in Taman Negara area or in other parts of Terengganu. Both Semaq Beris and Bateks still maintain their semi-nomadic lifestyle, although some now live in permanent homes. Both are also speakers of Austroasiatic languages.

===Languages===
The people of Terengganu generally speak Coastal Terengganu Malay, which is distinct from standard Malay and Kelantan-Pattani Malay, except for those in Besut district, Perhentian Islands and some parts of Setiu where Kelantanese are more dominant. Those that live in Hulu Terengganu had their own distinct variant but closely related to Coastal Terengganu Malay. Chinese Terengganuans are predominantly Hoklo people and thus mostly speak Hokkien as their first language, although a number of Mandarin speakers are increasing. Indians in Terengganu mostly speak Malaysian Tamil. There is also an Orang Asli languages such as Batek and Semaq Beri, spoken in inland parts of Terengganu and is part of the Austroasiatic language family. There is also a small number of Cham language speakers spoken by a small community of Cham people in Dungun.

===Religion===
According to the 2020 Census, the population of Terengganu is 97.3% Muslim, 2% Buddhist, 0.2% Hindu, 0.2% Christian, and 0.04% follower of Chinese folk religions or unknown affiliation.

Statistics from the 2010 Census indicate that 91.4% of the Chinese population are identified as Buddhists, with significant minorities of adherents identifying as Christians (4.7%), Chinese folk religions (1.6%) and Muslims (1.4%). The majority of the Indian population are Hindus (69.8%), with a significant minorities of numbers identifying as Muslims (18.1%), Christians (5.3%) and Buddhists (4.9%). The non-Malay &quot;bumiputera&quot; community are predominantly Muslims (56.8%), with significant minorities identifying as Christians (33.2%) and Buddhists (5.6%). All Malays are Muslims.

==Economy==
Terengganu used to be Malaysia&#x27;s poorest state until oil and gas were discovered off its coastline in the 80s. Terengganu&#x27;s main industry now is petroleum and gas. There are huge petrochemical complexes near Paka and Kerteh, involving many joint ventures between the Malaysian national oil company, Petronas, and foreign multinationals. Tourism and fishing are also major industries in Terengganu, a state with a long coastline. Agriculture also remains important, with banana, rambutan, durian, watermelon, and various other fruits and vegetables available in season. Terengganu was traditionally famous for boatbuilding, with highly decorated carved wooden boats called &quot;bangau&quot; to be found in the harbour of every village and town in days not so long gone by, before electric motorboats became standard equipment for the state&#x27;s fishermen.

==Culture and attractions==


Terengganu did not receive many Indian or Chinese migrants, and therefore Malay cultural influences predominate. Traditional pursuits such as kite-flying contests, top-spinning contests, and traditional arts &amp; crafts, such as batik and songket are still very much alive. The people of Terengganu have always had a reputation for being socially conservative and devout Muslims.

The major tourist attractions in the state include: Kuala Terengganu, the capital; Islamic Heritage Park, Tasik Kenyir, a large artificial lake; Sekayu Waterfalls; Kuala Ibai Lagoons; Batu Burok Beach, Kemasik Beach, Rantau Abang, Setiu Wetlands, Marang, Chukai town and several offshore islands such as Pulau Redang, Pulau Lang Tengah, and Pulau Kapas, and the Pulau Perhentian, which attract beachgoers and snorkelers because of their picture perfect beaches. Many travellers find the relatively rural and tranquil atmosphere in the state conducive to a relaxing holiday.

Terengganu has recently been known internationally as the host of Monsoon Cup, which was first held in 2005 and then became an annual national sporting event. The event brought millions of ringgit of investment into the state from the private sectors and Malaysian Government. Tourists flocked to Kuala Terengganu and Duyong to witness this event, held during the monsoon season, which had previously been low season for tourism in Terengganu.

=== Culture ===
Terengganu, along with Kelantan, is known as the cradle of the Malay civilization in Peninsular Malaysia. There are various traditional dances in the state such as the Ulek Mayang, Rodat, Saba, Balai, and Nur Sakti; some even predate the arrival of Islam in the region. Terengganu is also one of few states to adopt the gamelan as part of their traditional theatre (after Riau and Pahang); the Terengganu gamelan has developed a distinct identity from Sundanese and Javanese gamelan. The gamelan was originally brought to Pahang and later to Terengganu, and was played only during royal occasions. Today the gamelan is part of the state&#x27;s cultural heritage.

Other public airport is the Redang Airport, located in Redang Island off the coast of Terengganu.

Keio traces its history to 1858 when Fukuzawa Yukichi, who had studied the Western educational system at Brown University in the United States, started to teach Dutch while he was a guest of the Okudaira family. In 1868 he changed the name of the school to Keio Gijuku and devoted his time to education. While Keio&#x27;s initial identity was that of a private school of Western studies, it expanded and established its first university faculty in 1890.

Keio has approximately 30 Research Centres located on its five main campuses and at other facilities for advanced research in Japan. Keio University Research Institute at SFC (KRIS) has joined the MIT and the French INRIA in hosting the international W3C.

Eight international students entered from Taiwan (which had technically been a territory of the Japanese Empire since 1895) the following year. In 1946, Keio University began accepting female students. In 2006, a paper was published in the research journal &quot;Science&quot; with an undergraduate as its first listed author.

<text>The Gunbarrel Highway is an isolated desert track in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia. It consists of about of washaways, heavy corrugations, stone, sand and flood plains. The Gunbarrel Highway connects Victory Downs in the Northern Territory to Carnegie Station in Western Australia. Some sources incorrectly show the highway extending west to Wiluna.

The road was built as part of Australia&#x27;s role in the weapons research establishment called Woomera which included Emu Field and Maralinga, both atomic bomb testing sites. The name comes from Len Beadell&#x27;s Gunbarrel Road Construction Party, so named as his intention was to build roads as straight as a gunbarrel. The highway was protested by the Australian group Midnight Oil in their song of the same name as the highway.

== History ==
There were three main reasons for the construction of the Gunbarrel Highway. The first was to provide access for a future meteorological station which was needed to forecast upper winds prior to the testing of atomic weapons in South Australia. The second was for instrumentation along the centre-line of fire for rockets launched from Woomera. The third was to allow surveyors from the Australian Division of National Mapping to continue the geodetic survey of little known areas of outback Australia. A consequence of the construction was the completion of the first east-west road link across the centre of Australia.

===First stage===
The road was built in four stages beginning in 1955. In early November, the Gunbarrel Road Construction Party (GRCP) assembled near Coober Pedy in South Australia, half coming from Adelaide together with a bulldozer, and half with a grader from Maralinga, led by Len Beadell. The starting point was Victory Downs homestead just north of the border with the Northern Territory, and west of the Stuart Highway.

Work began on 13 November 1955, and continued westward to Mulga Park. An interruption occurred after about when the grader&#x27;s blade mounting bolts were snapped after hitting a submerged Mulga tree root. Beadell made a hurried return trip to Alice Springs for parts. The road reached Mulga Park on 2 December, where construction ceased for the year, as the bulldozer&#x27;s starting pilot motor had failed.

Beadell continued ahead on a ground reconnaissance, then on 7 December made an aerial survey which departed from a natural airstrip in the Mount Davies vicinity, and flew towards the Rawlinson Ranges where the future weather station was to be located. With the knowledge gained, Beadell led a ground party of four Land Rovers to the site where a stone cairn was built on 12 December. The site was named Giles after Ernest Giles, the first European to explore the area in 1874. Beadell&#x27;s Land Rover suffered a broken rear axle during the return towards Mount Davies, so an axle was borrowed from one of the other vehicles which was left behind to be recovered the following year.

===Second stage===
In February 1956, the second stage continued from Mulga Park to the Musgrave Ranges, then in March via the Mann Ranges and Tomkinson Ranges to Giles where the party arrived on 29 March. Beadell had hoped to take the road via Surveyor Generals Corner, but it was too rocky for road building. The first priority in establishing the weather station was to find water.

A boring plant was obtained from the nearest railhead to the east. It was slowly towed to Giles by the grader, and on the fourth drilling attempt, suitable drinking water was discovered. Work on the Giles establishment continued throughout April and May, which included laying out the airstrip. In June Beadell and the GRCP were called away to begin work on the Mount Davies road.

In 1957, no further work took place on the Gunbarrel Highway. Beadell continued work at Giles during the early months.

===Third stage===
The third stage of the highway began with a solo reconnaissance by Beadell from Giles to Warburton on 12 March 1958, when the weather was still very hot. In his book &quot;Too Long in the Bush&quot;, Beadell described the forbidding conditions in a chapter which he called &quot;An Unshared Nightmare&quot;. Daytime temperatures were between , which resulted in an overheating engine and fuel vaporisation. The extreme heat melted plastic parts of his instrument panel and radio transmitter, and loosened nails in his boots which caused the heels to fall off. 

He lost his appetite and drank hot water only. His course took him along the southern edge of the Rawlinson Range towards Lake Christopher, then southwards through the eastern edge of the Gibson Desert. After battling through a series of jumbled sand ridges, and having three flat tyres, he found that his water supply was almost exhausted. When clear of the ridges, some rocky hills led to his discovery of a small pool of water in a creek run-off, which saved his life. He arrived at Warburton and rested for three days prior to the return journey to Giles via a different route.

After a delay caused by rain, building of the next section started on 22 March from Giles, keeping to the north and west of his earlier reconnaissance route, avoiding known obstacles. The road passed close by the position where it was estimated that Alfred Gibson had perished, then turned south towards Warburton, which was reached by early May. While at Warburton, Beadell and his team built a new airstrip much closer to the mission settlement.

===Fourth stage===

Building of the fourth stage did not commence until an altered arrangement for the survey took place. On this occasion, the survey reconnaissance from near Warburton to Carnegie was led by (Bill) Johnson from the Senior Geodetic Surveyor Division of National Mapping, who was responsible for the planning and conduct of the Australian Geodetic Survey in that area. Johnson and Beadell both served in the Australian Survey Corps in the Second World War. 

Johnson and Beadell each had a Land Rover in the advance party, and they were followed by two other Land Rovers and a supply truck. The second group included an officer from headquarters in Woomera, and an aboriginal affairs officer. Meanwhile, most of the GRCP returned to Giles, leaving the heavy equipment at a future turn-off (Jackie Junction) north of Warburton. The survey from the turn-off west towards Carnegie Station took place from 14 to 28 May during which a mountain was found. It was named Mount Beadell in honour of Beadell.

Construction of the final section began at Jackie Junction on 3 September, was abeam Mount Beadell on the 25 September, Everard Junction (with the Gary Highway) around 15 October, and reached Carnegie Station on 15 November 1958, just over three years from when the Gunbarrel Highway was begun. The length of new road built from Victory Downs was .

== Conditions ==
The route is a long and tough haul through very remote territory. Its isolation requires travellers to be totally self-sufficient with water, food and fuel. The longest distance between fuel outlets is , between Warburton and Carnegie Station. Part of the road between Jackie Junction and Warakurna, near Giles, is now known as the Old Gunbarrel Highway, and is no longer maintained due to the construction of the more direct route, the Great Central Road.

The route passes directly into Aboriginal land. It is a legal requirement for travellers to hold a valid transit permit at the time of travel. Three free permits are required in Western Australia and a permit is required to enter the APY Lands in South Australia. 

Permits for the abandoned section from Warakurna and Warburton require at least two vehicles and either a HF radio or satellite telephone and requires a minimum of five working days turnaround. Entry to the abandoned section is only permitted at Warakurna or Warburton. Access to the abandoned section via Jackie Junction is not permitted. Jackie Junction Road is on sacred land and not open to the public.

<text>The cinema of Canada dates back to the earliest known display of film in Saint-Laurent, Quebec, in 1896. The film industry in Canada has been dominated by the United States, which has utilized Canada as a shooting location and to bypass British film quota laws, throughout its history. Canadian filmmakers, English and French, have been active in the development of cinema in the United States.

Films by Thomas A. Edison, Inc. were some of the first to arrive in Canada and early films made in the country were produced by Edison Studios. Canadian Pacific Railway and other railways supported early filmmaking including James Freer, whose &quot;Ten Years in Manitoba&quot; was the first known film by a Canadian. &quot;Evangeline&quot; is the earliest recorded Canadian feature film. George Brownridge and Ernest Shipman were major figures in Canadian cinema in the 1920s and 1930s. Shipman oversaw the production the most expensive film up to that point. Brownridge&#x27;s career led to &quot;Carry on, Sergeant!&quot; and its failure caused a decline in the film industry.

The Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau was formed in 1918, and expanded to sound and 16 mm film in the 1930s before merging into the National Film Board of Canada. The NFB expanded under the leadership of John Grierson. The Canadian Cooperation Project between the government and Motion Picture Association of America from 1948 to 1958, negatively affected Canadian filmmaking. Internal divisions between English and French Canadians within the NFB starting in the 1940s led to the creation of an independent branch for French language productions by the 1960s. The government provided financial support to the film industry through the Capital Cost Allowance and Telefilm Canada.

==History==
===Film===
====Arrival of film====

The first time a film was displayed in Canada, and one of the first times in North America, was at an event organized by Louis Minier and Louis Pupier using a cinematograph in Saint-Laurent, Quebec, on 27 June 1896. Prior to the discovery of the Saint-Laurent showing by Germain Lacasse in 1984, it was believed that a showing conducted by Andrew M. Holland and George C. Holland, where films by Thomas A. Edison, Inc. such as &quot;The Kiss&quot; were shown, in Ottawa, from 21 July to 28 August 1896, was the first. The Saint-Laurent showing was overlooked as English researchers did not search through French sources. Léo-Ernest Ouimet stated that he attended the showing and he was used as evidence of it until Lacasse found newspaper coverage of the event in &quot;La Presse&quot;.

R.A. Hardie and F.H. Wall also presented films in Winnipeg from 18 to 25 July 1896. Marie Tréourret de Kerstrat and her son Henry de Grandsaignes d’Hauterives were some of the first French people to display films to French Canadians and projected hundreds during their tours from 1897 to 1906. They showed 8,000 feet of hand-coloured film done by Georges Méliès, which is the earliest known colour film shown in Canada.

The development of a Canadian film industry was hampered by the country&#x27;s low population density, it had six million inhabitants and only Toronto and Montreal had more than 100,000 people in 1905, and the lack of domestic vaudeville as most of the acts came from the United States, United Kingdom, and France. Andrew Holland was critical of Canada as a place for the film industry due to the quality of its films, distance between major urban areas, and different electrical systems. Early films were used to as promotional material for companies, promote immigration, or displays of scenic locations including Niagara Falls. The Edison Company created some of the first films in Canada by documenting the Klondike Gold Rush, Canadian soldiers leaving to fight in the Second Boer War, and George V, the Duke of York, arriving in Canada in 1902.

James Freer is believed to have been the first Canadian to produce films. He purchased an Edison camera and projector and started filming agriculture activities and Canadian Pacific Railway trains in 1897, and toured the United Kingdom with the sponsorship of the CPR in 1898, and a second less successful tour was sponsored by Clifford Sifton in 1901. His second tour was the first time that the government was directly involved with film. British and American filmmakers were selected as they could guarantee the distribution of their films unlike Canadian filmmakers. The CPR enlisted Charles Urban and his company, in order to allow the distribution of the films to the United Kingdom, to travel and film Canada to promote settlement in the western areas. This group, the Bioscope Company of Canada, conducted filming in Quebec to Victoria from 1902 to 1903. The film, &quot;Living Canada&quot;, was premiered at the Palace Theatre in 1903, with High Commissioner Donald Smith in attendance. A total of thirty-five &quot;Living Canada&quot; films were released by 1904, and was reedited into &quot;Wonders of Canada&quot; in 1906. Urban success led to him gaining contracts with the government of British Columbia and the Northern Railway Company. The Grand Trunk Railway entered the industry by hiring Butcher&#x27;s Film Service in 1909. The CPR hired the Edison Company to film in Canada and they sent nine people, including J. Searle Dawley, Henry Cronjager, and Mabel Trunnelle, in 1910. They were provided a specialized train and the RMS Empress of India and produced thirteen films.

====Creating an independent film industry====

Silent films used intertitles in English and French, but sound films were mostly produced in English. The first recorded feature film created in Canada was &quot;Evangeline&quot;. The Palace was the first theatre to transition to showing sound films when it presented &quot;Street Angel&quot; on 1 September 1928. There were multiple attempts to create an independent film industry in Canada in the early 20th century. Thirty-six companies meant for film production were created between 1914 and 1922, but the majority of the companies did not produce any films.

In 1914, &quot;Canadian Animated Weekly&quot; by Universal Pictures became one of the first newsreels in Canada. Ouimet, who was a pioneer for Canadian newsreels, created Specialty Film Import in 1915, as a distributor, but his newsreel and distribution companies were sold in 1923, and he unsuccessfully worked in the United States in the 1920s. At the peak of Ouimet&#x27;s career 1.5 million Canadians were watching his newsreels twice per week. Domestic newsreel companies were unsuccessful after branches of American companies, Fox Canadian News and Canadian Kinograms, were established.

Most sound films from Quebec in the 1910s and 1920s are lost. Yves Lever stated that Larente-Homier&#x27;s 1922 film &quot;Madeleine de Verchères&quot; was the first truly Québécois fictional feature film. Larente-Homier&#x27;s work was later destroyed by his son due to orders from the Fire Bureau as the film reels were flammable.

Ernest Shipman established multiple film companies in cities and would produce a limited number of films using local money before moving to another area. Unlike other Canadian filmmakers he sought financial support from the American market. In 1919, incorporated Canadian Photoplays with a financial capital of $250,000 in Alberta. He started production on &quot;Wapi, the Walrus&quot;, but retitled it to &quot;Back to God&#x27;s Country&quot; to capitalize &quot;God&#x27;s Country and the Woman&quot;, starring his wife Nell Shipman. The film was a critical and financial success, with it grossing over $500,000 in its first year, and Shipman&#x27;s investors saw a 300% return on investment. Despite the success of the film Canadian Photoplays did not produce another film and went into voluntary liquidation. He signed a contract with Ralph Connor in 1919, and formed Dominion Films, based in New York, to produce films in Winnipeg. Winnipeg Productions was formed to adapt twelve of Connor&#x27;s stories, but only five were filmed. Shipman created five companies across Canada in 1922, but only three produced films. He incorporated New Brunswick Films on 23 August 1922, but the failure of &quot;Blue Water&quot; ended Shipman&#x27;s career.

Trenton, Ontario, despite its small size, was a major film production area and had one of the few studios to last longer than a few years. Canadian National Features, founded by George Brownridge, construction a studio in the town and raised a financial capital of $500,000, with $278,000 coming within the first week, in 1916. However, the company suspended production after spending $43,000 on its first two films, &quot;The Marriage Trap&quot; and &quot;Power&quot;, and declared bankruptcy with $79,000 in assets. The studio in Trenton was taken over by the Pan American Film Corporation in 1918, but only released one film before closing. Brownridge founded Adanac Producing Company and released the two Canadian National Features films in 1918. Brownridge shifted production towards corporate sponsorships by displaying products in dramatized films. Brownridge sought a sponsorship from the CPR and John Murray Gibbon saw &quot;Power&quot; and asked Brownridge to make anti-Bolshevik films during the First Red Scare. Adanac was reorganized in 1919, with Brownridge as its managing director and Denis Tansey, a member of parliament, as its president. &quot;The Great Shadow&quot; was released in 1920, after being filmed in Canada rather than New York as Brownridge wanted to create a domestic film industry, and was a critical and financial success although the CPR pulled its public support before its release. However, the company went bankrupt with Brownridge balming Harley Knoles&#x27;s wastefulness and Selznick Pictures&#x27;s distribution policy. Brownridge sold the Trenton studio to the Ontario Motion Picture Bureau in 1924, and it continued to be used, with &quot;Carry on, Sergeant!&quot; as the sole fictional work filmed there, until Mitchell Hepburn ordered its closure in 1934, and it was turned into a community centre.

Motion Skreenadz, incorporated in 1920, conducted the majority of film production in western Canada and brought colour film production to British Columbia. Leon C. Shelly gained control over Motion Skreenadz and Vancouver Motion Pictures from 1936 to 1937. He extended the company to Toronto in 1945, but relocated the company entirely to Toronto in 1946. The company was reorganized into Shelly Films, but production of non-newsreels was ended in favor of focusing on film laboratories.

British Columbia&#x27;s government agencies used promotional films from 1908 to 1919, before the creation of the British Columbia Patriotic and Educational Picture Service. It was headed by A. R. Baker and mainly distributed films produced under contract by Arthur D. Kean. The provincial legislature passed legislation requiring the display of at least one ten-minute education film or travelogue during all of the programs. The Motion Picture Branch of the Bureau of Publications was created by Saskatchewan in 1924, to produce education films.

The Ontario Motion Picture Bureau was established in 1917, but did not produce its own films until 1923. S.C. Johnson, who worked in the Ontario Agriculture Department, was its first director. The victory of the United Farmers of Ontario in the 1919 election resulted in Peter Smith reorganized film production under the Amusement Branch with Otter Elliott heading it. He changed the focus of filmmaking from agricultural training towards quality productions. By 1925, the bureau had 2,000 films in its library, distributed 1,500 reels of film per month, and made one feature-length documentary, Cinderella of the Farms in 1931, but the bureau was dissolved after the Ontario Liberal Party won in the 1934 Ontario general election.

Albert Tessier and Maurice Proulx produced large amounts of films in French at a time when it was uncommon. Joseph Morin, the Quebec Minister of Agriculture, used film for education purposes and the Service de ciné-photographie was established in 1941.

The War Office Cinematographic Committee, one of the first times the national government was involved in filmmaking, was formed in 1916, and was led by Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook. The committee contracted the Topical Film Company before buying a controlling share. The committee aided in the production of distribution of D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Hearts of the World&quot;. The committee was dissolved after World War I and its shares in Topical Film Company were sold, which were donated to war charities.

The Associated Screen News of Canada was founded by Bernard Norrish in 1920, and the CPR held a majority control of its stock. The company grew from two employees in 1920, to over one hundred by 1930, and focused on the production of newsreels, theatrical shorts, and sponsored films. It was the largest Canadian film company until the growth of Crawley Films in the 1950s. It was one of Canada&#x27;s longest lasting film production companies with Crawley Films and the National Film Board of Canada being one of the few to outlast it. Before ASN constructed a film laboratory all of the film print distributed in Canada were processed in the United States. The company was processing twenty-two million feet of film in per year by 1929. ASN constructed a sound stage in 1936, and produced &quot;House in Order&quot;, which was its only feature film in the 1930s.

Brownridge was sent to New York in 1925 by the Ontario Motion Picture Bureau to gain a distribution contract, but only negotiated one with Cranfield and Clarke after a year of high expenses. Treasurer William Herbert Price criticized Brownridge stating that his &quot;travelling expenses are very high and I do not see there was very much result from anything he has done&quot;. George Patton, the bureau&#x27;s head, supported the deal as Cranfield and Clarke had no Jews in its company. W.F. Clarke, who was later blamed for the company&#x27;s financial failure, pushed for Canadian film production and came up with an idea of a film about &quot;a dramatic story written by an eminent authority around the part played by the Canadians in the World War&quot;. Clarke incorporated British Empire Films of Canada in June 1927. The film adaption of &quot;The Better &#x27;Ole&quot; was released in Canada under the name &quot;Carry On!&quot; and was financially success. Clarke&#x27;s film was named &quot;Carry on, Sergeant!&quot; to help raise funds. It received financial backing from influential people, including prime ministers Arthur Meighen and Bennett. The film started production, by the recently created subsidiary Canadian International Films, in 1926, and Bruce Bairnsfather was hired to direct with an expensive contract, but his inexperience with film led to production troubles that increased the cost of the budget. The production difficulties led to internal company problems and Clarke was removed as general manager although he remained vice-president.

The film was released in 1928, to mixed-to-negative reviews and was only distributed in Ontario before the company went bankrupt in 1929. Brownridge attempted to recut and release the film in 1930, stating that it &quot;would gross at least $200,000&quot;, but it did not happen. The Ontario government was still interested in attempting to create a large film studio by 1932, along with Edward Wentworth Beatty and Herbert Samuel Holt, but the recent failure of Canadian International Films and Great Depression led to its not receiving investments. The Canadian film industry would not recover until after World War II.

====National Film Board====


The Exhibits and Publicity Bureau was founded on 19 September 1918, and was reorganized into the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau on 1 April 1923. Its films were theatrically released in the United States by Bray Productions. The organization&#x27;s budget stagnated and declined during the Great Depression. The organization was led by Bernard Norrish from 1917 to 1920, Raymond Peck from 1920 to 1927, and Frank Badgley from 1927 to 1941. Badgley stated that the bureau needed to transition to sound films or else it would lose its access to theatrical releases, but the organization did not gain the equipment until 1934, and by then it had lost its theatrical distributors. Badgley was able to get a 16 mm film facility for the bureau in 1931. The organization&#x27;s budget fell from $75,000 in 1930, to $65,000 in 1931, and $45,000 in 1932. However, its budget was increased to $70,000 in 1933. The bureau was reorganized into the National Film Board of Canada in 1941, following John Grierson&#x27;s recommendation.

Ross McLean was working as the secretary to High Commissioner Vincent Massey when he met Grierson, and asked for Grierson to come to Canada to aide in the governmental film policy. Grierson made a report on the Canadian film industry in 1938, and the National Film Act, which he drafted, was passed in 1939 causing the creation of the NFB. Grierson became the first Film Commissioner of the NFB and served until the end of World War II. Employment rose from fifty to over seven hundred from 1941 to 1945, although it was cut by 40% after the war ended. Grierson selected McLean to work as assistant commissioner and Stuart Legg to oversee the productions.

&quot;Lest We Forget&quot;, Canada&#x27;s first feature-length war documentary with sound, was released in 1935. Grierson made efforts to increase the theatrical distribution of NFB films, primarily its war-related films, as he was coordinating wartime information for the United Kingdom in North America. Famous Players aided in distribution and the Canadian Motion Picture War Services Committee, which worked with the War Activities Committee of the Motion Pictures Industry, was founded in 1940. NFB productions such as &quot;The World in Action&quot; was watched by 30-40 million people per month in the United Kingdom and United States in 1943, and &quot;Canada Carries On&quot; was watched by 2.25 million people by 1944. The audience for NFB newsreels reached 40-50 million per week by 1944.

Grierson opposed feature film production as he believed that Canada did not have a large enough market for an independent feature film industry. He supported working with American film companies and stated that &quot;the theatre film business is an international business, dependent when it comes to distribution on an alliance or understanding with American film interests&quot;. He travelled to Hollywood in 1944, and the NFB sent scripts to American companies for consideration.

Grierson lacked strong support in the Canadian government and some of his films received opposition from members of the government. &quot;Inside Fighting Russia&quot; was criticized for its support of the Russian Revolution and &quot;Balkan Powderkeg&quot; for criticizing the United Kingdom&#x27;s policy in the Balkans. Grierson and the NFB were attacked during the onset of the Cold War. The Federal Bureau of Investigation created a file on Grierson in 1942, due to the &quot;World in Action&quot; newsreel being considered too left-wing. Leo Dolan, an ally of Hepburn and the head of the Canadian Government Travel Bureau, accused Grierson of being Jewish and a Co-operative Commonwealth Federation supporter. The Gouzenko Affair implicated Freda Linton, one of Grierson&#x27;s secretaries, and the organization was criticized by the Progressive Conservative Party for subversive tendencies, financial waste, and being a monopoly. Grierson was also accused of being involved, but was proven not to be although he resigned as commissioner in 1945.

McLean was ordered to assist the Royal Canadian Mounted Police screen NFB employees and the RCMP requested him to fire a list of employees. McLean, who refused to fire any employees without their disloyalty being proven, was not reappointed as commissioner and replaced by William Arthur Irwin in 1950. Irwin also refused to fire employees without proven disloyalty and reduced the demand and only three of the thirty-six requested were fired.

The Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences, with Massey as its chair, was formed in 1949. The NFB submitted a brief asking to have a headquarters constructed, budget increases, and to become a Crown corporation. Robert Winters, whose ministry oversaw the NFB, stated that its brief did not represent government policy. The Association of Motion Picture Producers and Laboratories of Canada submitted a brief criticizing a government monopoly, with the NFB&#x27;s crown corporation request being referred to as an &quot;expansionist, monopolistic psychology&quot;, and that they were unable to compete with the NFB as it paid no taxes and was exempt from tariffs. The commission&#x27;s report supported the NFB and its requests for Crown corporation status and a headquarters were accepted.

A Canadian tour by Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip was filmed and was initially meant to be two reels, worth twenty minutes, but grew to five reels as they could not determine what to cut. Irwin met with Harvey Harnick, the NFB&#x27;s Columbia theatrical distributor, and J.J. Fitzgibbons, the president of Famous Players, and Fitzgibbons told Irwin that he would screen all five reels if the film was completed for a Christmas release. &quot;Royal Journey&quot; opened in seventeen first-run theatres and over course of the next two years it was screened in 1,249 Canadian theatres where it was watched by a record two million people and the film was also screened in forty other countries. The film cost $88,000, but the NFB gained a profit of $150,000 and the film&#x27;s success was one of the reasons Grierson stated that Irwin &quot;saved the Film Board&quot;. It was seen by over two million people within two months.

The Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau and Associated Screen News of Canada had no French-Canadian employees. Vincent Paquette became the NFB&#x27;s first French-Canadian filmmaker in 1941, and directed &quot;La Cité de Notre-Dame&quot;, the board&#x27;s first in-house French-language film, in 1942. The number of French-Canadian employees grew to seventeen by 1945, and a quarter of the board&#x27;s budget was spent on French productions. The Massey Commission and Gratien Gélinas, a member of the NFB&#x27;s Board of Governors, called for an improvement in French-language productions, but Premier Maurice Duplessis opposed it. In 1963, &quot;À l’heure de la décolonisation&quot;, directed by Monique Fortier, was the first NFB film directed by a French Canadian woman.

French-language media, including &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, criticized the NFB after it removed Roger Blais in 1957. NFB francophone directors Denys Arcand, Gilles Carle, Jacques Godbout, Gilles Groulx, and Clément Perron criticized the organization for its censorship policies, refusal to produce feature films, and its colonial treatment of Quebec. Michel Brault, Carle, Bernard Gosselin, Groulx, and Arthur Lamothe left following reprimands. Guy Roberge became the first French-Canadian to serve as the NFB&#x27;s commissioner. Duplessis died in 1959, and Quebec Liberal Party gained control while the Liberal Party won in the 1963 Canadian federal election. The Liberals supported a policy of bilingualism and biculturalism. A French-language branch of the NFB that was independent of its English-language productions was formed in 1964, under the leadership of Pierre Juneau.

&quot;Drylanders&quot;, the organization&#x27;s first English language feature-length fiction film, was released in 1963.

Kathleen Shannon organized Studio D, the first publicly funded feminist film-production unit in the world, in 1974, and produced 125 films before its closure in 1996. However, there would be no French version of Studio D until the formation of Studio B in 1986. The studio produced three Oscar winning films by 1984 (&quot;I&#x27;ll Find a Way&quot;, &quot;If You Love This Planet&quot;, and &quot;Flamenco at 5:15&quot;).

====Governmental financial involvement====

Starting in 1954, the Capital Cost Allowance was able to be used for a 60% tax write-off for film investment and the amount was increased to 100% in 1974. $1.2 billion was invested in Canadian film and television in the thirteen years following the increase. The average film budget rose from $527,000 to $2.6 million in 1979, and $3.5 million in 1986. From 1958 to 1967, private film investment accounted for 18% of film investments and it declined to 13.5% in 1968, while the CFDC accounted for 37.5%. Following the tax write-off increase private investment rose to account for 47% of film investment between 1975 and 1978 while the CFDC declined to 15%. &quot;Silence of the North&quot; was the first film with American backing to receive CCA certification. The Film and Video Production Tax Credit replaced the Capital Cost Allowance in 1995.

In 1962, Roberge proposed the creation of an organization to aid in film finance based on the National Film Finance Corporation and Centre national du cinéma et de l&#x27;image animée.

The Interdepartmental Committee on the Possible Development of a Feature Film Industry in Canada, under the leadership of NFB commissioner Roberge, was formed by the secretary of state. The committee submitted a report to the 19th Canadian Ministry for the creation of a loan fund to aid the development of the Canadian film industry. The proposal was approved in October 1965, and legislation, the Canadian Film Development Corporation Act of 1966–67, for its creation was introduced in June 1966, before being approved on 3 March 1967. The Canadian Film Development Corporation was established with a budget of $10 million in 1967. In February 1968, Spender was appointed as its director along with a five-member board. Canada lack of a film school leading to the creation of the Canadian Film Centre by Norman Jewison. The CFDC started investing up to 50% of its budget into films that cost less than $500,000.

&quot;Explosion&quot; was the first film to receive financial support from the CFDC. &quot;Valérie&quot; by Denis Héroux, which was not financially supported by the CFDC, was made at cost of $70,000 and made over $1 million in Quebec. The CFDC financially supported Héroux&#x27;s other films &quot;Here and Now (L&#x27;Initiation)&quot;, &quot;Love in a Four Letter World&quot;, &quot;Virgin Lovers&quot;, and &quot;Two Women in Gold (Deux Femmes en or)&quot;. Deux Femmes en or was financially successful, with its two million ticket sales remaining the highest in Canadian history, and became the highest grossing Canadian film.

The $10 million budget was used by October 1971, after the CFDC invested $6.7 million into 64 films with an average cost of $250,000 per film. The CFDC was not financially successful as only three of those films made a profit and the organization recovered $600,000 of its investments. After 1970 the CFDC focused on investing in smaller budgeted films and ended its work with American theatrical distributors to them hiding profits. Another $10 million budget was given to the CFDC in November 1971, and a new investment strategy in which $600,000 per year would be invested into productions, with its creative and technical crew being Canadian, budgeted below $100,000, and $3 million per year on films with guaranteed distribution. It took the CFDC five years to recover its first $1 million investment, but recovered $1 million in 1977 alone. From 1977 to 1978, the CFDC invested $1.6 million into twenty films and its investments rose to $10.8 million into 34 films from 1979 to 1980. Between 1968 and 1978, the organization funded 103 English-language films, but only &quot;Black Christmas&quot;, Death Weekend, &quot;Heart Farm&quot;, &quot;Shivers&quot;, and &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; were profitable to the CFDC.

The Toronto Filmmakers&#x27; Coop, an organization with 150 filmmakers, sent a letter with the endorsement of 200 filmmakers to Gérard Pelletier asking for the creation of a content quota that required distributors to have 15% of their films be Canadian. Pelletier announced the creation of a theatre in the National Capital Region that exclusively showed Canadian films in 1972. A study published by the Secretary of State reported that a content quota would not work as a 50% quote would generate less revenue than a 5% sales increase for foreign films. The study stated that new tax regulations and investments by the CFDC could make the Canadian film industry internationally competitive.

The budget for the CFDC was limited to a few million and its budget from 1982 to 1983 was $4.5 million. However, the organization had its role expanded to include television in 1983, and administered the Canadian Broadcast Program Development Fund. The television fund was initially given an annual budget of $60 million. An annual budget of $30 million through the Feature Film Fund was created in 1986, and an annual budget of $17 million through the Feature Film Distribution Fund was created in 1988. The organization&#x27;s combined budget grew to $146 million by 1989.

A report was written by a task force in 1985, and it stated that foreign domination of film and video distribution, chronic undercapitalization of production companies, and concentration of theatre ownership and distribution and exhibition vertical integration hurt the development of the film industry. They recommended legislation to increase the control of Canadian-owned companies over distribution and Minister of Communications Flora MacDonald proposed a film licensing system based on their recommendations. American distributors opposed the policy and lobbied the American government through the MPAA and its president, Jack Valenti. Valenti met with President Ronald Reagan at least twice and Reagan criticized the legislation of a US-Canadian economic summit. 54 members of the United States Congress signed a letter to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney opposing the legislation. The legislation was not tabled and it failed.

====Post-Carry on, Sergeant!====

F. R. Crawley, who was involved in filmmaking for a decade, and Judith Crawley created &quot;Île d&#x27;Orléans&quot; in 1938, and its success led to a $3,000 loan from F. R. Crawley&#x27;s father that created Crawley Films. It employment rose from 6 in 1946, 33 in 1949, and around 100 by the 1950s. One-sixth of the $3 million worth of films produced by the Canadian film industry in 1952 came from Crawley Films.

France Film and other companies started creating French film productions in the 1930s. &quot;Maria Chapdelaine&quot; is commonly, although incorrectly, regarded as the first French-Canadian sound movie. &quot;Étienne Brûlé gibier de potence&quot; was the first colour feature film made in Quebec and the first Canadian colour film shot in English and French. Joseph-Alexandre DeSève monopolized the distribution of French-language films through France-Film. France-Film arose from the distribution of &quot;Maria Chapdelaine&quot; which sold 70,000 tickets in Canada. He also aided in the production of &quot;Notre-Dame de la Mouise&quot; in response to the papal encyclical &quot;Vigilanti Cura&quot;. DeSève purchased Renaissance Films following the success of &quot;The Music Master&quot;. DeSève produced four films through Renaissance Films Distribution. Paul L&#x27;Anglais formed Quebec Productions filmed &quot;Whispering City&quot; in English and French, under the title &quot;La Forteresse&quot;. It was seen by over 100,000 people in Quebec over the course of six weeks.

The papal encyclical Vigilanti Cura in 1936, changed the Catholic attitude towards movies and the church became a part of Quebec movie production in the 1940s. Most of the nineteen movies, fifteen in French and four in English, produced in Quebec from 1944 to 1953 were made by Renaissance Films or Quebec Productions. Those were the only French-language feature films produced in Canada in that period.

&quot;Bush Pilot&quot; was the only English-language feature film created by a Canadian company in the 1940s.

====Modern industry====
&quot;Pour la suite du monde&quot; was the first Canadian film shown in competition at the Cannes Film Festival.

Canadians had to import colour 35 mm film until 1967, as Canada did not produce any internally.

By the 1960s Nat Taylor, a theatre owner, controlled the largest private film studio in Canada, Toronto International Film Studios, two distribution companies, International Film Distributors and Allied Artists Pictures, a television station, CJOH-DT, and multiple production companies. He entered film production with &quot;The Mask&quot; in 1961. Taylor, unlike other members of the AMPPLC, supported state involvement in feature film production.

Bryant Fryer founded one of the first animation companies in Canada and made six silhouette films from 1927 to 1935. Norman McLaren was brought to Canada from Scotland by Grierson in 1941. McLaren recruited English-Canadian animators from OCAD University, including George Dunning, Evelyn Lambart, Grant Munro, and Robert Verrall. McLaren recruited French-Canadian animators from École des beaux-arts de Montréal, including René Jodoin. Jodoin created a French animation unit in 1966, which included Laurent Coderre and Bernard Longpré. &quot;Le village enchanté&quot; was the first recorded animated feature film in Canadian history and &quot;Return to Oz&quot; which was based on &quot;Tales of the Wizard of Oz&quot;, the first recorded Canadian animated television series, was the second recorded animated feature film.

In the 1960s filmmakers came from universities throughout Canada. David Cronenberg, Clarke Mackey, and David Secter graduated from the University of Toronto. John Hofsess, Ivan Reitman, and Peter Rowe graduated from McMaster University. Jack Darcus and Larry Kent graduated from the University of British Columbia. Cronenberg received financial support from the CFDC and &quot;Shivers&quot; was their most successful investment, with a budget of $150,000 ($75,000 from the CFDC) and gross of $5 million. 708 feature films, over twice the amount made in the past fifty years, were made during the 1970s.

Carle, Groulx, Claude Jutra, and Jean Pierre Lefebvre, who were inspired by the French New Wave, made their directorial debuts from 1963 to 1965, and all won the Grand Prix at the Montreal International Film Festival throughout the 1960s. Jean-Claude Lauzon&#x27;s &quot;Night Zoo&quot; won the most Genie Awards in history, with thirteen awards.

&quot;Dream Life&quot; by Mireille Dansereau was the first privately produced feature film in Canada to be directed by a woman.

&quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; became the first Canadian film to gross more than $100 million. &quot;The Decline of the American Empire&quot; was the most successful Quebec film released in France with 1,236,322 viewers. &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, by Nelvana, was the highest-grossing non-Disney animated film at the time of its release. Six of the ten highest-grossing films in Canada between 1991 and 2001 were made in Quebec.

Film investment in British Columbia rose from $188.5 million in 1990 to over $1 billion in 1999. Feature film production rose from 16 films to 56 films, with the total number of productions rising from 50 to 192. From 2011 to 2021, film and television production British Columbia replaced Ontario as having the highest amount of spending. Spending rose from $1,578,000 to $3,254,000 in British Columbia, while Ontario rose from $2,586,000 to $3,166,000, and Quebec rose from $1,316,000 to $2,098,000.

Women accounted for 17% of directors, 22% of writers, and 12% of cinematographers for projects backed by Telefilm between 2013 and 2014. In 2016, programs were instituted at Telefilm to increase the number of projects led by women. The percentage of films supported by Telefilm that were directed or written by women rose to 44% and 46% by 2017.

In 2023, the total production volume of film and television production in Canada fell to below the numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild of America strikes.

Quebec amended its film tax credit laws in 2024, in which a cap of 65% of a contract&#x27;s value was implemented. Visual effects and animation employees protested the change, but François Legault&#x27;s government stated that it was necessary to reduce costs due to the tax credit investment rising from $226 million in 2018, to $440 million in 2024.

===Theatres===

In the 1890s and 1900s films were shown by travelling showmen. John C. Green, a magician who presented for the Holland brothers at their first showing, travelled throughout eastern Canada and New England until the establishment of movie theatres. John Albert Schuberg was credited with bringing movies to Vancouver and Winnipeg, and the provinces of British Columbia and the Canadian Prairies. Schuberg established Canada&#x27;s first permanent movie theatre, the Electric Theatre, in Vancouver, in October 1902, with its first movie played being &quot;The Eruption of Mount Pelee&quot;. He opened additional theatres in Winnipeg, and later gained the license for First National Pictures in western Canada. He had one of the largest theatre chains and sold it to Jay and Jules Allen for around $1 million in 1919, before returning in 1921, and then selling it to Famous Players in 1924.

Jay and Jules Allen established their first theatre in Brantford in 1906. The established Allen Amusement Corporation, a film exchange, in 1908. Their chain was worth over $20 million by 1920, and had fifty-three theatres by 1923, when they declared bankruptcy and it was acquired by Famous Players. The Allens owned the distribution rights for Pathé and Paramount Pictures. In 1916, they rejected an offer by Paramount president Adolph Zukor to create an equal partnership. The Allens informed Nathan Nathanson of this attempt and Nathanson convinced Zukor to give him their distribution rights in 1920, for twenty years after creating his own theatre chain.

Nathanson&#x27;s Famous Players started an expansion campaign in the 1920s that led to its gaining control of all first run theatres in the major cities. Zukor and Paramount forced Nathanson out of Famous Players after buying a large amount of the stock in 1930. Famous Players also controlled the distribution industry in Canada, accounting for at least 40% of distribution, due to its connections to Paramount Pictures. Paul Nathanson managed Regal Films, which was controlled by Paramount, and distributed films from British International Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Pathé, and Famous Players also distributed films from Columbia Pictures. Fox Film, RKO Pictures, Tiffany Pictures, and Warner Bros. were the other main distributors in Canada in the 1930s. A study conducted by United Artists in 1931 showed that 67% of rental revenue in Canada came from nineteen theatres in Canada&#x27;s main cities while the remainder came from the rest.

Block booking by major studios, that were from outside Canada, prevented independent theatre owners from obtaining films at a reasonable price. R. B. Bennett, who invested into the film industry, made investigating the film industry an issue in the 1930 election. Peter White was appointed to investigate Famous Players&#x27; monopolistic control of theatres under the Combines Investigation Act. White concluded that &quot;a combine exists and has existed at least since the year of 1926&quot; and Famous Players was detrimental to the public interest in 1931, but no action was taken against the company. Bennett supported taking action and the attorney generals of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan would prosecute Famous Players. Fifteen companies and three people, including Nathan Nathanson, were charged, but the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favor of the companies.

After losing control over Famous Players Nathanson created Odeon Theatres in April 1941, and resigned from his position at Famous Players in May. He built the company using Regal Films, which was managed by his brother and distributed MGM films, and gaining the business of companies whose contracts with Famous Players were expiring. Odeon did not gain a MGM distribution contract, but did gain ones for all of Columbia Pictures&#x27; films, two-thirds of Universal&#x27;s films, and one-third of Fox&#x27;s films. Nathanson died in 1943, and was succeeded by his son Paul. Films released in Famous Players and Odeon theatres, both foreign owned after Paul sold his stock to J. Arthur Rank in 1946, accounted for over 60% of the Canadian box office by 1947. 

Taylor, who declined to become the general manager of Odeon in 1941, founded Twentieth Century Theatres in the 1930s and the Famous Players-aligned company grew to own sixty-five theatres by the 1960s. He opened the International Theatre in Toronto which was the first theatre in Canada dedicated towards screening art films. Taylor and Garth Drabinsky created the Cineplex Odeon Corporation in 1979, and by 1987 it was the largest theatre chain in North America with 1,500 theatres, with two-thirds of them in the United States.

The deaths of seventy-eight children from the Laurier Palace Theatre fire in 1927, and opposition to film from the Catholic Church led to a ban on minors attending movie theatres until 1961. In the 1930s Quebec was the only province that allowed for theatres to be open on Sundays. The Quebec Cinema Act, passed in 1983, required that English-language films in Quebec must be translated into French within sixty days. However, films from the United States were unaffected as their distribution ended before the deadline and the NFB was exempted from the requirements.

The Canadian box office increased following World War II. In 1934 there were 796 theatres which admitted 107 million people to earn $25 million, and that grew to 1,229 theatres admitting 151 million people to make $37 million in 1940. By 1950 the number of theatres increased to 2,360, earning $86 million with 245 million people attending. However, during the 1950s Canadian film attendance declined, with the nation falling from the fifth-highest in film attendance to twenty-fifth by the 1960s, and the number of films the average Canadian saw per year dropped from seventeen in 1950 to eight in 1960. Ticket sales in Quebec fell from 60 million in 1952 to 19 million in 1969. The number of theatres in Canada declined from 1,635 in 1962 to 1,400 in 1967, then to 1,116 in 1974, and to 899 in 1984. 

===International===
Many native-born Canadians, such as Al Christie, Allan Dwan, Louis B. Mayer, Sidney Olcott, Mack Sennett, and Jack L. Warner, aided in the creation and development of the American film industry.

In the early 1900s Canada was used as a shooting location for dramatic productions, with &quot;Hiawatha, the Messiah of the Ojibway&quot; being one of the first in 1903. The Kalem Company was one of the first American companies to conduct location shooting in Canada in 1909. Two of the films D. W. Griffith made in his first year as a director, &quot;The Ingrate&quot; and &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Way&quot;, were made in Canada. British American Film Company, Canadian Bioscope Company, Conness Till Film Company of Toronto, and the All-Red Feature Company, the four Canadians companies that produced fictional films prior to World War I, had their investment come from Americans, but all of them were financially unsuccessful and closed within a few years, with Conness Till suffering a fire that destroyed their $50,000 studio.

Canadians were hostile to American filmmakers, and provincial film review boards instituted censorship policies in 1915, which included a ban on the gratuitous display of the flag of the United States. Fifty reels of film were banned in British Columbia in 1914 due to &quot;an unnecessary display of U.S. flags&quot;, which put it as the third most common reason behind infidelity and seduction. In 1927, the United Kingdom created a quota limiting the number of foreign films that could be shown in the country, but productions that were produced within the British Empire and mostly made by British subjects were excluded from the quotas. American financers produced low-budget B movies within Canada to exploit the loophole before the legislation was changed in 1938 to exclude the Dominion. &quot;Nanook of the North&quot; and &quot;The Viking&quot; exploited the loophole. From 1928 to 1938 twenty-two feature films, the majority of Canada&#x27;s film production, meant solely for the British market, were filmed.

American companies made $17 million in profits from Canada in 1947. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s government sought to reduce the general trade imbalance between Canada and the United States. McLean called for the reinvestment of this money into Canadian film production and requiring the American distribution of Canadian shorts. The Motion Picture Association of America proposed the Canadian Cooperation Project and it was accepted by the Canadian government on 14 January 1948. The government would not restrict revenue to American companies in exchange for productions being filmed in Canada and mentions of Canada in those scripts to promote tourism. The project was considered unsuccessful and stifled Canadian filmmaking, with only eight Canadian feature films being made during the CCP&#x27;s existence, before it ended in 1958. McLean was critical of the agreement as there was a lack of Canadian films distributed in the United States. Michael Spencer stated that the agreement was &quot;allowed to die of embarrassment&quot;.

Gilbert Agar attended the Fourth National Motion Picture Conference of the Motion Picture Council in America in 1926, and reported that 95% of films released in Canada were from the United States. Eric Johnston stated that &quot;outside the U.S. itself, Canada ranks as the second largest market in the world for Hollywood films.&quot; The number of films in Canada of American origin declined to 68% by 1954, and 41% in 1962.

Canadian directors, such as Norman Jewison, left Canada to work in the United States. Raoul Barré worked as a cartoonist in Canada before moving to the United States and working as an animator at Barré Studio. Stephen Bosustow and other animators left Walt Disney Animation Studios during the Disney animators&#x27; strike and founded United Productions of America.

Seven Arts Productions, while being listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and having a majority of its investors be Canadians, had the majority of its productions done by its American subsidiary. It spent $25 million on ten American film productions, including &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot;. Canadian 3D animation companies, such as Softimage and Alias Research, had their software used for American films, such as Jurassic Park.

==Reception==
Productions from the NFB received 64 Academy Award nominations and ten victories by 2000. The Crawleys produced 2,500 films and won over 200 awards during their careers, including the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film for &quot;The Man Who Skied Down Everest&quot;.

&quot;Churchill&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;If You Love This Planet&quot;, and &quot;Neighbours&quot; were awarded the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Film. &quot;The Sand Castle&quot;, &quot;Special Delivery&quot;, and &quot;Every Child&quot; were awarded the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. &quot;I&#x27;ll Find a Way&quot; was awarded the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.

David Bairstow&#x27;s &quot;Royal Journey&quot; won the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary in 1952.

Colin Low&#x27;s &quot;The Romance of Transportation in Canada&quot; was awarded the Prix du Film d&#x27;Animation at the Cannes Film Festival in 1953. Brault won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director for &quot;Orders&quot;. 

==Censorship and preservation==
===Censorship===

In 1906, Paul Bruchési voiced opposition to showing films on Sunday, as they were a commercial activity in violation of the Sabbath. Montreal banned Sunday screenings in 1908, but film companies successfully sued against the law.

Ouimet&#x27;s fine of $10 in February 1908, for having the Ouimetoscope open on Sundays was a test case to establish the power to close places of amusement on Sundays. In 1920, Pierre-François Casgrain opposed an attempt to remove a 15¢ per reel per day tax on film exhibitors, stating that &quot;Pictures that are shown are an invitation to the people of the poorer classes to revolt, and they bring disorder into the country&quot;. Fees implemented by the censorship boards earned the government large amounts of money with Alberta&#x27;s two censorship boards making $12,275 in 1927. By 1921, New Brunswick had the lowest fee at $0.50 per reel while Ontario had the highest at $3 per reel, $1 per reel license for each copy. Appeals cost $5 in Quebec and $10 in Ontario. &quot;Variety&quot; reported in 1950 that censorship fees were costing the film industry over $1,450,000 per year, with $600,000 of the expense coming from Canada.

Censorship boards were established in Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec in 1911, in Alberta and British Columbia in 1913, and in Nova Scotia in 1915. 5,500 reels of film were censored in the United Kingdom in 1925, compared to 6,639 reels in Quebec, 5,518 reels in Manitoba, and 5,013 reels in Alberta. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; reported that the number of films banned in Canada fell from one hundred one in 1932 to nineteen in 1940, with nine being banned in Quebec and none in Ontario. Three hundred of the six hundred films examined by censors in 1940 were censored. Quebec censors rejected all films the dealt with divorce. Multiple Russian films were banned due to &quot;suspected Communist propaganda&quot;, and during World War II all foreign films, with the exception of France, were banned.

Ontario banned all war films in 1914. The Canadian Militia initially ordered censorship boards in very province to condemn war films, but later created its own war films by 1915. In 1950, &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; was banned in Nova Scotia as there was a military recruitment drive happening.

&quot;Damaged Goods&quot;, a film about sexually transmitted infection, was banned in Ontario in 1916. Mutual Film screened the film to a selected audience—as a private showing it was exempt from the provincial censorship laws—and asked them if the film should be released. The audience approved of the film, and Mutual Film appealed the ruling, but were unsuccessful. To combat the spread of sexual diseases a government campaign was initiated in the late 1910s. The Canadian National Council for Combating Venereal Disease, which was led by William Renwick Riddell and Gordon Bates, sought to distribute &quot;The End of the Road&quot; in Ontario in 1919. The censorship board was conflicted over maintaining its earlier ruling or allowing a government campaign to continue. The board rejected the film, and the ruling was maintained on appeal. However, the ruling was reversed in 1920, and over 20,000 people saw the film within five days of its release and 40,000 by 1932. Other films about sexual diseases were allowed to be shown as well.

Censors were criticized starting in the 1950s for their abuse of power. Minister of Finance Hepburn banned all of &quot;The March of Time&quot; newsreels in 1942, without the board watching it, due to a &quot;Time&quot; article about him that he did not like. J. Bernard Hughes, the chief censor in British Columbia, banned &quot;Diary of a Nazi&quot; stating that it was &quot;purely Russian propaganda&quot; that depicted &quot;the Nazis at their worst&quot;. Ernest Manning believed that the film industry in the United States was dominated by communists and sought to ban multiple films including Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;The House I Live In&quot;. Duplessis banned showing NFB films in Quebec schools in 1952. The advent of television made it difficult for censors, as they could not control the content being broadcast to Canada from the United States and had limited control over internal television broadcasts, with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation showing films that were banned in provinces in those provinces. Henry McLeod, a censor from Nova Scotia, stated that &quot;What&#x27;s the point of banning a film when the trade can turn around and sell it to the CBC?&quot;.

The Canadian Federation of Film Societies, an organization with 25,000 members, called for the replacement of censorship boards with a rating system. In 1961, George Enos, who served as New Brunswick&#x27;s censor for thirty years, stated that censorship &quot;is very undesirable&quot; and that &quot;Ninety percent of the worry is needless. Respectable people will condemn a bad picture. I don&#x27;t like the idea of setting up one man to say what his neighbour shall see or not see. He would have to be a superman.&quot; By the 1960s the Quebec censorship board was one of the largest with eighteen full-time staff employed compared to other provincial boards which had two to five full-time staff. By the 1970s the censorship boards were being transitioned to classification boards, with the companies having to recut their films rather than the boards.

The Hicklin test was used as the standard for film censorship until 1959, when the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; was amended, and the Supreme Court of Canada overruled a ruling by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal that held that the Hicklin test was still in effect. &quot;The Columbus of Sex&quot; by John Hofsess was the first film in Canada charged with obscenity. The film was ordered to be destroyed following the trial, but the film&#x27;s producers, Reitman and Daniel Goldberg, sold the rights to an American company that recut the film into &quot;My Secret Life&quot;.

&quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; was banned in Nova Scotia in 1974. Gerard McNeil, the editor of the Dartmouth Free Press, opposed the film&#x27;s censorship and he filed a lawsuit in which he argued that the censors were acting illegally when they banned the film, that citizens have a right to view uncensored films regardless of their content, and that the taxes and fees collected by the Amusements Board was to continue its illegal activities. The censors argued that McNeil had no standing to sue as he had no direct interest in the case, but the Nova Scotia Supreme Court stated that &quot;there could be a large number of persons with a valid desire to challenge&quot;. The court ruled on 2 February 1976 that the provinces had no power to censor films under the British North America Acts. However, the Supreme Court of Canada overruled the court on 19 January 1978, in a five to four decision.

===Preservation===
In 1924, the majority of Ouimet&#x27;s Specialty Film Import&#x27;s collection was destroyed by fire.

The University of Alberta created a film library in 1917, and Quebec was the first province to utilize film in schools. The rights to &quot;Carry on, Sergeant!&quot; were acquired by the National Film Archive of Canada and reconstructed the film with Gordon Sparling, who worked on it as an assistant director, to show on television in 1968. The Canadian Film Archives was formed by the NFB in 1951.

The NFB accumulated around 80 million feet of film in an air force hangar by 1953, but no funding was given for its proper storage by the National Film Act. A nitrate vault that could contain up to 1,000 cans of 35 mm film, worth one million feet, was planned. A successful test fire using 1.25 million feet of scrapped newsreel film was done in June 1952. The rising costs for the construction of the NFB&#x27;s headquarters in Montreal resulted in the Department of Public Works cancelling the construction of film vaults. 13.1 million metres of archival footage worth $4.8 million () was instead stored in Kirkland, Quebec, and were destroyed in a fire in July 1967. Federal funding for film preservation was adopted in 1969, and the National Film Archives was created in 1973.

It borders Selangor on the north, Pahang in the east, and Malacca and Johor to the south.

Negeri Sembilan has diverse tropical rainforests and an equatorial climate. The state&#x27;s mountain ranges belong to the Titiwangsa Mountains, a southern subrange of the Tenasserim Hills that span throughout southern Myanmar, southern Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, with Mount Besar Hantu as the highest point. The Titiwangsa also ends here, at Mount Tampin, located south of the state.

The capital of Negeri Sembilan is Seremban. The royal capital is Seri Menanti in Kuala Pilah District. Other important towns are Port Dickson (town), Bahau and Nilai.

The economy of Negeri Sembilan is mainly based on agriculture, manufacturing and services. Seremban and Port Dickson Districts are the state&#x27;s major economic hubs, both constituting the Malaysia Vision Valley corridor.

The name is believed to derive from the nine (&quot;sembilan&quot;) villages or &quot;nagari&quot; in the Minangkabau language (now known as &quot;luak&quot;) settled by the Minangkabau (or &quot;Menangkabau&quot;), a people originally from West Sumatra (in present-day Indonesia). Minangkabau features are still visible today in traditional architecture and the dialect of Malay spoken.

Unlike the hereditary monarchs of the other royal Malay states, the ruler of Negeri Sembilan is elected and is known as &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Besar&quot; instead of Sultan. He is elected by the council of &quot;Undangs&quot; who lead the four largest territories of Sungai Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, from the legitimate male members of the Pagaruyung dynasty, with the surviving sons of the previous Yamtuan coming first in the considerations but not being obligatory to be voted on, making it one of the more democratic monarchies. Negeri Sembilan is also the only state in Malaysia that is a coregency, where the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Besar&quot;, the four &quot;Undangs&quot; and the &quot;Tunku Besar&quot; of Tampin together share the power as rulers of the state.

The Arabic honorific title of the state is Darul Khusus (دار الخصوص; &quot;The Special Abode&quot;).

== Etymology==

The name of Negeri Sembilan literally translates to &quot;State (of the) Nine&quot;. It is believed to have been derived from the nine chiefdoms settled by the Minangkabau, known as &quot;Nogoghi&quot; in the Negeri Sembilan dialect, also known as &quot;luak&quot; (Minangkabau: &quot;luak&quot;, &quot;luhak&quot;). The size of modern Negeri Sembilan is smaller than its historical extent.
==History==
===Ancient and medieval history===
The earliest possible human settlement in Negeri Sembilan can be traced back around 14,000 years to the Pasoh Caves, a complex of karst caves near Simpang Pertang in the Jelebu district. Artefacts found around the caves include stone tools and food remains, estimated to date from 12,000 BCE based on carbon dating. The early inhabitants of Negeri Sembilan were the ancestors of the Semelai, Semai, Semang, and Jakun peoples, who lived either as hunter-gatherer nomads or as subsistence farmers.

According to the &quot;Malay Annals&quot;, Parameswara reportedly visited the settlement of &quot;Sening Ujong&quot;, which was located in what is now Seremban.

The Minangkabaus from Sumatra settled in what is today Negeri Sembilan in the 15th century, under the protection of the Malacca Sultanate and later the Sultanate of Johor. They also brought their matrilineal custom, known as &quot;Adat Perpatih&quot;, which became the local custom.

The Linggi River along the western part of the state, and the Muar River were used as major trade routes since the time of the Malacca Sultanate. The former linked the tin-rich area of Sungai Ujong to the port city of Malacca; while the latter, along with the Pahang River via the Serting River in walking distance to the east, formed part of the Laluan Penarikan (lit. &#x27;portage route&#x27; in Malay), facilitating access between the Strait of Malacca and the South China Sea.

As Johor weakened in the 18th century, attacks by the Bugis forced the Minangkabaus to seek protection from their homeland. The Minangkabau ruler, Sultan Abdul Jalil, obliged by sending his near relative, Raja Mahmud, also known as Raja Melewar.

When Raja Melewar arrived, he found that another royal, Raja Khatib had already established himself as ruler. He declared war against Raja Khatib and became the ruler of Negeri Sembilan. The Sultan of Johor confirmed his position by granting the title Yamtuan Seri Menanti (&quot;He Who is Highest Lord of the Seri Menanti&quot;) in 1773.

=== Nine chiefdoms ===
At the time of its establishment, Negeri Sembilan was originally a loose confederation of nine chiefdoms (&quot;luaks&quot;), hence the name. During Raja Melewar&#x27;s rule, it covered a larger area than its modern-day boundaries. In addition to the entire modern-day Negeri Sembilan, it also encompassed parts of what are now Selangor, Malacca, Pahang and Johor.

The original nine chiefdoms or domains that made up the first incarnation of Negeri Sembilan in 1773, and gave the state its name, were:

# Sungai Ujong
# Jelebu
# Rembau
# Johol
# Jelai
# Ulu Pahang
# Naning
# Segamat
# Klang

Historically, all &quot;luak&quot; concentrically revolved around Seri Menanti as a center flanked by four inner &quot;luak serambi&quot; and four outer &quot;luak&quot; akin to a &quot;mandala&quot;. Ulu Pahang, Naning, Segamat and Klang were annexed into neighbouring states in the 19th century; Naning was incorporated into the Straits Settlement of Malacca in 1832 following the Naning War.

Ulu Pahang became the Bera region of Pahang, Segamat was annexed by Johor, and Klang became part of the Kuala Langat region of Selangor.

After Raja Melewar&#x27;s death in 1795, a series of disputes arose over the succession. For a considerable period, the local nobles appealed to the Minangkabau ruler in Sumatra for a new ruler. However, competing interests supported different candidates, often resulting in further instability and civil war.

===Colonial history===


In 1874, the British intervened militarily in a leadership tussle in Sungai Ujong to preserve British economic interests and placed the domain under the control of a British Resident. Jelebu followed in 1883 and Rembau in 1887. Their presence was detested by the locals, which eventually paved the way to a deadly civil war and subsequent breakup.

====Battle of Paroi====
In 1875, British forces, accompanied by Arab mercenaries and Gurkha, engaged Malay defenders in Paroi at the Battle of Paroi. Despite initial setbacks, the British ultimately prevailed, capturing the Malay stronghold. Casualties were heavy on both sides, with the British and Arab contingents suffering 37 killed and wounded, while the Malay had around 35 deaths and many wounded.

====Battle of Bukit Putus====
After the Battle of Paroi, the British waited for Gurkha reinforcements, which arrived on 10 December 1875. The Malays fortified Bukit Putus, a mountain pass on the boundary between Sungai Ujong and Terachi. The British attacked Bukit Putus from both the front and back. The Gurkhas successfully captured the Malay stockade at Bukit Putus. The Malays retreated after the surprise appearance of Sungai Ujong Resident P.J. Murray&#x27;s forces from behind. The inhabitants of the Terachi Valley fled, villages were burned, and Yamtuan Antah&#x27;s palace in Seri Menanti was destroyed.

====Seri Menanti Confederation, modern Negeri Sembilan and statehood====
The formation of modern Negeri Sembilan began in 1889, when the Seri Menanti domain, under the rule of Tuanku Muhammad (son of Yamtuan Antah), combined with the domains of Tampin and Rembau, forming the &quot;Seri Menanti Confederation&quot; as a single political entity.

The domains of Sungai Ujong and Jelebu joined this confederation in 1895, forming the state of Negeri Sembilan in its modern borders. Martin Lister became the new state&#x27;s first Resident, and Negeri Sembilan became part of the Federated Malay States the same year.

===Modern history===
In the first half of the 20th century, rural Negeri Sembilan saw large deforestation due to demand for natural rubber (&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot;); 6,188 plantations were counted in 1903 and were 396,065 counted in 1939. It was occupied by the Japanese in World War II between 1942 and 1945, joined the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and became a state of Malaysia in 1963.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Seremban and Nilai attracted people who migrated from the overcrowded towns of the Klang Valley. These two cities also became home to new factories and industrial parks, contributing to the state&#x27;s modern development.

On 9 September 2009, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government approved the state capital of Seremban&#x27;s application to become a city (Bandar Raya), as it had experienced significant population growth. To make this possible, its city council had to be merged with the Nilai Municipal Council. After several postponements, Seremban officially attained city status on 20 January 2020.

Later that same year on 9 November, Negeri Sembilan was placed under the Movement Control Order lockdown due to increasing COVID-19 infections.

==Geography==
Facing the Strait of Malacca, Negeri Sembilan is one of the West Coast states of Peninsular Malaysia. It is specifically part of the southern region, along with Malacca and Johor. However, some sources define Negeri Sembilan as a central region state with Selangor and the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya.

The state is slightly smaller than Selangor, with a total land area of 6,686 km² (430 sq mi). It is the fourth smallest state in Malaysia by area and the second largest in the southern region behind Johor. Its shape is roughly pentagonal.

=== Topography ===
Topographically, Negeri Sembilan consists of two plains divided by a mountainous spine in the middle. This region is well drained by various rivers on both sides. The Titiwangsa Mountains, the southernmost extension of the Tenasserim Hills and the wider Indo-Malayan Cordillera, spans approximately 92 km (57.1 mi) through the middle of the state. The mountain range starts from the border tripoint with Pahang and Selangor near Kenaboi, Jelebu, and extends towards Tampin, close to the border with Malacca.

This geographical feature results in the state being bisected almost diagonally into two regions; western Negeri Sembilan, consisting of the Port Dickson, Seremban, and Rembau Districts; and eastern Negeri Sembilan, which includes the districts of Jelebu, Kuala Pilah, Jempol, and Tampin. The western half is more developed and has an intricate and concentrated road network compared to the latter, which is predominantly rural.

The Negeri Sembilan section of the Titiwangsa Mountains forms a division for four river basins. The Langat and Linggi Rivers flows through the western half, while the Muar and Pahang Rivers constitute the eastern side. The Linggi and Muar rivers are the two major rivers flowing through the state and serve as significant water sources for the population. Its rainforests form part of the Titiwangsa Forest Complex, a component of the Central Forest Spine conservation area that covers much of the heavily forested and mountainous interior of Peninsular Malaysia.

==== Highest point ====
Mount Besar Hantu, at 1,462 m (4,797 ft), located in Jelebu District and close to the border with Pahang, is the highest point in Negeri Sembilan. The nearby Mount Nuang, which is 31 metres taller, marks the tripoint with Selangor and Pahang at its northernmost point, of which it is the third tallest in the former; while in the south, Mount Ledang, an isolated mountain, marks the tripoint with Malacca and Johor, where it is the highest point of the latter at 1,276 m (4,186.3 ft).

=== Districts ===

On the administrative level, Negeri Sembilan consists of seven districts, namely the Port Dickson, Seremban, Rembau, Kuala Pilah, Jelebu, Jempol and Tampin Districts.

The state is also has 14 &quot;luaks&quot; which are: Sungai Ujong, Rembau, Jelebu, Johol, Tampin, Ulu Muar, Terachi, Ineh, Jempol, Gunung Pasir, Gemencheh, Pasir Besar, Ayer Kuning, and Linggi.

Sungai Ujong, Rembau, Johol and Jelebu are governed by the &quot;Undangs&quot;, thus they are known as the &quot;Luak Berundang&quot;. In addition, there are four &quot;luaks&quot; that are protected under two of the &quot;Luak Berundang&quot;, which are Gemencheh, Ayer Kuning and Pasir Besar, which are protectorates of Johol; as well as Linggi, a protectorate of Sungai Ujong.

The &quot;luaks&quot; surrounding Seri Menanti such as Terachi, Ulu Muar, Jempol, Gunung Pasir and Ineh are collectively known as the &quot;Luak Tanah Mengandung&quot;.

Lastly, the Luak of Tampin, also known as the &quot;Adat&quot; Territory of Tampin (Malay: &quot;Wilayah Adat Tampin&quot;), holds a semi-autonomous status and is ruled by the Tunku Besar.

===Climate===
Negeri Sembilan experiences equatorial climate (Köppen climate classification: Af), which is hot and humid all year round. Thunderstorms are mostly prevalent during the period of monsoonal transitions that occur twice a year.

Dry seasons usually starts shortly after the first monsoonal transition and lasts until August to September, as the moisture brought by the southwesterly Indo-Australian Monsoon are blocked by the Barisan Mountains in Sumatera, creating a rainshadow effect on the eastern coast of the island and the Malay Peninsula.

In the corresponding Borneo-Australian Monsoon that blows from the northeast, Negeri Sembilan, along with the states of Melaka, Johor, and the East Coast states of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang are the most affected by the monsoonal surge that brings persistently heavy rainfall and cause rough sea conditions in the South China Sea.
==Government==

===Constitution===
The Constitution of Negeri Sembilan came into force on 26 March 1959. It is divided into two sections. The constitution establishes that the state&#x27;s form of government is constitutional monarchy and the world&#x27;s only elective monarchy for a matrilineal society. The system was partially the basis for the federal monarchy.

===The Ruler===

The current Yang di-Pertuan Besar is Muhriz of Negeri Sembilan. He succeeded Ja&#x27;afar of Negeri Sembilan who died on 27 December 2008.

Unlike Malaysia&#x27;s eight other Royal Malay states, the Ruler of Negeri Sembilan is elected to his office by the territorial chiefs or Ruling Chiefs of the state. These Ruling Chiefs are titled Undang. Only four of the Undangs have the right to vote in the election for the Ruler of the State. They are:

* The Undang of Sungai Ujong
* The Undang of Jelebu
* The Undang of Johol
* The Undang of Rembau

The Undang themselves cannot stand for election, and their choice of Ruler is limited to a male Muslim who is Malay and also a &quot;lawfully begotten descendant of Raja Radin ibni Raja Lenggang&quot;.

The Assembly convenes at the Wisma Negeri in the state capital, Seremban.

=== Executive and Legislature ===


The State Executive Council consists of the Menteri Besar (Chief Minister), who is its chairman, and ten other members. The Menteri Besar and the other members of the council are appointed by the Yang Di-Pertuan Besar from the members of the State Assembly of the governing party or coalition. The current Menteri Besar of the state is Aminuddin Harun.

Nestlé&#x27;s Chembong plant is also the largest Milo manufacturer in the world, as well as the company&#x27;s largest global centre of excellence.

Negeri Sembilan is mainly an agricultural state. However, the establishment of several industrial estates enhanced the manufacturing sector as a significant contributor to the state economy. Two districts in the western half of the state – Seremban and Port Dickson – have been gazetted as part of the Malaysia Vision Valley, a new growth corridor conceived from the joint venture between Sime Darby and both the federal and state governments in 2015 as part of the National Transformation Agenda, the National Physical Plan, the Eleventh Malaysia Plan and the 2045 Negeri Sembilan Structural Plan, in order to evenly balancing the existing development in the neighbouring Klang Valley area, providing ample space for the southern extension of the Greater Kuala Lumpur area, as well as to transform Negeri Sembilan into a developed state by 2045. As of 2024, the MVV is now in its second iteration, and is still undergoing development. Meanwhile, districts east of the MVV – Rembau, Kuala Pilah, Tampin and Jempol – are yet to be developed into an agropolis, to boost foodstuff production in the state and national levels respectively.

The agricultural activity includes rubber and oil palm plantations, livestock, fruit orchards and vegetable farming. About 3,099 square kilometres are used for rubber and oil palm plantations.

==Culture==


The Minangkabau people brought with them a cultural heritage which is still preserved and practised today as the &quot;adat perpatih&quot;, a matrilineal system of inheritance and administration that is unique to the state, where the husband is the head of the household and inheritance passes from mother to daughter. The Minangkabaus in Negeri Sembilan are divided into twelve &quot;suku&quot; (clans). Each of these &quot;suku&quot; is led by a chief, known as the &quot;Lembaga&quot;. Each &quot;suku&quot; is broken down into subunits known as the &quot;Perut&quot;, where each of them are led by a chief, either known as a &quot;Buapak&quot; (male) or &quot;Ibu Soko&quot; (female). Both the &quot;Buapak&quot; and &quot;Ibu Soko&quot; play a vital role as people to refer to regarding the &quot;adat&quot; and religious matters among the subordinates of the &quot;Perut&quot;, known as &quot;Anak Buah&quot;. Marriage between members of the same clan is forbidden. The twelve &quot;suku&quot; are known as the following, of which the names of each &quot;suku&quot; indicates their area of origin:
* Biduanda () 
* Seri Lemak () 
* Seri Melenggang ()
* Anak Aceh 
* Anak Melaka ()
* Tiga Nenek ()
* Tiga Batu ()
* Tanah Datar
* Batu Hampar ()
* Payakumbuh ()
* Batu Belang ()
* Mungkal ()

The Minangkabau influence in the state can be found in dances and food as well.

===Performing arts===
Negeri Sembilan also has traditional music like the Caklempong, Dikir Rebana, Tumbuk Kalang, and Bongai.

The musical instruments used to bear some semblance to Sumatra, the ancestral home of the Minangkabau people. Dances like the tarian lilin (candle dance) and rentak kuda (the beat of the horse) are popular in Negeri Sembilan and the coordinated movements of the dancers in their colorful costumes in the Tarian Piring and the upbeat tempo of Tarian Randai. Each beat, rhythm and movement in these dances combines to form a story, maybe of a bygone myth or simply a reflection of the lifestyles of another era.

They are usually performed at traditional festivities, cultural events and dinner-cum-cultural shows.

<text>The little swift (Apus affinis), is a small species of swift found in Africa and southwestern Asia, and are vagrants and local breeders in southern Europe. They are found both in urban areas and at rocky cliffs where they build nests in a way typical of all members of the order Apodiformes. The genus name &quot;Apus&quot; is Latin for a swift, thought by the ancients to be a type of swallow without feet (from Ancient Greek α, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;without&quot;, and πούς, &quot;pous&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;). The Latin specific &quot;affinis&quot; means similar to or related to, but in this case the species that the little swift supposedly resembles is not clear from the description. A population formerly considered to be an eastern subspecies of little swift is now separated as a distinct species, the house swift (&quot;Apus nipalensis&quot;).

==Description==
Little swifts are readily identified by their small size. Their wingspan is only 33 cm compared to 42 cm in the case of common swift. Their plumage is black except for a white throat and rump, the white rump patch extending onto the flanks. They have a short square tail, with all rectrices round-tipped. The flight is fluttering like that of a house martin, and the call is a high twittering. Like other swifts they are very short-legged. The legs are used for clinging to vertical surfaces only.

==Habits and foraging==
Little swifts spend most of their lives in the air, living on the insects they catch in their beaks. They drink on the wing, but roost on vertical cliffs or walls. They never settle voluntarily on the ground.

==Movements==
Unlike the more northerly common swift, many birds are resident, but some populations are migratory, and these winter further south than their breeding areas. They wander widely on migration, and are seen as rare vagrants in much of Europe and Asia.

==Breeding==
Little swifts breed around habitation and cliffs from southern Spain, Africa northeastwards through southern Pakistan and India and Sri Lanka. They build their nests in holes in buildings or sometimes on cliffs, laying 1–4 eggs. A little swift will return to the same site year after year, rebuilding its nest when necessary. A species of bedbug &quot;Cimex hemipterus&quot; has been recorded from its nest in India.

== Status ==
This species has a wide distribution and its population is increasing, and as a result is classified as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

The population of the species is expanding and increasing, mainly due to its tendency to build nests in man-made structures. However, in Turkey a local decline of about 50% was observed due to habitat loss resulting from dam construction.

<text>The house swift (Apus nipalensis) is a species of swift in the family Apodidae. It is found in Japan, Nepal, and Southeast Asia. It is capable of flying long distances by alternately shutting off hemispheres of its brain in-flight.

It was formerly considered a subspecies of the little swift, under the name &quot;Apus affinis subfurcatus.&quot;

== Description ==
The house swift looks quite similar to the little swift. It is a small bird, but a medium-sized swift, with a wingspan of 12.5-14.5 cm. Its body size ranges from 14 to 16 cm and weighs approximately 20-35 g. This species has a dark, slightly forked tail. Other than the white rump band and white throat-patch, the house swift has a black plumage, darker than the little swift.

== Taxonomy ==
The name &quot;Apus nipalensis&quot; has two parts. &quot;Apus&quot; is the genus for swifts, and comes from the Latin word for the swift, or swallow with no feet. &quot;Nipalensis&quot; means from Nepal.

Currently, there are four subspecies of the house swift: &quot;Apus nipalensis nipalensis&quot;, &quot;Apus nipalensis subfurcatus&quot;, &quot;Apus nipalensis furcatus&quot;, and &quot;Apus nipalensis kuntzi&quot;.

== Habitat and distribution ==
The house swift is highly aerial, spending much of its time feeding in the air. The house swift is generally found on the Asian continent. Each subspecies has a slightly different distribution throughout the continent.

* &quot;Apus nipalensis nipalensis&quot; occupy the area from Nepal to Southeastern China, Japan, and parts of Southeast Asia
* &quot;Apus nipalensis subfurcatus&quot; are in the Malay Peninsula and other islands in Southeast Asia.
* &quot;Apus nipalensis furcatus&quot; are on Java and Bali in Indonesia.
* &quot;Apus nipalensis kuntzi&quot; solely occupy the island of Taiwan.

House swifts live both in urban and rural areas of Asia. They&#x27;ve been found from the mountainous regions of Nepal and in cities and towns in China, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. It has been found in North America only one time in 2012; it was identified as a house swift after DNA sequencing. However, this observation was unaccepted as the bird was dead when found.

== Behavior ==
House swifts have two main areas of nesting: in cliffs or in urban areas. When nesting in urban areas, this species tends to prefer under roof overhangs of buildings or in tunnels. Many nest in cliffs on offshore islands near Vietnam. House swifts build their nest using their saliva to messily stick together leaves, branches and feathers.

=== Reproduction ===
The house swift has one breeding period with, generally, two broods per year. The first egg-laying period takes three weeks. By early June, all fledglings from the first clutch have taken flight. A few weeks later, the second clutch hatches. The last fledglings leave the nest by mid-September. The clutch sizes can vary, ranging anywhere from one to five eggs. The incubation period can last anywhere from 20 to 30 days.

=== Diet ===
Like many swallows and swifts, house swifts eat in the air. They mainly feed on small organisms that are dispersed throughout the air. A fecal analysis discovered the house swift diet is almost solely from the arthropoda phylum. This primarily includes, but is not limited to, ants, spiders, mosquitos, and flies.

=== Vocalizations ===
House swifts make a &quot;ti-ti-ti-tititrrrrrr&quot; sound, among many others, as part of their vocal catalogues.

== Migration ==
Not much research has been done specifically on the migration of house swifts. They have been recorded in Northern Australia and India, indicating some sort of movement during winter.

<text>Emilio Gino Segrè (; 1 February 1905 – 22 April 1989) was an Italian and naturalized-American physicist and Nobel laureate, who discovered the elements technetium and astatine, and the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959 along with Owen Chamberlain.

Born in Tivoli, near Rome, Segrè studied engineering at the University of Rome La Sapienza before taking up physics in 1927. Segrè was appointed assistant professor of physics at the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the Via Panisperna boys. From 1936 to 1938 he was director of the Physics Laboratory at the University of Palermo. After a visit to Ernest O. Lawrence&#x27;s Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, he was sent a molybdenum strip from the laboratory&#x27;s cyclotron accelerator in 1937, which was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. Using careful chemical and theoretical analysis, Segrè was able to prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element, named technetium, the first artificially synthesized chemical element that does not occur in nature.

In 1938 and while Segrè was visiting the Berkeley Radiation laboratory, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s fascist government passed antisemitic laws barring Jews from university positions. As a Jew, Segrè was rendered an indefinite émigré. At the Berkeley Radiation Lab, Lawrence offered him an underpaid job as a research assistant. There, Segrè helped discover the element astatine and the isotope plutonium-239, which was later used to make the Fat Man nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki. From 1943 to 1946 he worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory as a group leader for the Manhattan Project. He found in April 1944 that Thin Man, the proposed plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon, would not work due to the presence of plutonium-240 impurities. In 1944, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. On his return to Berkeley in 1946, he became a professor of physics and of history of science, serving until 1972. Segrè and Owen Chamberlain co-headed a research group at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory that discovered the antiproton, for which the two shared the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Segrè was an active photographer who took many pictures documenting events and people in the history of modern science, which were donated to the American Institute of Physics after his death. The American Institute of Physics named its photographic archive of physics history in his honor.

==Early life==
Emilio Gino Segrè was born into a Sephardic Jewish family in Tivoli, near Rome, on 1 February 1905, the son of Giuseppe Segrè, a businessman who owned a paper mill, and Amelia Susanna Treves. He had two older brothers, Angelo and Marco. His uncle, Gino Segrè, was a law professor. He was educated at the &quot;ginnasio&quot; in Tivoli and, after the family moved to Rome in 1917, the &quot;ginnasio&quot; and &quot;liceo&quot; in Rome. He graduated in July 1922 and enrolled in the University of Rome La Sapienza as an engineering student.

In 1927, Segrè met Franco Rasetti, who introduced him to Enrico Fermi. The two young physics professors were looking for talented students. They attended the Como Conference in September 1927, where Segrè heard lectures from notable physicists including Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Robert Millikan, Wolfgang Pauli, Max Planck and Ernest Rutherford. Segrè then joined Fermi and Rasetti at their laboratory in Rome. With the help of the director of the Institute of Physics, Orso Mario Corbino, Segrè was able to transfer to physics, and, studying under Fermi, earned his laurea degree in July 1928, with a thesis on &quot;Anomalous Dispersion and Magnetic Rotation&quot;.

After a stint in the Italian Army from 1928 to 1929, during which he was a commissioned as a second lieutenant in the antiaircraft artillery, Segrè returned to the laboratory on Via Panisperna. He published his first article, which summarised his thesis, &quot;On anomalous dispersion in mercury and in lithium&quot;, jointly with Edoardo Amaldi in 1928, and another article with him the following year on the Raman effect.

In 1930, Segrè began studying the Zeeman effect in certain alkaline metals. When his progress stalled because the diffraction grating he required to continue was not available in Italy, he wrote to four laboratories elsewhere in Europe asking for assistance and received an invitation from Pieter Zeeman to finish his work at Zeeman&#x27;s laboratory in Amsterdam. Segrè was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and, on Fermi&#x27;s advice, elected to use it to study under Otto Stern in Hamburg. Working with Otto Frisch on space quantization produced results that apparently did not agree with the current theory; but Isidor Isaac Rabi showed that theory and experiment were in agreement if the nuclear spin of potassium was +1/2.

==Physics professor==
Segrè was appointed assistant professor of physics at the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the Via Panisperna boys. In 1934, he met Elfriede Spiro, a Jewish woman whose family had come from Ostrowo in West Prussia, but had fled to Breslau when that part of Prussia became part of Poland after World War I. After the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933, she had emigrated to Italy, where she worked as a secretary and an interpreter. At first she did not speak Italian well, and Segrè and Spiro conversed in German, in which he was fluent. The two were married at the Great Synagogue of Rome on 2 February 1936. He agreed with the rabbi to spend the minimal amount on the wedding, giving the balance of what would be spent on a luxury wedding to Jewish refugees from Germany. The rabbi managed to give them many of the trappings of a luxury wedding anyway. The couple had three children: Claudio, born in 1937, Amelia Gertrude Allegra, born in 1937, and Fausta Irene, born in 1945.
After marrying, Segrè sought a stable job and became professor of physics and director of the Physics Institute at the University of Palermo. He found the equipment there primitive and the library bereft of modern physics literature, but his colleagues at Palermo included the mathematicians Michele Cipolla and Michele De Franchis, the mineralogist Carlo Perrier and the botanist . In 1936 he paid a visit to Ernest O. Lawrence&#x27;s Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, where he met Edwin McMillan, Donald Cooksey, Franz Kurie, Philip Abelson and Robert Oppenheimer. Segrè was intrigued by the radioactive scrap metal that had once been part of the laboratory&#x27;s cyclotron. In Palermo, this was found to contain a number of radioactive isotopes. In February 1937, Lawrence sent him a molybdenum strip that was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. Segrè enlisted Perrier&#x27;s help to subject the strip to careful chemical and theoretical analysis, and they were able to prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element. In 1947 they named it technetium, as it was the first artificially synthesized chemical element.

==Radiation Laboratory==
In June 1938, Segrè paid a summer visit to California to study the short-lived isotopes of technetium, which did not survive being mailed to Italy. While Segrè was en route, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s fascist government passed racial laws barring Jews from university positions. As a Jew, Segrè was now rendered an indefinite émigré. The Czechoslovakian crisis prompted Segrè to send for Elfriede and Claudio, as he now feared that war in Europe was inevitable. In November 1938 and February 1939 they made quick trips to Mexico to exchange their tourist visas for immigration visa. Both Segrè and Elfriede held grave fears for the fate of their parents in Italy and Germany.

At the Berkeley Radiation Lab, Lawrence offered Segrè a job as a research assistant—a relatively lowly position for someone who had discovered an element—for a month for six months. When Lawrence learned that Segrè was legally trapped in California, he took advantage of the situation to reduce Segrè&#x27;s salary to $116 a month. Working with Glenn Seaborg, Segrè isolated the metastable isotope technetium-99m. Its properties made it ideal for use in nuclear medicine, and it is now used in about 10 million medical diagnostic procedures annually. Segrè went looking for element 93, but did not find it, as he was looking for an element chemically akin to rhenium instead of a rare-earth element, which is what element 93 was. Working with Alexander Langsdorf, Jr., and Chien-Shiung Wu, he discovered xenon-135, which later became important as a nuclear poison in nuclear reactors.

Segrè then turned his attention to another missing element on the periodic table, element 85. After he announced how he intended to create it by bombarding bismuth-209 with alpha particles at a Monday meeting Radiation Laboratory meeting, two of his colleagues, Dale R. Corson and Robert A. Cornog carried out his proposed experiment. Segrè then asked whether he could do the chemistry and, with Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, successfully isolated the new element, which is today called astatine. Segrè and Wu then attempted to find the last remaining missing non-transuranic element, element 61. They had the correct technique for making it, but lacked the chemical methods to separate it. He also worked with Seaborg, McMillan, Joseph W. Kennedy and Arthur C. Wahl to create plutonium-239 in Lawrence&#x27;s cyclotron in December 1940.

==Manhattan Project==
The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the subsequent United States declaration of war upon Italy rendered Segrè an enemy alien and cut him off from communication with his parents. Physicists began leaving the Radiation Laboratory to do war work, and Raymond T. Birge asked him to teach classes to the remaining students. This provided a useful supplement to Segrè&#x27;s income, and he established important friendships and professional associations with some of these students, who included Owen Chamberlain and Clyde Wiegand.

In late 1942, Oppenheimer asked Segrè to join the Manhattan Project at its Los Alamos Laboratory. Segrè became the head of the laboratory&#x27;s P-5 (Radioactivity) Group, which formed part of Robert Bacher&#x27;s P (Experimental Physics) Division. For security reasons, he was given the cover name of Earl Seaman. He moved to Los Alamos with his family in June 1943.

Segrè&#x27;s group set up its equipment in a disused Forest Service cabin in the Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos in August 1943. His group&#x27;s task was to measure and catalog the radioactivity of various fission products. An important line of research was determining the degree of isotope enrichment achieved with various samples of enriched uranium. Initially, the tests using mass spectrometry, used by Columbia University, and neutron assay, used by Berkeley, gave different results. Segrè studied Berkeley&#x27;s results and could find no error, while Kenneth Bainbridge likewise found no fault with New York&#x27;s. However, analysis of another sample showed close agreement. Higher rates of spontaneous fission were observed at Los Alamos, which Segrè&#x27;s group concluded were due to cosmic rays, which were more prevalent at Los Alamos due to its high altitude.

The group measured the activity of thorium, uranium-234, uranium-235 and uranium-238, but only had access to microgram quantities of plutonium-239. The first sample plutonium produced in the nuclear reactor at Oak Ridge was received in April 1944. Within days the group observed five times the rate of spontaneous fission as with the cyclotron-produced plutonium. This was not news that the leaders of the project wanted to hear. It meant that Thin Man, the proposed plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon, would not work and implied that the project&#x27;s investment in plutonium production facilities at the Hanford Site was wasted. Segrè&#x27;s group carefully checked their results and concluded that the increased activity was due to the plutonium-240 isotope.

In June 1944, Segrè was summoned into Oppenheimer&#x27;s office and informed that while his father was safe, his mother had been rounded up by the Nazis in October 1943. Segrè never saw either of his parents again. His father died in Rome in October 1944. In late 1944, Segrè and Elfriede became naturalized citizens of the United States. His group, now designated R-4, was given responsibility for measuring the gamma radiation from the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. The blast damaged or destroyed most of the experiments, but enough data was recovered to measure the gamma rays.

==Later life==
In August 1945, a few days before the surrender of Japan and the end of World War II, Segrè received an offer from Washington University in St. Louis of an associate professorship with a salary of . The following month, the University of Chicago also made him an offer. After some prompting, Birge offered $6,500 and a full professorship, which Segrè decided to accept. He left Los Alamos in January 1946 and returned to Berkeley.

In the late 1940s, many academics left the University of California, lured away by higher-salary offers and by the university&#x27;s peculiar loyalty oath requirement. Segrè chose to take the oath and stay, but this did not allay suspicions about his loyalty. Luis Alvarez was incensed that Amaldi, Fermi, Pontecorvo, Rasetti and Segrè had chosen to pursue patent claims against the United States for their pre-war discoveries and told Segrè to let him know when Pontecorvo wrote from Russia. He also clashed with Lawrence over the latter&#x27;s plan to create a rival nuclear-weapons laboratory to Los Alamos in Livermore, California, in order to develop the hydrogen bomb, a weapon that Segrè felt would be of dubious utility.

Unhappy with his deteriorating relationships with his colleagues and with the poisonous political atmosphere at Berkeley caused by the loyalty oath controversy, Segrè accepted a job offer from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. The courts ultimately resolved the patent claims in the Italian scientists&#x27; favour in 1953, awarding them for the patents related to generating neutrons, which worked out to about $20,000 after legal costs. Kennedy, Seaborg, Wahl and Segrè were subsequently awarded the same amount for their discovery of plutonium, which came to $100,000 after being divided four ways, there being no legal fees this time.

After turning down offers from IBM and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Segrè returned to Berkeley in 1952. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences that same year. He moved his family from Berkeley to nearby Lafayette, California, in 1955. Working with Chamberlain and others, he began searching for the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle of the proton. The antiparticle of the electron, the positron had been predicted by Paul Dirac in 1931 and then discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1932. By analogy, it was now expected that there would be an antiparticle corresponding to the proton, but no one had found one, and even in 1955 some scientists doubted that it existed. Using Lawrence&#x27;s Bevatron set to 6 GeV, they managed to detect conclusive evidence of antiprotons. Chamberlain and Segrè were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. This was controversial, because Clyde Wiegand and Thomas Ypsilantis were co-authors of the same article, but did not share the prize.

Segrè served on the university&#x27;s powerful Budget Committee from 1961 to 1965 and was chairman of the Physics Department from 1965 to 1966. He supported Teller&#x27;s successful bid to separate the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in 1970. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1963. He was one of the trustees of Fermilab from 1965 to 1968. He attended its inauguration with Laura Fermi in 1974. During the 1950s, Segrè edited Fermi&#x27;s papers. He later published a biography of Fermi, &quot;Enrico Fermi: Physicist&quot; (1970). He published his own lecture notes as &quot;From X-rays to Quarks: Modern Physicists and Their Discoveries&quot; (1980) and &quot;From Falling Bodies to Radio Waves: Classical Physicists and Their Discoveries&quot; (1984). He also edited the &quot;Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science&quot; from 1958 to 1977 and wrote an autobiography, &quot;A Mind Always in Motion&quot; (1993), which was published posthumously.

Elfriede died in October 1970, and Segrè married Rosa Mines in February 1972. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1973. That year he reached the University of California&#x27;s compulsory retirement age. He continued teaching the history of physics. In 1974 he returned to the University of Rome as a professor, but served only a year before reaching the mandatory retirement age. Segrè died from a heart attack at the age of 84 while out walking near his home in Lafayette. Active as a photographer, Segrè took many photos documenting events and people in the history of modern science. After his death Rosa donated many of his photographs to the American Institute of Physics, which named its photographic archive of physics history in his honor. The collection was bolstered by a subsequent bequest from Rosa after her death from an accident in Tivoli in 1997.

<text>The Singapore Zoo, formerly known as the Singapore Zoological Gardens or Mandai Zoo, is a zoo located on the margins of Upper Seletar Reservoir within Singapore&#x27;s heavily forested central catchment area. It is operated by the Mandai Wildlife Group, which also manages the neighbouring Night Safari, River Wonders, Bird Paradise as well as the forthcoming Rainforest Wild Park. 

All five parks makes up the Mandai Wildlife Reserve, which consists of more than 15,000 animals from 1,000 species. Opened in 1973, the zoo was built at a cost of $9 million that was granted by the government of Singapore. Within the zoo, there are about 315 species of animals, of which some 16 percent are considered to be a threatened species. The zoo attracts about 2 million visitors every year.

Singapore Zoo has always exhibited animals in naturalistic, &#x27;open&#x27; exhibits with hidden barriers, moats, and glass between the animals and visitors. It houses the largest captive colony of orangutans in the world. The Singapore Zoo has been highly ranked by various international metrics.

==History==
Prior to the establishment of Singapore Zoo, there were other short-lived zoos in Singapore&#x27;s history, including the first recorded zoo founded in the early 1870s at the present-day Singapore Botanic Gardens, a zoo opened in the 1920s in Ponggol (present-day Punggol) by animal trader William Lawrence Soma Basapa and two zoos run by two brothers by the surname of Chan during the 1960s.

The conception of the Singapore Zoo dates from 1969. At the time, the Public Utilities Board (PUBG) decided to use some of its land holdings around reservoirs for parks and open recreational facilities. The executive chairman of the PUB, Dr Ong Swee Law, set aside of land for the construction of a zoological garden.

In 1970, consultants and staff were hired, and in 1971, the construction of the basic 50 enclosures was started. Animals were collected from dealers and donated by sponsors. The director of the National Zoological Gardens of Sri Lanka, Lyn de Alwis, was hired as a special consultant to work out the problems inherent in tropical zoos.

On 27 June 1973, the Singapore Zoo opened its gates for the first time with a collection of 270 animals from over 72 species, and a staff of 130. By 1990, 1,600 animals from more than 160 species lived in social groups, housed in 65 landscaped exhibits with boundaries conceived to look as natural as possible.

In 1987, the zoo began to display rare animals loaned by other zoos. The first animals displayed in this manner were the rare golden snub-nosed monkeys from China in 1987, which attracted more than half a million visitors. This was followed by white tigers from Cincinnati Zoo in 1988 and giant pandas from Wolong National Nature Reserve in 1990.

On 1 August 2000, Singapore Zoological Gardens, Jurong Bird Park and Night Safari were integrated under Wildlife Reserves Singapore, under the umbrella of Temasek Holdings. The zoo underwent a restructuring to improve its efficiency and branding which included the merging of shared services and expansion of consultancy services overseas. Night Safari, which began under the zoo, became a separate branding entity.

The restructuring of the zoo was not without controversy. Several key staff, including CEO Bernard Harrison, left as a result in 2002, citing differences in management style. In 2003, Wildlife Reserves Singapore launched a massive rebranding exercise, which was shelved due to widespread public disapproval. The name of the zoo was simplified to Singapore Zoo sometime by 2005.

As a result of the restructuring, more facilities were launched, such as a S$3.6 million Wildlife Healthcare &amp; Research Centre in 2005. Existing infrastructure was revamped to further enhance the experience of visitors.

==Animals and exhibits==

;Treetops Trail
From a boardwalk, visitors can view northern white-cheeked gibbons and overlook false gharials in the water.Their pair of siamangs moved off-scene because they are being moved to Rainforest Wild

;Orangutan Island
Orangutans have been a major attraction of the Singapore Zoo since its opening. The zoo houses both Bornean orangutans and Sumatran orangutans. A female Sumatran orangutan named Ah Meng became an icon for tourism, appearing in several tourism advertisements. She hosted the &#x27;Breakfast with Orangutans&#x27; program, where visitors were allowed to take pictures and interact with her. Ah Meng died on 8 February 2008 to old age at 47 years old. Ishta, Ah Meng&#x27;s granddaughter, was chosen to take over the namesake of Ah Meng.

;Wild Africa
This area houses the zoo&#x27;s African savannah animals including white rhinos, Grévy&#x27;s zebras, Marabou storks, African painted dogs, cheetahs, red river hogs, meerkats, African lions, giraffes, and nyalas. Located past the lion exhibit are Sri Lankan leopards, a den for naked mole-rats and a fossa exhibit opened in 2019.On August 2024, 0.2 Nile lechwes were brought to the zoo.

;Reptile Kingdom
The outdoor portion of the zoo&#x27;s reptile complex which has enclosures for the zoo&#x27;s larger reptiles such as Aldabra giant tortoises, Komodo dragons, saltwater crocodiles, rhinoceros iguanas, sulcata tortoises, Chinese alligators, Siamese crocodiles, Philippine crocodiles and gharials.

;RepTopia
Opening on 16 August 2017, RepTopia was a renovation of the 35 year old Snake House. Several species of reptiles and amphibians are housed in four different regions, Deserts of the World, Indo-Pacific, Tropical Africa and Neotropical Rainforests; among them are crocodile monitors, electric blue geckos, Gaboon vipers, golden poison frogs, king cobras, Madagascar giant day geckos, plumed basilisks, reticulated pythons, veiled chameleons and western diamondback rattlesnakes. A behind-the-scenes facility is visible to the guests, allowing them to view the hatchery.

In January 2022, thirteen Roti Island snake-necked turtles were successfully repatriated to a breeding facility in Kupang.

;Tortoise Shell-ter
Formerly the Critters Longhouse, which housed small mammals, the building was transformed into the Tortoise Shell-ter in 2016, housing different species of tortoises such as Burmese star tortoises, Indian star tortoises, radiated tortoises and ploughshare tortoises, in seven enclosures, among other reptiles and birds. Each habitat is climate-controlled with special lighting, heating and humidity control.

;Fragile Forest
A 20,000 cubic metre biodome that houses a wide variety of tropical birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and invertebrates. Species kept in the biodome include black-casqued hornbills, great argus, lesser mouse-deer, Linne&#x27;s two-toed sloths, Malayan flying foxes, Malayan peacock-pheasants, Nicobar pigeons, pied imperial pigeons, Prevost&#x27;s squirrels, red-sided eclectus parrots, red ruffed lemurs, spotted whistling ducks, western crowned pigeons, white-faced sakis and zebra doves with golden lion tamarins housed in a small enclosure near the biodome. The area also has a butterfly house consisting of 11 butterfly species, 8 of which are native to Singapore.

;The Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia
Visitors first walk through a Konso and Amharic village with several waga sculptures dotted around. A large troop of hamadryas baboons are mixed with a herd of Nubian ibexes in an enclosure recreating the rugged steppes of Ethiopia. Meerkats, common kusimanse, servals, rock hyraxes and South African ground squirrels are kept in smaller enclosures. A bridge from which you can view the baboons overlooks an enclosure with a pond, home to a pair of spur-winged geese nearby.

;Australasia
This zone features a walkthrough habitat with eastern grey kangaroos, Bennett&#x27;s wallabies and magpie geese along with a southern cassowary enclosure at the end of the zone. Goodfellow&#x27;s tree-kangaroos are housed indoors but are able to access an outdoor enclosure. The zoo&#x27;s male tree-kangaroo named Makaia was born in 2014 at the Adelaide Zoo and orphaned at five weeks old when his mother, Kia was crushed by a falling tree branch. He made headlines after he was adopted by a yellow-footed rock wallaby. Makaia arrived at the Singapore Zoo in 2016 to accompany the zoo&#x27;s female tree-kangaroo, Nupela. On 4 February 2020, Nupela gave birth to a male joey.

Four female koalas named Paddle, Chan, Pellita and Idalia were on loan to the zoo from the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary to celebrate Singapore&#x27;s golden jubilee in April 2015 and returned to Australia in February 2016.

;Primate Kingdom
The Primate Kingdom consists of a large moat with several islands which house various monkeys and lemurs like black-and-gold howler monkeys, black-and-white ruffed lemurs, ring tailed lemurs, cotton-top tamarins, eastern black-and-white colobuses, De Brazza&#x27;s monkeys and some of the only red-shanked doucs in captivity. 

;Elephants of Asia
A herd of five female Asian elephants live in a 2.47 acre (1 ha) habitat with a large pool. Komali, the matriarch of the herd, is a Sri Lankan elephant, Gambir and Jati are Indian elephants and half-sisters Aprila and Intan are Sumatran elephants.

;KidzWorld
Located at the very north of the zoo, KidzWorld is home to many domestic animals like goats, rabbits, horses, pigs, dogs, various domestic galliformes, sulcata tortoises and lots more and there are other attractions in it like a carousel and a splash pad. Guests are allowed to closely interact with the animals and feed them.

;Other animals
Other animals in the zoo include African penguins, Asian small-clawed otters, buff-cheeked gibbons, California sea lions, Celebes crested macaques, chimpanzees, emperor tamarins, great white pelicans, Sumatran bearded pigs, North Sulawesi babirusas, proboscis monkeys, pygmy hippos, red ruffed lemurs, red-capped mangabeys, sun bears and Malayan tigers.

==Education and conservation==
The Wildlife Healthcare &amp; Research Centre was opened in March 2006 as part of the zoo&#x27;s efforts in wildlife conservation. The centre further underscores Singapore Zoo and Night Safari&#x27;s commitment to conservation research, providing the infrastructure for the parks and overseas zoological partners to better execute their research programmes. The Singapore Zoo is the first zoo in the world to breed a polar bear in the tropics. Inuka was born on 26 December 1990, died 25 April 2018 (aged 27).

Animal activist and conservationist known as Steve Irwin admired the Singapore Zoo greatly, adopting it as the &#x27;sister zoo&#x27; to Australia Zoo. He was at the Singapore Zoo in 2006 to officiate the opening of the Australian Outback exhibit.

==Presentations==
&quot;Breakfast in the Wild&quot; allows visitors to meet and interact closely with animals in the zoo, which has previously included Ah Meng (died on 8 February 2008) who was an icon of the Singapore tourism industry. Animal presentations, as well as token feedings coupled with live commentaries by keepers, are also the daily staple in Singapore Zoo.

The &quot;Rainforest Fights Back&quot; presentation is housed in the Shaw Amphitheatre, the main amphitheater in the zoo. Actors and performers act alongside the animals: in-show, a villainous poacher attempts to mow down a section of tropical rainforest for land development, and is foiled by the native people and the animals of the rainforest — orangutans, lemurs, peacocks, otters, coatimumdis and ara parrots.

The &quot;Elephants at Work and Play&quot; presentation demonstrates how elephants are used as beasts of burden in south-east Asian countries. The animal caretakers are referred to as mahouts, and the show simulates how a mahout would instruct an elephant to transport logs or kneel so that they can be mounted. As of 2018, the show has been reworked as part of a shift in the care for the elephants to feature their natural behaviour instead of performing stunts.

The &quot;Splash Safari&quot; presentation features the zoo&#x27;s sea lions performing acts relating to their natural behaviors, and also playing frisbee with a lucky visitor.

The &quot;Animal Friends&quot; presentation, housed in the Rainforest KidzWorld Amphitheatre in the zoo&#x27;s children&#x27;s section, features mostly domesticated animals such as dogs and parrots performing tricks with the aim of teaching young children about pet responsibility.

==Organising events==
There are three events venues in the zoo: Forest Lodge, Pavilion-By-the-Lake and Garden Pavilion. There are also three cocktail venues: Elephants of Asia, Tiger Trek and Treetops Trail. The Singapore Zoo also caters for birthday parties and weddings.

==Incidents==
On 7 March 1973, a black panther escaped from the zoo before it had opened.

In early 1974, a hippopotamus named Congo escaped from the zoo and spent 47 days in the Seletar Reservoir.

Other escapes in 1974 included an eland and a tiger.

On 13 November 2008, two Bengal white tigers mauled a cleaner, 32-year-old Nordin Montong to death after he jumped into a moat surrounding their enclosure and taunted the animals.

<text>The Malaysian Islamic Party, also known as the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (Malay: &quot;Parti Islam Se-Malaysia&quot;; abbrev: PAS), is an Islamist political party in Malaysia. Ideologically focused on Islamic fundamentalism and Malay supremacy; PAS&#x27;s electoral base is largely centred around Peninsular Malaysia&#x27;s rural northern and east coast regions particularly the states of Kelantan, 
Terengganu, Perlis, and Kedah. They also gained significant support in the rural areas of Perak and Pahang in the last 2022 general election and the 2023 state elections; dubbed as the &quot;Green Wave&quot;.

The party was a component party of the then governing Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition which came to power as a result of the 2020–21 Malaysian political crisis. The party governs either solely or as coalition partners in the states of Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, Perlis and Sabah. In the past, it was a coalition partner in the state governments of Penang and Selangor as part of the federal opposition between 2008 and 2018.

Since the 2022 Malaysian general election, the party holds 43 of the 222 seats in the federal Dewan Rakyat, being the largest individual party, and has elected parliamentarians or state assembly members in 11 of the country&#x27;s 13 states. Internationally, PAS is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. Meanwhile, In the State of Sabah, a state located in East Malaysia, PAS is led by Dr. Aliakbar Gulasan, a local politician from descendents of Bajau/Pakistani born in Sabah, Borneo.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The post-World War II period, while Malaya was still under British colonial rule, saw the emergence of the country&#x27;s first formal Islamic political movements. The Malay Nationalist Party (MNP), a left-wing nationalist organisation, was formed in October 1945 and led by Burhanuddin al-Helmy, who would later become the president of PAS. Out of the MNP arose the Pan Malayan Supreme Islamic Council (&quot;Majlis Agama Tertinggi Sa-Malaya&quot; or MATA) in 1947, and MATA in turn formed the party Hizbul Muslimin (&quot;Muslim People&#x27;s Party of Malaya&quot;) in 1948. The central aim of Hizbul Muslimin was the establishment of an independent Malaya as an Islamic state. However, the party did not live beyond 1948. The Malayan Emergency of that year, while a British–Communist dispute, saw the colonial administration arrest a number of the party&#x27;s leaders, and the nascent group disbanded. Nevertheless, the party served as a forerunner to PAS, supplying both the ideology upon which PAS was formed and some of PAS&#x27;s key leaders in its early years.

=== Party formation ===

PAS was founded on 24 November 1951, as the &quot;Persatuan Islam Sa-Malaya&quot; (Pan Malayan Islamic Union) at a meeting in Butterworth, Penang. Shortly after it was renamed &quot;Persatuan Islam sa-Tanah Melayu&quot; (&quot;Tanah Melayu&quot; means &quot;Land of the Malays&quot; and was used by Malays to mean Malaya). It became known as the Pan Malayan Islamic Party (PMIP) before the 1955 election as the registrar of society required it to incorporate the word &quot;party&quot; into its name. Its acronym PAS, originally used in Malay but became more widely adopted in the 1970s, is based the written form in Jawi (ڤاس).

The formation of the party was the culmination of a growing desire among Muslim clerics within the United Malays National Organisation to formalise a discrete Islamic political organisation. However, the lines between UMNO and the new party were initially blurred. PAS allowed dual membership of both parties, and many of its early senior leaders were also UMNO members. The party&#x27;s first president was Ahmad Fuad Hassan, an UMNO cleric. He lasted in the position only until 1953, when he fell out of favour with the party, which was now developing a more distinct identity, and returned to the UMNO fold. Fuad&#x27;s departure coincided with the end of dual membership. The party turned to Abbas Alias, a Western-educated medical doctor, as its second president, although he did not play an active role in the party and was little more than a nominal figurehead.

The party&#x27;s first electoral test was the pre-independence 1955 election to the Federal Legislative Council, the body that preceded the national parliament. 52 single-member seats were up for election; PAS fielded 11 candidates. Hampered by a lack of funds and party organisation, PAS succeeded in having only one candidate elected: Ahmad Tuan Hussein, a teacher at an Islamic school in Kerian, Perak. He was the only opposition member of the council; the other 51 seats were won by members of the Alliance coalition between UMNO, the Malaysian Chinese Association and the Malaysian Indian Congress. PAS&#x27; performance in the election weakened its hand in negotiations with the British over the terms of Malayan independence. Its advocacy for the protection of Malay and Muslim rights, including the recognition of Islam as the country&#x27;s official religion, was ignored. Alias stepped down from the presidency in 1956, handing it voluntarily to the radical nationalist Burhanuddin al-Helmy. This change exemplified a broader trend among PAS&#x27;s leadership in the late 1950s: the party&#x27;s upper echelons gradually became filled with nationalists and long-time UMNO opponents, replacing the UMNO clerics who had initially led the party.

=== Left-wing Islamism ===
Burhanuddin al-Helmy, a prominent anti-colonialist, steered PAS in a socialist and nationalist direction and set about strengthening the party&#x27;s internal structure and geographic reach. In the 1959 election, Malaya&#x27;s first since independence, the party&#x27;s focus on rural constituencies, especially in the north, paid off. Thirteen PAS candidates were elected to the 104-member House of Representatives, and the party took control of the legislative assemblies of the northern states of Kelantan and Terengganu.

However, Burhanuddin&#x27;s leftist Pan-Islamism, under which PAS sought greater ties between the Muslim peoples of Malaya and the Indonesian archipelago, soon led the party into a wedge. The Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation of 1963–66 turned popular Malayan opinion against Indonesia. PAS&#x27;s attacks on Tunku Abdul Rahman&#x27;s Alliance government for seeking Western assistance during the confrontation, and the party&#x27;s continued support for Southeast Asian PAS-Islamism, led to a loss of support in the 1964 election. The party&#x27;s parliamentary cohort was reduced to nine. The party became further marginalised the following year, when Burhanuddin was detained without trial under the Internal Security Act on allegations that he had collaborated with Indonesia.

Political circumstances in the country had changed by the 1969 election. The &quot;Konfrontasi&quot; had ended, Burhanuddin had been released from custody although was too ill to campaign actively, and the Alliance coalition was suffering from internal division as well as unpopularity. PAS&#x27; vote rose to over 20 percent of the national electorate, netting the party 12 seats in Parliament. However, the parliament would not convene until 1971 as the 13 May race riots resulted in the declaration of a state of emergency. The country would be run by a National Operations Council for the following two years. In the meantime, Burhanuddin died in October 1969 and was replaced as PAS&#x27; president by his deputy, Asri Muda.

=== Pivot to Malay nationalism ===
Asri came to the presidency having been PAS&#x27;s de facto leader during Burhanuddin&#x27;s long illness. But this did not mean a seamless transition for the party. While Burhanuddin had been sympathetic to left-wing causes and parties in Malaysia, Asri was first and foremost a Malay nationalist, and was hostile to leftist politics. One of his first acts as President of PAS was to part ways with the party&#x27;s opposition allies on the left, such as the Malaysian People&#x27;s Party. Ideologically, Asri&#x27;s presidency would see the party shift markedly away from the Pas-Islamism of Burhanuddin. The party became principally concerned with the protection and advancement of the rights of ethnic Malays. The party&#x27;s activities also became solely focused on party politics, as reflected in the change of its name in 1971 from the &quot;Persatuan Islam Se-Malaysia&quot; (Pan-Malaysian Islamic Association) to the &quot;Parti Islam Se-Malaysia&quot; (Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, but commonly referred to as Parti Islam, or PAS).

However, Asri&#x27;s most radical change was still to come. In January 1972, he announced that PAS would be joining the Alliance Party coalition (which would soon rebrand itself as Barisan Nasional) as a junior partner to its main rival UMNO. The move was controversial within PAS, and some of its members and senior leaders either left the party or were purged by Asri. Asri&#x27;s principal justification for joining UMNO in a coalition government was that after the 1969 race riots, Malay unity was paramount, and that this required a partnership between the country&#x27;s two ethnic-Malay political parties. Asri himself was given a ministerial position in the cabinet of prime minister Abdul Razak Hussein.

The 1974 election saw PAS competing under the Barisan Nasional banner for the first and only time. The party won 14 parliamentary seats to UMNO&#x27;s 62, cementing PAS&#x27;s position as the junior of the coalition partners. PAS also found itself governing in coalition in Kelantan, which it had previously governed in its own right. PAS&#x27;s vote in its northern strongholds was weakened by a loss of support to both its former opposition allies and renegade PAS candidates running on anti-Barisan Nasional tickets. Ultimately, it was Kelantan, Asri&#x27;s home state and the base of political power, that would trigger the downfall of the UMNO–PAS partnership. After a conflict between Asri and the UMNO-favoured chief minister of the state, Mohamed Nasir, over investigations that Nasir initiated into Asri&#x27;s financial dealings, Asri mobilised the PAS members of the Kelantan State Legislative Assembly to move a no-confidence motion against Nasir. The UMNO assemblymen staged a walk-out, abandoning Asri, driving an irreparable wedge through the coalition and causing a political crisis in the state. Government declared an emergency in the state, allowing the federal government to take control. Asri withdrew PAS from Barisan Nasional in December 1977.

The 1978 election underscored how disastrous PAS&#x27;s foray into the Barisan Nasional had been. The party was reduced to five parliamentary seats and, in separate state-level elections in Kelantan, was routed by UMNO and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Front (BERJASA), which Nasir had founded after leaving PAS. The party&#x27;s fortunes in the Kelantan election were not helped by a ban on public election rallies; while the Barisan Nasional was able to campaign through a compliant mass media, public talks were the principal way in which PAS could reach voters. PAS fared little better in the 1982 election. In the face of a new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, and the decision of the popular Islamist youth leader Anwar Ibrahim to join UMNO instead of PAS, the party was unable to improve on its five parliamentary seats and failed to regain government in Kelantan. Meanwhile, the 1978 to 1982 period coincided with the rise of a new generation of leaders within the party, including foreign-educated Muslim clerics (or &quot;ulama&quot;) such as Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat and Abdul Hadi Awang. This group sought to reorient PAS as an Islamist party and were fundamentally hostile to UMNO, whose Malay nationalist focus they saw to be at the expense of Islam. In 1980 the group succeeded in electing Yusof Rawa to the deputy presidency of the party, ousting the Asri loyalist Abu Bakar Omar. By the time of PAS&#x27;s 1982 assembly, it was clear to Asri that the ulama faction had the numbers to defeat him. He resigned on the floor of the assembly, and subsequently attacked the party through the media, leading to his expulsion and the formation of splinter party, Parti Hizbul Muslimin Malaysia (HAMIM) by Asri in 1983. The following year, in 1983, Yusof was elevated to the presidency, unopposed.

=== Ulama takeover ===
The ulama who took over PAS in 1982 drew from the 1979 Iranian revolution for inspiration in establishing an Islamic state; Yusof Rawa himself had served as Malaysia&#x27;s Ambassador to Iran in the years preceding the revolution. Yusof openly rejected the Malay nationalism that characterised both UMNO and PAS under Asri Muda, considering it a narrow and ignorant philosophy that was contrary to the concept of a Muslim ummah. As if to exemplify the shift in the party&#x27;s ideological outlook under Yusof and his ulama colleagues, the party&#x27;s new leaders adopted a more conservative and religious form of dress, abandoning Malay and western clothing for traditional Arab religious garb. Politics between UMNO and PAS became increasingly religious in nature. The Barisan Nasional government tried to counter the possible electoral appeal of PAS&#x27;s Islamisation by creating a number of state-run Islamic institutions, such as the International Islamic University of Malaysia. PAS leaders responded by labelling such initiatives as superficial and hypocritical, UMNO leaders as &quot;infidels&quot;, and UMNO as the &quot;party of the devil&quot;.

The increasingly divisive rhetoric between UMNO and PAS produced deep divisions in Malay communities, especially in the northern states. Sometimes the divisions became violent, the most infamous example being the 1985 Memali incident, in which the government sanctioned a raid on a village led by the PAS cleric Ibrahim Libya, which left 14 civilians and four policemen dead. It was against this backdrop that the PAS ulama faced their first general election in 1986. The result was a whitewash for the Barisan Nasional coalition. PAS recorded its worst-ever election result, retaining only one seat in Parliament. PAS, in recovering from the defeat, had no choice but to retreat from its hardline Islamism and pursue a moderate course. By 1989, Yusof had become too ill to remain as PAS&#x27;s president, and was replaced by his deputy, Fadzil Noor, another member of the ulama faction that now dominated the party.

=== Electoral revival in the 1990s ===

While not abandoning PAS&#x27;s ideological commitment to the establishment of an Islamic state, Fadzil Noor moderated the party&#x27;s rhetoric. He also set about infusing the party&#x27;s membership with young urban professionals in an attempt to diversify the leadership ranks beyond religious clerics. The 1990s also saw PAS engage in international Islamist movements. Abdul Hadi Awang became active in a number of international Islamic organisations and delegations, and Islamist parties abroad sent delegations to Malaysia to observe PAS.

The first electoral test of Fadzil&#x27;s presidency was the 1990 election, which occurred against the backdrop of a split in UMNO out of which the Semangat 46 opposition party was formed. PAS joined Semangat 46 and two other Malay parties in the United Ummah Front (&quot;Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah&quot;), and won seven parliamentary seats. The new coalition swept the Barisan Nasional from power in Kelantan, winning all of its state assembly seats. Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat, a cleric who played a leading role in the 1982 takeover of the party, became Kelantan&#x27;s Chief Minister, and would remain in the position until his retirement in 2013. One of the first acts of the PAS-led government in Kelantan was to seek to introduce hudud, a criminal punishment system for particular Islamic offences. The move was abandoned after it became clear that the law could not be enforced over the objections of the federal government.

PAS retained its seven parliamentary seats and the government of Kelantan in the 1995 election while all other opposition parties lost ground. By the time of the next election in 1999, circumstances external to PAS had changed its fortunes for the better. The 1997 Asian financial crisis split the Barisan Nasional government between supporters of the Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, and his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim. Mahathir&#x27;s sacking and subsequent detention without trial of Anwar in 1998 provoked widespread opposition, which PAS capitalised on more than any other opposition party. The party ran a sophisticated campaign for the 1999 election, taking advantage of the internet to bypass restrictions on print publications and managing to woo urban professional voters while retaining its traditional rural support base. For the first time, PAS joined the centre-left and secular Democratic Action Party in the Barisan Alternatif coalition which included the new party Keadilan, which was formed by Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, the wife of the now imprisoned Anwar. It resulted in PAS&#x27;s second best electoral performance (behind those of 2022 general election). The party took 27 of 192 parliamentary seats and had landslide state-level victories in Kelantan and Terengganu.

=== PAS in the Pakatan Rakyat ===
The death of Fadzil Noor in 2002, and his replacement by the conservative cleric Abdul Hadi Awang, coincided with a period of division within the party between its younger and professional leaders, who sought to make PAS&#x27;s Islamist ideology more appealing to mainstream Malaysia, and its conservative, and generally older, clerics. The party was unable to reconcile the views of the two factions with a coherent definition of the &quot;Islamic state&quot; that the party&#x27;s platform envisioned. The debate itself caused the DAP to break with the Barisan Alternatif coalition; as a secular party with mainly an ethnic Chinese support base, it could not support the vision of an Islamic state propagated by PAS&#x27;s conservatives. PAS also found itself losing Malay support following the replacement of Mahathir as Prime Minister with Abdullah Badawi, a popular and moderate Muslim, and post-September 11 fears among the electorate about radical Islam in Southeast Asia. If the 1999 election had been the party&#x27;s zenith, the 2004 poll was one of the lowest points in its history. In an expanded Parliament, PAS was reduced to seven seats. Abdul Hadi not only lost his parliamentary seat but saw the government he led in Terengganu thrown from office after one term.

The response of PAS to the 2004 election, like its response to the similar 1986 wipeout, was to abandon the hardline image that had contributed to its defeat. By now, the urban professional wing of the party&#x27;s membership, brought into the party by Fadzil Noor in the 1990s, was ready to take charge. While Abdul Hadi&#x27;s presidency was not under threat, the moderate faction, known as the &quot;Erdogans&quot; after the moderate Turkish Islamist leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had its members voted into other key positions in the party&#x27;s 2005 general assembly. PAS was now able to attack Abdullah Badawi&#x27;s government from both the right and the left: on the one hand, it criticised Abdullah&#x27;s promotion of Islam Hadhari as a watered-down version of Islam; on the other, it attacked the government for its human rights record and promoted the causes of social and economic justice, including for non-Muslims. The party also capitalised on the growth of the internet and social media in Malaysia to bypass the pro-government mass media.

Ahead of the 2008 election PAS joined the DAP and Anwar Ibrahim&#x27;s Keadilan, which was now known as People&#x27;s Justice Party (PKR) in a new coalition, Pakatan Rakyat. The coalition handed the Barisan Nasional its worst-ever election result. Barisan Nasional lost its two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives, disabling it from passing constitutional amendments without opposition support. PAS won 23 seats; the Pakatan Rakyat as a whole won 82. At state level, decades-old Barisan Nasional governments fell in Kedah, Perak and Selangor. PAS now governed Kedah and Kelantan (led respectively by Azizan Abdul Razak and Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat) and supplied the Chief Minister of Perak (Nizar Jamaluddin) in a Pakatan Rakyat coalition government.

PAS&#x27;s 2009 general assembly saw latent fissures within the party come out into the open. The incumbent deputy president Nasharudin Mat Isa, a Malay nationalist who promoted greater co-operation between PAS and UMNO, was challenged by two moderate candidates. Nasharudin survived with the backing of the conservative ulama faction; his two opponents had split the moderate vote. But at the 2011 assembly, Nasharudin was not so lucky: Mohamad Sabu, a leading moderate close to Anwar Ibrahim, commanded the support of the &quot;Erdogan&quot; wing and toppled him. Sabu&#x27;s election was a significant defeat for the ulama faction. He was the first non-cleric to serve as the party&#x27;s deputy president in over 20 years.

The Pakatan Rakyat coalition went into the 2013 election facing Najib Razak, who had replaced Abdullah as Prime Minister in 2009 but failed to improve the government&#x27;s fortunes, especially among urban voters. PAS made a concerted effort to expand its voter base beyond the northern peninsula states, and campaigned heavily in Johor, where it had never won a parliamentary seat. The election witnessed a significant degree of cross-over ethnic voting: Chinese voters in Malay-majority seats decided in large numbers to support PAS, to maximise the chances of a national Pakatan Rakyat victory. Pakatan Rakyat garnered 50.8 percent of the national popular vote but could not win a majority in parliament. PAS, however, suffered a net loss of two parliamentary seats. This was principally attributable to a swing against the party in Kedah, where the party was removed from state government after one term and lost four parliamentary seats.

=== After Nik Aziz: splintering and far-right turn, jump to Gagasan Sejahtera ===
When PAS saw its share of seats shrink in the 2013 election, it started to reassert its Islamic agenda. The passing of spiritual leader Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat in 2015 –who was known to be sympathetic and friendly to non-Malays and non-Muslims– shifted PAS more to the right-wing. In the meantime, DAP criticised its president Abdul Hadi Awang for pushing a bill on hudud without consulting his opposition partners. This incident led to the DAP announcing in March 2015 that it would no longer work with the PAS leader. The rift worsened after conservatives captured PAS leadership, as progressive leaders endorsed by the late Nik Aziz himself were voted out of office in party elections, characterised by the media as an intentional wipe out and purge, members of this progressive faction left and splintered as the new National Trust Party (&quot;Parti Amanah Negara&quot;, PAN) helmed by Mohamad Sabu. The now purged PAS accepted a motion by its conservative ulama wing to sever ties with DAP. In response, DAP&#x27;s Secretary-General Lim Guan Eng said that the Pakatan Rakyat coalition no longer exists as a result of the violation of the coalition&#x27;s Common Policy Framework, of which PAS had violated by intentionally severing ties with DAP. The coalition was replaced by Pakatan Harapan, which the newly formed PAN joined as a founding member.

The party formed Gagasan Sejahtera with Malaysia National Alliance Party (IKATAN) in 2016, with BERJASA joining the coalition the same year. The coalition entered the 2018 Malaysian general election using the PAS logo and contested 158 seats, with PAS contesting 155 of them. The coalition was able to win 18 parliamentary seats as well as wrangle control of the state of Terrenganu from BN, which PAS had last ruled in 2004, in addition to retaining control of Kelantan and denying supermajority of BN state government in Pahang.They also managed to took many of Barisan Nasional state seats in Kedah. However, PAS was the only party to win any seats as both BERJASA and IKATAN remained without representation.

===Participation of 2018 Anti-ICERD Rally===

In 2018, following the then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad&#x27;s announcement of the Seventh Mahathir cabinet&#x27;s decision for the government to &quot;ratify all remaining core UN instruments related to the protection of human rights&quot;, including International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) and other five previously unratified conventions at a United Nations General Assembly, UMNO, PAS along with various non-governmental organisations, staged an Anti-ICERD Rally that was held at the Dataran Merdeka, Kuala Lumpur, to protest against the ratifications of the relevant international conventions, due to their perception that these human rights instruments contravene with the special position of the Malays, Bumiputera and Islam within the country; all of which are enshrined within the Malaysian Constitution.

=== 2020–2022 Malaysian political crisis ===

In February 2020, PAS President Abdul Hadi Awang, in concert with Bersatu President Muhyiddin Yassin, UMNO leaders Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and Ismail Sabri Yaakob and PKR defector members led by Azmin Ali, collectively convened at the Sheraton Petaling Jaya hotel to initiate a change in government, thus causing political instability by depriving the elected Pakatan Harapan government of a majority within the 14th Malaysian Parliament. As a result, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad (along with the Seventh Mahathir cabinet) tendered their resignation. In March 2020, after the Yang di-Pertuan Agong consulted all members of the 14th Malaysian Parliament, Muhyiddin Yassin was deemed to have the greatest support within Parliament and was selected as the 8th Prime Minister of Malaysia (without an electoral mandate).

=== Renewed co-operation with UMNO and joining Perikatan Nasional ===
In September 2019, UMNO decided to form a pact with PAS called Muafakat Nasional. Its express purpose was to unite the Malay Muslim communities for electoral purposes. However, this co-operation did not cover the rest of Barisan Nasional, which UMNO was member to, despite calls for a migration to the new alliance. Barisan Nasional continued to function as a separate coalition of four parties comprising UMNO, MCA, MIC and PBRS.

During the Tanjung Piai by-election, PAS vice-president Mohd Amar Nik Abdullah stated that PAS would support the candidate nominated by Barisan Nasional, which was reaffirmed by PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang.

On 23 February 2020, PAS held an extraordinary meeting Janda Baik, Pahang together with the UMNO in the lead up to the 2020-21 Malaysian political crisis. PAS President Hadi Awang was among the entourage of then-opposition political leaders as well as members of government that visited the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to discuss the formation of a new government on 23 February.

On 24 February, Mahathir announced his resignation as prime minister, followed by the withdrawal of Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (BERSATU) as well as 11 PKR MPs led by Azmin Ali from Pakatan Rakyat&#x27;s successor coalition, Pakatan Harapan. This led to the collapse of the government as the remaining three parties, the DAP, PKR, and Amanah did not have enough seats for a majority. PAS along with UMNO declared their support for Mahathir to remain as prime minister.

On 25 February, UMNO and PAS revealed that they had withdrawn their prior support for Mahathir to continue as prime minister, and instead called for the dissolution of parliament. It was previously reported that as all political factions voiced their support for Mahathir, he was intent on establishing a &quot;unity government&quot;, which the two parties could not agree with. Annuar Musa, UMNO&#x27;s secretary-general, said the basis of negotiations with Mahathir was that UMNO and PAS would lend their support to form an alternative coalition without DAP. Therefore, both PAS and UMNO instead announced their support for a snap election.

On 28 February, PAS then released a statement announcing their support for the BERSATU president, Muhyiddin Yassin to be appointed as the 8th Prime Minister, with every Muafakat Nasional MPs also signing statutory declarations in support of Muhyiddin.

On 29 February, BERSATU President Muhyiddin Yassin and his allies including party leaders from UMNO, PAS, Gabungan Parti Sarawak, Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah, and the Homeland Solidarity Party had an audience with the Agong to discuss the formation of a government. He announced that his coalition consisting of BERSATU, UMNO, PAS, PBRS, GPS, and STAR would be called Perikatan Nasional. and claimed that they had majority support in parliament to elect a Prime Minister and to form a government.

In the Muhyiddin cabinet, which was formed on 10 March 2020, three PAS MPs became were given ministerial positions and five PAS MPs were afforded the position of deputy ministers.

===Sanusi&#x27;s controversial remarks about the Selangor Sultan===


On the night of 11 July 2023, during a political talk in Selayang, a town in the District of Gombak, Selangor for the upcoming 2023 Malaysian State Elections, PAS Election Director and Menteri Besar of Kedah Sanusi had reportedly belittled and drawn a comparison between the Kedah and Selangor sultans, and said the Kedah ruler would not have appointed Amirudin Shari as the Menteri Besar. His statement has caused an outrage nationwide, especially for Selangorians because the Malay Royal Institutions should be respected just as stated in the second Rukun Negara. This is because Malaysia&#x27;s sultans play a largely ceremonial role, including acting as custodians of Islam in the Muslim-majority country, and are held in deep respect.

Sanusi drew comparisons between the Sultan of Kedah (Al-Aminul Karim Sultan Sallehuddin Sultan Badlishah) and the Sultan of Selangor (Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah) in appointing Amirudin as Menteri Besar back in 2018 after an unprecedented win of Pakatan Harapan in the 14th General Elections which he labelled using Kedah-Northern dialect as &#x27;Cokia&#x27; (substandard or useless) and body shamed him as &#x27;Inci Pun Tak Berapa Nak Cukup&#x27; (unfit for duties).

Due to his statements, numerous police reports have been made and also the representatives on behalf of the Selangor Sultan itself, The Council of Royal Selangor, has lodge a legal action to take Sanusi as a serious (criminal) matter. Datuk Emran Abdul Kadir, one of its members stated that Sanusi must immediately apologise for disputing Sultan&#x27;s prerogative.

Other notable figures who voiced out against Sanusi were, Hashim Jasin, the Spiritual Leader of PAS reminded Sanusi to watch his mouth. In the contrary, former Minister of Health Khairy Jamaludin stated that watching his mouth will not change his gung-ho image. Then, UMNO President Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told Kedahans to not vote on a joker as he was referring to Sanusi during the upcoming state polls. Next, The Communications and Digital Minister, Fahmi Fadzil condemned Sanusi&#x27;s alleged insults against Selangor Sultan by asking him to prepare for the consequences. Same goes to, The Home Affairs Minister, Saifuddin Nasution Ismail which told the press that issues relating with 3R (Race, Religion, and Royalty) has negative consequences which Sanusi must be held accountable for his actions and the government has many other things to do rather than banning his TikTok account.

After the outcry, on 14 July 2023, made a press conference Sanusi issues a formal apology letter to the Sultan and told the press that his words was taken out of context. Sanusi also confirmed that he had given his statement to the police to complete an investigation into the report launched by PKR Youth and other political parties. He was informed by the Selangor Royal Office that the Sultan has replied his letter which he refused to disclose the contents of the replied letter due to the respect of the nobility of the Selangor Royal Institution.

In response, Menteri Besar Amiruddin Shari was furious about the statement and told that Sanusi should be held accountable for the comments and must act more responsibly as befitting his position. He urges Sanusi to learn from him on how to develop Kedah and stop lying to his voters and the masses. He also puzzled about his apology and remind Malaysians to focus on facts and data to help develop the respective states and country.

On 17 July 2023, The Commissioner of PAS in Selangor, Ahmad Yunus Hairi and The Selangor Police Chief, Dato Hussein Omar Khan has made an audience with Sultan Sharafuddin to discuss about the matter. Hence, the Selangor Royal Office has made a Royal Decree that &#x27;the issue is yet to be resolved&#x27;.

Despite the clarifications and the apology, Sanusi was detained and taken into custody by the Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) on the wee hours of 18 July 2023 after the Perikatan Nasional&#x27;s Supreme Council Meeting held at their headquarters in Solaris Dutamas, Segambut, Kuala Lumpur.

Harian Metro reported that Sanusi was arrested at his hotel room in Mont Kiara by 20 officers from the Classified Criminal Investigations Department (USJT) and Bukit Aman&#x27;s Anti-Vice, Gambling, and Secret Societies Division (D7). They ordered him to get out of his room, and taken him to a Toyota Fortuner four-wheel drive heading to the Gombak District Police Headquarters (IPD). He was heavily escorted with the PDRM Selangor Contingent of Crime Investigation Department (JSJ) Vehicles.

According to The Star, his political secretary, Hilmi Abd Wahab, said that Sanusi saw two men in dark clothes standing at the emergency exit. As minutes went by, more and more uniformed men showed up, before finally, at 2.30am, a total of 20 policemen were reportedly standing outside his hotel room. He was told that Sanusi was detained under Section 4(1)(a) (Act 15) of the Sediction Act which he needs to attend legal proceedings at the Selayang Sessions Court. This was confirmed by the PDRM&#x27;s Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Razarudin Husain as he stated that investigation papers about 3Rs has been sent to the Attorney General of Malaysia. Included in the papers as well are, former Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, PAS President Abdul Hadi Awang, and former Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng. He also included that Sanusi refused to answer calls which leads to his sudden arrest. Hence, it is a seizable offense because the report was lodged by the Selangor Royal Council of which it involves the Agong and Selangor Sultan. Also, Razarudin clarifies that 3R is a serious matter because Sanusi&#x27;s case could leads to insulting all the other Malay Rulers as well.

Later in the morning, he was seen at the Selayang Sessions Court at 8:55 a.m.. However, Astro Awani during a live broadcast reported that he entered the court using the back entrance in purpose to avoid the media.

According to Free Malaysia Today, the disgraced Sanusi pleaded not guilty to two charges, both framed under Section 4(1)(a) (Act 15) of the Sedition Act 1948 at two separate courts. The judges of the case were Nor Rajiah Mat Zin and Osman Affendi Mohd Shalleh.

The provision carries a punishment of up to a RM5,000 in fine, three years in jail, or both for first-time offenders. He is said to have committed the offence at Simpang Empat, Taman Selayang Mutiara in Gombak, Selangor, on 11 July. The second charge he faces is in relation to a statement that he made that was &quot;inclined to incite disloyalty against the Rulers&quot;. He is said to have committed the same offence at the same place and time for this charge. He was allowed bail of RM5,000 for both charges, and both courts have imposed a gag order on Sanusi to stop him from making any comments regarding the case.

Amid criticism of the use of the controversial Sedition Act against a political opponent, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim stressed that the case relates to “the position and dignity” of Malaysian&#x27;s monarchs. He further added that he refuse to meddle in the matter as the charges were laid by the Attorney General, after a police investigation that followed the proper procedures.

Meanwhile, Law and Institutional Reforms Minister Azalina Othman Said said that the government was mooting a new law to tackle the so-called 3R issues, to replace the controversial Sedition Act from 1948. She also stated the Sanusi actions will notabsolve criminal offence. The government will hold discussions with relevant parties to assess the matter with stakeholders.

Negative remarks about the Malaysian&#x27;s Royalty can be prosecuted under a colonial-era law, The Sedition Act 1948, which has been used against people who criticise the Sultans on social media. However, sedition charges brought against Malaysian politicians have been rare in recent years. Neighbouring Thailand has a strict lese-majeste law banning insults against its monarchy.

== Ideology and policies ==

According to Farish A. Noor, a Malaysian academic who has written a complete history of PAS:

From the day PAS was formed, in November 1951, the long-term goal of creating an Islamic state in Malaysia has been the beacon that has driven successive generations of PAS leaders and members ever forward. What has changed is the meaning and content of the signifier &#x27;Islamic state&#x27;

From time to time, PAS&#x27;s pursuit of an &quot;Islamic state&quot; has involved attempts to legislate for &quot;hudud&quot;—an Islamic criminal justice system—in the states that it governs. Such laws would apply to all Muslims and would not apply to non-Muslims. PAS-dominated state assemblies in Kelantan and Terengganu passed &quot;hudud&quot; laws in the early 1990s and early 2000s respectively, although neither has ever been enforced due to opposition from the federal government. PAS returned to its pursuit of &quot;hudud&quot; laws after the 2013 election, signalling that it would table bills in the federal Parliament to allow the laws, still on the statute books in Kelantan, to be enforced. The bills would require a two-thirds majority in the Parliament as they involve constitutional amendments.

After PAS&#x27;s electoral rout in 2004, the party sought to broaden its policies beyond Islamism. Among other things, the party focused on calling for improved civil liberties and race relations. However, these policy shifts have proven controversial within the party; conservatives have considered them part of a dilution of PAS&#x27;s commitment to an Islamic state.

When PAS was defeated in Terengganu, enforcement of female dress codes was reduced. The state PAS government in Kelantan banned traditional Malay dance theatres, banned advertisements depicting women who are not fully clothed, and enforced the wearing of headscarves. However, they allowed gender-segregated cinemas and concerts. Some government-controlled bodies pressure non-Muslims also to wear headscarves, and all students of the International Islamic University of Malaysia and female officers in the Royal Malaysian Police are required to wear headscarves in public ceremonies.

The PAS party wishes that the death penalty be enacted for Muslims who attempt to convert, as part of their ultimate desire to turn Malaysia into an Islamic state. The party is also against the government-backed wave of Anti-Shi&#x27;a persecution.

===Ties and linkages with the Muslim Brotherhood===
PAS has also maintained close personal and ideological ties with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. The party&#x27;s relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood dates back to the 1940s when PAS&#x27;s founders were exposed to the ideas and teachings of the Muslim Brotherhood while they were studying in Cairo during the 1940s. According to Wan Saiful Wan Jan of the think tank Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs, the Muslim Brotherhood regards PAS as a model for a successful Muslim political party; since PAS has governed the state of Kelantan continually since 1990. PAS representatives are often invited to Muslim Brotherhood speaking engagements overseas. In 2012, PAS President Abdul Hadi Awang spoke alongside Muslim Brotherhood scholar Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi at a speaking event in London. That same year, PAS representatives met with Muslim Brotherhood leaders Sheikh Mahdi Akif and Dr Muhammad Badie in Cairo.

According to Müller, PAS&#x27;s current generation of leaders, the Ulama Leadership (&quot;Kepimpinan Ulama&quot;) was also influenced by Muslim Brotherhood ideology while studying in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and India during the 1980s. Muslim Brotherhood–inspired Islamic education methods (&quot;tarbiyah&quot;) and regular study circles (&quot;usrah/halaqah&quot;) were systematically introduced while networks were established with Muslim political parties and movements abroad. In April 2014, Awang criticised the governments of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates for designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation. In January 2016, former PAS leader Mujahid Yusof Rawa claimed that the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s influence on PAS was limited to sharing the organisation&#x27;s views on the role of Islam in society. Rawa also claimed that other local Muslim groups such as &quot;Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia&quot; (ABIM; Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia) and IKRAM were also sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood.

==Controversies==
===Militia Parade Incident===
The Terengganu police have announced an investigation into a controversial parade organized by the local PAS Youth group, which took place on 19 February 2023. The police were initially informed about the march, but they were not aware that some supporters would be carrying replica weapons, causing concern among certain groups. DCP Datuk Rohaimi Md Isa, the police chief, has stated that preliminary investigations will be conducted to determine if any offences were committed during the event, and appropriate action will be taken accordingly. Images circulating on social media showed members of Terengganu PAS Youth dressed in medieval Islamic war attire and wielding fake swords, spears, and shields. The parade was reportedly part of a two-day gathering called &quot;Himpunan Pemuda Islam Terengganu&quot; (Himpit), held at a resort in Setiu, Terengganu. Religious Affairs Minister Datuk Dr. Mohd Na’im Mokhtar criticized the parade, expressing that it presented an inappropriate image of Islam, emphasizing the importance of promoting peace and unity in society. He also called for authorities to investigate any potential legal violations. Social media photos also depicted a pickup truck carrying a large fake sword, with youths dressed in militant costumes standing on its cargo bed while it was in motion.

===Support for the Taliban===
After the Taliban took over Kabul in 2021 and re-established an Islamic theocracy in Afghanistan, PAS international affairs and external relations committee chairman, Muhammad Khalil Abdul Hadi (also the son of the incumbent PAS president), congratulated the Islamist militant group for &quot;successfully achieving victory for their country&quot; on Twitter and Facebook, stating its liberation from Western powers.

In August 2021, Khalil also added that the Taliban had also become more moderate, spuriously claiming that women&#x27;s rights (including women&#x27;s freedom of movement) and the opportunities for women in the workforce were preserved. The unsubstantiated comments were widely condemned by numerous Malaysian social media users, and Muhammad Khalil Abdul Hadi&#x27;s pro-Taliban posts on Facebook and Twitter were taken down in response. In March 2022, numerous independent news reports indicated that women and girls in Afghanistan were deprived (by decrees from the Taliban) from their ability to work, study or move freely within the country.

In October 2021, the leader of PAS&#x27;s youth wing, Khairil Nizam Khirudin, proposed closer ties between PAS and the Taliban. He claimed that if China was able build ties with the Taliban, Malaysia should also do so.

In August 2021, PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang alleged that Western media made false accusations against the Taliban to advance an Islamophobic agenda, without studying and fully understanding the religion of Islam. He also repeated the Taliban claim, that the Taliban provided broad amnesty to government officials of the toppled Islamic Republic of Afghanistan; this claim was disputed as numerous independent reports with evidence indicated that the Taliban instead conducted enforced disappearances, summary executions and revenge killings against the former government officials. In the same article, Abdul Hadi Awang also alleged that the Taliban undertook a celebratory approach to the diversity of society within a multi-ethnic Afghanistan; this claim was also disputed as numerous evident news reports indicated that the Taliban engaged in the persecution of Hazaras (who numerous Taliban fighters deem as heretical), censorship against journalists and the news media, violence against journalists, arbitrary arrest and detention, political repression. Most notably, anyone from a religious minority who was an apostate of Islam is sentenced to death.

In February 2022, PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang spuriously alleged that various media were anti-Islam and slandered the Taliban, as according to him, the media were making unsubstantiated claims that the Taliban were denying girls and women the right to education. However, in March 2022, numerous evident news reports indicated that the Taliban prevented girls from attending secondary schools throughout the educational system of Afghanistan, generating widespread condemnation amid a global outcry.

=== Unconstitutional Kelantan Syariah Law amendment ===
Sisters in Islam had criticized PAS for unconstitutional Shariah enactment on the recent update of the Shariah law of the Kelantan penal code including:
*attempting to convert out of Islam
*distortion of Islamic teachings
*disrespecting the month of Ramadan
*destroying houses of worship
*disobeying parents
*tattooing
*undergoing plastic surgery.
This has sparked another controversy where the punishments include a jail term of not more than three years and a fine of up to RM5,000 or six strokes of the cane, and that the punishment is categorized under &quot;ta&#x27;zir&quot; (crimes with discretionary punishments) and not under hudud (Islamic Penal Code).

===Flight attendant uniform criticism===
PAS had sparked another controversy where several of its lawmakers criticised flight stewardess uniform attire they claimed that it is &quot;too revealing&quot; and added that flight stewardesses must be allowed to wear a hijab. Following those two statements, Sisters in Islam (SIS) said the issue had taken priority over other concerns somehow and they claim that ministerial directives should not interfere with a company&#x27;s policy which may subject to extra rebranding and production costs unless there were issues of safety, health and security. National Union of Flight Attendants Malaysia vice secretary-general S Shashi Kumar also publicly stated that this complaint is &quot;nonsensical&quot; when he said the &quot;baju kebaya&quot; has become a fashion statement in southeast Asia. He said, &quot;Royal Brunei Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Garuda Indonesia have adopted the baju kebaya as the uniform for their female flight attendants.&quot; Transport minister Anthony Loke had said “We are aware that this is not a new policy and there is nothing new, but there are no plans to change the existing policies on the dressing of stewards and stewardesses. The image and outfit depend on the airline company.&quot;.He added that “The Ministry has no restriction if Muslim air stewardesses choose to wear attire that is Syariah compliant as long as it fulfils the criteria set by CAAM,&quot; It looks like PAS leaders lack knowledge of the Malay heritage and criticising their traditional attire, responded the Global Human Rights Federation.

===Timah whiskey===
Following the fame of Malaysia&#x27;s local liquor company, Timah Whiskey after winning two silver medals in the Tasting Awards for the International Spirits Challenge 2020 (ISC) as well as the Annual San Francisco World Spirits Competition 2020 (SFWSC), PAS urged Ismail Sabri Yaakob&#x27;s Cabinet for the company to be shut down stating that it &quot;to prevent triggering the sensitivity of Muslims in the country&quot; and &quot;to avoid a precedent of new liquor companies emerging&quot;. PAS also states that they had to face numerous severe backlash. PAS Deputy President, Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man, said that &quot;We have always been consistent in our stance against alcohol because it is clear that it is haram according to the Quran,&quot;.

The request was denied by Ismail Sabri Yaakob&#x27;s Cabinet where they had decided to rule against the decision. Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob state that the &quot;cannot cause concern to the people in the context of race and religion&quot;.
PAS Deputy President, Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man, states &quot;For me, the &#x27; people&#x27;s anxiety &#x27; can be considered as &#x27; the confusion of the people, especially the Malay-Muslims &#x27; &quot;. Tuan Ibrahim was also reported by the media on October 19 as saying that the brand and logo of Timah whiskey &quot;can be confusing&quot; and asked for it to be reviewed.

===English language criticism===
PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang has claimed that people who advocate for the English language to be taught in Malaysia are &quot;stuck in a colonial mindset&quot;. Expanding on this point, he said such Malaysians seemed to be embarrassed to use their national language (Malay) and had placed greater importance on English. In the PAS party newspaper, Harakah Hadi wrote an article titled &quot;Ignore the delirious voices which are trying to reduce the importance of the Malay language&quot; where in it he stated that such advocates &quot;are behaving like slaves to the former colonial masters despite having been freed from their clutches&quot;. Additionally in the same article he further went on to say that &quot;advertisements in shops and the market, as well as the names of cities and roads, are named in English even though a majority of its target audience does not know English, at the same time, they do not care about whether their audiences consist of Malaysians who do not know English&quot;.

== Structure and membership ==
PAS&#x27;s general assembly (&quot;Muktamar&quot;) elects the party&#x27;s president, Deputy President, three vice presidents and a multi-member Central Working Committee. The assembly is held annually, but elections occur only once every two years. The assembly is composed mainly of delegates elected by individual local divisions of the party. The day-to-day administration of the party is carried out by its Secretary-General, a position appointed by the party&#x27;s leadership. The Central Working Committee is ostensibly the party&#x27;s principal decision-making body, although its decisions are susceptible to being overturned by the Syura Council, an unelected body composed only of Muslim clerics and led by the party&#x27;s Spiritual Leader (&quot;Musyidul &#x27;Am&quot;). The relationship between the different administrative bodies within the party occasionally causes conflict. In 2014, the Central Working Committee voted to support the nomination of Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, the President of the People&#x27;s Justice Party, to be the Chief Minister of the Pakatan Rakyat government in Selangor. Abdul Hadi Awang, as PAS&#x27;s president and with the backing of the Syura Council, overturned the decision and nominated different candidates.

The party has three recognised sub-organisations for different categories of party members: an ulama wing (the &quot;Dewan Ulama&quot;) for Muslim clerics, a women&#x27;s wing (the &quot;Dewan Muslimat&quot;) and a youth wing (the &quot;Dewan Pemuda&quot;). Each wing elects its leadership at its general assembly. There is a fourth wing for non-Muslim supporters of the party, although it does not have the same recognised position in the party&#x27;s structure as the other three wings.

PAS has approximately one million members, more than any other opposition party in Malaysia. PAS members often distinguish themselves from UMNO members through cultural and religious practices. For Islamic headwear, males who support PAS tend to prefer the white, soft &quot;kopiah&quot;, while UMNO supporters tend to wear the traditional Malay &quot;songkok&quot;, a rigid black cap. Some areas of Malaysia host rival mosques catering for the members and supporters of each party.

<text>The Matrix Online (abbreviated as MxO) is a discontinued massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) initially developed by Monolith Productions and later, a few months after launch, by Sony Online Entertainment. It was advertised as a continuation of the storyline of &quot;The Matrix&quot; films, as The Wachowskis, the franchise&#x27;s creators, gave their blessing to the notion of gamers &quot;inherit[ing] the storyline&quot;. The game began closed beta-testing in June 2004 which was then opened for people who pre-ordered the game in November 2004. Warner Bros. and Sega released &quot;MxO&quot; on March 22, 2005 in the United States. It was released in Europe on April 15, 2005. In June, Warner Bros. sold the rights to the game to Sony Online Entertainment, and the game&#x27;s development and operation was transferred to the latter on August 15, 2005. Sony Online Entertainment shut down operation of the game on July 31, 2009.

Ubisoft backed out of an agreement to co-publish the game, not long after canceling plans for another MMORPG. Ubisoft and Warner Bros. stated that this did not have a negative impact on their relationship. At the time, doubts about the game circled within the industry, based on the lackluster reception of the second and third &quot;The Matrix&quot; films and an overcrowded MMORPG market.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;, the player assumes the role of a redpill, a human who was formerly trapped inside the Matrix and has since been freed and shown the truth of humanity&#x27;s imprisonment. When creating a new character, the player is given the choice of taking a blue pill that will return them to their former life (quit the game) or a red pill, which will free their mind from the Matrix and allow them to take the body of a physical human and experience reality. Characters who are unaware of the fact that they are in the simulation are often referred to as &quot;bluepills&quot; because they have either taken the blue pill or have not been given the choice yet. People who are aware of the simulation (players) are referred to as &quot;redpills&quot; because they have taken the red pill (or, in very rare cases, when a character has self-substantiated out of the Matrix on their own). Following the choice between the two pills, the player is then taken through a basic tutorial of the game&#x27;s mechanics, including mission interaction and the combat system. After the tutorial, they are then free to roam the Mega City (the large metropolis that the entire Matrix story is set in).
===Combat===
Combat in the game is divided into two separate parts: Free-fire and Interlock. Free-fire mode allows for large gun battles to take place, while Interlock is often broken down into bullet-time-affected martial arts moves and close-quarters gunfire.

There are three main classes in &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;: Coder, Hacker, and Operative. Coders create a special &quot;simulacrum&quot; that fights for them. Hackers manipulate the code of the Matrix to affect friends and enemies from a distance, either damaging them, downgrading their combat abilities, or healing them and upgrading their powers. Operatives are the common soldiers seen from the movies - Martial Artists, Gunmen, and the new Spy class, which revolves around stealth fighting and knife throwing. Magazines never seem to run out of bullets and knife throwers also have an unlimited supply.

In free-fire mode, operatives exchange damage with each other. Gunmen and Hackers are well-equipped for this, with their ranged attacks and abilities. Martial Artists must get close to their targets to be effective, and although a Spy&#x27;s most dangerous abilities are initiated out of Interlock, they also pull their opponents into Interlock. Each attack or ability is used at timed intervals, based on the system of damage per second (D.P.S.). For example, the strongest rifle in the Matrix does 15 damage points per second and has a fire rate of 3.5 seconds, which, in free-fire, causes the rifle to have a base damage of 52.5, to be altered by the player&#x27;s own stats. Opposed to such, a Hacker&#x27;s stronger attack ability such as Logic Barrage 4.0 does 63 D.P.S., but with a short casting timer, does base damage of only 120-180 damage.

In Interlock or Close Combat, two players exchange damage in rounds. Each round lasts exactly four seconds. For each round, the two players&#x27; accuracies are pitted against each other&#x27;s defenses, which are slightly affected by a random &quot;luck&quot; roll. There are three different outcomes to a round: hit-hit, hit-miss, or miss-miss. In hit-miss, one of the players will hit the other while dodging or blocking their attack. In miss-miss, both players will parry each other without doing damage. In hit-hit, one player will damage the other, only to be damaged themselves in a counterattack. When special abilities are used, however, there can be no hit-hit round, although the miss-miss round can still apply.

When taking or dealing damage, one player&#x27;s damage influences are pitted against another player&#x27;s resistance influences of the same damage type (i.e. a gunman&#x27;s ballistic damage versus an opponent&#x27;s ballistic resistance). Higher resistance versus lower damage means that the defending player will not take as much damage.

When attacking or defending against attacks, one player&#x27;s accuracy influences are pitted against another&#x27;s defense influences of the same attack type.

There is no turn-based combat in the Matrix Online. All combat takes place in &quot;real-time&quot;, and large-scale battles are often decided by the sheer numbers of forces of one side versus others. Amassing a large number of players to control the battlefield is affectionately dubbed &quot;zerging&quot;.

Items that characters drop in the game world can be picked up, granting powers to the player that lugs them around. These are called &quot;luggables&quot;.

===Classes===
&quot;The Matrix Online&quot; has a unique class system. Players can load abilities they have either purchased or produced (by the &quot;Coder&quot; class, known in-game as &quot;coding&quot;) at &quot;Hardlines&quot;, provided they have enough memory and the abilities that precede the loading one. These abilities can then be switched out at a Hardline at a moment&#x27;s notice. This leads to a very flexible class system, without players being stuck in one class.

The three main archetypes are Hacker, Coder, and Operative. They are similar to the classes Mage, Crafter, and Fighter in other MMORPGs. These classes then branch out into sub-classes, with Coder, for example, is divided into Programmer (out of a battle item and ability maker) and Code Shaper (creates simulacrums to fight with, similarities to a necromancer/summoner in other MMOG&#x27;s). The game has a total of 21 end-game classes with an additional two stubs.

===Missions and organizations===
After an initial set of introductory missions, players can join one of three organizations working in the Matrix, each with a different set of goals, beliefs, and methods: Zion, the Machines, and the Merovingian.

In order to receive increasingly critical and sensitive missions, players are expected to run missions for their chosen organization, which will increase their standing with their chosen organization but will also lower it with the other two.

Zion/Nirvana:

Zion is the last remaining human city on Earth, hidden deep underground and is concerned chiefly with protecting its citizens from the Machines who see those who have &quot;awakened&quot; as a threat to those still connected to the Matrix. Those who choose to work for Zion usually enlist in the Zion Military and see this as the best way to protect the ideals of freedom.

Machines:

The main motivation for choosing to side with the Machines is that this organization is seen as the most conducive towards maintaining the status-quo of the Matrix and protecting the lives of those still connected to it, i.e., bluepills. However, there are also those who feel that the only way to improve relations between man and machine is to work with them as closely as possible and see joining this organization as the best way to do so.

Merovingian:

Those who work for the Merovingian are in a unique position in that they need not concern themselves with the traditional hostilities between Zion and the Machines, preferring instead to act only when the situation would prove advantageous for themselves or the organization as a whole. However, this organization has also been chosen by some players as it is the only one out of the three that fights to protect the Exiles who reside within the Matrix.

Sub-organizations:

Players cannot run missions for these organizations although in storyline terms they are now quite separate from their original &quot;parent&quot; organization, even receiving their own Live Events:

*EPN - E Pluribus Neo&quot; (Zion as parent organization)&quot;:

Members of EPN are devoted to what they deem &quot;Neo&#x27;s legacy&quot;. This mostly involves giving all human beings the opportunity to question the true nature of their &quot;reality&quot;, the Matrix, and to have the choice of the red or blue pill. Very much against the Machines, and Cypherites in particular, there are some more fundamentalist schools of thought within this organization who believe that the only solution to humanity&#x27;s problems is to free the entire human population from the Matrix. They are led by The Kid with his old friend, Shimada - who also acts as their mission controller.

*Cypherites &quot;(Machines as parent organization)&quot;:

Usually seen as the more extreme elements of the Machine organization, Cypherites follow in the footsteps of Cypher, wanting to be reinserted into the Matrix as bluepills so that they may be blissfully unaware of the true nature of the Matrix as a computer program. The name of their hovercraft, &quot;Blue Dreamer&quot;, reflects this philosophy. They are currently led by Cryptos and his second-in-command, the Zion traitor, Veil. During the time that Cryptos was revealed to be a Machine Program inhabiting a redpill&#x27;s body, Veil assumed control of the organization.

Following Chapter 11.3, the Cypherites and EPN were effectively withdrawn as playable organizations within the game. Existing factions that were granted their respective &quot;EPN/CYPH&quot; tags in their faction names continued to hold said tags unless they disbanded or reformed, but no new splinter org tags were granted. In addition, no further Live Events occurred for these organizations.

==Continuing story==

Another of &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;″s defining and differentiating aspects was its inclusion and emphasis on what was called &quot;The Continuing Story&quot;. This is to say the game itself is the official continuation of the universe, story and characters established in &quot;The Matrix&quot; series of fictional works including the film trilogy, &quot;The Animatrix&quot; short films, the &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; video game and a series of officially written and produced Matrix comic books.

This continuation was written by comic book writer Paul Chadwick. It was also confirmed as having seen verification and input from &quot;Matrix&quot; creators The Wachowskis through the end of Chapter 9.

===Progression of the storyline===

The story progressed in real time, with a planned schedule in effect that included the following:
* Nine new critical missions (three for each of the game&#x27;s three main organizations) every six weeks, released weekly as part of the game&#x27;s patch cycle.
* A new hand-drawn cinematic every six weeks to coincide with the start of a new sub-chapter.
* Daily live events.
* Large-scale organizational meetings (one each month).

====Chapter organization====

&quot;The Matrix Online&quot; used a system of organization akin to that of software versioning to keep track of its chronological progression. Each &quot;Critical&quot; mission and development is given its own unique tag within this system.

For example: Chapter 1, sub-chapter 2, week 3 would be represented as 1.2.3.

It has been stated by &quot;MxO&quot; developer Rarebit, that this numbering system was meant purely for chronological measuring and game design (for the various rewards associated with completing past critical missions in a system called The Mission Archive). The chapters and sub-chapters are not intended as self-contained units. Rather, they are each equally relevant to the unfolding of the story as a whole.

===LESIG program===

The LESIG (Live Event Special Interest Group) was originally devised under Monolith&#x27;s operation of the game to give developers insight into the player sentiment around live events, with the creation of a live events program, including the development of in-game event tools and server-specific event teams made of community members, as a long term goal.

However, when &quot;The Matrix Online&quot; moved to Sony Online Entertainment, the program underwent a radical change in direction as part of similar changes to the other story telling devices, most importantly, the scale and frequency of live events following the departure of a dedicated Live Events Team.

The group were given the new task of playing minor supporting roles (known as organization liaison officers) during future live events or even more permanent characters to enhance interaction between players, essentially replacing the paid staff of the LET with volunteer players.

==Closing==
In June 2009, Sony Online Entertainment stopped serving &quot;The Matrix Online&quot; due to low subscription numbers. The service was officially shut down on August 1, 2009. At the time, it had fewer than 500 active players.

The days leading up to the closing, as well as the end of the servers themselves, were chronicled on the gaming website Giant Bomb in a video series titled &quot;Not Like This&quot;, a reference to a line in the first of the &quot;Matrix&quot; films.

After the closing, the website remained operational for a limited period of time. Visitors were greeted with an invitation to peruse the official memory book, which had been posted as a parting gift to the fans. The book included a summary of the storyline and various nostalgic items.

==Reception==

The game received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

<doc id="376476" wikidata="Q129558" url="?curid=376476" title="Ocean current">
<text>An ocean current is a continuous, directed movement of seawater generated by a number of forces acting upon the water, including wind, the Coriolis effect, breaking waves, cabbeling, and temperature and salinity differences. Depth contours, shoreline configurations, and interactions with other currents influence a current&#x27;s direction and strength. Ocean currents move both horizontally, on scales that can span entire oceans, as well as vertically, with vertical currents (upwelling and downwelling) playing an important role in the movement of nutrients and gases, such as carbon dioxide, between the surface and the deep ocean.

Ocean currents flow for great distances and together they create the global conveyor belt, which plays a dominant role in determining the climate of many of Earth&#x27;s regions. More specifically, ocean currents influence the temperature of the regions through which they travel. For example, warm currents traveling along more temperate coasts increase the temperature of the area by warming the sea breezes that blow over them. Perhaps the most striking example is the Gulf Stream, which, together with its extension the North Atlantic Drift, makes northwest Europe much more temperate for its high latitude than other areas at the same latitude. Another example is Lima, Peru, whose cooler subtropical climate contrasts with that of its surrounding tropical latitudes because of the Humboldt Current.

The largest ocean current is the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), a wind-driven current which flows clockwise uninterrupted around Antarctica. The ACC connects all the ocean basins together, and also provides a link between the atmosphere and the deep ocean due to the way water upwells and downwells on either side of it.

Ocean currents are patterns of water movement that influence climate zones and weather patterns around the world. They are primarily driven by winds and by seawater density, although many other factors influence them – including the shape and configuration of the ocean basin they flow through. The two basic types of currents – surface and deep-water currents – help define the character and flow of ocean waters across the planet.the ocean current is divided in to two warm ocean current and cold ocean current

== Causes ==

Ocean currents are driven by the wind, by the gravitational pull of the moon in the form of tides, and by the effects of variations in water density. Ocean dynamics define and describe the motion of water within the oceans.

Ocean temperature and motion fields can be separated into three distinct layers: mixed (surface) layer, upper ocean (above the thermocline), and deep ocean. Ocean currents are measured in units of sverdrup (Sv), where 1 Sv is equivalent to a volume flow rate of per second.

There are two main types of currents, surface currents and deep water currents. Generally surface currents are driven by wind systems and deep water currents are driven by differences in water density due to variations in water temperature and salinity.

=== Wind-driven circulation ===
Surface oceanic currents are driven by wind currents, the large scale prevailing winds drive major persistent ocean currents, and seasonal or occasional winds drive currents of similar persistence to the winds that drive them, and the Coriolis effect plays a major role in their development. The Ekman spiral velocity distribution results in the currents flowing at an angle to the driving winds, and they develop typical clockwise spirals in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise rotation in the southern hemisphere.
In addition, the areas of surface ocean currents move somewhat with the seasons; this is most notable in equatorial currents.

Deep ocean basins generally have a non-symmetric surface current, in that the eastern equator-ward flowing branch is broad and diffuse whereas the pole-ward flowing western boundary current is relatively narrow.

=== Thermohaline circulation ===
Large scale currents are driven by gradients in water density, which in turn depend on variations in temperature and salinity. This thermohaline circulation is also known as the ocean&#x27;s conveyor belt. Where significant vertical movement of ocean currents is observed, this is known as upwelling and downwelling. The adjective &quot;thermohaline&quot; derives from &quot;&quot; referring to temperature and &quot;&quot; referring to salt content, factors which together determine the density of seawater.

The thermohaline circulation is a part of the large-scale ocean circulation that is driven by global density gradients created by surface heat and freshwater fluxes. Wind-driven surface currents (such as the Gulf Stream) travel polewards from the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, cooling en route, and eventually sinking at high latitudes (forming North Atlantic Deep Water). This dense water then flows into the ocean basins. While the bulk of it upwells in the Southern Ocean, the oldest waters (with a transit time of around 1000 years) upwell in the North Pacific. Extensive mixing therefore takes place between the ocean basins, reducing differences between them and making the Earth&#x27;s oceans a global system. On their journey, the water masses transport both energy (in the form of heat) and matter (solids, dissolved substances and gases) around the globe. As such, the state of the circulation has a large impact on the climate of the Earth. The thermohaline circulation is sometimes called the ocean conveyor belt, the great ocean conveyor, or the global conveyor belt. On occasion, it is imprecisely used to refer to the meridional overturning circulation, (MOC).

Since the 2000s an international program called Argo has been mapping the temperature and salinity structure of the ocean with a fleet of automated platforms that float with the ocean currents. The information gathered will help explain the role the oceans play in the earth&#x27;s climate.

== Effects on climate and ecology ==
Ocean currents affect temperatures throughout the world. For example, the ocean current that brings warm water up the north Atlantic to northwest Europe also cumulatively and slowly blocks ice from forming along the seashores, which would also block ships from entering and exiting inland waterways and seaports, hence ocean currents play a decisive role in influencing the climates of regions through which they flow. Ocean currents are important in the study of marine debris.

Upwellings and cold ocean water currents flowing from polar and sub-polar regions bring in nutrients that support plankton growth, which are crucial prey items for several key species in marine ecosystems.

Ocean currents are also important in the dispersal and distribution of many organisms, including those with pelagic egg or larval stages. An example is the life-cycle of the European Eel. Terrestrial species, for example tortoises and lizards, can be carried on floating debris by currents to colonise new terrestrial areas and islands.

== Ocean currents and climate change ==
The continued rise of atmospheric temperatures is anticipated to have various effects on the strength of surface ocean currents, wind-driven circulation and dispersal patterns. Ocean currents play a significant role in influencing climate, and shifts in climate in turn impact ocean currents.

Over the last century, reconstructed sea surface temperature data reveal that western boundary currents are heating at double the rate of the global average. These observations indicate that the western boundary currents are likely intensifying due to this change in temperature, and may continue to grow stronger in the near future. There is evidence that surface warming due to anthropogenic climate change has accelerated upper ocean currents in 77% of the global ocean. Specifically, increased vertical stratification due to surface warming intensifies upper ocean currents, while changes in horizontal density gradients caused by differential warming across different ocean regions results in the acceleration of surface zonal currents.

There are suggestions that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is in danger of collapsing due to climate change, which would have extreme impacts on the climate of northern Europe and more widely, although this topic is controversial and remains an active area of research. The &quot;State of the cryosphere&quot; report, dedicates significant space to AMOC, saying it may be en route to collapse because of ice melt and water warming. In the same time, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is also slowing down and is expected to lose 20% of it power by the year 2050, &quot;with widespread impacts on ocean circulation and climate&quot;. UNESCO mentions that the report in the first time &quot;notes a growing scientific consensus that melting Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, among other factors, may be slowing important ocean currents at both poles, with potentially dire consequences for a much colder northern Europe and greater sea-level rise along the U.S. East Coast.&quot;

In addition to water surface temperatures, the wind systems are a crucial determinant of ocean currents. Wind wave systems influence oceanic heat exchange, the condition of the sea surface, and can alter ocean currents. In the North Atlantic, equatorial Pacific, and Southern Ocean, increased wind speeds as well as significant wave heights have been attributed to climate change and natural processes combined. In the East Australian Current, global warming has also been accredited to increased wind stress curl, which intensifies these currents, and may even indirectly increase sea levels, due to the additional warming created by stronger currents.

As ocean circulation changes due to climate, typical distribution patterns are also changing. The dispersal patterns of marine organisms depend on oceanographic conditions, which as a result, influence the biological composition of oceans. Due to the patchiness of the natural ecological world, dispersal is a species survival mechanism for various organisms. With strengthened boundary currents moving toward the poles, it is expected that some marine species will be redirected to the poles and greater depths. The strengthening or weakening of typical dispersal pathways by increased temperatures are expected to not only impact the survival of native marine species due to inability to replenish their meta populations but also may increase the prevalence of invasive species. In Japanese corals and macroalgae, the unusual dispersal pattern of organisms toward the poles may destabilize native species.

== Economic importance ==
Knowledge of surface ocean currents is essential in reducing costs of shipping, since traveling with them reduces fuel costs. In the wind powered sailing-ship era, knowledge of wind patterns and ocean currents was even more essential. Using ocean currents to help their ships into harbor and using currents such as the gulf stream to get back home. The lack of understanding of ocean currents during that time period is hypothesized to be one of the contributing factors to exploration failure. The Gulf Stream and the Canary current keep western European countries warmer and less variable, while at the same latitude North America&#x27;s weather was colder. A good example of this is the Agulhas Current (down along eastern Africa), which long prevented sailors from reaching India.

In recent times, around-the-world sailing competitors make good use of surface currents to build and maintain speed.
Ocean currents can also be used for marine power generation, with areas of Japan, Florida and Hawaii being considered for test projects. The utilization of currents today can still impact global trade, it can reduce the cost and emissions of shipping vessels. 

Ocean currents can also impact the fishing industry, examples of this include the Tsugaru, Oyashio and Kuroshio currents all of which influence the western North Pacific temperature, which has been shown to be a habitat predictor for the Skipjack tuna. It has also been shown that it is not just local currents that can affect a country&#x27;s economy, but neighboring currents can influence the viability of local fishing industries.

<doc id="376485" wikidata="Q467840" url="?curid=376485" title="Cube (1997 film)">
<text>Cube is a 1997 Canadian science fiction horror film directed and co-written by Vincenzo Natali. A product of the Canadian Film Centre&#x27;s First Feature Project, Nicole de Boer, Nicky Guadagni, David Hewlett, Andrew Miller, Julian Richings, Wayne Robson, and Maurice Dean Wint star as seven individuals trapped in a bizarre and deadly labyrinth of cube-shaped rooms.

&quot;Cube&quot; gained notoriety and a cult following for its surreal and Kafkaesque setting in industrial, cube-shaped rooms. It received generally positive reviews and led to a series of films. A Japanese remake was released in 2021.

==Plot==

A man named Alderson awakens in a room that has hatches on each wall and floor, each leading to other rooms. He enters another room, and is killed by a trap.

Five different people all meet in another room: men Quentin, Rennes, and Worth, and women Leaven and Holloway. Quentin warns the group that he has seen traps in some of the other rooms. Leaven notices each hatch has plates with three sets of numbers etched into them. Rennes tests his theory that each trap could be triggered by detectors by throwing his boot into a room, and started moving through the safe rooms. This works for motion detectors and pressure sensors, but fails to trigger the trap in one of the rooms and he is killed by an acid trap. 

Quentin believes each person was chosen to be there. Leaven hypothesizes that rooms whose plates contain prime numbers are trapped. They encounter a mentally disabled man named Kazan, whom Holloway insists be brought along. Tension rises among the group, as well as the mystery of the maze&#x27;s purpose. Worth admits to Quentin he was hired to design the maze’s shell and guesses that The Cube was created accidentally by a bureaucracy, and that its original purpose has been forgotten and that they have only been placed inside to justify its existence.

Worth&#x27;s knowledge of the exterior dimensions allows Leaven to calculate that the Cube has 17,576 rooms, plus a &quot;bridge&quot; room that would connect to the shell, and thus, the exit. She realizes that the numbers may indicate each room&#x27;s coordinates. The group travels to the edge but realize every room there is trapped. They successfully traverse a room with a trap. Holloway defends Kazan from Quentin&#x27;s threats.

The group reaches the edge, but can see no exit. Holloway tries to swing over to the shell using a rope made of clothing. The Cube shakes, causing the rope to slip; Quentin catches it at the last second and pulls her up, but then deliberately drops her to her death, telling the others that she slipped.

Quentin picks up Leaven and carries her to a different room in her sleep, intending to abandon Kazan and Worth. He tries to assault her, but Worth follows and attacks him. Quentin counters savagely, then throws Worth down a hatch to a different room. Upon landing, Worth starts laughing hysterically; Rennes&#x27; corpse is in the room, proving they have moved in a circle. Quentin is horrified, but Worth realizes the room Rennes died in has now moved to the edge of the maze, meaning they haven&#x27;t gone in a circle at all. Instead, the rooms are moving, and will eventually line up with the exit. Leaven deduces that traps are not tagged by prime numbers, but by powers of prime numbers. Kazan is revealed as an autistic savant who can calculate factorizations in his head instantaneously. Leaven and Kazan guide the group through the cube to the bridge. Worth then traps Quentin in a hatch. He catches up and attempts to attack them, but Worth opens a hatch under him from the room below. All but Quentin travel to the bridge where they open the hatch, revealing a bright light.

Quentin reappears and severely injures Leaven with a lever. Worth attacks Quentin, who wounds him in the struggle and pursues Kazan to the exit. Worth grabs Quentin&#x27;s legs, keeping him trapped in the doorway. The bridge moves, killing Quentin. Worth crawls to a deceased Leaven to stay by her side, as Kazan wanders out into the light.

== Cast ==
The cast is of Canadian actors who were relatively unknown in the United States at the time of the film&#x27;s release. Each character&#x27;s name is connected with a real-world prison: Quentin (San Quentin, California), Holloway (UK), Kazan (Russia), Rennes (France), Alderson (Alderson, West Virginia), Leaven &amp; Worth (Leavenworth, Kansas).

* Andrew Miller as Kazan, an autistic savant and mental calculator
* David Hewlett as David Worth, an office worker and unwitting designer of the Cube&#x27;s outer shell
* Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin McNeil, a police officer who aggressively takes charge
* Nicole de Boer as Joan Leaven, a young mathematics student
* Nicky Guadagni as Dr. Helen Holloway, a free clinic doctor and conspiracy theorist
* Wayne Robson as Rennes, an escape artist who has broken out of seven prisons
* Julian Richings as Alderson, the first killed in the Cube and the only one not to meet the others

On casting Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin, Natali&#x27;s cost-centric approach sought an actor for a split-personality role of hero and villain. Wint was considered the standout among the cast and was confident that the film would be a breakthrough for the Canadian Film Centre.

==Development==
===Pre-production===
Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Lifeboat&quot;, which was shot entirely in a lifeboat with no actor standing at any point, was reportedly an inspiration for the film.

Director Vincenzo Natali did not have confidence in financing a film. He cost-reduced his pitch with a single set reused as many times as possible, with the actors moving around a virtual maze. As the most expensive element, a set with a cube and a half was built off the floor, to allow the surroundings to be lit from behind all walls of the cube. In 1990, Natali had had the idea to make a film &quot;set entirely in hell&quot;, but in 1994 while working as a storyboard artist&#x27;s assistant at Canada&#x27;s Nelvana animation studio, he completed the first script for &quot;Cube&quot;. The initial draft had a more comedic tone, surreal images, a cannibal, edible moss growing on the walls, and a monster that roamed the Cube. Roommate and childhood filmmaking partner Andre Bijelic helped Natali strip the central idea to its essence of people avoiding deadly traps in a maze. Scenes outside the cube were deleted, and the identity of the victims changed. In some drafts, they were accountants and in others criminals, with the implication that their banishment to the Cube was part of a penal sentence. One of the most important dramatic changes was the removal of food and water for a more urgent escape.

After writing &quot;Cube&quot;, Natali developed the short film &quot;Elevated&quot;. It is set in an elevator to show investors how &quot;Cube&quot; would hypothetically look and feel. Cinematographer Derek Rogers developed strategies for shooting in the tightly confined elevator, which he later reused on a Toronto soundstage for &quot;Cube&quot;.

Casting started with Natali&#x27;s friends, and budget limitations allowed for only one day of script reading prior to shooting. As it was filmed relatively quickly with well prepared actors, there are no known outtake clips.

===Filming===
The film was shot in Toronto, Ontario in 21 days, with 50% of the budget as C$350,000 to C$375,000 in cash and the other 50% as donated services, for a total of C$700,000. Natali considered the cash figure to be deceptive, because they deferred payment on goods and services, and got the special effects at no cost.

The set&#x27;s warehouse was near a train line, and its noise was incorporated into the film as that of the cubes moving. To change the look of each room, some scenes were shot with wide lens, and others are long lens and lit with different colors, for the illusion of traversing a maze. Nicole de Boer said that the white room was more comforting to actors at the start of a day&#x27;s filming, compared to the red room which induced psychological effects on the cast during several hours in the confined space.

Only one cube set was actually built, with each of its sides measuring in length, with only one working door that could actually support the weight of the actors. The colour of the room was changed by sliding panels. This time-consuming procedure determined that the film was not shot in sequence, and all shots taking place in rooms of a specific color were shot separately. Six colors of rooms were intended to match the recurring theme of six throughout the film; five sets of gel panels, plus pure white. However, the budget did not stretch to the sixth gel panel, and so the film has only five room colors. Another partial cube was made for shots requiring the point of view of standing in one room and looking into another.

The small set created technical problems for hosting a 30-person crew and a 6-person cast, becoming &quot;a weird fusion between sci-fi and the guerrilla-style approach to filmmaking&quot;.

===Mathematic accuracy===
The Cube was conceived by mathematician David W. Pravica, who was the math consultant. It consists of an outer cubical shell or sarcophagus, and the inner cube rooms. Each side of the outer shell is long. The inner cube consists of 263 = 17,576 cubical rooms (minus an unknown number of rooms to allow for movement), each having a side length of . A space of is between the inner cube and the outer shell. Each room is labelled with three identification numbers such as &quot;517 478 565&quot;. These numbers encode the starting coordinates of the room, and the X, Y, and Z coordinates are the sums of the digits of the first, second, and third number, respectively. The numbers also determine the movement of the room. The subsequent positions are obtained by cyclically subtracting the digits from one another, and the resulting numbers are then successively added to the starting numbers.

===Post-production===
During post-production, Natali spent months &quot;on the aural environment&quot;, including appropriate sound effects of each room, so the &quot;Cube&quot; could feel like what he described as a haunted house.

==Release==
&quot;Cube&quot; was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September 1997 and released in Ottawa and Montreal on 18 September 1998. A theatrical release occurred in Spain in early 1999, while in Italy a release was scheduled for July 1999 and an opening in Germany was set for later that year. In the Japanese market, it became the top video rental at the time, and exceeded expectations, with co-writer Graeme Manson suggesting people in Japan had a better understanding of living in boxes so resonated better with the Japanese audience, as they were likely &quot;more receptive to the whole metaphor underlying the film&quot;.

The film&#x27;s television debut in the United States was on 24 July 1999 on the Sci-Fi channel.

In 2023, the film was one of 23 titles that were digitally restored under its new Canadian Cinema Reignited program to preserve classic Canadian films.

A 4K restoration of the film debuted at the 28th Fantasia International Film Festival on July 30, 2024.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In its home country of Canada, the film was a commercial failure, lasting only a few days in Canadian theatres. French film distributor Samuel Hadida&#x27;s company Metropolitan Filmexport saw potential in the film and spent $1.2 million in a marketing campaign, posting flyers in many cities and flying members of the cast over to France to meet moviegoers. At its peak, the film was shown at 220 French box offices and became among the most popular films in France of that time, collecting over $10 million in box office receipts. It went on to be the second-highest-grossing film in France that summer.

Elsewhere internationally, the film grossed $501,818 in the United States, and $8,479,845 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $8,981,663.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Cube&quot; holds an approval rating of 63%, based on 40 reviews, and an average rating of 6.3/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Cube&quot; sometimes struggles with where to take its intriguing premise, but gripping pace and an impressive intelligence make it hard to turn away&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score 61 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Bob Graham of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; was highly critical: &quot;If writer-director Vincenzo Natali, storyboard artist for Keanu Reeves&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, were as comfortable with dialogue and dramatizing characters as he is with images, this first feature of his might have worked better&quot;. Nick Schager from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; rated the film three out of five stars, noting that, its intriguing premise and initially chilling mood were undone by threadbare characterizations, and lack of a satisfying explanation for the cube&#x27;s existence. He concluded the film &quot;winds up going nowhere fast&quot;.

Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was more positive, saying the story &quot;proves surprisingly gripping, in the best &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; tradition. The ensemble cast does an outstanding job on the cinematic equivalent of a bare stage... Everyone has his or her own theory about who is behind this peculiar imprisonment... The weakness in &quot;Cube&quot; is the dialogue, which sometimes turns remarkably trite... The strength is the film&#x27;s understated but real tension. Vincenzo Natali, the film&#x27;s fledgling director and co-writer, has delivered an allegory, too, about futility, about the necessity and certain betrayal of trust, about human beings who do not for a second have the luxury of doing nothing&quot;. Bloody Disgusting gave a positive review: &quot;Shoddy acting and a semi-weak script can&#x27;t hold this movie back. It&#x27;s simply too good a premise and too well-directed to let minor hindrances derail its creepy premise&quot;. Kim Newman from Empire Online gave the film 4/5 stars, writing: &quot;Too many low-budget sci-fi films try for epic scope and fail; this one concentrates on making the best of what it&#x27;s got and does it well&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film won the award for Best Canadian First Feature Film at the 1997 Toronto International Film Festival and the Jury Award at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film.

In 2001, an industry poll conducted by &quot;Playback&quot; named it the eighth best Canadian film of the preceding 15 years.

The film, and its concept of prisoners in identical rooms riddled with traps, is referenced in Liu Cixin&#x27;s acclaimed in 2008 novel, &quot;The Dark Forest&quot;, which is itself the sequel to Liu&#x27;s prior Hugo Award winning novel, &quot;The Three Body Problem&quot;, and is the name source of the &quot;Dark Forest Hypothesis&quot; response to to the Fermi Paradox concerning extraterrestrial life and Game Theory.
==Series and remakes==

After &quot;Cube&quot; achieved cult status, it was followed by a sequel, &quot;Cube 2: Hypercube&quot;, released in 2002, and a prequel, &quot;Cube Zero&quot;, released in 2004.

In April 2015, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that Lionsgate Films was planning to remake the film, titled &quot;Cubed&quot;, with Saman Kesh directing, Roy Lee and Jon Spaihts producing, and a screenplay by Philip Gawthorne, based on Kesh’s original take.

A Japanese remake, also called &quot;Cube&quot;, was released in October 2021.

<doc id="376486" wikidata="Q1333274" url="?curid=376486" title="Halt and Catch Fire (computing)">
<text>In computer engineering, Halt and Catch Fire, known by the assembly language mnemonic HCF, is an idiom referring to a computer machine code instruction that causes the computer&#x27;s central processing unit (CPU) to cease meaningful operation, typically requiring a restart of the computer. It originally referred to a fictitious instruction in IBM System/360 computers (introduced in 1964), making a joke about its numerous non-obvious instruction mnemonics.

With the advent of the MC6800 (introduced in 1974), a design flaw was discovered by programmers. Due to incomplete opcode decoding, two illegal opcodes, 0x9D and 0xDD, will cause the program counter on the processor to increment endlessly, which locks the processor until reset. Those codes have been unofficially named HCF. During the design process of the MC6802, engineers originally planned to remove this instruction, but kept it as-is for testing purposes. As a result, HCF was officially recognized as a real instruction. Later, HCF became a humorous catch-all term for instructions that may freeze a processor, including intentional instructions for testing purposes, and unintentional illegal instructions. Some are considered hardware defects, and if the system is shared, a malicious user can execute them to launch a denial-of-service attack.

In the case of real instructions, the implication of this expression is that, whereas in most cases in which a CPU executes an unintended instruction (a bug in the code) the computer may still be able to recover, in the case of an HCF instruction there is, by definition, no way for the system to recover without a restart.

The expression &quot;catch fire&quot; is a facetious exaggeration of the speed with which the CPU chip would be switching some bus circuits, purportedly causing them to overheat and burn.

== Origins ==
The Z1 (1938) and Z3 (1941) computers built by Konrad Zuse contained illegal sequences of instructions which damaged the hardware if executed by accident.

Apocryphal stories connect this term with an illegal opcode in IBM System/360. A processor, upon encountering the instruction, would start switching bus lines very fast, potentially leading to overheating.

In a computer&#x27;s assembly language, mnemonics are used that are directly equivalent to machine code instructions. The mnemonics are frequently three letters long, such as ADD, CMP (to compare two numbers), and JMP (jump to a different location in the program). The HCF instruction was originally a fictitious assembly language instruction, said to be under development at IBM for use in their System/360 computers, along with many other amusing three-letter acronyms like XPR (Execute Programmer) and CAI (Corrupt Accounting Information), and similar to other joke mnemonics such as &quot;SDI&quot; for &quot;Self Destruct Immediately&quot; and &quot;CRN&quot; for &quot;Convert to Roman Numerals&quot;. A list of such mnemonics, including HCF, shows up as &quot;Overextended Mnemonics&quot; in the April 1980 &quot;Creative Computing&quot; flip-side parody issue.

== In modern CPUs ==
CPU designers sometimes incorporate one or more undocumented machine code instructions for testing purposes, such as the IBM System/360 DIAGnose instruction.

=== Motorola 6800 ===
The Motorola 6800 microprocessor was the first for which an undocumented assembly mnemonic HCF became widely known. The operation codes (opcodes—the portions of the machine language instructions that specify an operation to be performed) hexadecimal 9D and DD were reported and given the unofficial mnemonic HCF in a December 1977 article by Gerry Wheeler in &quot;BYTE&quot; magazine on undocumented opcodes. Wheeler noted that Motorola reported 197 valid operation codes for the M6800 processor, and so inferred that with 256 possible 8 bit combinations, there must be 59 invalid instructions. He described the HCF as a &quot;big surprise&quot;, and said of the Catch Fire portion of the moniker, &quot;Well, almost&quot;:

Another author wrote in 2002:

The 6800&#x27;s behavior when encountering HCF was known to Motorola by 1976. When the 6800 encounters the HCF instruction, the processor never finds the end of it, endlessly incrementing its program counter until the CPU is reset. Hence, the address bus effectively becomes a counter, allowing the operation of all address lines to be quickly verified. Once the processor entered this mode, it is not responsive to interrupts, so normal operation can only be restored by a reset (hence the &quot;Drop Dead&quot; and &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot; monikers). These references are thus to the unresponsive behavior of the CPU in this state, and not to any form of erratic behavior.. Motorola kept the HCF behavior in the 6802 variant of the processor (which released in 1977) as an intentional self-test for the 6802&#x27;s 128 bytes of onboard RAM.

Other HCF-like instructions were found later on the Motorola 6800 when executing undocumented opcodes FD (cycling twice slower than 9D/DD) or CD/ED (cycling at a human-readable very low frequency on a limited number of high-address lines).

HCF is believed to be the first built-in self-test feature on a Motorola microprocessor.

=== Intel x86 ===
The Intel 8086 and subsequent processors in the x86 series have an HLT (halt) instruction, opcode F4, which stops instruction execution and places the processor in a HALT state. An enabled interrupt, a debug exception, the BINIT signal, the INIT signal, or the RESET signal resumes execution, which means the processor can always be restarted. Some of the early Intel DX4 chips have a problem with the HLT instruction and cannot be restarted after this instruction is used, which disables the computer and turns HLT into more of an HCF instruction. The Linux kernel has a &quot;no-hlt&quot; option telling Linux to run an infinite loop instead of using HLT, which allows users of these broken chips to use Linux.

The 80286 has the undocumented opcode 0F 04, causing the CPU to hang when executed. The only way out is a CPU reset. In some implementations, the opcode is emulated through BIOS as a halting sequence.

Many computers in the Intel Pentium line can be locked up by executing an invalid instruction (F00F C7C8), which causes the computer to lock up. This became known as the Pentium F00F bug. No compiler creates the instruction, but a malicious programmer can insert it into code to render an afflicted computer inoperable until the machine is power-cycled. Since its discovery, workarounds have been developed to prevent it from locking the computer, and the bug has been eliminated in subsequent Intel processors.

During Black Hat USA 2017, Christopher Domas showed that he found a new &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot; instruction on an undisclosed x86 processor model using his own x86 processor fuzzer called sandsifter.

=== Other CPUs ===
The NMOS MOS Technology 6502 has 12 invalid instructions which cause the program counter to fail to fetch the next instruction, locking up the CPU and requiring a processor reset.  The WDC version of the CMOS 65C02, as well as the 65C816, has the codice_1 (stop, opcode codice_2) instruction.  When executed, codice_1 will stop the processor&#x27;s internal clock, causing all processing to cease—also, the processor will be unresponsive to all inputs except codice_4 (reset).  The only way to clear the effects of an codice_1 instruction is to toggle codice_4.

On the Zilog Z80, executing DI (disable interrupts) followed by HALT (wait for an interrupt) results in the CPU staying frozen indefinitely, waiting for an interrupt that cannot happen. However, the non-maskable interrupt signal can be used to break out of this state, making this pair not a true HCF. The /NMI signal is on Pin 17 of the original 40 pin DIP package. The pair will only result in a HCF condition if either the /NMI pin is connected directly to the +5V rail, making the generation of that signal impossible, or if the interrupt routine that services /NMI ends with a return, placing it back in the HALT state.

The SM83 processor core in the Game Boy&#x27;s LR35902 system on chip has a similar issue, triggered by two consecutive HALTs with interrupts disabled. The core itself contains 11 opcodes that fully lock the CPU when executed.

The Hitachi SC61860, mainly used in Sharp pocket computers in the 1980s and 1990s, has an undocumented HCF instruction with the opcode 7B.

<doc id="376503" wikidata="Q334999" url="?curid=376503" title="John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet John Arbuthnot Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher, (25 January 1841 – 10 July 1920), commonly known as Jacky or Jackie Fisher, was a British Admiral of the Fleet. With more than sixty years in the Royal Navy, his efforts to reform the service helped to usher in an era of modernisation which saw the supersession of wooden sailing ships armed with muzzle-loading cannon by steel-hulled battlecruisers, submarines and the first aircraft carriers.

Fisher has a reputation as an innovator, strategist and developer of the navy rather than as a seagoing admiral involved in major battles, although in his career he experienced all these things. When appointed First Sea Lord in 1904 he removed 150 ships then on active service which were no longer useful and set about constructing modern replacements, developing a modern fleet prepared to meet Germany during the First World War.

Fisher saw the need to improve the range, accuracy and rate-of-fire of naval gunnery, and became an early proponent of the use of the torpedo, which he believed would supersede big guns for use against ships. As Controller, he introduced torpedo-boat destroyers as a class of ship intended for defence against attack from torpedo boats or from submarines. As First Sea Lord he drove the construction of , the first all-big-gun battleship, but he also believed that submarines would become increasingly important and urged their development. He became involved with the introduction of turbine engines to replace reciprocating engines, and with the introduction of oil fuelling to replace coal. He introduced daily baked bread on board ships, whereas when he entered the service it was customary to eat hard biscuits, frequently infested by biscuit beetles.

He first officially retired from the Admiralty in 1910 on his 69th birthday, but became First Sea Lord again in November 1914. He resigned seven months later in frustration over Churchill&#x27;s Gallipoli campaign, and then served as chairman of the Government&#x27;s Board of Invention and Research until the end of the war.

==Character and appearance==
Fisher was five feet seven inches tall and stocky with a round face. In later years, some suggested that Fisher, born in Ceylon of British parents, had Asian ancestry due to his features and the yellow cast of his skin. However, his colour resulted from dysentery and malaria in middle life, which nearly caused his death. He had a fixed and compelling gaze when addressing someone, which gave little clue to his feelings. Fisher was energetic, ambitious, enthusiastic and clever. A shipmate described him as &quot;easily the most interesting midshipman I ever met&quot;. When addressing someone he could become carried away with the point he was seeking to make, and on one occasion, the King asked him to stop shaking his fist in his face. He was considered a &quot;man who demanded to be heard, and one who didn&#x27;t suffer fools lightly&quot;.

Throughout his life he was a religious man and attended church regularly when ashore. He had a passion for sermons and might attend two or three services in a day to hear them, which he would &#x27;discuss afterwards with great animation&#x27;. However, he was discreet in expressing his religious views because he feared public attention might hinder his professional career.

He was not keen on sport, but he was a highly proficient dancer. Fisher employed his dancing skill later in life to charm a number of important ladies. He became interested in dancing in 1877 and insisted that the officers of his ship learn to dance. Fisher cancelled the leave of midshipmen who would not take part. He introduced the practice of junior officers dancing on deck when the band was playing for senior officers&#x27; wardroom dinners. This practice spread through the fleet. He broke with the then ball tradition of dancing with a different partner for each dance, instead adopting the scandalous habit of choosing one good dancer as his partner for the evening. His ability to charm all comers of all social classes made up for his sometimes blunt or tactless comments. He suffered from seasickness throughout his life.

Fisher&#x27;s aim was &#x27;efficiency of the fleet and its instant readiness for war&#x27;, which won him support amongst a certain kind of navy officer. He believed in advancing the most able, rather than the longest serving. This upset those he passed over. Thus, he divided the navy into those who approved of his innovations and those who did not. As he became older and more senior he also became more autocratic and commented, &#x27;Anyone who opposes me, I crush&#x27;. He believed that nations fought wars for material gain, and that maintaining a strong navy deterred other nations from engaging it in battle, thus decreasing the likelihood of war: &quot;On the British fleet rests the British Empire.&quot; Fisher also believed that the risk of catastrophe in a sea battle was far greater than on land: a war could be lost or won in a day at sea, with no hope of replacing lost ships, but an army could be rebuilt quickly. When an arms race broke out between Germany and Britain to build larger navies, Kaiser Wilhelm II commented, &#x27;I admire Fisher, I say nothing against him. If I were in his place I should do all that he has done and I should do all that I know he has in mind to do&#x27;.

==Childhood and personal life==
John Arbuthnot Fisher was born on 25 January 1841 on the Wavendon Estate at Ramboda in Ceylon. He was the eldest of eleven children, of whom only seven survived infancy, born to Sophia Fisher and Captain William Fisher, a British Army officer in the 78th Highlanders, who had been an aide-de-camp to the former governor of Ceylon, Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton, and was serving as a staff officer at Kandy. Sophia&#x27;s father Alfred Lambe was a wine merchant and Purveyor of Mineral Water to the King. She was brought up New Bond Street in Mayfair, London. Fisher commented, &quot;My mother was a most magnificent and handsome, extremely young woman...My father was 6 feet 2 inches..., also especially handsome. Why I am ugly is one of those puzzles of physiology which are beyond finding out&quot;.

William Fisher sold his commission the year John was born, and became a coffee planter and later chief superintendent of police. He incurred such debt on his two coffee plantations that he could barely support his growing family. At the age of six John (who was always known within the family as &quot;Jack&quot;) was sent to England to live with his maternal grandfather, Alfred Lambe, in London. His grandfather had also lost money and the family survived by renting out rooms in their home. John&#x27;s younger brother, Frederic William Fisher, joined the Royal Navy and reached the rank of admiral, and his youngest surviving sibling Philip became a navy lieutenant on before drowning in an 1880 storm.

William Fisher was killed in a riding accident on 5 May 1866 when John was 25. John&#x27;s relationship with his mother Sophia suffered from their separation. However, he continued to send her an allowance until her death. In 1870, when Sophia suggested a visit, Fisher dissuaded her as strongly as he could. Fisher wrote to his wife: &quot;I heard from my mother... She contemplates coming to see me... I am in a horrid fright of my mother turning up some day unexpectedly; I am sure we couldn&#x27;t live together. I hate the very thought of it and really, I don&#x27;t want to see her. I don&#x27;t see why I should as I haven&#x27;t the slightest recollection of her.&quot;

Fisher married Frances Katharine Josepha Broughton, known as &#x27;Kitty&#x27;, the daughter of the Rev. Thomas Delves Broughton and Frances Corkran, on 4 April 1866 while stationed at Portsmouth. Kitty&#x27;s two brothers were both naval officers. According to a cousin, she believed that Jack would rise &quot;to the top of the tree.&quot; They remained married until her death in July 1918. They had a son, Cecil Vavasseur, 2nd Baron Fisher (1868–1955), and three daughters, Beatrix Alice (1867–1930), Dorothy Sybil (1873–1962), and Pamela Mary (1876–1949), all of whom married naval officers who went on to become admirals. Beatrix Alice married Reginald Rundell Neeld in 1896, Pamela Mary married Henry Blackett in 1906, and in 1908 Dorothy Sybil married Eric Fullerton.

==Early career (1854–1869)==

Fisher&#x27;s father ultimately aided his entry into the navy, via his godmother Lady Horton, widow of the governor of Ceylon to whom William Fisher had been Aide-de-camp. She prevailed upon a neighbour, Admiral Sir William Parker (the last of Nelson&#x27;s captains), to nominate John as a naval cadet. The entry examination consisted of writing out the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and jumping naked over a chair. He formally entered the Royal Navy on 13 July 1854, aged 13, on board Nelson&#x27;s former flagship, , at Portsmouth. On 29 July he joined , an old ship of the line. She was built of wood, in 1831, with 84 smooth-bore muzzle-loading guns arranged on two gun decks, and relied entirely on sail for propulsion. She had a crew of 700, and discipline was strictly enforced by the &quot;hard-bitten Captain Robert Stopford&quot;. Fisher fainted when he witnessed eight men being flogged on his first day.

&quot;Calcutta&quot; participated in the blockade of Russian ports in the Gulf of Finland during the Crimean War, entitling Fisher to the Baltic Medal, before returning to Britain a few months later. The crew was paid off on 1 March 1856.

On 2 March 1856, Fisher was posted to , and was sent to Constantinople (now Istanbul) to join her. He arrived on 19 May, just as the war was ending. After a tour around the Dardanelles picking up troops and baggage, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; returned to England, where the crew was paid off.

Promotion to midshipman came on 12 July 1856 and Fisher joined a 21-gun steam corvette, , part of the China Station. He was to spend the next five years in Chinese waters, seeing action in the Second Opium War, 1856–1860. The &quot;Highflyer&#x27;s&quot; captain, Charles Shadwell, was an expert on naval astronomy (subsequently being appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1861) and he taught Fisher much about navigation, with spectacular later results. When Shadwell was replaced as captain following an injury in action, he gave Fisher a pair of studs engraved with his family motto &#x27;Loyal au Mort&#x27;, which Fisher was to use for the rest of his life.

Fisher passed the seamanship examination for the rank of lieutenant, and was given the acting rank of mate, on his nineteenth birthday, 25 January 1860. He was transferred three months later from the steam frigate to the screw corvette as an acting lieutenant. Shortly afterwards, Fisher had his first brief command: taking the yacht of the China Squadron&#x27;s admiral—the paddle-gunboat —from Hong Kong to Canton (presently Guangzhou), a voyage of four days.
He was transferred, on 12 June 1860, to the paddle-sloop where he saw sufficient action to add the Taku Forts and Canton clasps to his China War Medal. &quot;Furious&quot; left Hong Kong and the China Station in March 1861 and, after a leisurely voyage home, paid off her crew in Portsmouth on 30 August. Captain Oliver Jones of the &quot;Furious&quot; was entirely different from Shadwell: Fisher wrote there was a mutiny on board within his first fortnight, that Jones terrorized his crew and disobeyed orders given to him. For his part, by the end of the tour, Jones was impressed by Fisher.

At the end of November 1861, Fisher sat his final lieutenant&#x27;s examination in navigation at the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth, passing with flying colours. He had already received top grades in seamanship and gunnery, and achieved the highest score then attained under the recently introduced five-yearly scheme, with 963 out of 1,000 marks in navigation. For this, he was awarded the Beaufort Testimonial, an annual prize of books and instruments; but in the meantime he had to wait around, unpaid, until his appointment came through officially.

From January 1862 to March 1863, Fisher returned to the payroll at the navy&#x27;s principal gunnery school aboard , a three-decker moored in Portsmouth harbour. During this time, &quot;Excellent&quot; was evaluating the performance of the &quot;revolutionary&quot; Armstrong breech-loading guns against the conventional Whitworth muzzle-loading type. During free afternoons Fisher would walk the downs, shouting to practice his command voice. He spent 15 of the next 25 years in four tours of duty at Portsmouth concerned with development of gunnery and torpedoes.

In March 1863, Fisher was appointed Gunnery Lieutenant to , the first all-iron seagoing armoured battleship and the most powerful ship in the fleet. Built in 1859, she marked the beginning of the end of the Age of Sail and, coincidentally, was armed with both Armstrong guns (breech-loading) and Whitworth rifles (muzzle-loading). Fisher noted he was popular amongst his brother officers because he frequently stayed on board when others went ashore and could take duty for them.

Fisher returned to &quot;Excellent&quot; in 1864 as a gunnery instructor, where he remained until 1869. Towards the end of his posting he became interested in torpedoes, which were invented in the 1860s, and championed their cause as a relatively simple weapon capable of sinking a battleship. His expertise with torpedoes led to his being invited to Germany in June 1869 for the founding ceremony of a new naval base at Wilhelmshaven, where he met King William I of Prussia (soon to become German emperor), Bismarck and Moltke. Perhaps inspired by the visit, he started preparing a paper on the design, construction and management of electrical torpedoes, the cutting-edge technology of the time.

==Commander (1869–1876)==

On 2 August 1869 Fisher was promoted to the rank of commander, &quot;at the early age of twenty-eight&quot; according to biographer Ruddock Mackay. On 8 November, he was posted as second-in-command of , serving under Captain Hewett, a Crimean War Victoria Cross holder. &quot;Donegal&quot; was a , with auxiliary screw propulsion. She plied between Portsmouth and Hong Kong, taking out relief crews and bringing home the crews they replaced. During this time he completed his torpedoes treatise.

In May 1870, Fisher transferred, again as second in command, to , flagship of the China Station. It was whilst he was on &quot;Ocean&quot; that he wrote an eight-page memoir: &quot;Naval Tactics&quot;, which Captain J. G. Goodenough had printed for private circulation. He installed a system of electrical firing so that all guns could be fired simultaneously, making &quot;Ocean&quot; the first vessel to be so equipped. Fisher noted in his letters that he greatly missed his wife, but also missed his work on torpedoes and the access to important people possible with a posting in England.

In 1872, he returned to England to the gunnery school &quot;Excellent&quot;, this time as head of torpedo and mine training, during which time he split the Torpedo Branch off from &quot;Excellent&quot;, forming a separate establishment for it called . His duties included lecturing, and negotiating the purchase of the navy&#x27;s first Whitehead torpedo. In order to promote the school, he invited politicians and journalists to attend lectures and organised demonstrations. This produced mixed reactions amongst some officers, who did not approve of his showmanship. He was promoted to captain on 30 October 1874, aged thirty-three, in time to be &quot;Vernon&quot;″s first commander. &quot;Vernon&quot; consisted of the hulk of , William Symonds&#x27; 1832 50-gun sailing frigate, and the hulk of the 26-gun steam frigate provided accommodation. , a torpedo boat of 245 tons, was &quot;Vernon&#x27;s&quot; experimental tender for the conduct of torpedo trials. They were moored in Portsmouth Harbour. In 1876, Fisher served on the Board of Admiralty&#x27;s torpedo committee.

==Captain R.N. (1876–1883)==
* September 1876 – March 1877: On half-pay with his family.
* 30 January 1877 – 1 March 1877: Commanding .

Fisher was appointed to command as flag captain to the Admiral of the North America and West Indies Station, Astley Cooper Key, from 2 March 1877 to 4 June 1878. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; had been in the dockyard for repairs, so the new crew was less than perfect in carrying out their duties. Fisher told them &quot;I intend to give you hell for three months, and if you have not come up to my standard in that time you&#x27;ll have hell for another three months.&quot; Midshipman (later Admiral) Gordon Moore recalled, &quot;Fisher was a very exacting master and I had at times long and arduous duties, long hours at the engine room telegraphs in cold fog, etc., and the least inattention was punished. It was, I think, his way of proving us, for he always rewarded us in some way when an extra hard bit of work was over.&quot;

Cooper Key was transferred to a special squadron operating in the Channel formed to combat fears of war with Russia. Fisher went with him as flag captain of HMS &quot;Hercules&quot; from 7 June to 21 August 1878. From 22 August to 12 September he transferred still as flag captain under Cooper Key to . At this time Fisher first became a proponent of the new compass being designed by Sir William Thomson which incorporated corrections for the deviation caused by the metal in iron ships.

From 9 January to 24 July 1879 Fisher commanded serving in the Mediterranean Command under Geoffrey Phipps Hornby. &quot;Pallas&quot; was in poor condition, having a chain passed around the ship to hold the armour plates in place. The tour included an official visit to Istanbul where Fisher dined with the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from gold cups and plates. He then returned to the UK for two months leave at half pay, visiting Bruges with his family.

His next posting, starting 25 September 1879, was to as Flag Captain to Sir Leopold McClintock, commanding the North American squadron. &quot;Northampton&quot; was a new ship with a number of innovations, including twin screws, searchlights and telephones, as well as being armed with torpedoes. It was fitted with an experimental Thomson-designed compass, which the inventor was on hand to adjust. Three days were spent attempting and failing to adjust the compass, with Thomson becoming increasingly bad tempered, until it was noticed that by accident the degree card had been marked with only 359 instead of 360 degrees. The ship was fitted with a new design of lamp created by Captain Philip Colomb, who came on board to inspect them. As a joke, Fisher arranged for anything that could go wrong with the lamps to do so, sending Colomb away disheartened over his invention (although Fisher officially reported favourably about the lamps). On another occasion, the naval hospital at Halifax requested some flags to fly for the Queen&#x27;s birthday. Fisher obliged, but sent only yellow and black flags signifying plague and quarantine. On the other hand, he worked hard at improving his ship. As reported by his second in command, Commander Wilmot Fawkes, the ship carried out 150 runs with torpedoes in a fortnight, whereas the whole rest of the navy performed only 200 in a year.

Fisher&#x27;s brother Philip was serving on the training ship , which disappeared somewhere between the West Indies and England, believed lost in a storm. &quot;Northampton&quot; was one of the ships sent to search for her, but without result. In January 1881 Fisher received news of his appointment to the new ironclad battleship . Admiral McClintock commented, &quot;Everyone regrets the departure of Captain Fisher, but I fancy we shall not fully realize our loss until he is gone...Since his nomination to the &quot;Inflexible&quot;, his spirits have returned and daily increased, and now he almost requires wiring down.&quot; The ship was still building, so Fisher was temporarily appointed to , flagship of the port admiral at Portsmouth between 30 January and 4 July 1881.

===HMS &quot;Inflexible&quot;===
Fisher was considered sufficiently able, with recommendations following all of his postings, to be appointed captain of the newly completed battleship . &quot;Inflexible&quot; had the largest guns and thickest armour of any ship in the navy, but still carried masts and sails and had slow, muzzle-loading guns. She had been seven years under construction and had many innovations built into her, including electric lighting and torpedo tubes, but with such a tortuous layout that crew became lost. The sails were never used for propulsion, but because a ship&#x27;s performance was partly judged on the speed with which a ship could set sails, Fisher was obliged to drill the crew in their use.

In spring 1882 &quot;Inflexible&quot; was part of the Mediterranean Fleet and was assigned to protection of Queen Victoria during a visit to Menton on the Riviera. This was intended as a reminder of British naval prowess to the French, but allowed Fisher to meet Victoria and her grandson, Prince Henry of Prussia, who later became admiral of the German navy. Victoria was impressed by Fisher, as she had been by his brother Philip who had served on royal yachts and for whom she had arranged the ill-fated posting to &quot;Atalanta&quot;.

&quot;Inflexible&quot; took part in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, bombarding the port of Alexandria as part of Admiral Seymour&#x27;s fleet. Fisher was placed in charge of a landing party which was quartered in the Khedive&#x27;s palace. Lacking means of reconnaissance, he devised a plan to armour a train with iron plates, machine gun and cannon. This became celebrated and widely reported by correspondents, so that its inventor, Fisher, came to the attention of the public for the first time as a hero. Shore duty had the unfortunate effect that Fisher became seriously ill with dysentery and malaria. He refused to take sick leave, but eventually was ordered home by Lord Northbrook, who commented, &#x27;the Admiralty could build another &quot;Inflexible&quot;, but not another Fisher&#x27;.

During this time he became a close friend of the future King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. He was appointed a Companion of the Bath (CB) in 1882.

===Home postings===
From January to April 1883, Fisher was on half pay recovering from his illness. In January, he was invited to visit Osborne House for a fortnight by Queen Victoria, concerned about the charming Captain Fisher. Fisher, having entered the navy penniless and unknown, was delighted.

In April 1883, Fisher had recovered sufficiently to return to duty and was appointed commander of . He remained with &quot;Excellent&quot; for two years until June 1885, where he gained a following of officers concerned with the poor offensive capabilities of the fleet, including John Jellicoe and Percy Scott. For the next 15 months he had no naval command and still suffered the effects of his illness. He took to visiting Marienbad, which was famous amongst notable society for its restoring climate, and went there regularly in later years.

During June–July 1885, Fisher served a short posting to in the Baltic under Admiral Hornby, following the Panjdeh Incident, which led to fear of war with Russia.

From November 1886 to 1890, he was Director of Naval Ordnance, responsible for weapons and munitions. He was responsible for the development of quick-firing guns to be used against the growing threat from torpedo boats, and particularly claimed responsibility for removing wooden boarding pikes from navy ships. The Navy did not have responsibility for manufacture and supply of weapons and ammunition, which was in the hands of the War Office. Fisher began a long campaign to return this responsibility to the Admiralty, but did not finally succeed until he later became First Sea Lord. He was appointed Aide-de-Camp to the Queen in 1887, and promoted Rear-Admiral in August 1890.

==Admiral (1890–1902)==
From May 1891 to February 1892, Fisher was Admiral Superintendent of the dockyard at Portsmouth, where he concerned himself with improving the speed of operations. was built in two years rather than three, while changing a barbette gun on a ship was reduced from a two-day operation to two hours. His example obliged all shipyards, both navy and private, to reduce the time they took to complete a ship, making savings in cost and allowing new designs to enter service more rapidly. He used all the tricks he could devise: an official who refused to step outside his office to personally supervise the work was offered a promotion to the tropics; he would find out the name of one or two men amongst a work crew and then make a point of complimenting them on their work and using their names, giving the impression he knew everyone personally; he took a chair and table into the yard where some operation was to be carried out and declared his intention to stay there until the operation was completed. He observed, &quot;When you are told a thing is impossible, that there are insuperable objections, then is the time to fight like the devil&quot;.

His next appointment was Third Naval Lord and Controller of the Navy, the naval officer with overall responsibility for provision of ships and equipment. He presided over the development of torpedo boat destroyers armed with quick-firing small-calibre guns (called destroyers at Fisher&#x27;s suggestion). A suggestion for the boats was brought to the Admiralty in 1892 by Alfred Yarrow of shipbuilders Thornycroft and Yarrow, who reported that he had obtained plans of new torpedo boats being built by the French, and he could build a faster boat to defend against them. Torpedo boats had become a major threat, as they were cheap but potentially able to sink the largest battleships, and France had built large numbers of them. The first destroyers were considered a success and more were ordered, but Fisher immediately ran into trouble by insisting that all shipbuilders, not just Yarrow&#x27;s, should be invited to build boats to Yarrow&#x27;s design. A similar (though opposite) difficulty with vested interests arose over the introduction of water tube boilers into navy ships, which held out the promise of improved fuel efficiency and greater speed. The first examples were used by Thornycroft and Yarrow in 1892, and then were trialled in the gunboat . However, an attempt to specify similar boilers for new cruisers in 1894 led to questions in the House of Commons, and opposition from shipbuilders who did not want to invest in the new technology. The matter continued for several years after Fisher moved on to a new posting, with a parliamentary enquiry rejecting the new boilers. Eventually the new design was adopted, but only after another eighteen ships had been built using the older design, with consequent poorer performance than necessary.
Fisher was knighted in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 1894 as a Knight Commander of the Bath, promoted to vice-admiral in 1896, and put in charge of the North America and West Indies Station in 1897. In 1898 the Fashoda Crisis brought the threat of war with France, to which Fisher responded with plans to raid the French West Indies including Devil&#x27;s Island prison, and return the &quot;infamous&quot; Alfred Dreyfus to France to foment trouble within the French army. It was Fisher&#x27;s policy to conduct all manoeuvres at full speed while training the fleet, and to expect the best from his crews. He would socialise with junior officers so that they were not afraid to approach him with ideas, or disagree with him when the occasion demanded.
Fisher was chosen by Prime Minister Lord Salisbury as British naval delegate to the First Hague Peace Convention in 1899. The peace conference had been called by Russia to agree to limits on armaments, but the British position was to reject any proposal which might restrict use of the navy. Fisher&#x27;s style was to say little in formal meetings, but to lobby determinedly at all informal gatherings. He impressed many by his affability and style, combined with a serious determination to press the British case with everyone he met. The conference ended successfully with limitations only upon dumdum bullets, poison gas and bombings from balloons, and Fisher was rewarded with appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, &quot;&#x27;the tip-top appointment of the fleet&#x27; &quot;. The German delegation summarised Britain&#x27;s position: English world position depended upon the navy, the navy was sufficiently powerful to overcome any combination of states, and England reserved the right to employ that fleet any way it chose.

===Mediterranean Fleet===

Unlike the North America and West Indies station, the Mediterranean Fleet was a vital British command operating from Alexandria and Gibraltar. The important shipping route between India and Britain passed through the Suez Canal, and was considered threatened by France. France was concerned with the route north–south to its colonies in Northern Africa. Fisher retained his flagship from the North American Squadron, , rather than choosing a more powerful but slower traditional battleship, despite criticism from other officers.

His strategy emphasised the importance of striking the first blow, but with an awareness that sunk ships could not easily be replaced, and would replace any officer who could not keep up with the standards he demanded. He gave lectures on naval strategy to which all officers were invited and once again encouraged his officers to bring ideas to him. He offered prizes for essays on tactics and maintained a large tabletop map room with models of all ships in the fleet, where all officers could come to develop tactics. A particular concern was the threat of torpedoes, which Germany had boasted would dispose of the British fleet, and the numerous French torpedo boats. Fisher&#x27;s innovations were not universally approved, with some senior officers resenting the attention he paid to their juniors, or the pressure he placed on all to improve efficiency.

A programme of realistic exercises was adopted including simulated French raids, defensive manoeuvres, night attacks and blockades, all carried out at maximum speed. He introduced a gold cup for the ship which performed best at gunnery, and insisted upon shooting at greater range and from battle formations. He found that he too was learning some of the complications and difficulties of controlling a large fleet in complex situations, and immensely enjoyed it.

Notes from his lectures indicate that, at the start of his time in the Mediterranean, useful working ranges for heavy guns without telescopic sights were considered to be only 2000 yards, or 3000–4000 yards with such sights, whereas by the end of his time discussion centred on how to shoot effectively at 5000 yards. This was driven by the increasing range of the torpedo, which had now risen to 3000–4000 yards, necessitating ships fighting effectively at greater ranges. At this time he advocated relatively small main armaments on capital ships (some had 15 inch or greater), because the improved technical design of the relatively small (10 inch) modern guns allowed a much greater firing rate and greater overall weight of broadside. The potentially much greater ranges of large guns was not an issue, because no one knew how to aim them effectively at such ranges. He argued that &quot;the design of fighting ships must follow the mode of fighting instead of fighting being subsidiary to and dependent on the design of ships.&quot; As regards how officers needed to behave, he commented, &quot; &quot;Think and act for yourself&quot; is the motto for the future, not &quot;Let us wait for orders&quot;.&quot;
Lord Hankey, then a marine officer serving under Fisher, later commented, &quot;It is difficult for anyone who had not lived under the previous regime to realize what a change Fisher brought about in the Mediterranean fleet. ... Before his arrival, the topics and arguments of the officers messes ... were mainly confined to such matters as the cleaning of paint and brasswork. ... These were forgotten and replaced by incessant controversies on tactics, strategy, gunnery, torpedo warfare, blockade, etc. It was a veritable renaissance and affected every officer in the navy.&quot; Lord Charles Beresford, later to become a severe critic of Fisher, gave up a plan to return to Britain and enter parliament, because he had &quot;learnt more in the last week than in the last forty years.&quot;

Fisher implemented a program of banquets and balls for important dignitaries to improve diplomatic relations. The fleet visited Constantinople, where he had three meetings with the sultan and was awarded the Grand Cordon, Order of Osmanieh in November 1900, and the following year he was promoted to full Admiral on 5 November 1901. He lobbied hard with the Admiralty to obtain additional ships and supplies for the Mediterranean squadron. Beresford, who had established a career in politics alongside his naval one, continued a public campaign for greater funding of the fleet, which caused him to come into conflict with the Admiralty. While Fisher agreed with him as to the need for greater funding and instant readiness for war, he chose to stay out of the public debate. However, he maintained a steady confidential correspondence with the journalist Arnold White, providing him with information and advice for a newspaper campaign promoting the needs of the navy. During the course of the correspondence in 1902, Fisher noted that although France was Britain&#x27;s historical enemy, Britain had considerable common interest with France as a possible ally, whereas growing German activity abroad made her a much more likely enemy.

The correspondence revealed that Fisher remained uncertain how his views were being received at the Admiralty and an uncertainty on his part whether he would receive further promotions. He had already received approaches to become a director of Armstrong Whitworth, of Elswick (then Britain&#x27;s largest armaments firm), at a considerably larger salary than that of an admiral and with the possibility of building privately new designs of ship which he believed would be needed to maintain the strength of the fleet.

==Second Sea Lord: reform of officer training (1902–1904)==

In early June 1902 Fisher handed over the command of the Mediterranean Squadron to Admiral Sir Compton Domvile, and returned to the UK to take up the appointment as Second Naval Lord in charge of personnel. He was read in at the Admiralty on 9 June, and took up his duties the following day.

At this time engineering officers, who had become increasingly important in the fleet as it became steadily more dependent upon machinery, were still largely looked down upon by executive (command) officers. Fisher considered it would be better for the navy if the two branches could be merged, as had been done in the past with navigation officers who had similarly once been a completely separate speciality. His solution was to merge the cadet training of ordinary and engineer officers and revise the curriculum so that it provided a suitable grounding to later go on to either path. The proposal was initially resisted by the remainder of the Board of Admiralty, but Fisher convinced them of the benefits of the changes. Objections within the navy as a whole were harder to quell and a campaign once again broke out in newspapers. Fisher was thoroughly aware of the benefits of getting the press on his side and continued to leak information to friendly journalists. Beresford was approached by officers objecting to the changes to act as champion of their cause, but sided with Fisher on this issue.

Training was extended from under two years to four, with the resulting need for more accommodation for cadets. A second cadet establishment, the Royal Naval College, Osborne, was constructed at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight for the first two years of training, with the last two remaining at Dartmouth. All cadets now received an education in science and technology as it related to life on board a ship as well as navigation and seamanship. Those who went on to be command officers would now have the benefit of improved understanding of their ships while those who became engineers would be better equipped for command. Physical education and sport were to be taught, not only for the benefit of the cadets but also for the future training of ships&#x27; crews which were expected to produce sporting teams on good-will visits in foreign ports. Entrance by examination, which biased the intake to those who could obtain special tuition, was replaced with an interview committee tasked with determining the general knowledge of candidates and their reaction to the questions as much as their answers. After the four years, cadets were posted to special training ships for final practical experience before being posted to real command positions. The results of the final examination affected the seniority allotted to each cadet and his chance of future early promotion.

Fisher had described his Selborne-Fisher scheme as &quot;unstoppable by prejudice, Parliament, Satan or even, beyond all these, the Treasury itself&quot;. However his original inclusion of the Royal Marines caused a drastic fall in the number of cadets opting to become officers in that branch of the service. Fisher accordingly was obliged to modify his reforms to exclude the Royal Marines in 1912.

He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list on 26 June 1902, and invested as such by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902.

In 1903 he became Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, with as his flagship.

==First Sea Lord (1904–1910)==

After spending September and the first half of October on the continent Fisher took office as First Sea Lord on 20 October 1904. The appointment came with a house in Queen Anne&#x27;s Gate, but Fisher also leased Langham House, Ham where the family lived until his retirement. In June 1905 he was appointed to the Order of Merit (OM), in December he was promoted Admiral of the Fleet.

Fisher was brought into the Admiralty to reduce naval budgets, and to reform the navy for modern war. Amidst massive public controversy, he ruthlessly sold off 90 obsolete and small ships and put a further 64 into reserve, describing them as &quot;too weak to fight and too slow to run away&quot;, and &quot;a miser&#x27;s hoard of useless junk&quot;. This freed up crews and money to increase the number of large modern ships in home waters. The navy estimate for 1905 was reduced by £3.5 million on the previous year&#x27;s total of £36.8 million despite new building programs and greatly increased effectiveness. Naval expenditure fell from 1905 to 1907, before rising again. By the end of Fisher&#x27;s tenure as First Sea Lord expenditure had returned to 1904 levels.

He was a driving force behind the development of the fast, all-big-gun battleship, and chaired the Committee on Designs which produced the outline design for the first modern battleship, . His committee also produced a new type of cruiser in a similar style to &quot;Dreadnought&quot; with a high speed achieved at the expense of armour protection. This became the battlecruiser, the first being . He also encouraged the introduction of submarines into the Royal Navy, and the conversion from a largely coal-fuelled navy to an oil-fuelled one. He had a long-running public feud with another admiral, Lord Charles Beresford.

In his capacity as First Sea Lord, Fisher proposed multiple times to King Edward VII that Britain should take advantage of its naval superiority to &quot;Copenhagen&quot; the German fleet at Kiel – that is, to destroy it with a pre-emptive surprise attack without declaration of war, as the Royal Navy had done against the Danish Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. In his memoirs, Fisher records a conversation where he was informed that &quot;by all from the German Emperor downwards [he] was the most hated man in Germany&quot;, as the Emperor &quot;had heard of [Fisher&#x27;s] idea for the &quot;Copenhagening&quot; of the German Fleet.&quot; Fisher further added that he doubted that the suggestion had leaked out, and believed that &quot;[the Emperor] only said it because he knew it was what [the British] ought to have done.&quot;

In 1908, he predicted that war between Britain and Germany would occur in October 1914, which later proved accurate, basing his statement on the projected completion of the widening of the Kiel Canal, which would allow Germany to move its large warships safely from the Baltic to the North Sea. He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) that year.

On 7 December 1909, he was created Baron Fisher. He took the punning motto &quot;Fear God and dread nought&quot; on his coat of arms as a reference to &quot;Dreadnought&quot;.

==Before the war (1911–1914)==
He retired to Kilverstone Hall in Norfolk on 25 January 1911, his 70th birthday.

In 1912, Fisher was appointed chairman of the Royal Commission on Fuel and Engines, with a view to converting the entire fleet to oil. Classified &quot;Secret&quot;, Fisher&#x27;s Commission reported in on 27 November 1912, with two follow-up reports on 27 February 1913 and 10 February 1914.

Once the First World War broke out in August 1914, Fisher was a &#x27;constant&#x27; visitor to Churchill at the Admiralty.

==First Sea Lord (1914–1915)==
In October 1914 Lord Fisher was recalled as First Sea Lord, after Prince Louis of Battenberg had been forced to resign because of his German name. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Fisher &quot;was now entering the close of his 74th year but he was never younger or more vigorous&quot;. He resigned on 15 May 1915 amidst bitter arguments with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, over Gallipoli, causing Churchill&#x27;s resignation too. Fisher was never entirely enthusiastic about the campaign—going back and forth in his support, to the consternation and frustration of members of the cabinet—and all in all preferred an amphibious attack on the German Baltic Sea coastline (the Baltic Project), even having the shallow-draft battlecruisers , and constructed for the purpose. As the Gallipoli campaign failed, relations with Churchill became increasingly acrimonious. One of Fisher&#x27;s last contributions to naval construction was the projected , a mammoth battlecruiser which took the principles of the &quot;Courageous&quot; class another step further; mounting 20-inch guns, but still with minimal armour, &quot;Incomparable&quot; was never approved for construction.

Fisher&#x27;s resignation was initially not taken seriously: &quot;Fisher is always resigning&quot; commented the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. However, when Fisher vacated his room at the Admiralty with the announced intention of retiring to Scotland, the Prime Minister sent him an order in the King&#x27;s name to continue his duties. Senior naval officers and the press made appeals to the now elderly (74) First Sea Lord to remain in his position. Fisher responded with an eccentric letter to Asquith setting out six demands that would &quot;guarantee the successful termination of the war&quot;. These would have given him unprecedented sole authority over the fleet, including all promotions and construction. After commenting that Fisher&#x27;s behaviour indicated signs of mental aberration, Asquith responded with a brusque acceptance of Fisher&#x27;s original resignation.

==Last years (1915–1920)==

Fisher was made chairman of the Government&#x27;s Board of Invention and Research, serving in that post until the end of the war. In 1917 he was awarded the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers, Grand Cordon, the highest of eight classes associated with the award. Notice of the King&#x27;s permission to accept and to display this honour was duly published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;.

Admiral Fisher&#x27;s wife, Frances, died in July 1918. She was cremated and her ashes were interred in St Andrew&#x27;s churchyard, adjacent to Kilverstone Hall, on 22 July. Her coffin was draped with Fisher&#x27;s flag as Admiral of the Fleet and topped by a coronet.

Fisher died of cancer at St James Square, London, on 10 July 1920, aged 79, and he was given a national funeral at Westminster Abbey.

His coffin was drawn on a gun-carriage through the streets of London to Westminster Abbey by bluejackets, with six admirals as pall-bearers and an escort of Royal Marines, their arms reversed, to the slow beat of muffled drums. That evening the body was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium. The following day, Fisher&#x27;s ashes were taken by train to Kilverstone, escorted by a Royal Navy guard of honour, and were placed in the grave of his wife, underneath a chestnut tree, overlooking the figurehead of his first seagoing ship, .

==In folklore and popular culture==
* A reference to Fisher was hidden as an encrypted message, the Smithy code, by Mr Justice Peter Smith in the April 2006 judgement on the &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; plagiarism case. Smith&#x27;s biography in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; stated that he was a &quot;Jackie Fisher fan&quot;.
* Fisher is credited by the Oxford English Dictionary with the earliest known use of the phrase &quot;OMG&quot; as an abbreviation for &quot;Oh my God&quot;, in a letter to Winston Churchill on 9 September 1917. In Fisher&#x27;s case it was &quot;Oh! My God!&quot;
* Fisher coined the phrase &quot;Buggins&#x27; turn&quot; to describe the practice of making appointments by rotation or seniority rather than by merit, which he saw as a problem within the navy.
* The song &quot;Old Admirals&quot; on the Al Stewart album &quot;Past, Present, and Future&quot; is based largely on Fisher&#x27;s life.
* Fisher makes an appearance as a midshipman during the Taiping Rebellion in George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s novel &quot;Flashman and the Dragon&quot; (1985).

<text>In zoology, a crepuscular animal is one that is active primarily during the twilight period, being matutinal, vespertine/vespertinal, or both. This is distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior, where an animal is active during the hours of daytime and of night, respectively. Some crepuscular animals may also be active by moonlight or during an overcast day. Matutinal animals are active only after dawn, and vespertine only before dusk.

A number of factors affect the time of day an animal is active. Predators hunt when their prey is available, and prey try to avoid the times when their principal predators are at large. The temperature may be too high at midday or too low at night. Some creatures may adjust their activities depending on local competition.

==Etymology and usage==
The word &quot;crepuscular&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;&quot; (&quot;twilight&quot;). Its sense accordingly differs from diurnal and nocturnal behavior, which respectively peak during hours of daytime and night. The distinction is not absolute, because crepuscular animals may also be active on a bright moonlit night or on a dull day. Some animals casually described as nocturnal are in fact crepuscular.

Special classes of crepuscular behaviour include matutinal, or &quot;matinal&quot;, animals active only in the dawn, and vespertine, only in the dusk. Those active during both times are said to have a bimodal activity pattern.

==Adaptive relevance==

The various patterns of activity are thought to be mainly antipredator adaptations, though some could equally well be predatory adaptations. Many predators forage most intensively at night, whereas others are active at midday and see best in full sun. The crepuscular habit may both reduce predation pressure, increasing the crepuscular populations, and offer better foraging opportunities to predators that increasingly focus their attention on crepuscular prey until a new balance is struck. Such shifting states of balance are often found in ecology.

Some predatory species adjust their habits in response to competition from other predators. For example, the subspecies of short-eared owl that lives on the Galápagos Islands is normally active during the day, but on islands like Santa Cruz that are home to the Galapagos hawk, the owl is crepuscular.

Apart from the relevance to predation, crepuscular activity in hot regions also may be the most effective way of avoiding heat stress while capitalizing on available light.

Crepuscular flight activity is preferred by some animals, such as the walnut twig beetle, due to warmer temperatures, moderate wind speeds, and low barometric pressure.

Crepuscular activity can be influenced by the lunar cycle due to the change in nocturnal light. This creates changes in animal sleep, reproduction, and foraging behaviours, often becoming less active during periods of low light.

== Migration ==
Animal patterns of activity sometimes change during migration due to changes in environmental conditions. Mule deer are crepuscular, but they are only active at dusk before and during migration. In the spring they are only active at dawn because the snow is at its hardest, so it is easier for the deer to move without sinking in the snow.

During migration, some types of swallow are active primarily during daytime hours with some activity during twilight hours.

== Human impact on crepuscular behaviour ==
Crepuscular animal activity is affected by human activity, because humans are diurnal. Crepuscular animals are less likely to participate in typical foraging or reproductive behaviors and deal with increased stress and mortality rates when humans are present. Animals may change their usual activity patterns in response to the presence of humans. For example, Asian black bears may avoid areas with high human activity during the day, but go to these locations during twilight or nighttime hours.

Light pollution impacts crepuscular behaviour because it mimics natural light conditions, leading crepuscular animals to behave as they would on nights with more moonlight.

==Occurrence of crepuscular behaviour==

Many familiar mammal species are crepuscular, including the endangered Amazon river dolphin, some species of bats, hamsters, housecats, stray dogs, rabbits, ferrets, rats, jaguars, ocelots, bobcats, servals, strepsirrhines, red pandas, bears, deer, moose, sitatunga, capybaras, chinchillas, the common mouse, skunks, squirrels, foxes, wombats, wallabies, possums and marsupial gliders, tenrecs, and spotted hyenas.

Snakes, lizards, and frogs, especially those in desert environments, may be crepuscular.

Crepuscular birds include the common nighthawk, barn owl, owlet-nightjar, chimney swift, American woodcock, spotted crake, white-breasted waterhen, European nightjars, and common buzzards.

Many moths, beetles, flies, and other insects are crepuscular and vespertine. For example, Coprophanaeus ensifer, a South American necrophagous beetle, is most active during at dusk and dawn.

<doc id="376507" wikidata="Q5001209" url="?curid=376507" title="Bus contention">
<text>Bus contention is an undesirable state in computer design where more than one device on a bus attempts to place values on it at the same time. 

Bus contention is the kind of telecommunication contention that occurs when all communicating devices communicate directly with each other through a single shared channel, and contrasted with &quot;network contention&quot; that occurs when communicating devices communicate indirectly with each other, through point-to-point connections through routers or bridges.

Bus contention can lead to erroneous operation, excess power consumption, and, in unusual cases, permanent damage to the hardware—such as burning out a MOSFET.

==Description==
Most bus architectures requires devices sharing a bus to follow an arbitration protocol carefully designed to make the likelihood of contention negligible. However, when devices on the bus have logic errors, manufacturing defects, or are driven beyond their design speeds, arbitration may break down and contention may result. Contention may also arise on systems which have a programmable memory mapping when illegal values are written to the registers controlling the mapping.
Most small-scale computer systems are carefully designed to avoid bus contention on the system bus. They use a single device, called bus arbiter, that controls which device is allowed to drive the bus at each instant, so bus contention never happens in normal operation. The standard solution to bus contention between memory devices, such as EEPROM and SRAM, is the three-state bus with a bus arbiter.

Some networks, such as Token Ring, are also designed to avoid bus contention, so bus contention never happens in normal operation.

Most networks are designed with hardware robust enough to tolerate occasional bus contention on the network. CAN bus, ALOHAnet, Ethernet, etc., all experience occasional bus contention in normal operation, but use some protocol (such as Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance, carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection, or automatic repeat request) to minimize the times that contention occurs, and to re-send data that was corrupted in a packet collision.

<text>Midgard is an open source persistent storage framework. It provides an object-oriented and replicated environment for building data-intensive applications.

Midgard also ships with MidCOM content management system (CMS) built on the Midgard framework. MidCOM&#x27;s features include web-based authoring WYSIWYG interfaces and a component interface for installing additional web functionalities, including wikis and blogs.

Midgard is built on the GNOME stack of libraries like GLib and libgda, and has language bindings for C, Python, Objective-C and PHP. Communications between applications written in the different languages happen over D-Bus. The CMS functionalities run on the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) platform. Midgard can also be used with PHPCR, the PHP implementation of the Java Content Repository standard. In early 2000s (decade) there was also a pure-PHP implementation of the Midgard API called Midgard Lite that has since been re-implemented as the &quot;midgard-portable&quot; project.

The project follows the synchronized, 6 month release cycle that is implemented by several major open source projects like Ubuntu and GNOME. Because of this, the version numbering reflects the year and month of a release. The version 8.09 Ragnaroek has been designated as a &quot;Long Term Support&quot; release.

Especially the templating and page composition features of Midgard have received praise, earning honorary mentions in several CMS Watch surveys. It also got score of 42 out of 45 in the &quot;Celebrity CMS Deathmatch&quot; of 2009

==Etymology==

The name Midgard comes from Nordic mythology, meaning &quot;Middle earth&quot;, the world of humans. Most of the Midgard developer community comes from the Baltic region, and the project has been referred by CMS Watch as the Hanseatic League of Content Management.

==History==

Midgard Project was started in early 1998 by Jukka Zitting and Henri Bergius for a Finnish historical reenactment organization —Harmaasudet— as a system for them to publish their material online.

Since the organization didn&#x27;t have resources to maintain a large development project by itself, the open source model was chosen for creating a community of contributors to the system. The version 1.0 of Midgard was released to the public on May 8, 1999. It attracted a steady stream of users, and the development project flourished despite quite primitive early user interfaces.

Commercial services for the platform started to appear in early 2000. One of the first adopters was Envida, a Dutch company that realized the potential of Midgard for Web hosting purposes. First proprietary application for the platform was Hong Kong Linux Center (HKLC) Nadmin Studio content management system.

In early 2000s (decade), Midgard developers participated actively in OSCOM, the collaborative organization for open source content management systems. This included development of shared content editing clients like Twingle and tutorials in various conferences. Midgard also featured in F.U.D., the Wyona Pictures documentary about OSCOM.

First application not connected with content management was &quot;Nemein.Net&quot;,
a Professional Services Automation application released in 2002 by Nemein, a Finnish Midgard company. In May 2004 the Nemein.Net suite was renamed to OpenPSA and released under Open Source licensing.

By 2009, some social web services, like Qaiku have also adopted Midgard as their content management platform. It also runs in organizations like Helsinki University of Technology and Maemo. e-commerce implementations with Midgard include the Movie-TV online video rental service. It has been used by New Zealand government for running the country&#x27;s eGovernment portal.

Midgard has seen some non-Web use also, including providing synchronization with the Tomboy note-taking application for Linux desktop.

In addition to regular content management, Midgard is seeing use in special web application scenarios like Lufthansa&#x27;s system for managing global marketing budgets and HP&#x27;s client documentation system.

The Midgard content repository library entered the Debian distribution in November 2010. Some parts of the history of Midgard are recounted in the book Open Advice.

==Licensing==

The Midgard core libraries and the MidCOM CMS are distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), a license which permits the software to be freely used so long as it is dynamically linked or the user can relink it to new versions of the libraries. This is the same license used by the GNU C Library. This licensing scheme qualifies Midgard as free software developed with an open source model.

<text>The ICAO airport code or location indicator is a four-letter code designating aerodromes around the world. These codes, as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization and published quarterly in ICAO Document 7910: &quot;Location Indicators&quot;, are used by air traffic control and airline operations such as flight planning.
ICAO codes are also used to identify other aviation facilities such as weather stations, international flight service stations or area control centers, regardless of whether they are located at airports. Flight information regions are also identified by a unique ICAO-code.

==History==

The recommendations for ICAO airport codes were adopted on 24 March 1959, and came into force on 1 October the same year.

== ICAO codes versus IATA codes ==
ICAO codes are separate and different from IATA codes, the latter of which have three letters and are generally used for airline timetables, reservations, and baggage tags. For example, the IATA code for London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport is LHR and its ICAO code is EGLL. IATA codes are used by flight-tracking services such as FlightAware.

In general IATA codes are usually derived from the name of the airport or the city it serves, while ICAO codes are distributed by region and country. Far more aerodromes (in the broad sense) have ICAO codes than IATA codes, which are sometimes assigned to railway stations as well. The selection of ICAO codes is partly delegated to authorities in each country, while IATA codes, which have no geographic structure, must be decided centrally by IATA.

== Structure ==
The first one or two letters of the ICAO code indicate the country; the remaining letters identify the airport. For example, the ICAO code for Heathrow International Airport in London, is EGLL, with EG reflecting that it is based in the United Kingdom. By contrast, IATA codes do not provide geographic reference. For example, LHR, representing Heathrow, does not enable one to deduce the location of the airport LHV with any greater certainty; it is William T. Piper Memorial Airport in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania in the United States.

There are a few exceptions to the regional structure of the ICAO code for political or administrative reasons:
* RAF Mount Pleasant air base in the Falkland Islands, for instance, is assigned the ICAO code EGYP as though it were in the United Kingdom, but nearby civilian Port Stanley Airport is assigned SFAL, consistent with South America.
* Saint Pierre and Miquelon is controlled by France, and airports there are assigned LFxx as though they were in Europe.
* Kosovo is assigned the code BKxx grouping it with Greenland and Iceland rather than its geographical neighbors which have Lxxx (described below).
* Jerusalem International Airport was assigned both LLJR (its Israeli persona) as well as OJJR (its Jordanian persona), but the airport itself fell into disuse.

Western Sydney Airport, due to open in 2026 has the ICAO code YSWS. In Australia, the second letter is usually linked to the airport&#x27;s FIR. However, Sydney&#x27;s FIR has been non-existent since the introduction of TAAATS.

In the contiguous United States and Canada, many airports have ICAO codes that are simply copies of their three-letter IATA codes, with the geographical prefix added on (e.g., YEG and CYEG both refer to Edmonton International Airport, while IAD and KIAD both refer to Washington Dulles International Airport). This similarity does not extend to Alaska (PAxx), Hawaii (PHxx), or U.S. territories. Kahului Airport on Maui, for instance, has an IATA code of OGG and an ICAO code of PHOG.

ICAO airport codes do not begin with I or J or X or Q, though the Jezero Crater on Mars is assigned the special ICAO code JZRO. Codes beginning with I (Ixx and Ixxx) are often used for navigational aids such as radio beacons, while the Q code is reserved for international radiocommunications and non-geographical special use. 

In Russia, Latin letter X, or its Morse/Baudot Cyrillic equivalent Ь, are used to designate government, military, and experimental aviation airfields in internal airfield codes similar in structure and purpose to ICAO codes but not used internationally. ZZZZ is a pseudo-code, used in flight plans for aerodromes with no ICAO code assigned.

ICAO codes are sometimes updated. Johannesburg Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa, for instance, was formerly known as Jan Smuts International Airport, with code FAJS. When the airport was renamed O. R. Tambo International Airport, its ICAO code was updated to FAOR.

Some airports have two ICAO codes, usually when an airport is shared by civilian and military users. Frankfurt Airport in Frankfurt, Germany, for instance, has been assigned ICAO code EDDF while Rhein-Main Air Base was assigned ICAO code EDAF until its closure. Sion Airport in Switzerland has code LSGS while its military facilities have the ICAO code LSMS. Brussels Airport in Brussels, Belgium, has the ICAO code EBBR for its civilian facilities, and Melsbroek Air Base has been assigned ICAO code EBMB, even though the two airports share runways and ground and air control facilities.

== Pseudo ICAO-codes ==
In small countries like Belgium or the Netherlands, almost all aerodromes have an ICAO code. For larger countries like the UK or Germany this is not feasible, given the limited number of letter codes. Some countries have addressed this issue by introducing a scheme of sub-ICAO aerodrome codes; France, for example, assigns pseudo ICAO codes in the style &quot;LFddnn&quot;, where &quot;dd&quot; indicates the department while &quot;nn&quot; is a sequential counter. The French Federation of Ultralight Motorized Gliders was formally named the keeper of these codes. Aerodrome de Torreilles in France, for instance, has code LF6651. In Antarctica many aerodromes have pseudo ICAO-codes with AT and two digits, while others have proper codes from countries performing air control such as NZ for New Zealand.
