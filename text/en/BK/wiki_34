<text>The Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ArSSR), also known as Soviet Armenia, or simply Armenia, was one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union, located in the Caucasus region of Eurasia. Soviet Armenia bordered the Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Georgia and the independent states of Iran and Turkey. The capital of the republic was Yerevan and it contained thirty-seven districts (raions). Other major cities in the ArmSSR included Leninakan, Kirovakan, Hrazdan, Etchmiadzin, and Kapan. The republic was governed by Communist Party of Armenia, a republican branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Soviet Armenia was established on 29 November 1920, with the Sovietisation of the short-lived First Republic of Armenia. Consequently, it has been referred to as the Second Republic of Armenia. It became part of the Transcaucasian SFSR (TSFSR), along with neighboring Georgia and Azerbaijan, which comprised one of the four founding republics of the USSR. When the TSFSR was dissolved in 1936, Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union.

As part of the Soviet Union, Armenia initially experienced stabilization under the administration of Alexander Miasnikian during Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s New Economic Policy (NEP). During its seventy-one year history, the republic was transformed from a largely agricultural hinterland to an important industrial production center, while its population almost quadrupled from around 880,000 in 1926 to 3.3 million in 1989 due to natural growth and large-scale influx of Armenian genocide survivors and their descendants.

Soviet Armenia suffered during the Great Purge of Joseph Stalin, but contributed significantly to the Soviet victory in the Great Patriotic War of World War II. After the death of Stalin, Armenia experienced a new period of liberalization during the Khrushchev Thaw. Following the Brezhnev era, Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms of &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot; saw the rise of nationalist movements challenging the republic&#x27;s territorial configuration within the Soviet Union. Local authorities declared state sovereignty on 23 August 1990 and boycotted the March 1991 referendum on the New Union Treaty. An independence referendum held on 21 September 1991 was supported by more than 99% of voters. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991, the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic ceased to exist and Armenia became an independent state.

== Formal name ==

Following the Sovietization of Armenia, the republic became officially known as the &quot;Socialist Soviet Republic of Armenia&quot;. After the dissolution of the TSFSR in 1936, the name was changed to the &quot;Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic&quot;, which was used until 1991.

In Armenian, the official name had been variously changed since the creation of the ArSSR. It was initially &quot;Hayastani Socʼialistakan Xorhrdayin Hanrapetutʼyun&quot; (, &quot;Socialist Soviet Republic of Armenia&quot;). The second name, in accordance to the then latest Soviet Constitution, was adopted on 5 December 1936 as &quot;Haykakan Xorhrdayin Socʻialistakan Hanrapetutʻyun&quot; (, &quot;Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic&quot;), with the term &quot;haykakan&quot; (, &quot;Armenian&quot;) replacing &quot;Hayastani&quot; (, &quot;Armenia&quot;), and transposing the second (սոցիալիստական, &quot;socialist&quot;) and third (Խորհրդային, &quot;soviet&quot;) words. It was ratified by the ninth All-Armenian Extraordinary Congress of Soviets on 23 March 1937.

Thereafter, direct borrowings of &quot;soviet&quot; (սովետական, &quot;sovetakan&quot;) and &quot;republic&quot; (ռեսպուբլիկա, &quot;ṙespublika&quot;) were included in the formal name on 22 August 1940, in accordance with a regulation approved by the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Enlightenment of the Armenian SSR. In 1966, the original term for republic was restored.

On 25 June 1989, the Supreme Council of the Armenian SSR passed the bill that constitutionally restored the 1936 name, as well as in other legislative acts.
After declaring the sovereign polity, the Supreme Council adopted the Declaration of Independence in which the formal name was declared &quot;Hayastani Hanrapetut’yun&quot; (, &quot;Republic of Armenia&quot;) on 23 August 1990.

== History ==
=== Sovietization ===

Prior to Soviet rule, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF, Dashnaksutiun) had governed the First Republic of Armenia. The Socialist Soviet Republic of Armenia was founded in 1920. Armenian diasporas were divided about this; supporters of the nationalist Dashnaksutiun did not support the Soviet state, while supporters of the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) were more positive about the newly founded Soviet state.

Eastern Armenia had been part of the Russian Empire, since the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay up until the October Revolution, and partly confined to the borders of the Erivan Governorate. After the October Revolution, the Bolshevik government led by Vladimir Lenin announced that minority cultures of the empire could pursue a course of self-determination, and in May 1918 Armenia, and its neighbors Azerbaijan and Georgia, declared their independence from Russian rule and each established separate republics. However, the Red Army overthrew the Azerbaijan Republic and established Azerbaijan SSR by May 1920, and the Armenian government, worried about their sovereignty, responded by sending a mission to Moscow in May to convince the Bolsheviks that &quot;an independent and friendly Armenia would be better for Russian interests in the region&quot;. In the meantime, the Bolshevik movement already arrived in Armenia, although a minority, they were vocal and managed to design a small May uprising in Alexandropol, the largest city of the Eastern Armenia, demanding the establishment of a Soviet Republic. The revolt was suppressed by the Armenian government by May 14 and its leaders executed or exiled.

The sources mentioned in &quot;A Concise History of the Armenian People&quot; give different interpretations of the precursor events that led to the Red Army&#x27;s invasion of Armenia and the establishment of Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ArSSR). The sources, sympathetic to the Armenian nationalist and anti-Sovietism movement (Dashnaks), claim that the Bolsheviks gave the Armenians false assurances, while awaiting the results of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations. The anti-Dashnak sources point out that the Dashnak government was to blame, because the majority of them refused to work with the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, bringing tension to the relations and forcing the Russian Bolshevik into making a treaty with the Turkish government, signed in Moscow on August 20, 1920. A number of Bolsheviks insisted that the Turks had to give Armenians some territory from western Armenia, but the Turks refused to discuss the issue of borders. Both Joseph Stalin, who did not favor the Armenians, and Vladimir Lenin, who was more concerned about other diplomatic matters, agreed to the proposals of the agreement. Additionally, the Russian Bolsheviks assured cooperation and noninterference during the Turkish invasion of Armenia in late September, the agreement which they effectively was broken shortly afterwards.

By mid-November, the Turks recaptured most of the territories they controlled before the end of WWI, and the Russian government, worried by the rapid advancement of the Turkish armies, approached the Yerevan government and offered to intercede on their behalf. At the end of November the Bolsheviks encroached onto Armenian territory and sent an ultimatum, proposing that &quot;Armenia&#x27;s salvation lay in becoming a Bolshevik state, and cutting its ties to the West&quot;. Clench between two powerful forces, the Armenian government sent the former Prime Minister Alexander Khatisian to negotiate with the Turks and appointed a team headed by General Drastamat Kanayan to transfer the government to the Bolsheviks. On December 2, General Kanayan signed a short-living pact with the Bolsheviks guaranteeing Armenian sovereignty as &quot;independent Soviet state&quot;, and moreover, the Bolsheviks promised to restore its pre-September 1920 borders. Dashnaks, as well as other party representatives were guaranteed freedom and continued to serve the state in a number of positions. &quot;A few days&quot; later, Bolsheviks of the Revolutionary Committee, led by Sarkis Kasyan and Avis Nurijanyan and supported by the Red Army, arrived in Yerevan and, violating the agreement made with General Kanayan, arrested a number of Dashnak officials and officers, &quot;wreak[ing] havoc for the next two months&quot;. In the aftermath, the nationalist of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation started a short-lived, anti-Bolshevik rebellion in February–April 1921.

After the Yerevan was recaptured from the anti-Bolshevik rebellion, the Turks and Russians, without any representatives from Armenia or Georgia, negotiated the fate of Armenia and the rest of Transcaucasia. In the treaties of Moscow and Kars, Turkey renounced its claims on Batumi to Georgia and guaranteed the independence of Armenian Republic—in exchange they gained rights to the regions of Kars, Ardahan, and Surmalu, including the medieval Armenian capital Ani and the cultural icon of the Armenian people (Mount Ararat). Additionally, despite opposition from Armenian Bolshevik revolutionary Alexander Miasnikian, the Soviet government granted Nagorno-Karabakh and Nakhichevan to Soviet Azerbaijan, as they did not have direct control over those areas at the time and were primarily concerned with restoring regional stability. Finally, the sides agreed that the treaty would be later signed and ratified by the Transcaucasian Republics.

=== New Economic Policy (NEP) ===

From 12 March 1922 to 5 December 1936, Armenia was a part of the Transcaucasian SFSR (TSFSR) together with the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. The policies of the first Soviet Armenian government (the Revolutionary Committee, headed by young, inexperienced, and militant communists such as Sarkis Kasyan and Avis Nurijanyan) were implemented in a high-handed manner and did not take into consideration the poor conditions of the republic and the general weariness of the people after years of conflict and civil strife. As the Soviet Armenian historian Bagrat Borian, who was to later perish during Stalin&#x27;s purges, wrote in 1929:

Such was the degree and scale of the requisitioning and terror imposed by the local Cheka that in February 1921 the Armenians, led by former leaders of the republic, rose up in revolt and briefly unseated the communists in Yerevan. The Red Army, which was campaigning in Georgia at the time, returned to suppress the revolt and drove its leaders out of Armenia.

Convinced that these heavy-handed tactics were the source of the alienation of the native population to Soviet rule, in 1921, Lenin appointed Myasnikyan, an experienced administrator, to carry out a more moderate policy and one better attuned to Armenian national sensibilities. With the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP), Armenians began to enjoy a period of relative stability. Life under Soviet rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent years of the First Republic. Alexander Tamanian began to realize his city plan for Yerevan and the population received medicine, food, as well as other provisions from Moscow.

Prior to his debilitating illness, Lenin encouraged the policy of &quot;korenizatsiya&quot; or &quot;nativization&quot; in the republics which essentially called for the different nationalities of the Soviet Union to &quot;administer their republics&quot;, establishing native-language schools, newspapers, and theaters. In Armenia, the Soviet government directed all illiterate citizens up to the age of fifty to attend school and learn to read Armenian, which became the official language of the republic. Throughout the Soviet era, the number of Armenian-language newspapers (&quot;Sovetakan Hayastan&quot;), magazines (&quot;Garun&quot;), and journals (&quot;Sovetakan Grakanutyun&quot;, &quot;Patma-Banasirakan Handes&quot;) grew. A Kurdish newspaper, &quot;Riya Teze&quot; (&quot;The New Path&quot;), was established in Armenia in 1930.

An institute for culture and history was created in 1921 in Ejmiatsin and the Yerevan Opera Theatre and a dramatic theater in Yerevan were built and established in the 1920s and 1930s. Popular works in the fields of art and literature were produced by Martiros Saryan, Yeghishe Charents, Axel Bakunts, and Shushanik Kurghinian who all adhered to the socialist dictum of creating works &quot;national in form, socialist in content.&quot; Armenkino released the first Armenian feature film, &quot;Namus&quot; (Honor) in 1925 and the first Kurdish film, &quot;Zare&quot;, in 1926. Both were directed by Hamo Bek-Nazaryan, who would later direct the first Armenian sound film &quot;Pepo&quot;, released in 1935.

=== Stalinism and the Great Purge ===
The situation in Armenia and the USSR significantly changed after the death of Lenin and the rise of Joseph Stalin to Soviet leader. In the Caucasus, Stalin&#x27;s ally in Georgia, Lavrentiy Beria, sought to consolidate his control over the region, resulting in a political struggle with Armenian First Secretary Aghasi Khanjian. The struggle culminated in Khanjian&#x27;s assassination by Beria in Tiflis (Tbilisi) on 9 July 1936, beginning the Great Purge in Armenia. At first, Beria framed Khanjian&#x27;s death as &quot;suicide&quot;, but soon condemned him for abetting &quot;rabid nationalist elements&quot;.

After Khanjian&#x27;s death, Beria promoted his loyalists in Armenia, Amatuni Amatuni as Armenian First Secretary and Khachik Mughdusi as chief of the Armenian NKVD. Under the command of Beria&#x27;s allies, the campaign against &quot;enemies&quot; intensified. Expressions of &quot;nationalism&quot; were suspect and many leading Armenian intellectuals were executed or imprisoned, including Charents, Bakunts, Gurgen Mahari, Vahan Totovents, Nersik Stepanyan, and others. According to Amatuni in a June 1937 letter to Stalin, 1,365 people were arrested in the ten months after the death of Khanjian, among them 900 &quot;Dashnak-Trotskyists&quot;.

The arrest and death of Sahak Ter-Gabrielyan in August 1937 was a turning point in the repressions. When being interrogated by Mughdusi, Ter-Gabrielyan &quot;either jumped or was thrown from&quot; the window of the NKVD building in Yerevan. Stalin was angered that Mughdusi and Amatuni neglected to inform him about the incident. In response, in September 1937, he sent Georgy Malenkov, Mikhail Litvin, and later Anastas Mikoyan to oversee a purge of the Communist Party of Armenia. During his trip to Armenia, Mikoyan tried, but failed, to save one individual (Daniel &quot;Danush&quot; Shahverdyan) from being executed. More than a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office. The trip also resulted in the appointment of a new Armenian Party leadership, headed by Grigory Arutinov, who was approved by Beria.

The Armenian Apostolic Church was not spared from the repressions. Soviet attacks against the Church under Stalin were known since 1929, but momentarily eased to improve the Soviet Union&#x27;s relations with the Armenian diaspora. In 1932, Khoren I became Catholicos of All Armenians and assumed the leadership of the church. However, in the late 1930s, the Armenian NKVD, led by Mughdusi and his successor, Viktor Khvorostyan, renewed the attacks against the Church. These attacks culminated in the 1938 murder of Khoren and the closing of the Catholicate of Ejmiatsin, an act for which Beria is usually held responsible. However, the Church survived and was later revived when Stalin eased restrictions on religion at the end of World War II.

In addition to the repression of the Church, tens of thousands of Armenians were executed or deported, as with various other ethnic minorities living in the Soviet Union under Stalin. In 1936, Beria and Stalin worked to deport Armenians to Siberia in an attempt to bring Armenia&#x27;s population under 700,000 in order to justify an annexation into Georgia.

=== Great Patriotic War ===

Armenia was spared the devastation and destruction that wrought most of the western Soviet Union during the Great Patriotic War of World War II. The Wehrmacht never reached the South Caucasus, which they intended to do in order to capture the oil fields in Azerbaijan. Still, Armenia played a valuable role in the war in providing food, manpower and war material. An estimated 300–500,000 Armenians served in the war, almost half of whom did not return. Many attained the highest honor of Hero of the Soviet Union. Over sixty Armenians were promoted to the rank of general, and with an additional four eventually achieving the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union: Ivan Bagramyan (the first non-Slavic commander to hold the position of front commander when he was assigned to be the commander of the First Baltic Front in 1943), Admiral Ivan Isakov, Hamazasp Babadzhanian, and Sergei Khudyakov. Another prominent wartime figure was Artem Mikoyan, the younger brother of Anastas, who, along with Mikhail Gurevich, was the designer and co-founder of the Soviet MiG fighter jet company.

In an effort to shore up popular support for the war effort, the Soviet government allowed certain expressions of nationalism with the publication of Armenian novels such as Derenik Demirchian&#x27;s &quot;Vardanank&quot;, the production of films like &quot;David Bek&quot; (1944), and the easing of restrictions placed against the Church. Stalin temporarily relaxed his attacks on religion during the war. This led to the election of bishop Gevorg in 1945 as new Catholicos Gevorg VI. He was subsequently allowed to reside in Ejmiatsin.

At the end of the war, after Germany&#x27;s capitulation, the Soviet government attempted to annul the Treaty of Kars, allowing it to regain the provinces of Kars, Ardahan, Artvin, and Surmalu. On 7 June 1945, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov informed the Turkish ambassador in Moscow that the disputed provinces should be returned to Soviet Union in the name of both the Armenian and Georgian Soviet Republics. Turkey itself was in no condition to fight a war with the Soviet Union, which had emerged as a superpower after the Second World War. The Soviet territorial claims were supported by the Armenian Catholicos and by all shades of the Armenian diaspora, including the anti-Soviet Dashnaksutiun. However, with the onset of the Cold War, especially the Truman Doctrine in 1947, Turkey strengthened its ties with the West. The Soviet Union relinquished its claims over the lost territories, and Ankara joined the anti-Soviet NATO military alliance in 1952.

=== Armenian repatriation ===

With the republic suffering heavy losses after the war, Stalin allowed an open immigration policy in Armenia; the diaspora were encouraged to repatriate to Armenia (&quot;nergaght&quot;) and revitalize the population and bolster the workforce. Armenians living in countries such as Cyprus, France, Greece, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria were primarily the survivors or the descendants of the genocide. Offered an expenses paid return, an estimated 150,000 Armenians arrived in Soviet Armenia between 1946 and 1948, settling in Yerevan, Leninakan, Kirovakan and other towns.

Lured by numerous incentives such as food coupons, better housing and other benefits, they were received coldly by the Armenians living in the Republic upon their arrival. The repatriates spoke the Western Armenian dialect, instead of the Eastern Armenian prevalent in Soviet Armenia. They were often addressed as &quot;aghbars&quot; (&quot;brothers&quot;) by Armenians living in the republic, due to their different pronunciation of the word. Initially humorous in tone, usage evolved to carry a more pejorative connotation.

Thousands of Armenians were forcibly exiled to the Altai Krai in 1949. Many were repatriated Armenians who had arrived from the Armenian diaspora, but who were suspected of being Dashnak party members. Lazare Indjeyan″s &quot;Les Années volées&quot; and Armand Maloumian″s &quot;Les Fils du Goulag&quot; are two repatriate narratives about incarceration and eventual escape from the gulags. Many other repatriate narratives explored family memories of the genocide and resettlement in the Soviet Union.

=== Khrushchev Thaw in Armenia ===

Armenia underwent significant social and cultural changed in the aftermath of Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 and the emergence of Nikita Khrushchev as the new Soviet leader. One of Khrushchev&#x27;s advisers and close friends, Armenian Politburo member Anastas Mikoyan, urged Armenians to reaffirm their national identity. In March 1954, two years before Khrushchev denounced Stalin, Mikoyan gave a speech in Yerevan where he encouraged the republication of Raffi and Raphael Patkanian, the rehabilitation of Charents, and the revival of the memory of Miasnikian. Behind the scenes, he assisted Soviet Armenian leaders in the rehabilitation of former &quot;enemies&quot; in the republic.

Khrushchev, in his speech &quot;On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences&quot; delivered before the 20th Party Congress in 1956, Khrushchev sharply denounced Stalin and his crimes. During the subsequent Khrushchev Thaw Soviet leadership loosened the grip of the pervasive NKVD and rehabilitated dead communists executed during the Great Purge, such as Khanjian and Charents, as well as the releasing thousands political prisoners from the Siberian gulag. The works of Raffi and Raphael Patkanian were returned to print. In 1962, the massive statue of Stalin that towered over Yerevan was pulled down from its pedestal by troops and replaced in 1967 with that of Mother Armenia. Moreover, the Union-wide economic reforms affected Armenia, diversifying its grain production, farmers were permitted to cultivate small plots for their own personal use, and the newly-integrated production of livestock and various irrigation projects increased Armenia&#x27;s agricultural output.

Religious freedom, to a limited degree, was granted to Armenia when Catholicos Vazgen I assumed office in 1955. The party once again accepted Armenian language and culture, and a new policy of &quot;nativization&quot; emerged. Armenians from other parts of the USSR came, as well as Armenians from Iran, came to Yerevan. Contacts between Armenia and the diaspora were revived, and Armenians from abroad were able to visit the republic more frequently. In 1959, the Matenadaran was opened in Yerevan as an archive to house the nationalized monastic collections of Echmiadzin, and to encourage preservation of the manuscripts, to promote historical studies and publish materials.

Mikoyan was not the only Armenian figure who rose to prominence during this era. Other noted Soviet Armenians included composers Aram Khachaturian, Arno Babajanian, Konstantin Orbelyan, and Tigran Mansurian; scientists Viktor Hambardzumyan and Artem Alikhanyan; actors Armen Dzhigarkhanyan and Frunzik Mkrtchyan; filmmakers Frunze Dovlatyan, Henrik Malyan, Sergei Parajanov, and Artavazd Peleshyan; artists Minas Avetisyan, Yervand Kochar, Hakob Kojoyan, and Tereza Mirzoyan; singers Georgi Minasyan, Raisa Mkrtchyan, and Ruben Matevosyan; and writers Avetik Isahakyan, Silva Kaputikyan, Hrant Matevosyan, Paruyr Sevak, and Hovhannes Shiraz, among many others.

=== Brezhnev era ===
After Leonid Brezhnev assumed power in 1964, many of Khrushchev&#x27;s reforms were partly curtailed, wary of a potential Armenian nationalism resurgence, however it did not impose the sort of restrictions seen during Stalin&#x27;s time. On 24 April 1965, thousands of Armenians demonstrated in the streets of Yerevan during the fiftieth anniversary of the Armenian genocide. In the aftermath of these demonstrations, the memorial in honor of the genocide victims was erected at the Tsitsernakaberd hill above the Hrazdan gorge in Yerevan in 1967. The government also permitted the construction of other monuments honoring the important events of the Armenian history, such as monuments commemorating the Sardarapat and Bash Abaran, as well as creation of statues dedicated to popular Armenian figures like the fifth-century military commander Vardan Mamikonian and the folk hero David of Sassoun.

The Brezhnev era saw the rise of corruption and shadow economy. Materials allocated for the building of new homes, such as cement and concrete, were diverted for other uses, and bribery and a lack of oversight produced shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings. The underqualified development proved to be vital during the 1988 Armenian earthquake—when the earthquake hit, the Brezhnevka apartments were the most susceptible to collapse, while the older buildings better withstood the quake. When compared to other republics, the regions of Transcaucasia and Central Asia had the highest levels of corruption.
In the more politically liberated climate, new intelligentsia appeared in Armenia who despised the prevailing situation, and felt that &quot;the corruption, emigration of talented individuals, pollution and general loss of ethics had put Armenia on the road to disaster&quot;. Theis anti-Soviet sentiment resulted in the removal of Anton Kochinyan, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia from 1966 until 1974, and the promotion of Karen Demirchyan, whose main prerogative was to &quot;clean up the Republic&quot;. Demirjian promises and activities raised hopes for those Armenians who demanded concrete changes. His government undertook the battle with corruption and established major construction projects, such as the Yerevan Metro, Karen Demirchyan Complex, the new airport. However, Soviet system was too encumbered, and some Armenians believed that Demirjian government delivered their promises too slow.

In 1978, during the debate over a new Soviet Constitution, the Armenians unsuccessfully petitioned Moscow for the separation of Mountainous Karabakh and Nakhichevan from Azerbaijan Republic. Around the same time, Moscow considered removing a part of the constitution that guaranteed the use of native languages as the official languages of the republics, but Armenians, alongside Georgians, fervently protested and defeated the proposition.

In the 1970s a Soviet census revealed that over 99 percent of the people of Armenia (including Kurds, Assyrians, and Azeris) considered Armenian, rather than Russian, their national language, which is much higher than the numbers amassed in other republics. However, only two thirds of the Armenians of the USSR lived in Armenia, with the remaining one-third primarily settling in Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Russia.

=== Glasnost and perestroika ===
Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s introduction of the reforms of &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot; in the 1980s fueled Armenian visions of a better life under Soviet rule. Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, which was promised to Armenia by the Bolsheviks but transferred to Soviet Azerbaijan, began a movement to unite the area with Armenia. The majority Armenian population expressed concern about the forced &quot;Azerification&quot; of the region. On February 20, 1988, the Supreme Soviet of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast voted to unify with Armenia.

Demonstrations took place in Yerevan in support of the Karabakh Armenians, and grew into what became known as the Karabakh movement. By the beginning of 1988, nearly one million Armenians from several regions of the republic engaged in these demonstrations, centered on Yerevan&#x27;s Theater Square (currently Freedom Square). However, in neighboring Azerbaijan, violence against Armenians erupted in the city of Sumgait. Ethnic rioting soon broke out between Armenians and Azeris, preventing any peaceful resolution from taking place. Armenians became increasingly disillusioned with the Kremlin&#x27;s response toward the issue. Gorbachev, who had until then been viewed favorably in Armenia, saw his standing among Armenians deteriorate significantly.

Tension between the central government in Moscow and the local government in Yerevan heightened in the final years of the Soviet Union. The reasons largely stemmed from Moscow&#x27;s perceived indecision on Karabakh, ongoing difficulties with earthquake relief, and the shortcomings of the Soviet economy. On August 23, 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR adopted the Declaration of Independence of Armenia, declaring the Republic of Armenia to be a subject of international law. On 17 March 1991, Armenia, along with the Baltics, Georgia and Moldova, boycotted the union-wide referendum in which 78% of all voters voted for the retention of the Soviet Union in a reformed form. Armenia confirmed its independence in a referendum on 21 September 1991 after the unsuccessful coup attempt in Moscow by the CPSU hardliners.

The republic&#x27;s independence became official with the Belovezh Accords and the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991, making Armenia a sovereign, independent state. The constitution of 1978 remained in effect until July 5, 1995, when a new constitution was adopted.

== Politics ==

The structure of government in the Armenian SSR was identical to that of the other Soviet republics. The First Secretary was the administrative head of the republic, and the head of government was the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The republic&#x27;s legislative body was the Armenian Supreme Soviet, which included the highest judicial branch of the republic, the supreme court. Members of the Supreme Soviet served for a term of five years, whereas regional deputies served for two and a half years. All officials holding office were mandated to be members of the Communist Party and sessions were convened in the Supreme Soviet building in Yerevan.

The administrative divisions of the Armenian SSR from 1930 consisted of up 37 raions and 22 city districts. In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the districts were abolished in 1995 and replaced by larger &quot;marzer&quot; (&quot;provinces&quot;).

Depending on the historical period, Soviet authorities would variously tolerate, co-opt, undermine, or sometimes even attempt to eliminate certain currents within Armenian society, such as nationalism and religion, to strengthen the cohesiveness of the Union. In the eyes of early Soviet policymakers, Armenians, along with Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Georgians, Germans, and Jews were deemed &quot;advanced&quot; (as opposed to &quot;backward&quot;) peoples, and were grouped together with Western nationalities. The Caucasus and particularly Armenia were recognized by academic scholars and in Soviet textbooks as the &quot;oldest civilisation on the territory&quot; of the Soviet Union. By mid-70s, Armenian nationalism had resurfaced, mostly directed against the Turks, and the Demirjian government allowed the not-too-overt expression of it. More books about conditions in Karabakh and the destruction of Armenian monuments in Nakhichevan were published. The &quot;Armenian question&quot; was &quot;raised unofficially in some circles&quot;. The Armenian government formally adopted Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day in 1988.

Like all the other republics of the Soviet Union, Armenia had its own flag and coat of arms. According to Nikita Khrushchev, the latter became a source of dispute between the Soviet Union and Turkey in the 1950s, when Ankara objected the coat of arms that would include Mount Ararat, which holds a deep symbolic importance for Armenians but has been located on Turkish territory since early 20th century. Turkey felt that the presence of such an image implied Soviet designs on Turkish territory. Khrushchev retorted by asking, &quot;Why do you have a moon depicted on your flag? After all, the moon doesn&#x27;t belong to Turkey, not even half the moon. Do you want to take over the whole universe?&quot; Turkey dropped the issue after this.

== Economy ==

Under the centralized economy, the Armenian Republic imposed a ban on private property—beginning in the late 1920s, privately owned farms in Armenia were collectivized and placed under the directive of the state, which was often met with active resistance from the peasantry. The communist society collectively owned the means of production, divided into state property and cooperative and collective-farm property. The economic life of the Republic was determined and guided by the state economic plan.

In the nansent Soviet Armenia eighty percent of its population engaged in agriculture. During the 1929–1936, the government began the process of industrialization in Armenia, and by 1935, the gross product from agriculture reached the 132% and the gross product from industry reached the 650%, both compared to the production in 1928. The economic revolution of the 1930s, however, came with a cost, breaking up the traditional peasant family and village institution and compelling many living in the rural countryside to settle in urban areas. At the time of the republic&#x27;s dissolution, close to 80 percent of its population lived in urban centers and engaged in heavy industry, management, and services.

During Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s secretaryship, the large collective farms were divided into smaller ones, and farmers were permitted to cultivate small plots for their own personal use. Armenia was permitted to plant other crops besides grain—including the production of tobacco, vegetables, grapes and other fruits—more suitable to Armenia&#x27;s soil and climate. The newly-introduced production of livestock and various irrigation projects increased Armenia&#x27;s agricultural output. However, the lack of land suitable for farming meant the republic&#x27;s agricultural output was less compared to other republics.

The Brezhnev era signified the prospering tourism sector, which constituted a substantial fraction of Soviet Armenia&#x27;s economy. Hotels and museums were opened and cultural exchange programs were established.

Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant has been constructed and launched in 1976, satisfying the electricity needs of Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. During this period, the rising industrial output of Armenia, the levels of pollution has increased, which caused the growth in cancer cases, &quot;every major river in Armenia was declared ecologically dead, and poorly planned projects resulted in the lowering of Lake Sevan&#x27;s water level&quot;.

== Military forces ==
The military forces of the Armenian SSR were provided by the Soviet Army&#x27;s 7th Guards Combined Arms Army of the Transcaucasian Military District. It was organized into the following:

* HQ of the 7th Guards Combined Arms Army - Yerevan
* 15th Motor Rifle Division, Kirovakan

<text>Walbrook is a Ward of the City of London and a minor street in its vicinity. The ward is named after a river of the same name.

The ward of Walbrook contains two of the City&#x27;s most notable landmarks: the Bank of England and the Mansion House. The street runs between Cannon Street and Bank junction, though vehicular traffic can only access it via Bucklersbury, a nearby side-road off Queen Victoria Street.

==City ward==

A street called Walbrook runs along the lower part of the brook&#x27;s course. A valley is clearly visible; this can be seen most clearly at the junction of Walbrook and Cannon Street. On the street is the church of St Stephen Walbrook, which originally stood on the west bank of the stream, but was rebuilt around 1439 on the east side. In 1666 the church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London; Christopher Wren built a new church there in 1672, which still stands, to replace it. The Bank of England and the Mansion House, the official residence of the Lord Mayor, are both situated in Walbrook ward, as is the historic London Stone (the latter situated on Cannon Street). Within the ward is also the Walbrook Club, a private dining club founded in 2000; this was designed by Mark Birley of Annabel&#x27;s, and is set in a Queen Anne-style townhouse.

Walbrook is one of 25 wards in the City of London, each electing an Alderman and Commoners (the City equivalent of a Councillor) to the Court of Common Council of the City of London Corporation. Only electors who are Freemen of the City of London are eligible to stand.

==Politics==
The ward is represented in the City of London Corporation by John Garbutt Alderman and the Common Councilmen James Thomson (Deputy) and Peter Bennett.

<doc id="380358" wikidata="Q7601180" url="?curid=380358" title="Star Wars sources and analogues">
<text>The &quot;Star Wars&quot; science fiction media franchise is acknowledged to have been inspired by many sources. These include Hinduism, Buddhism, Qigong, philosophy, classical mythology, Roman history, Gnosticism, Zoroastrianism, parts of the other Abrahamic religions, Confucianism, Shintō and Taoism, and countless cinematic precursors. Creator George Lucas stated &quot;Most of the spiritual reality in the movie[s] is based on a synthesis of all religions. A synthesis through history; the way man has perceived the unknown and the great mystery and tried to deal with that or dealing with it&quot;.

Lucas has also said that chivalry, knighthood, paladinism and related institutions in feudal societies inspired some concepts in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies, most notably the Jedi Knights. The work of the mythologist Joseph Campbell, especially his book &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;, directly influenced Lucas, and is what drove him to create the &quot;modern myth&quot; of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The natural flow of energy known as the Force is believed to have originated from the concept of &quot;qi/chi/ki&quot;, &quot;the all-pervading vital energy of the universe&quot;.

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, The History Channel premiered a two-hour event covering the entire &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga entitled &quot;Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed.&quot; Featuring interviews from the likes of Stephen Colbert, Newt Gingrich, Nancy Pelosi, Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, Peter Jackson, acclaimed scholars and others, the program delved further into the Heroic Epic concept and the influences of mythology and other motifs that were important in making &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Subjects include sins of the father and redeeming the father, coming of age, exiting the ordinary world and others.

==Fictional works similarities and inspirations==
===Literature===
* Joseph Campbell&#x27;s comparative mythology book &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;, directly influenced Lucas, and is what drove him to create the &quot;modern myth&quot; of &quot;Star Wars&quot;.
* E.E. &#x27;Doc&#x27; Smith&#x27;s writings contain elements central to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. These elements include:
** Spherical, moon-sized spaceships.
** Smaller, spherical, jet-less fighters with accumulators for beamed power.
** Spacehounds of IPC includes light swords of slicing &quot;blade of flame&quot; and &quot;planes of force&quot; wielded by spherical ships, also attested in melee combat. 
** Smith&#x27;s Lensmen have the telepathic powers of the Jedi derived from crystalline lenses mirroring Kyber crystals in &quot;Star Wars&quot;.
** In &quot;Triplanetary&quot;, a &quot;tractor beam&quot; from an artificial planetoid captures another vessel and a damsel in distress adventure ensues.
** Space armor with a general focus on melee combat using space axes.
** Norlaminian worship of &quot;the all-controlling Force&quot; along with general use of &quot;force&quot; powers throughout.
** A &quot;Golden Meteor&quot; is the emblem and insignia of the galactic protectors.
** A galactic trade in drugs which are used as currency: Thionite in Smith, Spice in &quot;Star Wars&quot;.
** A galactic corps of heroes with telepathic powers. (Note: &quot;Lensman&quot; was written 10 years before the Silver Age edition of Green Lantern)
** Benevolent guardians seeking to fight evil. (Called &quot;Arisians&quot; in &quot;Lensman&quot;; &quot;Aquillian&quot; in the second draft script for &quot;Star Wars&quot;.)
** A dark, unseen enemy seeking galactic domination. (Called &quot;Boskone&quot; in &quot;Lensman&quot;; &quot;Bogan&quot; in the second draft script for &quot;Star Wars&quot;.)
** Special powers running down through family lines, with twins playing a significant role.
** Epic space battles involving fleets of ships.
** Large-scale weapons including a free-roaming planet-sized fortress and the &quot;sunbeam&quot; (capable of focusing the sun&#x27;s rays, similar to Starkiller Base in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;).
** Jettisoning a space lifeboat with a data spool containing secrets of the enemy&#x27;s ultimate weapon, the &#x27;Grand Base&#x27;.
** Training with a helmet with a blast shield, yet able to &#x27;see&#x27; due to special powers.
** Passing a ship off as a chunk of loose metal.
** Numerous uses of the word &quot;&quot;, a term which had declined in use after the 19th century.
* The science fiction writer Isaac Asimov stated on several occasions that George Lucas&#x27;s galaxy-wide Empire bore a close resemblance to the galaxy depicted in Asimov&#x27;s Foundation Series. The greatest differences are that Asimov&#x27;s Galaxy contains almost no robots and no non-human aliens. Asimov addressed both issues directly in the saga&#x27;s later volumes, most notably &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Edge&quot; and &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot;. Since Asimov&#x27;s death in 1992, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; cinematic universe has gained new Asimovesque elements: &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; introduced the planet Coruscant, which bears a close resemblance to Asimov&#x27;s Trantor.
* The early &quot;Journal of the Whills&quot; draft of &quot;Star Wars&quot; from 1973 is based on the first chapter of the 1931 John Carter novel &quot;A Fighting Man of Mars&quot; by Edgar Rice Burroughs.
* &quot;Star Wars&quot; borrows significantly from Arthurian mythology; especially with respect to plot and main character development. The life and character development of Luke Skywalker resembles that of the legendary King Arthur. Both are orphans who later become heroes in their early adulthood. Both also have mentors who are much older and provide them with guidance and/or training. Arthur was mentored by Merlin; whereas Luke was mentored and trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi prior to continuing his training and mentorship with Yoda. The role of Anakin Skywalker as the father of the hero, Luke Skywalker, mirrors that of Uther Pendragon who is King Arthur&#x27;s father. Qui Gon-Jinn, Master Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi&#x27;s roles match that of Merlin during the era of Anakin Skywalker and Uther Pendragon respectively.
* &quot;Star Wars&quot; shares many similarities with Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;, including the desert planet setting with a moisture-based economy, spice smugglers, obese interstellar antagonists, and a mystical mind control-using sect with great influence over galactic politics — Herbert himself once enumerated 37 similarities. The influence was even more distinct in early &quot;Star Wars&quot; versions, with Princess Leia guarding a shipment of &quot;aura spice&quot; instead of the Death Star plans. The script for &quot;Jodorowsky&#x27;s Dune&quot; was circulating in Hollywood at the time of Lucas&#x27; early work on &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The director of the 2021 movie adaptation of &quot;Dune&quot;, Denis Villeneuve, said the new movie would attempt to be &quot;Star Wars&quot; for adults.

====Pulp heroes and comics====
*Buck Rogers, another hero from pulp magazines from 1920s, and late comic strips (1929–67) and later a 1939 film serial and a 1950–51 TV series. &quot;Star Wars&quot; also influenced from its tropes.

*Flash Gordon is the pulp hero whose original property which George Lucas had sought to license before making the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, &quot;A New Hope&quot;; the film includes many elements derived from the 1936 Universal serial &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot;. The basic plot involving the infiltration of a megalomaniacal outer-space Emperor&#x27;s fortress by two heroes disguised in uniforms of soldiers of his army is drawn from &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot;, with Luke Skywalker and Han Solo filling the roles of Flash Gordon and Prince Barin, respectively, and Ming the Merciless the Emperor. The Emperor&#x27;s deadly, hostile planet (the Death Star/Mongo), a sometimes scantily-clad brunette space Princess whom the hero defends (Princess Leia/Princess Aura), a big, strong, hairy, animal-like ally (Chewbacca/Prince Thun of the Lion Men), a fearsome monster found underground and/or fought in an arena by the hero (the Rancor/the Gocko or Orangopoid), a city in the sky ruled by someone who originally works with the villains but later joins the heroes (Lando Calrissian of Cloud City), ray-guns, and dogfighting spaceships were all elements retained from the first Universal Flash Gordon serial. The opening text crawl of Star Wars is in the same style as the text openings of each chapter of the &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers The Universe&quot; serial. [From the 1940 series, not 1936, and the opening crawl is from the movie Les Disparus de Saint-Agil].
*DC Comics and Jack Kirby. There has been a long debate among fans about the influence that comic book writer Jack Kirby had on the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. Kirby&#x27;s time at DC Comics between 1971 and 1975 was defined by his creation of the New Gods saga. This intergalactic story involved the New God, Orion of the planet New Genesis, being prophesied by the Source as the warrior to defeat Darkseid - the tyrannical ruler of the planet Apokolips, and, by doing so, bring peace to the universe and end the conflict between the two planets. Unknown to Orion was that he was the son of the evil Darkseid. Parallels can thus be drawn between the nature of the relationships between Orion and Darkseid to Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, as well as between the mythical Source and the Force. According to some accounts, Lucas met comic book writer and editor Roy Thomas at a dinner in 1972, during which Lucas described the plot of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, to which Thomas noticed the similarity between this and Kirby&#x27;s New Gods, which was then already a published series. John Williams who made the iconic &quot;Star Wars&quot; soundtracks since 1977, also did the soundtrack for the first &quot;Superman&quot; movie in 1978.
*Marvel Comics: Lucas original trilogy co-writer Lawrence Kasdan noted that the spin-offs were expanding the franchise into more of a shared universe. Far beyond the previously linear saga, adding that one of the strengths of the franchise was how it all fell under the same continuity in comparison to other franchises. Kasdan also contrasted &quot;Star Wars&quot; to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, noting that &quot;Star Wars&quot; features less comedy than the latter, and adding that he felt a more comedic approach like Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; would &quot;not be &quot;Star Wars&quot;&quot; to him.
**Jon Favreau stated that he took what he learned from doing the Marvel adjacent &quot;Iron Man&quot; movies into doing &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; and &quot;Boba Fett&quot; in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, all these characters rely on metallic, high-tech armors that can fly and fire weapons.

====J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;====
J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s 1937 &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and 1954–55 &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; novels inspired George Lucas&#x27;s creation of &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 1977. An early draft for the 1977 &quot;Star Wars&quot; film is said to have included an exchange of dialogue between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker taken directly from the conversation between Gandalf and Bilbo in Chapter 1 of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, where Bilbo/Luke says &quot;Good morning!&quot; and Gandalf/Kenobi replies asking whether he means he&#x27;s having a good morning, or is wishing him one, or that all mornings are good. Bilbl/Luke answers &quot;All of them at once&quot;. The plagiarised dialogue was dropped, but the monk-like Kenobi was modelled on Gandalf; the film author Chris Taylor identifies several further elements of &quot;Star Wars&quot; that in his view could have been modelled on Middle-earth.

While doing a &quot;Star Wars&quot; animated series, Dave Filoni noted that Peter Jackson visited him and his mentor George Lucas to discuss Tolkien&#x27;s works and to ask for advice. According to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; website, Darth Vader is compared by Filoni to the Balrog rather than Sauron, and the Prancing Pony bar may have inspired the Mos Eisley cantina, with the introduction of Han Solo suggestively matching that of Strider (Aragorn). As for the prequel trilogy, it notes that Saruman influenced Count Dooku (both are portrayed by Christopher Lee in the respective movies), and volcanic Mordor, whether Tolkien&#x27;s or Jackson&#x27;s, influenced the volcanic planet Mustafar.

George R. R. Martin acknowledged Tolkien influenced his &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; TV series and novels about medieval fantasy, while speaking about a movie about Tolkien&#x27;s life. Jon Favreau mentioned &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; as an influence on &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;″s second season. George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; / &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; (1996 – present) has been compared to &quot;Star Wars&quot;. This is most commonly through the characters of Luke Skywalker and Jaime Lannister, due to both being sword-fighters who lose their hands in duels, while being knights sworn to celibacy, and also due to their incestuous relationships to their respective sisters, Leia and Cersei (though Luke and Leia were unaware of being siblings, and the Lannisters have children). Both feature mothers who died at child-birth (&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; was written before the release of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;), and arguably evil fathers (though Luke and Leia weren&#x27;t raised by him). Captain Phasma has also been compared as weaker than Brienne of Tharth, due to both sharing the same actress. Many people were in both franchises. Both franchises feature important fights on throne rooms, with Emperor Palpatine&#x27;s throne being compared to the Iron Throne, though Martin&#x27;s works are far more violent.

===Opera===
* &quot;Star Wars&quot; is widely considered to resemble Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; in themes, plot elements, and music.

===Film and television===

*Lucas has specifically cited the fact that he became acquainted with the term &quot;jidaigeki&quot; (&quot;period drama&quot;, the Japanese genre of samurai films) while in Japan, and it is widely assumed that he took inspiration for the term Jedi from this.
* The costume for Darth Vader was visually inspired by the character &quot;The Lightning&quot; in the Republic Pictures serial &quot;The Fighting Devil Dogs&quot;. The Lightning also had an army of white-armored stormtroopers and flew through the sky in a large triangular airship (the &quot;flying wing&quot;).
* Darth Vader&#x27;s need to wear his helmet to breathe recalls the oxygen helmets of the underground-dwelling Muranians in the 1935 Mascot serial &quot;The Phantom Empire&quot;, which are required by the caped Thunder Riders to be able to breathe on the surface.
* &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; features a pod racing action sequence. This entire sequence is inspired by the famous chariot race of &quot;Ben Hur&quot;. The climactic moment when Sebulba&#x27;s Pod attaches itself to Anakin&#x27;s Pod mimics, almost shot for shot, the climactic moment of the scene in &quot;Ben Hur&quot; when Messala accidentally locks wheels with Ben Hur. Lines, scenes and themes from Ben-Hur had already previously influenced the Star Wars films. The conflict between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire is comparable to the earlier film&#x27;s depiction of the historical Roman-Jewish conflict of the time, with an ascendant Roman Empire, represented by Messala, threatening to wipe out the Jewish rebels and send them extinct. The same Chariot sequence also inspired parts of the Endor speeder chase in Return of the Jedi, which also includes a sequence where two speeders accidentally interlock. The film&#x27;s famous early line &quot;The Emperor is displeased, he wishes Judea be made into a more obedient province!&quot; significantly influenced dialogue in all Original Trilogy Star Wars films, with the first four words, in particular, is frequently directly quoted in relation to Star Wars Emperor Palpatine character.
* Lucas has also cited John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Searchers&quot; and David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; as references for the style—if not the story—used in the films. A more direct homage to &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; occurs in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, as Padme and Anakin talk while walking around the Theed palace on Naboo. It was filmed at the Plaza de España in Seville, Spain, which in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; was the site of the British Army headquarters in Cairo, and was shot in an exact manner as the scene in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; where Allenby (Jack Hawkins) and Dryden (Claude Rains) discuss whether to give artillery to Lawrence&#x27;s Arab troops. In the same film, Padme and Anakin also retreat to an estate called Varykino – the name of the Gromeko family estate in &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;. (Some also have considered Tom Courtenay&#x27;s Pasha/Strelnikov character from &quot;Zhivago&quot; as an inspiration for Anakin/Darth Vader, but the similarities are likely coincidental.) Similarly, the chase sequence with Zam Wesell on Coruscant likely references &quot;Blade Runner&quot;; Lucas based many of the Coruscant cityscapes on Los Angeles in 2019. A reference to &quot;The Searchers&quot; occurs in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, when Luke discovers the burning moisture farm, while the Tusken Raiders sequence in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; recalls the climax of &quot;The Searchers&quot;. Han&#x27;s showdown with Greedo in &quot;Star Wars&quot; resembles a scene in another John Ford movie, &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot;.
* Lucas is also a fan of Sergio Leone&#x27;s film &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, and according to Leone&#x27;s biographer, Christopher Frayling, he listened to the score from Leone&#x27;s film while editing &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Many have considered Vader&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;A New Hope&quot; as being an &quot;homage&quot; to the introduction of Henry Fonda&#x27;s villainous Frank in the Leone film.
* The death scene of Yoda in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; is taken almost shot-for-shot from the death scene of the similarly mystical High Lama in Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (Yoda and the High Lama also both share a diminutive form and odd cadence of speech).
* The attack on the Death Star in the climax of the film &quot;A New Hope&quot; is similar in many respects to the strategy of Operation Chastise from the 1954 British film, &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;. Rebel pilots have to fly through a trench while evading enemy fire and drop a single special weapon at a precise distance from the target to destroy the entire base with a single explosion; if one run fails another run must be made by a different pilot. Some scenes from the &quot;A New Hope&quot; climax are similar to those in &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; and some of the dialogue is nearly identical in the two films. These scenes are also heavily influenced by the action scenes from the fictional wartime film &quot;633 Squadron&quot;. That film&#x27;s finale shows the squadron&#x27;s planes flying down a deep fjord while being fired at along the way by anti-aircraft guns lining its sides. George Lucas has stated in interviews that this sequence inspired the &#x27;trench run&#x27; sequence in &quot;Star Wars&quot;.
*Francis Ford Coppola – Lucas based the friendship between Luke Skywalker and Han Solo on his own friendship with Francis Ford Coppola. In &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, during Anakin&#x27;s massacre on Mustafar, the slaughter of the Separatist Council and the declaration of the Galactic Empire are reminiscent of the montage of massacres during the christening scene of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, a film directed by Coppola. They are similar in that the christening of one (the baby and the Empire) with the death of a group of others (the other dons and the Separatists). Post-Lucas director Rian Johnson inspired one of the final shots of &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; where the Millennium Falcon door closes, on the final scene of &quot;The Godfather&quot; where a door closes on Michael Corleone. While, Lucas wanted the sequel trilogy Luke Skywalker inspired on the cynic Colonel Kurtz from Coppolla&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.
* The Maschinenmensch – the robot in Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1927 film &quot;Metropolis&quot; – inspired the look of C-3PO, although the Maschinenmensch is a gynoid whereas C-3PO has masculine programming.
* Ray Harryhausen used stop motion animation to create a mechanical owl, Bubo, in &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; (1981). Despite Bubo&#x27;s similarities (Bubo is metallic and expresses by whistling and rotating its head) to the droid R2-D2 of the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Harryhausen claimed Bubo was created before &quot;Star Wars&quot; was released.
* Lucas used the term &quot;the Force &quot; to &quot;echo&quot; its use by cinematographer Roman Kroitor in &quot;21-87&quot; (1963), in which Kroitor says, &quot;Many people feel that in the contemplation of nature and in communication with other living things, they become aware of some kind of force, or something, behind this apparent mask which we see in front of us, and they call it God&quot;. Although Lucas had Kroitor&#x27;s line in mind specifically, Lucas said the underlying sentiment is universal and that &quot;similar phrases have been used extensively by many different people for the last 13,000 years&quot;.

====Akira Kurosawa====
Akira Kurosawa films:
* &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; (1958) &quot;A New Hope&quot; features the exploits of C-3PO and R2-D2, whereas the plot of &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; is told from the point of view of two bickering peasants. The two peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, are first shown escaping a battle, while C-3PO and R2-D2 are first shown fleeing an attack in &quot;A New Hope&quot;. Additionally, both films feature a battle-tested General – Rokurota Makabe in &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; and Obi-Wan Kenobi in &quot;A New Hope&quot; – who assist a rebellion led by a princess and engage in a duel with a former rival whom they fought years earlier. Lucas also features many horizontal wipe scene transitions in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, a technique used thoroughly by Kurosawa in his films. Similarly, the Princess trades places with a slave girl in &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;, with the slave girl acting as a decoy for the real Princess. In &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, Queen Amidala trades places with one of her handmaidens who acts as a decoy.
* &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (1961) inspired the brawl scene in the Cantina. Its sequel &quot;Sanjuro&quot; (1962) inspired the hiding-under-the-floor trick.
**&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; which is Sergio Leone&#x27;s first film in &quot;Dollars trilogy&quot;, is an unofficial remake of the Kurosawa film &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, that also inspired George Lucas. Clint Eastwood&#x27;s cowboy character without a name, also inspired the post-Lucas created main character of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, and also the Lucas created character Cad Bane from &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; animated series. (Though the episode &quot;Hostage Crisis&quot; that introduced Cad Bane, has the character also inspired on Hans Gruber, the villain of &quot;Die Hard&quot;, with its plot also being a loose remake of the Bruce Willis film).
***&quot;Django&quot; another unofficial western remake of &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, inspired Lucas on the name of his character Jango Fett.
* &quot;Dersu Uzala&quot; (1975), just two years before the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie, there are two scenes that bear a striking resemblance to scenes in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The first is the Captain and Dersu looking out over the horizon, seeing both the setting sun and the rising moon at the same time. This is much like when Luke Skywalker stares out on the sky with binary suns in &quot;A New Hope&quot;. The other scene is when Dersu and the Captain are suddenly caught in a blizzard, and they have to quickly build a shelter to spend the night, to survive the cold. The Captain collapses from the cold and Dersu has to drag and stuff him into the shelter. This is similar to the scene in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; where Han Solo cuts a tauntaun open with Luke&#x27;s lightsaber and stuffs the unconscious Luke into it, when they get caught in a blizzard on the snow planet Hoth. A similar moment using a horse, happens in &quot;The Revenant (2015 film)&quot;, than won an Oscar to Leonardo DiCaprio for playing 1700s frontier man Hugh Glass.
*&quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950): On &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), from post-George Lucas director Rian Johnson. The Rashomon effect, is described on the part where Rey is told by Luke, a description of how he considered murdering his nephew Ben Solo in his sleep, due to feeling his inevitable fall to the dark side of The Force. Then Solo, who by that point had renamed himself as Kylo Ren, tells his perspective, which causes Luke to tell a third perspective of the event. All whom cause a reinterpretation of a similar event in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.
*&quot;Seven Samurai&quot; also inspired an episode of &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; animated series, and the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic with an original plot, that wasn&#x27;t adapted from the film. &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; released its &quot;Chapter 4: Sanctuary&quot; has also been compared to &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;.

====&quot;Star Trek&quot;====

George Lucas claims he became a fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot; when the original series broadcast in the late 1960s which played an influence on the development of &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 1977. Lucas claimed he also visited &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions. The filmmaker amazed Clint Howard by, during an audition, immediately citing his role 15 years earlier as Balok from &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot;. Howard said that he wanted to yell &quot;Get a life&quot; at the filmmaker.

====The original films&#x27; influence on the franchise after Disney buys Lucasfilm====
Following the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney, and the release of the 2015 film &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, a Whatculture.com writer noticed the film bore many parallels and similar plot beats to &quot;A New Hope&quot;. McGill University computer science professor Derek Ruths ran an algorithm that found that, while it was not a one to one translation (for instance, Rey and Kylo Ren did not mirror Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader), the script mirrored &quot;A New Hope&quot; a lot in the way that each film&#x27;s characters were grouped.

==Real world history==

===Ancient and medieval history===

* Ancient and medieval history play amongst the strongest and significant influences on &quot;Star Wars&quot; which reflects ancient Earth history in its settings, including architectural, social and hierarchical structures (i.e. the existence of monarchies and empires) as well as story lines which reflect ancient and medieval history. The transformation of the Old Republic into the Galactic Empire parallels that of the Roman Republic which transformed into the Roman Empire in the same manner of conspiracy and manipulation. Lucas was quoted as saying: &quot;I love history, so while the psychological basis of &quot;Star Wars&quot; is mythological, the political and social bases are historical&quot;.
* Author Nick Jamilla explains that unlike mainstream futuristic stories, with &quot;Star Wars&quot;, George Lucas ties in science fiction with ancient history, comparing the Jedi to the Samurai and historical European swordsmanship. He also parallels the spiritual aspects of the Jedi to eastern monks and philosophy.
* &quot;Star Wars&quot; reflects ancient history in its planetary settings. For example, the planet Coruscant imitates Ancient Rome as the capital of the Old Republic and later the Galactic Empire; whereas Tatooine (referring to Tataouine - a province south of Tunis in Tunisia, roughly where Lucas filmed for the planet) imitates the ancient Middle East (specifically the Arabian Peninsula) and North Africa in ancient times as being barren desert and sparsely populated (which it still is today to a certain degree). Coruscant and Naboo are also two of many planets in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy which exhibit architecture inspired by those of ancient Greece, Rome, and other ancient Mediterranean and southern/southeastern European societies.
* In his book &quot;The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy&quot;, author Tom Henthorne argues that 1970s science fiction movies such as the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and &quot;E.T.&quot; bring back neo-medieval themes at young boys with a masculine tone in his view. He argues the knighthood-type plots give a sense of encouragement to young boys and give girls the image of being their prizes or captives waiting to be rescued.
* The Samurai warriors of Japan are somewhat parallel to the concept of the Jedi as an elite warrior class specialized in combat and swordsmanship techniques charged with protecting their respective societies.
* The aesthetic of Jedi uniforms is borrowed from the styles of clothing worn by North African Tribesmen and various Sufi brotherhoods. It has been argued by some that the name &quot;Jedi&quot; itself actually comes from the Arabic &quot;Al-Jeddi&#x27;&quot; which means &quot;master of the mystic-warrior way.&quot; 
* In an interview with &#x27;The Muslim Magazine,&#x27; Dhul-Nun Owen spoke about George Lucas contacting members of the Habibiyyah Sufi Order in Berkeley, CA in order to do research for &#x27;Star Wars.&#x27; However, there isn&#x27;t a record of Lucas confirming this himself. 
* Mahmoud Shelton of Stanford University wrote an article titled &quot;Star Wars: A Tale of Spiritual Chivalry” wherein he explores the connection between the Order of the Jedi and the Orders of Futuwwa (Mediaeval Sufi Chivalry). Shelton maintains that the Skywalker story may be specifically compared to the Ancient Egyptian myth of Osiris and his son Horus, and that the word &quot;Jedi&quot; is related to the Djed through the imagery of the prequels.

===Modern and early modern history===
The stormtroopers from the movies share a name with the Imperial German stormtroopers and the Nazi German Sturmabteilung (lit. Stormtrooper). Imperial officers&#x27; uniforms also resemble some historical German Army uniforms and the political and security officers of the Empire resemble the black clad SS down to the imitation silver death&#x27;s head insignia on their officer&#x27;s caps (although the uniforms technically had more basis with the German Uhlans within the Prussian Empire). World War II terms were used for names in &quot;Star Wars&quot;; examples include the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group of encircled forces) and Hoth (Hermann Hoth was a German general who served on the snow-laden Eastern Front). Lucas himself has drawn parallels between Palpatine and his rise to power to historical dictators such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Adolf Hitler, saying the films exist as an examination of how democracies allow themselves to become dictatorships. The space battles in &quot;A New Hope&quot; were based on filmed World War I and World War II dogfights.

Continuing the use of Nazi inspiration for the Empire, J. J. Abrams, the director of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, has said that the First Order, an Imperial offshoot which serves as the main antagonist of the sequel trilogy, is also inspired by another aspect of the Nazi regime. Abrams spoke of how several Nazis fled to Argentina after the war and he claims that the concept for the First Order came from conversations between the scriptwriters about what would have happened if they had started working together again (&quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot;).

In a 2005 interview, George Lucas was asked the origins of the name &quot;Darth Vader&quot;, and replied: &quot;Darth is a variation of dark. And Vader is a variation of father. So it&#x27;s basically Dark Father.&quot; (&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, June 2, 2005). &quot;Vader&quot; is the Dutch word for &quot;father&quot; (the Dutch word is instead pronounced &quot;fah-der&quot;), and the German word for &quot;father&quot; (&quot;Vater&quot;) is similar. However, in the earliest scripts for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the name &quot;Darth Vader&quot; was given to a human Imperial general with no apparent relationships.

Commentators have noted the strong political analogies in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe to contemporary American politics. Major analogies include Lucas&#x27;s opposition to the Vietnam War being seen in the original trilogy. Lucas even said in 2005 that &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;was really about the Vietnam War, and that was the period where Richard Nixon was trying to run for a [second] term, which got me to thinking historically about how do democracies get turned into dictatorships. Because the democracies aren&#x27;t overthrown; they&#x27;re given away.&quot; This claim was likewise backed up by the 1973 draft for the first movie, then-called &quot;The Star Wars&quot;, where Lucas specifically mentioned that the theme involved an independent planet named Aquillae that was compared to North Vietnam, and that the Empire was &quot;America 10 years from now&quot;, and by Walter Murch, who claimed Lucas, after his failure with &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, decided to do &quot;Star Wars&quot; as a way to channel the anti-war and pro-Vietcong ideology in a disguised form. Ian McDiarmid, when recalling something Lucas told him during filming of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, also implied that the Oval Office, and in particular, Nixon&#x27;s presidency, played a role in the design of the Emperor&#x27;s throne room. Political themes in &quot;Rogue One&quot; have also been noted.

The political and military conflict of the prequel films, especially &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, bears a strong similarity to elements of the American Civil War (1861–1865): the Galactic Republic&#x27;s Clone army (officially called the &quot;Grand Army of the Republic&quot;) represents the Union Army (whose veteran organization was named Grand Army of the Republic), while the Confederacy of Independent Systems mimics the Confederate States of America (also abbreviated as &quot;the Confederacy&quot;). The character of Count Dooku is directly based on Confederate General Robert E. Lee.

<text>William Garden Blaikie FRSE (5 February 1820, in Aberdeen – 11 June 1899) was a Scottish minister, writer, biographer, and temperance reformer.

==Life==
His father James Ogilvie Blaikie was the first Provost of Aberdeen following its reformed corporation. After studying at Marischal College, where Alexander Bain and David Masson were among his contemporaries, he went in 1839 to Edinburgh to complete his theological studies under Thomas Chalmers. In 1842 he was presented to the parish of Drumblade as their minister by the Earl of Kintore, to whose family he was connected. The Disruption of 1843 reached its climax immediately afterwards, and Blaikie was one of the 474 ministers who signed the deed of demission and gave up their livings. 

He found a brief position as Free Church minister of Turriff 1843/44 before being translated to Pilrig Free Church on the boundary between Leith and Edinburgh. This was agreed in January 1844 and his first service was on 1 March 1844. The church was the second purpose-built church for the Free Church and was designed by a congregation member, David Cousin. Elders of the church included Francis Brown Douglas.

Blaikie remained minister of Pilrig until 1868, overseeing the building of a new and more lavish Free Church on the corner opposite the original church, this being designed in 1865 by the architects Peddie &amp; Kinnear, together with a new purpose-built manse on Pilrig Street. Keenly interested in questions of social reform, his first publication was a pamphlet, which was afterwards enlarged into a book called &quot;Better Days for Working People&quot;. It received public commendation from Lord Brougham, and 60,000 copies were sold. He formed an association for providing better homes for working people, and the Pilrig Model Buildings were erected. He also undertook the editorship of the &quot;Free Church Magazine&quot;, and then that of the &quot;North British Review&quot;, which he carried on until 1863. In 1864 he was asked to undertake the Scottish editorship of the &quot;Sunday Magazine&quot;, and much of his subsequent writing was done for this magazine, especially in the editorial notes.

In 1862, when he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh he was living at 9 Palmerston Road, a very large villa in the Grange, Edinburgh.

In 1868, Blaikie was asked to fill the chair of apologetics and pastoral theology at New College, Edinburgh. His position at Pilrig Free Church was filled by Rev James Calder Macphail. Blaikie subsequently was a Professor of Divinity there until 1897. In 1870 he was one of two representatives chosen from the Free Church of Scotland to attend the united general assembly of the Presbyterian churches of the United States. He prolonged his visit, made by a similar tour in Europe, and became the real founder of the Presbyterian Alliance. In 1892 he was elected to the chairmanship of the general assembly, the last of the moderators who had entered the church before the disruption. In 1897 he resigned his professorship.

He died at home, 2 Tantallon Terrace, North Berwick, on 11 June 1899. He is buried in Rosebank Cemetery on Pilrig Street, Edinburgh, against the central north-facing retaining wall.

Blaikie was a temperance reformer, and raised money for the relief of the Waldensian churches. He welcomed Dwight L. Moody to Scotland, and the evangelist made his headquarters with him during his first visit.

==Family==

He was married to Margaret Catherine Biggar (1823–1915) from Banff. She became the long-standing president (for 29 years) of the Scottish Christian Union (a women&#x27;s temperance group, independent but associated with the British Women&#x27;s Temperance Association) and was involved with the Women&#x27;s Foreign Missionary Society; together the Baikies established an &#x27;emigration home&#x27; , which from 1871–91, &#x27;rescued&#x27; 700 children from the families of &#x27;destitute drunks&#x27; and re-homed 300 of these to Canada.

Their own children included Walter Biggar Blaikie, engineer, printer and astronomer, and Robert Henry Blaikie (1857–1933), a surgeon.

<text>A spraydeck (sprayskirt in N. America, akuilisaq or tuiitsoq in Greenland) is a flexible waterproof cover for a boat (in particular for a kayak or a canoe) with holes for the passengers&#x27; waists. Spraydecks are used to prevent water from entering the boat while allowing passengers to paddle or row.

Spraydecks are used in breaking waves, on whitewater, in inclement weather, and in splashy sports. An alternative is the tuilik.

==Construction==

A spraydeck is made of water-tight cloth or neoprene. It is sized to fit over the opening, or cockpit, of the canoe or kayak, with holes for the waists of the passengers. The spraydeck generally seals around the rim of the cockpit and around the torso of each passenger.

Each opening in a spraydeck must make a fairly watertight seal. The seal varies in quality. The deck can be made to seal in several ways, including elastic fabric, a hem containing an elastic cord and/or drawstring, and both.

==Boat types==
===Kayak spraydeck===
Spraydecks are worn by many kayakers in most conditions, but especially on rough water and in inclement weather, to prevent water entering the kayak&#x27;s cockpit and to help the kayaker roll. 

On a kayak, the spraydeck is secured to a rim surrounding the cockpit with a line or elastic string called a rand. The line or string often runs inside the hem along the edge of the spraydeck. Alternatively elastic cord is attached directly to the edge of the spraydeck, and is tightened around the rim of the kayak&#x27;s cockpit or stretched over it. 

The fastening may be pulled tight or held so by its elasticity, this prevents water infiltration while allowing the kayaker to quickly release it if the boat should capsize: a so-called wet exit. To aid easy release during a capsize, a grab loop is attached at the front of the spraydeck, which the kayaker can use to pull the spraydeck free. A properly sealed spraydeck will allow a kayaker to perform an eskimo roll and continue paddling without having to bail out.

A kayaker&#x27;s spraydeck is also known as a &quot;sprayskirt&quot;, because it is donned like a skirt before entering the boat. &quot;Sprayskirt&quot; is the more common term in the US.

Spraydecks for traditional kayaks are narrower, to fit narrow custom-fitted cockpits; mass-produced kayaks have larger cockpits and the spraydeck must therefore be wider at the hem.

===Canoe spraydeck===

On a canoe, the spraydeck is secured to the outside of the hull with string or cords to either adhered or riveted installation loops or a perimeter webbing band specifically installed for this purpose. Modern designs have many features for safety and convenience such as map and paddle pockets, access openings, and tie-down straps.

Like a kayak, a spray deck can help allow a canoeist to perform a roll (provided he/she is strapped to the canoe) and continue paddling without having to bail out. But this maneuver is much more difficult and requires advanced skills.

On a canoe, it is not only a safety item but may also be used for comfort. During rainy, windy and or cold weather, it keeps the lower body of the canoeist drier, warmer, and helps prevent water from building up a puddle at the bottom of the boat.

==Materials==
The most appropriate material depends on the temperature/time of year and on the type of water being paddled. Whitewater spraydecks are made totally from neoprene, whereas flatwater touring/sea kayak spraydecks may be made from either material.

=== Sealskin ===
Sealskin is a traditional material for spraydecks. It requires labor-intensive preparation. A European description: 
In fair weather the kaiak-man uses the so-called half-jacket (akuilisak). This is made of water-tight skin with the hair removed, and is sewn with sinews. Round its lower margin runs a draw-string, or rather a draw-thong, by means of which the edge of the jacket can be made to fit so closely to the edge of the kaiak-ring that it can only be pressed and down down over it with some little trouble. This done, the half-jacket forms, as it were, a water-tight extension of the kaiak. The upper part of the jacket comes close up to the armpits of the kaiak-man, and is supported by braces or straps, which pass over the shoulders and can be lengthened or shortened by means of handy runners or buckles of bone, so simple and yet so ingenious that we, with all our metal buckles and so forth, cannot equal them. Loose sleeves of skin are drawn up over the arms, and are lashed to the overarm and to the wrist, thus preventing the arm from becoming wet. Watertight mittens of skin are drawn over the hands. This half-jacket is enough to keep out the smaller waves which wash over the kaiak. In a heavier sea, on the other hand, a whole-jacket (tuilik) is used. This is made in the same way as the half-jacket, and, like it, fits close to the kayak-ring, but is longer above, has sleeves attached to it, and a hood that comes right over the head. It is laced tight around the face and wrists, so that with it on the kaiak-man can go right through the breakers and can capsize and right himself again, without getting wet and without letting a drop of water into the kaiak.

—Fridtjof Nansen, &quot;Eskimo Life&quot;, 1893, English translation by William Archer
=== Gut ===

Sprayskirts (and tuiliks) can also be made of gut from the intestines of sea mammals or bears. The gut is turned inside-out to clean both sides, then inflated to dry. Inflated gut dries quickly. If it is dried in cold, dark, windy weather, it becomes opaque and white, and is known as &quot;winter gut&quot;. &quot;Summer gut&quot; is yellowish and transparent, and stiffer. The gut is then slit open lengthwise and the strips are sewn into a garment. The smoother inside of the gut becomes the outside of the garment.

===Neoprene===

Neoprene spray decks are snug, elastic, and tight fitting on the kayak or canoe cockpit, and have very little or no leakage when well fitted. They sit tight across the cockpit rim with little sag, so water sheds quickly rather than pools on their surface. They typically remain in place during water impact better than other types, so are the usual choice for white water rivers, surf, and sea kayaking. They remain in place during paddler actions of rolling and bracing. They are warm to wear, due to the neoprene tube around waist and lower trunk. They come in many sizes, to suit the shape and size of the cockpit rim and the waist of the wearer. The rim of a neoprene spray deck is elasticated, typically with either shock cord, or a rubber/elastomer rand. Models designed for casual use to just prevent splashes from entering the craft will typically have light shock-cord, making them easy to fit. Models designed for severe use such as for descending waterfalls are heavily elasticated so they remain in place, but require significant arm strength to fit. Neoprene spray decks may be fitted with additional reinforcement of wear resistant fabric on the front part of the deck, to reduce damage during boat-to-boat rescue and emptying.

=== Nylon ===

Nylon spraydecks are easy to attach, easy to remove, offer adequate seal to keep water out, comfortable, sometimes breathable, sometimes waterproof and are used during warmer conditions. They will either have neoprene or nylon for the torso. Nylon spraydecks are less commonly used during rough conditions as they are not as tightly fitted so are more likely to accidentally become free. Permeable cloth is polyurethane-coated or teflon-coated to waterproof it.

=== Other materials ===

Some spraydecks are made from both nylon and neoprene. Whitewater spraydecks often have additional features to ensure the best seal and greatest robustness. Latex may be coated on the underside of the deck to grip the cockpit better and/or a protective material (e.g. Kevlar) added to the surface of the deck to provide abrasion resistance.

<doc id="380375" wikidata="Q3736710" url="?curid=380375" title="Lyman Gilmore">
<text>Lyman Wiswell Gilmore, Jr. (June 11, 1874 – February 18, 1951) was an aviation pioneer. In Grass Valley, California, he built a steam-powered airplane and claimed that he flew it on May 15, 1902. Due to the requirement of a heavy boiler and the dependency on coal as a power source, the flights would have been unsustainable. Records and evidence relating to his claim were lost in a 1935 hangar fire.

== First flight ==
Gilmore, in a 1936 interview, reported a successful tethered glider flight in 1893 and a free glider flight in 1894. Gilmore further added that (although he had not reported it until 1927) he made a controlled steam-powered flight on May 15, 1902; however, all records and papers related to his aircraft were destroyed in a fire.

There are photographs from 1898 showing Gilmore&#x27;s machine, but none showing it in the air. The claims of the aircraft achieving flight are unconfirmed, and given the weight evident by the grounded aircraft photos, the possibility of flight is highly unlikely.

== Work ==
Lyman Gilmore was in contact with other flight pioneers like Samuel Langley and, eventually, the Wright brothers.

In 1902, Gilmore was granted two patents on steam engines. He invented in other areas too: for example, a rotary snowplow. On March 15, 1907, Gilmore opened the first commercial airfield, Gilmore Airfield, in Grass Valley. There is now a middle school named in his honor on the site of the airfield.

In 1935, Lyman&#x27;s airplane hangar and the two aging monoplanes were destroyed by fire. The fire cancelled plans to exhibit the larger monoplane at the World Fair in Chicago. Gilmore began mining for gold and died a poor man in Nevada City, California. His grave can be found in Pine Grove Cemetery, about a half mile outside of town.

The Lyman Gilmore Middle School in Grass Valley has the motto, &quot;Flying into the Future&quot; and a mural depicting first flight. School children made a YouTube presentation about Gilmore including old video footage of Gilmore and an interview with people who knew him.

<doc id="380377" wikidata="Q334679" url="?curid=380377" title="Natsagiin Bagabandi">
<text>Natsagiin Bagabandi (; born 22 April 1950) is a Mongolian politician who served as the 2nd President of Mongolia from 1997 to 2005. He won the 1997 presidential election and subsequently the 2001 presidential election, serving a total of two terms. Prior to running for president, he served as the Chairman of the State Great Khural from 1992 to 1996 and the Secretary General of the Party Leadership Council of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (now known as the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party) from February to June 1997.

He was the first person to be the director of Oyu Tolgoi LLC, serving from 2010 to 2013 and then again from 2016 to 2023.

==Early life and career==
Bagabandi was born on 22 April 1950 in Zavkhan, Mongolia as the 5th child of a herder family. In 1979 he joined the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party. He studied in Leningrad (Leningrad Technical School of the Refrigeration Industry), Ukraine (Odessa Technological Institute of the Food Industry) and Moscow (Academy of Social Sciences at the Central Committee of the CPSU), and graduated in Food engineering. In 1987, he received a doctorate in Philosophy. He became Chairman of the State Great Khural in 1992, serving for four years.

In early 1997, he became General Secretary of the MPRP, shortly before the presidential elections, which were held in difficult conditions for the party as it had lost to the Democratic Union Coalition prior in the 1996 parliamentary election. The DUC had won 50 seats out of 76 in the State Great Khural while the MPRP had only won 25 seats.

However, Bagabandi won the 1997 presidential election with 62.53% of the vote, defeating his predecessor Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat who had won 30.65% of the vote. He became the 2nd President of Mongolia and the 1st President to be elected from the MPRP. He won re-election in 2001 with 59.19% of the vote, beating Radnaasümbereliin Gonchigdorj by a margin of 12%. He was the first Mongolian president to win a second term.

== Presidency (1997-2005) ==

=== Unstable government ===

In his first 4 years in office, he overlooked a total of 4 DUC prime ministers, frequent scandals and government crises. His first PM, Mendsaikhany Enkhsaikhan, the 17th Prime Minister of Mongolia, serving from July 1996, resigned in April 1998 due to growing tensions between him and other party leaders in the DUC. 

The State Great Khural elected (61-6) the chairman of the DUC, Tsaikhiagiin Elbegdorj, arguing that the leader of the winning party in the 1996 election should be the prime minister. In 1998, following Elbegdorj&#x27;s decision to sell the state-owned Reconstruction Bank to Golomt Bank, the minority MPRP called for the resignation of Elbegdorj and soon after, he lost the no confidence vote. 

The DUC nominated Davaadorjiin Ganbold seven times, Galsanpuntsagiin Gankhuyag and Erdeniin Bat-Üül a couple of times to be the next PM but on each occasion, President Bagabandi rejected it. During the ensuing government crisis, prominent figure of the 1990 Revolution and Member of Parliament, Sanjaasürengiin Zorig was assassinated in October, thousands mourned his death and to this day, the case still remains unsolved. Elbegdorj stayed in office until Janlavyn Narantsatsralt was nominated and accepted by the president in late 1998. However, Narantsatsralt was forced to resign from office in 1999 due to backlash from a controversial letter to the Russian Federation. Rinchinnyamyn Amarjargal succeeded him and served as PM for a year until the 2000 parliamentary elections. 

The MPRP secured an overwhelming supermajority in the 2000 elections and won 72 seats out of 76. The DUC lost 49 seats and won only a single seat in the State Great Khural. Chairman of the MPRP, Nambaryn Enkhbayar became the 21st Prime Minister of Mongolia and served full term. He would later on be elected to succeed Bagabandi in the 2005 presidential election, with 54.17% of the vote. 

=== Foreign policy ===
On 13 November 2000, President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin made a historic visit to Mongolia at the invitation of President Bagabandi, which re-strengthened the bilateral relations between the two countries. This was the first visit made by a Russian head of state since Leonid Brezhnev in 1974. Price of russian fuel exports to Mongolia was lowered and bilateral economic cooperation was expanded following the signing of the Ulan Bator Declaration the next day.

On 29 September 2003, President Bagabandi made an address to the 58th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. In his speech, he supported the reforms in the UN, establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Korean Peninsula and among other things.
During a period of remarkable developments in the relationship between the United States and Mongolia, Many visits and meetings between the two sides were made during Bagabandi&#x27;s presidency.

One such notable visit was on July 15, 2004 when President Bagabandi made a momentous visit to the United States at the invitation of then President of the United States, George W. Bush. During his visit, the two sides discussed about a wide range of bilateral issues from combatting global terrorism to promoting democracy and expanding trade and economic cooperation. He also visited the Pentagon and was greeted by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard B. Myers, who visited Ulaanbaatar prior in January.

=== Peacekeeping missions ===
Mongolia took extensive steps in developing its peacekeeping capabilities and by the orders of President and Commander-in-chief Bagabandi, the newly founded 150th Battalion was chosen for the preparation for peacekeeping missions. 

In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Mongolia became one of the 48 countries in support for the US-led &quot;Coalition of the willing&quot; in the US 2003 Iraq Invasion and showed remarkable commitments in peacekeeping despite its small size. This was the first active deployment made by the Mongolian Armed Forces in the 21st century.

== Personal life ==
He is married with two children.

After the end of his presidential term, Bagabandi became a low-profile figure in politics and published several volume of books about meditation and philosophy, called &quot;Crown Words&quot; (Mongolian: Титэм Үгс,

<doc id="380384" wikidata="Q215782" url="?curid=380384" title="Andranik Margaryan">
<text>Andranik Nahapeti Margaryan (; 12 June 1951 – 25 March 2007) was an Armenian politician who served as the Prime Minister of Armenia from 12 May 2000, when the President appointed him, until his death on 25 March 2007. He was a member of the Republican Party of Armenia. He succeeded the Sargsyan brothers: Vazgen Sargsyan, who was murdered during the Armenian parliament shooting on 27 October 1999 and Aram Sargsyan, whom the President appointed a week later, but fired on 2 May 2000.

== Soviet Armenia ==
Andranik Margaryan was born on 12 June 1949 in Yerevan (in what was then the Armenian SSR of the Soviet Union) to a family of Armenian genocide survivors originally from Sason, Turkey. He studied cybernetics at the Yerevan Polytechnic University and graduated as a computer engineer. He first became engaged in Armenian politics in the late 1970s when he joined an illegal political party, the National United Party, that was campaigning for Armenia&#x27;s secession from the Soviet Union. He has served on the National United Party&#x27;s board since 1973. Margaryan had been a longtime critic of the totalitarian government of the Soviet Union. He envisioned an independent, democratic Armenia. Police arrested him in 1974 and a court sentenced him to two years in Soviet labor camps for proliferating unpatriotic ideas and activities.

== Armenian independence ==
In 1992 after Armenia&#x27;s independence, Margaryan became a registered member of the Republican Party of Armenia (HHK), the first registered party in the 3rd Republic of Armenia. He influenced the party platform with the ideology he expressed as a member of the National United Party. He served as the Republican Party&#x27;s Chairman of the Board from 1993 until his death. He had also been a member of the &quot;Yerkrapah&quot; Volunteer union since 1996 and served on the YVU&#x27;s board.

In 2000 he was appointed Prime Minister of Armenia after the 1999 Armenian parliament shooting led to the murder of then prime minister Vazgen Sargsyan. Vazgen&#x27;s brother, Aram Sargsyan, who the President appointed a week later as prime minister, was fired on 2 May 2000, leading to Andranik Markaryan being appointed as the 14th prime minister of Armenia. He had planned to resign after the 12 May 2007, elections in Armenia. Throughout his career, he was awarded the “Garegin Nzhdeh” medal by the Armenian Defense Ministry alongside the “Aram Manukian”, “Fridtjof Nansen” and “Vazgen Sargsyan” medals.

== Heart problems and death ==
Andranik Margaryan died of a heart attack on 25 March 2007, after nearly seven years in office, the second prime minister of Armenia to die in office and the first not related to an assassination. The head of Yerevan&#x27;s municipal ambulance service reported that the prime minister was unconscious and his heart had stopped beating by the time two ambulance crews arrived at his apartment early in the afternoon. Margaryan was immediately given resuscitation treatment but did not respond.

Margaryan had a history of serious cardiac problems and twice underwent heart surgery, first in Armenia in 1999 and later in France. He regularly visited French and Russian clinics for medical examinations.

Andranik Margaryan is survived by a wife, two daughters, one son, and five grandchildren. In November 2011 his son Taron was elected Mayor of Yerevan.

== Career outside politics ==
Apart from politics, Margaryan has also followed a career in scientific research. From 1972 until his arrest in 1974, he worked at the Yerevan branch of Scientific-Research Institute of Gas Industry as a senior engineer. After his release from the Soviet labor camps in 1977, he worked at the Scientific-Research Institute of Energy as chief engineer before moving on to find work in the Energy-Technical Factory as head of department in 1978. From 1979 to 1990, he worked at the Information Counting Centre of the Trade Ministry as the head of department of electronics.
From 1990 to 1994 he was the head of the information department at the State Department of Special Programs. He then settled to work in Armenia&#x27;s State Architectural University as junior scientist from 1994 to 1995.

<doc id="380387" wikidata="Q680304" url="?curid=380387" title="Lady Louise Windsor">
<text>Lady Louise Alice Elizabeth Mary Mountbatten-Windsor (born 8 November 2003) is the elder child and daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, and Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh. She is the youngest niece of King Charles III. She was born during the reign of her paternal grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, at which time she was 8th in line to the British throne. She is currently 17th in line.

==Birth and baptism==
Louise was born prematurely on 8 November 2003 at 23:32 GMT at Frimley Park Hospital in Frimley, Surrey, after her mother, Sophie, who was then Countess of Wessex, was rushed there by ambulance from their home at Bagshot Park, Surrey. Louise&#x27;s father, Prince Edward, then Earl of Wessex, was not present for the birth because it occurred suddenly and while he was on an official visit to Mauritius. Louise was delivered by emergency Caesarean section due to placental abruption, which caused severe blood loss to both child and mother. Louise was transferred to a neo-natal unit in St George&#x27;s Hospital, Tooting, London, as a precaution. Meanwhile, her mother remained at Frimley Park until she was well enough to be discharged, on 23 November 2003. Her name, Louise Alice Elizabeth Mary, was announced on 27 November.

Lady Louise was baptised in the Private Chapel of Windsor Castle on 24 April 2004 by David Conner, the Dean of Windsor; her godparents are Lady Sarah Chatto, Lord Ivar Mountbatten, Lady Alexandra Etherington, Francesca Schwarzenbach and Rupert Elliott. Louise was the last child to wear the original royal christening gown.

Born with esotropia, Louise underwent an operation in 2006 in an unsuccessful attempt to correct the condition. She had further treatment in late 2013 that corrected her eyes.

==Education==
Louise attended St George&#x27;s School, Windsor Castle before moving to St Mary&#x27;s School Ascot in 2017 from Year 9. She chose English, history, politics and drama as her A-Level subjects. While attending school, she took part in The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award. Lady Louise started studying English at the University of St Andrews in September 2022. In August 2022, it was reported that she had been working at a garden centre over the summer. 

== Military training ==
In 2024, she joined the British Army&#x27;s University Officers&#x27; Training Corps (UOTC) unit, Tayforth UOTC, an Army Reserve unit which is made up of members studying at the University of St Andrews and other institutions in the surrounding region. As of 2025 she holds the rank of Officer Cadet in the Army Reserve.

==Official appearances==

In 2011, aged 7, Louise was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.

In August 2018, Louise accompanied her mother, patron of UK Sail Training, to Haslar Marina in Portsmouth Harbour to meet a group of young girls working towards earning their qualification on an entry-level course of the Royal Yachting Association. In the same month, mother and daughter attended the final of the Hockey Women&#x27;s World Cup in London. The Duchess is the patron of England Hockey. To celebrate Louise&#x27;s 15th birthday in November 2018, mother and daughter made a cameo appearance on &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; as they watched the popular BBC television show from the audience. Louise accompanied her mother in attending the International Horse Show at Olympia, London, in December 2018.

In September 2020, Louise participated in the Great British Beach Clean with her family at Southsea Beach, in support of the Marine Conservation Society.
Following the death of her grandfather, Prince Philip, Louise accompanied her parents to a church service at the Royal Chapel of All Saints on 11 April 2021. She also attended his funeral on 17 April 2021. In March 2022 Louise attended the memorial service for Prince Philip. She attended Trooping the Colour in June, where she also joined her family on the balcony; the Platinum Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving; and the Platinum Party at the Palace. Following the death of her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, on 8 September 2022, Louise stood vigil for 15 minutes at the Queen&#x27;s coffin at Westminster Hall together with her brother James and six cousins on 17 September. On 19 September, she joined other family members at the state funeral.

On 6 May 2023, Louise attended the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. On 7 May she attended the Coronation Concert at Windsor Castle.

==Personal interests==
Louise is a member of Girlguiding, of which her grandmother was patron and her mother is president. Her mother was a Brownie and a Guide when she was a child.

Louise was taught to ride at an early age, and joined her father on horseback as part of the Queen&#x27;s 90th birthday celebrations in Windsor in 2016. She has taken up carriage driving, a sport popularised in Britain by her grandfather, Prince Philip. In May 2017, she was responsible for leading the carriages of the Champagne Laurent-Perrier Meet of the British Driving Society at the Royal Windsor Horse Show. In May 2019, Louise took part in the Private Driving Singles carriage drive at the Royal Windsor Horse Show and achieved third place. She inherited her grandfather&#x27;s driving ponies and carriage in April 2021. In 2022, she drove one of his carriages in front of the Queen at the Royal Windsor Horse Show.

==Titles, styles, and honours==
===Titles and styles===
Louise is styled as &quot;Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor&quot;, although at the time of her birth the palace also used the style &quot;Lady Louise Windsor&quot; in some of its announcements. At birth, Louise automatically became a princess of the United Kingdom due to letters patent issued in 1917 which assigned princely status and the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; to all children of a monarch&#x27;s sons. However, when her parents married, Elizabeth II, via a Buckingham Palace press release, announced that their children would be styled as the children of an earl, rather than as prince or princess. In 2020, her mother stated that Louise retained her royal title and style and could make a choice on whether to use it from the age of 18.

===Honours===
In June 2008, to recognise a visit by Louise&#x27;s father to the Canadian province of Manitoba, a lake in the north of the province was named Lake Louise. Louise&#x27;s brother was similarly honoured by Lake James in the same province.

<text>The president of Hungary, officially the president of the republic ( , &quot;államelnök&quot;, or &quot;államfő&quot; ), is the head of state of Hungary. The office has a largely ceremonial (figurehead) role, but may also veto legislation or send legislation to the Constitutional Court for review. Most other executive powers, such as selecting government ministers and leading legislative initiatives, are vested in the office of the prime minister instead.

Former Head of the Constitutional Court, lawyer Tamás Sulyok, was elected as president on 26 February 2024, on the first day of the 2024 Spring Session in Parliament, succeeding Katalin Novák, who resigned on 10 February 2024 following a pardon scandal.

== Presidential election ==

The Constitution of Hungary provides that the National Assembly (&quot;Országgyűlés&quot;) elects the president of Hungary for a term of five years. Presidents have a term limit of two terms of office.

=== Independence of the function ===

According to Article 12 (2) of the Constitution, the president, when exercising their function, cannot exercise &quot;a public, political, economic or social function or mission&quot;. They may not engage in &quot;any other paid professional activity, and may not receive remuneration for any other activity, other than activities subject to copyright&quot;.

=== Condition for the candidature ===

According to Article 10 (2), any Hungarian citizen aged at least 35 years old may be elected as president.

=== Electoral process ===

Called by the president of the National Assembly, the presidential election must be held between 30 and 60 days before the end of the term of the incumbent president, or within 30 days if the office is vacated.

The Constitution states that candidatures must be &quot;proposed in writing by at least one fifth of the members of the National Assembly&quot;. They shall be submitted to the president of the National Assembly before the vote. A member of the National Assembly may nominate only one candidate.

The secret ballot must be completed within two consecutive days at the most. In the first round, if one of the candidates obtains more than 2/3 of the votes of all the members of the National Assembly, the candidate is elected.

If no candidate obtains the required majority, the second round is organized between the two candidates who obtained the most votes in the first round. The candidate obtaining the majority of the votes cast in the second round shall be elected president. If the second round is unsuccessful, a new election must be held after new candidatures are submitted.

=== Oath of office ===

According to Article 11 (6), the president of the republic must take an oath before the National Assembly.

The oath is as follows:


== Competencies and prerogatives ==

According to the Basic Law, &quot;the Head of State of Hungary is the President of the Republic who expresses the unity of the nation and oversees the democratic functioning of State institutions&quot;. The President is the Commander-in-Chief of the Hungarian Defence Forces, &quot;represents Hungary&quot;, &quot;may participate in the sittings of the National Assembly and take the floor&quot;, and can &quot;initiate laws&quot; or a national referendum. The President determines the date of elections, participates in &quot;decisions concerning particular states of law&quot; (state of war, emergency...), convokes the National Assembly after the elections, can dissolve it, and can check the conformity of a law by the Constitutional Court.

The head of state &quot;proposes the names of the Prime Minister, the President of the Curia, the Principal Public Prosecutor and the Commissioner of Fundamental Rights&quot;, is the sole nominator of judges and the President of the Budget Council. With the &quot;countersignature of a member of the government&quot;, the head of state appoints the ministers, the governor of the National Bank of Hungary, the heads of independent regulatory entities, university professors, generals, mandates ambassadors and university rectors, and &quot;awards decorations, rewards and titles&quot;. However, the president can refuse to make these appointments &quot;if the statutory conditions are not fulfilled or if it concludes for a well-founded reason that there would be a serious disturbance to the democratic functioning of the State institutions&quot;.

Also with the agreement of the government, the head of state &quot;exercises the right of individual pardon&quot;, &quot;decides matters of organization of territory&quot; and &quot;cases concerning the acquisition and deprivation of citizenship&quot;.

== Immunity and removal from office ==

According to Article 12 of the Basic Law, &quot;the President of the Republic is inviolable&quot;. Consequently, all criminal proceedings against the president can only take place after the end of their mandate.

However, Article 13 (2) of the Constitution provides for the removal of the president. This can only take place if the president &quot;intentionally violates the Basic Law or another law in the performance of duties, or if they commit an offense voluntarily&quot;. In such a case, the motion for removal should be proposed by at least of the members of the National Assembly.

The indictment procedure is initiated by a decision taken by secret ballot by a majority of of the members of the National Assembly. Subsequently, in proceedings before the Constitutional Court, it is determined whether the president should be relieved of their duties.

If the court establishes the responsibility of the president, the president shall be removed from office.

== Succession ==

=== Termination of mandate and incapacity ===

According to Article 12 (3), the term of office of the president of the republic ends:
* When the term of office is completed;
* By the death of the President while in office;
* By an incapacity which renders impossible the performance of their duties for more than 90 days;
* If they no longer meet the conditions for being eligible;
* A declaration of incompatibility of duties;
* By resignation;
* By dismissal.

According to Article 12 (4), the National Assembly must decide by a majority of 2/3 of all its members to decide the incapacity of the president of the republic to exercise their responsibilities for more than 90 days.

=== Absence (temporary incapacity) ===

According to Article 14 (1), if the president of the republic is temporarily incapable of exercising their functions and powers, these are exercised by the speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary, who can not delegate them to deputies and who is replaced in National Assembly duties by one of the deputy speakers of the National Assembly until the end of the president&#x27;s incapacity.

According to Article 14 (2), the temporary incapacity of the president of the republic is decided by the National Assembly on the proposal of the president themselves, the government, or a member of the National Assembly.

<text>This is a list of current heads of state and heads of government. In some cases, mainly in presidential systems, one leader is head of state and head of government. In other cases, mainly in semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of state and the head of government are different people. In semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of government (i.e. executive) role is fulfilled by the listed head of government and the head of state.

In one-party states, the ruling party&#x27;s leader (e.g. the General Secretary) is usually the &quot;de facto&quot; top leader of the state, though sometimes this leader also holds the presidency or premiership. In Andorra, Iran, and Vatican City (Holy See), a clergy member also acts as the head of state. In Andorra, this is the Bishop of Urgell, Co-Prince of Andorra; in Iran, this is the Supreme Leader; and in Vatican City, this is the Pope.

The list includes the names of recently elected or appointed heads of state and government who will take office on an appointed date, as presidents-elect and prime ministers–designate, and those leading a government-in-exile if internationally recognised.

<text>Fitzrovia () is a district of central London, England, in the West End. The eastern part of the area is in the London Borough of Camden, and the western in the City of Westminster. It has its roots in the Manor of Tottenham Court, and was urbanised in the 18th century. Its name was coined in the late 1930s by Tom Driberg.

It is characterised by its mixed-use of residential, business, retail, education and healthcare, with no single activity dominating. The once bohemian area was home to writers such as Virginia Woolf, George Bernard Shaw and Arthur Rimbaud. In 2016, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; named it the best place to live in London.

==Geography==

For a list of street name etymologies in Fitzrovia see: &quot;Street names of Fitzrovia&quot;.

Fitzrovia has never been an administrative unit, so has never had formal boundaries applied, but the somewhat grid-like pattern of local streets has lent itself to informal quadrangular definitions, with Euston Road to the north, Oxford Street to the south and Great Portland Street to the west. Some interpretations take Tottenham Court Road as the eastern boundary, but others prefer a wider interpretation, extending to the more easterly Gower Street. By these definitions, the area overlaps the long established and once formally defined districts of Marylebone in the City of Westminster (Western Fitzrovia overlaps almost completely with the officially designated East Marylebone Conservation Area within the modern borough of Westminster ), with the core area forming the south-west part of St Pancras in the London Borough of Camden. If the eastern boundary is taken to extend beyond Tottenham Court Road (i.e., to Gower Street) and to also extend south of Torrington Place, then the area also overlaps the historic boundaries of Bloomsbury (including St Giles with which it was long joined as a combined parish).

In 2014 Camden Council and Westminster City Council designated east and west areas as planning policy areas. Together these relate fairly closely to the wider interpretations, described above.

==Etymology==

Fitzrovia is named after either Fitzroy Square or the Fitzroy Tavern, a public house situated on the corner of Charlotte Street and Windmill Street (both the square and the tavern are in the east of the area). Until the end of the 19th century the area was an estate of the Dukes of Grafton, descended from Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, a son of Charles II and Barbara Villiers who bore the royal bastard surname FitzRoy, Norman-French for &quot;son of the king&quot;.)

The name Fitzrovia came into use in the late 1930s among an artistic, bohemian circle that were among the pub&#x27;s customers. The name was recorded in print for the first time by Tom Driberg MP in the &quot;William Hickey&quot; gossip column of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in 1940. The writer and dandy Julian MacLaren-Ross recalled in his &quot;Memoirs of the Forties&quot; that Meary James Thurairajah Tambimuttu aka &quot;Tambi&quot;, editor of &quot;Poetry London&quot;, had used the name Fitzrovia. Tambi had apparently claimed to have coined the name Fitzrovia, perhaps as a take on Belgravia. By the time Julian Maclaren-Ross met Tambimuttu and Dylan Thomas in the early 1940s this literary group had moved away from the Fitzroy Tavern, which had become a victim of its own success, and were hanging out in the lesser-known Wheatsheaf and others in Rathbone Place and Gresse Street. Maclaren-Ross recalls Tambimuttu saying: &quot;Now we go to the Black Horse, the Burglar&#x27;s Rest, the Marquess of Granby, The Wheatsheaf... in Fitzrovia.&quot; Maclaren-Ross replied: &quot;I know the Fitzroy&quot; to which Tambimuttu said: &quot;Ah, that was in the Thirties, now they go to other places. Wait and see.&quot; Tambimuttu then took him on a pub crawl. The name was largely forgotten as the avant-garde set moved out in the late-1940&#x27;s, but was revived in the 1970s, with the prevalence of use having waxed and waned since that time.

==History==
The core area of Fitzrovia has its roots in the ancient manor (estate) of Tottenham Court – first recorded as Þottanheale, from a charter from around AD 1000 (though the initial &#x27;Þ&#x27;, pronounced &#x27;th&#x27;, may have been a mistake by the scribe, all subsequent records using an initial &#x27;T&#x27;). The manor was subsequently described as &quot;Totehele&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, &quot;Totenhale&quot; in 1184 and &quot;Totenhale Court&quot; by 1487. Tottenham Court formed the south-western part of the parish and later borough of St Pancras.

The Fitzroy Tavern was named after Charles FitzRoy (later Baron Southampton), who purchased the Manor of Tottenham Court and built Fitzroy Square, to which he gave his name; nearby Fitzroy Street also bears his name. The square is the most distinguished of the original architectural features of the district, having been designed in part by Robert Adam. The south-western area was first developed by the Duke of Newcastle who established Oxford Market, now the area around Market Place. By the beginning of the 19th century, this part of London was heavily built upon, severing one of the main routes through it, Marylebone Passage, into the tiny remnant that remains today on Wells Street, opposite what would have been the Tiger public house — now a rubber clothing emporium.

In addition to Fitzroy Square and nearby Fitzroy Street, there are numerous locations named for the FitzRoy family and Devonshire/Portland family, both significant local landowners. Charles FitzRoy was the grandson of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, hence Grafton Way and Grafton Mews. William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland and his wife Margaret Harley lend their names to Portland Place, Great Portland Street and Harley Street. Margaret Harley was daughter of Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, for whom Oxford Street (the southern boundary of Fitzrovia) and Mortimer Street are named. The Marquessate of Titchfield is a subsidiary title to the Dukedom of Portland, hence Great Titchfield Street. William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland (Prime Minister) married Dorothy Cavendish, daughter of William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire (also Prime Minister), and they lend their names to New Cavendish Street, Cavendish Square and Devonshire Street. The name of the Grafton family&#x27;s country estate is Euston Hall, in Euston, Suffolk, and this is the origin of the name for Euston Station and Euston Road.

Two of London&#x27;s oldest surviving residential walkways can be found in Fitzrovia. Colville Place and the pre-Victorian Middleton Buildings (built 1759) are in the old London style of a way. When the parishes of St Pancras and Marylebone became boroughs in 1900, the decision was taken to make minor modifications to the ancient boundaries, whose pre-urban origin meant it cut awkwardly across the built environment in some places.
The western half of Charlotte Place the western part of part of Charlotte Street and the eastern half of Rathbone Street were transferred to Marylebone, despite these streets long history within St Pancras and their being more closely integrated with the urban grain of the St Pancras streets to the east.

The most prominent feature of the area is the BT Tower, Cleveland Street, which is one of London&#x27;s tallest buildings and was open to the public until an IRA bomb exploded in the revolving restaurant in 1971. Another notable modern building is the YMCA Indian Student Hostel on Fitzroy Square, one of the few surviving buildings by Ralph Tubbs.

===21st century===
The Middlesex Hospital, which closed in 2005 covered an extensive part of the area, and its redevelopment as Fitzroy Place was completed in 2016. 
The site of the hospital had initially been acquired by the property developer Candy and Candy which demolished the existing buildings to make way for a housing and retail development. The Candy brothers&#x27; scheme, which was unpopular with local people, failed during the 2008 credit crunch.

Stanhope plc took over the project and proposed a short-term project which would allow residents to create temporary allotments on the site until a new development was started. However, the Icelandic bank Kaupthing, which had a controlling interest in the site, announced in March 2010 its intention to sell the site on the open market and cancelled the allotments project. In July 2010, the site passed into the ownership of Aviva Investments and Exemplar Properties. A planning application for the new Middlesex Hospital project was submitted in August 2011 and it is understood that Exemplar would commence the redevelopment works in January 2012. The new Middlesex Hospital development was completed in 2014.

Separately, Derwent London plc acquired of property in the area to add to its existing Fitzrovia portfolio after a merger with London Merchant Securities. The company then held about of property over more than 30 sites in Fitzrovia. In November 2009 the company announced plans to transform part of Fitzrovia into a new retail destination with cafes and restaurants.

Derwent London created the Fitzrovia Partnership, a then-business partnership with Arup, Make Architects and City of London Corporation, with the support of the London Borough of Camden. In July 2010 Derwent London showcased plans for the redevelopment of the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi building in Charlotte Street. Plans produced by Make Architects proposed increasing the density of the site by 50 per cent and adding shops, cafes and a small open space.

Today, over 128,000 people work within 0.5 miles of Fitzrovia, according to the Fitzrovia Partnership&#x27;s 2014 Economic Report.

===Georgian workhouse===
Objection was raised by the local community over plans announced in July 2010 to demolish and redevelop the site of an 18th-century building in Cleveland Street, originally a poorhouse for the parish of St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, and later the Cleveland Street Workhouse.

==Arts==
Fitzrovia was a notable artistic and bohemian centre from roughly from the mid-1920s to the present day. Amongst those known to have lived locally and frequented public houses in the area such as the Fitzroy Tavern and the Wheatsheaf are Augustus John, Quentin Crisp, Dylan Thomas, Aleister Crowley, the racing tipster Prince Monolulu, Nina Hamnett and George Orwell. The Newman Arms on Rathbone Street, features in Orwell&#x27;s novels &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; (1936) and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949), as well as the Michael Powell film &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960).

Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Man&quot; (1791) was published during his residence at 154 New Cavendish Street, in reply to Edmund Burke (author of &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot;, 1790), who lived at 18 Charlotte Street. Artists Richard Wilson and John Constable lived at 76 Charlotte Street at various times. During the 19th century, painters Walter Sickert, Ford Madox Brown, Thomas Musgrave Joy and Whistler lived in Fitzroy Square. George Bernard Shaw and Virginia Woolf also resided at different times on the square, at number 29. The French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine lived for a time in Howland Street in a house on a site now occupied by offices. Modernist painter Wyndham Lewis lived on Percy Street. The house of Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester on Tottenham Street now shows a commemorative blue plaque. 97 Mortimer Street, where H. H. Munro (Saki) lived, now has a blue plaque commemorating his time there. Colin MacInnes author of &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; (1959) also resided on Tottenham Street, at number 28, with his publisher Martin Green and his wife Fiona Green.

X. Trapnel, the dissolute novelist (based on the real Julian MacLaren-Ross) in Anthony Powell&#x27;s &quot;Books Do Furnish a Room&quot; (1971), spends much of his time holding forth in Fitzrovia pubs. In Saul Bellow&#x27;s &quot;The Dean&#x27;s December&quot; (1982), the eponym, Corde dines at the Étoile, Charlotte Street, on his trips to London, and thinks he &quot;could live happily ever after on Charlotte Street&quot;; Ian McEwan quotes this in &quot;Saturday&quot; (2005). McEwan lived in Fitzroy Square, and his novel takes place in the area.

Chartist meetings were hosted in the area, some attended by Karl Marx, who is known to have been to venues at Charlotte Street, Tottenham Street and Rathbone Place. The area became a focus of Chartist activities after the Reform Act 1832 and was host to a number of working men&#x27;s clubs including The Communist Club at 49 Tottenham Street.

The UFO Club, home to Pink Floyd during their spell as the house band of psychedelic London, was held in the basement of 31 Tottenham Court Road. Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix also played at the Speakeasy on Margaret Street and Bob Dylan made his London debut at the King &amp; Queen pub on Foley Street. Oxford Street&#x27;s 100 Club is a major hot-bed for music from the 1960s to the present day, and has roots in 1970s Britain&#x27;s burgeoning Punk rock movement. The band Coldplay formed in Ramsay Hall, a University College London accommodation on Maple Street. Boy George lived in a squat in Carburton Street in 1981 prior to his success and Neil Howson of Age of Chance lived in Cleveland Street around the same time.

Fitzrovia is also the location of Pollock&#x27;s Toy Museum, home to erstwhile Toy Theatre, at 1 Scala Street.

At the back of Pollocks and in the next block was the site in 1772 of the Scala Theatre, Tottenham Street – then known as the Cognoscenti Theatre – but it had many names over history: the King&#x27;s Concert Rooms, the New Theatre, the Regency Theatre, the West London Theatre, the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, the Fitzroy Theatre, the Prince of Wales and the Royal Theatre until its demolition in 1903 when the Scala Theatre was built on the site for Frank Verity and modelled on La Scala in Milan. It was home to music hall, ballet and pantomime. Before its demolition in 1969, to make way for the office block and hotel that exists now, it was used inside for the filming in 1964 of the Beatles&#x27; film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, the Mr Universe World competitions, and Sotheby&#x27;s Auction in 1968 of the Diaghilev costumes and curtains. It was also briefly in the 1970s, in the basement of the office block, the site of the Scala Cinema and later still of Channel 4 Television. The branch of Bertorelli&#x27;s Italian Restaurant on Charlotte Street was prominently featured in the film &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;. Guy Ritchie more recently made &quot;RocknRolla&quot; using Charlotte Mews.

The Fitzrovia Chapel, in Pearson Square, is a Grade II* listed building which hosts exhibitions throughout the year. Stephen Friedman Gallery, Erskine, Hall and Coe and the photographer Richard Ansett have shown at the chapel. The chapel is also used for weddings and fashion shows.

===Books===
Books about Fitzrovia include: &quot;London&#x27;s Old Latin Quarter&quot;, by E. Beresford Chancellor, published by Jonathan Cape, 1930; &quot;Fitzrovia&quot;, by Nick Bailey, published by Historical Publications, 1981, ; and &quot;Characters of Fitzrovia&quot; by Mike Pentelow and Marsha Rowe, published by Chatto &amp; Windus (2001) and Pimlico (2002), .

===Film===
Parts of the film &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960) were shot in and around Newman Passage and Rathbone Street. Parts of &quot;Sapphire&quot; (1959) were filmed around Charlotte Street. Parts of &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; (2017) were filmed on Fitzroy Square and Grafton Mews.

===Music===
British singer-songwriter Donovan&#x27;s second album Fairytale features the evocative song Sunny Goodge Street about scoring hashish in the neighborhood. This is the first mention of hash in that era&#x27;s music. Donovan was the first of his ilk to be busted for it, by no coincidence he points out. The song is a Fitzrovia source for its mention of the Goodge Street platform, perhaps the dollhouses, the song&#x27;s then-new jazzy feel, and overall lyrics, that foreshadowed life in urban London.

==Business==

Initially, Fitzrovia was largely an area of well-to-do tradesmen and craft workshops, with Edwardian mansion blocks built by the Quakers to allow theatre employees to be close to work. Modern property uses are diverse, but Fitzrovia is still well known for its fashion industry, now mainly comprising wholesalers and HQs of the likes of Arcadia Group. New media outfits have replaced the photographic studios of the 1970s–90s, often housed in warehouses built to store the changing clothes of their original industry — fashion. Dewar Studios, leading fashion and modelling photographers based in Great Titchfield Street continue the traditional link to studios. Charlotte Street was for many years the home of the British advertising industry and is now known for its many and diverse restaurants. Today the district still houses several major advertising agencies including Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and TBWA as well as CHI &amp; Partners, Fallon, Dare Digital and Target Media Group. However, the modular ex-BT building occupied by McCann-Erickson was demolished in 2006 after the firm moved to an art deco home in nearby Bloomsbury.

A number of television production and post-production companies are based in the area, MTV Networks Europe, Nickelodeon, rogue and CNN Europe being headquartered here. ITN used to be based at 48 Wells Street during the 1980s, with its Factual Department still housed on Mortimer Street, and Channel 4 was, until 1994, situated on Charlotte Street, and talkbackTHAMES is currently based on Newman Street, with additional offices at 1 Stephen Street. Dennis Publishing is based close by, on Cleveland Street, and London&#x27;s &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine and City Guide is created and edited on Tottenham Court Road on the eastern border of Fitzrovia. Many other media companies are based within the area, including Informa, Arqiva and Digital UK.

Reflecting Fitzrovia&#x27;s connections with the avant-garde the area has a concentration of commercial art galleries and dealers.

Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, an international firm of architects, interior designers, landscape architects, urban planners and advanced strategists are based in the Qube on Whitfield Street, along with Make Architects. Derwent London also have a showroom in Whitfield Street. Derwent London own about of property in Fitzrovia: about one fifth of their total portfolio The Langham Estate have a similarly sized land holding in West Fitzrovia. A number of structural engineering consultants are based in offices on Newman Street and the world headquarters of Arup is on Fitzroy Street although they own many of the surrounding buildings (which are in the process of being redeveloped into modern offices). There were once many hospitals (including Middlesex Hospital, which closed in 2006, and St Luke&#x27;s Hospital for the Clergy, now re-opened after refurbishment). Several embassies (El Salvador, Mozambique, Turkmenistan and Croatia) are found amongst the many public houses. Retail use spills into parts of Fitzrovia from Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, which are two of the principal shopping streets in central London.

The Fitzrovia Partnership was formed in 2009 as &quot;a business-led initiative bringing together local businesses to add value and make a tangible difference to the management of Fitzrovia.&quot; Since August 2012, the Fitzrovia Partnership has been a formal Business Improvement District (BID). Activities have included installation of Christmas lighting in Tottenham Court Road, Charlotte Street and Fitzroy Street, an annual Christmas market, Feast at Fitzrovia summer festival, and a commitment to local job creation, support for small businesses and a focus on sustainability and improving air quality. In 2011, the BID came in for criticism, with damage to trees in Charlotte Street by Christmas lighting described by the &quot;Fitzrovia News&quot; as vandalism. The BID also operates a separate &quot;consumer&quot; facing brand – Enjoy Fitzrovia – to promote the area as a destination for shopping, eating, and art within London&#x27;s West End. In October 2014, The Fitzrovia Partnership teamed up with local resident Griff Rhys Jones to create the Dylan Thomas in Fitzrovia festival, a week of poetry, art and comedy across the area, celebrating the life and times of Dylan Thomas in the area.

==Education and research==
The University of Westminster has buildings on New Cavendish Street, Wells Street and Great Portland Street. University College London has buildings on Torrington Place, Huntley Street and New Cavendish Street. There are University of London halls of residences on Charlotte Street and Fitzroy Street. The Institute for Fiscal Studies is based at Ridgmount Street and the Royal Anthropological Institute Main office is at 50 Fitzroy Street.

All Souls&#x27; Church of England Primary School is at Foley Street. The building is Grade II listed. Southbank International School has two of its campuses located within the area, one on Portland Place and another on the northern end of Conway street (just off Warren Street). The Conway campus houses students from grade 11 and 12 where they study the IB Diploma Programme. Fashion Retail Academy is at Gresse Street.

==Social conditions==
Although often described as upmarket and home to some celebrities, like much of inner London, Fitzrovia residents have a wide disparity of wealth and the area contains a mix of affluent property owners as well as many private, council and housing association tenants. The neighbourhood is classified as above-averagely deprived, and parts of it have the worst living environment in the country according to a government report that ranked sub-wards by quality of housing, air quality and the number of road traffic accidents.

==Housing and community action==
The area lost much of its housing stock to other land uses during the 1960s, leading to the creation of resident&#x27;s groups seeking to preserve the residential character of the district.

The Charlotte Street Association was formed in 1970, and the Whitfield Study Group began issuing The Tower (later renamed Fitzrovia News) newspaper from 1973. At this time the Newspaper was distributed in an area between Euston Road and Oxford Street, Great Portland Street and Tottenham Court Road. The newspaper called the area &quot;Towerland&quot;, after the then new BT Tower.

The name Fitzrovia was revived when the first Fitzrovia Festival was held in 1973. The festival had the theme &quot;The people live here!&quot;. The organisers sought a name for the festival and an elderly resident named Eric Singer suggested using the name Fitzrovia, a name he remembered hearing in the 1940s, but which had fallen out of use. The purpose of the festival, still held on a regular basis, was to demonstrate that among the offices, restaurants and cafes there was a residential community that wanted its voice heard. The adoption of the name by the campaign groups, covering self-defined areas, meant the name Fitzrovia became applied to a fairly well defined area, one larger than that to which it was once loosely applied. The Newspaper continued to use the names &quot;Towerland&quot;, Fitzrovia and East Marylebone (for the area in the City of Westminster) in parallel.

The following year, the Fitzrovia Neighbourhood Association was formed and raised money to create a neighbourhood centre in a Grade II listed disused glass shop on the corner of Tottenham Street and Goodge Place. The Fitzrovia Neighbourhood Centre was opened in 1975.

The Fitzrovia Neighbourhood Centre continues to be a place of community action and a venue for voluntary groups to meet, and is the office of the &quot;Fitzrovia News&quot; which is produced four times a year by volunteers drawn from the residential community. An advice and information service and community projects, including the annual Fitzrovia Festival, are also delivered from the Neighbourhood Centre. The Fitzrovia News and Fitzrovia Festival are both supported by the Fitzrovia Neighbourhood Association.

The new Fitzrovia Community Centre is located at 2 Foley Street in the City of Westminster, just across from the Camden borough boundary. The Centre arose from a town planning (section 106) agreement between University College London Hospital (UCLH) and the London Borough of Camden. This agreement provided funding to provide the new community centre. The building has undergone a major refurbishment and designed to be a modern and welcoming multi-purpose building, with a range of rooms available for large and small groups and individuals.

Two new neighbourhood planning groups are currently in the process of formation. The Fitzrovia West and Fitzrovia East Neighbourhood Areas have been established by Westminster City Council and London Borough of Camden respectively.
In addition FitzWest, as it has become known has made further application to become a Neighbourhood Forum.

<text>Victoria Embankment is part of the Thames Embankment (the other section is the Chelsea Embankment), a road and river-walk along the north bank of the River Thames in London, England. Built in the 1860s, it runs from the Palace of Westminster to Blackfriars Bridge in the City of London, and acts as a major thoroughfare for road traffic between the City of Westminster and the City of London.

It is noted for several memorials, such as the Battle of Britain Monument, permanently berthed retired vessels, such as HMS &quot;President&quot;, and public gardens, including Victoria Embankment Gardens.

== History ==
===Earlier embankments===
The Victoria Embankment was preceded by many earlier works along the tidal Thames, including central London.
===Construction===

The Victoria Embankment was designed by civil engineer Francis Webb Sheilds, who submitted designs to a Royal Commission appointed in 1861. Following acceptance of the designs, construction was carried out by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the lines of his scheme. Construction, which started in 1865, was completed in 1870 under the direction of Joseph Bazalgette.

The Victoria Embankment was one element of a three-part work, the other two parts being the Albert Embankment, from the Lambeth end of Westminster Bridge to Vauxhall; and the Chelsea Embankment, extending from Millbank to the Cadogan Pier at Chelsea, close by Battersea Bridge. It was a project of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The contractor for the work was Thomas Brassey. The original impetus was the need to provide London with a modern sewerage system. Another major consideration was the relief of congestion on the Strand and Fleet Street.

The project involved building out on to the foreshore of the River Thames, narrowing the river. The construction work required the purchase and demolition of much expensive riverside property. The cut-and-cover tunnel for the District Railway was built within the Embankment and roofed over to take the roadway. The embankment was faced with granite, and penstocks, designed to open at ebb tide to release diluted sewage when rainstorms flooded the system, were built into it as a means of preventing backups in the drainage system and of periodically flushing the mud banks.

At ground level, in addition to the new roads, two public gardens were laid out. One of these backs onto the government buildings of Whitehall, and the other stretches from Hungerford Bridge to Waterloo Bridge. The gardens contain many statues, including a monument to Bazalgette. The section of the gardens between Waterloo Bridge and Charing Cross station also includes a large bandstand, where musical performances are given, and the 1626 watergate of the former York House built for the first Duke of Buckingham.

The Victoria section was the most complex of the three sections. It was much larger, more complex and more significant to the metropolis than the other two and officially opened on 13 July 1870 by the Prince of Wales and Princess Louise. When people refer to &quot;the Embankment&quot; they are usually referring to that portion of it. The total cost of the construction of the Victoria Embankment is estimated to be £1,260,000 and the purchase of property at £450,000. The total cost includes the cost of materials used in the construction of the embankment.

=== Issues in construction ===
Construction of the Victoria Embankment proved to be difficult because of the grandness of it. Parliament was assured that three years would be ample time to complete the project, which did not hold true.

In addition to not having a large enough labour force to complete the work on schedule, the project&#x27;s architect and property appraiser were challenged in successfully securing rights to all the wharves and other property that were required for access and storage during the project&#x27;s construction. They also ran into difficulty in acquiring contracts to maintain access to the steamboat landings at Westminster and Hungerford.

In addition, extra time and money were spent experimenting with a new type of cofferdam, a structure used to keep water out of the construction site, which was crucial for building along the tidal Thames.

=== Electrification ===

In December 1878 Victoria Embankment became the first street in Britain to be permanently lit by electricity. The light was provided by 20 Yablochkov candles powered by a Gramme DC generator. 16 March 1879 the system was extended to 40 lamps and 10 October to 55 lamps. Previously the street had been lit by gas, and in June 1884, gas lighting was re-established as electricity was not competitive.

==Route==

The Victoria Embankment (part of the A3211 road) starts at Westminster Bridge, just north of the Palace of Westminster, then follows the course of the north bank, past Hungerford Bridge and Waterloo Bridge, before ending at Blackfriars Bridge in the City. Shell Mex House, the Savoy Hotel and Savoy Place are located between the Embankment and the Strand.

== Transport ==
London Underground stations along Victoria Embankment are Embankment and Temple. London Buses route N550 is the only bus route along the Embankment, providing an overnight service when the tube is shut. Victoria Embankment was also the southern end of the Kingsway Tramway Subway. It was also used by trams as a loop right up until the end of the original tramway system in London in 1952.

London River Services boat services operate from Westminster Millennium Pier, Embankment Pier and Blackfriars Millennium Pier at points along Victoria Embankment. Pleasure cruises operate from Savoy Pier.

London&#x27;s east–west Cycleway 3, a kerb-protected cycle track across London, runs along most of the Victoria Embankment: it opened in 2016.

== Developing as the imperial city ==

The embankments were designed as a contribution to &quot;the appropriate, and appropriately civilized, cityscape for a prosperous commercial society.&quot; John Thwaites, the chair of the Metropolitan Board of Works, made note that the embankments were an important step in making London recognised as an exemplary imperial city, and that the embankments were the greatest public work to be taken in London. This imperial power was represented in the embankments&#x27; grandeur and could be seen in the way they controlled nature, linking the local experience of nature in London to the global rivalries of imperial powers. On the river side, new steamboat piers and landing stairs were designed for river access. Above ground were tree lined roadway and pedestrian walkways, surfaced with York paving stone and decorative gaslight posts for the top of the wall.

==Notable sites==

Ships permanently moored by Victoria Embankment include HMS &quot;President&quot;, HQS &quot;Wellington&quot;, and PS &quot;Tattershall Castle&quot;.

Other notable attractions include the General Charles Gordon Memorial, Royal Air Force Memorial, National Submarine War Memorial, Battle of Britain Monument, Cleopatra&#x27;s Needle and the modernistic Cleopatra&#x27;s Kiosk.

<doc id="380404" wikidata="Q922298" url="?curid=380404" title="Menai Strait">
<text>The Menai Strait () is a strait which separates the island of Anglesey from Gwynedd, on the mainland of Wales. It is situated between Caernarfon Bay in the south-west and Conwy Bay in the north-east, which are both inlets of the Irish Sea. The strait is about long and varies in width from between Fort Belan and Abermenai Point to between Puffin Island () and Penmaenmawr. It contains several islands, including Church Island (), on which is located St Tysilio&#x27;s Church.

The strait is bridged by the Menai Suspension Bridge (), which was completed in 1826 to a design by Thomas Telford and carries the A5 road, and the Britannia Bridge () a truss arch bridge which carries the North Wales Main Line and the A55 road; it is an adaptation of a tubular railway bridge completed in 1850 to a design by Robert Stephenson, which was severely damaged by a fire in 1970.

The differential tides at the two ends of the strait cause very strong currents which create dangerous conditions. One of the most hazardous areas is the Swellies (), between the two bridges, where rocks near the surface cause over-falls and local whirlpools. This was the site of the loss of the training ship HMS &quot;Conway&quot; in 1953. Entering the strait at the Caernarfon end is also hazardous because of the frequently shifting sand banks that make up Caernarfon bar.

==Origins==

The present day channel is a result of glacial erosion of the bedrock along a line of weakness associated with the Menai Strait fault system. During a series of Pleistocene glaciations a succession of ice-sheets moved from northeast to southwest across Anglesey and neighbouring Gwynedd scouring the underlying rock; the grain of which also runs in the same direction. The result was a series of linear bedrock hollows across the region, the deepest of which was flooded by the sea as world ocean levels rose at the end of the last ice age ( BC).

==History==
The name &quot;Menai&quot; comes from Welsh &quot;main-aw&quot; or &quot;main-wy&quot;, meaning &quot;narrow water.&quot;

According to &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, the 11th century Norse-Gael ruler Echmarcach mac Ragnaill plundered in Wales with his friend, the Viking Guttorm Gunnhildsson. However they started quarreling over the plunder and fought a battle at the Menai Strait. Guttorm won the battle by praying to Saint Olaf and Echmarcach was killed.

In the 12th century, a later Viking raid and battle in the Menai Strait are recounted in the Orkneyinga Saga as playing an important role in the life of Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney – the future Saint Magnus. He had a reputation for piety and gentleness. Refusing to fight in the raid on Anglesey, he stayed on board his ship, singing psalms. This incident is recounted at length in the 1973 novel &quot;Magnus&quot; by Orcadian author George Mackay Brown, and in the 1977 opera, &quot;The Martyrdom of St Magnus&quot; by Peter Maxwell Davies. The first of the opera&#x27;s nine parts is called &quot;The Battle of Menai Strait&quot;.

From the 1890s until 1963, the pleasure steamers of the Liverpool and North Wales Steamship Company would ply their main route from Liverpool and Llandudno along the Menai Strait, and around Anglesey. After the company&#x27;s voluntary liquidation in 1962, P and A Campbell took over the services for a while. Now, every year for two weeks in the summer, the MV &quot;Balmoral&quot; undertakes a similar service. The most recent service appears to have been Feb-2021, since when the vessel has been taken to dry dock for essential repair work

==Tidal effects==
The tidal effects observed along the banks of the strait can be confusing. A rising tide approaches from the south-west, causing the water in the strait to flow north-eastwards as the level rises. The tide also flows around Anglesey until, after a few hours, it starts to flow into the strait in a south-westerly direction from Beaumaris. By this time, the tidal flow from the Caernarfon end is weakening and the tide continues to rise in height but the direction of tidal flow is reversed. A similar sequence is seen in reverse on a falling tide. This means that slack water between the bridges tends to occur approximately one hour before high tide or low tide.

Theoretically it is possible to ford the strait in the Swellies at low water, spring tides when the depth may fall to less than . However, at these times a strong current of around is running, making the passage extremely difficult. Elsewhere in the strait the minimum depth is never less than until the great sand flats at Lavan Sands are reached beyond Bangor.

The tides carry large quantities of fish, and the construction of fish weirs on both banks and on several of the islands, helped make the Strait an important source of fish for many centuries. Eight of the numerous Menai Strait fish weirs are now scheduled monuments.

==Ecology==
===Marine===
Because the strait has such unusual tidal conditions, coupled with very low wave heights because of its sheltered position, it presents a unique and diverse benthic ecology.

The depth of the channel reaches in places, and the current can exceed . It is very rich in sponges.

The existence of this unique ecology was a major factor in the establishment of Bangor University&#x27;s School of Ocean Sciences at Menai Bridge, as well as its status as a &quot;special area of conservation with marine components&quot;. The waters are also a proposed Marine Nature Reserve.

===Land===
The same unique ecology and geomorphology has let to a number of designations of SSSIs along the strait including Glannau Porthaethwy, the ivy–oak–ash woodland on the southern shore (Coedydd Afon Menai) and Lavan Sands (Welsh: &quot;Traeth Lafan&quot;). The banks of the Menai Strait are home to the critically endangered Menai Whitebeam. The plant is an extremely rare species of Sorbus only found in this part of North Wales. The population contains about 30 plants, and most of these are thought to be mature.

Much of the land on Anglesey at the eastern end of the strait is designated as an area of outstanding natural beauty.

==Crossings==
===Menai Bridge===
Opened in 1826, the Menai Bridge is a 417 metre long, 30 metre tall suspension bridge, and the first bridge to cross the Menai Strait. The bridge, designed by Thomas Telford, carries the A5, a road which connects the capital London to Holyhead on Holy Island. The bridge itself is grade one listed and a candidate to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===Britannia Bridge===
Opened in 1850, the Britannia Bridge was built as a rail bridge connecting Anglesey to the mainland. The bridge, 461 metres long and 40 metres tall, carries the North Wales Coast Line connecting Holyhead to Crewe. Between 1970 and 1972, the bridge underwent a redesign in order to accommodate what would later become the A55, a dual carriageway connecting Chester to Holyhead. The bridge is grade two listed and is the more common crossing point out of the two bridges.

===Proposed third crossing===
Since 2007, a Third Menai Crossing had been proposed by government to tackle congestion on the other two crossings. However, on 14 February 2023, the Welsh Government announced that the project would not go ahead, citing efforts to reduce car usage, its environmental impact and it being a &quot;blot&quot; on the landscape. Issues with financing the project was later stated by the government as another reason why the project could not proceed. Lee Waters, deputy minister for climate change, later stated the crossing could be considered again as part of a wider review into the infrastructure of North Wales, rather than individually.

<text>Linear or point-projection perspective () is one of two types of graphical projection perspective in the graphic arts; the other is parallel projection. Linear perspective is an approximate representation, generally on a flat surface, of an image as it is seen by the eye. Perspective drawing is useful for representing a three-dimensional scene in a two-dimensional medium, like paper. It is based on the optical fact that for a person an object looks N times (linearly) smaller if it has been moved N times further from the eye than the original distance was.

The most characteristic features of linear perspective are that objects appear smaller as their distance from the observer increases, and that they are subject to , meaning that an object&#x27;s dimensions parallel to the line of sight appear shorter than its dimensions perpendicular to the line of sight. All objects will recede to points in the distance, usually along the horizon line, but also above and below the horizon line depending on the view used.


Italian Renaissance painters and architects including Filippo Brunelleschi, Leon Battista Alberti, Masaccio, Paolo Uccello, Piero della Francesca and Luca Pacioli studied linear perspective, wrote treatises on it, and incorporated it into their artworks.

==Overview==

Linear or point-projection perspective works by putting an imaginary flat plane that is close to an object under observation and directly facing an observer&#x27;s eyes (i.e., the observer is on a normal, or perpendicular line to the plane). Then draw straight lines from every point in the object to the observer. The area on the plane where those lines pass through the plane is a point-projection prospective image resembling what is seen by the observer.

=== Examples of one-point perspective ===


=== Examples of two-point perspective ===


=== Examples of three-point perspective ===
=== Examples of curvilinear perspective ===
Additionally, a central vanishing point can be used (just as with one-point perspective) to indicate frontal (foreshortened) depth.

==History==
===Early history===

The earliest art paintings and drawings typically sized many objects and characters hierarchically according to their spiritual or thematic importance, not their distance from the viewer, and did not use foreshortening. The most important figures are often shown as the highest in a composition, also from hieratic motives, leading to the so-called &quot;vertical perspective&quot;, common in the art of Ancient Egypt, where a group of &quot;nearer&quot; figures are shown below the larger figure or figures; simple overlapping was also employed to relate distance. Additionally, oblique foreshortening of round elements like shields and wheels is evident in Ancient Greek red-figure pottery.

Systematic attempts to evolve a system of perspective are usually considered to have begun around the fifth century BC in the art of ancient Greece, as part of a developing interest in illusionism allied to theatrical scenery. This was detailed within Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; as &quot;skenographia&quot;: using flat panels on a stage to give the illusion of depth. The philosophers Anaxagoras and Democritus worked out geometric theories of perspective for use with &quot;skenographia&quot;. Alcibiades had paintings in his house designed using &quot;skenographia&quot;, so this art was not confined merely to the stage. Euclid in his &quot;Optics&quot; () argues correctly that the perceived size of an object is not related to its distance from the eye by a simple proportion. In the first-century BC frescoes of the Villa of P. Fannius Synistor, multiple vanishing points are used in a systematic but not fully consistent manner.

Chinese artists made use of oblique projection from the first or second century until the 18th century. It is not certain how they came to use the technique; Dubery and Willats (1983) speculate that the Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome, while others credit it as an indigenous invention of Ancient China. Oblique projection is also seen in Japanese art, such as in the Ukiyo-e paintings of Torii Kiyonaga (1752–1815).

By the later periods of antiquity, artists, especially those in less popular traditions, were well aware that distant objects could be shown smaller than those close at hand for increased realism, but whether this convention was actually used in a work depended on many factors. Some of the paintings found in the ruins of Pompeii show a remarkable realism and perspective for their time. It has been claimed that comprehensive systems of perspective were evolved in antiquity, but most scholars do not accept this. Hardly any of the many works where such a system would have been used have survived. A passage in Philostratus suggests that classical artists and theorists thought in terms of &quot;circles&quot; at equal distance from the viewer, like a classical semi-circular theatre seen from the stage. The roof beams in rooms in the Vatican Virgil, from about 400 AD, are shown converging, more or less, on a common vanishing point, but this is not systematically related to the rest of the composition.

Medieval artists in Europe, like those in the Islamic world and China, were aware of the general principle of varying the relative size of elements according to distance, but even more than classical art were perfectly ready to override it for other reasons. Buildings were often shown obliquely according to a particular convention. The use and sophistication of attempts to convey distance increased steadily during the period, but without a basis in a systematic theory. Byzantine art was also aware of these principles, but also used the reverse perspective convention for the setting of principal figures. Ambrogio Lorenzetti painted a floor with convergent lines in his &quot;Presentation at the Temple&quot; (1342), though the rest of the painting lacks perspective elements.

===Renaissance===

It is generally accepted that Filippo Brunelleschi conducted a series of experiments between 1415 and 1420, which included making drawings of various Florentine buildings in correct perspective. According to Vasari and Antonio Manetti, in about 1420, Brunelleschi demonstrated his discovery of prospective by having people look through a hole on his painting from the backside. Through it, they would see a building such as the Florence Baptistery for which the painting was made. When Brunelleschi lifted a mirror between the building and the painting, the mirror reflected the painting to an observer looking through the hole, so that the observer can compare how similar the building and the painting of it are. (The vanishing point is centered from the perspective of an experiment participant.) Brunelleschi applied this new system of perspective to his paintings around 1425.

This scenario is indicative, but faces several problems that are still debated. First of all, nothing can be said for certain about the correctness of his perspective construction of the Baptistery of San Giovanni because Brunelleschi&#x27;s panel is lost. Second, no other perspective painting or drawing by Brunelleschi is known. (In fact, Brunelleschi was not known to have painted at all.) Third, in the account written by Antonio Manetti in his &quot;Vita di Ser Brunellesco&quot; at the end of the 15th century on Brunelleschi&#x27;s panel, there is not a single occurrence of the word &quot;experiment&quot;. Fourth, the conditions listed by Manetti are contradictory with each other. For example, the description of the eyepiece sets a visual field of 15°, much narrower than the visual field resulting from the urban landscape described.

Soon after Brunelleschi&#x27;s demonstrations, nearly every interested artist in Florence and in Italy used geometrical perspective in their paintings and sculpture, notably Donatello, Masaccio,Lorenzo Ghiberti, Masolino da Panicale, Paolo Uccello, and Filippo Lippi. Not only was perspective a way of showing depth, it was also a new method of creating a composition. Visual art could now depict a single, unified scene rather than a combination of several. Early examples include Masolino&#x27;s &quot;St. Peter Healing a Cripple and the Raising of Tabitha&quot; (), Donatello&#x27;s &quot;The Feast of Herod&quot; (), as well as Ghiberti&#x27;s &quot;Jacob and Esau&quot; and other panels from the east doors of the Florence Baptistery. Masaccio (d. 1428) achieved an illusionistic effect by placing the vanishing point at the viewer&#x27;s eye level in his &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; (), and in &quot;The Tribute Money&quot;, it is placed behind the face of Jesus. In the late 15th century, Melozzo da Forlì first applied the technique of foreshortening (in Rome, Loreto, Forlì and others).

This overall story is based on qualitative judgments, and would need to be faced against the material evaluations that have been conducted on Renaissance perspective paintings. Apart from the paintings of Piero della Francesca, which are a model of the genre, the majority of 15th century works show serious errors in their geometric construction. This is true of Masaccio&#x27;s &quot;Trinity&quot; fresco and of many works, including those by renowned artists like Leonardo da Vinci.

As shown by the quick proliferation of accurate perspective paintings in Florence, Brunelleschi likely understood (with help from his friend the mathematician Toscanelli), but did not publish the mathematics behind perspective. Decades later, his friend Leon Battista Alberti wrote &quot;&quot; (), a treatise on proper methods of showing distance in painting. Alberti&#x27;s primary breakthrough was not to show the mathematics in terms of conical projections, as it actually appears to the eye. Instead, he formulated the theory based on planar projections, or how the rays of light, passing from the viewer&#x27;s eye to the landscape, would strike the picture plane (the painting). He was then able to calculate the apparent height of a distant object using two similar triangles. The mathematics behind similar triangles is relatively simple, having been long ago formulated by Euclid. Alberti was also trained in the science of optics through the school of Padua and under the influence of Biagio Pelacani da Parma who studied Alhazen&#x27;s &quot;Book of Optics&quot;. This book, translated around 1200 into Latin, had laid the mathematical foundation for perspective in Europe.

Piero della Francesca elaborated on &quot;De pictura&quot; in his &quot;De Prospectiva pingendi&quot; in the 1470s, making many references to Euclid. Alberti had limited himself to figures on the ground plane and giving an overall basis for perspective. Della Francesca fleshed it out, explicitly covering solids in any area of the picture plane. Della Francesca also started the now common practice of using illustrated figures to explain the mathematical concepts, making his treatise easier to understand than Alberti&#x27;s. Della Francesca was also the first to accurately draw the Platonic solids as they would appear in perspective. Luca Pacioli&#x27;s 1509 &quot;Divina proportione&quot; (&quot;Divine Proportion&quot;), illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci, summarizes the use of perspective in painting, including much of Della Francesca&#x27;s treatise. Leonardo applied one-point perspective as well as shallow focus to some of his works.

Two-point perspective was demonstrated as early as 1525 by Albrecht Dürer, who studied perspective by reading Piero and Pacioli&#x27;s works, in his &quot;Unterweisung der Messung&quot; (&quot;Instruction of the Measurement&quot;).

==Limitations==


Perspective images are created with reference to a particular center of vision for the picture plane. In order for the resulting image to appear identical to the original scene, a viewer must view the image from the exact vantage point used in the calculations relative to the image. When viewed from a different point, this cancels out what would appear to be distortions in the image. For example, a sphere drawn in perspective will be stretched into an ellipse. These apparent distortions are more pronounced away from the center of the image as the angle between a projected ray (from the scene to the eye) becomes more acute relative to the picture plane. Artists may choose to &quot;correct&quot; perspective distortions, for example by drawing all spheres as perfect circles, or by drawing figures as if centered on the direction of view. In practice, unless the viewer observes the image from an extreme angle, like standing far to the side of a painting, the perspective normally looks more or less correct. This is referred to as &quot;Zeeman&#x27;s Paradox&quot;.

<text>Comparative psychology is the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. The phrase comparative psychology may be employed in either a narrow or a broad meaning. In its narrow meaning, it refers to the study of the
similarities and differences in the psychology and behavior of different species. In a broader meaning, comparative psychology includes comparisons between different biological and socio-cultural groups, such as species, sexes, developmental stages, ages, and ethnicities. Research in this area addresses many different issues, uses many different methods and explores the behavior of many different species, from insects to primates.

Comparative psychology is sometimes assumed to emphasize cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals. However, some researchers feel that direct comparisons should not be the sole focus of comparative psychology and that intense focus on a single organism to understand its behavior is just as desirable; if not more so. Donald Dewsbury reviewed the works of several psychologists and their definitions and concluded that the object of comparative psychology is to establish principles of generality focusing on both proximate and ultimate causation.

Using a comparative approach to behavior allows one to evaluate the target behavior from four different, complementary perspectives, developed by Niko Tinbergen. First, one may ask how pervasive the behavior is across species (i.e. how common is the behavior between animal species?). Second, one may ask how the behavior contributes to the lifetime reproductive success of the individuals demonstrating the behavior (i.e. does the behavior result in animals producing more offspring than animals not displaying the behavior)? Theories addressing the ultimate causes of behavior are based on the answers to these two questions.

Third, what mechanisms are involved in the behavior (i.e. what physiological, behavioral, and environmental components are necessary and sufficient for the generation of the behavior)? Fourth, a researcher may ask about the development of the behavior within an individual (i.e. what maturational, learning, social experiences must an individual undergo in order to demonstrate a behavior)? Theories addressing the proximate causes of behavior are based on answers to these two questions. For more details see Tinbergen&#x27;s four questions.

==History==
The 9th century scholar al-Jahiz wrote works on the social organization and communication methods of animals like ants. The 11th century Arabic writer Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) wrote the &quot;Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals&quot;, an early treatise dealing with the effects of music on animals. In the treatise, he demonstrates how a camel&#x27;s pace could be hastened or slowed with the use of music, and shows other examples of how music can affect animal behavior, experimenting with horses, birds and reptiles. Through to the 19th century, a majority of scholars in the Western world continued to believe that music was a distinctly human phenomenon, but experiments since then have vindicated Ibn al-Haytham&#x27;s view that music does indeed have an effect on animals.

Charles Darwin was central in the development of comparative psychology; it is thought that psychology should be spoken in terms of &quot;pre-&quot; and &quot;post-Darwin&quot; because his contributions were so influential. Darwin&#x27;s theory led to several hypotheses, one being that the factors that set humans apart, such as higher mental, moral and spiritual faculties, could be accounted for by evolutionary principles. In response to the vehement opposition to Darwinism was the &quot;anecdotal movement&quot; led by George Romanes who set out to demonstrate that animals possessed a &quot;rudimentary human mind&quot;. Romanes is most famous for two major flaws in his work: his focus on anecdotal observations and entrenched anthropomorphism.

Near the end of the 19th century, several scientists existed whose work was also very influential. Douglas Alexander Spalding was called the &quot;first experimental biologist&quot;, and worked mostly with birds; studying instinct, imprinting, and visual and auditory development. Jacques Loeb emphasized the importance of objectively studying behavior, Sir John Lubbock is credited with first using mazes and puzzle devices to study learning and Conwy Lloyd Morgan is thought to be &quot;the first ethologist in the sense in which we presently use the word&quot;.

Although the field initially attempted to include a variety of species, by the early 1950s it had focused primarily on the white lab rat and the pigeon, and the topic of study was restricted to learning, usually in mazes. This stunted state of affairs was pointed out by Beach (1950) and although it was generally agreed with, no real change took place. He repeated the charges a decade later, again with no results. In the meantime, in Europe, ethology was making strides in studying a multitude of species and a plethora of behaviors. There was friction between the two disciplines where there should have been cooperation, but comparative psychologists refused, for the most part, to broaden their horizons. This state of affairs ended with the triumph of ethology over comparative psychology, culminating in the Nobel Prize being given to ethologists, combined with a flood of informative books and television programs on ethological studies that came to be widely seen and read in the United States. At present, comparative psychology in the United States is moribund. 

Throughout the long history of comparative psychology, repeated attempts have been made to enforce a more disciplined approach, in which similar studies are carried out on animals of different species, and the results interpreted in terms of their different phylogenetic or ecological backgrounds. Behavioral ecology in the 1970s gave a more solid base of knowledge against which a true comparative psychology could develop. However, the broader use of the term &quot;comparative psychology&quot; is enshrined in the names of learned societies and academic journals, not to mention in the minds of psychologists of other specialisms, so the label of the field is never likely to disappear completely.

A persistent question with which comparative psychologists have been faced is the relative intelligence of different species of animal. Indeed, some early attempts at a genuinely comparative psychology involved evaluating how well animals of different species could learn different tasks. These attempts floundered; in retrospect it can be seen that they were not sufficiently sophisticated, either in their analysis of the demands of different tasks, or in their choice of species to compare. However, the definition of &quot;intelligence&quot; in comparative psychology is deeply affected by anthropomorphism; experiments focused on simple tasks, complex problems, reversal learning, learning sets, and delayed alternation were plagued with practical and theoretical problems. In the literature, &quot;intelligence&quot; is defined as whatever is closest to human performance and neglects behaviors that humans are usually incapable of (e.g. echolocation). Specifically, comparative researchers encounter problems associated with individual differences, differences in motivation, differences in reinforcement, differences in sensory function, differences in motor capacities, and species-typical preparedness (i.e. some species have evolved to acquire some behaviors quicker than other behaviors).

==Species studied==
A wide variety of species have been studied by comparative psychologists. However, a small number have dominated the scene. Ivan Pavlov&#x27;s early work used dogs; although they have been the subject of occasional studies, since then they have not figured prominently. Increasing interest in the study of abnormal animal behavior has led to a return to the study of most kinds of domestic animal. Thorndike began his studies with cats, but American comparative psychologists quickly shifted to the more economical rat, which remained the almost invariable subject for the first half of the 20th century and continues to be used.

Skinner introduced the use of pigeons, and they continue to be important in some fields. There has always been interest in studying various species of primate; important contributions to social and developmental psychology were made by Harry F. Harlow&#x27;s studies of maternal deprivation in rhesus monkeys. Cross-fostering studies have shown similarities between human infants and infant chimpanzees. Kellogg and Kellogg (1933) aimed to look at heredity and environmental effects of young primates. They found that a cross-fostered chimpanzee named Gua was better at recognizing human smells and clothing and that the Kelloggs&#x27; infant (Donald) recognised humans better by their faces. The study ended nine months after it had begun, after the infant began to imitate the noises of Gua.

Nonhuman primates have also been used to show the development of language in comparison with human development. For example, Gardner (1967) successfully taught the female chimpanzee Washoe 350 words in American Sign Language. Washoe subsequently passed on some of this teaching to her adopted offspring, Loulis. A criticism of Washoe&#x27;s acquisition of sign language focused on the extent to which she actually understood what she was signing. Her signs may have just been based on an association to get a reward, such as food or a toy. Other studies concluded that apes do not understand linguistic input, but may form an intended meaning of what is being communicated. All great apes have been reported to have the capacity of allospecific symbolic production.

Interest in primate studies has increased with the rise in studies of animal cognition. Other animals thought to be intelligent have also been increasingly studied. Examples include various species of corvid, parrots—especially the grey parrot—and dolphins. Alex (Avian Learning Experiment) is a well known case study (1976–2007) which was developed by Pepperberg, who found that the African gray parrot Alex did not only mimic vocalisations but understood the concepts of same and different between objects. The study of non-human mammals has also included the study of dogs. Due to their domestic nature and personalities, dogs have lived closely with humans, and parallels in communication and cognitive behaviours have therefore been recognised and further researched. Joly-Mascheroni and colleagues (2008) demonstrated that dogs may be able to catch human yawns and suggested a level of empathy in dogs, a point that is strongly debated. Pilley and Reid found that a Border Collie named Chaser was able to successfully identify and retrieve 1022 distinct objects/toys.

==Animal cognition==

Researchers who study animal cognition are interested in understanding the mental processes that control complex behavior, and much of their work parallels that of cognitive psychologists working with humans. For example, there is extensive research with animals on attention, categorization, concept formation, memory, spatial cognition, and time estimation. Much research in these and other areas is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings, such as navigation, tool use, and numerical competence. Thus, comparative psychology and animal cognition are heavily overlapping research categories.

==Disorders of animal behavior==

Veterinary surgeons recognize that the psychological state of a captive or domesticated animal must be taken into account if its behavior and health are to be understood and optimized.

Common causes of disordered behavior in captive or pet animals are lack of stimulation, inappropriate stimulation, or overstimulation. These conditions can lead to disorders, unpredictable and unwanted behavior, and sometimes even physical symptoms and diseases. For example, rats who are exposed to loud music for a long period will ultimately develop unwanted behaviors that have been compared with human psychosis, like biting their owners.

The way dogs behave when understimulated is widely believed to depend on the breed as well as on the individual animal&#x27;s character. For example, huskies have been known to ruin gardens and houses if they are not allowed enough activity. Dogs are also prone to psychological damage if they are subjected to violence. If they are treated very badly, they may become dangerous.

The systematic study of disordered animal behavior draws on research in comparative psychology, including the early work on conditioning and instrumental learning, but also on ethological studies of natural behavior. However, at least in the case of familiar domestic animals, it also draws on the accumulated experience of those who have worked closely with the animals.

==Human–animal relationships==
The relationship between humans and animals has long been of interest to anthropologists as one pathway to an understanding the evolution of human behavior. Similarities between the behavior of humans and animals have sometimes been used in an attempt to understand the evolutionary significance of particular behaviors. Differences in the treatment of animals have been said to reflect a society&#x27;s understanding of human nature and the place of humans and animals in the scheme of things. Domestication has been of particular interest. For example, it has been argued that, as animals became domesticated, humans treated them as property and began to see them as inferior or fundamentally different from humans.
Ingold remarks that in all societies children have to learn to differentiate and separate themselves from others. In this process, strangers may be seen as &quot;not people&quot;, and like animals. Ingold quoted Sigmund Freud: &quot;Children show no trace of arrogance which urges adult civilized men to draw a hard-and-fast line between their own nature and that of all other animals. Children have no scruples over allowing animals to rank as their full equals.&quot; With maturity however, humans find it hard to accept that they themselves are animals, so they categorize, separating humans from animals, and animals into wild animals and tame animals, and tame animals into house pets and livestock. Such divisions can be seen as similar to categories of humans: who is part of a human community and someone who is not—that is, the outsider.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; ran an article that showed the psychological benefits of animals, more specifically of children with their pets. It has been proven that having a pet does in fact improve kids&#x27; social skills. In the article, Dr. Sue Doescher, a psychologist involved in the study, stated, &quot;It made the children more cooperative and sharing.&quot; It was also shown that these kids were more confident with themselves and able to be more empathic with other children.

Furthermore, in an edition of &quot;Social Science and Medicine&quot; it was stated, &quot;A random survey of 339 residents from Perth, Western Australia were selected from three suburbs and interviewed by telephone. Pet ownership was found to be positively associated with some forms of social contact and interaction, and with perceptions of neighborhood friendliness. After adjustment for demographic variables, pet owners scored higher on social capital and civic engagement scales.&quot; Results like these let us know that owning a pet provides opportunities for neighborly interaction, among many other chances for socialization among people.

<text>The New Georgia Islands are part of the Western Province of Solomon Islands. They are located to the northwest of Guadalcanal. The larger islands are mountainous and covered in rain forest. The main islands are New Georgia, Vella Lavella, Kolombangara (a dormant volcano), Ghizo, Vangunu, Rendova and Tetepare. They are surrounded by coral reefs and include the Marovo Lagoon.

Another famous location is Kennedy Island where the future United States president, John F. Kennedy, spent three days stranded during World War II. Several of the islands were scenes of fighting in the war.

The main towns are Gizo, Munda and Noro.
The main industries are forestry and fishing.

One of the smaller New Georgia islands, Ranongga, was lifted three metres (10 ft.) out of the Pacific Ocean by the 2007 Solomon Islands earthquake, causing an expansion of its shoreline by up to 70 metres all around.

Northwest Solomonic languages are spoken on the island, as well as the non-Austronesian language Touo in the southern part of Rendova Island.

<doc id="380409" wikidata="Q6537170" url="?curid=380409" title="Lewis White Beck">
<text>Lewis White Beck (September 26, 1913 – June 7, 1997) was an American philosopher and scholar of German philosophy specializing in German idealism. Beck was Burbank Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy at the University of Rochester and served as the Philosophy Department chair there from 1949 to 1966. He translated several of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s works, such as the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot;, and was the author of &quot;Studies in the Philosophy of Kant&quot; (1965).

==Biography==
Born in Griffin, Georgia, Beck was the youngest of four children in a family raised by Erasmus W. Beck and Ann H. Beck. His siblings included: Evelyn H. Beck , Edwin H. Beck and Sarah A Beck. His father was employed as both an engineer and a sales representative.

Beck received his bachelor&#x27;s degree Phi Beta Kappa from Emory University in 1934, his master&#x27;s degree from Duke University in 1935, and his doctoral degree from Duke University in 1937. His dissertation was entitled: &quot;Synopsis: A Study in the Theory of Knowledge.

===Academic career===

Before moving to Rochester, Beck was an international student and a Rosenwald Fund Fellow at the University of Berlin (1937–38; an interview about his experiences there appeared in &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;, September 18, 1938), an instructor at Emory University (1938–41), Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Delaware (1941–48), and associate professor at Lehigh University (1946–48), eventually becoming professor (1948–49).

Beck joined the faculty at the University or Rochester in 1949 and served as Chairman of its Department of Philosophy from 1949 to 1966. He also served as Associate Dean of the Graduate School (1952-1956) as well as the Dean of the Graduate School (1956–1957) where he helped to raise international recognition for the PhD. program in Philosophy. During this time he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in the field of Philosophy (1957). In 1970 he collaborated with the Kantian scholar Gottfried Martin at the University of Bonn to organize the first International Kant Congress to be hosted in the United States and helped to established an enduring close collaboration between Kantian scholars in both Germany and America.

In 1962 he was appointed as the Burbank Professor of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy and subsequently Professor Emeritus in 1979. In 1962 he became the first recipient of the University&#x27;s Edward Peck Curtis Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching. He was subsequently elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963 and the American Council of Learned Societies in 1964. From 1970 to 1975, Beck also served on the National Endowment for the Humanities Council. During this time he also served as a member of the board of directors for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1970–1978).

During the course of his long academic career, Beck also held appointments as a visiting lecturer at several leading academic research centers including: Columbia University (1950), George Washington University, the University of Minnesota (1953), the University of California at Berkeley (1973), Yale University (1974) and the Rochester Institute of Technology (1982–1983). In addition, he received honorary degrees from Hamilton College, Emory University and the University of Tubingen.

In addition to his teaching activities, Beck also served on the editorial board of several leading philosophical research journals including: the &quot;Journal of the History of Ideas&quot; and &quot;Kantian-Studien&quot;. Over the years he also served on the editorial board of the journal &quot;The Monist&quot; which also featured his work. In addition, in 1970 he served as editor of the &quot;Proceedings of the Third International Kant Congress&quot;. In 1985 he also contributed to the formation of the North American Kantian Society.

Over the years, Beck was praised by his students for his charm and wit. Even after his formal retirement in 1979 he continued to meet with informal gatherings of aspiring young scholars in an effort to share his unique insights into Kant&#x27;s works until 1996. He was often observed to joke that his prize for an award in teaching excellence was rejected as &quot;nontaxable&quot; by the Internal Revenue Service because it was more appropriately categorized as &quot;unearned&quot;.

===Academic works===
====Immanuel Kant====
Beck is most noted for his research into the collective writings of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Included among his publications is a translation of Kant&#x27;s extensive &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; in 1949. He also achieved widespread national and international recognition within academic circles for his scholarship, commentary and encyclopedic knowledge of Kant&#x27;s philosophical works. In addition, he has been cited in &quot;Kant-Studien&quot; as one of the first scholars in the Anglo-Saxon tradition to compile a comprehensive review of early German philosophy before Kant and clarifying Kant&#x27;s work within such a historical context. 

In the course of his exhaustive commentaries, Beck shared several noteworthy insights into Kant&#x27;s philosophical thoughts. While revisiting Kant&#x27;s distinction between &quot;analytic&quot; and &quot;synthetic&quot; truths and his concept of the &quot;synthetic a priori&quot;, Beck attempted to clarify Kant&#x27;s reasoning by exploring whether synthetic judgements should be made analytic, as well as whether Kant incorrectly identified some &quot;contingent judgements&quot; as &quot;necessary judgements&quot;. He further observed that Kant&#x27;s utilization of the term &quot;synthetic&quot; appears to convey different meanings in Kant&#x27;s writings on transcendental logic as compared to his writings on the theory of general logic. Beck observed further that this divergence in meaning accounts for the unfortunate confusion in the minds of many students who explore translations of Kant&#x27;s works from the original German into English.

Beck also asserted that Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; has been largely neglected by modern readers and sometimes supplanted in the minds of many scholars by the &quot;Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals.&quot; He claimed that a complete understanding of Kant&#x27;s moral philosophy is most easily attained by reviewing Kant&#x27;s &quot;second critique&quot; which puts forth an analysis of the concepts of both freedom and practical reason. In his &quot;A Commentary on Kant&#x27;s Critique of Practical Reason&quot; (1961) Beck asserts that Kant&#x27;s &quot;second critique&quot; serves to weave these divers strands into a unified pattern for his theory on moral authority in general.

====Secular philosophy====
In his &quot;Six Secular Philosophers&quot; (1966, Rev. 1997), Beck also endeavored to explore the general characteristics of a secular philosophy and whether such a philosophy can be formulated to accommodate religious beliefs and values. Beck observed that while an exact or precise conceptualization of a secular philosophy might be elusive, a secular philosophy is likely to require an appeal to an independence of thought. In Beck&#x27;s view it should also incorporate certain aspects of religious thought as well. With this in mind, Beck identified several &quot;families&quot; of secular philosophers. In his first group Beck calls our attention to philosophers who placed limits on the scope, validity and content of religious belief by an appeal to scientific and philosophic endeavors. He identifies Baruch Spinoza, David Hume and Kant in this grouping. In his second grouping, Beck identified Frederich Nietzsche, William James and George Santayana, each of whom explored the relationship of religious values in general to other values in life. Beck asserted that Kant ultimately could not embrace Spinoza&#x27;s embrace of substance or his appeal to monism. According to Beck, Kant agreed instead with Hume that a scientific interpretation of nature cannot serve by itself to confirm religious belief. According to Beck, Kant also parted ways with Hume, however, by insisting that a different rational basis for religious thought can be found in mankind&#x27;s moral consciousness.

====Additional interests====
Beck&#x27;s scholarly publications also reflect his interest in philosophical topics which are not prima facia directly related to the works of Immanuel Kant. In 1966 he published a detailed philosophical examination of the characteristics of mankind&#x27;s conscious and unconscious motives entitled &quot;Conscious and Unconscious Motives.&quot; In 1968, he also collaborated with his colleague Robert L. Holmes at the University of Rochester in the book &quot;Philosophic Inquiry: An Introduction to Philosophy&quot;. Years later in 1971, he also presented his insights into the topic of searching for extraterrestrial life for the sixty-eighth annual Eastern Meeting of the American Philosophical Association in New York City in a paper which he entitled &quot;Extraterrestrial Intelligent Life.&quot;

In the later work, Beck traces the evolution of philosophical speculation concerning the presence of intelligent extraterrestrial life forms starting with the ancient writings of Lucretius, Plutarch and Aristotle, to the contributions made by Copernicus and culminating in the modern age within the works Darwin, Immanuel Kant, William Whewell and Marx. He argues that our ancestors in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were plagued by a profound pessimism over the decline of the natural world due to mankind&#x27;s sinfulness and consequently sought redemption by searching for the presence of &quot;higher beings&quot; within the universe. Similarly, in modern times, mankind&#x27;s despair and technological shock is due in part to his pollution of the natural world and in part due to repeated failures of moral belief. He argues further that deeply seated religious, philosophical and existential beliefs are serving to perpetuate the comforting archetypal idea that mankind is not alone in the universe. Beck concludes on an optimistic note, however, by suggesting that while the quest for other or superior forms of life in the universe may not prove successful, it may yield beneficial consequences by assisting mankind in the actualization of better ways of life here on Earth.

Beck was also intrigued by the concept of &quot;man as a creator&quot;. His analysis of the history of philosophy within the Western tradition, traces the dynamic interaction of Kant&#x27;s idea of the &quot;land of truth&quot;, in which man&#x27;s creativity evolves within the context of his search for knowledge, with the creative idea of an &quot;unknowable beyond&quot;, which was first cultivated by philosophers of the ancient world. In Beck&#x27;s view, the Platonic idea of a creative yet hidden ultimate reality now functions as a more dominate paradigm in the form of a &quot;nervus probandi&quot; within our modern systems of thought and ethical values. He notes that three responses to such a paradigm shift have emerged. In the first, philosophers deny the existence of such a transcendent &quot;unknowable beyond&quot; by asserting that it is merely the product of human imagination which can be easily dismissed. As examples, Beck cites the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and various positivistic scholars. The second possible response has been adopted by scholars who accept that such a hidden reality exists and that it can be known through either philosophical reasoning, mystical insight or a combination of both. As examples, Beck points to the works of both Plato and Georg Hegel. Lastly, Beck observes yet a third response incorporates the assertion that such an &quot;unknowable beyond&quot; may exist but that mankind is &quot;indefeasibly&quot; ignorant of it. Beck argues that Thomas Acquinas, Blaise Pascal, Søren Kierkegaard, William James and Immanuel Kant all adopt variations on this theme In this view, man is a creator of order only within narrow limits and cannot acquire definitive knowledge of the &quot;unknowable beyond.&quot; Nevertheless, such a realm is clearly of paramount existential importance. Therefore, instead of professing &quot;knowledge&quot; of its existence, mankind is advised to knowingly acknowledge his ignorance and affirm its existence purely as an act of faith. Beck himself seems partial to this view when he gently reminds his readers that:
: &quot;It is not my place to tell you whether there is indefeasible ignorance of ultimate reality. I am ignorant of whether there is or is not. But you should think of these things because there are no things more important, though there are no questions more difficult or less answerable. But one&#x27;s whole life may be changed if one changes his mind about these questions.&quot;

===Honours===
In addition to receiving fellowships from the Rosenwald Fund in 1937, the Guggenheim Foundation in 1957, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963, and the American Council of Learned Societies in 1964, Beck was the first recipient of the University Of Rochester&#x27;s Edward Peck Curtis Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 1962.

In addition, Beck was the recipient of several honorary degrees from several leading scholarly institutions including:Hamilton College, Emory University and the university of Tubingen. He was also an honorary member of the &quot;Kant Society&quot; in Germany.

In 2001 Beck was honored by several prominent scholars and the philosopher Predrag Cicovaki with the publication of &quot;Kant&#x27;s Legacy: Essays in Honor of Lewis White Beck&quot;. The leading scholar of German philosophy Walter Kaufmann also paid special tribute to Beck&#x27;s scholarship in his work &quot;Goethe, Kant and Hegel&quot; in 1980.

===Death===
Beck retired in 1979 and died in 1997 at age 83 in Rochester, New York. He was survived by his wife
Caroline as well as his two sons Brandon and Hamilton along with two grandsons.

<doc id="380410" wikidata="Q2007571" url="?curid=380410" title="DVONN">
<text>DVONN is a two-player strategy board game in which the objective is to accumulate pieces in stacks. It was released in 2001 by Kris Burm as the fourth game in the &quot;GIPF&quot; Project. &quot;DVONN&quot; won the 2002 International Gamers Award and the &quot;Games&quot; magazine Game of the Year Award in 2003.

== Rules ==
=== Equipment ===

&quot;DVONN&quot; is played on a board with 49 spaces. The board has a hexagonal layout 5 hexes wide. Equivalently, the board can be considered to be a hexagonal shape with three intersecting nodes on four sides, and nine nodes on two longer sides opposite each other. These nodes are connected by a triangular grid, similar to other games in the &quot;GIPF&quot; Project.

The set includes 49 colored pieces. One player has 23 black pieces to play, while the other player has 23 white pieces. There are also 3 neutral red pieces, called &quot;DVONN pieces&quot;.

=== Object ===
The object of the game is to control more pieces than your opponent at the end of the game.

=== Game phases ===
The game starts with an empty board and proceeds in two phases: first the players take turns filling the board in the &quot;placement phase&quot;, then players build stacks of pieces during the &quot;movement phase&quot;. To start, players determine which one moves first; that player is assigned two of the red &quot;DVONN pieces&quot; and the twenty-three white pieces. The other player is assigned one &quot;DVONN piece&quot; and the twenty-three black pieces.

==== Placement ====
During the first phase, the players place their pieces on the board, starting with the three red &quot;DVONN&quot; pieces. Pieces can be placed on any unoccupied space. White starts, and the players alternate. So Black is the first to place a piece of their own color. The first phase ends when all pieces are placed on the board, filling it completely.

==== Movement ====

Players build stacks of pieces during the second phase by moving pieces and stacks onto other pieces or stacks.

Relevant definitions:
# Stack &quot;mobility&quot; is determined by the number of surrounding stacks. If a stack is surrounded by 6 adjacent stacks, it is &quot;immobile&quot; and cannot be moved.
# A stack is &quot;owned&quot; by a player if their color is on top.
# The &quot;height&quot; of a stack &quot;h&quot; is equal to the number of pieces in the stack. In this phase, &quot;stacks&quot; and &quot;pieces&quot; are used interchangeably, with the understanding that a piece is simply a stack with one member or height &quot;h&quot; = 1.

During the movement phase:
# The white player takes the first move in the movement phase. Because the board is completely filled, the white player must move a white piece on the perimeter of the board as the first move.
# The height &quot;h&quot; of a stack determines the number of spaces that stack will move. In the illustrated example, the only legal move for the black-owned stack of two at D3 is two spaces to the right to F3, denoted The white-owned stack of nine pieces at I5 is effectively immobile, as there are no legal moves.
# All moves must follow a straight line; most interior spaces have six potential directions for movement, while the perimeter spaces have four directions, and the corner spaces have three. The triangular-gridded board illustrates this clearly.
# Stacks cannot be moved onto an empty space. All moves must terminate on an occupied space. However, stacks may jump over empty or occupied spaces.
# Single &quot;DVONN pieces&quot; cannot be moved, but they can be moved once they are part of a stack. For example, the black-owned stack at C2 could be moved on top of the &quot;DVONN piece&quot; at F2: 
# After each move, all stacks that are not connected via adjoining stacks to a &quot;DVONN pieces&quot; (or stacks with a &quot;DVONN piece&quot;) are removed from the board. For instance, if the white piece at F1 is moved to the &quot;DVONN piece&quot; at F2 , that disconnects the black piece at G1, and it would be removed from the board. Similarly, the move would disconnect the white stack of two at K4 and remove it from the board, which would not be advantageous for the white player.

=== Passing and game end ===
A player is not allowed to pass unless no legal moves are available. The game ends when both players have no legal moves. To determine the winner, each player collects their owned stacks into a single tower. The winner is the player with the higher tower. The game ends in a draw in case both players own an equal number of stones in their tower.

The maximum possible number of moves in the game is 97 (49 for placement and 48 in play, passes are not counted).
In competition, each player typically gets 15 minutes for the entire game in real-life tournaments, or 10 minutes for online tournaments.

== Strategy ==

The rules of &quot;DVONN&quot; can be learned in a few minutes. The main factor needed to win is to be in control of the game. The basic strategy of the game is given on the &quot;GIPF&quot; Project website. The more advanced strategy tips are derived from the general strategy guidelines developed by the &quot;DVONN&quot; guild at the BrettspielWelt game site. In 2003, 2004, and 2008 the game developer, Kris Burm, organized a real life &quot;DVONN&quot; world championship.

=== Placement phase ===
Many beginner players place their pieces at the start of the game without a clear objective. However, placement is as major a factor in winning as the movement phase. While it is not possible to guarantee victory with a strong setup, it is possible to have no chance of winning by placing your stones badly.

Pieces should be placed with three main goals in mind: spaces by &quot;DVONN&quot; pieces, spaces by the side, and general density. The first objective is to place pieces by &quot;DVONN&quot; pieces, thereby keeping them safe from potential separation. Keeping at least three pieces by each &quot;DVONN&quot; piece helps defend them from potential attack. Next, pieces that are surrounded cannot move; therefore, having pieces along the side to start the game is valuable. Such pieces should also be in position to free other pieces on the inside. Finally, lumping groups of one&#x27;s own pieces together is usually poor strategy. It is desirable to capture on every move, or at least take a &quot;DVONN&quot; piece; keeping all of one&#x27;s pieces together often makes this difficult. Spreading pieces out across the board also increases the chance of maintaining a short (and therefore highly mobile) stack into endgame, where it may be moved into position for a crucial capture.

It may also be possible to string a line of one&#x27;s own pieces across the board up and down. Play almost always separates along this line; pieces on one side of a string that has no &quot;DVONN&quot; piece are usually doomed. An additional advantage of placing stones connected in a line is that moving a stone on either end of the line will free another own stone for movement.

Having an even distribution of the &quot;DVONN&quot; pieces over the board is usually recommended for novice players, since this way they will be less vulnerable against groups of stones being lost by a cut off. Having all 3 red &quot;Dvonn&quot; pieces grouped together near the edge almost guarantees a win for an experienced player playing with white.

=== Movement phase ===
The first few moves should correct any place where your position must be fixed: helping or moving pieces that could become isolated and moving outside pieces in order to give inside ones mobility. To go for a victory, one should try to recognize if it is possible to isolate part of the board from all the red &quot;DVONN&quot; pieces in such a way that the isolated part will contain more of the opponents stones than your own. Preferably, always play stones towards the &quot;DVONN&quot; pieces rather than away from them.

Capturing pieces that could capture a &quot;DVONN&quot; piece can be important, as a moving &quot;DVONN&quot; piece controlled by the opponent can isolate a large group of pieces. However, mobility is the most important aspect of &quot;DVONN&quot;; one needs to keep one&#x27;s options open. Building a tall stack early in the movement phase is a mistake. Most often, the game is won by the player who is capable of making the last move(s). Maintaining some single stones until the end phase is, therefore, very often a good strategy. As a general rule one can state that using a tower to take a single stone of the opponent usually is one of the better moves, since this preserves own singles. A second general rule for selecting which move to make is that you should not make a move that the opponent cannot prevent you from making at a later time.

A very common mistake among beginners is that they are stacking own stones on top of each other in an attempt to prevent losing stones by being cut off by the opponent. However, since the game is all about mobility, this usually is a bad thing, since by stacking two of their own stones, instead of capturing an opponent&#x27;s stone, they are effectively losing one stone. Only when a really large group of own stones is at risk, or in the end-phase of the game, should one consider placing own stones on top of each other. In any other situation, it is better to just give up the stone(s) in risk of being isolated and play offensive moves elsewhere and make the opponent lose a similar or preferably larger number of stones on another part of the board.

Taking a &quot;DVONN&quot; piece is especially desirable if it is possible to move it toward one&#x27;s own pieces and away from one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s. However, every capture counts, so big captures and maintaining mobility is more important than just taking &quot;DVONN&quot; pieces. A similar rule applies here as is the case for placing own stones on top of each other. When a &quot;DVONN&quot; piece is taken, the opponent is not losing a stone, which means that effectively you are set back one stone in the stonecount compared to the opponent. Therefore, one should take a &quot;DVONN&quot; piece only if one has a plan with it to gain a larger advantage, or if one needs to prevent the opponent from gaining a significant advantage by moving it.

After move 70 (about 20 moves into the movement phase) the board clears and settles. It becomes much more important to look ahead to see how every move affects the overall situation. Tall stacks are very hard to move, so they should be formed next to (or on) &quot;DVONN&quot; pieces and out of line of potential captures.

=== Strategy terminology ===
&quot;DVONN&quot; strategy discussions among expert players often use a number of terms to express the game situation. In the Yahoo Gipf discussion group the development of this list of terms was initiated by Alan Kwan and completed by Kris Burm.
== Dvonn playing computer programs ==
There are many computer programs capable of playing Dvonn at a high level. Some of the early ones include:
* dDvonn
* Dvonner
* RoRoRo the Bot
* Jan&#x27;s Dvonn program
RoRoRo the Bot and Jan&#x27;s program used to play online at the LittleGolem games site until 2014 and 2016 respectively, and were usually among the top 10 players.

Holtz is a program supporting multiple games, including Dvonn.

Dvonn was the topic of the 2011 CodeCup which produced many high-level computer players, including contest winner PrimaDvonna.

<doc id="380419" wikidata="Q661818" url="?curid=380419" title="Harad">
<text>In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s high fantasy &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Harad is the immense land south of Gondor and Mordor. Its main port is Umbar, the base of the Corsairs of Umbar whose ships serve as the Dark Lord Sauron&#x27;s fleet. Its people are the dark-skinned Haradrim or Southrons; their warriors wear scarlet and gold, and are armed with swords and round shields; some ride gigantic elephants called &quot;mûmakil&quot;.

Tolkien based the Haradrim on ancient Aethiopians, people of Sub-Saharan Africa, following his philological research on the Old English word &quot;Sigelwara&quot;. He deduced that this word referred to some kind of soot-black fire demon before it was applied to the Aethiopians. He based the Haradrim&#x27;s use of war elephants, meanwhile, on that of Pyrrhus of Epirus in his war against Ancient Rome. Critics have debated whether Tolkien was racist in making the protagonists white and the antagonists black, but others have noted that Tolkien showed anti-xenophobic sentiments in real life, opposing any attempt to demonise the enemy in both World Wars.

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s film &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, the Haradrim were based on 12th century Saracens: they have turbans and flowing robes, and they ride &quot;mûmakil&quot;. The Haradrim appear in a variety of games and merchandise inspired by &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

==Middle-earth narrative==

=== Geography ===

Harad is a large land in the south of Middle-earth, bordered to the north by (from west to east) the lands of Gondor, Mordor, Khand and Rhûn. Historically the border with Gondor was to be the river Harnen, but by the time of the War of the Ring all the land further north to the river Poros is under the influence of the Haradrim. The border with Mordor runs along the southern Mountains of Shadow. Harad&#x27;s west coast (the nearest to Gondor) is washed by the Great Sea, the western ocean of Middle-earth. Harad&#x27;s eastern shores looks out on the Eastern Sea, Middle-earth&#x27;s eastern ocean.

The elves named the land and its people &quot;Haradwaith&quot;, &quot;South-folk&quot;, from the Sindarin &quot;harad&quot;, meaning &quot;south&quot;, and &quot;gwaith&quot;, meaning &quot;people&quot;. The Quenya word &quot;Hyarmen&quot; similarly means &quot;south&quot; in addition to being the name of the country. The hobbits called the area the &quot;Sunlands&quot;, and the people &quot;ings&quot;. Aragorn briefly describes his journeys in the land as being in &quot;Harad where the stars are strange&quot;. Tolkien confirmed that this meant that Aragorn had travelled &quot;some distance into the southern hemisphere&quot; in Harad.

The great harbour city of Umbar lies on Harad&#x27;s north-west coast; its natural harbour is the base of the Corsairs of Umbar, inspired by the Barbary pirates, who provide the Dark Lord Sauron with a sizeable fleet. The ships are different types of galleys, with both oars and sails; some are named as dromunds, others as having a deep draught (requiring a deep channel), many oars, and black sails.

Elsewhere in Harad there are &quot;many towns&quot;; one of these is &quot;the inland city&quot;, the home of Queen Berúthiel (mentioned by Tolkien in an interview). 
The Harad Road is the main overland route between Gondor and Harad.
Harad possesses jungles with apes, grasslands, and deserts.

Gondor described Harad as consisting of Near Harad and Far Harad. Near Harad corresponds loosely with North Africa or the Maghreb, while Far Harad, the vastly larger of the two regions, corresponds loosely with sub-Saharan Africa. Tolkien&#x27;s own annotated map of Middle-earth, used by the illustrator Pauline Baynes to construct her iconic map, suggests that &quot;Elephants appear in the great battle outside Minas Tirith (as they did in Italy under Pyrrhus) but they would be in place in the blank squares of Harad – also camels.&quot;

=== People ===


The Men of Harad are called &quot;Haradrim&quot; (&quot;South-multitude&quot;), &quot;Haradwaith&quot;, or &quot;Southrons&quot; by the people of Gondor. The Haradrim are of various ethnicities and cultures; some are organized into kingdoms. Frodo and Sam meet Faramir and his Rangers of Ithilien just before the latter ambush a company of Haradrim on the North Road. Frodo and Sam do not see much of the battle, since they are positioned elsewhere, but they hear the sounds of fighting, and a slain Haradrim warrior crashes at their feet. This warrior is described as having &quot;brown&quot; skin, with black plaits of hair braided with gold. He wears a scarlet tunic, as do the other Haradrim, and a gold collar. He is armed with a sword and has a corslet of brazen scales. Their standards are scarlet, and their great beasts, the &quot;mûmakil&quot;, have scarlet and gold trappings. They carry round spiked shields, painted yellow and black. Their leaders have a serpent emblem. The people of Far Harad were black-skinned; a group of them is described as &quot;black men like half-trolls with white eyes and red tongues&quot; and &quot;troll-men&quot;.

===History===
The Haradrim are independent peoples, but in the Second Age they are caught between the ambitions of Sauron (the Dark Lord) and the Númenóreans, who often kill Haradrim or sell them as slaves, and who become rulers of Harad. Over the centuries many Haradrim fall under Sauron&#x27;s dominion, and to &quot;them Sauron was both king and god, and they feared him exceedingly&quot;. They become mixed with Númenórean settlers, some of whom fall under the sway of Sauron as &quot;Black Númenóreans&quot;. Under King Hyarmendacil I &quot;South-victor&quot; of Gondor, Harad becomes a vassal of Gondor. By the time of the War of the Ring, the Haradrim are again under the dominion of Sauron, and the Haradrim Corsairs provide the whole of his Black Fleet; many other Haradrim join his armies, some riding &quot;mûmakil&quot;. In the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the leader of the Haradrim army is killed by King Théoden of Rohan.

Tolkien did not work out any particular languages for the Haradrim, though &quot;mûmak&quot;, &quot;elephant&quot;, may be in the Harad language. Despite having a meaning in Quenya (&quot;fate&quot;), the name &quot;Umbar&quot; is adapted from the natives&#x27; language and not from Elvish or Adûnaic.

== Concept and creation ==

=== &quot;Sigelwara Land&quot; ===

Tolkien arrived at the idea of Harad, a hot Southern land, through his philological work. The Old English Biblical poem &quot;Exodus&quot; in the tenth-century Codex Junius 11 includes a passage that caught Tolkien&#x27;s attention:

Tolkien was interested in particular in the Old English word used for &quot;Aethiopians&quot;: it was &quot;Sigelwara&quot;, or in Tolkien&#x27;s emendation &quot;Sigelhearwan&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that Tolkien&#x27;s philological research, described in his essay &quot;Sigelwara Land&quot;, began from the assumption that the word could not originally have meant Aethiopian, but must have been co-opted to that usage having once meant something comparable. Tolkien approached the question by analysing the two parts of the word. &quot;Sigel&quot; meant, according to Tolkien, &quot;both &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;jewel&quot;&quot;, the former as it was the Old English name of the Sun rune, Proto-Germanic: &quot;*sowilō&quot; (ᛋ), the latter connotation from Latin &quot;sigillum&quot;, a seal.

Tolkien decided that &quot;Hearwa&quot; was related to the Old English &quot;heorð&quot;, meaning &quot;hearth&quot;, and ultimately to the Latin &quot;carbo&quot;, meaning &quot;soot&quot;. The resulting meaning for &quot;Sigelhearwan&quot;, Tolkien decided tentatively, was &quot;rather the sons of Muspell than of Ham&quot;, an ancient class of demons in Northern mythology &quot;with red-hot eyes that emitted sparks and faces black as soot&quot;. This was exactly the sort of &quot;stray pagan concept&quot; hinting at England&#x27;s lost mythology that Tolkien wanted.

In drafts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Tolkien toyed with names such as &quot;Harwan&quot; and &quot;Sunharrowland&quot; for Harad, which were derived from &quot;Sigelwara&quot;; Christopher Tolkien notes that these are connected to his father&#x27;s &quot;Sigelwara Land&quot;. The philologist Elizabeth Solopova similarly notes that the hobbits&#x27; name for Harad, &quot;Sunland&quot;, suggests a similar link.

=== Moral geography ===

The Germanic studies scholar Sandra Ballif Straubhaar notes that it is not clear whether Tolkien meant the Haradrim to be grouped with his &quot;Wild Men&quot;, though he named them as ancient enemies of Gondor. They are &quot;ethnic others but not as ugly&quot;, they have a rich culture and well-trained elephants. The exception would be, she suggests, the men of Far [Southern] Harad whom the people of Gondor saw as &quot;black men like half-trolls with white eyes and red tongues&quot;. With his &quot;Southrons&quot; from Harad, Tolkien had – in the view of John Magoun, writing in &quot;The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; – constructed a &quot;fully expressed moral geography&quot;, from the hobbits&#x27; home in the Northwest, evil in the East, and &quot;imperial sophistication and decadence&quot; in the South. Magoun explains that Gondor is both virtuous, being West, and has problems, being South; Mordor in the Southeast is hellish, while Harad in the extreme South &quot;regresses into hot savagery&quot;.

Solopova argues that the Haradrim&#x27;s &quot;mûmakil&quot; war elephants put their country far to the East, since only India and lands to its east went on using war elephants after classical times. She and Stuart D. Lee mention that Tolkien could have used the Old English version by Ælfric of the &quot;Book of Maccabees&quot;, which carefully introduces elephants to its Anglo-Saxon audience, using much the same phrase as Sam Gamgee, &quot;māre þonne sum hūs&quot;, &quot;bigger than a house&quot;, before describing their use in battle; the hero stabs the elephant, which is carrying a &quot;wīghūs&quot;, a &quot;battle-house&quot;, from below. Tolkien however mentioned Pyrrhus of Epirus&#x27;s use of war elephants against Ancient Rome in 280–275 BC in his notes for the illustrator Pauline Baynes.

=== The stereotypical &quot;Other&quot; ===

Commentators such as Anderson Rearick and Stephen Shapiro have identified the Haradrim as a recognisably foreign race as well as the enemy, and have accused Tolkien of racism. Conversely, scholars such as Straubhaar have come to Tolkien&#x27;s defence on the matter, noting that during the Second World War Tolkien expressed an anti-racist position. Straubhaar writes that &quot;a polycultured, polylingual world is absolutely central&quot; to Middle-earth, and that readers and filmgoers will easily see that. From there, she notes that the &quot;recurring accusations in the popular media&quot; of a racist view of the story are &quot;interesting&quot;. She quotes the Swedish cultural studies scholar David Tjeder who described Gollum&#x27;s account of the men of Harad (&quot;Not nice; very cruel wicked Men they look. Almost as bad as Orcs, and much bigger.&quot;) in &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; as &quot;stereotypical and reflective of colonial attitudes&quot;. She argues instead that Gollum&#x27;s view, with its &quot;arbitrary and stereotypical assumptions about the &#x27;Other&#x27;&quot;, is absurd, and that Gollum cannot be taken as an authority on Tolkien&#x27;s opinion. Straubhaar contrasts this with Sam Gamgee&#x27;s more humane response to the sight of a dead Harad warrior, which she finds &quot;harder to find fault with&quot;: &quot;He was glad that he could not see the dead face. He wondered what the man&#x27;s name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of heart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home.&quot; Straubhaar quotes Shapiro, who wrote in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; that &quot;Put simply, Tolkien&#x27;s good guys are white and the bad guys are black, slant-eyed, unattractive, inarticulate, and a psychologically undeveloped horde&quot;. Straubhaar concedes that Shapiro may have had a point with &quot;slant-eyed&quot;, but comments that this was milder than that of many of his contemporary novelists such as John Buchan, and notes that Tolkien had in fact made &quot;appalled objection&quot; when people had misapplied his story to current events. She similarly observes that Tjeder had failed to notice Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;concerted effort&quot; to change the Western European &quot;paradigm&quot; that speakers of supposedly superior languages were &quot;ethnically superior&quot;.

==In other media ==

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s film &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, the Haradrim appear Middle Eastern, with turbans, flowing robes, and riding &quot;mûmakil&quot;. A companion book on the film&#x27;s &quot;Creatures&quot; states that the Haradrim were based on 12th century Saracens. The battle scene in Ithilien between the rangers of Gondor and the men of Harad was shot at the Twelve Mile Delta near Queenstown, New Zealand.

The Haradrim and the Corsairs of Umbar appear in merchandise for the film trilogy, such as toys, &quot;The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game&quot;, and the computer game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II&quot;. &quot;Haradrim Slayers&quot; feature in the computer game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring&quot;, while in the video game &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of War&quot;, Baranor, a playable character who is a captain in Gondor&#x27;s guard, is originally from Harad.

Iron Crown Enterprises produced a series of books for their tabletop roleplaying game &quot;Middle-earth Role Playing&quot; containing information about Harad and content allowing games to be set there. Key publications included the setting books &quot;Umbar: Haven of the Corsairs&quot; (1982), &quot;Far Harad&quot; (1988), and &quot;Greater Harad&quot; (1990), as well as the adventure books &quot;Warlords of the Desert&quot; (1989), &quot;Forest of Tears&quot; (1989), and &quot;Hazards of the Harad Wood&quot; (1990). Games Workshop have produced miniatures and rules relating to Harad for use in the &quot;Middle Earth Strategy Battle Game&quot;, including for &quot;mumakil&quot; and Corsairs of Umbar.

<doc id="380421" wikidata="Q47012" url="?curid=380421" title="Expressways in South Korea">
<text>Expressways () in South Korea, officially known as National Expressways (), are controlled-access highways that form the highest level of the country&#x27;s road network. Most sections are tolled and maintained by the Korea Expressway Corporation, though a few routes are built and managed by approved private companies.

== History ==
On 2 September 1967, the first expressway of South Korea, nowadays Gyeongin Expressway, was assigned as Second-class National Highway 95 Seoul–Incheon () by the presidential decree. The very first section of expressway was opened on 21 December 1968. At first, expressways were assigned as a part of national highways, but since 31 August 1971, they were assigned as the new separated class: National Expressways.

Under the new numbering scheme implemented on 25 August 2001, expressway numbers were assigned based on a grid system, reflecting the layout proposed in the 3rd Comprehensive National Territorial Planning () in 1992. This updated system was influenced by the numbering conventions of the Interstate Highway System in the United States. The details are:
* Trunk routes: These are numbered with two digits. North–south routes are assigned odd numbers, while east–west routes are given even numbers. Primary routes are numbered progressively from south to north or west to east, with the first digit increasing and the last digit ending in either 5 or 0.
* Branch routes: Branch routes off trunk routes have three-digit numbers, with the first two digits corresponding to the main trunk route number.
* Circular routes: Circular routes are numbered in increments of 100, based on the postal code system used from 1988 to 2015.
** Seoul: 1, Capital Region First Ring Expressway (Expressway 100)
** Daejeon/Chungcheong: 3, Daejeon Southern Ring Expressway (Expressway 300)
** Incheon/Gyeonggi: 4, Capital Region Second Ring Expressway (Expressway 400)
** Gwangju/Jeolla: 5, Gwangju Ring Expressway (Expressway 500)
** Busan/South Gyeongsang: Busan Ring Expressway (Expressway 600)
** Daegu/North Gyeongsang: Daegu Ring Expressway (Expressway 700)
* Route numbers ranging from 70 to 99 are reserved for potential use following Korean reunification and are currently unused.
* There are a few exceptions:
** The Gyeongbu Expressway is an exception to the numbering rules. Due to its critical importance in the network, it retains the route number 1.
** There are multiple east–west branches on Capital Region First Ring Expressway (Expressway 100), but they are not numbered as the rule of branch routes; instead, they are numbered 110, 120, and 130, respectively.

The current highway shield for expressways is inspired by U.S. highway signage, combining the shape of U.S. Highway shields with the red, white, and blue color scheme of U.S. Interstate shields which are the same colors used in the South Korean flag.

Most of the expressway network is managed by the Korea Expressway Corporation. Since 2000, however, some routes have been constructed and operated by private companies under government approval. These privately operated routes are managed for a limited time before transitioning to public control.

== List of expressways ==
=== Numbering scheme until 2001 ===
== Electronic toll collection ==
Hi-pass is the name of an electronic toll collection system for the expressways in South Korea.

Some interchanges are designed only for cars with hi-pass.

== Traffic restrictions ==

From Sintanjin interchange, Daejeon to Yangjae interchange, Seoul, a pair of central lanes are dedicated as a bus lane on holidays; technically, it is operated as HOV-6 with cars with 9+ passenger capacity. On weekdays, the restriction is narrowed to Anseong interchange, Anseong to Yangjae interchange.

Since June 1, 1972, all motorcycles except police motorcycles are prohibited from driving on expressways in South Korea, regardless of engine displacement. Before 1972, motorcycles with an engine displacement greater than 250 cc were permitted on expressways.

Since March 15, 1992, all motorcycles except police motorcycles have been banned from certain other roads designated for motor vehicles only. These roads are marked by a circular blue sign with a white silhouette of a car.

<doc id="380437" wikidata="Q465759" url="?curid=380437" title="Jan Czochralski">
<text>Jan Czochralski (; 23 October 1885 – 22 April 1953) was a Polish chemist who invented the Czochralski method, which is used for growing single crystals and in the production of semiconductor wafers. It is still used in over 90 percent of all electronics in the world that use semiconductors. He is the most cited Polish scholar.

There is evidence that Czochralski sheltered two Jewish women in his home until the Warsaw Uprising to save them from the Germans and some evidence that he was instrumental in financially helping a previously owned Jewish business in the ghetto.

==Life and career==

Czochralski was born in what was then Exin in the Prussian Province of Posen, German Empire (now Kcynia, Poland). Around 1900 he moved to Berlin, where he worked at a pharmacy. He was educated at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (today Technische Universität Berlin), where he specialized in metal chemistry. Czochralski began working as an engineer for Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft (AEG) in 1907.

He discovered the Czochralski method in 1916, when he accidentally dipped his pen into a crucible of molten tin rather than his inkwell. He immediately pulled his pen out to discover that a thin thread of solidified metal was hanging from the nib. The nib was replaced by a capillary, and Czochralski verified that the crystallized metal was a single crystal. Czochralski&#x27;s experiments produced single crystals a millimeter in diameter and up to 150 centimeters long. He published a paper on his discovery in 1918 in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie, a German chemistry journal, under the title &quot;Ein neues Verfahren zur Messung der Kristallisationsgeschwindigkeit der Metalle&quot; [A new method for the measurement of the crystallization rate of metals], since the method was at that time used for measuring the crystallization rate of metals such as tin, zinc and lead. In 1948, Americans Gordon K. Teal and J.B. Little from Bell Labs would use the method to grow single germanium crystals, leading to its use in semiconductor production.

In 1917, Czochralski organized the research laboratory &quot;Metallbank und Metallurgische Gesellschaft&quot;, which he directed until 1928. In 1919 he was one of the founding members of the German Society for Metals Science (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Metallkunde), of which he was president until 1925. In 1924, Czochralski patented a metal alloy known as B-metal, which was perfect for the manufacturing of bearings for railway carriages as it did not contain expensive tin. The German railways were the first institution to buy the patent. B-metal allowed trains to travel at higher speeds and played a significant role in the development of rail transport in Germany, Poland, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. Czochralski’s achievements brought him international recognition. In 1925, he became the president of the German Association of Metallurgists. He was also invited by Henry Ford to visit his factories and offered the position of director at his new aluminum factory, but Czochralski declined.

In 1928, at the request of the president of Poland, Ignacy Mościcki, he moved to Poland and was appointed the Professor of Metallurgy and Metal Research at the Chemistry Department of the Warsaw University of Technology. He also became of the first individuals to receive the university&#x27;s honorary degrees. In the 1930s, his institute acquired new equipment and facilities, which were used for research into materials for military armaments and some for civilian use. Following Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland, senior German officials visited him, hoping to use his facility for their own purposes. During the German occupation of Warsaw, more restrictions on daily life were imposed on the population; however, Czochralski was able to live largely undisturbed.

After World War II, he was stripped of his professorship by the communist regime due to his involvement with Germany during the war, although he was later cleared of any wrongdoing by a Polish court. He returned to his native town of Kcynia, where he ran a small cosmetics and household chemicals firm until his death in 1953.

==Remembrance==

As a way to commemorate him, a number of places in Poland were named after Jan Czochralski including schools and streets in such cities like Gdańsk, Poznań, Bydgoszcz and Wrocław.

In 2004, the European Materials Research Society established the Jan Czochralski Gold Medal for contributions to materials science in honour of the Polish scientist.

In 2009, the Polish Post issued a series of four commemorative stamps. The stamp with a denomination of PLN 1,55 depicted Jan Czochralski.

In 2012, the Polish Parliament passed a resolution to name 2013 as &quot;The Year of Jan Czochralski&quot;.

In 2016, a team of Polish mineralogists led by Łukasz Karwowski from the Silesian University and Andrzej Muszyński from the Adam Mickiewicz University named a newly-discovered mineral &quot;czochralskiit&quot; in honour of the Polish chemist. It was discovered during scientific works in the Morasko Meteorite Nature Reserve.

In 2018, a comic book by Maciej Jasiński and Jacek Michalski entitled &quot;Jan Czochralski. The Man Who Changed the World&quot; (Polish: &quot;Jan Czochralski. Człowiek, który zmienił świat&quot;) was officially published.
In 2019, a commemorative IEEE Milestone plaque honouring Czochralski&#x27;s scientific achievements was ceremonially unveiled at the Warsaw University of Technology.

In 2019, a square in front of the Mill of Knowledge Innovation Centre in Toruń was named in memory of Jan Czochralski.

== Citizenship ==
Jan Czochralski renounced his German citizenship. His brother was murdered by the Germans at the beginning of the Second World War.

<text>The Soviet Military Administration in Germany (; &quot;Sovyetskaya Voyennaya Administratsiya v Germanii&quot;, SVAG; , SMAD) was the Soviet military government, headquartered in Berlin-Karlshorst, that directly ruled the Soviet occupation zone in Germany from the German surrender in May 1945 until after the establishment of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in October 1949.

According to the Potsdam Agreement in 1945, the SMAD was assigned the eastern portion of present-day Germany, consisting mostly of central Prussia. Prussia was dissolved by the Allies in 1947 and this area was divided between several German states &quot;(Länder)&quot;. German lands east of the Oder-Neisse line were annexed by Soviet Union or granted to Poland, and Germans living in these areas were forcibly expelled, having had their property expropriated and been robbed of most of their belongings whilst in transit to the American, British, and Soviet zones.

== Notable SVAG officials ==
* Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov, supreme commander of SMAG, 1945–46
* Marshal of the Soviet Union Vasily Sokolovsky, supreme commander of SMAG, 1946–49
* Marshal of the Soviet Union Vasily Chuikov, supreme commander of the SMAG, March 1949– October 1949
* Major general Sergei Ivanovich Tiulpanov, director of the Propaganda Administration 
* Lieutenant colonel Aleksandr Dymshits, director of the Cultural Department 
* Colonel general Vladimir Kurasov, chief of staff

==Actions of the SMAD==
The main purpose of the SMAD was to maintain the unity of Germany. It also had to deal with refugees, such as those resettled from Poland, the homeless, and former German soldiers. Resources were short, and the economy needed to be shifted from wartime production to peacetime. However, the Soviets were also concerned with their own well-being, and dismantled entire factories and railroads to be reassembled in the USSR.

In late 1945 a land reform confiscated the land of German nobles &quot;(Junker)&quot;, to be given to cottagers and landless farmhands. Banks were also nationalized that year. In 1946 an education reform established separation of church and state in elementary schools, and heavy industries were nationalized under the guise of confiscation of the property of Nazi war criminals.

The SMAD set up ten &quot;special camps&quot; for the detention of Germans, some of them former Nazi concentration camps. In 1947, they started prosecuting Nazi crimes based on the SMAD Directive 201 with 8,300 verdicts passed.

==Politics==

A decree of 10 June 1945 allowed for the formation of antifascist democratic political parties and called for elections in October 1946. A coalition of four parties was formed in July, consisting of the Communist (KPD), Social Democratic (SPD), Liberal Democratic and (eastern) Christian Democratic (CDU) parties. This coalition was known as the Democratic Bloc, which would be succeeded by the National Front in 1950. In April 1946 the KPD and SPD merged under Soviet pressure into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (&quot;Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands&quot; – SED). In the October 1946 elections, the SED won in the East German states, but lost in Greater Berlin to the local SPD, which had not merged with the KPD there.

In May 1949, when a West German government began to be formed, a German People&#x27;s Congress (&quot;Deutscher Volkskongreß&quot;) was elected for the Soviet occupation zone. However, the only options voters had were to approve or reject &quot;unity lists&quot; of pre-picked candidates from the various parties, largely made up of communists. About two-thirds of East Germans approved the list for the new Congress.

In November 1948, the German Economic Commission (&quot;Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission&quot; – DWK) assumed administrative authority in East Germany under Soviet supervision. On 7 October 1949, the German People&#x27;s Congress formed a provisional government and established the German Democratic Republic with Wilhelm Pieck as its first president. On 5 November 1949, the SMAD was abolished and replaced by the Soviet Control Commission (&quot;Sowjetische Kontrolkommission&quot; – SKK). However, the SKK did not formally turn over administrative responsibilities to the GDR government until 11 November 1949.

<text>Major General Sergei Ivanovich Tiulpanov (Russian: Сергей Иванович Тюльпанов; 3 October 1901 – 16 February 1987) was a Soviet economist and the director of the Propaganda Administration of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany which governed eastern Germany from 1945–1949.

Tiulpanov spoke fluent German. He was a strong supporter of Walter Ulbricht and of the Sovietization of eastern Germany. He closely monitored the activities of the newly formed Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which was to govern the country.

Tiulpanov considered himself a hardline Bolshevik, and fell from favor as it became clear that Joseph Stalin did not support his and Ulbricht&#x27;s plans for the rapid establishment of socialism in eastern Germany. Tiulpanov was recalled from his post to Moscow in 1949 on the basis that he failed to report some of his associates that were convicted of betrayal.

From 1950 he was of deputy head of the department of political economy of the Naval Academy in Leningrad and then he became head of the department of political economy of the Budyonny Military Academy of the Signal Corps. 

Tiulpanov retired from the military in 1956 and dedicated the rest of his life to academia, first as vice-rector of Leningrad State University, and from 1957 dean of the department of economics of modern capitalism that he himself had founded. In 1956 he received an honorary doctorate from the Karl Marx Leipzig University. 

Tiulpanov died in 1987 and was buried at the Serafimovskoye cemetery.

<text>Chittagong ( ), officially Chattogram, (, ) (, or ) is the second-largest city in Bangladesh. Home to the Port of Chittagong, it is the busiest port in Bangladesh and the Bay of Bengal. The city is also the business capital of Bangladesh. It is the administrative seat of an eponymous division and district. The city is located on the banks of the Karnaphuli River between the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the Bay of Bengal. The Greater Chittagong Area had a population of more than 140 million in 2022. In 2022, the Chittagong District had a population of approximately 9.2 Million according to a census conducted by Government of Bangladesh. In 2022, the city area had a population of more than 5.6 million. The city is home to many large local businesses and plays an important role in the Bangladeshi economy.

One of the world&#x27;s oldest ports with a functional natural harbor for centuries, Chittagong appeared on ancient Greek and Roman maps, including on Ptolemy&#x27;s world map. It was located on the southern branch of the Silk Road. In the 9th century, merchants from the Abbasid Caliphate established a trading post in Chittagong. The port fell to the Muslim conquest of Bengal during the 14th century. It was the site of a royal mint under the Delhi Sultanate, Bengal Sultanate and Mughal Empire. Between the 15th and 17th centuries, Chittagong was also a centre of administrative, literary, commercial and maritime activities in Arakan, a narrow strip of land along the eastern coast of the Bay of Bengal which was under strong Bengali influence for 350 years. During the 16th century, the port became a Portuguese trading post and João de Barros described it as &quot;the most famous and wealthy city of the Kingdom of Bengal&quot;. The Mughal Empire expelled the Portuguese and Arakanese in 1666.

The Nawab of Bengal ceded the port to the British East India Company in 1793. The Port of Chittagong was re-organized in 1887 and its busiest shipping links were with British Burma. In 1928, Chittagong was declared a &quot;Major Port&quot; of British India. During World War II, Chittagong was a base for Allied Forces engaged in the Burma Campaign. The port city began to expand and industrialize during the 1940s, particularly after the Partition of British India. The city was the historic terminus of the Assam Bengal Railway and Pakistan Eastern Railway. During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, Chittagong was the site of the Bangladeshi declaration of independence. The port city has benefited from the growth of heavy industry, logistics, and manufacturing in Bangladesh. Trade unionism was strong during the 1990s.

Chittagong accounts for 12% of Bangladesh&#x27;s GDP, including 40% of industrial output, 80% of international trade, and 50% of tax revenue. The port city is home to many of the oldest and largest companies in the country. The Port of Chittagong is one of the busiest ports in South Asia. The largest base of the Bangladesh Navy is located in Chittagong, along with an air base of the Bangladesh Air Force, garrisons of the Bangladesh Army and the main base of the Bangladesh Coast Guard. The eastern zone of the Bangladesh Railway is based in Chittagong. The Chittagong Stock Exchange is one of the twin stock markets of Bangladesh with over 700 listed companies. The Chittagong Tea Auction is a commodity exchange dealing with Bangladeshi tea. The CEPZ and KEPZ are key industrial zones with foreign direct investments. The city is served by Shah Amanat International Airport for domestic and external flights. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel, the first and only underwater road tunnel of South Asia, is located in Chittagong. The city is the hometown of prominent economists, a Nobel laureate, scientists, freedom fighters and entrepreneurs. Chittagong has a high degree of religious and ethnic diversity among Bangladeshi cities, despite having a great Muslim majority. Minorities include Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Chakmas, Marmas, Tripuris, Garos and others.

==Etymology==

The etymology of &quot;Chittagong&quot; is uncertain. The port city has been known by various names in history, including &quot;Chatigaon&quot;, &quot;Chatigam&quot;, &quot;Chattagrama&quot;, &quot;Islamabad&quot;, &quot;Chattala&quot;, &quot;Chaityabhumi&quot; and &quot;Porto Grande De Bengala&quot;.

The Bengali word for Chittagong, &quot;Chattogram (চট্টগ্রাম)&quot;, has the suffix- &quot;Chatto&quot; (চট্ট/আদর্শ) &quot;Gram&quot; (গ্রাম) meaning village in Standard Bengali. The earliest records, before Islam reached the region, state that it was a place of chaitya or Buddhist monasteries. The city had a very large Buddhist population before Islam. The city was renamed &quot;Islamabad (City of Islam)&quot; during the Mughal era. The name continues to be used in the old city. In April 2018, the Cabinet Division of the Government of Bangladesh decided to change the city&#x27;s name to Chattogram, based on its Bengali spelling and pronunciation; the move was criticized in the Bangladeshi media.

One explanation credits the first Arab traders for &quot;shatt ghangh&quot; () where &quot;shatt&quot; means &quot;Delta&quot; and &quot;ghangh&quot; stood for the Ganges. The Arakanese chronicle that a king named Tsu-la-taing Tsandaya (Sula Taing Chandra), after conquering Bengal, set up a stone pillar as a trophy/memorial at the place since called &quot;Tst-ta-gaung&quot; as the limit of conquest.

==History==

Stone Age fossils and tools unearthed in the region indicate that Chittagong has been inhabited since Neolithic times. It is an ancient port city, with a recorded history dating back to the 4th century BC. Its harbour was mentioned in Ptolemy&#x27;s world map in the 2nd century as one of the most impressive ports in the East. The region was part of the ancient Bengali Samatata and Harikela kingdoms. The Chandra dynasty once dominated the area and was followed by the Varman dynasty and Deva dynasty.

Chinese traveller Xuanzang described the area as &quot;a sleeping beauty rising from mist and water&quot; in the 7th century.

Many Sufi missionaries settled in Chittagong and played an instrumental role in the spread of Islam.

Sultan Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah of Sonargaon conquered Chittagong in 1340, making it a part of Sultanate of Bengal. It was the principal maritime gateway to the kingdom, which was reputed as one of the wealthiest states in the Indian subcontinent. Medieval Chittagong was a hub for maritime trade with China, Sumatra, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, the Middle East, and East Africa. It was notable for its medieval trades in pearls, silk, muslin, rice, bullion, horses, and gunpowder. The port was also a major shipbuilding hub.

Ibn Battuta visited the port city in 1345. Niccolò de&#x27; Conti, from Venice, also visited around the same time as Battuta. Chinese admiral Zheng He&#x27;s treasure fleet anchored in Chittagong during imperial missions to the Sultanate of Bengal.

Dhaniya Manikya conquered Chittagong in 1513. Hossain Shah sent his noble commander Gorai Mallik to attack Tripura. Gorai Mallik recaptured the territories lost. But the following year Dhaniya Manikya again conquered Chittagong.

The Arakanese ruled over Chittagong spanned from the late 16th century to 1666, marking a significant yet turbulent era in the region&#x27;s history. The Kingdom of Mrauk U, centered in present-day Myanmar, expanded into south-eastern Bengal, with Chittagong becoming a strategic part of its domain. The Arakanese maintained their power through alliances with the Portuguese, who were instrumental in fortifying their control. Chittagong evolved into a centre of trade and piracy during this time, with Portuguese and Arakanese forces frequently raiding Mughal territories. The blending of Bengali, Buddhist, and Portuguese influences made the region a unique cultural and administrative frontier.

The decline of Arakanese rule was triggered by political conflicts, including their involvement in the Mughal succession struggle. The assassination of Mughal prince Shah Shuja in Arakan strained relations with the Mughal Empire, prompting a decisive campaign led by Subahdar Shaista Khan in 1666. The Mughals recaptured Chittagong, ending nearly a century of Arakanese dominance. This period left a lasting legacy on the region, highlighting the interplay of trade, politics, and cultural exchange between Bengal and Arakan.

Chittagong featured prominently in the military history of the Bengal Sultanate, including during the Reconquest of Arakan and the Bengal Sultanate–Kingdom of Mrauk U War of 1512–1516.


During the 13th and 16th centuries, Arabs and Persians heavily colonized the port city of Chittagong, initially arriving for trade and to spread Islam. Most Arab settlers arrived from the trade route between Iraq and Chittagong and were perhaps the prime reason for the spread of Islam to Bangladesh. The first Persian settlers also arrived for trade and religious purposes, with the possible goal of Persianisation as well. Persians and other Iranic peoples have deeply affected the history of the Bengal Sultanate, with Persian being one of the main languages of the Muslim state, as well as also influencing the Chittagonian language and writing scripts. It has been affirmed that much of the Muslim population in Chittagong are descendants of the Arab and Persian settlers.

Two decades after Vasco Da Gama&#x27;s landing in Calicut, the Bengal Sultanate permitted the Portuguese settlement in Chittagong to be established in 1528. It became the first European colonial enclave in Bengal. The Bengal Sultanate lost control of Chittagong in 1531 after Arakan declared independence and the established Kingdom of Mrauk U. This altered geopolitical landscape allowed the Portuguese unhindered control of Chittagong for over a century.

Portuguese ships from Goa and Malacca began frequenting the port city in the 16th century. The &quot;cartaz&quot; system was introduced and required all ships in the area to purchase naval trading licenses from the Portuguese settlement. Slave trade and piracy flourished. The nearby island of Sandwip was conquered in 1602. In 1615, the Portuguese Navy defeated a joint Dutch East India Company and Arakanese fleet near the coast of Chittagong.

In 1666, the Mughal government of Bengal led by viceroy Shaista Khan moved to retake Chittagong from Portuguese and Arakanese control by launching the Mughal conquest of Chittagong. The Mughals attacked the Arakanese from the jungle with a 6,500-strong army, which was further supported by 288 Mughal naval ships blockading the Chittagong harbor. After three days of battle, the Arakanese surrendered. The Mughals expelled the Portuguese from Chittagong. Mughal rule ushered a new era in the history of Chittagong territory to the southern bank of Kashyapnadi (Kaladan River). The port city was renamed Islamabad. The Grand Trunk Road connected it with North India and Central Asia. Economic growth increased due to an efficient system of land grants for clearing hinterlands for cultivation. The Mughals also contributed to the architecture of the area, including the building of Fort Ander and many mosques. Chittagong was integrated into the prosperous Bengali economy, which also included Orissa and Bihar. Shipbuilding increased dramatically under the Mughal rule, and the Ottoman Sultans had many Ottoman warships built in Chittagong during this period.

In 1685, the British East India Company sent out an expedition under Admiral Nicholson with the instructions to seize and fortify Chittagong on behalf of the English; however, the expedition proved abortive. Two years later, the company&#x27;s Court of Directors decided to make Chittagong the headquarters of their Bengal trade and sent out a fleet of ten or eleven ships to seize it under Captain Heath. However, after reaching Chittagong in early 1689, the fleet found the city too strongly held and abandoned their attempt at capturing it. The city was possessed by the Nawab of Bengal until 1793 when East India Company took complete control of the former Mughal province of Bengal.

The First Anglo-Burmese War in 1823 threatened the British hold on Chittagong. There were several rebellions against British rule, notably during the Indian rebellion of 1857, when the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th companies of the 34th Bengal Infantry Regiment revolted and released all prisoners from the city&#x27;s jail. In a backlash, the rebels were suppressed by the Sylhet Light Infantry.

Arakan was annexed in 1829 and incorporated into the Bengal Presidency. Agriculturalists from Chittagong played a key role in the development of the rice economy in Arakan. The economy of northern Arakan was integrated with the Chittagong economy. During this period, Arakan Division became one of the top rice exporters in the world. Bengalis from Chittagong were vital to the success of Arakan&#x27;s rice industry.

Railways were introduced in 1865, beginning with the Eastern Bengal Railway connecting Chittagong to Dacca and Calcutta. Chittagong became the main gateway to Eastern Bengal and Assam. In the 1890s, Chittagong became the terminus of Assam Bengal Railway. The hinterland of Chittagong Port covered the tea and jute producing regions of Assam and Bengal, as well as Assam&#x27;s oil industry. Chittagong was also linked to the crucial oil and gas industry in Burma. Chittagong was a major center of trade with British Burma. It hosted many prominent companies of the British Empire.

The Chittagong armoury raid by Bengali revolutionaries in 1930 was a major event in British India&#x27;s anti-colonial history.

===World War II===

During World War II, Chittagong became a frontline city in the Southeast Asian Theater. It was a critical air, naval and military base for Allied Forces during the Burma Campaign against Japan. The Imperial Japanese Army Air Force carried out air raids on Chittagong in April and May 1942, in the run-up to the aborted Japanese invasion of Bengal.

After the Battle of Imphal, the tide turned in favour of the Allied Forces. Units of the United States Army Air Forces&#x27; 4th Combat Cargo Group were stationed in Chittagong Airfield in 1945. Commonwealth forces included troops from Britain, India, Australia, and New Zealand. The war had major negative impacts on the city, including the growth of refugees and the Great Famine of 1943. Many wealthy Chittagonians profited from wartime commerce.

715 soldiers are buried at the Chittagong War Cemetery, which is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Allied soldiers constitute the bulk of burials in the cemetery. A few Japanese soldiers are also buried. Remembrance Day services are held each year at the cemetery, with diplomats from Commonwealth countries like the UK, Bangladesh, Australia, India and Pakistan, as well as the United States and Japan, usually in attendance.

===Modern===
The Partition of British India in 1947 made Chittagong the chief port of East Pakistan. By March 1948, the Chittagong harbour became a bustling port for international shipping. The Chittagong Tea Auction was set up in 1949. The port city had branches of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, Burmah Oil (known locally as Burmah Eastern), and the James Finlay shipping business. Wealthy Muslim families from British India and British Burma shifted their corporate headquarters to Chittagong. The Ispahani family shifted the head office of M. M. Ispahani Limited from Calcutta to Chittagong. The Ispahanis also relocated the Eastern Federal Insurance Company from Calcutta to Chittagong. The Ispahanis set up the Victory Jute Mills, the Chittagong Jute Manufacturing Company, and the Pahartali Textile Mills. The Africawala brothers set up the first steel re-rolling mills in Chittagong in 1952, which eventually became BSRM. Banks, shipping companies and insurance firms proliferated the city. Many British-owned businesses in East Pakistan were based in Chittagong. Britain&#x27;s former flag carrier BOAC operated flights to the city. The Agrabad area emerged as the central business district in the 1950s and 1960s, with many corporate offices. The Ispahani Building and Jamuna Bhaban are some of the corporate buildings from this period. The Karnaphuli Paper Mills were built in 1959. The project to build the Eastern Refinery was started in 1963; and was partly funded by the last Shah of Iran. The Agrabad Chamber of Commerce was formed in 1963. It later became the Foreign Investors&#x27; Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Bangladesh. The Chittagong Development Authority (CDA) was created by the government to promote urban planning; while wealthy families like the Ispahanis contributed to social welfare by setting up schools and hospitals.

The lawyer and industrialist A K Khan, who set up A K Khan &amp; Company in the aftermath of World War II, represented Chittagong in the federal cabinet of East and West Pakistan. However, East Pakistanis complained of a lack of investment in Chittagong in comparison to Karachi in West Pakistan, even though East Pakistan generated more exports and had a larger population. The Awami League demanded that the country&#x27;s naval headquarters be shifted from Karachi to Chittagong.

During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, which was waged under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Chittagong witnessed heavy fighting between rebel Bengali military regiments and the Pakistan Army. It covered Sector 1 in the Mukti Bahini chain of command. Major Ziaur Rahman was the sector commander. The Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence was broadcast from Kalurghat Radio Station and transmitted internationally through foreign ships in Chittagong Port. Ziaur Rahman and M A Hannan announced the independence declaration from Chittagong. A K Khan drafted the English version of Zia&#x27;s broadcast. These radio broadcasts began the journey of Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra, which contributed heavily towards the Liberation. The Pakistani military, and supporting Razakar militias, carried out widespread atrocities against civilians in the city. Mukti Bahini naval commandos drowned several Pakistani warships during Operation Jackpot in August 1971. In December 1971, the Bangladesh Air Force and the Indian Air Force carried out the heavy bombing of facilities occupied by the Pakistani military. A naval blockade was also enforced.

After the war, the Soviet Union offer to clear mines in Chittagong Port at free of cost, while Sweden offered to clear mines in Mongla port. 22 vessels of the Soviet Pacific Fleet sailed from Vladivostok to Chittagong in May 1972. The process of clearing mines in the dense water harbor took nearly a year and claimed the life of Soviet marine Yuri V Redkin. Chittagong soon regained its status as a major port, with cargo tonnage surpassing pre-war levels in 1973. In the immediate aftermath of 1971, many industries were nationalized. But in Chittagong, factories and business properties were given back to their private owners. The Ispahani family had to write only one letter in order to get back all their properties from the Awami League government of Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

In free market reforms launched by President Ziaur Rahman in the late 1970s, the city became home to the first export processing zones in Bangladesh. Zia was assassinated during an attempted military coup in Chittagong in 1981. The 1991 Bangladesh cyclone inflicted heavy damage on the city. The Japanese government financed the construction of several heavy industries and an international airport in the 1980s and 1990s. Bangladeshi private sector investments increased since 1991, especially with the formation of the Chittagong Stock Exchange in 1995. A new airport opened in 2000. The port city has been the pivot of Bangladesh&#x27;s emerging economy in recent years, with the country&#x27;s rising GDP growth rate. Chittagong has seen several infrastructure projects taken up by the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, including the Chittagong Elevated Expressway, the first underwater tunnel in South Asia, the expansion of its port, and new parks, power plants and flyovers.

Another dish named &quot;kala-bhuna&quot; of Chittagong, made with traditional spices, mustard oil, and beef through a special cooking style, is also renowned all over Bangladesh. The cultivation of pink pearls is a historic activity in Chittagong. Its Mughal-era name, &quot;Islamabad&quot; (City of Islam), continues to be used in the old city. The name was given due to the port city&#x27;s history as a gateway for early Islamic missionaries in Bengal. Notable Islamic architecture in Chittagong can be seen in the historic Bengal Sultanate-era Hammadyar Mosque and the Mughal Fort of Anderkilla. Chittagong is known as the &quot;Land of the Twelve Saints&quot; due to the prevalence of major Sufi Muslim shrines in the district.

<text>Chittagong Division () officially Chattogram Division, is geographically the largest of the eight administrative divisions of Bangladesh. It covers the south-easternmost areas of the country, with a total area of and a population at the 2022 census of 33,202,326. The administrative division includes mainland Chittagong District, neighbouring districts and the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

Chittagong Division is home to Cox&#x27;s Bazar, the longest natural sea beach in the world; as well as St. Martin&#x27;s Island, Bangladesh&#x27;s sole coral reef.

==History==

The Chittagong as an administrative division was established in 1829 to serve as an administrative headquarters for five of Bengal&#x27;s easternmost districts, with the Chittagong District serving as its headquarters. In East Pakistan, the division&#x27;s Tippera district was renamed as Comilla District in 1960.

In 1984, fifteen districts were created by separating and reducing the original five districts of Chittagong, Comilla, Hill Tracts, Noakhali and Sylhet:
*The Chittagong District was divided into two districts; Chittagong and Cox&#x27;s Bazar District
*The Comilla District was split into three districts; Comilla, Brahmanbaria and Chandpur
*The Hill Tracts District was split into three districts; Bandarban, Khagrachhari and Rangamati
*The Noakhali District was divided into three districts; Noakhali, Lakshmipur and Feni
*The Sylhet District was split into four districts; Sylhet, Habiganj, Moulvibazar and Sunamganj.

Sylhet, Habiganj, Moulvibazar and Sunamganj district ceded from the Chittagong Division to join a newly established Sylhet Division in 1995.

==Administration==
Chittagong Division is presently subdivided into eleven districts (zilas) and thence into 100 sub-districts (upazilas). The first six districts listed below comprise the north-western portion (37.6%) of the division, while the remaining five comprise the south-eastern portion (62.4%), the two portions being separated by the lower (or Bangladeshi) stretch of the Feni River; the upland districts of Khagrachhari, Rangamati and Bandarban together comprise that area previously known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

== Demographics ==

According to the 2022 Census of Bangladesh, Chittagong Division had 7,528,333 households and a population of 33,202,326, 33.7% of whom lived in urban areas. The population density was 979 people per km2. 90.11% were Muslims, 6.61% Hindus, 2.92% Buddhists, 0.22% Christians and 0.14% others.

<doc id="380458" wikidata="Q4345509" url="?curid=380458" title="Lac repressor">
<text>The &quot;lac&quot; repressor (LacI) is a DNA-binding protein that inhibits the expression of genes coding for proteins involved in the metabolism of lactose in bacteria. These genes are repressed when lactose is not available to the cell, ensuring that the bacterium only invests energy in the production of machinery necessary for uptake and utilization of lactose when lactose is present. When lactose becomes available, it is firstly converted into allolactose by β-Galactosidase (lacZ) in bacteria. The DNA binding ability of &quot;lac&quot; repressor bound with allolactose is inhibited due to allosteric regulation, thereby genes coding for proteins involved in lactose uptake and utilization can be expressed.

== Function ==
The &quot;lac&quot; repressor (LacI) operates by a helix-turn-helix motif in its DNA-binding domain, binding base-specifically to the major groove of the operator region of the &quot;lac&quot; operon, with base contacts also made by residues of symmetry-related alpha helices, the &quot;hinge&quot; helices, which bind deeply in the minor groove. This bound repressor can reduce transcription of the Lac proteins by occluding the RNA polymerase binding site or by prompting DNA looping. When lactose is present, allolactose binds to the &quot;lac&quot; repressor, causing an allosteric change in its shape. In its changed state, the &quot;lac&quot; repressor is unable to bind tightly to its cognate operator. Thus, the gene is mostly off in the absence of inducer and mostly on in the presence of inducer, although the degree of gene expression depends on the number of repressors in the cell and on the repressor&#x27;s DNA-binding affinity. Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is a commonly used allolactose mimic which can be used to induce transcription of genes being regulated by &quot;lac&quot; repressor.

== Structure ==
Structurally, the &quot;lac&quot; repressor protein is a homotetramer. More precisely, the tetramer contains two DNA-binding subunits composed of two monomers each (a dimer of dimers). Each monomer consists of four distinct regions:
*An N-terminal DNA-binding domain (in which two LacI proteins bind a single operator site)
*A regulatory domain (sometimes called the core domain, which binds allolactose, an allosteric effector molecule)
*A linker that connects the DNA-binding domain with the core domain (sometimes called the hinge helix, which is important for allosteric communication)
*A C-terminal tetramerization region (which joins four monomers in an alpha-helix bundle)

DNA binding occurs via an N-terminal helix-turn-helix structural motif and is targeted to one of several operator DNA sequences (known as O1, O2 and O3). The O1 operator sequence slightly overlaps with the promoter, which increases the affinity of RNA polymerase for the promoter sequence such that it cannot enter elongation and remains in abortive initiation. Additionally, because each tetramer contains two DNA-binding subunits, binding of multiple operator sequences by a single tetramer induces DNA looping.

Each monomer has 360 amino acids, so it has 1440 amino acids in total, and 154,520 Dalton of atomic mass.

== Kinetics of DNA binding and unbinding ==
LacI finds its target operator DNA surprisingly fast. &quot;In vitro&quot; the search is 10-100 times faster than the theoretical upper limit for two particles searching for each other via diffusion in three dimensions (3D). To explain the fast search, it was hypothesized that LacI and other transcription factors (TFs) find their binding sites by facilitated diffusion, a combination of free diffusion in 3D and 1D-sliding on the DNA. During sliding the repressor is in contact with the DNA helix, sliding around and tracking its major groove, which speeds up the search process by extending the target length when the TF slides in onto the operator from the side. &quot;In vivo&quot; single-molecule experiments with &quot;E. coli&quot; cells have now tested and verified the facilitated diffusion model, and shown that the TF scans on average 45 bp during each sliding event, before the TF detaches spontaneously and resumes exploring the genome in 3D. These experiments also suggest that LacI slides over the O1 operator several times before binding, meaning that different DNA sequences can have different probabilities to be recognized at each encounter with the TF. This implies a trade-off between fast search on nonspecific sequences and binding to specific sequences. &quot;In vivo&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot; experiments have shown that it is this probability to recognize the operator that changes with DNA sequence, while the time the TF remains in the bound conformation on the operator changes less with sequence. The TF often leaves the sequence it is intended to regulate, but at a strong target site, it almost always make a very short journey before finding the way back again. On the macroscopic scale, this looks like a stable interaction. This binding mechanism explains how DNA binding proteins manage to quickly search through the genome of the cell without getting stuck too long at sequences that resemble the true target.

An all-atom molecular dynamics simulation suggests that the transcription factor encounters a barrier of 1 &quot;kBT&quot; during sliding and 12 &quot;kBT&quot; for dissociation, implying that the repressor will slide over 8 bp on average before dissociating. The &quot;in vivo&quot; search model for the &quot;lac&quot; repressor includes intersegment transfer and hopping as well as crowding by other proteins which make the genome in &quot;E. coli&quot; cells less accessible for the repressor. The existence of hopping, where the protein slips out of the major groove of DNA to land in another nearby groove along the DNA chain, has been proven more directly in vitro, where the &quot;lac&quot; repressor has been observed to bypass operators, flip orientation, and rotate with a longer pitch than the 10.5 bp period of DNA while moving along it.

==Discovery==
The &quot;lac&quot; repressor was first isolated by Walter Gilbert and Benno Müller-Hill in 1966. They showed that &quot;in vitro&quot; the protein bound to DNA containing the &quot;lac&quot; operon, and it released the DNA when IPTG (an analog of allolactose) was added.

<doc id="380462" wikidata="Q781399" url="?curid=380462" title="Australian Film Institute">
<text>The Australian Film Institute (AFI) was founded in 1958 as a non-profit organisation devoted to developing an active film culture in Australia and fostering engagement between the general public and the Australian film industry. It is responsible for producing Australia&#x27;s premier annual film and television awards, the AACTA Awards (previously the AFI Awards).

==Overview==
The work of the institute is supported by government funding, corporate sponsors and approximately 10,000 members nationally. As Australia&#x27;s foremost motion picture industry association, AFI promotes the Australian film and television industry and plays a central role in the way in which the Australian film industry is known and understood, both locally and internationally.

In the 1970s, the AFI played a prominent part in reviving the Australian film industry and in convincing the government to invest in the creation of the Experimental Film Fund, a film school, and a corporation for advancing feature film production. The year 1976 marked the first time that the AFI Awards, which had been given since 1958, were televised. Ten years later, television categories were added to the awards.

A recent focus of the organisation has been on helping to develop the careers of Australian film artists, through the AFI Fellowship and AFI Documentary Trailbrazer programs, as well as with the AFI Young Film Actor Award.

The AFI is affiliated with the Los Angeles Australian Film &amp; Television Association. In August 2011, AFI formed a subsidiary professional organisation, the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts.

==AFI Research Collection==
The AFI Research Collection is a significant non-lending, specialist film and television industry resource. The collection operates under the auspices of Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology&#x27;s School of Media and Communication in conjunction with the Australian Film Institute. The collection has particular strengths in screen history and theory and in Australian cinema, and features a diverse range of books, journals, film scripts, film directories, reports and film festival catalogues.

<doc id="380463" wikidata="Q1860052" url="?curid=380463" title="Calvert, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Calvert is a village in Buckinghamshire, England, near the village of Steeple Claydon.

Originally named after a wealthy local family who had inherited property at Claydon House, Middle Claydon, on condition that they changed their surname to Verney, the village was founded as a hamlet in the Victorian era to house workers for the brick works that were constructed in the area. The Calvert Brickworks was opened in 1900 by Arthur Werner Itter, a brickmaker from the Peterborough area, but have since been closed in 1991 and turned into a nature reserve (Calvert Jubilee) and landfill. All that remains of the hamlet is a small group of red brick terrace houses.

At the start of the 21st century a new housing estate was built called Calvert Green, greatly enlarging the original village. In 2007 Calvert Green was detached from Charndon and formed into a new civil parish. At the 2011 Census the population of the village was still included in the civil parish of Charndon.

==Former claypits==
Three of the former clay pits for the brickworks have become flooded. One is called Grebe Lake, and is used for sailing, boating, angling and kayaking. One is called Itter&#x27;s Pit, and is used for angling, mainly for carp and pike by the Calvert Angling Club, but also contains perch, roach, rudd and catfish. The other pit is a nature reserve for wildfowl.

Another of the clay pits is now a landfill site. Waste is collected from Bristol, Bath and London each day and transported using rail via Aylesbury to Calvert. The site has a power station capable of producing 14 MWe of electricity from landfill gas, coming from the decomposition of organic matter to convert it into renewable electricity MW.

==Railways==
The Buckinghamshire Railway opened its east–west route between Oxford and Bletchley in 1851, passing just north of the village; a route which would later become known as the Varsity Line as it continued to Cambridge. Stations were provided nearby at Claydon and Marsh Gibbon, but not at Calvert. In 1899 the Great Central Railway built its north–south main line to London Marylebone past the village and opened Calvert railway station. British Railways closed Calvert station in 1964.

The east–west Varsity Line continued in operation until 1967 before services were withdrawn and the route mothballed, thereafter seeing only occasional traffic, with the last service operating in 1993. The East West Rail project, announced in 2011, is expected to see the line reopen in 2025, with the closest station at Winslow.

The currently under construction High Speed 2 (HS2) will run along the Great Central Railway north–south corridor in this area, to the east of Calvert. The phase one Infrastructure Maintenance Depot will be located north of Calvert. No passenger interchange between East West Rail and HS2 is proposed, since stopping high speed trains &#x27;too often&#x27; reduces their high speed benefits, although in February 2017, the local MP called for the station to be built at the junction between East West Rail and the HS2 line, serving both lines.

==Trunk roads==
Calvert sits in the strip of land which the Government announced in 2018 as its &#x27;preferred route&#x27; for the new Oxford-Cambridge Expressway road, which would link the A34, M40, and M1 trunk roads. It has been noted that the convergence of HS2, East-West Rail, and the Oxford-Cambridge Expressway at this location would offer opportunities for future provision of a key regional facility, such as an airport, or a New Town

<text>Portland General Electric (PGE) is a &quot;Fortune&quot; 1000, publicly-owned energy company based in Portland, Oregon, that generates, transmits and distributes electricity, serving almost two-thirds of Oregon&#x27;s commercial and industrial activity. PGE is regulated by the Oregon Public Utility Commission. Founded in 1888 as the Willamette Falls Electric Company, the company has been an independent company for most of its existence, though was briefly owned by the Houston-based Enron Corporation from 1997 until 2006, when Enron divested itself of PGE during its bankruptcy.

Notably, PGE does not serve all of Portland. Its service territory comprises most of Portland west of the Willamette River, sharing most of the city east of the river with Pacific Power.

PGE holds a mix of generation and storage facilities including hydropower, wind, solar, battery storage and thermal, as well as key transmission resources. The company&#x27;s power plants have a combined generating capacity of more than 3,300 megawatts.

Following the Oregon House Bill 2021, which introduced new decarbonization goals, PGE announced to reduce emissions from its retail power supply by 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2040.

The utility was founded in 1888 by Parker F. Morey and Edward L. Eastham as Willamette Falls Electric Company. On June 3, 1889, it sent power generated by one of four brush arc light dynamos at Willamette Falls over a electric power transmission line to Portland, the first US power plant to do so.
On August 6, 1892, Morey, Frederick Van Voorhies Holman, and Henry Failing formed the Portland General Electric Company. It was funded by General Electric and the investment arm of Old Colony Trust, with $4.25 million in capital. The newly formed PGE Company purchased Willamette Falls Electric and the Albina Light &amp; Water Company in 1892.

Less than a year later, in May 1893, PGE purchased the City-Eastside Electric Light Plant, a municipal power company. E. Kimbark MacColl, who chronicled the history of Portland, referred to it &quot;a generous gift to a private company at the expense of future taxpayers&quot; since it was constructed for a cost of $40,342 and sold 15 months later for $27,000.

In 1903, Henry W. Goode, the president of PGE, decided to make PGE a &quot;popular public utility.&quot; His vision was for the company to light the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in 1905. in 1903, he traveled to the east coast to raise $3,000 from shareholders. His plan went through, and Thomas H. Wright was put in charge of designing the lighting for the fair.

PGE also purchased the Union Power Company in 1905, and the Vancouver Electric Light &amp; Power Company in 1906. In 1906, PGE, Portland Railway Company, and Oregon Water Power &amp; Railway Company merged, becoming the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company (PRL&amp;P). It was the only streetcar operator within Portland city limits, and the predecessor of the modern PGE.

The company name became Portland Electric Power Company (PEPCO) in 1932. It was reorganized in 1948 as PGE.

On March 1, 1939, PEPCO defaulted on interest bonds that had been issued in March 1934. The bonds were pledged with PGE (the electric subsidiary) and Portland Traction Company (the streetcar subsidiary) as collateral, with Guaranty Trust as trustee. PEPCO filed for Chapter X bankruptcy (now known as Chapter 9) on April 3, 1939, and was assigned District Judge James Alger Fee. The proceedings were later called &quot;one of the most prolonged and complicated series of legal proceedings in Portland&#x27;s history&quot;.

The reorganization and bond default was brought on by PGE&#x27;s difficult negotiations with Bonneville Power Administration, the death of Seattle City Light&#x27;s visionary J. D. Ross, and the indecision created by the possible creation of a public utility district in PGE&#x27;s territory. The Columbia Valley Authority project would have allowed CVA to purchase utilities such as PGE.

PGE survived bankruptcy partially through cheap power purchases from BPA beginning in the fall of 1939, and by the end of 1941 they showed net profits. In the meantime, Ormond R. Bean, the Oregon Public Utility Commissioner, forced PGE to lower its rates. Ultimately, PEPCO and PGE were saved by World War II, which led to the construction of three Kaiser Shipyards and of Vanport City, Oregon to support them. By 1945, PGE derived nearly $400,000 in revenue from the two Kaiser shipyards in Oregon. In August 1946, after the war, they were able to sell Portland Traction for $8 million in cash. Judge Fee ruled the bankruptcy reorganization complete on June 29, 1946.

On July 1, 1997, Enron Corporation bought PGE for $2 billion in stock and $1.1 billion in assumed debt. Then in 1999, and again in 2001, Enron attempted to sell PGE to other investor-owned utilities including Portland-based NW Natural. The corporate officers of PGE claimed that this utility was not involved in the financial mis-dealings of its owner, pointing to the fact that many of its employees suffered when Enron froze the 401(k) retirement plan and were unable to sell the rapidly declining stock. However, Ken Harrison and Joseph Hirko, PGE&#x27;s CEO and CFO respectively at the time of the Enron merger were charged on several felony level counts primarily related to financial misrepresentation regarding Enron Broadband Services which had its headquarters within the World Trade Center complex that comprises PGE&#x27;s corporate offices. In addition Timothy Belden, head of the West Coast Trading Desk and John Forney, an energy trader who invented various electricity trading strategies such as the &quot;Death Star&quot;, operated from the trading floor in the PGE corporate offices and were also convicted of financial crimes related to the California Electricity Crisis.

===Early attempts to convert the company to a public utility district===
Ballot measures have been filed by citizens several times since the 1960s to convert some or all of PGE into a public utility district (PUD), the latest of these being in 2003. Most were unsuccessful, but an exception was in 1999, when PGE announced it was selling its customer base in St. Helens, Scappoose, and Columbia City to West Oregon Electric PUD for $7.9 million. The terms of this sale proposed to leave the physical assets of the distribution system —the poles, wires and other components— owned by Enron, who would then manage this system as a contractor exempt from state regulation. Voter distrust of both Enron and PGE was severe enough for voters to approve the measure, despite $71,592 being spent in advertisements to oppose it, in comparison to the $2,304 spent by supporters. This resulted in those three cities becoming part of the Columbia River PUD on terms far more favorable to the customers; electricity rates immediately dropped in these cities, and remain lower than those for current PGE customers.

===Attempted acquisition by Texas Pacific Group===
Concerned by uncertainty that the Enron bankruptcy would bring, several local governments began investigation into acquiring PGE by condemnation. These studies ended after the announcement on November 17, 2003, that a group called Oregon Electric Utility, led by former governor Neil Goldschmidt and backed by Texas Pacific Group, offered to buy PGE for $2.35 billion. This was the sole bid received by the bankruptcy judge, who approved the bid. When details that Goldschmidt had sexually assaulted a minor in the 1970s emerged, he withdrew from the negotiations, and was replaced by Peter O. Kohler, president of the Oregon Health and Science University.

Discomfort over the Texas Pacific purchase led to further voter initiatives to convert parts of PGE into PUDs. PGE defeated measures in Multnomah County (November 14, 2003), Yamhill County (March 2004), and Clackamas County (May 18, 2004). 
Also during this time period, PGE received notice of a strike by 900 union workers, effective March 8, 2004, represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Points over which the negotiations broke down included retiree medical benefits as well as losses of the members&#x27; 401(k) plan. This labor dispute was resolved shortly afterward, and the union agreed to a new contract.

The TPG purchase offer was denied by the Oregon Public Utility Commission, a three-member regulatory board, on March 10, 2005.
With the rejection of the Texas Pacific Group&#x27;s offer, the City of Portland announced it contacted Enron to resume negotiating an offer to purchase PGE. On April 19, 2005, Portland city officials announced that they were willing to spend $7.5 million in attorneys&#x27; fees to buy the utility. On July 6, the City Council unanimously adopted a measure to finance the acquisition of PGE by the sale of $3 billion in bonds.

However, Enron interim CEO Stephen Cooper called off negotiations on July 20, 2005. He explained that he did not &quot;see a plausible solution under which our teams could reach an agreement that would lead to a transaction closing in a timely fashion&quot;. Cooper addressed several causes for the termination, including the refusal of the city to pay a $50 million deposit on the sale. The same day, Governor Ted Kulongoski vetoed a bill that would create a public corporation to purchase PGE.

===Independence from Enron===
In April 2006, shares in a newly independent PGE were issued as part of an Enron distribution to its creditors.

<doc id="380469" wikidata="Q727621" url="?curid=380469" title="Lawrence Brown (jazz trombonist)">
<text>Lawrence Brown (August 3, 1907 – September 5, 1988) was an American jazz trombonist from California best remembered for his work with the Duke Ellington orchestra. He was a session musician throughout his career, and also recorded albums under his own name.

==Early life==
Lawrence Brown was born on August 3, 1907, in Lawrence, Kansas. When Brown was about six or seven years old in 1914 his family moved to Oakland, California. He began playing the violin at a young age, but quickly grew tired of it and turned to playing the tuba in his school&#x27;s band.

Brown came from a musical background. His father was a preacher at the African Methodist Episcopal Church, where he often sang as a part of his sermons. Brown’s mother played the organ and the piano. Brown discovered the trombone while doing janitorial work at his father’s church. He stated that he wanted to replicate the sound of cello on a trombone.

== Career ==
Brown began his career with Charlie Echols and Paul Howard. In 1932, Brown joined Duke Ellington&#x27;s band. His great technical command of the instrument, with its &quot;creamy tone, neurotic vibrato and range&quot; was featured with Ellington&#x27;s band every year in compositions such as &quot;Blue Cellophane&quot; and &quot;Golden Cress.&quot;

He left Ellington&#x27;s band in 1951 to join a band led by former Ellington sideman Johnny Hodges, where he stayed until 1955. After leaving Hodges, Brown took a position for five years with CBS as a session player. In 1960, he rejoined Ellington and stayed with him until 1970. After leaving Ellington&#x27;s band the second time at the age of 63, Brown stopped performing.

He fulfilled many roles in the Ellington Orchestra—as a balladeer, technical soloist, and section leader. His highly melodic ballad playing as well as his fast technical style inspired trombonists from Tommy Dorsey to Bill Harris.

== Personal life ==
Brown was married to Dorothea Bundrant and actress Fredi Washington. He died in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 81.

<text>Markland () is the name given to one of three lands on North America&#x27;s Atlantic shore discovered by Leif Eriksson around 1000 AD. It was located south of Helluland and north of Vinland.

Although it was never recorded to be settled by Norsemen, there were probably a number of later expeditions from Greenland to gather timber. A 1347 Icelandic document records that a ship went off course and ended up in Iceland in the process of returning from Markland, without further specifying where Markland was.

==Location==
Markland has been suggested to have been part of the Labrador coast in Canada, as Labrador lies in the heavily forested taiga region of the Northern Hemisphere north of the location of Vinland on the island of Newfoundland. The area of Cape Porcupine has been suggested as a possible candidate for the site. The climate and the vegetation in this region may have changed significantly since the sagas were conceived, owing to the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age.

The particular part of the Labrador coast is difficult to pinpoint, as Helluland has been placed everywhere from Baffin Island to the northern Labrador coast beyond Groswater Bay to the southern Labrador Coast.

==Sagas==
The &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot; tells that Leif Eriksson set out in 1002 or 1003 to follow the route that was first described by Bjarni Herjólfsson. The first land that Eriksson went to was covered with flat rocks (Old Norse: &quot;hella&quot;) and so he called it &quot;Helluland&quot; (&quot;Land of the Flat Stones)&quot;. Next, Eriksson came to a land that was flat and wooded, with white sandy beaches, which he called &quot;Markland&quot; (&quot;Forest Land&quot;). Eriksson&#x27;s crew cut down trees and took them to Greenland because Greenland has only one small forest and normally relies on driftwood or imports for lumber. The &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot; also tells of 160 men and women who settled in Markland for winter protection led by Thorfinn Karlsefni (&quot;Þorfinnr Karlsefni Þórðarson&quot;), c. 1010.

The &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; indicates that Markland is south of Helluland, north of Vinland off &quot;Kjalarnes&quot;, northwest of an island called Bjarney, and with a country that Karlsefni thinks may be Hvítramannaland somewhere opposite its coast.

== Milanese record ==

The only known mention of Markland in the Middle Ages outside of the Nordic area occurs in a chronicle written by the Milanese friar Galvaneus Fiamma in the first half of the 14th century. This is the only known mention of the New World before Columbus&#x27;s voyage in 1492 outside of Northern Europe.

<doc id="380483" wikidata="Q55407" url="?curid=380483" title="Raj Kapoor">
<text>Raj Kapoor (; born as Shrishti Nath Kapoor; 14 December 1924 2 June 1988; also known as Ranbir Raj Kapoor) was an Indian actor, film director and producer, who worked in Hindi cinema. He is considered one of the greatest and most influential actors and filmmakers in the history of Indian cinema, and has been referred to as &quot;The Greatest Showman of Indian Cinema&quot; and as the &quot;Charlie Chaplin of Indian Cinema&quot;.

Born in Peshawar as the eldest son of Prithviraj Kapoor of the Kapoor family, Raj Kapoor starred in and produced many films for which he received multiple accolades, including three National Film Awards and 11 Filmfare Awards in India. He was inspired by Charlie Chaplin and played characters based on The Tramp in films, such as &quot;Awaara&quot; (1951), &quot;Shree 420&quot; (1955) and &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot; (1970). His performance in &quot;Awaara&quot; was ranked as one of the &quot;Top-Ten Greatest Performances of All Time in World Cinema&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2005. His films &quot;Awaara&quot; (1951) and &quot;Boot Polish&quot; (1954) competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1951 and 1955&#x27;s editions respectively.

His films were global commercial successes in parts of Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Soviet bloc. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1971 for his contributions to the arts. India&#x27;s highest award in cinema, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, was bestowed to him in 1988 by the Government of India.

==Early life and background==
Raj Kapoor was born as Shrishti Nath Kapoor on 14 December 1924 at Kapoor Haveli, a large house then owned by his grandfather in the Qissa Khwani Bazaar neighborhood of Peshawar, British India into a Punjabi Hindu family of the Kapoor clan, who belonged to the Dhai Ghar Khatri community. He had an Arya Samaji upbringing. His parents were Prithviraj Kapoor and Ramsarni Devi Kapoor (&quot;née&quot; Mehra). The Kapoor family hailed originally from Samundri, Samundri Tehsil, Lyallpur District, Punjab Province, British India. He was the eldest of six children in the family. He was the grandson of Dewan Basheshwarnath Kapoor, great-grandson of Dewan Keshavmal Kapoor, and great-great-grandson of Dewan Murli Mal Kapoor, and was part of the famous Kapoor family. His brothers were the late actors Shammi Kapoor and Shashi Kapoor. He also had a sister named Urmila Sial. Two other siblings died in infancy. Kapoor&#x27;s family later on moved from Peshawar to Bombay for residence and for education.

He is the nephew of actor Trilok Kapoor, who is the younger brother of his father. His first cousin was director Vijay Kapoor who was the son of Trilok Kapoor and actor Subbiraj who was his father&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son. His father&#x27;s cousin was film producer Surinder Kapoor, whose children are producer Boney Kapoor and actors Anil Kapoor and Sanjay Kapoor. His father&#x27;s maternal first cousins were actors Kamal Kapoor, Ravindra Kapoor, and Nandkishore Kapoor. Kamal&#x27;s grandson is filmmaker Goldie Behl. His maternal first cousin, Juggal Kishore Mehra, was a singer, whose step-granddaughter, Salma Agha, later became an actress and singer.

As Prithviraj moved from city to city early in his career during the 1930s, the family had to move too. Raj Kapoor attended several different schools like Colonel Brown Cambridge School in Dehradun, St Xavier&#x27;s Collegiate School in Calcutta and Campion School in Bombay.

==Career==

=== Debut and struggle (1947–1948) ===

At the age of ten, Raj Kapoor appeared in a Hindi film for the first time, in 1935 film &quot;Inquilab&quot;.

His big break came with the lead role in 1947 with Kidar Sharma&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Neel Kamal&quot; opposite Begum Para and Madhubala. The film proved to be a semi-hit at the box office, but his other releases, such as &quot;Jail Yatra&quot;, &quot;Dil Ki Rani&quot; and &quot;Chittor Vijay&quot; didn&#x27;t do well. In 1948, he founded his own banner R. K. Films and made his directional debut with the musical drama &quot;Aag&quot; in which he starred alongside Nargis, Premnath and Kamini Kaushal. The film was an average grosser, but received positive reviews from critics.

=== Stardom (1949–1964) ===

The year 1949 changed the trajectory of Kapoor&#x27;s career. His first release &quot;Sunehre Din&quot; flopped commercially, but the next one &quot;Parivartan&quot; emerged a commercially successful venture while his third release, Mehboob Khan&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Andaz&quot; which also had Dilip Kumar and Nargis went on to become highly successful at the box office. This was followed by &quot;Barsaat&quot;, which he also directed and produced. The film went ahead of the former, eventually emerging an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; and highest grossing Indian film of all time, breaking the record of Ashok Kumar starrer &quot;Kismet&quot;. It ran in Kolkata&#x27;s Paradise Cinema for almost two years. The huge box office success of &quot;Andaz&quot; and &quot;Barsaat&quot; made Kapoor one of the leading male stars of the time along with Dilip Kumar and Dev Anand. 

The following year, he solidified his star-status with superhits in &quot;Sargam&quot; and &quot;Dastan&quot; opposite Rehana and the then top actress Suraiya, respectively. Kapoor had only one release in 1951 which was his own directional, the crime drama &quot;Awaara&quot; co-starring Prithviraj Kapoor and Nargis. The film opened to highly positive response from critics as well as the audience and proved to be another major success for the actor. Its soundtrack composed by Shankar–Jaikishan was the best-selling Hindi film music album of the 1950s and became hugely popular in foreign markets as well, especially in the Soviet Union, China, Turkey and Afghanistan. &quot;Awaara&quot; also earned Kapoor a massive fan-following in Soviet Union where the film had approximately 100 million admissions and remains the third-most watched foreign film in the country. In 1952, he reunited with Nargis for psychological drama &quot;Anhonee&quot; and crime noir &quot;Bewafa&quot;. While &quot;Anhonee&quot; was given the verdict of superhit, &quot;Bewafa&quot; which also had Ashok Kumar in the lead could only manage average returns. This was followed by a minor setback, the next year as none of his films, including &quot;Aah&quot; and &quot;Dhoon&quot; worked at the box office.

After having no major appearance in 1954, he made a comeback in 1955 with the comedy drama film &quot;Shree 420&quot;, co-starring Nargis and Nadira. This one too like his previous directional venture &quot;Awara&quot;, opened to massive acclaim and emerged the top-grossing film of the year. Its songs, such as &quot;Mera Joota Hai Japani&quot;, a solo by Mukesh, &quot;Pyar Hua Iqrar Hua&quot;, a duet by Manna Dey and Lata Mangeshkar and &quot;&quot;Mud Mud Ke Na Dekh&quot;, a duet by Dey and Asha Bhosle topped the year-end annual list of Binaca Geetmala and made its soundtrack the fourth best-selling Bollywood album of the 1950s. &quot;Shree 420&quot; was released in the Soviet Union in 1956 and it took 2nd spot at the Soviet box office charts that year. Despite being imported at an unusually high price, it was the most successful foreign film of the year at the Soviet box office, drawing an audience of 35 million viewers. At 3rd National Awards, it won National Award for Second Best Feature Film in Hindi. The following year, he found success in Anant Thakur&#x27;s &quot;Chori Chori&quot; and a setback in Sombhu Mitra&#x27;s &quot;Jagte Raho&quot; (which he also produced). Although underperforming commercially, the latter received acclaim and its Bengali version won Certificate of Merit at the 4th National Film Awards. &quot;Chori Chori&quot; and &quot;Jagte Raho&quot; also proved to be the final film appearances of Nargis opposite Kapoor.

After delivering a moderate fare with &quot;Sharada&quot; in 1957, Kapoor delivered two successful films, the next year - &quot;Phir Subha Hogi&quot; and &quot;Parvarish&quot;, both co-starring Mala Sinha. In 1959, he collaborated with Hrishikesh Mukherjee for the comedy drama film &quot;Anari&quot;, which also had Nutan, Motilal and Lalita Pawar in the lead. The film emerged a major commercial success with trade pundits classifying it as a blockbuster. It also took 1st spot at the box office that year and proved to be a breakthrough for Mukherjee whose last directional &quot;Musafir&quot; received lukewarm response from audience. Music of &quot;Anari&quot; was a chartbuster, especially the song &quot;Kisi Ki Muskurahaton Pe&quot;, a solo by Mukesh which made its soundtrack one of the best-selling Hindi film album of the decade. For his performance in the film, Kapoor won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor.

Kapoor began the 1960s with Radhu Karmakar&#x27;s &quot;Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai&quot; (which he also produced) and Manmohan Desai&#x27;s &quot;Chhalia&quot;. The former did very well at the box office. It won Kapoor several accolades, including National Award for Second Best Feature Film in Hindi, Filmfare Award for Best Film and his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor. On the other hand, &quot;Chhalia&quot; based on Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;White Nights&quot; was a moderate commercial success, but received positive response from critics. From 1961 to 1963, he had only one success in C. V. Sridhar&#x27;s melodrama film &quot;Nazrana&quot; (1961). 

In 1964, Kapoor had two releases, &quot;Dulha Dulhan&quot; opposite Sadhana and his own directional &quot;Sangam&quot;, co-starring Vyjayanthimala and Rajendra Kumar, which was the first Indian film to be exclusively shot abroad on locations including London, Paris and Switzerland and was also among the most expensive film of its time with the longest runtime for an Indian film up to that time. The former proved to be a hit venture, while &quot;Sangam&quot;, which was Kapoor&#x27;s first color film went on to become an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; and the second-highest grossing film of the 1960s behind &quot;Mughal-E-Azam&quot;. Its soundtrack composed by Shankar-Jaikishan was a rage among the masses as well as the best-selling Hindi film album of the 1960s with songs that remain popular till date like &quot;Dost Dost Na Raha&quot;, &quot;Har Dil Jo Pyaar Karega&quot;, &quot;Bol Radha Bol&quot;, &quot;Yeh Mera Prem Patra&quot;.
&quot;Sangam&quot; also proved to be one of the last major hits of Kapoor as a lead.

===Decline, focus on direction and further acting assignments (1965–1988)===

Kapoor lost stardom in the late-1960s as his subsequent releases, such as &quot;Teesri Kasam&quot; (1966), &quot;Diwana&quot; (1967), &quot;Around the World&quot; (1967) and &quot;Sapnon Ka Saudagar&quot; (1968) were commercially unsuccessful.
In 1970, he starred, produced and directed &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot;, which took six years in making. The film had an ensemble cast consisting of Simi Garewal, Kseniya Ryabinkina, Padmini, Manoj Kumar, Dharmendra, Rajendra Kumar and Rishi Kapoor (playing younger version of Kapoor). Upon release, &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot; was heavily panned by critics and proved to be a box office bomb, eventually putting Kapoor into a financial crisis. However, in later years, it attained cult status and is now considered one of his best films with film experts labelling it a &quot;misunderstood masterpiece&quot;. For portraying a kind-hearted clown in the film, Kapoor won BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi).

The following year, Kapoor produced and appeared alongside his son (Randhir Kapoor) and father in &quot;Kal Aaj Aur Kal&quot;. The film proved to be moderately successful and marked Shankar-Jaikishan&#x27;s last collaboration with R.K. Films. In 1973, he decided to launch Rishi to cover-up the losses incurred due to the box office failure of &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot;, in the romantic musical &quot;Bobby&quot;, which paired him opposite debutante Dimple Kapadia. The film opened to thunderous commercial response, both in India as well as overseas and emerged an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; as well as the highest-grossing film of 1973.

In 1975, Kapoor returned to acting with two back-to-back successful films in Randhir Kapoor&#x27;s &quot;Dharam Karam&quot; and Naresh Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Do Jasoos&quot;. In 1978, he returned to the director&#x27;s chair with &quot;Satyam Shivam Sundaram&quot; starring Shashi Kapoor and Zeenat Aman. The film ran into controversies and was accused of promoting &quot;obscenity&quot;, but opened to positive reception from critics as well as audience and earned him a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Director category. In 1980, Kapoor appeared alongside Sanjay Khan and Zeenat Aman in the highly anticipated romantic drama &quot;Abdullah&quot;. Upon release, it did not live up to expectations and underperformed domestically, but was successful overseas due to his popularity in the Soviet Union.

In 1982, Kapoor once again directed his son Rishi in the romantic musical drama &quot;Prem Rog&quot; opposite Padmini Kolhapure. The film marked his return to social themes and emerged commercially successful at the box office as well as the second-highest grossing film of the year. Its soundtrack composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal was also very successful and proved to be one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the decade. The same year, he appeared alongside Shashi in Asit Sen&#x27;s &quot;Vakil Babu&quot;, which marked his final film appearance. In 1985, he directed and produced romance film &quot;Ram Teri Ganga Maili&quot;, which had his youngest son Rajiv Kapoor and the then newcomer Mandakini playing the lead roles. Despite not having any stars, &quot;Ram Teri Ganga Maili&quot; took first spot at the box office that year and proved to be an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; and one of the biggest hits of the 1980s. At the 33rd Filmfare Awards, it won five awards, including Best Film, Best Director for Kapoor and Best Music Director for Ravindra Jain. &quot;Ram Teri Ganga Maili&quot; was Kapoor&#x27;s last work as he died in 1988. Few months before his death, he was working on an Indo-Pak cross-border love story &quot;Henna&quot;, which was later directed and released by Randhir in 1991 and went on to become a major box office success.

==Personal life==
On 12 May 1946, Raj Kapoor married Krishna Malhotra. Krishna was one of nine siblings, and following her marriage, many of them joined the Hindi film industry. Her brothers, Rajendra Nath, Prem Nath and Narendra Nath, later became actors, and her sister Uma is married to actor Prem Chopra.

Raj and Krishna Kapoor had five children: three sons, actors Randhir Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor and Rajiv Kapoor, and two daughters, Ritu Nanda and Rima Jain. Randhir is married to former actress Babita and is the father of actresses Karisma Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor. Rishi&#x27;s widow is actress Neetu Singh and their two children are daughter Riddhima Kapoor, and son, actor Ranbir Kapoor. Raj Kapoor&#x27;s elder daughter, Ritu Nanda, was married to industrialist Rajan Nanda (scion of the family which promoted and controls the Escorts group), and they had two children: daughter Nitasha Nanda and son, Nikhil Nanda, married to Shweta, daughter of actors Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan. Raj Kapoor&#x27;s younger daughter, Rima Jain, is married to investment banker Manoj Jain and is the mother of Armaan Jain and Aadar Jain. 

Both of Kapoor&#x27;s brothers, all three of Kapoor&#x27;s sons, two of Kapoor&#x27;s daughters-in-law, three of Kapoor&#x27;s grandchildren and a great-grandson are all actors in the Hindi film industry. His granddaughters Karisma Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor (daughters of Kapoor&#x27;s eldest son Randhir), and grandson Ranbir Kapoor (son of Kapoor&#x27;s second son Rishi) are the latest Hindi cinema superstars from the Kapoor family, while another of his grandsons, Nikhil Nanda (Kapoor&#x27;s daughter Ritu&#x27;s son), is a noted industrialist. Nikhil&#x27;s son, Agastya Nanda, made his acting debut with &quot;The Archies&quot; in 2023.

Kapoor had a longtime romantic relationship with renowned actress Nargis Dutt during the 1940s and 1950s, despite being a married man, although neither ever publicly admitted to this. The couple starred in several films together, including &quot;Awaara&quot; and &quot;Shree 420&quot;. As Raj would not leave his wife and children, Nargis ended their relationship after &quot;Chori Chori&quot; and married Sunil Dutt with whom she fell in love on the set of &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957). In 2017, his second son Rishi confirmed his father&#x27;s affair in his autobiography &quot;Khullam Khulla&quot;.

Krishna Raj Kapoor died on 1 October 2018. Rajan Nanda, husband of Ritu Nanda, died on 5 August 2018. In January 2020, Ritu Nanda herself died. She was followed three months later by her younger brother Rishi, Kapoor&#x27;s second son, who died in April 2020. Kapoor&#x27;s third and youngest son, Rajiv, died in February 2021.

Dilip Kumar, Mukesh, Shailendra, Hasrat Jaipuri, Dev Anand, Pran, Rajendra Kumar, Manna Dey, Shankar Jaikishan, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and Rajesh Khanna were among Kapoor&#x27;s closest friends from the movie industry.

== Filmography ==
==Death==

===Cause===

Raj Kapoor suffered from asthma in his later years; he died of complications related to the disease in 1988 at the age of 63. He collapsed at the event where he was to receive the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in New Delhi, and was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi for treatment. He was hospitalised for about a month before he succumbed to complications arising from his asthma. At the time of his death, he was working on the movie &quot;Henna&quot; (an Indo-Pakistan based love story). The film was later completed by his sons Randhir Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor and was released in 1991.

=== Memorial at family farm in Pune ===
His and his parents&#x27; samadhi is at their family farm &quot;Rajbaugh&quot;, meaning the &quot;gardens of king&quot;. Located inside the MIT Art Design and Technology University (MIT ADTU), Rajbaugh lies on the banks of Mula-Mutha River in Loni Kalbhor village 30 km east of Pune in Maharashtra. The Kapoor family sold part of 125 acres Rajbaugh to MIT ADTU which built a memorial for the Kapoor family on its campus. The memorial was unveiled in 2014 in the presence of Lata Mangeshkar and Kapoor clan. The Kapoor family memorial has 7 pagodas showing elements of Raj Kapoor&#x27;s movies, a museum or viewing gallery which showcases family photographs and moments from his movie making from 1945 to 1990. Raj Kapoor shot many of his films at this farm, including &quot;Satyam Shivam Sundaram&quot;, &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot;, &quot;Bobby&quot;, and &quot;Prem Rog&quot;. The family bungalow inside the farm has been preserved; the popular song &quot;Hum Tum Ek Kamre Mein Band Ho&quot; was shot inside this bungalow. 

==Artistry and legacy==
Raj Kapoor is often referred as &quot;The Greatest Showman of Indian Cinema&quot; in the Indian media. Film historians and movie buffs speak of him as the &quot;Charlie Chaplin of Indian cinema&quot;, since he often portrayed a tramp-like figure, who, despite adversity, was still cheerful and honest. His movies were popular in large parts of South/Central/Southeast Asia, the former Soviet Union/Bloc, China, the Middle East, and Africa; his movies were global commercial successes.

Siddharth Kak made &quot;Raj Kapoor&quot;, a feature film documentary on the actor in 1987 which was produced by the Government of India&#x27;s Films Division.

A postage stamp, bearing his face, was released by India Post to honour him on 14 December 2001. To honour him, a brass statue of his was unveiled at Walk of the Stars at Bandra Bandstand in Mumbai in March 2012. 
Many of Raj Kapoor&#x27;s movies had a patriotic theme. His films &quot;Aag&quot;, &quot;Shree 420&quot; and &quot;Jis Desh Men Ganga Behti Hai&quot; (In the country where the Ganges flows) celebrated the newly independent India, and encouraged film-goers to be patriots. Raj Kapoor commissioned these famous lyrics for &quot;Mera Joota Hai Japani&quot;, a song from the movie &quot;Shree 420&quot;:

: &quot;Mera joota hai Japani&quot; (My shoes are Japanese)
: &quot;Ye patloon Inglistani&quot; (These trousers are English)
: &quot;Sar pe lal topi Roosi&quot; (The red cap on my head is Russian)
: &quot;Phir bhi dil hai Hindustani&quot; (But still, however, my heart is Indian)
The song is still extremely popular and has been featured in a number of movies since &quot;Shree 420&quot; was released. Indian author Mahasweta Devi stopped the show with her inaugural speech at the 2006 Frankfurt Book Fair when she used these lyrics to express her own heartfelt patriotism and debt to her country.

Kapoor appeared in &quot;Box Office India&quot;″s &quot;Top Actors&quot; list twelve times from 1949 to 1960.

Apart from his success as an actor, Kapoor is also considered one of the most successful directors of Indian cinema, both critically and commercially.

In 2014, Google commemorated his 90th birthday.

Raj Kapoor was a canny judge of filmi music and lyrics. Many of the songs he commissioned are evergreen hits. He introduced the music directors Shankar–Jaikishan and the lyricists Hasrat Jaipuri and Shailendra. He is also remembered for his strong sense of visual style. He used striking visual compositions, elaborate sets, and dramatic lighting to complete the mood set by the music. He introduced the actresses Nimmi, Dimple Kapadia, and Mandakini, as well as launching and reviving the careers of his sons Rishi, Randhir and Rajiv. Famous for making his actresses reveal the body, not very common then in Indian cinema, it was said his &#x27;show-womanship&#x27; matched his showmanship.

Raj Kapoor&#x27;s &quot;Shree 420&quot; (1955) movie&#x27;s Hindi song &quot;Mera Joota Hai Japani&quot; (&quot;My Shoes are Japanese&quot;) was used in opening sequence of 20th Century Studios 2016 movie &quot;Deadpool&quot;, starring Ryan Reynolds.

The 1967 &quot;Song about Yogis&quot; () by Vladimir Vysotsky mentions Raj Kapoor as one of the three best-known symbols of Indian culture in the Soviet Union, along with Shiva and yoga.

In 2022, he was placed in &quot;Outlook India&quot;″s &quot;75 Best Bollywood Actors&quot; list.

== Awards and honors ==

Kapoor had received many awards throughout his career, including 3 National Film Awards, 11 Filmfare Awards and 21 nominations. His films &quot;Awaara&quot; (1951) and &quot;Boot Polish&quot; (1954) were nominated for the at the Cannes Film Festival. His acting in the former was rated as one of the &quot;Top Ten Performances of All Time in World Cinema&quot; by Time magazine. His film &quot;Jagte Raho&quot; (1956) also won the Crystal Globe award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.

The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1971 and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1987 – the highest award for cinematic excellence in India. In 2001, he was honoured with &quot;Best Director of the Millennium&quot; by Stardust Awards. He was named &quot;Showman of the Millennium&quot; by Star Screen Awards in 2002.

In June 2011, Noah Cowan, artistic director of TIFF Bell Lightbox, and Sabbas Joseph, Director, Wizcraft along with members of the Kapoor family came together to pay tribute to the life and work of Indian actor, director, mogul and legend Raj Kapoor, as presented in partnership by TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival), the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA), and the Government of Ontario. In 2011, it was announced that Kapoor will be inducted into the Brampton Walk of Fame in Ontario, Canada.
From December 13 to 15, 2024, a special screening of Raj Kapoor&#x27;s most famous films were held in 40 cities and 135 theaters across India for his 100th Birthday Anniversary celebration.

<text>The Ayala Center is a mixed-use major commercial development operated by Ayala Land located in Barangay San Lorenzo within the Makati Central Business District in Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines. The complex comprises three shopping malls, three department stores, each with its own retail shops, restaurant arcades and cinemas, several hotels, eight residential towers, five office towers, four parking buildings, and leisure amenities such as the Greenbelt Park, Glorietta 3 Park, and the Ayala Museum, showcasing exhibits on Philippine history and art.

The Ayala Center is surrounded by Ayala Avenue, Dela Rosa Street, and Legazpi Street to the north, Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA/C-4) to the east, Arnaiz Avenue to the south, and Paseo de Roxas to the west. The Ayala station of MRT Line 3 serves the area.

==History==

Ayala Center&#x27;s predecessors were the Makati Commercial Center and Greenbelt, originally an open-space park called Greenbelt Junction in the 1970s.

The Makati Commercial Center, built in 1960, consisted of several small arcades (Maranaw Arcade, Makati Arcade, Angela Arcade, Lising&#x27;s Commercial, Mayfair Center, Bricktown, Anson&#x27;s), theaters (Rizal Theater and Quad Cinemas), freestanding retail outlets (including Makati Supermart, Sulo Restaurant, Automat Restaurant, Rustan&#x27;s, Shoe Mart and Mercury Drug), open parks, and hotels (including Manila Garden Hotel and InterContinental Hotel Manila). It was later renamed &quot;The Center Makati&quot; in the 1980s.

On the other hand, Greenbelt evolved from an open-space park known as Greenbelt Junction, which in the 1970s had an aviary and surrounding low-rise structures with dining establishments. Additional developments in the 1980s include the Greenbelt Square, Fair Center, Greenbelt Arcade, a McDonald&#x27;s branch, and Greenbelt Mall, which were later combined to form Greenbelt.

In the 1990s, the Ayalas redeveloped The Center Makati by merging the existing Makati Commercial Center with the Greenbelt complex into a new development and was renamed &quot;Ayala Center&quot; in 1991. Its redevelopment has been ongoing in phases since the late 2000s, which includes the renovation and expansion of Glorietta and Greenbelt malls and replacing old buildings and open parking spaces with new office buildings, residential towers, hotels, and the One Ayala complex, respectively.

<doc id="380487" wikidata="Q386022" url="?curid=380487" title="Band-stop filter">
<text>In signal processing, a band-stop filter or band-rejection filter is a filter that passes most frequencies unaltered, but attenuates those in a specific range to very low levels. It is the inverse of a &quot;band-pass filter&quot;. A notch filter is a band-stop filter with a narrow stopband (high Q factor).

Narrow notch filters (optical) are used in Raman spectroscopy, live sound reproduction (public address systems, or PA systems) and in instrument amplifiers (especially amplifiers or preamplifiers for acoustic instruments such as acoustic guitar, mandolin, bass instrument amplifier, etc.) to reduce or prevent audio feedback, while having little noticeable effect on the rest of the frequency spectrum (electronic or software filters). Other names include &quot;band limit filter&quot;, &quot;T-notch filter&quot;, &quot;band-elimination filter&quot;, and &quot;band-reject filter&quot;.

Typically, the width of the stopband is 1 to 2 decades (that is, the highest frequency attenuated is 10 to 100 times the lowest frequency attenuated). However, in the audio band, a notch filter has high and low frequencies that may be only semitones apart.
From the figure of the frequency response of an ideal band-stop filter, it&#x27;s obvious that the band-stop filter is simply an inverted band-pass filter where they share same definition of bandwidth, pass band, stop band and center frequency. The attenuation should be infinite in the stop band and be zero in the two pass bands for an ideal band-stop filter. 
Band-stop filters are designed by the combination of a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter in a parallel configuration. Overlapping does not occur in the summation of high-pass filter and low-pass filter during the design of band-stop filter. The difference in the starting and ending frequency points causes the two filters to connect effectively without any overlapping. 
== Mathematical description ==
Band-stop filter can be represented as a combination of low-pass and high-pass filters if the bandwidth is wide enough that the two filters do not interact too much. A more general approach is to design as a low-pass prototype filter which can then be transformed into a bandstop. The simple notch filter shown can be directly analysed. The transfer function is,

formula_1

Here formula_2 is zero circular frequency and formula_3 is the pole circular frequency. Zero frequency is the cutoff frequency and formula_3 sets the type of the notch filter: standard notch when formula_5, low-pass notch (formula_6) and high-pass notch (formula_7) filters. formula_8 denotes the Q-factor.

For standard notch filter the formulation can be rewritten as

formula_9

where formula_10 is the central rejected frequency and formula_11 is the width of the rejected band.

== Examples ==

=== In the audio domain ===
;Anti-hum filter
For countries using 60 Hz power lines:
* low frequency: 59 Hz,
* middle frequency: 60 Hz,
* high frequency: 61 Hz.
This means that the filter passes all frequencies, except for the range of 59–61 Hz. This would be used to filter out the mains hum from the 60 Hz power line, though its higher harmonics could still be present.

For countries where power transmission is at 50 Hz, the filter would have a 49–51 Hz range.

=== In the radio-frequency (RF) domain ===
;Non-linearities of power amplifiers
When measuring the non-linearities of power amplifiers, a very narrow notch filter can be very useful to avoid the carrier frequency. Use of the filter may ensure that the maximum input power of a spectrum analyser used to detect spurious content will not be exceeded.

;Wave trap 
A notch filter, usually a simple LC circuit, is used to remove a specific interfering frequency. This is a technique used with radio receivers that are so close to a transmitter that it swamps all other signals. The wave trap is used to remove or greatly reduce the signal from the nearby transmitter.

;Software-defined radio
Most affordable software-defined radios (SDR) on the market today suffer from limited dynamic and operating ranges. In other words, in real-world operating environments, a SDR can easily be saturated by a strong signal. In particular FM broadcast signals are very strong and nearly everywhere. These signals can prevent a SDR from processing other weak signals. FM notch filters are very useful for SDR applications and have increased in their popularity.

=== Optical filtering (wavelength selection) ===

In optics, there are several methods of filtering selected wavelengths from a source or to a detector. They rely on scattering or destructive interference.

==== Filtering by scattering and diffraction ====
A diffraction grating or a dispersive prism may be used to selectively redirect selected wavelengths of light within an optical system. 

In the case of transmission gratings and prisms, polychromatic light that passes through the object will be redirected according to wavelength. A slit may then be used to select wavelengths that are desired. A reflective grating may also be utilized for the same purpose, though in this case light is reflected rather than transmitted. Filters of this design may be high-pass, band-pass, or low-pass, depending on system configuration.

==== Filtering by interference ====

When using optics with real materials, light will be attenuated at various wavelengths through interference with the medium through which the light traversed. In this sense, material selection may be utilized to selectively filter light according to the wavelengths that are minimally attenuated. To some extent, all real optical systems will suffer from this phenomenon.

Alternatively, it is also possible to use an oscillating reflecting surface to cause destructive interference with reflected light along a single optical path. This principle is the basis for a Michelson interferometer.

=== Band-stop smoothing filter ===
Smoothing filter is essential in many fields, such as signal and image processing, computer vision, statistics, stated by Roonizi (2021). Algorithms such as quadratic variation regularization and smoothness priors are the most common way to perform signal denoising. These algorithms are implemented to band-stop smoothing filters and being investigated by Roonizi (2021). A naive band-stop smoothing filter is raised, which is constructed by connecting a high-pass smoothing filter and a low-pass smoothing filter. These two smoothing filter sections are configured in parallel way. Moreover, it was suggested that positive noise correlation promises to obtain the best band-stop smoothing filter.

=== Telecommunications ===
The development of telecommunications applications raises the demand of radio frequency and microwave filters, stated by Haddi (2019). Those filters are commonly used in PA systems (Public Address Systems) and speaker systems to produce audio with great quality. Microwave filters have high flexibility of actualization and low cost. The band-stop filter in the telecommunications field, has a respectable place which it is essential for microwave transceivers. For example, wireless communication systems make use of band-stop filters to achieve the requirement of miniaturization.

=== Microstrip Band-stop Filter ===
Microstrip-line band-stop filter is convenient to implement with low cost and light weight. Hsieh &amp; Wang (2005) stated that, conventional microstrip band-stop filters are made of shunt open-circuited resonators. They usually has the characteristic of having narrow stopband. However, alternating the band-stop filter to have a wide stop band response with specific design can bring huge advantage over the conventional band-stop filters. 

The advantages of the microstrip band-stop filter designed by Hsieh &amp; Wang (2005) is its compact size and easy implementation. This improved band-stop filter with wide stop-band has additional amount of transmission zeros. The purpose of this design is to combine a shunt open-circuited quarter-wavelength resonator with one section of quarter-wavelength frequency-selecting coupling structure, stated by Hsieh &amp; Wang (2005). As a result, a simple structured band-stop filter with easy implementation can bring advantages of lower-order resonators, great stop band performance when compared to conventional microstrip band-stop filters.

<doc id="380490" wikidata="Q4340117" url="?curid=380490" title="Currency bill tracking">
<text>Currency bill tracking is the process of tracking the movements of banknotes, similar to how ornithologists track migrations of birds by ringing them. It is usually facilitated by any one of a number of websites set up for the purpose, which can track currency among the users of that website. A user may register a bill by entering its serial number, and if someone else has already registered the bill, then the &quot;route&quot; of the bill can be displayed.

Some bill tracking sites encourage marking a bill before spending it, whereas others do not. This usually depends on the laws of the country issuing the currency.

The most popular currencies for currency tracking are the euro, the United States dollar (USD), and the Canadian dollar (CAD).

==Background and legal status==
Originally beginning in the United States in the mid-1990s, the phenomenon or hobby of currency tracking quickly spread first to Canada and then beyond. Especially with the Euro bill tracking, trackers have taken on a much more competitive nature and have formed communities within their respective sites. Many successful sites incorporate some sort of social media, either through site specific unique techniques, or through outside popular social media sites. In the Eurozone because multiple countries having adopted the Euro, this easily leads to competition between trackers in different countries; in the United States competition plays out at the state or county level; and in Canada, at the provincial level.

Marking bills in Canada with ink or rubber stamp is not illegal. In the United States, marking bills is illegal if there is intent to render the bill &quot;unfit to be re-issued&quot;; however, this is rarely enforced and only a fine is faced, if convicted. Marking is widespread in both countries. In the Eurozone marking is not universal, and varies by region. The European Central Bank considers the marking of bills (as well as the destruction of them) to be legal and not exclusive to governments.

==Popular currency bill tracking websites==
Some of the most popular websites for bill tracking include the following:

===North America===
* Where&#x27;s George?, started in December 1998.
* Where&#x27;s Willy? for CAD (Canada).

===Europe===
* EuroBillTracker was started on January 1, 2002, to track euro banknotes. It is the largest of the euro tracking sites.
* DoshTracker, launched in 2001 and relaunched in 2012, allows pound sterling banknotes to be tracked around the United Kingdom and abroad

===Oceania===
* The Money Tracker, started in March 2006, tracks Australian dollars and has similar functionality to Where&#x27;s George.

==In popular culture==

The act of tracking a $20 bill was the binding theme between various stories in the film &quot;Twenty Bucks&quot;.

A similar scheme to currency bill tracking – and said to be inspired by it – is BookCrossing, which tracks the movement of secondhand books which are marked and then &quot;released into the wild&quot;.

In one episode of the Czechoslovak comic series &quot;Rychlé šípy&quot;, the boy club releases a marked 1 crown coin and then they track the coin through Czechoslovakia.

<doc id="380491" wikidata="Q5512790" url="?curid=380491" title="Gabriela Women's Party">
<text>The Gabriela Women&#x27;s Party (General Assembly Binding Women for Reform, Integrity, Equality, Leadership and Action), or simply GABRIELA, is a progressive Filipino political party that advocates for women&#x27;s issues and represents Filipino women in the House of Representatives.

The party is separate, although allied, with GABRIELA National Alliance of Filipino Women. GABRIELA, the alliance, is a nationwide network of grassroots organizations, institutions, and programs that address social issues such as human rights, poverty, globalization, militarism, violence, rape culture, health, sex trafficking, censorship and other issues affecting women. The alliance has regional chapters in Metro Manila, Cordillera Administrative Region, and Mindanao; sub-regional chapters in Negros, Panay and Samar, and provincial chapters in Bicol and Cebu. GABRIELA&#x27;s membership includes Filipino women from marginalized sectors of society and works towards their education and empowerment. The organization also engages in counseling services, medical missions, free clinics, and trainings on women&#x27;s health and women&#x27;s rights.

== History ==
GABRIELA, the alliance, was founded in April 1984 after 10,000 women marched in Manila, defying a Marcos decree against demonstrations. GABRIELA was named in honor of Gabriela Silang, a Filipina revolutionary, who led a revolt against Spain in 1763 following her husband&#x27;s assassination. Amidst a backdrop of widespread social inequality and unrest, GABRIELA aimed to synthesize issues of national liberation, poverty and women&#x27;s emancipation. The organization&#x27;s founders pushed for &quot;Third World feminism&quot; which focused on comprehensive social transformation, rather than focusing on individual forms of oppression. GABRIELA&#x27;s advocacy challenges patriarchy, alongside resisting foreign influence and neocolonialism.

== Electoral performance ==
In 2003, the Gabriela Women&#x27;s Party was launched with the help of GABRIELA members and other women&#x27;s and people&#x27;s organizations. In the 2004 election for the House of Representatives the party-list received 464,586 votes (3.6518% of the nationwide vote) and won a seat for first nominee Liza Maza In the 2007 election, the party won two seats in the nationwide party-list vote. The Gabriela Women&#x27;s Party was the only women&#x27;s party to obtain a second term in Congress.

=== Representatives to Congress ===
*13th Congress (2004–2007) - Liza Maza
*14th Congress (2007–2010) - Luzviminda Ilagan, Liza Maza

<doc id="380492" wikidata="Q1777026" url="?curid=380492" title="Woughton (parish)">
<text>Woughton ( ) is a civil parish in south central Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. The parish council uses the term Community Council. 

The parish takes its name from the original ecclesiastic parish of Woughton and the village of Woughton on the Green. It was reduced in size in 2012 when an area in the east of the parish, including the village of Woughton on the Green, became the separate parish of Old Woughton. Despite the &quot;de facto&quot; local use of the unqualified name &quot;Woughton&quot;, the legal name of the parish is still Woughton-on-the-Green.

==Geography and settlements of the parish==
The current boundaries of the parish run from the Netherfield Roundabout (H8/V8), south along the V8 (Marlborough Street) to the roundabout (H9/V8), then west along the Groveway H9 until it reaches the intersection with the A5. It broadly follows the line of the A5 north until it passes underneath Chafron Way H7. It then runs east along the H7 before returning to the Netherfield Roundabout (H8/V8).

The parish comprises the communities of Beanhill, Coffee Hall, Eaglestone, Leadenhall, Netherfield, Peartree Bridge and Tinkers Bridge. Additionally, there are two industrial areas: Bleak Hall and Redmoor.

===Beanhill===
The building of the Beanhill area of Milton Keynes started in 1973/1974 during a strike by brick makers. Hence phase one was constructed with timber frames with corrugated cladding. The later phase two bungalows are brick-built. From the original build, with the exception of the roads Capron and Simnel (which have two-storey houses), the rest of the residential buildings were all bungalows. After construction every new home came with a voucher from the Milton Keynes Development Corporation (MKDC), allowing the new occupants to choose and plant a tree sapling. More recently, more roads and buildings have been slotted in. For example, the land where Bracken House now stands was originally allotments. In 1989. phase three introduced 35 shared ownership homes in the Wheatcroft Close area.

In keeping with the 1970s Milton Keynes culture there were various arts projects within the Beanhill community. Notably the underpass painted in the Wizard of Oz theme, which was between Beanhill and Coffee Hall, at the back of Lammas. &quot;The Toadstools&quot;, created by Sue McFarland, on the field behind Simnel, are still there. In Beanhill&#x27;s very early days there was also a street theatre based there called &quot;The Beanhill Flat Earth Society&quot;. They performed around MK.

Beanhill has local shops, a meeting place, a medical centre, and a first school and a nursery, both called Moorlands, although on different sites.

===Bleak Hall===
This district, next to the West Coast Main Line, is dedicated to light industry, construction industry supply and &#x27;big shed&#x27; retail. The name Bleak Hall derives from a nearby farm. The streets of Bleak Hall are named after characters and places in the book Bleak House by Charles Dickens.

===Coffee Hall===
Coffee Hall consists of council and privately owned housing and a local shopping centre, including a church and a few shops. Coffee Hall also has a primary school and Coffee Tots childcare provision. The parish offices are also based on the estate, behind the shops at the local centre, having moved from Netherfield in 2017. Coffee Hall is located between Leadenhall, Eaglestone, Netherfield and Beanhill. The roads in Coffee Hall are all named after old London coffee houses.

===Eaglestone===
Eaglestone is home to Milton Keynes University Hospital; a small private hospital (BMI Healthcare&#x27;s Saxon Clinic); a large combined school (Falconhurst); and a retirement village. Eaglestone&#x27;s residential area is to the north of the medical campus. It has houses surrounding parks with children&#x27;s playing equipment, outdoor furniture (often used for street parties) and a large area of greenery. Eaglestone has a local shopping centre with various shops.

===Leadenhall===
Leadenhall contains the Woughton Campus of Milton Keynes College, Milton Keynes Academy, St Pauls School, Milton Keynes and Woughton Leisure Centre – including &quot;The Pitz&quot; performance space.

===Netherfield===
Netherfield is a housing estate located on the south side of Standing Way (A421, H8) opposite the University Hospital, it also has a small shopping arcade with various shops.

The estate was largely designed by Dixon, Jones, Gold and Cross around 1971, and is essentially modernist; it comprises several long parallel terraces, designed around the landform so that the roofline remains level: homes towards the top of the slopes are single storey; those at the bottom are three-storey. The choice of prefabricated construction materials was partly a consequence of a shortage of bricks in the UK at the time. Milton Keynes Council has gradually been renovating the estate, adding a pitched roof when funds permit.

===Peartree Bridge===
Peartree Bridge is mainly composed of a crescent of modern terraced housing overlooking the Grand Union canal and backing onto Marlborough Street (the V8 grid road). The area also includes a canal marina and has a small farm (InterAction) that provides workshops for local children including circus camp, pottery and community friendly underpass painting.

===Redmoor===
Redmoor is an industrial district. Notable organisations based there include Post Office Parcels.

===Tinkers Bridge===
Tinkers Bridge is an estate of mainly social housing. It is part of a grid square that also includes Passmore and Woughton Park private housing (that are in Old Woughton parish).

==Woughton Campus==
This area of Woughton, zoned educational, is home to 
* Milton Keynes College, a further education college
* Milton Keynes Academy, a secondary school
* St Paul&#x27;s Catholic School, a secondary school.

==Campaign to divide the original parish==
In 2010, the residents of Woughton on the Green, Woughton Park and Passmore (in the Tinkers Bridge grid square), came together to argue for the parish to be split into two smaller onesone consisting primarily of private housing and the other of public housing. In autumn 2010, the campaign was launched after a group of residents surveyed the three estates and found that over 90% of those who responded supported the proposal. In response, the chairman of the community council accused those in favour of elitism, saying, &#x27;to divide those communities in an artificial way that divides rich from poor is surely against the very spirit of what we are all seeking to do in Milton Keynes&#x27;. In October 2010, Milton Keynes Borough Councillors, in a recorded vote, voted against the proposal to split the parish into two smaller parishes, however a further review was instigated.
In November 2011, Milton Keynes Council changed their decision and instigated the new parish, with the temporary title of Ouzel Valley. Parish elections were held in May 2012 and, at the first meeting of the nine-member parish council, the name of Old Woughton Parish was adopted. The remainder of the original parish retained the original name.

<text>The River Teign is a river in the county of Devon, England. It is long and rises on Dartmoor, becomes an estuary just below Newton Abbot and reaches the English Channel at Teignmouth.

==Toponymy==
The river-name &#x27;Teign&#x27; is first attested in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 739, where it appears as &quot;Teng&quot;. The name is pre-Roman, related to the Welsh &quot;taen&quot; meaning &#x27;sprinkling&#x27;, or &#x27;spread out&#x27; and means simply &#x27;stream&#x27;.

The river lends its name to several places, including Teigncombe, Drewsteignton, Canonteign, Teigngrace, Kingsteignton (at one time, one of England&#x27;s largest villages), Bishopsteignton, Teignharvey, and the second largest settlement along its course, Teignmouth. However, the villages of Combeinteignhead and Stokeinteignhead, on the other side of the estuary from Bishopsteignton, are not named after the river.

==Course==
The River Teign rises on Dartmoor, as do many other major Devonian rivers. It has two separate sources: one rises at Teign Head, forming the North Teign which flows northeast where it is crossed by a clapper bridge near Teigncombe. On its bank near the confluence with the Walla Brook is the Tolmen Stone that is perforated by a large circular hole. The second source rises near Grey Wethers and forms the shorter South Teign which flows through the Fernworthy Forest and a reservoir of the same name. The two rivers combine at Leigh Bridge near Chagford to form the Teign, which leaves the moor on its eastern side, flowing beneath Castle Drogo in a steep-sided valley. Near Dunsford there is a nature reserve on the east bank.

It then flows southwards at the east edge of the moor through a steep-sided valley along which ran the Teign Valley Line providing rail service to the villages in the vicinity until its closure in 1967. Near Trusham the Beadon Brook joins, bringing overspill from the Tottiford, Kennick, and Trenchford Reservoirs.

Passing Chudleigh and Chudleigh Knighton, the river flows through the Bovey Basin where ball clay is extracted, then between Kingsteignton and Newton Abbot, where, during its operation from 1898 to 1974, the Newton Abbot power station drew its cooling water from the river, discharging it back into the River Lemon, which joins the Teign downstream.

Below Newton Abbot the river turns abruptly to the east and becomes tidal, widening to form the Teign Estuary, a large ria that reaches the English Channel at Teignmouth.

==Crossings==
Fingle Bridge is a Grade II* listed structure that crosses the river near Drewsteignton on Dartmoor.

Until 1827 the most downstream bridge was Teign Bridge at Teigngrace. When it was being rebuilt in 1815 it became apparent that at least four successive bridges had been erected at various times with or over the remains of the previous constructions. Mr. P. T. Taylor, who investigated the matter at the time, gave as his opinion that: the last or upper work was done in the sixteenth century, and that the red bridge had been built on the salt marsh in the thirteenth century; since which time there has been an accumulation of soil to the depth of ten feet. He supposes the wooden bridge to be old as the Conquest, and the white stone bridge to have been Roman work.

In 1976 a viaduct was built across the top of the estuary just below Newton Abbot to carry the newly diverted A380 road. The viaduct is about long and has eleven spans.

Since 1827 the lowest road crossing has been Shaldon Bridge that now carries the A379 near the mouth of the estuary. A passenger ferry between Teignmouth and Shaldon operates a little lower down.

==Navigability==
===Ships and barges===
The port of Teignmouth, just inside the mouth of the estuary, is visited by ships mostly handling clay, timber and grain.

The lower reaches of the river are navigable up to Newton Abbot, although now only to shallow draft boats and those less than 2.9 metres high due to the Shaldon Bridge.

The tidal Whitelake Channel of the river connects it to two disused short canals that were both built to serve the ball clay trade in the area. The Stover Canal heads to Teigngrace (with the River Teign also supplying the header pond); it was built to serve ball clay operations, but later it was the terminus of the Haytor Granite Tramway, carrying granite. The second connection was to the Hackney Canal, only 0.6 miles long, that connected the river to a ball clay quarry at Hackney Clay Cellars in Kingsteignton (now the site of a retail park), through what is now Newton Abbot Racecourse.

===Personal watercraft===
The river has been kayaked at least from Leigh Bridge (the confluence of the North and South Teign) at to Steps Bridge at , rated as grade 2 to 3. There is also a single high-grade, very technical drop.

==Fishing==
The Teign estuary is known for flounder fishing; a British record specimen was caught here in 1994. Other species include grey mullet in the estuary, brown trout further up the river and some salmon and sea trout throughout. Some coarse fish are caught in the lower reaches of Teign, although it is not officially a coarse fish river. This includes carp as far as the tidal marshes under the A380 at Newton Abbot.

<text>International School Manila (abbreviation: ISM or IS Manila) is a private, non-profit, non-sectarian international school located in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, Metro Manila, Philippines. Founded in 1920 as the American School by a group of American and British parents living in Manila, it adopted its present name in 1970.
International School Manila is one of six members of the Interscholastic Association of Southeast Asian Schools (IASAS).

==History==
A group of American and British expatriates established the American School, Inc. on June 21, 1920. It was first located at 606 Taft Avenue, a loaned church building in Manila, with eight teachers and fifty students from Grades 1 to 12. It transferred later that year to M.H. Del Pilar Street and in 1922, to Padre Faura Street, both also in Manila. The campus was transferred to Donada Street, Pasay in 1936. It was closed in 1942 during World War II and was reopened by September 1946. The campus was then transferred near Bel-Air, Makati in 1961.

In 1970, the American School was renamed to International School Manila (ISM) at the recommendation of the US Embassy. In the same year, ISM became the first international school to receive accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). In 1982, ISM joined the Interscholastic Association of Southeast Asian Schools (IASAS). By 2002, the school transferred from Makati to its present location in Bonifacio Global City. Century City now occupies the site of the former Makati campus.

==Campus==
The ISM campus sits on a site in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, Metro Manila.

==Organization and leadership==
The ISM is divided into three departments, each having its faculty, administration and principal. The Superintendent heads its overall administration.

==Curriculum==
There are three years of preschool, and twelve years of primary and secondary education. Its K–12 standard is based from the American school system. As a result, it has a different program implementation from the one proposed by the Department of Education.

The curriculum at elementary school is built on inquiry-based learning, which encourages students to become autonomous, creative thinkers. As students proceed through middle and high school, the teaching style switches to subject-based programmes culminating in the IB Diploma. AP courses are available to chosen students in grades 9 and 10. The school constantly reviews the curriculum to ensure it contains the most excellent worldwide practices. An ESL programme is provided for students who speak English as a second language and have below-grade English skills. Learning support instructors aid and guide students in need throughout the school, and a Specialised Learning Support Programme caters to kids with extraordinary needs.
The foreign languages program encompasses Chinese, Filipino, French, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish. Notably, about 60% of graduating students pursue undergraduate studies in the United States.
The school holds recognition from the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports in the Philippines. It boasts accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO).

== Facilities ==
There are numerous sports facilities at the International School Manila. ISM has two artificial football and rugby fields (one 4G standard) on its campus and one small real grass field. There are 8 rooftop-covered tennis courts, a 10-line climbing wall, four sports gymnasiums (HS, MS, ES and PS), a gymnastics floor, three swimming pools, a martial arts room (Aikido, Taekwondo), a fitness suite and a weights and cardio facility. ISM plays within the IASAS competition within the three seasons of HS sport. A Digital Golf Center is currently being planned, with the area already constructed.

==Notable alumni==

<doc id="380497" wikidata="Q657848" url="?curid=380497" title="Charles Follen McKim">
<text>Charles Follen McKim (August 24, 1847 – September 14, 1909) was an American Beaux-Arts architect of the late 19th century. Along with William Rutherford Mead and Stanford White, he provided the architectural expertise as a member of the partnership McKim, Mead &amp; White.

==Life and career==
McKim was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania. His parents were James Miller McKim, a Presbyterian minister, and Sarah Speakman McKim. They were active abolitionists and he was named after Charles Follen, another abolitionist and a Unitarian minister. After attending Harvard University, he studied architecture at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris before joining the office of Henry Hobson Richardson in 1870. McKim formed his own firm in partnership with William Rutherford Mead, joined in 1877 by fellow Richardson protégé Stanford White.

For ten years, the firm became primarily known for their open-plan informal summer houses. McKim became best known as an exponent of Beaux-Arts architecture in styles of the American Renaissance, exemplified by the Boston Public Library (1888–95), and several works in New York City, including the Morningside Heights campus of Columbia University (1893), the University Club of New York clubhouse (1899), the Pierpont Morgan Library (1903), New York Penn Station (1904–10), and The Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, Ohio (1919). He designed the Howard Mansion (1896) at Hyde Park, New York.

McKim, with the aid of Richard Morris Hunt, was instrumental in the formation of the American School of Architecture in Rome in 1894, which has become the American Academy in Rome, and designed the main campus buildings with his firm McKim, Mead, and White.

McKim first married Annie Bigelow in 1874, and after divorcing Bigelow, married Julia Amory Appleton in 1885.

McKim died at age 62 in St. James, New York on September 14, 1909.

===Memberships===
McKim was a member of the Congressional commission for the improvement of the Washington, D.C., park system, the New York Art Commission, the Accademia di San Luca (Rome, 1899), the American Academy in Rome and the Architectural League. He was an honorary member and former president of the American Institute of Architects, and honorary member of the Society of Mural Painters. He became a National Academician in 1907. He belonged to the university, Lambs, and Racquet and Tennis Clubs of New York, and to the St. Botolph and Somerset Clubs of Boston.

==Awards and honors==
McKim received numerous awards during his lifetime, including the Medaille d&#x27;Or at the 1900 Paris Exposition and a gold medal from Edward VII of the United Kingdom. The royal gold medal from Edward VII was awarded for the restoration of the White House. In 1902 Congress appropriated $475,445 for this purpose to be spent at the discretion of President Theodore Roosevelt. He received honorary doctorates from the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University, and the honorary degree of A.M. from Harvard in 1890, and from Bowdoin in 1894.
He was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1877, and received the AIA Gold Medal, posthumously, in 1909.
