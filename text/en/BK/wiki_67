<text>Charles Joseph Scarborough (; born April 9, 1963) is an American television host and former politician who is the co-host of &quot;Morning Joe&quot; on MSNBC with his wife Mika Brzezinski and Willie Geist. He previously hosted &quot;Scarborough Country&quot; on the same network. A former member of the Republican Party, Scarborough was in the United States House of Representatives for Florida&#x27;s 1st district from 1995 to 2001. He was appointed to the President&#x27;s Council on the 21st Century Workforce in 2002 and was a visiting fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. He was named in the 2011 &quot;Time&quot; 100 as one of the most influential people in the world.

==Early life and education==
Scarborough was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1963, the son of Mary Joanna (&quot;née&quot; Clark) and George Francis Scarborough, a businessman. He has two siblings. In 1969, his family moved to Meridian, Mississippi, in 1973 to Elmira, New York, and in 1978 to Pensacola, Florida. Scarborough attended Pensacola Catholic High School in Pensacola. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from the University of Alabama in 1985 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Florida College of Law in 1990. During this time, he wrote music and produced CDs with his band, Dixon Mills, including the album &quot;Calling on Robert E. Lee&quot;, and he also coached football and taught high school. During his first year of law school, Scarborough wrote a musical about televangelists called &quot;The Gospel According to Esther&quot; which premiered at the University of Alabama to positive reviews. Later, the musical was showcased at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival.

==Legal career==
Scarborough was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1991 and practiced law in Pensacola.

Scarborough&#x27;s most high-profile case was briefly representing Michael F. Griffin, who murdered Dr. David Gunn in 1993. Griffin&#x27;s father was a friend of Scarborough&#x27;s in-laws, and Joe agreed to represent Griffin until the murder suspect found adequate representation. Before removing himself from the case, Scarborough made several court appearances representing Griffin, later saying: &quot;There was no way in hell I could sit in at a civil trial, let alone a capital trial,&quot; referring to the prospect of prosecutors seeking the death penalty against Griffin. Scarborough assisted Griffin in choosing other counsel from the many who offered their services, however, and helped shield the family from the media exposure, &quot;pro bono&quot;.

Scarborough&#x27;s political profile was also raised when he assisted with a petition drive in late-1993, leading a tax revolt that defeated a proposed sixty-five percent increase in Pensacola&#x27;s property taxes.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
=== Elections ===

In 1994, Scarborough was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for Florida&#x27;s 1st congressional district, becoming the first Republican to represent the Florida Panhandle since Reconstruction. The seat had become open when eight-term Democratic incumbent Earl Hutto retired. In the general election, Scarborough defeated the Democratic candidate, Pensacola attorney Vince &quot;Vinnie&quot; Whibbs, Jr., with 61 percent of the vote. Whibbs was the son of former Pensacola mayor Vince Whibbs. This district had not supported a Democratic candidate for U.S. president since 1960; however, Democratic candidates had continued to hold most local offices well into the 1990s. Scarborough&#x27;s win coincided with a large Republican wave that allowed the Republicans to take the majority in the House for the first time in 40 years.

Scarborough was reelected with 72 percent of the vote in 1996. In 1998 and 2000, he faced only write-in candidates as opposition.

=== Tenure ===
In June 2000, during his congressional career, he received a 95 percent lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union. He signed the Contract with America. Scarborough was a member of the Armed Services, Judiciary, Government Reform, and Education committees. In 1998 he was named chairman of the Civil Service Committee.

Scarborough was one of a group of about 40 freshmen Republican legislators who dubbed themselves the &quot;New Federalists&quot; after &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;. Scarborough was elected political director of the incoming legislators. The New Federalists called for sweeping cuts in the U.S. government, including plans to &quot;privatize, localize, consolidate, [or] eliminate&quot; the Departments of Commerce, Education, Energy and Housing and Urban Development. House Speaker Newt Gingrich tapped Scarborough to head a Republican task force on education, and Scarborough declared, &quot;Our goal is to get as much money, power, and authority out of Washington and get as much money, power, and authority into the classroom as possible.&quot; Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), then chairman of the House Budget Committee, adopted Scarborough&#x27;s language eliminating the federal Department of Education in the 1996 House Budget Resolution. The budget passed the House by a vote of 238–193. Scarborough and the group played a pivotal role in pressing Gingrich to keep the GOP&#x27;s promise to balance the federal budget.

Scarborough supported a number of anti-abortion positions while in Congress including banning family planning funding in US aid abroad; banning partial-birth abortions; and making it illegal to transport minors to get an abortion. He voted in favor of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, that made it a crime to harm a fetus during the commission of other crimes.

Scarborough sponsored a bill to force the U.S. to withdraw from the United Nations after a four-year transition and replace it with an international organization of democratic nations. He voted to make the Corporation for Public Broadcasting self-sufficient by eliminating federal funding. He also voted for the &quot;Medicare Preservation act of 1995,&quot; which cut the projected growth of Medicare by $270 billion over ten years. Scarborough was one of few house Republicans to vote against efforts by Gingrich to cut Medicaid funding and the only Republican in the Florida delegation to vote against oil drilling royalty relief, which Scarborough blasted as &quot;corporate welfare&quot;. He voted against the &quot;Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996,&quot; which raised the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour. Scarborough had a conservative voting record on economic, social, and foreign policy issues but was seen as moderate on environmental issues and human rights causes, including supporting the closure of the School of the Americas and defending accused terrorist Lori Berenson. Scarborough also teamed up with civil rights leaders in a controversial effort to rename a historic Pensacola street after Martin Luther King, Jr. The Pensacola News Journal praised Scarborough’s leadership despite these efforts not being of political benefit to him.

While in Congress, Scarborough received several awards, including the &quot;Friend of the Taxpayer Award&quot; from Americans for Tax Reform; the &quot;Guardian of Small Business Award&quot; from the National Federation of Independent Business; the &quot;Spirit of Enterprise Award&quot; from the United States Chamber of Commerce; the &quot;Taxpayer&#x27;s Hero Award&quot; from the Citizens Against Government Waste; and the &quot;Guardian of Seniors&#x27; Rights Award&quot; from the 60 Plus Association. In 1996, Scarborough spoke at the John Birch Society’s Council Dinner in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles.

Scarborough was one of the 228 members of the House who voted to impeach Bill Clinton in December 1998.

===Electoral history===
===Resignation===
In May 2001, five months into his fourth term in Congress, Scarborough stated his intention to resign to spend more time with his children. Of his resignation, Scarborough said, &quot;The realization has come home to me that they&#x27;re at a critical stage of their lives and I would rather be judged at the end of my life as a father than as a congressman.&quot; A special election was held in October 2001 to replace Scarborough. Since then, Scarborough has contemplated returning to politics several times. In 2017, Scarborough left the Republican Party to become an independent.

==Media career==
In 1999, while still serving in Congress, Scarborough founded the free weekly Pensacola-area newspaper &quot;The Florida Sun&quot;. The paper merged in 2001 and is now known as the &quot;Independent News&quot;.

After leaving Congress, Scarborough worked as an environmental lawyer in Florida.

=== &quot;Scarborough Country&quot; ===
In April 2003, &quot;Scarborough Country&quot; debuted as a nightly primetime show on MSNBC.

In 2005 the program covered politics and popular culture. Scarborough broadcast the show from Biloxi, MS, during the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. After three days of reporting on the scenes, Scarborough called the situation in the Gulf Coast region &quot;nothing short of a national disgrace&quot;. &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; wrote that Scarborough’s experiences “put him on the shortlist of network anchors and correspondents for whom Gulf Coast assignments during and immediately after Katrina proved life-changing.” Because of Scarborough&#x27;s criticism of President Bush, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said his Katrina coverage had &quot;become essential viewing.&quot; Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley wrote in his book on Katrina, &quot;The Great Deluge&quot;, that “Joe Scarborough was keenly attuned to the devastation along the Gulf Coast...and his diagnosis of the failures was right on the mark.&quot;

===Radio===
On December 8, 2008, Scarborough and &quot;Morning Joe&quot; co-host Mika Brzezinski began hosting a two-hour late-morning radio show on WABC (770 AM) in New York City, replacing 12-year veteran host John Gambling. On April 26, 2010, the radio show was placed on &quot;hiatus&quot;, which Scarborough said was to redevelop its format into a new three-hour show. The show never returned.

===&quot;Morning Joe&quot;===

In May 2007, Scarborough became one of the rotating hosts auditioning for the slot vacated by &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; on MSNBC. With his morning show, Scarborough won the slot permanently in July 2007.

&quot;Morning Joe&quot; is a weekday MSNBC news and talk show from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. Eastern Time. It features Joe Scarborough providing both enterprise reporting and discussion on the news of the day in a panel format with co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Willie Geist. The show features in-depth discussions that help drive the day&#x27;s political conversation. The initial reviews were positive. The &quot;New York Times&quot; said it was &quot;unlike anything else on morning television&quot; and &quot;American Journalism Review&quot; said the show &quot;set the agenda for the day&#x27;s news&quot;.

In 2007, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg joined Geist, Brzezinski, MSNBC president Phil Griffin, and Scarborough to cut the ribbon on the new set of &quot;Morning Joe&quot; at 30 Rock.

The program became a Washington &quot;breakfast staple&quot;, showing up on screens at the congressional gym and on government jets. Scarborough has covered presidential elections and conventions. 

According to Nielsen ratings in 2016, &quot;Morning Joe&quot; delivered MSNBC&#x27;s biggest ever total viewer and demo audiences for that time period and beat third-place CNN in both categories. This marked &quot;Morning Joe&quot;″s seventh straight year topping CNN in total viewers. Scarborough also hosts &quot;Joe Scarborough Presents&quot; a primetime special dedicated to a single topic. The 2023 premiere featured Joe Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Tony Blair. He has appeared on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, and &quot;Late Night With Seth Meyers&quot;.” He is a regular guest on NBC and MSNBC news programs such as &quot;PoliticsNation with Al Sharpton&quot; and &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. Joe also appeared as himself on two episodes &quot;of Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; in 2024.

In 2023, Morning Joe was the #1 cable morning show in New York and Washington, DC. Nationally, Morning Joe ranked #2 in all of cable television in its time slot for the 7th straight year. Morning Joe beat CNN in the ratings for the 14th straight year in total audience and in the Nielson A25-54 demographic group for the 8th straight year. Compared to the previous year, Morning Joe had double-digit viewership growth among total viewers and adults ages 25–54, while CNN This Morning and FOX &amp; Friends had double-digit declines. In August 2023, Adweek reported Morning Joe was the most-watched morning cable news program.

== Feud with Donald Trump ==
In an op-ed for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in August 2016, Scarborough argued that the Republican Party must &quot;dump Donald Trump&quot; as their presidential candidate. Drawing attention to Trump&#x27;s remarks about Hillary Clinton and the Second Amendment, Scarborough wrote: &quot;A bloody line has been crossed that cannot be ignored. At long last, Donald Trump has left the Republican Party few options but to act decisively and get this political train wreck off the tracks before something terrible happens.&quot;

In June 2017, Scarborough and Brzezinski were the targets of tweets by President Trump that, in response to their coverage of his administration, referred to Scarborough as &quot;Psycho Joe&quot; and called Brzezinski &quot;low I.Q. Crazy Mika,&quot; while asserting that she was &quot;bleeding badly from a face-lift&quot; when he previously encountered her at Mar-a-Lago. The hosts responded with an op-ed in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, in which they described White House officials telling them that the president would kill a pending &quot;National Enquirer&quot; article if they apologized to Trump for their coverage of him.  The president&#x27;s tweets received criticism from many Republican lawmakers, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Senators John McCain, Susan Collins, Ben Sasse, Lindsey Graham, and Lisa Murkowski.

Trump has also aired &quot;wild allegations and fact-free innuendo&quot; stemming from an incident from Scarborough&#x27;s time in Congress. On July 20, 2001, while Scarborough was in Washington, D.C., one of his aides, 28 years old, Lori Bolterstein Klausutis, was found dead on the floor of his congressional office in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. An autopsy determined that an undiagnosed heart-valve irregularity had caused the 28-year-old to lose consciousness, fall, and hit her head on the edge of a desk the day before. Media trafficked in speculation about the death, often connecting it with Scarborough&#x27;s resignation from Congress, announced in May. The claim that Scarborough was involved in the death was promoted by publisher Markos Moulitsas. Since 2017, Trump has resurrected the debunked rumor and has called for another investigation. The &quot;Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and Washington Examiner&quot; have condemned Trump&#x27;s remarks. &quot;It&#x27;s remarkable that we have a president who is trying to have someone prosecute the person he considers to be his chief critic in the media,&quot; Scarborough responded in 2020. &quot;That&#x27;s what Putin does. That&#x27;s what Orban does. That&#x27;s what autocrats have been doing for centuries.&quot; In May 2020, the aide&#x27;s widower wrote a letter to Twitter&#x27;s chief executive Jack Dorsey begging him to delete Trump&#x27;s tweets saying &quot;President Trump on Tuesday tweeted to his nearly 80 million followers alluding to the repeatedly debunked falsehood that my wife was murdered by her boss, former U.S. Rep. Joe Scarborough. The son of the president followed and more directly attacked my wife by tweeting to his followers as the means of spreading this vicious lie.&quot; Kara Swisher followed up with an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on May 26, 2020, calling on Twitter to hold Trump to the company&#x27;s rules. That same day, Twitter began fact-checking Trump&#x27;s posts and applying warnings to his tweets when they made misleading claims about mail-in voting.

In November 2024, following the 2024 United States presidential election, Mika and Joe met with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.

== Public opinions ==
In August 2019, Scarborough drew criticism after posting conspiracy-driven tweets about the death of Jeffrey Epstein, an American financier multimillionaire and convicted sex offender. Scarborough tweeted: &quot;A guy who had information that would have destroyed rich and powerful men&#x27;s lives ends up dead in his jail cell. How predictably... Russian.&quot;

In January 2021, Scarborough excoriated the Capitol Hill Police for having enabled the attack at the U.S. Capitol by Donald Trump supporters. He claimed a double standard that had the perpetrators been either black or Muslim, they likely would have been dealt with more harshly.

== Books ==
Scarborough released his first book, &quot;Rome Wasn&#x27;t Burnt in a Day: the Real Deal on how Politicians, Bureaucrats, and other Washington Barbarians are Bankrupting America,&quot; on October 4, 2005.

In his second book, &quot;The Last Best Hope&quot;, released on June 9, 2009, Scarborough outlined a plan to help guide conservatives back to a political majority after their defeats in the 2006 midterm elections and the 2008 presidential election.

On November 12, 2013, Scarborough released his third book, &quot;The Right Path: From Ike to Reagan, How Republicans Once Mastered Politics—and Can Again&quot;.

On November 24, 2020, Scarborough released his fourth book, &quot;Saving Freedom: Truman, the Cold War, and the Fight for Western Civilization&quot;.

== Music ==
Scarborough released his debut EP, &quot;Mystified&quot;, on June 23, 2017. A video for the title track of the new wave-inspired EP was also released on the same day. Scarborough said he planned to release a new EP every month for the following four years.

== Influence ==
Scarborough was named on the 2011 TIME 100 list of the world’s most influential people. TIME noted his fearless approach to speaking his mind &quot;without fear or favor&quot; and his dedication to placing &quot;country before party&quot; making him an essential voice in American politics.

Alongside Mika Brzezinski, in 2012 Scarborough was named on &quot;Vanity Fair’s&quot; “Top Media Power Players” list.

In 2015, he interviewed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and abruptly ended the interview, but resumed it after the commercial break. Having known Scarborough for years, Trump would often call into the show during his first presidential campaign. It was also reported that during his term as President, Joe Biden called Scarborough often to get the host’s take on issues, as &quot;Morning Joe&quot; was Biden’s favorite program, and it influenced who he listened to and how the White House was run.

The Monday after the attempted assassination of Trump, &quot;MSNBC&quot; preempted &quot;Morning Joe&quot; for the day, prompting threats from Scarborough to quit if the network took similar action again. &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; reported that the message of the show was “We&#x27;re back—and the place to go for powerful Democrats to make their case” because in the days following Biden’s endorsement of Vice President Harris for President, Scarborough and others on the show interviewed VP nominee hopefuls Governors Roy Cooper, Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that “at a time when TV news feels like it is fading into irrelevance with the broader public, with a certain group of extremely important and influential viewers (or even one viewer in particular), it appears to be more essential than ever.”

In 2022, Scarborough, Brzezinski, and Willie Geist were named &quot;Mediaite’s&quot; Most Influential in News Media, with &quot;Mediaite&quot; praising Morning Joe’s “remarkable broadcasting prowess and chemistry.” 

In 2023, Mediaite recognized the Morning Joe team as the &quot;clear favorite for liberal viewers and inside-the-Beltway audiences,&quot; noting Joe Scarborough&#x27;s role as the &quot;leading man,&quot; delivering daily insights into the political zeitgeist with sharp analysis and energy.

In 2024, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski were honored as Mediaite’s Most Influential in News Media, celebrated for being among the year’s &quot;biggest stars in all of media.&quot; Their show was the most closely tracked program leading up to the presidential election, with viewers recognizing the significant bipartisan influence the hosts wield across the political spectrum.

== Awards and honors ==
* In 2016, Scarborough was inducted into the Cable Hall of Fame with Mika Brzezinski.
* In 2017, Harvard awarded Scarborough and Brzezinski a Visiting Fellowship at Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s Institute of Politics.
* Scarborough was honored with Brzezinski in 2018 with the Radio Television Digital News Foundation&#x27;s Leonard Zeidenberg First Amendment Award for a major contribution to the protection of First Amendment freedoms.

==Personal life==
Scarborough has been married three times. In 1986, Scarborough married Melanie Hinton. The couple had two sons and divorced in 1999. While interviewing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on June 21, 2005, Scarborough expressed concerns about the possibility that one of his sons may have suffered vaccine damage (see Thimerosal controversy). Scarborough said, &quot;My son, born in 1991, has a slight form of autism called Asperger&#x27;s. When I was practicing law and also when I was in Congress, parents would constantly come to me, and they would bring me videotapes of their children, and they were all around the age of my son or younger. So, something happened in 1989.&quot;

In October 2001, Scarborough married his second wife, Susan Waren, a former aide to Florida governor Jeb Bush and a former congressional committee staffer. Their daughter was born in August 2003; their son was born in May 2008. Scarborough and Waren were divorced in January 2013.

, Scarborough has residences in both New Canaan, Connecticut, an affluent exurb of New York City, and Jupiter, Florida. In early 2017, during a trip to Antibes, France, Scarborough became engaged to his co-host Mika Brzezinski. The couple married on November 24, 2018, in Washington, D.C., in a ceremony officiated by U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings.

Scarborough is not related to WNBC-TV anchor Charles Bishop &quot;Chuck&quot; Scarborough III.

<doc id="386262" wikidata="Q370709" url="?curid=386262" title="Peace of Callias">
<text>The Peace of Callias is a purported peace treaty that supposedly was established around 449 BCE between the Delian League (led by Athens) and the Achaemenid Empire and ended the Greco-Persian Wars. The peace would then be the first compromise treaty between Achaemenid Persia and a Greek city.

The peace was negotiated by Callias, an Athenian politician. Persia had continually lost territory to the Greeks after the end of Xerxes I&#x27;s invasion in 479 BC. The exact date of the treaty is debated, but it is usually placed after the Battle of the Eurymedon (469 or 466) or the Battle of Cypriot Salamis (450).

If it existed, the Peace of Callias gave autonomy to the Ionian states in Asia Minor, prohibited the encroachment of Persian satrapies within three days march of the Aegean coast and prohibited Persian ships from the Aegean. Athens also agreed not to interfere with Persia&#x27;s possessions in Asia Minor, Cyprus, Libya or Egypt. Athens had at the time lost a fleet, which was aiding an Egyptian revolt against Persia.

== Doubts about existence ==
Knowledge of the Peace of Callias comes from references by the 4th-century BC orators Isocrates and Demosthenes, as well as by the historian Diodorus. The ancient historian Theopompus deemed it a fabrication by arguing that the inscription of the treaty was a fake since the lettering that was used in it had not come into practice until half a century after the treaty was purported to have been agreed.

It is possible that the treaty never officially existed. If it was concluded, its importance is disputed. Thucydides does not mention it, but Herodotus states something that may reasonably be construed as supporting its existence, as does Plutarch, who thinks that it either was signed after the Battle of the Eurymedon (466 BC) or was never signed at all.

==Aftermath==
In any case, there seems to have been some agreement reached ending hostilities with Persia after 450/449, which allowed Athens to deal with the new threats from the other Greek city-states such as Corinth and Thebes, as well as Euboea, which rebelled from the Delian League shortly afterward. The conflicts may have arisen when Athenian &#x27;allies&#x27; felt that there was no longer a justification for the Delian League, which had developed from the Spartan-led Hellenic League, which defeated Xerxes I&#x27;s invasion, as Persia was apparently no longer a threat. Since Athens demanded more and more tribute and exerted more political and economic control over its allies, the league became more of a true empire, and many of Athens&#x27;s allies began to rebel. Although Callias was also responsible for the Thirty Years&#x27; Peace with Sparta in 446 to 445 BC, the growing Athenian threat eventually led to the Peloponnesian War.

Fighting between the Greeks and the Persians subsided after 450, but Persia continued to meddle in Greek affairs and was to become instrumental in securing a Spartan victory during the Peloponnesian War.

Nonetheless, the treaty&#x27;s existence has remained a controversial topic among historians and scholars.

<text>Jeanne St. Laurent (née Renault; October 22, 1886 – November 14, 1966) was the wife of Louis St. Laurent, the 12th Prime Minister of Canada.

== Biography ==
Renault was born in Beauceville, Quebec. Her parents were Pierre-Ferdinand Renault (1853–1912) and Amanda Montminy (1853–1922). Pierre-Ferdinand Renault was a Beauceville businessman (originally from Ste-Claire-de-Dorchester, Quebec) and changed his family name from Renaud.

Renault met Louis St. Laurent at a party in Quebec City in 1906 while he was working as a lawyer, and they married in 1908. They had five children together, two sons and three daughters. In 1951, she moved the family to Ottawa, after the government purchased an official prime-ministerial residence at 24 Sussex Drive. She would tour with her husband, but she refused to fly and never became reconciled to living in Ottawa.

<doc id="386274" wikidata="Q274639" url="?curid=386274" title="Élie Cartan">
<text>Élie Joseph Cartan (; 9 April 1869 – 6 May 1951) was an influential French mathematician who did fundamental work in the theory of Lie groups, differential systems (coordinate-free geometric formulation of PDEs), and differential geometry. He also made significant contributions to general relativity and indirectly to quantum mechanics. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century.

His son Henri Cartan was an influential mathematician working in algebraic topology.

==Life==
Élie Cartan was born 9 April 1869 in the village of Dolomieu, Isère to Joseph Cartan (1837–1917) and Anne Cottaz (1841–1927). Joseph Cartan was the village blacksmith; Élie Cartan recalled that his childhood had passed under &quot;blows of the anvil, which started every morning from dawn&quot;, and that &quot;his mother, during those rare minutes when she was free from taking care of the children and the
house, was working with a spinning-wheel&quot;. Élie had an elder sister Jeanne-Marie (1867–1931) who became a dressmaker; a younger brother Léon (1872–1956) who became a blacksmith working in his father&#x27;s smithy; and a younger sister Anna Cartan (1878–1923), who, partly under Élie&#x27;s influence, entered École Normale Supérieure (as Élie had before) and chose a career as a mathematics teacher at a lycée (secondary school).

Élie Cartan entered an elementary school in Dolomieu and was the best student in the school. One of his teachers, M. Dupuis, recalled &quot;Élie Cartan was a shy student, but an unusual light of great intellect was shining in his eyes, and this was combined with an excellent memory&quot;. Antonin Dubost, then the representative of Isère, visited the school and was impressed by Cartan&#x27;s unusual abilities. He recommended Cartan to participate in a contest for a scholarship in a lycée. Cartan prepared for the contest under the supervision of M. Dupuis and passed at the age of ten. He spent five years (1880–1885) at the College of Vienne and then two years (1885–1887) at the Lycée of Grenoble. In 1887 he moved to the Lycée Janson de Sailly in Paris to study sciences for two years; there he met and befriended his classmate Jean-Baptiste Perrin (1870–1942) who later became a famous physicist in France.

Cartan enrolled in the École Normale Supérieure in 1888, where he attended lectures by Charles Hermite (1822–1901), Jules Tannery (1848–1910), Gaston Darboux (1842–1917), Paul Appell (1855–1930), Émile Picard (1856–1941), Édouard Goursat (1858–1936), and Henri Poincaré (1854–1912) whose lectures were what Cartan thought most highly of.

After graduation from the École Normale Superieure in 1891, Cartan was drafted into the French army, where he served one year and attained the rank of sergeant. For the next two years (1892–1894) Cartan returned to ENS and, following the advice of his classmate Arthur Tresse (1868–1958) who studied under Sophus Lie in the years 1888–1889, worked on the subject of classification of simple Lie groups, which was started by Wilhelm Killing. In 1892 Lie came to Paris, at the invitation of Darboux and Tannery, and met Cartan for the first time.

Cartan defended his dissertation, &quot;The structure of finite continuous groups of transformations&quot; in 1894 in the Faculty of Sciences in the Sorbonne. Between 1894 and 1896 Cartan was a lecturer at the University of Montpellier; during the years 1896 through 1903, he was a lecturer in the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Lyon.

In 1903, while in Lyon, Cartan married Marie-Louise Bianconi (1880–1950); in the same year, Cartan became a professor in the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Nancy. In 1904, Cartan&#x27;s first son, Henri Cartan, who later became an influential mathematician, was born; in 1906, another son, Jean Cartan, who became a composer, was born. In 1909 Cartan moved his family to Paris and worked as a lecturer in the Faculty of Sciences in the Sorbonne. In 1912 Cartan became Professor there, based on the reference he received from Poincaré. He remained in Sorbonne until his retirement in 1940 and spent the last years of his life teaching mathematics at the École Normale Supérieure for girls.

As a student of Cartan, the geometer Shiing-Shen Chern wrote:Usually the day after [meeting with Cartan] I would get a letter from him. He would say, “After you left, I thought more about your questions...”—he had some results, and some more questions, and so on. He knew all these papers on simple Lie groups, Lie algebras, all by heart. When you saw him on the street, when a certain issue would come up, he would pull out some old envelope and write something and give you the answer. And sometimes it took me hours or even days to get the same answer... I had to work very hard.In 1921 he became a foreign member of the Polish Academy of Learning and in 1937 a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1938 he participated in the International Committee composed to organise the International Congresses for the Unity of Science.

He died in 1951 in Paris after a long illness.

In 1976, a lunar crater was named after him. Before, it was designated Apollonius D.

==Work==
In the &quot;Travaux&quot;, Cartan breaks down his work into 15 areas. Using modern terminology, they are:

# Lie theory
# Representations of Lie groups
# Hypercomplex numbers, division algebras
# Systems of PDEs, Cartan–Kähler theorem
# Theory of equivalence
# Integrable systems, theory of prolongation and systems in involution
# Infinite-dimensional groups and pseudogroups
# Differential geometry and moving frames
# Generalised spaces with structure groups and connections, Cartan connection, holonomy, Weyl tensor
# Geometry and topology of Lie groups
# Riemannian geometry
# Symmetric spaces
# Topology of compact groups and their homogeneous spaces
# Integral invariants and classical mechanics
# Relativity, spinors

Cartan&#x27;s mathematical work can be described as the development of analysis on differentiable manifolds, which many now consider the central and most vital part of modern mathematics and which he was foremost in shaping and advancing. This field centers on Lie groups, partial differential systems, and differential geometry; these, chiefly through Cartan&#x27;s contributions, are now closely interwoven and constitute a unified and powerful tool.

===Lie groups===
Cartan was practically alone in the field of Lie groups for the thirty years after his dissertation. Lie had considered these groups chiefly as systems of analytic transformations of an analytic manifold, depending analytically on a finite number of parameters. A very fruitful approach to the study of these groups was opened in 1888 when Wilhelm Killing systematically started to study the group in itself, independent of its possible actions on other manifolds. At that time (and until 1920) only local properties were considered, so the main object of study for Killing was the Lie algebra of the group, which exactly reflects the local properties in purely algebraic terms. Killing&#x27;s great achievement was the determination of all simple complex Lie algebras; his proofs, however, were often defective, and Cartan&#x27;s thesis was devoted mainly to giving a rigorous foundation to the local theory and to proving the existence of the exceptional Lie algebras belonging to each of the types of simple complex Lie algebras that Killing had shown to be possible. Later Cartan completed the local theory by explicitly solving two fundamental problems, for which he had to develop entirely new methods: the classification of simple real Lie algebras and the determination of all irreducible linear representations of simple Lie algebras, by means of the notion of weight of a representation, which he introduced for that purpose. It was in the process of determining the linear representations of the orthogonal groups that Cartan discovered in 1913 the spinors, which later played such an important role in quantum mechanics.

After 1925 Cartan grew more and more interested in topological questions. Spurred by Weyl&#x27;s brilliant results on compact groups, he developed new methods for the study of global properties of Lie groups; in particular he showed that topologically a connected Lie group is a product of a Euclidean space and a compact group, and for compact Lie groups he discovered that the possible fundamental groups of the underlying manifold can be read from the structure of the Lie algebra of the group. Finally, he outlined a method of determining the Betti numbers of compact Lie groups, again reducing the problem to an algebraic question on their Lie algebras, which has since been completely solved.

===Lie pseudogroups===
After solving the problem of the structure of Lie groups which Cartan (following Lie) called &quot;finite continuous groups&quot; (or &quot;finite transformation groups&quot;), Cartan posed the similar problem for &quot;infinite continuous groups&quot;, which are now called Lie pseudogroups, an infinite-dimensional analogue of Lie groups (there are other infinite generalizations of Lie groups). The Lie pseudogroup considered by Cartan is a set of transformations between subsets of a space that contains the identical transformation and possesses the property that the result of composition of two transformations in this set (whenever this is possible) belongs to the same set. Since the composition of two transformations is not always possible, the set of transformations is not a group (but a groupoid in modern terminology), thus the name pseudogroup. Cartan considered only those transformations of manifolds for which there is no subdivision of manifolds into the classes transposed by the transformations under consideration. Such pseudogroups of transformations are called primitive. Cartan showed that every infinite-dimensional primitive pseudogroup of complex analytic transformations belongs to one of the six classes: 1) the pseudogroup of all analytic transformations of &quot;n&quot; complex variables; 2) the pseudogroup of all analytic transformations of &quot;n&quot; complex variables with a constant Jacobian (i.e., transformations that multiply all volumes by the same complex number); 3) the pseudogroup of all analytic transformations of &quot;n&quot; complex variables whose Jacobian is equal to one (i.e., transformations that preserve volumes); 4) the pseudogroup of all analytic transformations of 2&quot;n&quot; &gt; 4 complex variables that preserve a certain double integral (the symplectic pseudogroup); 5) the pseudogroup of all analytic transformations of 2&quot;n&quot; &gt; 4 complex variables that multiply the above-mentioned double integral by a complex function; 6) the pseudogroup of all analytic transformations of 2&quot;n&quot; + 1 complex variables that multiply a certain form by a complex function (the contact pseudogroup). There are similar classes of pseudogroups for primitive pseudogroups of real transformations defined by analytic functions of real variables.

===Differential systems===
Cartan&#x27;s methods in the theory of differential systems are perhaps his most profound achievement. Breaking with tradition, he sought from the start to formulate and solve the problems in a completely invariant fashion, independent of any particular choice of variables and unknown functions. He thus was able for the first time to give a precise definition of what is a &quot;general&quot; solution of an arbitrary differential system. His next step was to try to determine all &quot;singular&quot; solutions as well, by a method of &quot;prolongation&quot; that consists in adjoining new unknowns and new equations to the given system in such a way that any singular solution of the original system becomes a general solution of the new system. Although Cartan showed that in every example which he treated his method led to the complete determination of all singular solutions, he did not succeed in proving in general that this would always be the case for an arbitrary system; such a proof was obtained in 1955 by Masatake Kuranishi.

Cartan&#x27;s chief tool was the calculus of exterior differential forms, which he helped to create and develop in the ten years following his thesis and then proceeded to apply to a variety of problems in differential geometry, Lie groups, analytical dynamics, and general relativity. He discussed a large number of examples, treating them in an extremely elliptic style that was made possible only by his uncanny algebraic and geometric insight.

===Differential geometry===
Cartan&#x27;s contributions to differential geometry are no less impressive, and it may be said that he revitalized the whole subject, for the initial work of Riemann and Darboux was being lost in dreary computations and minor results, much as had happened to elementary geometry and invariant theory a generation earlier. His guiding principle was a considerable extension of the method of &quot;moving frames&quot; of Darboux and Ribaucour, to which he gave a tremendous flexibility and power, far beyond anything that had been done in classical differential geometry. In modern terms, the method consists in associating to a fiber bundle &quot;E&quot; the principal fiber bundle having the same base and having at each point of the base a fiber equal to the group that acts on the fiber of &quot;E&quot; at the same point. If &quot;E&quot; is the tangent bundle over the base (which since Lie was essentially known as the manifold of &quot;contact elements&quot;), the corresponding group is the general linear group (or the orthogonal group in classical Euclidean or Riemannian geometry). Cartan&#x27;s ability to handle many other types of fibers and groups allows one to credit him with the first general idea of a fiber bundle, although he never defined it explicitly. This concept has become one of the most important in all fields of modern mathematics, chiefly in global differential geometry and in algebraic and differential topology. Cartan used it to formulate his definition of a connection, which is now used universally and has superseded previous attempts by several geometers, made after 1917, to find a type of &quot;geometry&quot; more general than the Riemannian model and perhaps better adapted to a description of the universe along the lines of general relativity.

Cartan showed how to use his concept of connection to obtain a much more elegant and simple presentation of Riemannian geometry. His chief contribution to the latter, however, was the discovery and study of the symmetric Riemann spaces, one of the few instances in which the initiator of a mathematical theory was also the one who brought it to its completion. Symmetric Riemann spaces may be defined in various ways, the simplest of which postulates the existence around each point of the space of a &quot;symmetry&quot; that is involutive, leaves the point fixed, and preserves distances. The unexpected fact discovered by Cartan is that it is possible to give a complete description of these spaces by means of the classification of the simple Lie groups; it should therefore not be surprising that in various areas of mathematics, such as automorphic functions and analytic number theory (apparently far removed from differential geometry), these spaces are playing a part that is becoming increasingly important.

==Alternative theory to general relativity==

Cartan created a competitor theory of gravity also Einstein–Cartan theory.

<text>Zoé, Lady Laurier ( Lafontaine; June 26, 1841 – November 1, 1921), was the wife of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the seventh Prime Minister of Canada.

==Biography==

Zoé Lafontaine was born on 27 June 1841 to Godefroy-Napoleon Robert Lafontaine and Zoé Tessier dite Lavigne in Montreal. She was baptized on 28 June at the Notre-Dame Basilica.

In Montreal, Lafontaine was educated at the School of the Bon Pasteur, and at the Convent of the Sisters of the Sacred Heart, St. Vincent de Paul. She was one of the vice presidents on the formation of the National Council of Women of Canada and was honorary vice president of the Victorian Order of Nurses.

In 1861, Lafontaine first met her future husband, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, at the home of Dr. Séraphin Gauthier, where both were boarding. During this time she was a piano teacher to Gauthier&#x27;s children.

On May 13, 1868, the two were married in the Saint-Jacques Cathedral. The couple lived at Arthabaskaville until they moved to Ottawa in 1896. Ultimately, their union was childless, to Laurier&#x27;s dismay.

Lafontaine was one of the vice presidents on the formation of the National Council of Women and was honorary vice president of the Victorian Order of Nurses.

On 17 February 1919, Laurier died. Lafontaine outlived her husband by more than two years. She died in Ottawa on November 1, 1921, at the age of 80.

Her will bequeathed her Ottawa home to William Lyon Mackenzie King.

<text>Daniel Carlsson Solander or Daniel Charles Solander (19 February 1733 – 13 May 1782) was a Swedish naturalist and an apostle of Carl Linnaeus. Solander was the first university-educated scientist to set foot on Australian soil.

==Biography==
Solander was born in Piteå, Norrbotten, Sweden, to Rev. Carl Solander a Lutheran principal, and Magdalena (née Bostadia). Solander enrolled at Uppsala University in July 1750 and initially studied languages, the humanities and law. The professor of botany was the celebrated Carl Linnaeus, who was soon impressed by young Solander&#x27;s ability and accordingly persuaded his father to let him study natural history. Solander travelled to England in June 1760 to promote the new Linnean system of classification. In February 1763, he began cataloguing the natural history collections of the British Museum, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June the following year.

In 1768, Solander gained leave of absence from the British Museum and with his assistant Herman Spöring accompanied Joseph Banks on James Cook&#x27;s first voyage to the Pacific Ocean aboard the &quot;Endeavour&quot;. They were the botanists who inspired the name &quot;Botanist Bay&quot; (which later became Botany Bay) for the first landing place of Cook&#x27;s expedition in Australia. Solander helped make and describe an important collection of Australian plants while the &quot;Endeavour&quot; was beached at the site of present-day Cooktown for nearly seven weeks, after being damaged on the Great Barrier Reef. These collections later formed the basis of Banks&#x27; Florilegium.

Solander also wrote a manuscript describing all the species collected from New Zealand during the six months the 1768 expedition spent there. It was called &quot;Primitiae Florae Novae Zelandiae&quot; (&#x27;beginnings of a New Zealand flora&#x27;), and was to be illustrated with the plates prepared by Banks. It was never published, but it was available for study by anyone interested, first at Banks&#x27; London home, then at the Natural History section of the British Museum.

Solander&#x27;s return to Britain with Cook and Banks made him the first Swede to circumnavigate the globe.

On their return in 1771, Solander resumed his duties at the British Museum but also collaborated with Banks on the Florilegium. In 1772, he accompanied Banks on his voyage to Iceland, the Hebrides and the Orkney Islands. Between 1773 and 1782 he was Keeper of the Natural History Department of the British Museum. In 1773, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Solander died at Banks&#x27; home in Soho Square of a stroke, aged 49, on 13 May 1782. An autopsy was performed the next day, and revealed a brain hemorrhage. He is buried in the Swedish Section at Brookwood Cemetery.

==Legacy==

Solander&#x27;s reputation has been profoundly influenced by his limited number of publications and his premature death. Although he had detailed descriptions prepared for most of the botanical specimens he collected on the &quot;Endeavour&quot; voyage, in deference to Joseph Banks, Solander held off publication waiting for the completion of over 700 engravings. However, after Solander&#x27;s death, Banks, now President of the Royal Society, failed to publish his projected &quot;Florilegium&quot;. Had he done so, he would have secured Solander&#x27;s posthumous reputation. It has been claimed that Banks treated Solander, and Jonas Dryander, as his servants rather than as botanists of equal standing to others in the botanical establishment. However, Banks clearly had a strong emotional bond with Solander, met his expenses and even supported his relatives in Sweden. In 1784, when he wrote to Johan Alströmer of Solander&#x27;s death, Banks declared: &#x27;This too early loss of a friend, whom I during my more mature years have loved and whom I will always miss, makes me wish to draw a veil over his death, as soon as I have ceased to speak of it. I can never think of it without feeling a mortal pain.&#x27; Solander remained an employee of the British Museum for the last decade of his life but was also paid by Banks to assist him with his collections. Banks&#x27; relationship with Robert Brown was more formal.

Solander invented the book-form box known as the Solander box which is still used in libraries and archives as the most suitable way of storing prints, drawings, herbarium materials and some manuscripts.

Solander Gardens in the east end of London is named after him, as are the Solander Islands off New Zealand&#x27;s South Island and Cape Solander in the Kamay Botany Bay National Park, also in the suburb of Redfern near Sydney NSW the housing commission towers include a Daniel Solander building. Also Solander Island, off the NW coast of Vancouver Island, Canada. One of the many plants named in his honour is &quot;Fuscospora solandri&quot; (black beech). Solander was associated with Banks in &quot;Illustrations of the Botany of Captain Cook&#x27;s Voyage Round the World&quot;, and his &quot;The Natural History of Many Curious and Uncommon Zoophytes, Collected by the late John Ellis&quot;, (1786) was published posthumously. The &#x27;Daniel Solander Library&#x27; in Sydney&#x27;s Royal Botanic Garden, established in 1852, is the oldest botanical research library in Australia.

The scientific name of the Providence Petrel, &quot;Pterodroma solandri&quot;, was given in his honour by ornithologist John Gould.

The shrub &quot;Banksia solandri&quot; is named after him. Herbarium specimens collected by Solander and Banks are cared for in herbaria, including at the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL), Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria

In Solander&#x27;s birth town Piteå, the Solander Science Park houses a number of cleantech companies and research organizations.
Solander Street in Pelican Waters (a suburb in the Sunshine Coast of south-east Queensland, Australia) is one of several nearby streets with names linked to the round-the-world voyage of Captain James Cook that landed at Botany Bay in 1770.

<text>Annie Emma Thompson, Lady Thompson (née Affleck; June 26, 1842 – April 10, 1913) was the wife of Sir John Thompson, the fourth Prime Minister of Canada.

She was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to James Affleck, a sea captain, and Catherine Saunders. She was the eldest of eight children. She has been described by historians as a high-spirited young woman who resembled Catherine Linton in Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;.

She married Thompson in 1870 in Portland, Maine. Their first child, a son, was stillborn on September 3, 1871. They had eight more children:

#John Thomas Connolly Thompson (1872–1952)
#Joseph Thompson (1874–1935)
#Mary Aloysia (Babe) Thompson (1876–1917)
#Mary Helena Thompson (1878–1944)
#Annie Mary Thompson (1879–1880)
#unknown name (died at birth, December 7, 1880)
#Frances Alice (Frankie) Thompson (1881–1947)
#David Anthony Thompson (1883–1885)

In 1882, when John Thompson was concerned about losing an electoral battle in Antigonish, Annie wrote him to say that &quot;I wish I could be with you for one ten minutes to talk square to you...So keep up your courage... win or lose they can&#x27;t keep you from me much longer...So now you must not be such an awful baby until you get home and then I&#x27;ll see how far you can be indulged.&quot;

John Thompson was appointed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in 1882. When he was offered the opportunity to become Minister of Justice in 1885, Annie Thompson encouraged him to leave that bunch of &quot;sere old crows&quot; (her words) on the Nova Scotia bench and get out into a world which would better test and demonstrate his talents. The Thompson family finally moved to Ottawa in 1888, and John Thompson became Prime Minister in 1892.

On December 12, 1894, John Thompson died of a heart attack in Windsor Castle at the age of 49. He left a very small estate, and the Lady Thompson Fund was begun that month as a private subscription for the children.

Lady Thompson moved to Toronto in 1895. Friends, including Lady Aberdeen and Senator Frank Smith, aided her in finding housing and establishing herself. She lived at St Joseph Street, and became a member of the nearby St Basil&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church.

In hospital in 1913 for exploratory surgery, she was diagnosed with inoperable cancer and died on the operating table. She was buried in Mount Hope Catholic Cemetery in Toronto (her husband was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery, Halifax).

<doc id="386292" wikidata="Q332971" url="?curid=386292" title="Agnes Macdonald, 1st Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe">
<text>Susan Agnes Macdonald, 1st Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe (née Bernard; 24 August 1836 – 5 September 1920), was the second wife of Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada.

==Early life==
Agnes was born in Spanish Town, Jamaica, to Thomas James Bernard (1796–1850), of Bellevue, south of Montego Bay; member of the Privy Council of the Colony of Jamaica, slave and sugar plantation owner. Her mother, Theodora Foulks Hewitt (1802–1875), was the daughter of William Hewitt, also of Jamaica, descended from a brother of James Hewitt, 1st Viscount Lifford. She was raised both in Jamaica and in England. The family lost their residence to a planation riot in 1831, which ended the Bernards&#x27; time in Jamaica with emancipation of their slaves in 1832.
==Marriage and family==
After her father&#x27;s death from cholera she came to Barrie, Upper Canada, with her mother in 1854 to live with her brother, Hewitt Bernard (who left in 1851 after giving up the family plantation), a lawyer and private secretary to political leader John A. Macdonald.

It was through him that she met Macdonald in 1856. It was in 1866, in London, England, where Miss Bernard had been with her mother that she again met her husband-to-be, who was there to prepare the British North America Act. They married on 16 February 1867, and had one daughter, Margaret Mary Theodora Macdonald (1869–1933), who was born severely handicapped, both mentally and physically.

==Wife of the prime minister==
On the first prime ministerial trip to British Columbia on the newly opened Canadian Pacific Railway, Macdonald built Agnes a platform on the cowcatcher of the locomotive and had a chair nailed to it so she could better see the mountain scenery. During her life in Canada with her husband, she became intimately acquainted with many of the intricacies of the political and historical events of the country.

Mount Lady Macdonald in Bow River Valley is named after her.

Lady Macdonald Drive in Canmore, Alberta, is named after her.

==Later life==
After her husband&#x27;s death in 1891 she was raised to the peerage in his honour as Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe, in the Province of Ontario and Dominion of Canada. By 1896 she left her home at Earnscliffe to go back to England. She actively participated in social and philanthropic work late into life. She died in England in September 1920, aged 84, and was buried in the Ocklynge Cemetery in Eastbourne.

The barony became extinct on her death. Her daughter died in 1933 and also buried in Ocklynge Cemetery. She is the only wife of a Canadian prime minister to be buried outside of Canada and one of two not buried with their spouse.

<doc id="386295" wikidata="Q6831241" url="?curid=386295" title="Michael Horton (theologian)">
<text>Michael Scott Horton (born May 11, 1964) is an American theologican who is the J. Gresham Machen Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics at Westminster Seminary California. He is a scholar and theologian, having written and edited more than forty books and contributed to various encyclopedias, including the &quot;Oxford Handbook of Reformed Theology&quot; and Brill’s Encyclopedia of Christianity.

In addition to his work as a professor, Horton is the founder of Sola Media and its productions, the &quot;White Horse Inn&quot; radio show and podcast, &quot;Modern Reformation&quot; magazine, &quot;Core Christianity&quot;, and &quot;Theo Global&quot;.

His most recent book is &quot;Shaman and Sage: The Roots of “Spiritual but Not Religious” in Antiquity&quot;, the first of three volumes in his intellectual history of “spiritual but not religious” as a phenomenon in Western culture.

His books include &quot;Justification&quot; (2 vols), &quot;The Christian Faith&quot;, &quot;Pilgrim Theology&quot;, &quot;For Calvinism&quot;, and &quot;People and Place: A Covenant Ecclesiology&quot;, and his writing has been featured in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Books and Culture&quot;, &quot;Modern Reformation&quot;, &quot;Pro Ecclesia&quot;, and the &quot;International Journal of Systematic Theology]&quot;. His popular writing also spans titles, such as &quot;Christless Christianity: The Alternative Gospel of the American Church&quot;; &quot;Recovering Our Sanity: How the Fear of God Conquers the Fears that Divide Us&quot;; &quot;Beyond Culture Wars&quot;, &quot;Rediscovering the Holy Spirit: God’s Perfecting Presence in Creation, Redemption, and Everyday Life&quot;; &quot;Ordinary: Sustainable Faith in a Radical, Restless World&quot;; and &quot;Calvin on the Christian Life: Glorifying and Enjoying God Forever&quot;.

==History==
Horton was raised in an Arminian Baptist church. While in high school, Horton adopted Calvinistic beliefs as he read through the Bible, specifically the book of Romans. Horton claims he &quot;threw his Bible across the room&quot; as he read through Romans 9 and began to wrestle through the doctrines of election/predestination and the sovereignty of God. He began attending the Philadelphia Conference on Reformed Theology, where he met James Montgomery Boice, R.C. Sproul, and J.I. Packer.

Horton received a BA degree at Biola University. Since high school, he had always known that he wanted to go to Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. At the time, Westminster Seminary California was just starting in a small storefront in Escondido but many of the men Horton was reading at the time taught there, and this eventually led to his choice to get his MA there. He learned Biblical Hebrew and Koine Greek, and studied under Meredith Kline.

Horton received his PhD from Wycliffe Hall, Oxford through Coventry University and completed a research fellowship at Yale Divinity School.

He was ordained a deacon in the Reformed Episcopal Church. He was the president of Christians United for Reformation (CURE), which later merged to become the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals (ACE). From 2001 to 2004 Horton served as the president of ACE, but is now no longer affiliated with that organization. He is also an ordained minister in the United Reformed Churches in North America (URCNA), has served at two churches in Southern California, and was the Associate Pastor at Christ United Reformed Church in Santee, California, a URCNA member church. Horton taught an adult Sunday school class on God, suffering, sanctification, Calvinist theology, and the basics of the Heidelberg Catechism. This class is available on audio at the church website. 

In 1996 &quot;Christianity Today&quot; included him on their list of &quot;Up &amp; Comers: Fifty evangelical leaders 40 and under.&quot;

<text>John Louis O&#x27;Sullivan (November 15, 1813 – March 24, 1895) was an American columnist, editor, and diplomat who coined the term &quot;manifest destiny&quot; in 1845 to promote the annexation of Texas and the Oregon Country to the United States. O&#x27;Sullivan was an influential political writer and advocate for the Democratic Party at that time and served as U.S. minister to Portugal during the administration of President Franklin Pierce (1853–1857).

==Early life and education==
John Louis O&#x27;Sullivan, born on November 15, 1813, was the son of Irishman John Thomas O&#x27;Sullivan, an American diplomat and sea captain, and Mary Rowly, a genteel Englishwoman. According to legend, he was born at sea on a British warship off the coast of Gibraltar. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s father was a naturalized US citizen and had served as US Consul to the Barbary States.

O&#x27;Sullivan enrolled at Columbia College in New York at the age of 14. He graduated in 1831. In 1834, he received a Masters of Arts and became a lawyer.

== Career ==
In 1837, he founded and edited &quot;The United States Magazine and Democratic Review,&quot; based in Washington. It espoused the more radical forms of Jacksonian Democracy and the cause of a democratic, American literature. It published some of the most prominent American writers, including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, John Greenleaf Whittier, William Cullen Bryant, and Walt Whitman. O&#x27;Sullivan was an aggressive reformer in the New York State Legislature, where he led the unsuccessful movement to abolish capital punishment. By 1846, investors were dissatisfied with his poor management, and he lost control of his magazine.

O&#x27;Sullivan opposed the coming of the American Civil War, hoping that a peaceful solution, or a peaceful separation of North and South, could be resolved. In Europe when the war began, O&#x27;Sullivan became an active supporter of the Confederate States of America; he may have been on the Confederate payroll at some point. O&#x27;Sullivan wrote a number of pamphlets promoting the Confederate cause, arguing that the presidency had become too powerful and that states&#x27; rights needed to be protected against encroachment by the central government. Although he had earlier supported the &quot;free soil&quot; movement, he now defended the institution of slavery, writing that blacks and whites could not live together in harmony. His activities greatly disappointed some of his old friends, including Hawthorne. Towards the end of the Civil War, O&#x27;Sullivan appealed to his southern &quot;comrades in arms&quot; to burn Richmond, stating &quot;let every man set fire to his own house&quot;.

<doc id="386302" wikidata="Q168713" url="?curid=386302" title="Russian cruiser Aurora">
<text>Aurora () is a Russian protected cruiser, currently preserved as a museum ship in Saint Petersburg. &quot;Aurora&quot; was one of three cruisers, built in Saint Petersburg for service in the Pacific. All three ships of this class served during the Russo-Japanese War. &quot;Aurora&quot; survived the Battle of Tsushima and was interned under US protection in the Philippines, and eventually returned to the Baltic Fleet. Aurora is most famous for her actions during the October Revolution where she reportedly fired the shot, that signaled the beginning of the attack on the Winter Palace.

==Russo-Japanese War==
Soon after completion, on 10 October 1903, &quot;Aurora&quot; departed Kronstadt as part of Admiral Virenius&#x27;s &quot;reinforcing squadron&quot; for Port Arthur. 
While in the Red Sea, still en route to Port Arthur, the squadron was recalled back to the Baltic Sea, under protest by Admiral Makarov, who specifically requested Admiral Virenius to continue his mission to Port Arthur. Only the seven destroyers of the reinforcing squadron were allowed to continue to the Far East.

After her detachment from the reinforcing squadron and her arrival back to home port she underwent new refitting. After refitting, &quot;Aurora&quot; was ordered back to Port Arthur as part of the Russian Baltic Fleet &quot;Aurora&quot; sailed as part of Admiral Oskar Enkvist&#x27;s Cruiser Squadron whose flagship would be the protected cruiser &quot;Oleg&quot;, an element of Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky&#x27;s &quot;Baltic Fleet.&quot; On the way to the Far East, &quot;Aurora&quot; received five hits, sustaining light damage from confused friendly fire, which killed the ship&#x27;s chaplain and a sailor, in the Dogger Bank incident.

During the Battle of Tsushima the Aurora was only lightly damaged but the ship&#x27;s captain Evgeny Egoriev was killed. At nightfall the &quot;Aurora&quot; along with the &quot;Oleg&quot; were attacked by torpedo boats and at 22:00 they gave up trying to proceed north and headed southwest. Once dawn arrived it was found that Zhemchug had retreated with the other two ships. Enkvist decided transfer his command to the Aurora then take his ships to Manila and American internment. On the way to Manila the ship&#x27;s doctor managed to set up the ship&#x27;s X-ray equipment and performed the first post battle X-rays in Russian naval history. Evgeny Egoriev was buried at sea June 3 1905.

==World War I, Mutiny and Revolution==
During World War I &quot;Aurora&quot; operated in the Baltic Sea performing patrols and shore bombardment tasks. In 1915, her armament was changed to fourteen 152 mm (6 in) guns. In late 1916 she was moved to Petrograd for repairs. 

By late 1916, when &quot;Aurora&quot; arrived in Petrograd, conditions in the capital had deteriorated and the city was lawless and suffering from a cold winter and food shortages. Dissatisfaction with the Tsar was approaching a breaking point. 

During the February Revolution a significant number of the enlisted men had become sympathetic with, or had outright joined the Bolsheviks. This let to increasing tensions between the officer class - who were generally Tsarists - and the enlisted men.

Tensions came to a head after officers fired their pistols at the enlisted men in an attempt to restore order. The crew captured the ship&#x27;s captain, Mikhail Nikolsky, and ordered that he carry a red flag as a symbol of support for the Bolshevik cause. When he declined, he was shot and killed as were an unknown number of the ship&#x27;s officers.

A revolutionary committee was formed and a new captain was elected. The ship joined the Bolshevik cause and became the first major Russian warship to fly the red flag of the Bolshevik cause.

On the eve of the October Revolution the ship was assigned to dislodge loyalist military cadets from the Nikolayevsky Bridge. After carrying out that assignment, the ship fired the famous blank shot that, according to Russian lore, was the signal to begin the assault on the Winter Palace. It is for this action that the ship is best known and most closely identified in Russian culture.

In 1918 Aurora was relocated to the naval dockyard at Kronstadt and her new 6-inch guns were removed and installed on floating batteries to be used by the Bolsheviks during the civil war. 

==Second World War==
In 1922, &quot;Aurora&quot; returned to service as a training ship. 

During the Second World War, her guns were taken from the ship and used in the land defence of Leningrad. The ship herself was docked in Oranienbaum port, and was repeatedly shelled and bombed. On 30 September 1941, she was damaged and sunk in the harbour.

She was later salvaged and repaired after the war.

==Post World War II==
The ship was opened as a museum ship in Leningrad in 1957, as a monument to the October Revolution.

After having served as a museum ship for 27 years, from 1984 to 1987 the cruiser was once again placed in her construction yard, the Admiralty Shipyard, for capital restoration. During the overhaul, due to deterioration, the ship&#x27;s hull below the waterline was replaced with a new welded hull according to the original drawings. The cut off lower hull section was towed into the Gulf of Finland to the decommissioned , and sunk near the shore. The restoration revealed that some of the ship&#x27;s parts, including the armour plates, were originally made in Britain.

In January 2013, Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu announced plans to recommission &quot;Aurora&quot; and make her the flagship of the Russian Navy due to her historical and cultural importance. On 21 September 2014, the ship was towed to the Admiralty Shipyard in Kronstadt to be overhauled, to return in 2016. On 16 July 2016, she returned to her home harbour in Saint Petersburg.

== In popular culture ==
The 1965 Soviet film &quot;The Salvos of the Aurora Cruiser&quot; shows the ship&#x27;s action in the October Revolution.

In 1973, a short film about the ship, titled &quot;Aurora&quot;, was released.

== Gallery ==
=== Aurora Flags ===
Due to the honoring of the ship with high state awards, the flag flown at the stern is a special version of the main Naval Ensign. This tradition dates back to 1927, when the aurora was awarded the Order of the Red Banner and lasted until the end of Soviet Navy and was then resumed after returning from a major overhaul in 2016.

<text>Sheila Ann Martin (née Cowan; born July 31, 1943) is the wife of Paul Martin, who served as the 21st Prime Minister of Canada from December 12, 2003, to February 6, 2006. Her father was William &quot;Bill&quot; Cowan, a lawyer and philanthropist from Windsor, Ontario. She was named after her mother. Sheila was raised Protestant, and graduated from the University of Toronto in 1964.

She and Paul were neighbours and her father was law partner with Paul Martin Sr in Windsor, Ontario. They were engaged over Christmas in 1964 and married on September 11, 1965. They have three sons: Paul William Martin III (born September 11, 1966), Jamie Robert Martin (born June 21, 1969), and David Patrick Martin (born September 13, 1974).

A Canada Steamship Lines ship, &quot;Sheila Ann&quot;, is named in her honour.

Before her husband became the Prime Minister of Canada, Sheila Martin&#x27;s work in Ottawa included serving on a committee called Politics and the Pen, and on this committee she helped give prizes and money to Canadian writers. The job was said to fit with her &quot;own literary tastes.&quot; In 2002, when Paul Martin left the cabinet, he credited her as a support to him and as an advisor:
:&quot;Third, I want to thank the many friends who called or sent messages in recent days. I&#x27;m enriched by their friendship and their support. In that respect, I want to thank above all others Sheila and my family for their patience and their advice.&quot;

Throughout these years, Sheila Martin apparently had little aspirations in regards to her husband&#x27;s office. Her husband&#x27;s biographer John Gray quoted her as saying, &quot;Oh, God, I don&#x27;t want to do this at all, so I just don&#x27;t think about it.&quot;

<doc id="386306" wikidata="Q7580157" url="?curid=386306" title="Spouse of the prime minister of Canada">
<text>The spouse of the prime minister of Canada () is the wife or husband of the prime minister of Canada. Sophie Grégoire Trudeau is married to the 23rd and current prime minister, Justin Trudeau, though the couple have been separated since August 2, 2023.

Nineteen women have been wives of prime ministers of Canada; Kim Campbell, the only female prime minister, was unmarried during her time in office. As semi-public figures, spouses are often present at various ceremonial, diplomatic, or partisan activities alongside the prime minister. Spouses often pursue philanthropic or charitable endeavours on their own, although the spouses have varied in how actively they sought or accepted the public spotlight.

Some media outlets have styled prime ministers&#x27; wives as the &quot;first lady of Canada&quot;, similar to the style of &quot;first lady&quot; used in the neighbouring United States and other republics. This is not a recognized nor accurately applicable title, as the spouses both of Canada&#x27;s monarch and of the governor general take precedence over the spouse of the prime minister. Rather, use of &quot;first lady&quot; is based on the influence of American media and a general misunderstanding of Canadian civics.

==Public role==
The prime minister is not the head of state; thus, their spouse does not officially play as active a role in Canadian affairs as do the royal and viceregal consorts. The prime minister&#x27;s spouse, however, is still generally regarded as a public or semi-public figure, frequently accompanying the prime minister on campaign and other public appearances, and often hosting dignitaries at the prime minister&#x27;s residence.

At times, prime ministers&#x27; spouses have used their public status to promote charitable causes: Mila Mulroney was a spokesperson for the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and other children&#x27;s charities, Aline Chrétien was an active campaigner for literacy programs, and Laureen Harper was known for her support of animal welfare organizations such as the Ottawa Humane Society. 

Many have also held an unofficial but influential role as a political or campaign advisor to their husbands: Laureen Harper was considered her husband&#x27;s &quot;secret weapon&quot;, whose instinctive sense of campaign optics proved invaluable to her husband&#x27;s career; Harper, for example, was credited as the brains behind a public appearance in which her husband, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, appeared on stage at Ottawa&#x27;s National Arts Centre to sing the Beatles&#x27; &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, which was widely perceived as softening the prime minister&#x27;s somewhat stiff and bureaucratic public image. Despite her relatively low public profile, Aline Chrétien was also recognized as a powerful advisor to her husband; &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine once wrote, &quot;Never mind calling her the power behind the throne—she shares the seat of power&quot;, and columnist Allan Fotheringham later called her the second most powerful political figure in Canada, behind her husband but ahead of any elected member of Parliament or any staffer in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office.

Some prime ministers&#x27; spouses have also attracted attention for other reasons: Maryon Pearson was noted for her prickly wit, having made a number of famous quips which are still regularly featured in anthologies of famous quotations. Margaret Trudeau, whom Pierre Trudeau married while in office, became a notable celebrity in her own right, most famously when she was featured on the covers of international tabloids after being seen partying at Studio 54. Maureen McTeer, spouse of Joe Clark, attracted controversy when she became the first spouse of a prime minister to retain her own surname after marriage. Mila Mulroney also rose to some notoriety due to her spending habits, and was satirized in &quot;Frank&quot; as Imelda because of her purportedly large collection of shoes.

Because the role of a prime minister&#x27;s spouse is not formally defined, however, a spouse may face criticism over her public visibility itself. In 2016, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau faced some controversy when she stated in an interview that she needed a staff assistant to keep on top of all the requests she received for public and charitable appearances, which some critics described as coming from a sense of personal entitlement or an attempt to turn herself into a First Lady.

==Other notes==
Canada has had two prime ministers who were bachelors, William Lyon Mackenzie King and R.B. Bennett. Mackenzie Bowell, a widower whose wife, Harriet, died in 1884, was also not married during his term in office. Pierre Trudeau began his term as a bachelor, became the first Canadian prime minister to get married while in office and ended it as Canada&#x27;s first divorced prime minister.

Three other Canadian prime ministers–Alexander Mackenzie, John Diefenbaker, and John A. Macdonald—were widowers who remarried before becoming prime minister. Macdonald, Canada&#x27;s first prime minister, had been a widower for ten years while in office in the former Province of Canada. His first wife was Isabella Clark, who died in 1857. Macdonald married his second wife, Agnes Bernard, while in London in 1867, during the final negotiations leading up to Confederation. Mackenzie&#x27;s first wife was Helen Neil, and Diefenbaker&#x27;s was Edna Brower.

Canada has also had one female prime minister, Kim Campbell. As she had finalized her divorce from her second husband, Howard Eddy, in early 1993, there has never been a male spouse of the prime minister (although Campbell&#x27;s first husband, Nathan Divinsky, did try to attract media attention in 1993 by billing himself as the ex-husband of the prime minister). She briefly dated Gregory Lekhtman, the inventor of Exerlopers, during her term as prime minister, but kept the relationship private and did not involve him in the 1993 election campaign. In 1997, after her prime ministership, she entered into a common-law marriage with Hershey Felder.

Maureen McTeer maintained a career during her life at 24 Sussex; although several others have had independent careers prior to their spouse&#x27;s term as prime minister, all others have put their own careers on hold to concentrate on the public and ceremonial and philanthropic aspects of their role as a leader&#x27;s spouse. McTeer was also the only spouse of a prime minister to use her birth surname, rather than her husband&#x27;s surname, in her public life; although Laureen (Teskey) Harper and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau both used their birth surnames prior to their husbands becoming prime ministers, both opted to minimize any controversy by using their husband&#x27;s surname once they were elevated to the public role of a prime minister&#x27;s spouse. Grégoire Trudeau did, however, become the first spouse of a prime minister to use her husband&#x27;s surname with her own.

<text>Westminster Theological Seminary (WTS) is a Protestant theological seminary in the Reformed theological tradition in Glenside, Pennsylvania. It was founded by members of the faculty of Princeton Theological Seminary in 1929 after Princeton chose to take a liberal direction during the Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy.

==History==

Westminster Theological Seminary was formed in 1929, largely under the leadership and funding of J. Gresham Machen. Though independent, it has a close relationship with the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, which Machen helped found in 1936. The seminary was founded by members of the faculty of Princeton Theological Seminary, following a controversy over the liberal direction that Princeton was beginning to take. Westminster Theological Seminary considers itself to be the faithful continuation of Princeton&#x27;s historic theological tradition. Many of the founders of Westminster, including Machen, John Murray, Oswald Allis, Robert Dick Wilson, and Cornelius Van Til, had been professors at Princeton prior to the controversy. The first president of the seminary was Edmund Clowney, who served from 1966 until 1984. He was followed by George C. Fuller and Samuel T. Logan. The current president is Peter Lillback, who also serves as a professor of historical theology.

In 1982, the California branch of Westminster became an independent institution, the Westminster Seminary California, and in 2009 the Dallas branch was established as Redeemer Theological Seminary and since 2017 has been Reformed Theological Seminary&#x27;s Dallas campus.

In 2011, Westminster signed a Memorandum of Understanding with International Reformed Evangelical Seminary in Jakarta, Indonesia. The two schools have been publishing the journals: International Journal of Reformed Theology and Life and Unio Cum Christo. Westminster also created an endowment for the Stephen Tong Chair of Reformed Theology the same year.

==Theological position==

In Philadelphia on September 25, 1929, J. Gresham Machen declared the following in his inaugural address: &quot;We believe, first, that the Christian religion, as set forth in the Confession of Faith of the Presbyterian Church, is true; we believe, second, that the Christian religion welcomes and is capable of scholarly defense; and we believe, third, that the Christian religion should be proclaimed without fear or favor, and in clear opposition to whatever opposes it, whether from within or without the church, as the only way of salvation for lost mankind. On that platform, brethren, we stand. Pray that we may be enabled by God’s grace to stand firm. Pray that the students who go forth from Westminster Theological Seminary may know Christ as their own Savior and may proclaim to others the gospel of his love.&quot;

The current board and faculty continue to hold to this original vision. All trustees and faculty members are required to affirm their agreement with the theological perspective presented in the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, the core doctrinal statements of many Presbyterian denominations.

Westminster&#x27;s strict adherence to the Westminster Standards and to Protestant theology in general has led to several dismissals of tenured faculty members since 1980. In 1981, theology professor Norman Shepherd was dismissed from Westminster due to his views on the doctrine of justification by faith alone. In 2008, Old Testament professor Peter Enns was dismissed from Westminster over controversial views expressed in his book &quot;Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament&quot;, and in 2014 Old Testament professor Douglas Green was terminated from his position over his views on the relationship between the Old Testament and the New Testament.

In the early 1990s, Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools disputed with Westminster because of its refusal to give women membership on the board of trustees. The accrediting body backed down after the United States Department of Education took the seminary&#x27;s side in the dispute.

==Accreditation==
Westminster, under a charter from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania granted in 1930 and as subsequently amended, has the power to grant the degrees of Master of Arts in Counseling, Master of Arts (Religion), Master of Divinity, Master of Theology, Doctor of Ministry, and Doctor of Philosophy.

Since 1954, Westminster is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. It is also accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.

==Academics==
The seminary currently offers the following degrees:
* Master of Arts (MA)
* Master of Divinity (M.Div.)
* Master of Theology (Th.M.)
* Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.)
* Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)

Westminster publishes the semi-annual &quot;Westminster Theological Journal&quot;.

==Legacy==
According to Roger E. Olson, Westminster has had an influence on evangelicalism far beyond its size. Beyond Westminster&#x27;s impact in the theological realm, the pioneering work of J. Alan Groves and his students has produced the codification of the Westminster Leningrad Codex, which underlies all modern Bible software.

<text>Jonas Carlsson Dryander (5 March 1748 – 19 October 1810) was a Swedish botanist.
==Biography==
Dryander was born in Gothenburg, Sweden. He was the son of Carl Leonard Dryander and Brita Maria Montin. He was a pupil of Carl Linnaeus at Uppsala University. He entered Lund University in 1778 and received his Master of Philosophy in 1778.

He arrived in London on 10 July 1777. He became associated with Sir Joseph Banks and, following the death of Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander in 1782, was the librarian of the Royal Society and vice-president of the Linnean Society of London.

Dryander&#x27;s publications included &quot;Catalogus bibliothecae historico-naturalis Josephi Banks&quot; (1796-1800).

In 1784, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

The genus &quot;Dryandra&quot; was named in his honour by his friend and fellow scientist Carl Peter Thunberg (1743–1828) and Robert Brown named &quot;Grevillea dryandri&quot; in his honour.

<text>Judd Asher Nelson (born November 28, 1959) is an American actor. His acting roles include Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime in &quot;The Transformers: The Movie,&quot; John Bender in &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, Alec Newbury in &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;, Alex in &quot;Cybermutt&quot;, Joe Hunt in &quot;Billionaire Boys Club&quot;, Nick Peretti in &quot;New Jack City&quot;, Billy Beretti in &quot;Empire&quot;, and Jack Richmond in the television series &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot;.

== Early life ==
Nelson was born in Portland, Maine, the son of Merle Nelson (), a court mediator and former member of the Maine House of Representatives, and Leonard Nelson, a corporate lawyer. He grew up in a Conservative Jewish home although his family did not keep kosher. His father was the first Jewish president of the Portland Symphony Orchestra. He has two sisters, Eve and Julie.

He went to school at St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire and Waynflete School in Portland, Maine. While at St Paul&#x27;s School, an Episcopalian school, he started embracing his Jewish identity after experiencing antisemitism. He studied at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, leaving during his sophomore year. He subsequently moved to Manhattan to study acting with Stella Adler.

== Career ==
=== 1980s ===
Nelson began acting in the mid-1980s, starring in &quot;Making the Grade&quot; (1984), and in &quot;Fandango&quot; (1985) opposite Kevin Costner. It was his roles in John Hughes&#x27;s &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985) and Joel Schumacher&#x27;s &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; (1985) that made Nelson a star. He was affiliated with the Brat Pack of young 1980s actors, along with Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy. The &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire (Man in Motion)&quot; music video – also directed by Schumacher – reached No. 1 in the US (1985). It was written by David Foster and John Parr and performed by John Parr. Nelson appears in the video. He also appeared on a video for the Simple Minds&#x27; song &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;, from &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, in which members of the &quot;Pack&quot; feature prominently. A subsequent article in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, which focused primarily on the success of these films, resulted in the term &quot;Brat Pack&quot; being coined.

In 1986 Nelson provided the voice of Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime in &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; and teamed up with &quot;Breakfast Club&quot; alumna Ally Sheedy for a third time in &quot;Blue City&quot;. He also provided narration for Bill Couturie&#x27;s &quot;Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam&quot;, a critically acclaimed war documentary that featured a cast including Tom Berenger, Robert De Niro, Willem Dafoe, and Matt Dillon. Film critic Roger Ebert praised the documentary, and it maintains a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

He starred opposite Burt Reynolds in the ABC Afterschool Special &quot;Shattered If Your Kid&#x27;s On Drugs&quot;, which also featured Megan Follows and Dermot Mulroney. In 1987 he starred in the Bob Clark courtroom comedy &quot;From the Hip&quot;, which co-starred John Hurt and Elizabeth Perkins; he also provided a stand-out performance in &quot;Billionaire Boys Club&quot;, a courtroom thriller based on actual events; his performance earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Mini-Series. In late 1988 he played Konstantin in Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; directed by Charles Marowitz at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, earning praise, as did the entire production.

Nelson closed the 1980s with the William Lustig thriller, &quot;Relentless&quot; (1989), in which he plays a Los Angeles serial killer hunted by two police officers (Robert Loggia and Leo Rossi); he provided a cameo in the Adam Rifkin road film &quot;Never on Tuesday&quot; (1989) along with Nicolas Cage, Cary Elwes, Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen; and appeared in Tommy Chong&#x27;s &quot;Far Out Man&quot; (1989) with Rae Dawn Chong and C. Thomas Howell.

Key TV roles in the 1980s included &quot;Moonlighting&quot; (1986) – episode &quot;Camille&quot; – in which he played a police officer opposite Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis.

=== 1990s ===
Nelson began the 1990s with a starring role opposite Max von Sydow in the World War II drama &quot;Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes&quot; (1990). The film focused on the horror of the Hiroshima bombing. It co-stars Mako Iwamatsu and Pat Morita. In the Fall of 1990 he appeared on stage in Chicago and New York in Jules Feiffer&#x27;s &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; with Jon Cryer. He then worked for a second time with Adam Rifkin, this time starring in &quot;The Dark Backward&quot; (1991) with Bill Paxton. This quirky comedy featured fellow actor Rob Lowe, as well as Lara Flynn Boyle, James Caan, and Wayne Newton. Nelson plays the worst comedian in stand-up comedy history.

In 1991, he had a starring role in the Mario Van Peebles-directed &quot;New Jack City&quot;, an urban gangster film with Wesley Snipes, Ice-T, Vanessa A. Williams, and Chris Rock. The film was a commercial success. He then had a special guest appearance in the HBO TV series &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; – on the episode &quot;What&#x27;s Cookin&quot; (1992) – with Christopher Reeve and Meat Loaf, followed by a starring role with Richard Jordan in the thriller &quot;Primary Motive&quot; (1992), and a similar role in &quot;Entangled&quot; (1993) opposite Pierce Brosnan, which was set in Paris.

In 1994 Nelson appeared with Brendan Fraser, Steve Buscemi, Chris Farley, and Adam Sandler in the comedy &quot;Airheads&quot;, with Gina Gershon in the psychological thriller &quot;Flinch&quot;, and with then partner Shannen Doherty in the thriller &quot;Blindfold: Acts of Obsession&quot;. Nelson wrote, produced, and starred in the thriller &quot;Every Breath&quot; in which he co-starred with Joanna Pacula. He headlined the Australian thriller, &quot;Blackwater Trail&quot; (1995), with Peter Phelps. He had a starring role on the NBC television sitcom &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot; (1996), which saw success for a four-season run. He had a starring role in the Shaquille O&#x27;Neal movie &quot;Steel&quot; (1997). The film also starred Annabeth Gish and Richard Roundtree (&quot;Steel&quot; was a commercial flop).

Nelson wrapped up the 1990s with another urban gangster thriller, &quot;Light It Up&quot; (1999), which featured an ensemble cast including R&amp;B singer/actor Usher Raymond (in his first leading role), Rosario Dawson, Forest Whitaker, and Vanessa L. Williams. He played Alan Freed in the latter&#x27;s life story, &quot;Mr. Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll: The Alan Freed Story&quot; (1999) opposite Mädchen Amick and Paula Abdul.

=== 2000s to present day ===
In the 21st century, Nelson has appeared in such TV series as &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; (2000), &quot;&quot; (2006), &quot;&quot; (2007), &quot;Las Vegas&quot; (2007), &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot; (2008) as a psychologist researching soldiers returning from Iraq who suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder, &quot;Psych&quot; (2010), and a recurring role in &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; (2010) with Charlie Sheen.

Films include the psychological thriller &quot;Cabin by the Lake&quot; (2000), its sequel &quot;Return to Cabin by the Lake&quot; (2001), and a cameo appearance in the 2001 film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;; the film&#x27;s writer-director, Kevin Smith, had been a long-time fan of Nelson and the &quot;Brat Pack&quot; films. In 2002 he co-starred with Lauren Holly in &quot;Santa Jr.&quot; and reprised his role as John Bender in an episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot; (2007). Later, Nelson reprised his role of Rodimus Prime in &quot;Transformers Animated&quot; (2009) and appeared in &quot;The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day&quot; (2009), the latter with Julie Benz, Billy Connolly, Sean Patrick Flanery, and Peter Fonda.

He portrayed Father Charley Lock on &quot;Brookwood Sleazebags&quot; (2010), a pilot he did for HBO. In 2012, Nelson played the role of Headmaster Nash in the live-action feature film &quot;Bad Kids Go to Hell&quot;, based on the graphic novel of the same name. The same year, Nelson co-wrote and starred in the short film &quot;The Spin Room: Super Tuesday&quot;. Nelson reprised his role as Rodimus in &quot;&quot; and voiced Ben 10,000, Eon, and Atomic-X in &quot;Ben 10: Omniverse&quot;.

In 2013, Nelson authored four books released on Kindle: &quot;The Power of Speech&quot;, &quot;Nine of Diamonds&quot;, &quot;The Gig&quot;, and &quot;Water Music&quot;.

Nelson played a pivotal role in the final season of &quot;Nikita&quot;.

Nelson played a lead role in the 2010 Hallmark movie, &quot;Cancel Christmas&quot;. He portrayed Chris Frost, who is also Santa Claus.

In 2019, he starred in the suspense thriller, &quot;Dead Water&quot;.

In 2021, Nelson starred as Don Cody in the Lifetime film &quot;Girl in the Basement&quot; which was inspired by the Fritzl case.

The test is an integral part of the law school admission process in the United States, Canada (common law programs only), the University of Melbourne, Australia, and a growing number of other countries.

The test has existed in some form since 1948, when it was created to give law schools a standardized way to assess applicants in addition to their GPA. The current form of the exam has been used since 1991. The exam has four total sections that include three scored multiple choice sections, an unscored experimental section, and an unscored writing section. Raw scores on the exam are transformed into scaled scores, ranging from a high of 180 to a low of 120, with a median score typically around 150. Law school applicants are required to report all scores from the past five years, though schools generally consider the highest score in their admissions decisions.

Before July 2019, the test was administered by paper-and-pencil. In 2019, the test was exclusively administered electronically using a tablet. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the test was administered using the test-taker&#x27;s personal computer. Beginning in 2023, candidates have had the option to take a digital version either at an approved testing center or on their computer at home.

==Function==
The purpose of the LSAT is to aid in predicting student success in law school. Researchers Balin, Fine, and Guinier performed research on the LSAT&#x27;s ability to predict law school grades at the University of Pennsylvania. They found that the LSAT could explain about 14% of the variance in first year grades and about 15% of the variance in second year grades.

== History ==
The LSAT was the result of a 1945 inquiry of Frank Bowles, a Columbia Law School admissions director, about a more satisfactory admissions test that could be used for admissions than the one that was in use in 1945. The goal was to find a test that would correlate with first year grades rather than bar passage rates. This led to an invitation of representatives from Harvard Law School and Yale Law School who ultimately accepted the invitation and began to draft the first administration of the LSAT exam. NYU, in correspondence by memorandum, was openly unconvinced &quot;about the usefulness of an aptitude test as a method of selecting law school students,&quot; but was open to experimenting with the idea, as were other schools that were unconvinced. At a meeting on 10 November 1947, with representatives of law schools extending beyond the original Columbia, Harvard, and Yale representatives, the design of the LSAT was discussed. At this meeting the issue of a way to test students who came from excessively &quot;technical&quot; backgrounds that were deficient in the study of history and literature was discussed but ultimately rejected. The first administration of the LSAT followed and occurred in 1948.

From the test&#x27;s inception until 1981, scores were reported on a scale of 200 to 800; from 1981 to 1991, a 48-point scale was used. In 1991, the scale was changed again, so that reported scores range from 120 to 180.

===Online test===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Law School Admission Council created the LSAT-Flex. The LSAT-Flex is an online proctored test that was first administrated during May 2020. While the normal LSAT test consisted of four sections plus an experimental section (1 section of logic games, 1 section of reading comprehension, 2 sections of logical reasoning, and an additional random section), the LSAT-Flex consists of three sections (1 section of logic games, 1 section of reading comprehension, and 1 section of logical reasoning). Though the LSAT-Flex contains one less section than the normal LSAT test, the LSAT-Flex is scored on the normal 120–180 scale. After June 2021, the name LSAT-Flex was dropped and the test was again referred to as just the LSAT, though the format continued to be used through the testing cycle that ended in June 2022. Beginning with the August 2022 administration, LSAC reintroduced an experimental section, having the test consist of three sections plus an experimental section (1 section of logic games, 1 section of reading comprehension, 1 section of logical reasoning, and an additional random section). The writing section is also administered online.

===Former analytical reasoning section===
Prior to August 2024, the LSAT contained an analytical reasoning section, commonly referred to as logic games. The section was removed following a 2019 legal settlement between the LSAC and two blind LSAT test takers who claimed that the section violated the Americans with Disabilities Act because they were unfairly penalized for not being able to draw the diagrams commonly used to solve the questions in the section. As part of the settlement, the LSAC agreed to review and overhaul the section within four years. In October 2023, it announced that the section would be replaced by a second logical reasoning section in August 2024.

== Administration ==
The LSAC previously administered the LSAT four times per year: June, September/October, December and February. However, in June 2017, it was announced that the LSAC would be increasing the number of tests from four to six, and would instead be administering it in January, March, June, July, September, and November.

There were 129,925 LSATs administered in the 2011–12 testing year (June 2011 – February 2012), the largest percentage decline in LSATs administered in more than 10 years, and a drop of more than 16% from the previous year, when 155,050 LSATs were administered. The number of LSATs administered fell more than 25% over a two-year period (from the 2009–10 testing year to the 2011–12 testing year). The October 2012 administration reflected a 16.4% drop in volume from its 2011 counterpart. LSAT numbers continued to drop over the next two cycles but to a lesser degree, with 13.4% and 6.2% drops, respectively, for the 2012–13 and 2013–14 cycles. February 2014 showed the first increase in test takers (1.1%) since June 2010.

In December 2018, LSAC announced that the Microsoft Surface Go tablet will be used exclusively to administer the LSAT beginning in 2019 when the test transitions to a digital only format. However, following the COVID-19 pandemic, candidates are able to sit for the test remotely with their own computer. The writing sample section will be separate from the LSAT starting with the 3 June 2019 test administration. Candidates will be automatically eligible to complete the writing section as early as 10 days prior to test day and up to one year thereafter. Candidates only need to complete the writing sample section once every 5 years, even if candidates re-test before then.

== Test composition ==
The LSAT consists of four 35-minute multiple-choice sections (one of which is an unscored experimental section) followed by an unscored writing sample section that can be taken separately. Modern tests have 75–76 scored items in total. Several different test forms are used within an administration, each presenting the multiple-choice sections in different orders, which is intended to make it difficult to cheat or to guess which is the experimental section.

=== Logical reasoning ===
As of 2021, the LSAT contains two logical reasoning (&quot;LR&quot;) sections, commonly known as &quot;arguments&quot;, designed to test the taker&#x27;s ability to dissect and analyze arguments. LR sections each contain 24–26 questions. Each question begins with a short argument or set of facts. This is followed by a prompt asking the test taker to find the argument&#x27;s assumption, to select an alternate conclusion to the argument, to identify errors or logical omissions in the argument, to find another argument with parallel reasoning, or to choose a statement that would weaken or strengthen the argument.

In October 2023, the LSAC announced that the analytical reasoning (logic games) section would be replaced by a second logical reasoning section in August 2024 pursuant to the implementation of a 2019 settlement agreement with blind LSAT test takers.

=== Reading comprehension ===
The LSAT contains one reading comprehension (&quot;RC&quot;) section consisting of four passages of 400–500 words, and 5–8 questions relating to each passage. Complete sections contain 26–28 questions. Though no real rules govern the content of this section, the passages generally relate to law, arts and humanities, physical sciences, or social sciences. The questions usually ask the examinee to determine the author&#x27;s main idea, find specific information in the passage, draw inferences from the text, and/or describe the structure of the passage.

In June 2007, one of the four passages was replaced with a &quot;comparative reading&quot; question. Comparative reading presents two shorter passages with differing perspectives on a topic. Parallels exist between the comparative reading question, the SAT&#x27;s critical reading section, and the science section of the ACT.

=== Unscored variable section ===
The current test contains one experimental section which is referred to as the &quot;variable section&quot;. It is used to test new questions for future exams. The performance of the examinee on this section is not reported as part of the final score. The examinee is not told which section of the exam is experimental, since doing so could skew the data. Previously, this section has always been one of the first three sections of any given test, but beginning with the administration of the October 2011 LSAT, the experimental section can be after the first three sections. LSAC makes no specific claim as to which section(s) it has appeared as in the past, and what section(s) it may appear as in the future. 

=== Writing sample ===
The writing sample appears as the final section of the exam. The writing sample is presented in the form of a decision prompt, which provides the examinee with a problem and two criteria for making a decision. The examinee must then write an essay arguing for one of the two options over the other. The decision prompt generally does not involve a controversial subject, but rather something mundane about which the examinee likely has no strong bias. While there is no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; answer to the writing prompt, it is important that the examinee argues for his/her chosen position and also argues against the counter-position.

LSAC does not score the writing sample. Instead, the essay is sent to admission offices along with the LSAT score. Some admissions officers regard the usefulness of the writing sample to be marginal. Additionally, most schools require that applicants submit a &quot;personal statement&quot; of some kind. These factors sometimes result in admission boards disregarding the writing sample. However, only 6.8% of 157 schools surveyed by LSAC in 2006 indicated that they &quot;never&quot; use the writing sample when evaluating an application. In contrast, 9.9% of the schools reported that they &quot;always&quot; use the sample; 25.3% reported that they &quot;frequently&quot; use the sample; 32.7% responded &quot;occasionally&quot;; and 25.3% reported &quot;seldom&quot; using the sample.

== Preparation ==
LSAC recommends advance preparation for the LSAT, due to the importance of the LSAT in law school admissions and because scores on the exam typically correspond to preparation time. The structure of the LSAT and the types of questions asked are generally consistent from year to year, which allows students to practice on question types that show up frequently in examinations.

LSAC suggests, at a minimum, that students review official practice tests, called PrepTests, before test day to familiarize themselves with the types of questions that appear on the exams. LSAC offers four free tests that can be downloaded from their website. For best results, LSAC suggests taking practice tests under actual time constraints and representative conditions in order to identify problem areas to focus on in further review.

For preparation purposes, only tests after June 1991 are considered modern, since the LSAT was significantly modified after this date. Each released exam is commonly referred to as a PrepTest. There are over 90 PrepTests in circulation, the oldest being the June 1991 LSAT numbered as PrepTest 1 and the newest being a July 2020 LSAT numbered as PrepTest 94+. Certain PrepTests are no longer published by LSAC (among them 1–6, 8, 17, 39, and 40), despite the fact that they were in print at one time. However, these tests have been made available through some of the test preparation companies, which have licensed them from LSAC to provide only to students in their courses. For a few years, some prep companies sold digital copies of LSAT PrepTests as PDFs, but LSAC revised its licensing policy in 2016, effectively banning the sale of LSAT PDFs to the general public.

Some students taking the LSAT use a test preparation company. Students who do not use these courses often rely on material from LSAT preparation books, previously administered exams, and internet resources such as blogs, forums, and mobile apps.

== Scoring ==
The LSAT is a standardized test in that LSAC adjusts raw scores to fit an expected norm to overcome the likelihood that some administrations may be more difficult than others. Normalized scores are distributed on a scale with a low of 120 to a high of 180.

The LSAT system of scoring is predetermined and does not reflect test takers&#x27; percentile. The relationship between raw questions answered correctly (the &quot;raw score&quot;) and scaled score is determined before the test is administered, through a process called equating. This means that the conversion standard is set beforehand, and the distribution of percentiles can vary during the scoring of any particular LSAT.

Adjusted scores lie in a bell curve, tapering off at the extremes and concentrating near the median. For example, there might be a 3–5 question difference between a score of 175 and a score of 180, but the difference between a 155 from a 160 could be 9 or more questions—this is because the LSAT uses an ordinal grading system. Although the exact percentile of a given score will vary slightly between examinations, there tends to be little variance. The 50th percentile is typically a score of about 151; the 90th percentile is around 165 and the 99th is about 173. A 178 or better usually places the examinee in the 99.9th percentile.

Examinees have the option of canceling their scores within six calendar days after the exam, before they get their scores. LSAC still reports to law schools that the student registered for and took the exam, but releases no score. Test takers typically receive their scores online between three and four weeks after the exam. There is a formal appeals process for examinee complaints, which has been used for proctor misconduct, peer misconduct, and occasionally for challenging a question. In very rare instances, specific questions have been omitted from final scoring.

University of North Texas economist Michael Nieswiadomy has conducted several studies (in 1998, 2006, and 2008) derived from LSAC data. In the most recent study, Nieswiadomy took the LSAC&#x27;s categorization of test-takers in terms of their undergraduate college and university academic major study areas, and grouped a total of 162 major study areas into 29 categories, finding the averages of each major:
#Mathematics/Physics 160.0
#Economics and Philosophy and Theology (tie) 157.4
#International relations 156.5
#Engineering 156.2
#Government/service 156.1
#Chemistry 156.1
#History 155.9
#Interdisciplinary studies 155.5
#Foreign languages 155.3
#English 155.2
#Biology/natural sciences 154.8
#Arts 154.2
#Computer science 154.0
#Finance 153.4
#Political science 153.1
#Psychology 152.5
#Liberal arts 152.4
#Anthropology/geography 152.2
#Accounting 151.7
#Journalism 151.5
#Sociology/social work 151.2
#Marketing 150.8
#Business management 149.7
#Education 149.4
#Business administration 149.1
#Health professions 148.4
#Pre-law 148.3
#Criminal justice 146.0
== Use of scores in law school admissions ==
The LSAT is considered an important part of the law school admissions process, along with GPA. Many law schools are selective in their decisions to admit students, and the LSAT is one method of differentiating candidates.

Additionally the LSAC says the LSAT (like the SAT and ACT at the undergraduate level) serves as a standardized measure of one&#x27;s ability to succeed during law school. Undergraduate grade points can vary significantly due to choices in course load as well as grade inflation, which may be pervasive at an applicant&#x27;s undergraduate institution, but almost nonexistent at that of another. Some law schools, such as Georgetown University and the University of Michigan have added programs designed to waive the LSAT for selected students who have maintained a 3.8 undergraduate GPA at their schools.

LSAC says its own research supports the use of the LSAT as a major factor in admissions, saying the median validity for LSAT alone is .41 (2001) and .40 (2002) in regard to the first year of law school. The correlation varies from school to school, and LSAC says that test scores are more strongly correlated to first year law school performance than is undergraduate GPA. LSAC says that a more strongly correlated single-factor measure does not currently exist, that GPA is difficult to use because it is influenced by the school and the courses taken by the student, and that the LSAT can serve as a yardstick of student ability because it is statistically normed. However, the American Bar Association has waived the requirement for law schools to use the LSAT as an admission requirement in select cases. This may be due to the fact that an emphasis on LSAT scores is considered by some to be detrimental to the promotion of diversity among applicants. Others argue that it is an attempt by law schools to counteract declining enrollment.

Most admission boards use an admission index, which is a formula that applies different weight to the LSAT and undergraduate GPA and adds the results. This composite statistic can have a weaker correlation to first year performance than either GPA or LSAT score alone, depending on the weighting used. The amount of weight assigned to LSAT score versus undergraduate GPA varies from school to school, as almost all law programs employ a different admission index formula.

=== Multiple scores ===
Starting in September 2019, students may take the LSAT up to three times in a single LSAC year (1 June – 31 May), up to five times within the current and five past testing years (the period in which LSAC reports scores to law schools), and up to seven times over a lifetime. These restrictions will not apply retroactively; tests taken prior to September 2019 do not count toward a student&#x27;s totals. Also, LSAC will implement an appeals process to grant exceptions to these restrictions under extenuating circumstances. Furthermore, starting in September 2019, no student who has obtained a perfect LSAT score of 180 within the current and five past testing years will be allowed to take the LSAT. This rule, unlike the other new rules, &quot;will&quot; be retroactive: a score of 180 obtained prior to September 2019 (but within the past five years) will preclude another attempt.

Between 2017 and July 2019, students could take the LSAT as many times as it was offered. Prior to 2017, only three attempts were allowed in a two-year period.

Every score within five years is reported to law schools during the application process, as well a separate average of all scores on record. When faced with multiple scores from repeat test takers, users of standardized assessments typically employ three indices—most recent, highest, and average scores—in order to summarize an individual’s related performance.

How the law schools report the LSAT scores of their matriculants to the American Bar Association (ABA) has changed over the years. In June 2006, the ABA revised a rule that mandated law schools to report their matriculants&#x27; average score if more than one test was taken. The current ABA rule now requires law schools to report only the highest LSAT score for matriculants who took the test more than once. In response, many law schools began considering only the highest LSAT score during the admissions process, as the highest score is an important factor in law school rankings such as those published by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Many students rely heavily upon the rankings when deciding where to attend law school.

== Use of scores in admissions to intellectual clubs ==
High LSAT scores are accepted as qualifying evidence for intellectual clubs such as American Mensa, Intertel, the Triple Nine Society and the International Society for Philosophical Enquiry. The minimum scores they require depend on the selectivity of each society and time period when the test was administered. After 1982, Mensa has required students to score in the 95+ percentile rank on the LSAT for membership, while Intertel has required an LSAT score of 172 for admission since 1994, and Triple Nine has required an LSAT score of 173 for acceptance since 1991.

== Fingerprinting controversy ==
Starting October 1973, those taking the LSAT were required to have fingerprints taken, after some examinees were found to have hired impostors to take the test on their behalf.

A controversy surrounding the LSAT was the requirement that examinees submit to fingerprinting on the day of testing. Although LSAC does not store digital representations of fingerprints, there is a concern that fingerprints might be accessible by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. At the behest of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, the LSAC implemented a change as of September 2007 which exempts Canadian test takers from the requirement to provide a fingerprint and instead requires that Canadian test-takers provide a photograph. Starting with the June 2011 admission of the LSAT, LSAC expanded this policy to include test-takers in the United States and Caribbean; LSAC therefore no longer requires fingerprints from any test takers, and instead requires that they submit a photograph.

== LSAT─India ==
LSAC started administering the LSAT for Indian law schools in 2009. The test is administered twice a year by a Pearson on behalf of LSAC. There are around 1300 law schools in India, however LSAT─India scores are accepted by only about 10-15 private law schools in the country. These scores are not accepted anywhere else in South Asia, and as a result participation in the LSAT─India has been low.

<doc id="386329" wikidata="Q650573" url="?curid=386329" title="Ira D. Sankey">
<text>Ira David Sankey (August 28, 1840 – August 13, 1908) was an American gospel singer and composer, known for his long association with Dwight L. Moody in a series of religious revival campaigns in America and Britain during the closing decades of the 19th century. Sankey was a pioneer in the introduction of a musical style that influenced church services and evangelical campaigns for generations, and the hymns that he wrote or popularized continued to be sung well into the 21st century.

Sankey, born in Pennsylvania, was an amateur singer and church worker when he was recruited by Moody in 1870 after the latter heard him sing at a convention. Until Moody died in 1899 the two campaigned together, Moody preaching while Sankey sang both old and new hymns, inspired by writers such as Fanny Crosby and Philip Bliss. Sankey also became a prolific composer of hymn tunes, and a compiler and editor of popular hymn collections, in particular &quot;Sacred Songs and Solos&quot; and &quot;Gospel Hymns and Sacred Songs&quot;. The proceeds from these publishing ventures were used for a range of charitable purposes.

After Moody&#x27;s death, Sankey attempted to carry on the work alone but was defeated by ill-health and the eventual loss of his eyesight. He died in 1908. He was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1980.

==Life==
===Background and early years===
Sankey was born in Edinburg, Pennsylvania, on August 28, 1840, one of nine children of David Sankey and his wife Mary Leeper Sankey. The family&#x27;s ancestry was English on the father&#x27;s side and a mix of Scottish and Irish on the mother&#x27;s. David Sankey was a banker, a former state senator and a Methodist lay preacher. As a young boy Ira displayed a love of music that was encouraged by his parents, who typically spent evenings with him at home, singing hymns. At the age of eight, he began attending Sunday school.

When he was 19, Ira underwent an experience of religious conversion at a revivalist meeting held at a nearby church, King&#x27;s Chapel. A year later the family moved to New Castle, where the young Sankey joined the local Methodist Episcopal Church. His enthusiasm and talents were quickly recognized and led to his appointment as Sunday school superintendent and choirmaster.

In 1861, at the start of the American Civil War, Sankey answered President Lincoln&#x27;s call for volunteers and joined the Twelfth Pennsylvania Regiment. He served between 1861 and 1863. In the army he continued his religious and singing activities, forming a choir and assisting the chaplain. When his period of enlistment was over he returned to New Castle, where his father had been appointed by Lincoln as a Collector of Internal Revenue. In 1863 Sankey joined his father in government service and, that same year, married Fanny Edwards, a member of his choir.

===With Dwight L. Moody===
====Early campaigns====
Back in New Castle, Sankey developed a local reputation as a singer, much in demand in churches and revival meetings. In 1867, when a local branch of YMCA was formed, Sankey became its secretary and later its president. As president, in 1870 he was a delegate at a national conference held in Indianapolis, where he encountered the noted preacher Dwight L. Moody for the first time. Moody was instantly impressed as Sankey demonstrated his ability to enliven an audience rendered soporific by inactivity and overlong prayers by giving an impromptu rendering of the hymn &quot;There is a fountain filled with blood&quot;. Meeting Sankey at the end of the session, Moody demanded that the young man join him in his mission work: &quot;I have been looking for you for the last eight years&quot;. Unable to decide on the spur of the moment, Sankey returned to New Castle and pondered Moody&#x27;s challenge for six months before deciding to return to Chicago for a week&#x27;s trial with Moody. Before the week was up he resigned his government post and threw in his lot with Moody&#x27;s mission, thus beginning their lifelong partnership.

Within the Moody–Sankey mission, Moody preached and Sankey sang. Late in 1871, mission work was interrupted by the Great Chicago Fire, which destroyed 18,000 buildings, killed around 300 people, and left a third of the city&#x27;s population homeless. Sankey watched the conflagration from a small boat in which he rowed out into Lake Michigan. The fire destroyed Moody&#x27;s church, and Sankey returned temporarily to New Castle. However, he soon received a message from Moody asking him to come back to Chicago and resume the partnership. He did so and worked with Moody in the revival of churches in Chicago, Springfield and elsewhere. In October 1872 Sankey moved his family permanently to Chicago.

====British campaign 1873–1875 and aftermath====
Moody made plans to visit the British Isles in 1873 for a series of missions. He did not initially intend to take Sankey as his musical associate, preferring the services of the more experienced gospel singers Philip Phillips or Philip Bliss. Neither was available, so Sankey was taken. The tour got off to a slow start; barely 50 people attended the first rally, held in York, and this congregation was unused to the kind of gospel songs – &quot;human hymns&quot; – that Sankey introduced. Gradually, however, the British public was won over, halls were filled, and Sankey&#x27;s &quot;singing the gospel&quot; became a popular feature of the services. To familiarise the congregations with the words of new hymns by Bliss, Fanny Crosby and others, Sankey published a short collection of the favorite numbers, under the title &quot;Sacred Songs and Solos&quot;. The collection was much expanded in later editions, eventually comprising 1,200 pieces. While in Scotland, Sankey composed his first gospel song, a setting of Horatius Bonar&#x27;s hymn &quot;Yet There is Room&quot;. The tour extended over two years, with meetings in most of the main British cities. When it reached London, congregations included many of the most prominent in the land, including Queen Victoria, the Princess of Wales, and the statesman William Ewart Gladstone.

Moody and Sankey returned home in the summer of 1875, to considerable acclaim after their successful British tour, and quickly established themselves as the leading revivalists of their times. Beginning with a rally in Moody&#x27;s hometown of Northfield, Massachusetts, revival meetings were held during the following years in towns and cities the length and breadth of the United States, with excursions over the borders into Canada and Mexico. Meetings in the southern states were subject to racial segregation. Concerning a meeting in Meridian, Mississippi, Sankey noted: &quot;we have one side of the [tabernacle] for blacks. D.L. has them sing alone, sometimes just to show the white people how to sing&quot;.

====Later campaigns====
The campaign made a second visit to Britain in 1881. The schedule was similar to that which had been followed on the first British tour, involving mass rallies in a large number of cities. This time, the pair&#x27;s popularity and renown assured them of full houses wherever they went. One innovation was the construction of a portable tabernacle, capable of seating up to 5,000 people, which was transported from city to city. Towards the end of the tour Sankey&#x27;s voice broke down and he was forced to return to the United States, where he and his family bought a house in Brooklyn, New York. For the next few years, he spent his winters there and the summers with Moody, either in Northfield or on campaigns. A third British tour took place in 1891, involving meetings in 99 towns. Again, Sankey overstrained himself and had to return home early.

In 1893 Moody and Sankey conducted a major campaign in Chicago, as part of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. Once more the strain on Sankey&#x27;s voice was too great, causing his temporary withdrawal. But despite ill health he continued to work with Moody, at a lower degree of intensity, until the time of the latter&#x27;s death in December 1899. Their final campaign together was in Kansas City, a month before Moody&#x27;s death. As a tribute to his long-time partner, Sankey wrote and composed the hymn &quot;Out of the Shadowlands&quot; for Moody&#x27;s funeral.

===Final years and death===
In 1898, accompanied by family and friends, Sankey traveled to Egypt and Palestine on an extended trip which, on the return journey, included visits to Constantinople, Athens and Rome. In Jerusalem, Sankey ascended the Tower of David, where he sang Psalm 121 to a bemused Ottoman guard. The following year, after Moody&#x27;s death, he embarked on his final visit to Britain and addressed a meeting of 20,000 in London, but as the tour progressed his health failed him and he returned to his home in Brooklyn. He continued to do editorial work, but by 1903 he had lost his eyesight to glaucoma. Despite this, he managed to complete a book of memoirs, &quot;My Life and Sacred Songs&quot;, which was published in 1906. Sankey died at Brooklyn on August 13, 1908, just short of his 68th birthday. His funeral took place at the LaFayette Avenue Presbyterian Church, which he had joined in his final years, and he was buried in Brooklyn&#x27;s Greenwood Cemetery. At Fanny Sankey&#x27;s request a memorial window, depicting &quot;The Ninety and Nine&quot;, was placed in New Castle&#x27;s First Methodist Church; the window was retained when the church was rebuilt in the 1990s.

==Appraisal==
===Musical ministry===
====Singing====
In Sankey&#x27;s view, he and Moody were both preachers; the only difference, he said, was that &quot;[Moody] reaches men&#x27;s hearts with words that are spoken, while I reach them with words that are sung.&quot; Sankey lacked formal voice training; the only tuition that he received was likely during his attendance at a 12-week session run by George Frederick Root, Lowell Mason, and William Bradbury, which prepared potential music teachers and choirmasters for their work. Nevertheless, he possessed a sound vocal technique; a contemporary description refers to &quot;an exceptionally strong baritone&quot;, while a newspaper review of the times wrote that &quot;he expresses the gospel message with exquisite skill and pathos ... but the secret of Mr. Sankey&#x27;s power lies not in his gift of the song but in the spirit of which the song is only the expression&quot;. According to Sankey: &quot;Before I sing, I must feel, and the hymn must be of such kind as I know I can send home what I feel into the hearts of those who listen&quot;. His technique for communicating this feeling involved the clearest possible enunciation, with careful use of pauses for dramatic effect: &quot;You&#x27;ve got to make them hear every word and see every picture ... Then you&#x27;ll get that silence of death, that quiet before God&quot;.

For his solos, Sankey would accompany himself on a small portable reed organ. An important part of the song ministry was the congregational singing, always a significant feature of campaign meetings. Sankey chose hymns with accessible tunes that were easy to learn and insisted that the accompanying music be played softly, to emphasize the message of the words. Sankey&#x27;s methods had a marked effect on church music and were widely adopted by later generations of revivalist singers.

In the secular world, not every listener was captivated by Sankey&#x27;s singing style. A.N. Wilson, in his social history of the Victorian era, quotes a contemporary pamphlet from an anonymous &quot;London Physician&quot; which is dismissive of both Moody and Sankey. Having characterized Moody as a ranter and &quot;a third-rate star&quot;, the writer goes on: &quot;As for Mr. Sankey ... his voice is decidedly bad, and, like all worn-out singers he endeavors to conceal this by startling alternations of high and low notes&quot;. Against this judgment is that of a newspaper published towards the end of the first British tour: &quot;Music in his hands is ... the handmaid of the gospel and the voice of the heart.&quot;

====Composing====
Sankey began to compose hymn tunes during the first Moody-Sankey tour of Britain in 1873–1875. On a few occasions he wrote his own words, but more commonly he used verses provided by well-known hymn writers. The &quot;1200&quot; version of &quot;Sacred Songs and Solos&quot; includes nearly 200 of Sankey&#x27;s settings of hymns by writers such as Horatius Bonar, Fanny Crosby, Elizabeth C. Clephane, Robert Lowry, John Greenleaf Whittier, Frances Ridley Havergal and many others. These hymns include &quot;The Ninety and Nine&quot;, &quot;Beneath the Cross of Jesus&quot;, &quot;Hiding in Thee&quot;, &quot;A Shelter in the Time of Storm&quot; and &quot;While the days are going by&quot;.

Sankey&#x27;s settings are eminently recognizable, characteristic features being simple melodies combined with strong and vigorous rhythms that reflected the popular music of the time, and which according to the British poet John Betjeman, invoked &quot;that well-known principle of denying the devil all the best tunes&quot;. His compositional method was heavily dependent upon what he termed &quot;inspiration&quot;; he carried a notebook in which he would jot down snatches of melody that came to him during the day&#x27;s activities, and would develop them later when time allowed. Sometimes he would improvise a melody; one of his best-known hymns, &quot;The Ninety and Nine&quot;, was composed in this way. He found Elizabeth Clephane&#x27;s poem in a newspaper while traveling on a train in Scotland during the first British tour. At the meeting that evening, when Moody requested that he sing, &quot;I had nothing suitable in mind ... At this moment I seemed to hear a voice saying &quot;Sing the hymn you found on the train&quot;: 
====Publishing====
The publishing successes in Britain with &quot;Sacred Songs and Solos&quot; prompted Sankey to make a similar venture in the United States. In 1876, in collaboration with Bliss, he published a gospel song collection &quot;Gospel Hymns and Sacred Songs&quot;, consisting of 131 numbers. Over the next 15 years, working with various associates, he produced five supplements to this work, and a complete edition of all six parts in 1894, this last containing 794 numbers. These collections, which included the hymns of Bliss, Crosby and many other writers, were very successful commercially. In 1895 Sankey assumed the presidency of Biglow &amp; Main, America&#x27;s leading publisher of Sunday school music.

===Legacy===
Sankey&#x27;s career as a gospel singer contradicts the commonly held assumption that gospel music originated within the black communities in the southern states. Rather, as Mel R. Wilhoit points out, its source is found &quot;in the context of Northern, urban, white revivalism of the nineteenth century&quot; in which Sankey was a principal figure. Although new musical idioms developed in the later 20th century and subsequently, Sankey&#x27;s influence persists, particularly in southern evangelical churches, well into the 21st century. The revivalist model that Moody and Sankey introduced established a paradigm for the conduct of rallies and services in evangelical churches for generations.

From the sales of his various hymn collections, which totaled over 50 million copies, Sankey acquired a considerable fortune, much of which he used for benefactions. These included a new YMCA building in New Castle, a building plot for the erection of a new Methodist Episcopal Church there, and large donations to the Moody schools in Northfields.

The centenary of Sankey&#x27;s birth was celebrated in New Castle in 1940. Choirs from over 30 churches participated, and Sankey&#x27;s portable organ was used as accompaniment. The 150th anniversary of his birth in 1990 was also marked in New Castle, where massed choirs performed a retrospective of Sankey&#x27;s songs. In 1980 Sankey was honored by induction into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame.

<doc id="386340" wikidata="Q3052147" url="?curid=386340" title="San Francisco Bowl">
<text>The San Francisco Bowl was an annual postseason college football bowl game certified by the NCAA and played in the San Francisco Bay Area. Originally named the Diamond Walnut San Francisco Bowl during its first two editions from 2002 to 2003, it was the Emerald Bowl from 2004 to 2009, the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl from 2010 to 2013, the Foster Farms Bowl from 2014 to 2017, and the Redbox Bowl from 2018 to 2020. San Francisco Bowl naming returned during planning for a 2021 game.

The game had four sellouts—2006 (UCLA vs. Florida State), 2008 (Cal vs. Miami), 2009 (USC vs. Boston College), and 2011 (Nevada vs. Boston College)—and three of the highest rated bowls ever televised on ESPN. It also gained a national reputation for the quality of hospitality provided to the participating teams.

The game was most recently played in December 2019. From 2002 to 2013, it was played at Pacific Bell Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, in San Francisco, California. From 2014 through 2019, it was played at Levi&#x27;s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers, in Santa Clara, California.

At the end of July 2020, organizers canceled the 2020 edition of the bowl due to the COVID-19 pandemic; at the same time, the 49ers released a statement noting that &quot;the decision has been made to not renew the current agreement to host the game moving forward&quot;. On September 10, 2021, the game was again canceled for the 2021–22 bowl season, putting its future in jeopardy.

==History==
The game was founded by John Marks, president of the San Francisco Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, San Francisco Giants executive Pat Gallagher and sports industry veteran Gary Cavalli, former Associate Athletic Director at Stanford University and president of the pioneering American Basketball League, for the purpose of utilizing the Giants&#x27; new ballpark, bringing visitors to San Francisco during a traditionally slow time of the year, and rewarding two successful teams with a week in San Francisco. 
Plans for the inaugural 2002 San Francisco Bowl were established on Dec. 2, 2002, when the Air Force Falcons football program accepted a bid to play against an undetermined team from the Big East Conference. Their initial sponsor was Diamond Foods, a producer of walnuts and other nuts under the Emerald brand name, resulting in the name Diamond Walnut San Francisco Bowl, and later the Emerald Bowl.

In 2010, Kraft Foods became the sponsor of the bowl and announced the new name, which the corporation launched as part of a broader hunger relief program. Mondelēz International continued to support the game and the program related with Feeding America in 2013.

In August 2014, the bowl&#x27;s official website listed the game&#x27;s name as the San Francisco Bowl once again. However, on November 11, 2014, it was announced that the San Francisco Bowl Game Association had reached a multi-year naming rights deal with Northern California-based poultry company Foster Farms, resulting in the game being named the Foster Farms Bowl.

On July 12, 2016, the San Francisco 49ers NFL team announced that it had taken over management of the Foster Farms Bowl from the San Francisco Bowl Game Association, and also announced a new, four-year broadcast rights deal with Fox Sports, replacing ESPN.

In September 2018, Redbox (a chain of video rental kiosks) announced it had become the new title sponsor.

==Conference tie-ins==
The game had a contract to host the Pac-12&#x27;s sixth-place team during the 2010 through 2013 seasons. There were multiple contracts that determined the opponent. In 2011, the Pac-12 team&#x27;s opponent was Illinois, replacing Army, which did not achieve bowl eligibility; in 2012, it was Navy; and in 2013, it was BYU. Had these teams not qualified for bowl eligibility, they would have been replaced by teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) or the Mid-American Conference (MAC).

Beginning with the 2014 season, teams come from the Pac-12 and Big Ten conferences. With Oregon&#x27;s appearance in the 2018 edition, Colorado and Washington State are the only Pac-12 members who have not appeared in the game.

==Field configuration==
Because Pacific Bell Park (as it was named when it first hosted the bowl) is a baseball park and not normally used for football, arrangement of the field required both teams to be on the same sideline (southeast), separated by a barrier at the 50-yard line (in shallow right-center field). The opposite sideline (northwest) ran along the third base line, with an end zone near the first base dugout, and the other near the left field wall. Primary seating was in the third base grandstand, with temporary bleacher seating in right-center field.

==Results==
Rankings are based on the AP Poll prior to the game being played.

<doc id="386341" wikidata="Q1507714" url="?curid=386341" title="George Kennan (explorer)">
<text>George Kennan (February 16, 1845 – May 10, 1924) was an American explorer noted for his travels in the Kamchatka and Caucasus regions of the Russian Empire. He was a cousin twice removed of the American diplomat and historian George F. Kennan, whose birthday he shared.

==Early life==
George Kennan was born in Norwalk, Ohio, and was keenly interested in travel from an early age. However, family finances made him begin work at the Cleveland and Toledo Railroad Company telegraph office at 12.

==Career==
In 1864, he secured employment with the Russian–American Telegraph Company to survey a route for a proposed overland telegraph line through Siberia and across the Bering Strait. Having spent two years in the wilds of Kamchatka, he returned to Ohio via Saint Petersburg and soon became well known by his lectures, articles, and a book about his travels.

In his book &quot;Tent Life in Siberia&quot;, Kennan provided ethnographies, histories and descriptions of many native peoples in Siberia, that are still important for researchers. They include stories about the Koraks (modern spelling: Koryaks), Kamchatdal (Itelmens), Chookchees (Chukchis), Yookaghirs (Yukaghirs), Chooances (Chuvans), Yakoots (Yakuts) and Gakouts. During 1870, he returned to St. Petersburg and travelled to Dagestan, in the northern Caucasus region, which had been annexed by the Russian Empire only ten years previously. There, he became the first American to explore its highlands, a remote Muslim region of herders, silversmiths, carpet-weavers and other craftsmen. 
 He travelled onward through the northern Caucasus area, stopping in Samashki and Grozny, before returning once more to America in 1871. These travels earned him a reputation as an &quot;expert&quot; on all matters pertaining to Russia.

Kennan subsequently (1878) obtained a position with the Associated Press based in Washington, D.C., and as a war correspondent travelled throughout his career to many conflict areas of the world. He also contributed articles to magazines, such as &quot;Century Magazine&quot;, &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (a muckraker magazine), &quot;National Geographic&quot; and &quot;The Outlook&quot;. He was the first Corresponding Secretary for the &quot;National Geographic Society&quot; upon its founding in 1888. 

In May 1885, Kennan began another voyage in Russia, this time across Siberia from Europe. He had been very publicly positive about the Tsarist Russian government and its policies and his journey was approved by the Russian government. However, in the course of his meetings with exiled dissidents during his travel, notably Nikolai Mikhailovich Yadrintsev (1842–1894), Kennan changed his mind about the Russian imperial system. He had been particularly impressed by Catherine Breshkovsky, the populist &quot;little grandmother of the Russian Revolution.&quot; She had bidden him farewell in the small Transbaikal village to which she was confined by saying, &quot;We may die in exile and our grand children may die in exile, but something will come of it at last.&quot; He also met a teenage Leonid Krasin during this journey.

On his return to the United States in August 1886, he became an ardent critic of the Russian autocracy and began to espouse the cause of Russian democracy. Kennan devoted much of the next twenty years to promoting the cause of a Russian revolution, mainly by lecturing. Kennan was one of the most prolific lecturers of the late 19th century. He spoke before a million or so people during the 1890s, including two hundred consecutive evening appearances during 1890–91 (excepting Sundays) before crowds of as many as 2000 people. His reports on conditions in Siberia were published serially by &quot;Century Magazine&quot;, and in 1891, he published a two-volume book &quot;Siberia and The Exile System&quot;. It, with first-hand interviews, data, and drawings by the artist George Albert Frost, had an influential effect on American public opinion.

Kennan befriended other émigrés as well, such as Peter Kropotkin and Sergei Kravchinskii. He became the best-known member of the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom, whose membership included Mark Twain and Julia Ward Howe, and also helped found &quot;Free Russia&quot;, the first English-language journal to oppose Tsarist Russia. In 1901, the Russian government responded by banning him from Russia.

Kennan was not completely consumed by Russian matters. As a reporter and war correspondent, he also covered American politics, the Spanish–American War, the assassination of President William McKinley, and the Russo-Japanese War, as well as World War I and the Russian Revolution. He also published a book, &quot;E. H. Harriman&#x27;s Far Eastern Plans&quot;, (1917, The Country Life Press) about Harriman&#x27;s efforts to secure a lease to the South Manchuria Railway from Japan, as well as &quot;The Chicago and Alton Case: A Misunderstood Transaction&quot;, (1916, The Country Life Press), defending Harriman&#x27;s purchase of the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad from politically motivated criticism by the ICC and Teddy Roosevelt.

Kennan was vehemently against the October Revolution because he felt the Bolsheviks lacked the &quot;knowledge, experience, or education to deal successfully with the tremendous problems that have come up for solutions since the overthrow of the Tsar.&quot; President Woodrow Wilson read and weighed Kennan&#x27;s report in 1918 criticizing the Bolsheviks, but Kennan eventually criticized Wilson&#x27;s administration for being too timid in intervening against Bolshevism.

Kennan&#x27;s last criticism of Bolshevism was written in the &quot;Medina Tribune&quot;, a small-town newspaper, in July 1923:
==Death==
Kennan died at his home in Medina, New York, on May 10, 1924, and was buried in Boxwood Cemetery.

<text>Anti-folk (sometimes spelled antifolk) is a music genre that emerged in the 1980s in New York City, founded by the musician, author and comedian Lach, as a reaction to the commercialization of folk music. It is characterized by its DIY ethos, unconventional songwriting, and often humorous or satirical lyrics. Antifolk music was made to mock the perceived seriousness of the era&#x27;s mainstream music scene, and artists aim to protest with their mocking and clever lyrics.

==History==
===In the United States===
Antifolk was introduced by artists who were unable to obtain gigs at established folk venues in Greenwich Village such as Folk City and The Speakeasy. In the mid-1980s, singer-songwriter Lach started The Fort, an after-hours club on NYC&#x27;s Rivington Street in the Lower East Side. The Fort&#x27;s opening coincided with the New York Folk Festival. Because of this, Lach dubbed his event the New York Antifolk Festival. Other early proponents of the movement included the Washington Squares, Cindy Lee Berryhill, Brenda Kahn, Paleface, Beck, Hamell on Trial, Michelle Shocked, Zane Campbell, John S. Hall, Roger Manning, Kirk Kelly, and Block.

The original Fort was shut down in 1985 by the police, and because of this the club moved locations several times, including East Village bars Sophie&#x27;s and Chameleon, before settling in the back room of the SideWalk Cafe starting in 1993. The New York Antifolk Festival was held annually at the SideWalk Cafe until its closure in 2019 (long outlasting the original Folk Festival). Events have also taken place in the band shells in Tompkins Square Park and Central Park. While living in San Francisco in the early 1990s, Lach helped establish a West Coast anti-folk movement at the Sacred Grounds Coffee House.

Other artists to have achieved a notable level of success who have been considered anti-folk include Jeffrey Lewis, Regina Spektor and the Moldy Peaches.

===In Britain===

In the 2000s the term was adopted in Britain, particularly in the London underground scene, with acts including David Cronenberg&#x27;s Wife and The Bobby McGee&#x27;s. The UK antifolk scene, largely centred in London and Brighton, has established its own identity, which was written about in a six-page feature in the September 2007 issue of &quot;Plan B&quot; magazine. In 2004 the lo-fi musician Filthy Pedro started seasonal anti-folk festivals, which he promoted with Tom Mayne of the band David Cronenberg&#x27;s Wife. An anti-folk scene in Brighton, curated primarily by Mertle, was quick to follow that of London.

Other key figures within the UK anti-folk community include Dan Treacy of Television Personalities, Jack Hayter, Milk Kan, Extradition Order, Benjamin Shaw, Lucy Joplin, Candythief, JJ Crash, Larry Pickleman and Paul Hawkins. Emmy the Great and Laura Marling were added to the roster of antifolk artists as they play antifolk music with mocking lyrics. Kate Nash started her music career playing anti-folk-style shows, including a concert promoted by Larry Pickleman and Mertle in Brighton.

Dan Willson, who performs under the name Withered Hand, is an Edinburgh-based musician often considered part of the genre. His first studio album, &quot;Good News&quot;, was released in 2009.

Welsh antifolk artist Mr Duke has gained some popularity in Wales, and Crywank, an antifolk project from Manchester, surfaced in 2009.

<text>Rotherham United Football Club, nicknamed The Millers, is a professional association football club based in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. The team will compete in EFL League One in the 2024–25 season after suffering relegation from EFL Championship in the previous season. The club&#x27;s colours were initially yellow and black, but changed to red and white around 1930. They have played home matches at the New York Stadium since 2012, having briefly moved to the Don Valley Stadium from their original home at Millmoor in 2008.

The club was formed as a merger between Rotherham County and Rotherham Town in 1925 and were immediately placed in the Football League. They won promotion as champions of the Third Division North in 1950–51 and were beaten finalists in the inaugural League Cup final in 1961, losing to Aston Villa 3–2 on aggregate. After seventeen seasons in the Second Division, relegations followed in 1968 and 1973. Promotion from the Fourth Division was secured in 1974–75 and the club went on to win the Third Division title in 1980–81. Relegations in 1983 and 1988 gave Rotherham the opportunity to win the Fourth Division title in 1988–89, though they had to win another promotion in 1991–92 following relegation the previous season. They beat Shrewsbury Town 2–1 in the 1996 final of the Football League Trophy.

Under the stewardship of Ronnie Moore, Rotherham secured back-to-back promotions in 1999–2000 and 2000–01. They stayed in the second tier for four seasons, though were relegated twice in three years by 2007. The club again secured back-to-back promotions, this time under Steve Evans, securing automatic promotion from League Two in 2012–13 and promotion from League One via the play-offs in 2013–14. The club have moved between the Championship and League One for six successive seasons between 2016–17 and 2021–22, winning the play-offs in 2018 as well as the 2022 EFL Trophy final.

== History ==


The club&#x27;s roots go back to 1877, when the club was formed as Thornhill Football Club (later Thornhill United). George Cook was the trainer around this time. For many years the leading team in the area was Rotherham Town, who spent three seasons in the Football League while Thornhill United were still playing in the Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire League. By the turn of the century, however, Town had resigned from the Football League and gone out of business; a new club of the same name later joined the Midland League. Meanwhile, Thornhill&#x27;s fortunes were on the rise to the extent that in 1905 they laid claim to being the pre-eminent club in the town and changed their name to Rotherham County. For a period both clubs competed in the Midland League, finishing first and second in 1911–12. Rotherham County became members of the second division of the Football league in 1919 whilst Rotherham Town failed to become elected to the third division northern section the following year. By 1925 County&#x27;s fortunes had declined and they had to seek re-election to the third division. By this time it had become clear that to have two professional clubs in the town was not sustainable. Talks had begun in February 1925 and in early May the two clubs merged to form Rotherham United. Days later the reformed club was formally re-elected to the Football League under its new name.

The red and white kit was adopted around 1930 after playing in amber and black, but there was no improvement in the club&#x27;s fortunes: in 1931 they again had to apply for re-election. Immediately after the Second World War things looked up. The Millers won the only post-war edition of the Football League Third Division North Cup in 1946 beating Chester 5–4 on aggregate. They then finished as runners-up three time in succession between 1947 and 1949 and then were champions of Division Three (North) in 1951. Rotherham reached their highest ever league position of third in the Football League Second Division in 1955, when only goal average denied them a place in the top flight after they finished level on points with champions Birmingham City and runners-up Luton Town. During that season they had notable results including a 6–1 win over Liverpool. In 1961 the Millers beat Aston Villa 2–0 at Millmoor in the inaugural League Cup final first leg; they lost the second leg 3–0 however at Villa Park. The second leg was played the season after due to Villa having a &#x27;Congested Fixture List&#x27;. The club held on to its place in Division Two until 1968 and then went into a decline that took them down to Division Four in 1973. In 1975 they were promoted back to the Third Division finishing in the 3rd promotion spot in the Fourth Division. The Millers won the Division Three title in the 1980–81 season, and missed out on a second consecutive promotion by four points, finishing seventh In the second tier (then Division 2) 1981–82. They have not finished this high since. This season also saw Rotherham accomplish their highest-scoring second-tier league double, beating Chelsea 6–0 at home (31 October 1981) and 4–1 away at Stamford Bridge (20 March 1982).

During the 1990s Rotherham were promoted and relegated between the Football League&#x27;s lowest two divisions and they slipped into the Fourth Division in 1991, just two years after being promoted, but reclaimed their status in the third tier (renamed Division Two for the 1992–93 season due to the launch of the FA Premier League) by finishing third in the Fourth Division in 1992. They survived at this level for five years, never looking like promotion contenders, before being relegated in 1997. In 1996 Rotherham United made their first trip to Wembley, beating Shrewsbury 2–1 to win the Football League Trophy, with two goals from Nigel Jemson giving Rotherham the win, with over 20,000 Rotherham United fans following them. In 1997, just after relegation to Division Three, Ronnie Moore took charge of Rotherham United. His first season ended in a mid-table finish and then his second in a play-off semi-final defeat on penalties to Leyton Orient. In 1999–2000 as Rotherham finished as Division Three runners-up and gained promotion to Division Two, where they finished runners-up and won a second successive promotion.

Rotherham managed to remain in Division One for four seasons, and after relegation to League One in 2005, Mick Harford took over as the Millers&#x27; manager, but was sacked after a run of 17 games without a win. Harford was replaced by youth team coach, Alan Knill. Early in 2006 it was announced that the club faced an uncertain future unless a funding gap in the region of £140,000 per month could be plugged. An intervention at the latest possible time by a consortium of local businessmen kept them in business. The final match of the 2005–06 season, home to Milton Keynes Dons, was a winner-take-all relegation showdown where a scoreless draw kept Rotherham up. Rotherham United began their second successive year in League One with a 10-point deficit as a result of the CVA which saved the club from liquidation. The club initially pulled the points back but, after losing key playmaker Lee Williamson and star striker Will Hoskins in the January transfer window, the Millers sat 13 points adrift of safety, making the threat of relegation inevitable. This resulted in Knill being sacked on 1 March, with Mark Robins becoming caretaker manager.

Robins&#x27;s position was made permanent on 6 April 2007, but he was not able to save Rotherham from relegation. The Millers spent the majority of the 2007–08 season in the automatic promotion places but in mid-March 2008 it was revealed that Rotherham had again entered administration and would be deducted 10 points. Local businessman Tony Stewart then took over as chairman for the 2008–09 season and took the club out of administration via a Creditors Voluntary Agreement, resulting in a 17-point deduction. The Millers were subsequently forced to leave Millmoor, their home of over 100 years, for the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield, after disputes with the landlords. The Millers had a successful season under the new regime, wiping out the point deficit and being in contention for a play-off place. Rotherham were also involved in two cup runs, reaching the Football League Trophy Northern Final and the League Cup last 16. This included victories over higher league opposition in the form of Wolverhampton Wanderers, Southampton, Sheffield Wednesday, Leicester City and Leeds United.

Mark Robins kept the majority of the team together from the 2008–09 campaign, whilst bolstering his squad with high calibre signings in the form of Nicky Law and the prolific goalscorer Adam Le Fondre. The 2009–10 season started well until Robins controversially departed to rivals Barnsley in September, leaving the Millers at the top of the league. Former manager Ronnie Moore replaced him and led the club to their first ever play-off final and first trip to the new Wembley Stadium, where they lost 3–2 loss. In March 2011, following poor form he left Rotherham by mutual consent, and Andy Scott replaced him until he was sacked in March 2012. Steve Evans succeeded him, in the first season at the New York Stadium, and won promotion by finishing second in League Two. In the 2013–14 League One season, Rotherham gained a place in the League One play-offs, where they defeated Preston North End in the semi-finals to set up a second play-off final at Wembley Stadium in four years. In the final against Leyton Orient, the game went to a penalty shoot-out, where two saves from Adam Collin secured a second successive promotion for the club.

In the 2014–15 Championship season, Rotherham&#x27;s first after a nine-year absence, their survival was jeopardised by a points deduction for fielding the ineligible Farrend Rawson during their home win against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Rawson&#x27;s loan had expired two days prior to the match, and despite the club insisting it was an external administrative error, they were subsequently thrown back into a relegation battle. Safety was secured in the penultimate game of the season with a 2–1 home victory against Reading. Rotherham sold key players from their promotion winning campaigns before the 2015–16 season, including Ben Pringle, Craig Morgan and Kari Arnason. Evans left the club in September and former Leeds United manager Neil Redfearn was appointed as his replacement, being sacked in February 2016 after a run of six defeats in eight games. Neil Warnock was appointed as manager for the rest of the season, and the club stayed up, finishing 21st. Warnock left the club in May 2016 after not agreeing a contract extension. Alan Stubbs became the new Rotherham boss in June 2016, but was sacked in October. Rotherham replaced Stubbs with Kenny Jackett, who himself was replaced with Paul Warne, as Rotherham finished the season bottom of the league and were relegated to League One. As a result, they finished on 24 points, making them hold the current record for the lowest amount of points in a single season in the second division of English football, beating Blackpool FC and Stockport County’s 26 points finish. 

At the first attempt, Rotherham returned to the Championship, defeating Shrewsbury in the 2018 play-off final. Rotherham were relegated from the Championship the following season on the penultimate game of the campaign. In the 2019–20 season, Rotherham were promoted through points per game in 2nd place behind Coventry City. They were relegated back to League One at the end of the 2020–21 season as they suffered an 88th-minute equaliser against Cardiff City, which sent them down at Derby County&#x27;s expense. In the 2021–22 season, the Millers were promoted back to the Championship as runners-up, defeating Gillingham 2–0 on the final day of the season. The club also won the 2021–22 EFL Trophy at Wembley Stadium after defeating Sutton United 4–2 after extra time. Early in the 2022–23 season, manager Paul Warne departed for Derby County, being replaced by Exeter City boss Matt Taylor. At the end of the 2023–24 season, Rotherham were relegated back to League One.

== Kit and sponsorship ==

Since 2015, the naming rights to the stadium are currently owned by local multimillion-pound company AESSEAL.

The club&#x27;s principal sponsor is IPM Group and Asura which features on all the playing kits. The training wear has a separate sponsorship with Guardian Electrical appearing on all training and leisure wear. All kit is made by long-term sponsor Puma which has worked with the club for over 10 years.

== Stadium ==


The club&#x27;s traditional home was Millmoor in Rotherham where the team played from 1907 to 2008. On one side of the ground is the site of the new Main Stand which remains unfinished. It was hoped that the 4,500 capacity stand which is single tiered, all seated and covered, would be completed sometime during the 2006–07 season, but this had not come to fruition by the time the ground became disused in 2008. On the other side of the ground is the Millmoor Lane Stand, which has a mixture of covered and open seating. Roughly each section on this side is about a third of the length of the pitch. The covered seating in the middle of this stand looks quite distinctive, with several supporting pillars and an arched roof. Both ends are former terraces, with several supporting pillars and have now been made all seated. The larger of the two is the Tivoli End, which was used by home fans. It was noticeable that the pitch sloped up towards this end. The ground also benefits from a striking set of floodlights, the pylons of which are some of the tallest in the country at approximately high. Following the failure of the owners of the club and the owners of Millmoor to reach a lease agreement the club left for the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield in 2008.

Whilst a new purpose-built community stadium was being built in Rotherham, the club relocated to the Don Valley Stadium in nearby Sheffield for four seasons from 2008–09 to 2011–12.

In January 2010 the club announced that their new stadium, later named the AESSEAL New York Stadium, would be built on the former Guest and Chrimes foundry site in Rotherham town centre.
Preparation work on the site began in February 2010 to make way for the foundations to be put in place and for the old factory to be knocked down to make way for the stadium. Construction started in June 2011 and the first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012. The Millers won 2–1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham&#x27;s first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3–0,
Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground.

==Supporters==
In the TV series ChuckleVision, there are often references made to the club, whom the Chuckle Brothers support in real life. In &quot;Football Heroes&quot;, Paul and Barry play for Rotherham after a mix-up with two former players of the club, Paul scores an own-goal and thinking it was a genuine goal, celebrates with Barry. The brothers were made honorary presidents of Rotherham United Football Club in 2007.

<text>The Lines of Torres Vedras were lines of forts and other military defences built in secrecy to defend Lisbon during the Peninsular War. Named after the nearby town of Torres Vedras, they were ordered by Arthur Wellesley, Viscount Wellington, constructed by Colonel Richard Fletcher and his Portuguese workers between November 1809 and September 1810, and used to stop Marshal Masséna&#x27;s 1810 offensive. The Lines were declared a National Heritage by the Portuguese Government in March 2019.

== Development ==
At the beginning of the Peninsular War (1807–14) France and Spain signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau in October 1807. This provided for the invasion and subsequent division of Portuguese territory into three kingdoms. Subsequently, French troops under the command of General Junot entered Portugal, which requested support from the British. In July 1808 troops commanded by Sir Arthur Wellesley, the later Duke of Wellington, landed in Portugal and defeated French troops at the Battles of Roliça and Vimeiro. This forced Junot to negotiate the Convention of Cintra, which led to the evacuation of the French army from Portugal. In March 1809, Marshal Soult led a new French expedition that advanced south to the city of Porto before being repulsed by Portuguese-British troops and forced to withdraw. After this retreat, Wellesley&#x27;s forces advanced into Spain to join 33,000 Spanish troops under General Cuesta. At Talavera, some southwest of Madrid, they encountered and defeated 46,000 French soldiers under Marshal Claude Victor. After the Battle of Talavera, Wellington realised that he was seriously outnumbered by the French army, giving rise to the possibility that he could be forced to retreat to Portugal and possibly evacuate. He decided to strengthen the proposed evacuation area around the Fort of São Julião da Barra on the estuary of the River Tagus, near Lisbon.

==Planning==
In October 1809, Wellington, drawing on topographical maps prepared by José Maria das Neves Costa, and making use of a report that was prepared for General Junot in 1807, surveyed the area north of Lisbon with Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Fletcher. Eventually they chose the terrain from Torres Vedras to Lisbon because of its mountainous characteristics. From north to south, great undulations created peaks that straddled deep valleys, great gullies and wide ravines. The rugged and inhospitable area offered numerous possibilities for a stubborn rearguard fight from forts on many of the peaks.

Following the decision on the location, Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Fletcher ordered the work to begin on a network of interlocking fortifications, redoubts, escarpments, dams that flooded large areas, and other defences. Roads were also built to enable troops to move rapidly between forts. The work was supervised by Fletcher, assisted by Major John Thomas Jones, and 11 other British Officers, four Portuguese Army Engineers, and two KGL officers. The cost was less than £200,000 according to the Royal Engineers, one of the least expensive but most productive military investments in history.

When the results of the surveys by the Royal Engineers were completed, it was possible, in February 1810, to begin work on 150 smaller interlinking defensive positions, using, wherever possible, the natural features of the landscape. The work received a boost after the loss to the French of the fortress at the Siege of Almeida in August 1810 led to the public conscription of Portuguese labourers. The works were sufficiently complete to halt the advance of the French troops, who arrived in October of the same year. Even after the French had retreated from Portugal, construction of the lines continued in expectation of their return, and in 1812 34,000 men were still working on them. On completion there were 152 fortifications with a total of 648 cannon.

==Construction==
The work began on the main defensive works on 3 November 1809, initially at the Fort of São Julião da Barra and almost immediately afterwards at the Fort of São Vicente (St. Vincent) overlooking the town of Torres Vedras and at the Fort of Alqueidão on top of Monte Agraço. The entire construction was carried out in great secrecy and the French never became aware of it. Only one report appeared in the London newspapers, a major source of information for Napoleon. It is said that the British government did not know about the forts and was stunned when Wellington first said in dispatches that he had retreated to them. Even the British Ambassador in Lisbon appears to have been unaware of what was happening. These defences were accompanied by a scorched earth policy to their north in which the inhabitants were told to leave their farms, destroying all food they could not take and anything else that may be useful to the French. Although ultimately contributing to the success of the defence, this policy led to high rates of mortality among the Portuguese who had retreated south of the lines. By some estimates 40,000 died.

Labour for construction of the forts was supplied by Portuguese regiments from Lisbon, by hired Portuguese and, ultimately, through conscription of the whole district. The 152 works were supervised by just 18 engineers. The Lines were not continuous, as in the case of a defensive wall, but consisted of a series of mutually supporting forts and other defences that both guarded roads that the French could take and also covered each other’s flanks. The majority of the defences were redoubts holding 200 to 300 troops and three to six cannon, normally 12-pounders, which could fire canister shot or cannonballs. Each redoubt was protected by a ditch or dry moat, with parapets, and was palisaded. By the time the French reached the First Line in October 1810, 126 works had been completed and were manned by 29,750 men with 247 heavy guns. Wellington did not use his front-line troops to man the forts: instead, manpower was mainly provided by the Portuguese. Construction continued after the withdrawal of the French and was not fully completed until 1812.

Originally the Second Line was intended to be the main line of defence, north of Lisbon. The First Line, or Outer Line, was approximately to north of the Second Line. The original purpose of the First Line was to only delay the French. In fact, the First Line was not the original plan, the work was only carried out because the defenders were given extra time due to the slow advance of the French Army. In the end, the First Line succeeded in holding the French and the Second Line was never required. A Third Line, surrounding the Fort of São Julião da Barra near Lisbon, was built to protect Wellington’s evacuation by sea from the fort. A fourth line, of which little remains, was built south of the Tagus opposite Lisbon to prevent a French invasion of the city by boat.

===First line===

Wellington&#x27;s first idea had been to construct the first line from Alhandra on the banks of the Tagus to Rio São Lourenço on the Atlantic coast, with advanced works at Torres Vedras, Sobral de Monte Agraço, and other commanding points. The delays to the French arrival, however, enabled him to strengthen the first line sufficiently to warrant aiming to hold it permanently rather than just using it for delaying purposes. Surveying this line from east to west, the first section from Alhandra to Arruda was about long, of which towards the Tagus had been inundated; another or more had been scarped into a precipice, and the most vulnerable point had been obstructed by a huge abatis. The additional defences included 23 redoubts mounting 96 guns, besides a flotilla of gunboats to guard the right flank on the Tagus. This area was under the command of Hill&#x27;s division. Defences still visible in this section include the Fort of Subserra.
The second section extended from Arruda to the west of Monte Agraço, which was crowned by the very large fort now known as the Fort of Alqueidão, mounting twenty-five guns, with three smaller forts to support it. Monte Agraço itself was held by Pack&#x27;s brigade with Anglo-Portuguese 5th Division (Leith&#x27;s) in reserve behind it, while the less completely fortified country to the east was entrusted to the British Light Division.

The third section stretched from the west of Monte Agraço for nearly to the gorge of the river Sizandro, a little to south of Torres Vedras. This was strengthened by two redoubts which commanded the road from Sobral to Montachique. Here, therefore, were concentrated the 1st, 4th, and 6th divisions, under the eye of Wellington himself, who established his headquarters at Pero Negro, where he remained from approximately 16 October 1810 to 15 November 1810.

The last and most westerly section of the first line ran from the gorge of the Sizandro to the sea, a distance of nearly , more than half of which, however, on the western side had been rendered impassable by the damming of the Sizandro and by the conversion of its lower reaches into one huge inundation. The chief defence consisted of the entrenched camp of the Fort of São Vicente, a little to the north of Torres Vedras, which dominated the paved road leading from Leiria to Lisbon. The force assigned to this part of the Line was Picton&#x27;s division.

===Second line===
The second line of defence was still more formidable. It can broadly be divided into three sections, from the Fort of Casa on the Tagus to Bucelas, from Bucelas to Mafra, and from Mafra to the sea, a total distance of . The main forts along this line that remain identifiable are three forts on the Serra da Aguieira that served to support the Fort of Casa in its defence of the River Tagus as well as covering the Bucelas Gorge. They also exchanged crossfire with the Fort of Arpim to their north, which was a link between the first and second lines as it was close to three other forts designed to protect the road from Bucelas to Alverca do Ribatejo. To the west of Bucelas was a line of hill-top forts dominated by the Montachique mountain. The mountain, at an altitude of 408 metres, was not fortified but was defended by what are today known as the Fort of Mosqueiro, the Fort of Ribas and others. Closer to Mafra, overlooking the town of Malveira, was the Fort of Feira, which was at the centre of a complex of 19 strongholds in the second Line. Mafra was one of the principle positions on the second line, with its defences being centred around the Tapada or royal park.

===Third and fourth lines===
In the event of failure even in the face of all these precautions, a very powerful line, long, was thrown up around the Fort of São Julião da Barra on the Tagus estuary to cover a retreat and any embarkation if it became necessary. This was considered to be the third line.

British ships dominated the Portuguese coast and the Tagus estuary, so a waterborne invasion by the French was unlikely. However, to guard against the possibility that the French would try to bypass the lines to the north of Lisbon by heading south along the left bank of the Tagus and then approaching Lisbon by boat, a fourth line was built south of the Tagus in the Almada area. The line was 7.3 kilometres (4.5 mi) long. It had 17 redoubts and covered trenches, 86 pieces of artillery, and was defended by marines and orderlies from Lisbon, with a total of 7,500 men.

==Holding the Lines==
The Anglo-Portuguese Army was forced to retreat to the first line after winning the Battle of Buçaco on 27 September 1810. The French army under Marshal Masséna discovered a barren land (under the scorched earth policy) and an enemy behind an almost impenetrable defensive position. Masséna&#x27;s forces arrived at the lines on 11 October and took Sobral de Monte Agraço the following day. On 14 October the VIII Corps tried to push forward but at the Battle of Sobral they were repelled in an attempt to assault a strong British outpost. After attempting to wait out the enemy, the lack of food and fodder in the area north of the lines meant that Masséna was forced to order a French retreat northwards, starting on the night of 14/15 November 1810, to find an area that had not been subjected to the scorched earth policy.

In December 1810, fearing a French attempt on the left of the Tagus, a chain of 17 redoubts was constructed from Almada to Trafaria. However, the French made no movement, and after holding out through February, when starvation really set in, Marshal Masséna ordered a retreat at the beginning of March 1811, taking a month to get to Spain.

Marshal Masséna had begun his campaign with his 65,000 strong army (l&#x27;Armée de Portugal). After losing 4,000 at the Battle of Buçaco, he arrived at Torres Vedras with 61,000 men in October 1810 facing attrition warfare. When he eventually returned to Spain in April 1811, he had lost a further 21,000 men, mostly from starvation, severe illness and disease. Casualties had not been helped by the fact that the Iberian peninsula had suffered one of the coldest winters it had ever known.

When the Allies renewed their offensive in 1811, they were reinforced with fresh British troops. The advance started from the Lines of Torres Vedras shortly after the French retreat. Although work continued on certain sections of the lines, they saw no further action during rest of the Peninsular War.

===Garrisons===

The lines were divided up into districts by Wellington in a letter dated 6 October 1810. Each district was allocated one Captain and one Lieutenant of Engineers:
# From Torres Vedras to the sea. HQ at Torres Vedras.
# From Sobral de Monte Agraço to the valley of Calhandriz. HQ at Sobral de Monte Agraço.
# From Alhandra to the valley of Calhandriz. HQ at Alhandra.
# From the banks of the Tagus, near Alverca, to the Pass of Bucelas, inclusive. HQ at Bucelas.
# From the Pass of Freixal, near Bucelas to the right of the Pass of Mafra. HQ at Montachique.
# From the Pass of Mafra to the sea. HQ at Mafra.
The total number of troops available to Wellington amounted, exclusive of two battalions of marines around the Fort of São Julião, to 42,000 British, of whom 35,000 were combat ready together with over 27,000 Portuguese regulars, of whom 24,000 were combat ready; about 12,000 Portuguese militia; and 20–30,000 &quot;ordenanças&quot;, a Portuguese militia force used mainly for guerrilla warfare. Lastly, the Marquis of la Romana contributed 8,000 Spanish troops to the lines around Mafra. Altogether, therefore, Wellington had some 60,000 regular frontline troops whom he could depend upon, and 20,000 more who could be trusted to man the lines.

The redoubts of the First Line did not require more than 20,000 men to defend them, which left the whole of the true field-army free not only to reinforce any threatened point but also to make counter-attacks. To facilitate such movements a chain of five signal stations was established from one end of the First Line to the other, which allowed a message to be sent along the lines in 7 minutes, or from the HQ to any point in 4 minutes. The signal stations on the First Line were:
* Redoubt n.30 close to the ocean (Ponte do Rol)
* Fort of São Vicente at Torres Vedras
* Monte do Socorro close to Pêro Negro, Wellington&#x27;s headquarters. 
* Monte Agraço
* Sobralinho, by the River Tagus.

while on the Second Line, five stations have been identified at:
* Forts of Serra da Aguieira
* Fort of Sunivel
* Montachique mountain (&quot;Cabeço de Montachique&quot;)
* Fort of Chipre
* Fort of São Julião at Ericeira

==Memorial==
A monument commemorating the victory of the Anglo-Portuguese troops over the French armies and the construction of the Torres Vedras Lines was approved in 1874 and finished in 1883. Somewhat reminiscent of Nelson’s Column in London, the column is topped by a statue of the Classical Greek figure of Hercules. This was executed by the sculptor Simões de Almeida who was also responsible for the Monument to the Restorers in Lisbon. The column used marble from the parish of Pêro Pinheiro in Sintra municipality.

The monument was constructed near the village of Alhandra in the municipality of Vila Franca de Xira, on the site of the Boavista redoubt (originally numbered as work Number 3). It is close to work Number 114, the Fort of Subserra (also known as the Fort of Alhandra), which can be visited. In 1911, two plaques were added to acknowledge the contributions of Richard Fletcher and of José Maria das Neves Costa, on whose original topographic maps Wellington based his plans for the Lines.

==Preservation and restoration==

Substantial portions of the Lines survive today, albeit in most cases in a heavily decayed condition due to past removal of stones. Apart from some limited restoration of Fort St. Vincent in the 1960s the Lines had effectively lain abandoned from the end of the Peninsular War to the beginning of this millennium. In 2001 the six municipalities covered by the Lines (Torres Vedras, Mafra, Sobral de Monte Agraço, Arruda dos Vinhos, Loures and Villa Franca de Xira), together with agencies of what is now the Direção-Geral do Património Cultural (Directorate-General for Cultural Heritage - DGPC), and the Direção dos Serviços de Engenharia (Directorate of Military Engineering) signed a protocol to protect, restore and sustain the Lines. However, initial work was limited due to lack of resources. With the bicentennial of the Lines fast approaching the six municipalities set up an inter-municipal platform to move things forward and decided to apply for funding through the EEA and Norway Grants programme. Funding was granted in 2007. 

EEA grants met the costs of 110 projects, while the municipalities funded the work at another 140 sites. Work involved included removal of excess vegetation, creation or restoration of access, archaeological studies, setting up of information boards, establishment of walking routes, and a Visitors&#x27; Centre in each municipality. This conservation work was awarded the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards in 2014.
The Leonel Trindade Municipal Museum, Torres Vedras in the centre of the town has a room dedicated to &quot;The Lines&quot; with a display of information boards and artefacts. A short distance from the museum just outside of the town, Fort of São Vicente and the Fort of Olheiros have been well conserved, with the former having a visitors&#x27; centre open Tue-Sun 10-1pm and 2-6pm. The visitors&#x27; centre has well-produced historic wall displays and a 20 min video. Other information centres along the lines are:

*Lines of Torres Interpretation Centre at Bucelas Wine museum.
*Fort of Casa
*Interpretation Centre at Sobral de Monte Agraço
*Centro Cultural do Morgado, Arruda dos Vinhos

<text>Yongin (; ) is a city in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, the largest in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. With a population over 1 million, the city has developed rapidly since the 21st century, recording the highest population growth of any city in the country. Yongin is a multi-nuclear city with multiple urban centers, not a single nuclear structure, and Giheung District crosses the Yeongdong Expressway and Dongbaek, while Suji District crosses Pungdeokcheon Stream and Jukjeon.

Yongin is a city almost as large as Seoul by area, consisting of the highly urbanized districts of Suji District and Giheung District and the semi-urbanized district of Cheoin District. Yongin&#x27;s urbanized districts are located close to the capital and many commute to and from downtown Seoul in approximately 30–40 minutes by car using the Gyeongbu Expressway or Yongin-Seoul Expressway, the Bundang Line subway, the Shinbundang Line subway or metropolitan buses. The Shinbundang Line with a maximum speed of extended to Suji District in January 2016, which allows Suji residents to travel to Gangnam Station in 25 minutes.

In December 2013, the Bundang Line extended to Suwon Station of Seoul Subway Line 1.

Yongin is home to Everland and Caribbean Bay, South Korea&#x27;s most popular amusement and water parks. The city is also home to the Korean Folk Village, the largest of its kind. The 12,000-capacity Yongin Stadium and the 37,000-capacity Yongin Citizen Sports Park Stadium are the largest sports venues in Yongin. Both stadiums are used mostly for football matches.

In 1985, Giheung-myeon was promoted to Giheung-eup under Presidential Decree No. 11772. In 1995, 660,000 m2 of Yeongdeok-ri, Giheung-eup, were incorporated into Suwon City.

<doc id="386381" wikidata="Q6736091" url="?curid=386381" title="Main Street (novel)">
<text>Main Street is a novel written by Sinclair Lewis, and published in 1920. Satirizing small-town life, &quot;Main Street&quot; is perhaps Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s most famous book and led in part to his eventual 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature. 

The story is set in the small town of Gopher Prairie, a fictionalized version of Sauk Centre, Minnesota, Lewis&#x27;s hometown, during the 1910s. It relates the life and struggles of Carol Milford Kennicott, a self-made young woman with a strong personality, as she comes into conflict with the small-town mentality of the residents of Gopher Prairie. References are made to the start of World War I, the United States&#x27; entry into the war, and the years following its end, including the start of Prohibition in 1920.

Highly acclaimed upon publication, &quot;Main Street&quot; was turned into a play in 1921, and a movie in 1923, the first by Warner Bros. studio. It remains a recognized American classic.

== Plot ==
Carol Milford, the daughter of a judge, grew up in Mankato, Minnesota, and became an orphan in her teenage years. In college, she reads a book on village improvement in a sociology class and begins to dream of redesigning villages and towns. After college, she attends a library school in Chicago and is exposed to many radical ideas and lifestyles. She becomes a librarian in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the state capital, but finds the work unrewarding. She marries Will Kennicott, a doctor from the small town of Gopher Prairie. When they marry, Will convinces her to live in his hometown. Carol is filled with disdain for the town&#x27;s physical ugliness and smug conservatism and immediately formulates plans to remake Gopher Prairie.

She speaks with its members about progressive changes, joins women&#x27;s clubs, distributes literature, and holds a party to liven up Gopher Prairie&#x27;s inhabitants. Despite her efforts, these ventures are ineffective and she is constantly derided by the leading cliques. She finds some comfort and companionship with a variety of social outsiders in the town, but these companions all fail to live up to her expectations.

After a political meeting of the Nonpartisan League is broken up by local authorities, Carol leaves her husband and moves to Washington, D.C. to become a clerk in a wartime government agency but she eventually returns. Nevertheless, she does not feel defeated:

I do not admit that Main Street is as beautiful as it should be! I do not admit that Gopher Prairie is greater or more generous than Europe! I do not admit that dishwashing is enough to satisfy all women! I may not have fought the good fight, but I have kept the faith. (Chapter 39)

== Reception ==
The book was a commercial success. It was the best-selling work of fiction in America for the year 1921, according to Publishers Weekly.

Some of Lewis&#x27;s contemporaries said the novel was too bleak, even humorless, in its portrayal of ignorant small-town life and people. However, &quot;Main Street&quot; is generally considered some of Lewis&#x27;s most significant and enduring work, along with its 1922 successor &quot;Babbitt&quot;.

Contemporary parodies of the book included &quot;Ptomaine Street&quot;, by Carolyn Wells, and &quot;Jane Street of Gopher Prairie&quot;, by James Stetson Metcalfe.

Some small-town residents resented being portrayed this way, and the book was banned by the public library of Alexandria, Minnesota.

Because Lewis and his book had become so popular, high-school sports teams from his hometown began to be called the &quot;Main Streeters&quot; as early as the 1925–26 school year. This name was essentially given to the town by the nearby towns at school events. Sauk Centre High School teams still go by the name in a tribute to Lewis.

== Awards and nominations ==
&quot;Main Street&quot; was initially chosen by the jury for the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for literature, but the board of trustees overturned the jury&#x27;s decision. The prize instead went to Edith Wharton for &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;. In 1926, Lewis refused the Pulitzer when he was awarded it for &quot;Arrowsmith.&quot;

In 1930, Lewis was the first American to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. While a Nobel Prize is awarded to the author, not the work, and itself does not cite a particular work for which he was chosen, &quot;Main Street&quot; was Lewis&#x27; best-known work and enormously popular at the time. In the Nobel committee&#x27;s presentation speech, both &quot;Main Street&quot; and &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; were cited. The prize was awarded &quot;... for his vigorous and graphic art of description and his ability to create, with wit and humour, new types of characters.&quot;

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Main Street&quot; #68 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

<doc id="386384" wikidata="Q123682" url="?curid=386384" title="Randy Johnson">
<text>Randall David Johnson (born September 10, 1963), nicknamed &quot;the Big Unit&quot;, is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (1988–2009) for six teams, primarily the Seattle Mariners and Arizona Diamondbacks.

At tall, Johnson was the tallest player in MLB history when he entered the league, contributing to his extremely intimidating persona and pitching style. As a player, he was especially known for his overpowering fastball and devastating slider, a combination that remained effective throughout his lengthy career. While he initially struggled with control in his early seasons, Johnson subsequently established himself as one of the most dominant pitchers of his era, leading his league in strikeouts nine times, and in earned run average, winning percentage, and complete games four times each. Along with teammate Curt Schilling, Johnson was one of two World Series Most Valuable Players in 2001; in the Series, Johnson won three games and led the Arizona Diamondbacks to a World Series victory over the New York Yankees in the fourth season of the team&#x27;s existence. He won the pitching Triple Crown in 2002.

Johnson&#x27;s 303 career victories are the fifth-most by a left-hander in MLB history, while his 4,875 strikeouts place him second all time behind Nolan Ryan and first among left-handers. He recorded 300 strikeouts in a season six different times, a Major League record tied with Nolan Ryan. Johnson is a ten-time All-Star, won the Cy Young Award five times, and is one of only two pitchers (the other is Greg Maddux) to win the award in four consecutive seasons (1999–2002). Johnson won Cy Young Awards in both leagues. He is also one of five pitchers to pitch no-hitters in both leagues, and one of 21 pitchers in history to record a win against all 30 MLB franchises.

Johnson enjoyed a career longevity uncommon to pitchers, with his signature fastball-slider combination remaining effective well into his 40s. Four of his six 300-strikeout seasons occurred after his 35th birthday. On May 18, 2004, at 40 years old, he threw Major League Baseball&#x27;s 17th perfect game, and remains the oldest pitcher to accomplish the feat. Johnson retired at the age of 46, and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015 in his first year of eligibility. He is the first member of the Hall to be depicted in a Diamondbacks uniform on his plaque. Johnson&#x27;s accomplishments and accolades have led to him being widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in the San Francisco Bay Area suburb of Walnut Creek, California, to Carol Hannah and Rollen Charles &quot;Bud&quot; Johnson. By the time he entered Livermore High School, he was a star in baseball and basketball. In 1982, as a senior, he struck out 121 batters in 66 innings, and threw a perfect game in his last high school start.

==College career==
Johnson accepted a full athletic scholarship to play baseball for the University of Southern California. While at USC, he also played two years of basketball. He was a starter at USC (where he was a teammate of Mark McGwire) under coach Rod Dedeaux, but often exhibited control problems.

==Professional career==
===Drafts and minor leagues===
After high school, Johnson was selected by the Atlanta Braves in the 4th round of the 1982 MLB draft, but did not sign. He was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the second round of the 1985 Major League Baseball draft. In 1985, he pitched for the Jamestown Expos of the New York-Pennsylvania League. In 1986, he pitched for the West Palm Beach Expos of the Florida State League. In 1987, he pitched for the Jacksonville Expos of the Southern League. In 1988, he pitched for the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association.

===Montreal Expos (1988–1989)===
He made his major league debut on September 15, 1988, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, earning a 9–4 victory with a five-inning outing in which he gave up two runs with five strikeouts; his first victim was Orestes Destrade in the second inning. Johnson posted a record of 3–0 with a 2.42 earned run average (ERA) in four games in 1988, but 1989 saw him slip to an 0–4 mark with a 6.67 ERA in seven games through May 7. On May 25, 1989, he was traded to the Seattle Mariners in a trade involving five pitchers that brought Mark Langston to Montreal. In 11 total games played with the Expos, he went 3–4 with a 4.69 ERA and one complete game in innings with 51 strikeouts and 33 walks.

===Seattle Mariners (1989–1998)===
====1989–1992====
After joining the Mariners during the 1989 season, Johnson led the American League in walks for three consecutive seasons (1990–1992), and hit batsmen in 1992 and 1993. In July 1991, facing the Milwaukee Brewers, the erratic Johnson allowed 4 runs on 1 hit, thanks to 10 walks in 4 innings. A month later, a 9th-inning single cost him a no-hitter against the Oakland Athletics. Johnson suffered another 10-walk, 4-inning start in 1992.

His untapped talent was explosive: In 1990, Johnson became the first left-hander to strike out Wade Boggs three times in one game, and a no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers attested to his potential. Johnson credits a session with Nolan Ryan late in the 1992 season with helping him take his career to the next level; Ryan has said that he appreciated Johnson&#x27;s talent and did not want to see him take as long to figure certain things out as he had taken. Ryan recommended a slight change in his delivery; before the meeting, Johnson would land on the heel of his foot after delivering a pitch, and he therefore usually landed offline from home plate. Ryan suggested that he land on the ball of his foot, and almost immediately, he began finding the strike zone more consistently. In a September 27, 1992, game against the Texas Rangers, with Ryan the opposing starting pitcher, Johnson struck out 18 batters in eight innings while throwing 160 pitches, a pitch count that has not been reached in an MLB game since. It was during the 1992 off-season when Johnson returned home for Christmas only to lose his father to an aortic aneurysm. His father&#x27;s death was so devastating that he decided to quit baseball, only to have his mother convince him otherwise.

====1993====
Johnson broke out in 1993, posting a 19–8 record, 3.24 ERA and one save, his first of six 300-plus strikeout seasons (308), and he was also the first Seattle Mariners pitcher to reach 300 strikeouts in a single season. In May 1993, Johnson again lost a no-hitter to a 9th-inning single; again, the opponent was the Oakland Athletics. He also recorded his 1,000th career strikeout against the Minnesota Twins&#x27; Chuck Knoblauch. Prior to the trade deadline, Johnson was nearly dealt to the Toronto Blue Jays for Steve Karsay and Mike Timlin. Toronto general manager Pat Gillick had two separate transactions on the table including the one for Johnson with Seattle general manager Woody Woodward and one for Rickey Henderson with Oakland general manager Sandy Alderson. When Gillick was unable to contact Woodward he agreed to utilize the deal with Alderson. When Woodward returned Gillick&#x27;s call he said he would agree to the deal for Johnson. However, Gillick gave his word to Alderson even though the deal had not been finalized. At the 1993 All-Star Game in Baltimore, Maryland, in a famous incident, Johnson threw a fastball over the head of Philadelphia Phillies first baseman John Kruk. On October 3, Johnson entered the final game of the season as a defensive substitution, replacing Brian Turang in left field. This made him the tallest player to play the field in baseball history.

====1995====
After pitching well in the strike-shortened 1994 season, Johnson won the American League Cy Young Award in 1995 with an 18–2 record, 2.48 ERA and 294 strikeouts. His .900 winning percentage was the second highest in AL history, behind Johnny Allen, who had gone 15–1 for the Cleveland Indians in 1937. Johnson became the first regular starting pitcher in history to strike out more than a third of all batters faced. He also became the first Seattle Mariners pitcher to win the Cy Young Award, and the only one until Félix Hernández took home the honor in 2010. Johnson capped the Mariners&#x27; late-season comeback by pitching a three-hitter in the AL West&#x27;s one-game playoff, crushing the California Angels&#x27; hopes with 12 strikeouts. Thus unable to start in the 5-game ALDS series against the Yankees until the third game, Johnson watched as New York took a 2–0 series lead. He defeated the Yankees in Game 3 with 10 strikeouts in seven innings.

When the series went the full five games, the Mariners having come back from a 2–0 deficit to win both games at the Kingdome, Johnson made a dramatic relief appearance in the series final, Game 5, on only one day&#x27;s rest. Entering a 4–4 game in the ninth inning, Johnson pitched the 9th, 10th, and 11th innings. He allowed one run, struck out six, and held on for the series-ending win in Seattle&#x27;s dramatic comeback.

====1996−1998====
Johnson was sidelined throughout much of the 1996 season with a back injury, but he rebounded in 1997 with a 20–4 record, 291 strikeouts, and a 2.28 ERA (his personal best). Between May 1994 and October 1997, Johnson had gone 53–9, including a 16–0 streak that fell one short of the AL record. Johnson had two 19-strikeout starts in 1997, on June 24 and August 8.

Another colorful All-Star Game moment proceeded in the 1997 edition involving former Expos teammate Larry Walker, at that point with the Colorado Rockies. When Johnson had started an interleague game versus the Rockies on June 12, Walker chose not to play, explaining that &quot;I faced Randy one time in spring training and he almost killed me.&quot; In the All-Star Game, Walker batted against Johnson, who theatrically threw over his head. Ever adaptable, Walker placed his batting helmet backwards and switched sides in the batters&#x27; box to stand &quot;right-handed&quot; for one pitch. He ended the at bat by drawing a walk. The incident momentarily drew mirth and laughter from players in both dugouts, fans and announcers, and, of course, comparisons to the at bat with Kruk in the 1993 All-Star Game. In spite of garnering a reputation of avoiding Johnson, Walker batted .393 (11 hits in 28 at bats) against him in his career, nearly double the rate of all left-handed batters at .199. When the 1998 season began, Johnson was upset the Mariners would not offer him a contract extension, given his contract was expiring after the season. Though the Mariners initially wanted to keep Johnson, turning down a trade offer from the Los Angeles Dodgers, they fell out of contention, going 8–20 in June. Minutes before the non-waiver trade deadline, on July 31, the Mariners traded Johnson to the Houston Astros for three minor leaguers: Freddy García, Carlos Guillén, and John Halama. Johnson was a Mariner for nearly 9 years, his longest tenure with one team.

===Houston Astros (1998)===
In 11 regular-season starts with the Astros, Johnson posted a 10–1 record, a 1.28 ERA, and 116 strikeouts in innings, and pitched four shutouts. Johnson finished 7th in the National League Cy Young Award voting, despite pitching only two months in the league, and helped Houston win their second straight National League Central division title. During the playoffs, however, the Astros lost the 1998 NLDS to the San Diego Padres, 3–1. Johnson started Games 1 and 4, both losses. He only gave up three earned runs combined in the two games, but received only one run in support (in Game 4).

===Arizona Diamondbacks (1999–2004)===
Johnson agreed to a four-year contract, with an option for a fifth year, for $52.4 million, with the Arizona Diamondbacks, a second-year franchise. Johnson led the team to the playoffs that year on the strength of a 17–9 record and 2.48 ERA with 364 strikeouts, leading the majors in innings, complete games, and strikeouts. Johnson won the 1999 NL Cy Young Award and Warren Spahn Award as the best left-handed pitcher in MLB. Johnson became the third pitcher in history, after Gaylord Perry and Pedro Martínez, to win the Cy Young Award in both the American and National Leagues; Martínez won the AL Cy Young in the same season that Johnson won its NL counterpart. Johnson finished 2000 with 19 wins, 347 strikeouts and a 2.64 ERA, and won his second consecutive NL Cy Young Award and Warren Spahn Award. The Diamondbacks acquired Curt Schilling from the Philadelphia Phillies in July 2000, and the two aces anchored the Diamondbacks rotation.

In the fourth year of the franchise&#x27;s existence, Johnson and Schilling carried the Arizona Diamondbacks to their first World Series appearance and victory in 2001 against the New York Yankees. Johnson and Schilling shared the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, the Babe Ruth Award, and were named &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2001 &quot;Sportsmen of the Year.&quot; For the first of two consecutive seasons, Johnson and Schilling finished 1–2 in the Cy Young balloting. Johnson also won his third consecutive Warren Spahn Award. Johnson&#x27;s performance was particularly dominating, striking out 11 in a 3-hit shutout in Game 2, pitching seven innings for the victory in Game 6 and then coming on in relief the following day to pick up the win in Game 7. Of Arizona&#x27;s eleven post-season wins in 2001, Johnson had five. He is also the last pitcher to win 3 games in a single World Series. Johnson&#x27;s Game 7 relief appearance was his second of the 2001 season; on July 19, a game against the Padres was delayed by two electrical explosions in Qualcomm Stadium. When the game resumed the following day, Johnson stepped in as the new pitcher and racked up 16 strikeouts in seven innings, technically setting the record for the most strikeouts in a relief stint.
In a freak accident on March 24, 2001, at Tucson Electric Park, during the 7th inning of a spring training game against the San Francisco Giants, Johnson threw a fastball to Calvin Murray that struck and killed a dove. The ball was ruled dead, and it was ruled &quot;no pitch&quot;. The event was not unique in baseball history, but it became one of Johnson&#x27;s most-remembered baseball moments; a news story 15 years later remarked, &quot;the event remains iconic, and the Big Unit says he gets asked about the incident nearly as much as he does about winning the World Series later that year with the Arizona Diamondbacks&quot;.

Johnson struck out 20 batters in a game on May 8, 2001, against the Cincinnati Reds. Johnson recorded all 20 strikeouts in the first nine innings and was replaced before the start of the tenth, but because the game went into extra innings, he is ineligible to share the nine-inning game strikeout record. On August 23, 2001, Johnson struck out three batters on nine pitches in the 6th inning of a 5–1 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates, becoming the 30th pitcher in major league history to pitch an immaculate inning. Johnson&#x27;s 2001 season was the 2nd time in MLB history where a starting pitcher had more than twice as many strikeouts in a season (372) as hits allowed (181) (first accomplished by Pedro Martinez in the 2000 season with 284 strikeouts and 128 hits and later also accomplished by Max Scherzer in 2017, and both Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander in 2019). He also became the second pitcher to strike out 300 more batters than he walked, walking 71 batters against 372 strikeouts (first accomplished by Sandy Koufax who struck out 382 batters against 71 walks in 1965).

In 2002, Johnson won the pitching Triple Crown, leading the NL in wins, ERA, and strikeouts, and was voted his fourth consecutive Cy Young and Warren Spahn Awards. It was Johnson&#x27;s fourth consecutive 300-strikeout season with the Diamondbacks, and fifth consecutive overall, extending his own MLB record from the previous season in which he set the record for the most consecutive seasons with 300 or more strikeouts in a season by a pitcher. He also became the first pitcher in baseball history to post a 24–5 record.

Johnson spent the majority of the 2003 season on the disabled list and was ineffective in the few injury-hampered starts he did make. He hit the only home run of his career on September 19, 2003, against the Milwaukee Brewers. Johnson was a .125 hitter over 625 career at-bats.

====Perfect game====

On May 18, 2004, Johnson pitched the 17th perfect game in MLB history. At 40 years of age, he was the oldest pitcher to accomplish this feat. Johnson had 13 strikeouts on his way to a 2–0 victory against the Atlanta Braves. The perfect game made him the fifth pitcher in Major League history (after Cy Young, Jim Bunning, Nolan Ryan, and Hideo Nomo) to pitch a no-hitter in both leagues. He also became the fifth pitcher in Major League history to throw both a no-hitter and a perfect game in his career (after Young, Bunning, Addie Joss, and Sandy Koufax; since Johnson, Mark Buehrle and Roy Halladay have joined this group).

Johnson struck out Jeff Cirillo of the San Diego Padres on June 29, 2004, to become only the fourth MLB player to reach 4,000 strikeouts in a career.

He finished the 2004 season with a 16–14 record, though his poor record was partially due to a lack of run support as his ERA that year was 2.60. Johnson led the major leagues in strikeouts (with 290) and finished second to Roger Clemens for the Cy Young Award. In the games where Arizona scored three or more runs, Johnson was 13–2. As his team only won 51 games that year, his ratio of winning 31.3% of his team&#x27;s games was the highest for any starting pitcher since Steve Carlton in 1972 (who won 27 of the Phillies&#x27; 59 wins for an all-time record ratio of 45.8%).

===New York Yankees (2005–2006)===

The Diamondbacks traded Johnson to the New York Yankees for Javier Vázquez, Brad Halsey, Dioner Navarro, and cash in January 2005. Johnson pitched Opening Day for the Yankees on April 3, 2005, against the Boston Red Sox. Johnson was inconsistent through 2005, allowing 32 home runs; however, he regained his dominance in late 2005. He was 5–0 against the Yankees&#x27; division rival Red Sox and finished the season 17–8 with a 3.79 ERA, and was second in the AL with 211 strikeouts.

In 2005, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; published an update of their 1999 book &quot;Baseball&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players&quot;. Johnson did not make the original edition, but for the 2005 update, with his career totals considerably higher and his 2001 World Championship season taken into account, he was ranked at Number 60.

Johnson was a disappointment in Game 3 of the 2005 Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, allowing 5 runs on 2 home runs in 3 innings. He avoided being charged with the loss when the Yankees rallied, but eventually lost. In Game 5 in Anaheim, Johnson made an effective relief appearance with 4 1/3 scoreless innings after Mike Mussina gave up 5 runs and 6 hits to give the Angels a 5–2 lead, but the Yankees were unable to come back in the series.

After an inconclusive year in pinstripes, New York fans hoped that Johnson would return to his dominant style in his second Yankee season. Johnson began 2006 well, but then he struggled to find form. In between some impressive performances, he allowed 5 or more runs in 7 of his first 18 starts for the season. Johnson was more effective in the second half. Johnson finished the season with a 17–11 record, a subpar 5.00 ERA with only 172 strikeouts. It was revealed at the end of the 2006 season that a herniated disc in Johnson&#x27;s back had been stiffening him and it was only in his second to last start of the season that he decided to get it checked. This exposure caused him to miss his last start of 2006. After being given epidural anesthesia and a few bullpen sessions he was cleared to start in game 3 of the ALDS; however, he gave up 5 runs in 5 innings and being saddled with the loss.

===Second stint with the Arizona Diamondbacks (2007–2008)===

In January 2007, the Yankees traded Johnson back to the Diamondbacks, almost two years to the day that Arizona had traded him to New York, for a package of Luis Vizcaíno, Alberto González, Steven Jackson, and Ross Ohlendorf. The Yankees&#x27; decision to trade Johnson was primarily based on a pre-season conversation he had with Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman about the importance of being closer to his family in Phoenix after the death of his brother.

Johnson missed most of April, rehabilitating his injured back before returning on April 24, 2007. Johnson allowed six runs in 5 innings and took the loss, but struck out seven. He returned to form, and by his tenth start of the season was among the NL&#x27;s top ten strikeout pitchers. But on July 3, his surgically repaired disc from the previous season was reinjured. Johnson had season-ending surgery on the same disc, this time removing it completely. Reporting that the procedure went &quot;a little better than expected&quot;, Arizona hoped that Johnson would be ready for the 2008 season.

Johnson made his season debut on April 14, 2008, against the San Francisco Giants at AT&amp;T Park eight months following his back surgery. On June 3, 2008, Johnson struck out Mike Cameron of the Milwaukee Brewers for career strikeout number 4,673. With this strikeout Johnson surpassed Roger Clemens for the number two spot on the all-time strikeout leaders list. Johnson struck out 8 in the game but could not get the win as the Diamondbacks lost 7–1.

Johnson got his 4,700th career strikeout on July 6, 2008. On July 27, 2008, Fred Lewis became the first left-handed batter to get four hits against Johnson in a game. In the first at-bat in this game, a fog horn went off as Johnson was releasing his pitch, causing him to throw an eephus pitch which fell for a strike. He finished the season with an 11–10 record and an ERA of 3.91, recording his 100th career complete game in a 2–1 victory over the Colorado Rockies.

===San Francisco Giants (2009)===

On December 26, 2008, Johnson signed a one-year deal with his hometown San Francisco Giants for a reported $8 million, with a possible $2.5 million in performance bonuses and another $2.5 million in award bonuses. Johnson became the 24th pitcher to reach 300 wins, beating the Washington Nationals (the team that he first played for when they were known as the Montreal Expos) on June 4 at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. He became the seventh left-handed pitcher to achieve the 300-win milestone and the fifth pitcher in the last 50 years to get his 299th and 300th win in consecutive starts, joining Warren Spahn, Steve Carlton, Gaylord Perry, and Tom Seaver. Johnson was placed on the 60-day disabled list with a torn rotator cuff in his throwing shoulder on July 28, 2009. Johnson was activated by the Giants on September 16, 2009, and assigned to the Giants bullpen. On September 19, 2009, Johnson made his first relief appearance in 4 years, facing the Los Angeles Dodgers for 3 batters. At age 46, he was at the time the second oldest player in Major League Baseball, trailing only former Mariners teammate Jamie Moyer.

===Retirement===

On January 5, 2010, he announced his retirement from professional baseball. The Mariners invited Johnson to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Seattle Mariners home opener at Safeco Field on April 12, 2010, and inducted Johnson into the Mariners Hall of Fame on January 17, 2012. The Diamondbacks invited Johnson and former teammate Curt Schilling to both throw out the ceremonial first pitches for the Arizona Diamondbacks&#x27; recognition of the 10th anniversary of the 2001 World Series team that defeated the New York Yankees.

Johnson was selected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2015. The Diamondbacks retired his number on August 8, 2015. At the retirement ceremony, Johnson was presented with a replica of the drum set used by Neil Peart, drummer for the Canadian band Rush, during their 30th anniversary tour.

Johnson has participated in over 40 trips with the United Service Organizations. He also supports initiatives to fight homelessness. In recognition of all his charitable efforts, he was the Hall of Fame recipient of the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award in 2019.

In January 2015, Johnson was named a Special Assistant to the team president of the Arizona Diamondbacks, Derrick Hall.

In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Johnson at number 28 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski. In 2022, as part of their SN Rushmore project, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named Johnson on their &quot;Phoenix Mount Rushmore of Sports&quot;, along with Arizona Cardinals football player Larry Fitzgerald, Phoenix Suns basketball player Steve Nash, Phoenix Mercury basketball player Diana Taurasi.

==Photography career==
Since retiring from baseball, Johnson has pursued a second career as a photographer. He had studied photojournalism at the University of Southern California, and photography remained a passion. He has done photography work for NFL games, a tour of the rock band Rush, and has done wildlife photography.

==Pitching style==
In the prime of his career, Johnson&#x27;s fastball was clocked as high as , with a low three-quarters delivery (nearly sidearm). His signature pitch was a slider that broke down and away from left-handed hitters and down and in to right-handed hitters. The effectiveness of the pitch is marked by its velocity being in the low 90s along with tight late break; hitters often believed they were thrown a fastball until the ball broke just before it crossed home plate. Right-handed hitters have swung through and missed sliders that nearly hit their back foot. Johnson dubbed his slider &quot;Mr. Snappy&quot;. In later years, his fastball declined to the range and his slider clocked at around . Johnson also threw a split-finger fastball that behaved like a change-up, and a sinker to induce ground-ball outs. In a June 27, 2012, appearance on &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot;, Adam Dunn (a left-handed batter) was asked who the best pitcher he faced was. &quot;Honestly, Randy Johnson when he was good. It&#x27;s hopeless. It&#x27;s like a hopeless feeling. The first time you face him you feel like he&#x27;s going to hit you right in the back of the neck when he throws it, like every pitch is going to hit you in the back of the neck. And it ends up down and away for a strike and you just have to trust it&#x27;s going to be a strike, and heaven forbid he doesn&#x27;t lose one out there and heaven forbid, there goes your cheek.&quot;

===&quot;Big Unit&quot; nickname===
During batting practice in 1988, the Johnson, then with the Montreal Expos, collided head-first with outfielder Tim Raines, prompting his teammate to exclaim, &quot;Damn! You&#x27;re a big unit!&quot; The nickname stuck.

Throughout much of his career, Johnson held the title of tallest player in MLB history. Former pitchers Eric Hillman, Andrew Sisco, Andrew Brackman, and Chris Young have also been measured at 6&#x27;10&quot;. After his retirement, the title of tallest player was held by Johnson&#x27;s former Diamondback teammate Jon Rauch, a relief pitcher who is .

Johnson guest-starred in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Bart Has Two Mommies&quot;, which aired on March 19, 2006. Johnson appeared in the movie &quot;Little Big League&quot;, playing himself.

Johnson appeared in a Just for Men commercial where he had a grey beard and his neighbors told him &quot;Your beard is weird.&quot; Johnson also appeared in a Right Guard commercial where he fired dodgeballs at Kyle Brandt, who represented odor. Johnson also appeared in several commercials for Nike in 1998. The spots comedically portrayed him taking batting practice (swinging ineptly at balls from a pitching machine) in his hope that he would break Roger Maris&#x27;s then-single-season record for home runs. He made a cameo appearance in a commercial for &quot;MLB 2K9&quot; with teammate Tim Lincecum. Johnson made an appearance in a GEICO insurance commercial. In 2012, he appeared in a TV ad for Pepsi Max. In 2016, Johnson appeared in a TV ad for the Mini Clubman.

In 2022, Johnson appeared with his former teammates Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez as well as Hall of Famer David Ortiz in a commercial for the streaming service DirecTV Stream parodying &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, as the group (titled Goatbusters) battles a giant Mr. Redlegs destroying a baseball stadium.

<text>The Winkie Country is the western region of the fictional Land of Oz in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s classic series of Oz books, first introduced in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). The Winkie Country is in the West, noted by later being ruled by the Wicked Witch of the West.

This quadrant is strictly distinguished by the color yellow. This color is worn by most of the native inhabitants called the Winkies and predominates in the local surroundings. The Winkies are relatively normal in appearance with the exception of their yellow-tinted skin. Tin abounds there and it is said that the Winkies are some of the most skillful tinsmiths in the world. This was the country once ruled by the malevolent Wicked Witch of the West before Dorothy Gale &quot;melted&quot; her with a bucket of water, as narrated in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. After that, the Winkies asked the Tin Woodman to be their new monarch ruler which he gladly accepted. He now lives in a vast palace made of tin that his loyal subjects built in his honor as a present for their new king.

==Etymology==
Michael Patrick Hearn suggests the name Winkie means &quot;a little bit of light,&quot; referring to the country &quot;where the sun sets.&quot;

==The Classic Oz books==
The publishing company Reilly &amp; Britton (later Reilly &amp; Lee) published, in the form of end-papers to the first edition of &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914), the only authenticated map (reproduced here) that shows the Land of Oz in its entirety. For some undiscovered reason this map flip-flops the directions of east and west. The West and East subsection of the Wikipedia article on the Land of Oz discusses this error and the resulting contradictions. The revised version of the map published by the International Wizard of Oz Club corrects the directions and reverses the map. The map represents the entire area between the Winkie Country and the southern border of Oz as belonging to Quadling Country. The west country of Oz is bordered at the northeast by the Gillikin Country and to the south by the Quadling Country.

To the East lies the Emerald City and to the far east (beyond the Munchkin Country) as well as to the west, north and south (beyond the Quadling Country) of Winkie Country lies the Deadly Desert (which completely surrounds the Land of Oz). The Winkie Country is separated by the Deadly Desert from the underground Dominions of the Nome King. The Kingdom of Oogaboo, where items of value grow on trees, is separated from the Winkie Country by a mountain range. (&quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot;)

The Black Forest is in the southern part of the Winkie Country. Gloma, the good witch, rules there (&quot;The Wishing Horse of Oz&quot;).

In some of the Oz books by Ruth Plumly Thompson, the geography is inverted, with the Winkie Country in the Eastern part of Oz and the Munchkin Country in the West.

==Political organization==
The Winkie Country&#x27;s many cities and kingdoms each have their own ruler, who in turn are subjects of the Tin Woodman, Nick Chopper, who himself acknowledges Ozma as supreme ruler of Oz.

==Locations and inhabitants==

Like all the countries of Oz, the Winkie Country contains various unusual sights, creatures, and places. Among them are:

* Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s Castle – This was where the Wicked Witch of the West ruled over the Winkies until she was melted by Dorothy.
* Tin Palace – A palace that is made out of tin. The Tin Woodman moved from the Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s castle because it was too damp.
* Jack Pumpkinhead&#x27;s House – Jack Pumpkinhead lives in a giant hollowed-out pumpkin near the Tin Woodman&#x27;s palace in Winkie Country.
* Scarecrow&#x27;s Mansion – Jack designed a five story, jewel-encrusted mansion for the Scarecrow, shaped like an ear of corn.
* Bear Center – A forest where the stuffed bears live. They are ruled by the Lavender Bear and are guided by the mechanical Little Pink Bear.
* Bewilderness - A wild place where the rocks, shrubs, and trees change places making it difficult for anyone to travel through. It was seen in &quot;The Gnome King of Oz&quot;.
* Corabia - A kingdom along the northern edge of Winkie Country that is bordered by the Deadly Desert. Unlike Samandra, Corabia is a fertile land. The Sultan of Samandra once turned its inhabitants into fish until it was undone by Speedy and his friends.
* Corumbia - A kingdom along the northern edge of Winkie Country that is bordered by the Deadly Desert and is east of Samandra. The Sultan of Samandra once turned its inhabitants into plants and trees until it was undone by Speedy and his friends.
* Great Orchard – This lies between the Cities of Thi and Herku.
* Herku – A city ruled by Vig that has a strange master/slave society. It is square with gates of burnished copper in each of the four walls of the city. The residents of Herku use a small dose of Zosozo (a specially-compounded substance that is made of pure energy) that makes the residents skeletally thin and immensely strong enough to keep a breed of giants as their slaves.
* Marsh Land – A swampy location that is one muddy area. It is the home of the Sticks-in-the-Muds, a tribe of mud-covered people on stilts. Travelers are often told to evade Marsh Land.
* Merry-Go-Mountains – A bunch of mountains that whirl swiftly and are made of rubber.
* Monday Mountain - A steep mountain in Winkie Country which seems to be really a hill. Its inhabitants are an all-female race called the Tubbies who spend their days washing and cleaning while awaiting a man to come and marry their ruler Pearl Borax. Monday Mountain is surrounded by a rotating fence that would only stop if someone says &quot;stop.&quot;

* Oogaboo – Oogaboo is located in the far northwestern corner of Winkie Country, within a mountain range that separates it from the rest of Winkie Country. It is ruled by Queen Ann Soforth, daughter and successor to King Jol Jemkiph Soforth, who abdicated. Oogaboo is one of the smallest and poorest kingdoms in the Land of Oz, despite the cultivation of trees which produce many items of value.
* Patch – A patchy-little kingdom south of Oogaboo. It is inhabited by the Quilties whose main occupation is the manufacture of patchwork quilts &quot;(The Gnome King of Oz)&quot;.
* Perhaps City – A city that is on Maybe Mountain. It was seen in &quot;Grampa in Oz.&quot;
* Play - A fenced-off area in Winkie Country. Its people are called the Pierrettes and Pierots where they are ruled by King Capers and have a rough and tumble personality.
* Remote Tableland – A small community that is in the far southwestern corner of Winkie Country. It is home to the Yips who resemble the Hyups from Mount Munch in having no regular contact with the citizens of Oz below their plateau (as seen in &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot;).
* Samandra - A dry desert-like kingdom that is at the far-northern edge of the Deadly Desert where slavery is practiced. Samandra is ruled by the Sultan of Samandra.
* Suds - A kingdom that is composed of soap and other bath-associated things.. It is ruled by Sultan Shampoozle and the inhabitants who are as big as a child don&#x27;t like outsiders.
* Thi – A city that is a relatively unexplored part of Oz. It is surrounded by shifting fields that send a traveler in the opposite direction. The inhabitants of the city of Thi are called Thists. They have diamond-shaped heads and heart-shaped bodies. Their stomachs and throats are lined with gold allowing them to eat the thistles that grow around their city. They use mechanical dragons to pull their chariots.
* The Tottenhots – A race of small sprite-like people who sleep during the day and play at night that live in Winkie Country..
* Truth Pond – A pond that is located near the Deadly Desert. Anyone can bathe in and be freed of an enchantment, but must always afterward tell the truth.
* Tune Town - A kingdom surrounded by a wall that is ruled by Queen Jazzma. The wall contains a piano for a gate that must play to find the right chord to enter Tune Town. Normal talking and walking is not allowed except during intermission. To leave Tune Town, one must sing out of tune.
* Wackajammy – The breadbasket of the West. It was seen in &quot;Yankee in Oz.&quot;
* Wish Ways - A dusty road in different parts of Winkie Country where its dust can grant any wishes.

==In film==
The most famous depiction of the Winkies is in the 1939 musical film where they appear as the regimental army of the Wicked Witch of the West, marching in formation and chanting repeatedly. In the film, the Winkies bear little or no resemblance to their literary counterparts, dressing in blue uniforms based loosely on the uniforms of the Russian streltsy of some three and a half centuries earlier, and having green skin and pointed noses much like the Wicked Witch herself, and they are never referred to as Winkies in the film. The Winkie Country is only shown at night in the film, with the main colors being blue, black and gray. The scenery is very bleak and barren, with many mountains and rock formations.

==In other works==
In Gregory Maguire&#x27;s revisionist Oz novels &quot;&quot; and &quot;Son of a Witch&quot;, this area is called the Vinkus, and it is revealed that &quot;Winkie&quot; is considered a derogatory term. The treatment of the people of the Vinkus by the Wizard closely parallels that of Native Americans by the United States government. The Vinkus is the largest of the four provinces, extending totally from south to north and standing on western Oz. This region is also almost completely isolated from the rest of the country, as it is bordered by deserts at north, west and south, and obstructed to the east by the Great and Lesser Kells mountain ranges, with the only way in Kumbricia&#x27;s Pass. The Vinkus is the least populated and least fertile land of Maguire&#x27;s Oz as well, being portrayed as a semi-desolated place with vast extenses of grasslands, mountains and deserts, with its largest lake, Kellswater, described as toxic and lifeless. The Vinkus River runs up to Kiamo Ko, home of the Tigelaar Family, leaders of the Arkiji Tribe and the only permanent settlement in the region. There are other places mentioned as well, such as Nether How, a group of diminute lakes, Applepress Farm, an abandoned warehouse formerly used by the maunts of Gillikin, The Thursk Desert, The Sour Sands, The Thousand Year Grasslands, a hunting place, Ugabu, disputed land in northern Vinkus and Kvon Altar, a strange place that is used as a sacred sanctuary by a dark occultist religion that is said to worship death. It is rumored that there are many underground water springs in the Vinkus.

It is inhabited by several semi-nomadic tribes, including the Scrow, the Yunamata, and the Arjiki. 
Metallica sampled the chants of the Winkie guards outside the Wicked Witch&#x27;s castle from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; film on the intro to the track &quot;The Frayed Ends of Sanity&quot; on their 1988 album &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;. The chants were also heard in the Experience Unlimited song &quot;Da Butt&quot;.

In the 1995 television special &quot;The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True&quot; which is based on the 1939 film, the Winkies appear without being dressed similar to Russian guards and holding pikes, but perform their chant until Dorothy melts the Wicked Witch (Debra Winger).

In West End&#x27;s version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; musical, the marching music introduction and chant are both heard in the musical&#x27;s first song, &quot;Nobody Understands Me&quot;. It is performed by the Kansas farm workers Zeke, Hickory, and Hunk.

<text>The Internationalist Communist Union (ICU; French: &quot;Union Communiste Internationaliste&quot;) is an international grouping of Trotskyist political parties, centred on Lutte Ouvrière in France.

It believes that the socialist transformation of society can be accomplished only by the working class, consciously fighting in its own class interests, and therefore that the task of revolutionary groups is to construct a working class revolutionary party. The ICU believes that the only possible programmatic basis for revolutionaries rests on Marxist ideas in the tradition of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and its Bolshevik leaders Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. The ICU focus their activities, whether propaganda or intervention, within the working class.

<text>Yeosu, formerly romanized as Yosu, is the second largest city in South Jeolla Province, South Korea. In 1998, the Old Yeosu City, Yeocheon City and Yeocheon County were merged and the current city, Yeosu, was formed.

==Characteristics==
The city of Yeosu consists of the Yeosu peninsula as well as 365 islands (48 inhabited, 317 uninhabited). Being midway along the southern coast of South Korea, it is flanked by Namhae County in South Gyeongsang Province to the east with a natural waterway, and the Bay of Suncheon to the west and northwest, the city of Suncheon sprawling along its banks. On 1 April 1998, the cities of Yeosu and Yeocheon, along with Yeocheon County merged to form the unified city of Yeosu.

It has a number of islands in its jurisdiction, including the uninhabited Janggundo, Dolsando, and the park island Jangdo.

== Etymology ==
The place name &quot;Yeosu&quot; first appears in the &quot;Samguk Sagi Jiriji&quot; with the record: &quot;Haeeup-hyeon (海邑縣) was originally Baekje&#x27;s Wonzon-hyeon (猿村縣), but King Gyeongdeok changed its name. It is now Yeosu-hyeon (麗水縣) in Goryeo.&quot; In both &quot;Dongramdo(part of&quot; Donggukyeojiseungram)and &quot;Dongyeobigo&quot; (Jeollado&#x27;s part), the name &quot;Suyoung&quot; (水營) is noted on the southern peninsula south of Suncheon and Gwangyang. This is believed to be because Jeollado&#x27;s Jwasuyoung (Joseon Dynasty&#x27;s Naval Headquarters for eastern sector of Jeolla Province) was established in this region starting in 1479 (the 10th year of King Seongjong&#x27;s reign). Subsequently, most old maps depict it as &quot;Yeosu&quot; (呂水), written differently from the current Hanja. Specifically, in the &quot;Haedongdo&quot; (Suncheon) map, Jwasuyoung appears south of Yeosumyeon (呂水面).

== History ==
=== Neolithic period ===
The Neolithic sites in Yeosu were excavated and investigated by the National Gwangju Museum from 1989 to 1990. The artifacts unearthed include various types of pottery such as Yunggimong pottery, Apinmung pottery, Chimsunmung pottery, Jeomnyeolmung pottery, Juchil pottery, and Mummun pottery, as well as stone tools including milgae (hammerstones), jjikkgae (flint tools), jargegae (sickles), geukkeogae (scraping tools), saegigae (engraving tools), doggi (axes), galdol (grinding stones), and suttol (whetstones). Additionally, two residential sites were investigated.

The residential sites were constructed by compacting clay over shell layers, with diameters ranging from 460 to 540 centimeters, and featured a circular, flat layout equipped with round kilns. Notably, at the first residential site, a set of tools including a moru-dol (grindstone), galpan (grinding plate), and another galdol (grinding stone) were found near the kiln area. These tools allowed for the crushing or grinding of materials to produce powder, which drew significant attention. The radiocarbon dating of the Songdo shell mound indicated an age of 4285±195 BP and 4270±200 B.C.

In 1992 and 1993, surface surveys were conducted in the islands of Yeosu, leading to the additional investigation of 22 Neolithic shell mounds and 3 artifact dispersal sites. This revealed that the island regions of Yeosu, along with the coastal areas of South Gyeongsang Province, were cultural centers of the Neolithic period. The site locations were predominantly situated in bays suitable for various shellfish habitats, being safe from sea winds and featuring well-developed shell pits. The collected artifacts were similar to those unearthed from the Songdo shell mound, and a considerable number of Yunggimong pottery, which is dated to a relatively early period, were excavated.

=== Proto Three Kingdoms Period ===
In the Yeosu region during the Proto Three Kingdoms Period period, there appears to have been Wonji-guk (爰池國), one of the Mahan confederations. However, in the late 4th century, as Baekje expanded its power, several small states located in the present-day Jeollanam-do region came under Baekje&#x27;s influence. Baekje did not immediately reorganize these small states into counties (郡縣) or dispatch local governors. Instead, Baekje recognized the authority of the chieftains of these small states and exercised indirect control through them by collecting tributes. It is believed that the Yeosu region was incorporated into Baekje under such circumstances.

=== Three Kingdoms Period ===
In the mid-5th century, Baekje&#x27;s national power was significantly weakened due to Goguryeo&#x27;s southward expansion. Additionally, as the Gaya Kingdom advanced into the lower regions of the Namyun and Seomjin rivers, the eastern part of Jeollanam-do was temporarily incorporated into Daegaya (Great Gaya). In 538, Baekje moved its capital to Sabi-seong and divided the entire country into five regions (五方) centered around the central, eastern, western, southern, and northern areas. In each region, Baekje established Bangseong (方城) and governed through these large and small fortresses, managing them as counties (郡) or prefectures (縣). In the southern region, now corresponding to Suncheon, Yeosu, and Gwangyang areas, Sapyeong-gun (歃平郡) was established.

Within Sapyeong-gun, there were three counties: Wonzon (猿村), Maro (馬老), and Dolsan (突山). Wonzon-hyeon (猿村縣) covered the Yeosu Peninsula, while Dolsan-hyeon (突山縣) included Dolsan-do and nearby islands. From this time, the Yeosu region saw the first establishment of counties named Wonzon and Dolsan.

Representative Baekje-era relics remaining in Yeosu include mountain fortresses such as Woram Mountain Fortress located in Dolsan Pyeongsari, Temi Mountain Fortress in Seonwon-dong, Jasan Mountain Fortress in Olim-dong, Gorak Mountain Fortress in Munsu-dong, and Jukpo-ri Bon Mountain Fortress in Dolsan. However, in 660, Baekje was defeated by Silla, and the Yeosu region was incorporated into Silla&#x27;s territory.

=== Unified Silla Period ===
After the unification of the Three Kingdoms, Silla reorganized its local administrative structures to govern the expanded territories. The reorganization began around 677 (the 17th year of King Munmu&#x27;s reign), after expelling the Tang forces, and continued through 687 (the 7th year of King Sinmun&#x27;s reign), culminating in the establishment of the Nine Provinces and Five Subordinate Capitals (九州五小京) system. This system allowed Silla to directly control both the former territories of Baekje and Goguryeo and its own territories from the central government by dispatching administrators to the regions. In December 757 (the 16th year of King Gyeongdeok&#x27;s reign), the names of the nine provinces and their counties were changed to Hanja names.

Silla&#x27;s land was divided into provinces (주/ju/州), counties (군/gun/郡), and prefectures (현/hyun/縣), establishing a pyramid-shaped administrative structure with nine provinces. Each province contained counties under them, which were further divided into prefectures. To manage the ruling elites of the conquered regions during the unification process, the provinces were divided into three sub-provinces each, forming a nine-province administration system. Among these, one of the provinces, Muju (武州, also known as Mujinju), governed the present-day Jeollanam-do region. Seungpyeong-gun (昇平郡) within Muju consisted of three hyeon (郡縣), maintaining the same names as in Baekje: Haeeup-hyeon (海邑縣, Yeosu), Yeosan-hyeon (廬山縣, Dolsan), and Heeyang-hyeon (晞陽縣, Gwangyang). Consequently, during the Unified Silla period, the Yeosu region, excluding Samsan-myeon, consisted of Haeeup-hyeon (Yeosu) and Yeosan-hyeon (Dolsan).

Meanwhile, in the Gohung-gun area, Bunchagun (分領郡) was renamed to Bunryeong-gun (分領郡), Jojo-rye-hyeon (조조례縣) was renamed to Chungnyeol-hyeon (忠烈縣), Duhi-hyeon (두힐縣) was renamed to Gangwon-hyeon (薑原縣), and Bisa-hyeon (比史縣) was renamed to Baekju-hyeon. As a result, Samsan-myeon became Gangwon-hyeon (薑原縣).

In 892 (the 6th year of Queen Jinseong&#x27;s reign), during the chaotic end of the Unified Silla period, Gyeon Hwon established his kingdom with Mujinju as his base, thereby bringing it under the influence of Later Baekje. Around this time, local Yeosu hojoks (호족/korean quasi nobility-gentry), such as Kim Chong (金摠), joined the Later Baekje forces. Conversely, the Dolsan area was under the control of Wang Bongkyu (王逢規) of Gangju (康州).

=== Goryeo dynasty ===
In 940 (the 23rd year of King Taejo&#x27;s reign), the national administrative divisions were again reorganized into (주, &quot;ju&quot;),(부, &quot;bu&quot;),(군, &quot;gun&quot;), and (현, &quot;hyeon&quot;)-the addition of &quot;부/bu&quot;. As a result, the Yeosu region, which was previously known as Haeeup-hyeon (海邑縣, Yeosu) and Yeosan-hyeon (廬山縣, Dolsan) during the Unified Silla period, was renamed to Yeosu-hyeon (麗水縣) and Dolsan-hyeon (突山縣) respectively. Although the name Yeosu (麗水) appeared for the first time at this point, both areas were still under the jurisdiction of Seungpyeong-gun (昇平郡, Suncheon).

Even in the early Goryeo period, remnants of militarized local powers remained in the regions. By the time of King Seongjong, the entire country had transitioned into a centralized governance system. Prior to this centralization, except for the western capital Seogyeong(modern day Pyongyang), Daedohobus(대도호부/大都護府), &#x27;jin&#x27; s (), &#x27;ju&#x27; s (주), &#x27;bu&#x27; s (), &#x27;gun&#x27; s (), and &#x27;hyun&#x27; s () did not have residential governors dispatched from the central government. Instead, semi-autonomous organizations known as hyangho were entrusted with local administration, while central officers such as Geumyoo (금유/今有) and Jo-jang (조장/租藏), responsible for tax collection, and Jeonunsa (전운사/轉運使), responsible for delivering the collected taxes to the central government, were periodically dispatched to tour the regions.

Starting in 983 (the 2nd year of King Seongjong&#x27;s reign), residential governors (목사/&quot;moksa/牧使&quot;) were officially dispatched following the establishment of twelve &#x27;mok&#x27;s (牧) in the regions. These moksas were assigned to twelve provinces: Gwangju (廣州), Yangju, Chungju, Cheongju, Gongju, Jinju, Sangju, Jeonju, Naju, Hwangju, and Haeju. Their role was to oversee their respective provinces and the local administrative units (hyangjip/鄕職) within the counties and districts. The exact boundaries and the number of hyangjip under each mok were not documented.

In the South Jeolla Province region, the province of Muju (武州, also known as Mujinju)—one of the nine provinces of Unified Silla—was dissolved and replaced by Naju and Seungju (昇州, Suncheon) as part of the twelve mok. At this time, Yeosu was under the jurisdiction of Seungju.

In 995 (the 14th year of King Seongjong&#x27;s reign), the administrative divisions were reorganized once again. The nation was divided into four Daedohobus(대도호부/大都護府) and ten provinces (도/do). Additionally, the twelve mok were transformed into twelve joldo-sa ()s. The ten provinces were Gwannae (), Jungwon (), Hanan (), Gangnam (), Haeyang (), Yeongnam (), Yeongdong (), Sannam (), Sakbang (), and Paeseo (). The Jeollanam-do region fell under Haeyang-do (海陽道), and Yeosu was governed by Seungju Joldo-sa (昇州節度使), overseeing Yeosu-hyeon (麗水縣) and Dolsan-hyeon (突山縣).

In 1018 (the 9th year of King Hyeonjong&#x27;s reign), another reorganization took place, dividing the country into four Daedohobus(대도호부/大都護府), eight moks (8목; Gwangju, Chungju, Cheongju, Jinju, Sangju, Jeonju, Naju, Hwangju), fifty-six &#x27;ji-gun-sa&#x27; s(56주지군사), twenty-eight &#x27;jin-jang&#x27; s (28진장), and twenty &#x27;hyun-young&#x27; s (20현령). This reorganization resulted in Naju becoming one of the eight moks. At this time, Yeosu-hyeon and Dolsan-hyeon were incorporated into Seungpyeong-gun (昇平郡) under Naju and continued to exist until the late Goryeo period. Dolsan-hyeon was temporarily abolished but was reestablished. In 1350 (the 2nd year of King Chungjeong&#x27;s reign) it was promoted to Juyeop (),separated from Suncheonbu () and became an independent administrative entity, continuing for 47 years until the early Joseon period in 1396 (the 5th year of King Taejo&#x27;s reign). Additionally, during the Goryeo period, the Yeosu region included other areas such as Sam-ilpo-hyang, Jinrye-bugok, and Sora-po-bugok alongside Yeosu-hyeon and Dolsan-hyeon.

=== Joseon dynasty ===
Beginning in 1479, the Joseon Dynasty&#x27;s Naval Headquarters for eastern sector of Jeolla Province was located there. As such, it was the first base where Admiral Yi Sun-sin&#x27;s fleet was based during the Imjin War which used the Turtle Ship or &#x27;Kobukseon&#x27; which was built in Seon-so.

=== Recent history ===

==== Yeosu Rebellion ====
In October 1948, the town of Yeosu was taken by South Korean soldiers who refused to take part in the suppression of the ongoing Jeju Uprising.

On December 25, 1920, Yeosu Station started to operate as a railway that connects &quot;Yeosu&quot; and &quot;Gwangju&quot;. On October 1, 2011, however, the station was relocated to &quot;Deokchung-dong&quot; and renamed Yeosu Expo station, as the venue served for Yeosu World Expo in 2012.

In the 142nd General Assembly of BIE, held in Paris on 26 November 2007, the global community selected Yeosu as the host city for the 2012 World Expo. This was Korea&#x27;s second World Expo, following Daejeon&#x27;s 1993 Fair.

<doc id="386397" wikidata="Q1369166" url="?curid=386397" title="List of Sega Genesis games">
<text>The Sega Genesis, known as the in regions outside of North America, is a 16-bit video game console that was designed and produced by Sega. First released in Japan on October 29, 1988, in North America on August 14, 1989, and in PAL regions in 1990, the Genesis is Sega&#x27;s third console and the successor to the Master System. The system supports a library of officially licensed games created both by Sega and a wide array of third-party publishers and delivered on ROM cartridges. It can also play Master System games when the separately sold Power Base Converter is installed. The Sega Genesis also sported numerous peripherals, including the Sega CD and 32X, several network services, and multiple first-party and third-party variations of the console that focused on extending its functionality. The console and its games continue to be popular among fans, collectors, video game music fans, and emulation enthusiasts. Licensed third party re-releases of the console are still being produced, and several indie game developers continue to produce games for it. Many games have also been re-released in compilations for newer consoles and offered for download on various digital distribution services, such as Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam.

The Genesis library was initially modest, but eventually grew to contain games to appeal to all types of players. The initial pack-in title was &quot;Altered Beast&quot;, which was later replaced with &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Top sellers included &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, its sequel &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, and &quot;Disney&#x27;s Aladdin&quot;. During development for the console, Sega Enterprises in Japan focused on developing action games while Sega of America was tasked with developing sports games. A large part of the appeal of the Genesis library during the console&#x27;s lifetime was the arcade-based experience of its games, as well as more difficult entries such as &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; and sports games such as &quot;Joe Montana Football&quot;. Compared to its competition, Sega advertised to an older audience by hosting more mature games, including the uncensored version of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;.

Titles listed do not include releases for the Sega CD and 32X add-ons, or titles released through the online service Sega Meganet in Japan. Included in this list are titles not licensed by Sega, including releases in Taiwan by several developers such as Gamtec, as well as releases by Accolade before being licensed following the events of &quot;Sega v. Accolade&quot;. This list also includes titles developed by unlicensed third-party developers after the discontinuation of the Genesis, such as &quot;Pier Solar and the Great Architects&quot;.

A few games were only released exclusively on the Sega Channel subscription service, which was active from 1994 to 1998, in the US. This means that, whilst cartridges were officially released for use on PAL and Japanese consoles, they were unavailable physically in the US. While few games were released this way, some of them are considered to be staples in the Genesis library, such as &quot;Pulseman&quot; and &quot;Mega Man: The Wily Wars&quot;.

<doc id="386398" wikidata="Q1143445" url="?curid=386398" title="Hypothetico-deductive model">
<text>The hypothetico-deductive model or method is a proposed description of the scientific method. According to it, scientific inquiry proceeds by formulating a hypothesis in a form that can be falsifiable, using a test on observable data where the outcome is not yet known. A test outcome that could have and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis. A test outcome that could have, but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory. It is then proposed to compare the explanatory value of competing hypotheses by testing how stringently they are corroborated by their predictions.

==Example==

One example of an algorithmic statement of the hypothetico-deductive method is as follows:
:1. Use your experience: Consider the problem and try to make sense of it. Gather data and look for previous explanations. If this is a new problem to you, then move to step 2.
:2. Form a conjecture (hypothesis): When nothing else is yet known, try to state an explanation, to someone else, or to your notebook.
:3. Deduce predictions from the hypothesis: if you assume 2 is true, what consequences follow?
:4. Test (or experiment): Look for evidence (observations) that conflict with these predictions in order to disprove 2. It is a fallacy or error in one&#x27;s reasoning to seek  3 directly as proof of 2. This formal fallacy is called &quot;affirming the consequent&quot;.
One possible sequence in this model would be 1, 2, 3, 4. If the outcome of 4 holds, and 3 is not yet disproven, you may continue with 3, 4, 1, and so forth; but if the outcome of 4 shows 3 to be false, you will have to go back to 2 and try to invent a new 2, deduce a new 3, look for 4, and so forth.

Note that this method can never absolutely verify (prove the truth of) 2. It can only falsify 2. (This is what Einstein meant when he said, &quot;No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.&quot;)

==Discussion==
Additionally, as pointed out by Carl Hempel (1905–1997), this simple view of the scientific method is incomplete; a conjecture can also incorporate probabilities, e.g., the drug is effective about 70% of the time. Tests, in this case, must be repeated to substantiate the conjecture (in particular, the probabilities). In this and other cases, we can quantify a probability for our confidence in the conjecture itself and then apply a Bayesian analysis, with each experimental result shifting the probability either up or down. Bayes&#x27; theorem shows that the probability will never reach exactly 0 or 100% (no absolute certainty in either direction), but it can still get very close to either extreme. See also confirmation holism.

Qualification of corroborating evidence is sometimes raised as philosophically problematic. The raven paradox is a famous example. The hypothesis that &#x27;all ravens are black&#x27; would appear to be corroborated by observations of only black ravens. However, &#x27;all ravens are black&#x27; is logically equivalent to &#x27;all non-black things are non-ravens&#x27; (this is the contrapositive form of the original implication). &#x27;This is a green tree&#x27; is an observation of a non-black thing that is a non-raven and therefore corroborates &#x27;all non-black things are non-ravens&#x27;. It appears to follow that the observation &#x27;this is a green tree&#x27; is corroborating evidence for the hypothesis &#x27;all ravens are black&#x27;. Attempted resolutions may distinguish:
* non-falsifying observations as to strong, moderate, or weak corroborations
* investigations that do or do not provide a potentially falsifying test of the hypothesis.

Evidence contrary to a hypothesis is itself philosophically problematic. Such evidence is called a falsification of the hypothesis. However, under the theory of confirmation holism it is always possible to save a given hypothesis from falsification. This is so because any falsifying observation is embedded in a theoretical background, which can be modified in order to save the hypothesis. Karl Popper acknowledged this but maintained that a critical approach respecting methodological rules that avoided such &quot;immunizing stratagems&quot; is conducive to the progress of science.

Physicist Sean Carroll claims the model ignores underdetermination.

===Versus other research models===

The hypothetico-deductive approach contrasts with other research models such as the inductive approach or grounded theory. In the data percolation methodology, 
the hypothetico-deductive approach is included in a paradigm of pragmatism by which four types of relations between the variables can exist: descriptive, of influence, longitudinal or causal. The variables are classified in two groups, structural and functional, a classification that drives the formulation of hypotheses and the statistical tests to be performed on the data so as to increase the efficiency of the research.

<text>John Bernard Burnheim (20 April 1927 – 26 October 2023) was an Australian philosopher who was Professor of General Philosophy at the University of Sydney.

==Biography==
John Bernard Burnheim was born in Sydney on 20 April 1927. He was originally a Catholic priest and, from 1958 to 1968, was rector of St John&#x27;s, the Catholic college attached to the university. He became a major figure in the disturbances of the 1970s that split the university&#x27;s Department of Philosophy. Burnheim died in Camperdown on 26 October 2023, at the age of 96.

==Sortition==

=== &quot;Is Democracy Possible? The alternative to electoral politics&quot; ===
In his book &quot;Is Democracy Possible? The alternative to electoral politics&quot; (1985) Burnheim used the term &quot;demarchy&quot; (created by Friedrich Hayek in his Law, Legislation and Liberty) to describe a political system without the state or bureaucracies, and based instead on randomly selected groups of decision makers. This has striking resemblances to classical democratic ideas, as reported by Thucydides. In 2006 Burnheim published a second edition with a new preface in which he directed the reader to an emphasis that &quot;a polity organised by negotiation between specialised authorities would work much better than one based on centralised authority&quot;.

Demarchy as Burnheim conceives it has two features that distinguish it from other proposals for selection by lot in politics:

*First, an insistence on putting distinct policy areas under mutually independent authorities which would settle problems of coordination between them by negotiation or arbitration rather than by dictation from above. The point of this is to remedy the defect of existing democracies in which issues are settled according to the power strategies of politicians rather than the merits of the case;
*Second, that the committee in charge of each policy body should be statistically representative of those who are most substantially affected by their decisions. The hope is that this would lead to better decisions, not just the wishful thinking of populist spin.

=== &quot;The Demarchy Manifesto: for better public policy&quot; ===
In 2016 John Burnheim published &quot;The Demarchy Manifesto: for better public policy.&quot; Where &quot;Is Democracy Possible&quot; is theoretical, the manifesto suggests a practical approach to current problems, aimed at divorcing the process of &quot;enlightening, articulating and giving effect to public opinion&quot; on selected issues of policy from the electoral party system. It envisaged setting up a public foundation, financed by private contributions, to conduct the proceedings, relying on the complete transparency and participatory amplitude of its proceedings to justify its claim to articulate a view that deserves to be seen as serious public opinion on a range of important matters. The key to complete openness is a website where anybody who chooses to do so may contribute, dedicated to deciding the best way of dealing with a specific problem. Contributors would be expected to appeal to considerations that most people would accept as directly relevant to the particular problem. The editors would attempt to see that all the considerations that either ordinary people or experts might have were thoroughly debated, establishing the considerations a good solution should take into account. That discussion should lead to clarity about just what facts and values are relevant, but still leave a lot of disagreement about the relative weight placed on them in articulating an acceptable decision. A second small body would be charged with attempting to arrive at a practical compromise between conflicting considerations. The suggestion is that this should be a small committee, statistically representative of the interests most strongly advantaged or disadvantaged by what is to be decided. This body would also operate entirely by correspondence online, open to comment at every stage. The book tries to tie this proposal up with a realistic approach to the more general issues of public goods, practical uncertainty, social processes and global problems.

<text>In geology, horst and graben (or range and valley) refers to topography consisting of alternating raised and lowered fault blocks known as horsts and grabens. The features are created by normal faulting and rifting caused by crustal extension. Horst and graben are formed when normal faults of opposite dip occur in pairs with parallel strike, and are always formed together. Each feature can range in size from a few centimeters up to tens of kilometers, and the vertical displacement can be up to several thousand meters. The movement on either side of each block is typically equal, resulting in little tilting.

== Features ==

=== Horst ===

A horst is a section of crust that has been lifted relative to the blocks on either side, which is a result of its bounding faults dipping away from each other. Horsts can form features such as plateaus, mountain ranges or ridges on either side of the valleys.

=== Graben ===

A graben is a section of crust that has lowered relative to the blocks on either side, which is a result of its bounding faults dipping towards each other. The plural of graben can be either graben or grabens. Graben form low-lying features such as basins and rift valleys. They can be very long relative to their width.

== Examples ==

* The Basin and Range Province in the western United States is an extensive region of alternating valleys and ridges caused by horst and graben as well as tilted block faulting.

* The Condroz and Ardennes regions of Wallonia are good examples of a succession of horst and graben.

* The Satpura Range is a horst in India and is flanked by Narmada Graben in the north and much smaller but parallel Tapi Graben in the south.

<doc id="386407" wikidata="Q843958" url="?curid=386407" title="Digitization">
<text>Digitization is the process of converting information into a digital (i.e. computer-readable) format. The result is the representation of an object, image, sound, document, or signal (usually an analog signal) obtained by generating a series of numbers that describe a discrete set of points or samples. The result is called &quot;digital representation&quot; or, more specifically, a &quot;digital image&quot;, for the object, and &quot;digital form&quot;, for the signal. In modern practice, the digitized data is in the form of binary numbers, which facilitates processing by digital computers and other operations, but digitizing simply means &quot;the conversion of analog source material into a numerical format&quot;; the decimal or any other number system can be used instead.

Digitization is of crucial importance to data processing, storage, and transmission, because it &quot;allows information of all kinds in all formats to be carried with the same efficiency and also intermingled.&quot; Though analog data is typically more stable, digital data has the potential to be more easily shared and accessed and, in theory, can be propagated indefinitely without generation loss, provided it is migrated to new, stable formats as needed. This potential has led to institutional digitization projects designed to improve access and the rapid growth of the digital preservation field.

Sometimes digitization and digital preservation are mistaken for the same thing. They are different, but digitization is often a vital first step in digital preservation. Libraries, archives, museums, and other memory institutions digitize items to preserve fragile materials and create more access points for patrons. Doing this creates challenges for information professionals and solutions can be as varied as the institutions that implement them. Some analog materials, such as audio and video tapes, are nearing the end of their life cycle, and it is important to digitize them before equipment obsolescence and media deterioration makes the data irretrievable.

There are challenges and implications surrounding digitization including time, cost, cultural history concerns, and creating an equitable platform for historically marginalized voices. Many digitizing institutions develop their own solutions to these challenges.

Mass digitization projects have had mixed results over the years, but some institutions have had success even if not in the traditional Google Books model. Although e-books have undermined the sales of their printed counterparts, a study from 2017 indicated that the two cater to different audiences and use-cases. In a study of over 1400 university students it was found that physical literature is more apt for intense studies while e-books provide a superior experience for leisurely reading.

Technological changes can happen often and quickly, so digitization standards are difficult to keep updated. Professionals in the field can attend conferences and join organizations and working groups to keep their knowledge current and add to the conversation.

== Process ==

The term digitization is often used when diverse forms of information, such as an object, text, sound, image, or voice, are converted into a single binary code. The core of the process is the compromise between the capturing device and the player device so that the rendered result represents the original source with the most possible fidelity, and the advantage of digitization is the speed and accuracy in which this form of information can be transmitted with no degradation compared with analog information.

Digital information exists as one of two digits, either 0 or 1. These are known as bits (a contraction of &quot;binary digits&quot;) and the sequences of 0s and 1s that constitute information are called bytes.

Analog signals are continuously variable, both in the number of possible values of the signal &quot;at&quot; a given time, as well as in the number of points in the signal &quot;in&quot; a given period of time. However, digital signals are discrete in both of those respects – generally a finite sequence of integers – therefore a digitization can, in practical terms, only ever be an approximation of the signal it represents.

Digitization occurs in two parts:
;Discretization: The reading of an analog signal &quot;A&quot;, and, at regular time intervals (frequency), sampling the value of the signal at the point. Each such reading is called a &quot;sample&quot; and may be considered to have infinite precision at this stage;
;Quantization: Samples are rounded to a fixed set of numbers (such as integers), a process known as quantization.
In general, these can occur at the same time, though they are conceptually distinct.

A series of digital integers can be transformed into an analog output that approximates the original analog signal. Such a transformation is called a digital-to-analog conversion. The sampling rate and the number of bits used to represent the integers combine to determine how close such an approximation to the analog signal a digitization will be.

==Examples==

The term is used to describe, for example, the scanning of analog sources (such as printed photos or taped videos) into computers for editing, 3D scanning that creates 3D modeling of an object&#x27;s surface, and audio (where sampling rate is often measured in kilohertz) and texture map transformations. In this last case, as in normal photos, the sampling rate refers to the resolution of the image, often measured in pixels per inch.

Digitizing is the primary way of storing images in a form suitable for transmission and computer processing, whether scanned from two-dimensional analog originals or captured using an image sensor-equipped device such as a digital camera, tomographical instrument such as a CAT scanner, or acquiring precise dimensions from a real-world object, such as a car, using a 3D scanning device.

Digitizing is central to making digital representations of geographical features, using raster or vector images, in a geographic information system, i.e., the creation of electronic maps, either from various geographical and satellite imaging (raster) or by digitizing traditional paper maps or graphs (vector).

&quot;Digitization&quot; is also used to describe the process of populating databases with files or data. While this usage is technically inaccurate, it originates with the previously proper use of the term to describe that part of the process involving digitization of analog sources, such as printed pictures and brochures, before uploading to target databases.

Digitizing may also be used in the field of apparel, where an image may be recreated with the help of embroidery digitizing software tools and saved as embroidery machine code. This machine code is fed into an embroidery machine and applied to the fabric. The most supported format is DST file. Apparel companies also digitize clothing patterns.

== History ==

* 1957 The Standards Electronic Automatic Computer (SEAC) was invented. That same year, Russell Kirsch used a rotating drum scanner and photomultiplier connected to SEAC to create the first digital image (176x176 pixels) from a photo of his infant son. This image was stored in SEAC memory via a staticizer and viewed via a cathode ray oscilloscope.
* 1971 Invention of Charge-Coupled Devices that made conversion from analog data to a digital format easy.
* 1986 work started on the JPEG format.
* 1990s Libraries began scanning collections to provide access via the world wide web.

==Analog signals to digital==

Analog signals are continuous electrical signals; digital signals are non-continuous. Analog signals can be converted to digital signals by using an analog-to-digital converter.

The process of converting analog to digital consists of two parts: sampling and quantizing. Sampling measures wave amplitudes at regular intervals, splits them along the vertical axis, and assigns them a numerical value, while quantizing looks for measurements that are between binary values and rounds them up or down.

Nearly all recorded music has been digitized, and about 12 percent of the 500,000+ movies listed on the Internet Movie Database are digitized and were released on DVD.

Digitization of home movies, slides, and photographs is a popular method of preserving and sharing personal multimedia. Slides and photographs may be scanned quickly using an image scanner, but analog video requires a video tape player to be connected to a computer while the item plays in real time. Slides can be digitized quicker with a slide scanner such as the Nikon Coolscan 5000ED.

Another example of digitization is the VisualAudio process developed by the Swiss &quot;Fonoteca Nazionale&quot; in Lugano, by scanning a high resolution photograph of a record, they are able to extract and reconstruct the sound from the processed image.

Digitization of analog tapes before they degrade, or after damage has already occurred, can rescue the only copies of local and traditional cultural music for future generations to study and enjoy.

==Analog texts to digital==

Academic and public libraries, foundations, and private companies like Google are scanning older print books and applying optical character recognition (OCR) technologies so they can be keyword searched, but as of 2006, only about 1 in 20 texts had been digitized. Librarians and archivists are working to increase this statistic and in 2019 began digitizing 480,000 books published between 1923 and 1964 that had entered the public domain.

Unpublished manuscripts and other rare papers and documents housed in special collections are being digitized by libraries and archives, but backlogs often slow this process and keep materials with enduring historical and research value hidden from most users (see digital libraries). Digitization has not completely replaced other archival imaging options, such as microfilming which is still used by institutions such as the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to provide preservation and access to these resources.

While digital versions of analog texts can potentially be accessed from anywhere in the world, they are not as stable as most print materials or manuscripts and are unlikely to be accessible decades from now without further preservation efforts, while many books manuscripts and scrolls have already been around for centuries. However, for some materials that have been damaged by water, insects, or catastrophes, digitization might be the only option for continued use.

==Library preservation==
In the context of libraries, archives, and museums, digitization is a means of creating digital surrogates of analog materials, such as books, newspapers, microfilm and videotapes, offers a variety of benefits, including increasing access, especially for patrons at a distance; contributing to collection development, through collaborative initiatives; enhancing the potential for research and education; and supporting preservation activities. Digitization can provide a means of preserving the content of the materials by creating an accessible facsimile of the object in order to put less strain on already fragile originals. For sounds, digitization of legacy analog recordings is essential insurance against technological obsolescence. A fundamental aspect of planning digitization projects is to ensure that the digital files themselves are preserved and remain accessible; the term &quot;digital preservation,&quot; in its most basic sense, refers to an array of activities undertaken to maintain access to digital materials over time.

The prevalent Brittle Books issue facing libraries across the world is being addressed with a digital solution for long term book preservation. Since the mid-1800s, books were printed on wood-pulp paper, which turns acidic as it decays. Deterioration may advance to a point where a book is completely unusable. In theory, if these widely circulated titles are not treated with de-acidification processes, the materials upon those acid pages will be lost. As digital technology evolves, it is increasingly preferred as a method of preserving these materials, mainly because it can provide easier access points and significantly reduce the need for physical storage space.

Cambridge University Library is working on the Cambridge Digital Library, which will initially contain digitised versions of many of its most important works relating to science and religion. These include examples such as Isaac Newton&#x27;s personally annotated first edition of his &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; as well as college notebooks and other papers, and some Islamic manuscripts such as a Quran from Tipu Sahib&#x27;s library.

Google, Inc. has taken steps towards attempting to digitize every title with &quot;Google Book Search&quot;. While some academic libraries have been contracted by the service, issues of copyright law violations threaten to derail the project. However, it does provide – at the very least – an online consortium for libraries to exchange information and for researchers to search for titles as well as review the materials.

==Digitization versus digital preservation==

Digitizing something is not the same as digitally preserving it. To digitize something is to create a digital surrogate (copy or format) of an existing analog item (book, photograph, or record) and is often described as converting it from analog to digital, however both copies remain. An example would be scanning a photograph and having the original piece in a photo album and a digital copy saved to a computer. This is essentially the first step in digital preservation which is to maintain the digital copy over a long period of time and making sure it remains authentic and accessible.

Digitization is done once with the technology currently available, while digital preservation is more complicated because technology changes so quickly that a once popular storage format may become obsolete before it breaks. An example is a 5 1/4&quot; floppy drive, computers are no longer made with them and obtaining the hardware to convert a file stored on 5 1/4&quot; floppy disc can be expensive. To combat this risk, equipment must be upgraded as newer technology becomes affordable (about 2 to 5 years), but before older technology becomes unobtainable (about 5 to 10 years).

Digital preservation can also apply to born-digital material, such as a Microsoft Word document or a social media post. In contrast, digitization only applies exclusively to analog materials. Born-digital materials present a unique challenge to digital preservation not only due to technological obsolescence but also because of the inherently unstable nature of digital storage and maintenance. Most websites last between 2.5 and 5 years, depending on the purpose for which they were designed.

The Library of Congress provides numerous resources and tips for individuals looking to practice digitization and digital preservation for their personal collections.

==Digital reformatting==
Digital reformatting is the process of converting analog materials into a digital format as a surrogate of the original. The digital surrogates perform a preservation function by reducing or eliminating the use of the original. Digital reformatting is guided by established best practices to ensure that materials are being converted at the highest quality.

===Digital reformatting at the Library of Congress===
The Library of Congress has been actively reformatting materials for its American Memory project and developed best standards and practices pertaining to book handling during the digitization process, scanning resolutions, and preferred file formats. Some of these standards are:

*The use of ISO 16067-1 and ISO 16067-2 standards for resolution requirements.
*Recommended 400 ppi resolution for OCR&#x27;ed printed text.
*The use of 24-bit color when color is an important attribute of a document.
*The use of the scanning device&#x27;s maximum resolution for digitally reproducing photographs
*TIFF as the standard file format.
*Attachment of descriptive, structural, and technical metadata to all digitized documents.

A list of archival standards for digital preservation can be found on the ARL website.

The Library of Congress has constituted a Preservation Digital Reformatting Program. The Three main components of the program include:
*Selection Criteria for digital reformatting
*Digital reformatting principles and specifications
*Life cycle management of LC digital data

== Audio digitization and reformatting ==
Audio media offers a rich source of historic ethnographic information, with the earliest forms of recorded sound dating back to 1890. According to the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA), these sources of audio data, as well as the aging technologies used to play them back, are in imminent danger of permanent loss due to degradation and obsolescence. These primary sources are called “carriers” and exist in a variety of formats, including wax cylinders, magnetic tape, and flat discs of grooved media, among others. Some formats are susceptible to more severe, or quicker, degradation than others. For instance, lacquer discs suffer from delamination. Analog tape may deteriorate due to sticky shed syndrome.

Archival workflow and file standardization have been developed to minimize loss of information from the original carrier to the resulting digital file as digitization is underway. For most at-risk formats (magnetic tape, grooved cylinders, etc.), a similar workflow can be observed. Examination of the source carrier will help determine what, if any, steps need to be taken to repair material prior to transfer. A similar inspection must be undertaken for the playback machines. If satisfactory conditions are met for both carrier and playback machine, the transfer can take place, moderated by an analog-to-digital converter. The digital signal is then represented visually for the transfer engineer by a digital audio workstation, like Audacity, WaveLab, or Pro Tools. Reference access copies can be made at smaller sample rates. For archival purposes, it is standard to transfer at a sample rate of 96 kHz and a bit depth of 24 bits per channel.

== Challenges ==
Many libraries, archives, museums, and other memory institutions, struggle with catching up and staying current regarding digitization and the expectation that everything should already be online. The time spent planning, doing the work, and processing the digital files along with the expense and fragility of some materials are some of the most common.

=== Time spent ===
Digitization is a time-consuming process, even more so when the condition or format of the analog resources requires special handling. Deciding what part of a collection to digitize can sometimes take longer than digitizing it in its entirety. Each digitization project is unique and workflows for one will be different from every other project that goes through the process, so time must be spent thoroughly studying and planning each one to create the best plan for the materials and the intended audience.

=== Expense ===
Cost of equipment, staff time, metadata creation, and digital storage media make large scale digitization of collections expensive for all types of cultural institutions.

Ideally, all institutions want their digital copies to have the best image quality so a high-quality copy can be maintained over time. In the mid-long term, digital storage would be regarded as the more expensive part to maintain the digital archives due to the increasing number of scanning requests. However, smaller institutions may not be able to afford such equipment or manpower, which limits how much material can be digitized, so archivists and librarians must know what their patrons need and prioritize digitization of those items. To help the information institutions to better decide the archives worth of digitization, Casablancas and other researchers used a proposed model to investigate the impact of different digitization strategies on the decrease in access requests in the archival and library reading rooms. Often the cost of time and expertise involved with describing materials and adding metadata is more than the digitization process.

=== Fragility of materials ===
Some materials, such as brittle books, are so fragile that undergoing the process of digitization could damage them irreparably. Despite potential damage, one reason for digitizing fragile materials is because they are so heavily used that creating a digital surrogate will help preserve the original copy long past its expected lifetime and increase access to the item.

=== Copyright ===
Copyright is not only a problem faced by projects like Google Books, but by institutions that may need to contact private citizens or institutions mentioned in archival documents for permission to scan the items for digital collections. It can be time consuming to make sure all potential copyright holders have given permission, but if copyright cannot be determined or cleared, it may be necessary to restrict even digital materials to in library use.

== Solutions ==
Institutions can make digitization more cost-effective by planning before a project begins, including outlining what they hope to accomplish and the minimum amount of equipment, time, and effort that can meet those goals. If a budget needs more money to cover the cost of equipment or staff, an institution might investigate if grants are available.

=== Collaboration ===
Collaborations between institutions have the potential to save money on equipment, staff, and training as individual members share their equipment, manpower, and skills rather than pay outside organizations to provide these services. Collaborations with donors can build long-term support of current and future digitization projects.

=== Outsourcing ===
Outsourcing can be an option if an institution does not want to invest in equipment but since most vendors require an inventory and basic metadata for materials, this is not an option for institutions hoping to digitize without processing.

=== Non-traditional staffing ===
Many institutions have the option of using volunteers, student employees, or temporary employees on projects. While this saves on staffing costs, it can add costs elsewhere such as on training or having to re-scan items due to poor quality.

=== MPLP ===
One way to save time and resources is by using the More Product, Less Process (MPLP) method to digitize materials while they are being processed. Since GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) institutions are already committed to preserving analog materials from special collections, digital access copies do not need to be high-resolution preservation copies, just good enough to provide access to rare materials. Sometimes institutions can get by with 300 dpi JPGs rather than a 600 dpi TIFF for images, and a 300 dpi grayscale scan of a document rather than a color one at 600 dpi.

== Digitizing marginalized voices ==
Digitization can be used to highlight voices of historically marginalized peoples and add them to the greater body of knowledge. Many projects, some community archives created by members of those groups, are doing this in a way that supports the people, values their input and collaboration, and gives them a sense of ownership of the collection. Examples of projects are Gi-gikinomaage-min and the South Asian American Digital Archive (SAADA).

=== Gi-gikinomaage-min ===
Gi-gikinomaage-min is Anishinaabemowin for &quot;We are all teachers&quot; and its main purpose is &quot;to document the history of Native Americans in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&quot; It combines new audio and video oral histories with digitized flyers, posters, and newsletters from Grand Valley State University&#x27;s analog collections. Although not entirely a newly digitized project, what was created also added item-level metadata to enhance context. At the start, collaboration between several university departments and the Native American population was deemed important and remained strong throughout the project.

=== SAADA ===
The South Asian American Digital Archive (SAADA) has no physical building, is entirely digital and everything is handled by volunteers. This archive was started by Michelle Caswell and Samip Mallick and collects a broad variety of materials &quot;created by or about people residing in the United States who trace their  heritage to Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the many South Asian diaspora communities across the globe.&quot; (Caswell, 2015, 2). The collection of digitized items includes private, government, and university held materials.

=== Black Campus Movement Collection (BCM) ===
Kent State University began its BCM collection when it acquired the papers of African American alumnus Lafayette Tolliver, which included about 1,000 photographs that chronicled the black student experience at Kent State from 1968-1971. The collection continues to add materials from the 1960s up to and including the current student body and several oral histories have been added since it debuted. When digitizing the items, it was necessary to work with alumni to create descriptions for the images. This collaboration created changes in local controlled vocabularies the libraries used to create metadata for the images.

== Mass digitization ==

The expectation that everything should be online has led to mass digitization practices, but it is an ongoing process with obstacles that have led to alternatives. As new technology makes automated scanning of materials safer for materials and decreases need for cropping and de-skewing, mass digitization should be able to increase.

=== Obstacles ===
Digitization can be a physically slow process involving selection and preparation of collections that can take years if materials need to be compared for completeness or are vulnerable to damage. Price of specialized equipment, storage costs, website maintenance, quality control, and retrieval system limitations all add to the problems of working on a large scale.

=== Data privacy and security ===
Digitization presents significant challenges related to data privacy and security. As organizations increasingly depend on electronic databases and information systems, their vulnerability to security threats also rises. The risk of data loss rises and cyberattacks can result in significant financial losses and damage the company’s reputation . Therefore, there is a need for better cybersecurity measures and protection of data security and privacy to decrease the risks associated with digitization.

=== Successes ===

==== Digitization on demand ====
Scanning materials as users ask for them, provides copies for others to use and cuts down on repeated copying of popular items. If one part of a folder, document, or book is asked for, scanning the entire object can save time in the future by already having the material access if someone else needs the material. Digitizing on demand can increase volume because time spent on selection and prep has been used on scanning instead.

==== Google Books ====
From the start, Google has concentrated on text rather than images or special collections. Although criticized in the past for poor image quality, selection practices, and lacking long-term preservation plans, their focus on quantity over quality has enabled Google to digitize more books than other digitizers.

== Standards ==
Digitization is not a static field and standards change with new technology, so it is up to digitization managers to stay current with new developments. Although each digitization project is different, common standards in formats, metadata, quality, naming, and file storage should be used to give the best chance of interoperability and patron access. As digitization is often the first step in digital preservation, questions about how to handle digital files should be addressed in institutional standards.

A standard for still images adapted from the Smithsonian digitization standards might include the following:
Resources to create local standards are available from the Society of American Archivists, the Smithsonian, and the Northeast Document Conservation Center.

== Implications ==

=== Cultural heritage concerns ===
Digitization of community archives by indigenous and other marginalized people has led to traditional memory institutions reassessing how they digitize and handle objects in their collections that may have ties to these groups. The topics they are rethinking are varied and include how items are chosen for digitization projects, what metadata to use to convey proper context to be retrievable by the groups they represent, and whether an item should be accessed by the world or just those who the groups originally intended to have access, such as elders. Many navigate these concerns by collaborating with the communities they seek to represent through their digitized collections.

== Lean philosophy ==

The broad use of internet and the increasing popularity of lean philosophy has also increased the use and meaning of &quot;digitizing&quot; to describe improvements in the efficiency of organizational processes. Lean philosophy refers to the approach which considers any use of time and resources, which does not lead directly to creating a product, as waste and therefore a target for elimination. 
This will often involve some kind of Lean process in order to simplify process activities, with the aim of implementing new &quot;lean and mean&quot; processes by digitizing data and activities. Digitization can help to eliminate time waste by introducing wider access to data, or by the implementation of enterprise resource planning systems.

==Fiction==
Works of science-fiction often include the term digitize as the act of transforming people into digital signals and sending them into digital technology. When that happens, the people disappear from the real world and appear in a virtual world (as featured in the cult film &quot;Tron&quot;, the animated series &quot;&quot;, or the late 1980s live-action series &quot;Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future&quot;). In the video game &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot;, the protagonist&#x27;s holographic friend digitizes the player&#x27;s inventory items. One Super Friends cartoon episode showed Wonder Woman and Jayna freeing the world&#x27;s men (including the male super heroes) onto computer tape by the female villainess Medula.

== Mind uploading ==

Mind uploading is the () speculative process of copying a human mind into a digital computer so it can be emulated there. This would require some form of advanced brain scan far more detailed than what is currently possible.

<doc id="386408" wikidata="Q1308100" url="?curid=386408" title="High Street">
<text>High Street is a common street name for the primary business street of a city, town, or village, especially in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth. It implies that it is the focal point for business, especially shopping. It is also a metonym for the retail sector. While many streets, such as Camden High Street (in London), bear this name, streets with similar function but different names are often referred to as &quot;high street&quot;.

With the rapid increase in consumer expenditure, the number of High Streets in England grew from the 17th century and reached a peak in Victorian Britain, where, drawn to growing towns and cities spurred on by the Industrial Revolution, the rate of urbanisation was unprecedented. Since the latter half of the 20th century, the prosperity of High Streets has been in decline due to the growth of out-of-town shopping centres, and, since the early 21st century, the growth of online retailing, forcing many shop closures and prompting the UK government to consider initiatives to reinvigorate and preserve the High Street.

High Street is the most common street name in the UK, which according to a 2009 statistical compilation has 5,410 High Streets, 3,811 Station Roads and 2,702 Main Streets.

==Definition and usage==

In Middle English the word &quot;high&quot; denoted superior rank (&quot;high sheriff&quot;, &quot;Lord High Chancellor&quot;, &quot;high society&quot;). &quot;High&quot; also applied to roads as they improved: &quot;highway&quot; was a new term taken up by the church and their vestries during the 17th century as a term for all public roads between settlements. From the 19th century, which saw a proliferation in the number of public roads, the term &quot;highway&quot; lost its specific meaning, and was legally defined as any public road (e.g., the Highway Code regulates UK public roads). The term &quot;high street&quot; assumed a different meaning, that of a street where the most important shops and businesses were located.

In Britain, the term &#x27;high street&#x27; has both a generic and a specific meaning: people refer to &#x27;shopping on the high street&#x27; both when they mean the main retail area, as well as the specific street of that name. Many former British colonies, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the US region known as New England (especially Massachusetts), adopted the term to refer to retail shopping areas. In other parts of the Northeastern United States, the town&#x27;s main retail street may still be a street named High Street (such as in West Chester, Pennsylvania), but the term is seldom used to refer more generally to a retail street or district. Main street is used in the island of Ireland.

==Incidence==

In Britain, some 3,000 streets called &quot;High Street&quot; and about 2,300 streets with variations on the name (such as Upper High Street, High Street West) have been identified, giving a grand total of approximately 5,300. Of these, more than 600 High Streets are located in London&#x27;s boroughs.

&quot;Main Street&quot; is a term used in smaller towns and villages in Scotland, while in North East England &quot;Front Street&quot; is common. In Cornwall, some places in Devon and some places in the North of England, the equivalent is Fore Street; in some parts of the UK &quot;Market Street&quot; is also used, although sometimes this may be a different area where street markets are currently (or were historically) held.

== History ==

Following the Great Fire of London (1666), the city of London was completely rebuilt. New planning laws, governing rebuilding, designated four types of street based on the size of their carriageways and the types of buildings. Shops were permitted in the principal street or &#x27;high street&#x27;, but not in the by-lanes or back streets. This may have been based on the need for high visibility in order to regulate retail trade, as well as to avoid congestion in the narrow lanes and back streets. Accordingly, from the 17th century, the term &quot;High Street&quot; gradually assumed a narrower meaning and came to describe thoroughfares with significant retail in large villages and towns.

With the rapid increase in consumer expenditure, in the late 17th and 18th centuries the number of High Streets in England increased markedly. Britain also saw an unprecedented growth in urbanisation with people flocking to growing towns and cities. Nurtured by the Industrial Revolution, the department store became a common feature in major High Streets across Britain, with Harding, Howell &amp; Co., opened in 1796 on Pall Mall, London, a contender for the first department store. Founded in London in 1792, bookseller and stationers WHSmith is the world&#x27;s oldest national retail chain. The 19th century was a &quot;golden era&quot; for High Street shops. The rise of the middle class in Victorian England contributed to a more favourable attitude to shopping and consumption. Shopping centres became places to see and be seen, for recreational shopping, and for promenading. By the 20th century, however, the viability of High Streets began to decline.

===Postwar===
In the second half of the 20th century, traditional British High Street precincts came under pressure from out-of-town shopping centres in the United Kingdom, with the balance shifting towards the latter. In the early 21st century, bricks and mortar retailers confronted another major threat from online retailers operating in a global marketplace. To confront this threat, High Street precincts have been forced to evolve; some have become smaller as shops shut their doors, while others have become more like social spaces with a concentration of retail services including cafes, restaurants and entertainment venues while yet others have positioned themselves as more up-market shopping precincts with a preponderance of stores selling luxury branded goods.

In the United Kingdom, geographic concentration of goods and services (including at industrial estates and out of town shopping centres) has reduced the share of the economy contributed to by workers in the high street. High Street refers to only a part of commerce. The town centre in many British towns combines a group of outdoor shopping streets (one or more of which may be pedestrianised), with an adjacent indoor shopping centre.

High Streets through the centuries
==Trends==
The popularity of shopping malls in the mid-20th century, combined with the rise of online retail at the turn of the century has threatened the viability of high street retail precincts.

Initiatives to preserve the traditional British High Street are evident. Research into the customer&#x27;s shopping preferences and patterns reveals that the continued vitality of towns is predicated on a number of different variables. Research has highlighted the ongoing challenges faced by towns and cities and suggested that &quot;[t]he town centre serves not only social, utilitarian or hedonic shopping purposes but also supports out-of-hours entertainment and leisure services. The way that consumers perceive and use town centres has also fundamentally changed.&quot; In order to address the issues threatening the sustainability of towns it is increasingly important to consider Consumer behaviour and customer experience. This is in line with research that proposes that for high street retail to thrive in spite of the growth threat of eCommerce, the sensual hedonic experiences (e.g. scent, feel, etc.) need to be presented to visitors while allowing for discovery of hidden experiences in the built environment.

===Small shop preservationist movement===
In 2006, a House of Commons committee concluded that the loss of small shops on high streets in favor of chain stores contributes to the formation of clone towns, leading to &quot;a loss of sociability&quot;.

===The &quot;Portas Review&quot;===
In 2011, business consultant Mary Portas, best known for the TV series &quot;Mary Queen of Shops&quot;, was commissioned by the UK government to provide an independent review of High Street shopping. The report provided evidence for the decline of High Street precincts such as data indicating that retail spending in High Street shops had fallen to below 50 per cent. Her final report set out a vision for High Streets and a number of recommendations. However, her plan has failed to stem the number of High Street store closures, leaving authorities in a quandary about how to proceed.

== Comparative usage ==
The term &quot;High Street&quot; is used to describe stores found on a typical high street to differentiate them from more specialised, exclusive and expensive outlets (often independent stores) – for example, &quot;High Street banks&quot; (instead of the less-common private or investment banks) or &quot;High Street shops&quot; (instead of boutiques).

The phrase &quot;High Street banks&quot; is used to refer to the retail banking sector in the United Kingdom.

== International equivalents==
===Australia===
Alongside &quot;High Street&quot;, the term &quot;Main Street&quot; is also used in smaller towns and villages.

===Belgium and the Netherlands===

The Dutch equivalent is &quot;Hoogstraat&quot;, or in villages &quot;Dorpsstraat&quot; (&quot;village street&#x27;).

===Canada===
Alongside the term &quot;High Street&quot;, the terms &quot;Main Street&quot; or &quot;Central Avenue&quot; are also used. In Canada, east of Lake Superior, King Street and Queen Street are often major streets; &quot;rue Principale&quot;, as the literal French language equivalent of &quot;Main Street&quot; is frequently used in Quebec towns, and &quot;a village where the main street is still Main Street&quot; is a phrase that is used in respect for small towns. In some sections of Canada, the main commercial district is &quot;Front Street&quot; (especially in cities located alongside a waterway).

===Germany===
In Germany, the equivalent is &quot;Hauptstraße&quot; (Main Street), though this can also refer to a road with a lot of traffic (i.e., a highway). In most cities the main business and shopping area is rather referred to as &quot;Innenstadt&quot; (downtown) or by the specific street name. In Cologne the &quot;Hohe Straße&quot; (literally, High Street) is the main shopping street, but was named after a gate at its southern end (the &quot;Hohe Pforte&quot;, or High Gate).

===Ireland===


The term High Street is far less commonly used in Ireland. There, like in the United States, Main Street tends to be used instead. Neither of Dublin&#x27;s two main shopping streets (Grafton Street and Henry Street) carry this name, for example, nor does its main thoroughfare (O&#x27;Connell Street). While Dublin has street named High Street near Christchurch, formerly the centre of the medieval city, it is not a shopping street. The city of Cork&#x27;s main shopping street is St Patrick&#x27;s Street. The city&#x27;s oldest streets are named North Main Street and South Main Street. Limerick&#x27;s principal thoroughfare, like Dublin, is also O&#x27;Connell Street (the name is used in a number of other Irish towns in honour of Daniel O&#x27;Connell).

The term Main Street (, literally &quot;The Big/Great Street&quot;) is used across various types of settlements; from densely populated inner suburbs of Dublin such as Ranelagh, to satellite suburbs of the capital such as Swords, and also in villages and small towns throughout the country. For example, the OSI North Leinster Town Maps book lists sixteen &quot;Main Streets&quot; and only two &quot;High Streets&quot; in its thirty-town index of street names. Similarly, the OSI Dublin Street Guide (covering all of Dublin City and County Dublin) lists twenty &quot;Main Streets&quot; and only two &quot;High Streets&quot;. 

Some Irish towns do have a major shopping street named High Street (), including Killarney, Galway, Wexford, Ballinrobe, Westport, Bagenalstown, Macroom, Tuam, Wicklow, Trim, Monaghan, Kilkenny, and Kilrush. 

Bantry, County Cork is an interesting variant; the main shopping street is called High Street in its western part and Main Street in its eastern part. The same is found in Athlone and Birr, County Offaly.

===Jamaica===
In Jamaica, the main commercial district is &quot;Front Street&quot; (especially in cities located alongside a waterway). 

===Norway===
In Norway, the main commercial and administrative street is most often &#x27;Storgaten/Storgata&#x27; (Grand Street)

===Sweden===
In Sweden, the main street is often &#x27;Storgatan&#x27; (Grand Street), but as common is &#x27;Drottninggtan&#x27; (Queen&#x27;s street) and &#x27;Kungsgatan&#x27; (King&#x27;s Street)&#x27; 

===United States===
The equivalent in the United States is Main Street. In some sections of the United States, the main commercial district is &quot;Front Street&quot; (especially in cities located alongside a waterway).

<doc id="386411" wikidata="Q7488963" url="?curid=386411" title="Shannon Stewart (baseball)">
<text>Shannon Harold Stewart (born February 25, 1974) is an American former professional baseball outfielder with the Toronto Blue Jays, Minnesota Twins and Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball.

==Early life==
Stewart was born in Cincinnati and attended Miami Southridge High School in South Miami Heights, Florida. He played baseball and football and ran track at Miami Southridge. He was recruited by Bobby Bowden to play football at Florida State as a defensive back. He was named to the 1992 American Baseball Coaches Association/Rawlings High School All-America Second Team. His number would later be retired by the baseball team at Miami Southridge.

==Professional career==

===Toronto Blue Jays===
Stewart was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 19th pick of the 1992 MLB Draft as compensation for the Los Angeles Dodgers signing Tom Candiotti. He made his Major League debut on September 2, 1995 against the Chicago White Sox. Stewart fluctuated between the majors and minors over the next several seasons, eventually finding a place in the everyday Blue Jay lineup by the end of 1997.

In his first full season with the Blue Jays in 1998, he hit .279, belting 12 home runs and driving in 55 runs. During that season, he stole 51 bases, a career-high. Playing alongside superstars Jose Canseco, Roger Clemens, and Carlos Delgado that year, Stewart became a catalyst at the top of the Toronto lineup, providing speed and base-stealing ability, as well as some power and clutch-hitting. In every season from 1999 to 2002, Stewart batted .300 or higher and scored over 100 runs. He also showed some unexpected power, hitting a career-high 21 home runs in 2000.

Stewart spent parts of eight seasons with Toronto before he was dealt to the Minnesota Twins for Bobby Kielty in mid-2003. Stewart played in 855 games with Toronto, batting .301 with 218 doubles, 73 home runs and 163 stolen bases.

===Minnesota Twins===
Stewart was traded, along with the balance of his salary, on July 16, 2003, to the Minnesota Twins for Bobby Kielty. Following that off-season, the Blue Jays would trade Kielty for Ted Lilly. Stewart performed well for the Twins in the pennant race with the Chicago White Sox, batting .322 with six home runs and 38 RBI in 65 games with Minnesota, along with an on-base percentage of .384. The Twins won the American League Central Division title that year, but lost to the New York Yankees in four games in the American League Division Series. Despite his team&#x27;s loss, Stewart batted .400 with a .471 on-base percentage in that series. That year, Stewart finished fourth in American League MVP voting.

===Oakland Athletics===
On February 7, 2007, Stewart and the Oakland Athletics agreed to a one-year deal worth $1 million with a possible extra $1.5 million more in incentives based on playing time.

On June 7, 2007, Stewart broke up Curt Schilling&#x27;s bid for a no-hitter with a two out, bases-empty single in the bottom of the ninth inning.

Stewart finished his one season with the Athletics hitting .290 with 12 home runs and 48 RBI in 146 games.

===Toronto Blue Jays (second stint)===
The Toronto Blue Jays signed Stewart to a minor league deal on February 24, 2008, and gave their former first-round pick an invitation to spring training. Stewart ended up being chosen by the Jays to take over left field in a platoon with Matt Stairs, over fan favorite Reed Johnson who was released by the team. On March 30, the Blue Jays purchased Stewart&#x27;s contract from Triple-A Syracuse. He was released by the Blue Jays on August 11.

==Injuries==
After his stellar 2003 season, Stewart suffered from plantar fasciitis problems in both feet, limiting him to 92 games in 2004 and only 44 in 2006. While playing football in high school, Stewart suffered an injury to his shoulder, thus weakening his throwing ability. Because his arm is not as strong as it once was, he has sometimes been considered a liability in the field; opposing base runners frequently take bases they might not take if another fielder were playing his position.

==Accomplishments==
*Finished 4th in American League MVP voting (2003)
*3rd in the American League in steals (1998, 51 steals)
*4th in the American League in steals (1999, 37 steals)

==Career statistics==
In 1,386 games over 14 seasons, Stewart posted a .297 batting average (1653-for-5574) with 853 runs, 315 doubles, 41 triples, 115 home runs, 580 RBI, 196 stolen bases, 504 bases on balls, .360 on-base percentage and .430 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .984 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. In eight postseason games, he hit .286 (10-for-35) with 2 RBI.

<doc id="386413" wikidata="Q1789829" url="?curid=386413" title="Digital geometry">
<text>Digital geometry deals with discrete sets (usually discrete point sets) considered to be digitized models or images of objects of the 2D or 3D Euclidean space. 
Simply put, &quot;digitizing&quot; is replacing an object by a discrete set of its points. The images we see on the TV screen, the raster display of a computer, or in newspapers are in fact digital images.

Its main application areas are computer graphics and image analysis.

Main aspects of study are:
* Constructing digitized representations of objects, with the emphasis on precision and efficiency (either by means of synthesis, see, for example, Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm or digital disks, or by means of digitization and subsequent processing of digital images).
* Study of properties of digital sets; see, for example, Pick&#x27;s theorem, digital convexity, digital straightness, or digital planarity.
* Transforming digitized representations of objects, for example (A) into simplified shapes such as (i) skeletons, by repeated removal of simple points such that the digital topology of an image does not change, or (ii) medial axis, by calculating local maxima in a distance transform of the given digitized object representation, or (B) into modified shapes using mathematical morphology.
* Reconstructing &quot;real&quot; objects or their properties (area, length, curvature, volume, surface area, and so forth) from digital images.
* Study of digital curves, digital surfaces, and digital manifolds.
* Designing tracking algorithms for digital objects.
* Functions on digital space.
* Curve sketching, a method of drawing a curve pixel by pixel.
Digital geometry heavily overlaps with discrete geometry and may be considered as a part thereof.

==Digital space==
A 2D digital space usually means a 2D grid space that only contains integer points in 2D Euclidean space. A 2D image is a function on a 2D digital space (See image processing).

In Rosenfeld and Kak&#x27;s book, digital connectivity are defined as the relationship among elements in digital space. For example, 4-connectivity and 8-connectivity in 2D. Also see pixel connectivity. A digital space and its (digital-)connectivity determine a digital topology.

In digital space, the digitally continuous function (A. Rosenfeld, 1986) and the gradually varied function (L. Chen, 1989) were proposed, independently.

A digitally continuous function means a function in which the value (an integer) at a digital point is the same or off by at most 1 from its neighbors. In other words, if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are two adjacent points in a digital space, |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) − &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)| ≤ 1.

A gradually varied function is a function from a digital space formula_1 to formula_2 where formula_3 and formula_4 are real numbers. This function possesses the following property: If &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are two adjacent points in formula_1, assume formula_6, then formula_7, formula_8, or formula_9. So we can see that the gradually varied function is defined to be more general than the digitally continuous function.

An extension theorem related to above functions was mentioned by A. Rosenfeld (1986) and completed by L. Chen (1989). This theorem states: Let formula_10 and formula_11. The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the gradually varied extension formula_12 of formula_13 is : for each pair of points formula_14 and formula_15 in formula_16, assume formula_6 and formula_18, we have formula_19, where formula_20 is the (digital) distance between formula_14 and formula_15.

<doc id="386416" wikidata="Q335143" url="?curid=386416" title="Constantine Phipps, 2nd Baron Mulgrave">
<text>Constantine John Phipps, 2nd Baron Mulgrave (30 May 1744 – 10 October 1792) was an English explorer and officer in the Royal Navy. He served during the Seven Years&#x27; War and the American War of Independence, seeing action in a number of battles and engagements. Inheriting a title, he also went on to have a successful career in Parliament and occupied a number of political offices during his later years.

==Family and early life==
Phipps was born on 30 May 1744, the eldest son of Constantine Phipps, 1st Baron Mulgrave and his wife, Lepel Hervey, the eldest daughter of John 2nd Baron Hervey of Ickworth and Mary &#x27;Molly&#x27; Lepel. Phipps attended Eton College, where he befriended Joseph Banks, the English naturalist, botanist, and later patron of the natural sciences.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
In January 1759, he joined the 70-gun as a cadet under his uncle Captain Augustus Hervey during Hervey&#x27;s 21-week watch on the French fleet in 1759. Phipps remained with his uncle on the latter&#x27;s appointment to the 74-gun in 1761, and was present at the British expedition against Martinique. His good service led to his promotion to lieutenant on 17 March 1762 by Sir George Rodney, and Phipps went on to serve in the siege of Havana.

He was further promoted on 24 November 1763 to command the 12-gun sloop , moving to the 24-gun sixth rate &quot;Terpsichore&quot; on 20 June 1765. In 1766, he sailed to Newfoundland as lieutenant on under Captain Sir Thomas Adams. Joseph Banks accompanied him as ship&#x27;s naturalist. From 1767 to 1768, Phipps commanded in the English Channel.

==Political career and command==
Phipps was elected to Parliament in the 1768 general election as Member for the constituency of Lincoln. On 4 June 1773, Phipps set off from Deptford on a voyage towards the North Pole. He had two ships, the and the . Phipps took with him Dr Charles Irving as naturalist and doctor accompanied by Olaudah Equiano, and Israel Lyons (1739–1775) as astronomer. The &quot;Carcass&quot; was commanded by Skeffington Lutwidge, while one of her midshipmen was a young Horatio Nelson.

They sailed beyond Svalbard to the Seven Islands, but were forced back by the ice and returned to Orford Ness on 17 September. During the voyage, Phipps was the first modern European to describe the polar bear and the ivory gull, which were included in his &quot;A Voyage towards the North Pole undertaken ... 1773&quot; (1774).

On 13 September 1775, he succeeded his father as Baron Mulgrave in the Peerage of Ireland. He became MP for Huntingdon in 1777, and was also appointed as one of the Lords of the Admiralty. Continuing an active naval career, he commissioned the 74-gun in 1778, and played a leading role in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July that year. Phipps led the attack on the 90-gun , but the indecisive nature of the engagement meant that the French ship was able to escape.

Phipps returned to Britain and gave evidence at the subsequent court-martial, his evidence favouring Hugh Palliser. The &quot;Courageux&quot; remained under his command until 1781, with Phipps serving mostly in the Channel under Admirals Charles Hardy, Francis Geary, George Darby and Richard Howe.

In the action of 4 January 1781, he captured the 32-gun French frigate &quot;Minerve&quot; in heavy weather off Brest. The &quot;Courageux&quot; was paid off at the end of the American War of Independence, and Phipps went ashore, never to serve at sea again.

==Later life==
Phipps remained as MP for Huntingdon until 1784, when he became MP for Newark. In April that year, he became Paymaster of the Forces and on 18 May, he was appointed a commissioner for the affairs of India, and one of the Lords of Trade and Plantations, until being forced to resign in 1791 due to ill health.

In 1790, he was made Baron Mulgrave of Mulgrave in the County of York in the Peerage of Great Britain, thus entering the House of Lords. He also was a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries. He once entertained his miners underground in the Blue John Caverns in Castleton, Derbyshire. The particular cavern where they all dined as his guests is now named after him.

He died at Liège on 10 October 1792. The title of Baron Mulgrave in the British peerage then became extinct, though his brother Henry Phipps succeeded him in the Irish barony.

<text>Paul John Quantrill (born November 3, 1968) is a Canadian former professional baseball right-handed relief pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 14 seasons, from 1992 to 2005; his longest tenure was six seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays. Quantrill appeared in 80 or more games during a season five times, led his league in pitching appearances for four consecutive seasons, and did not walk more than 25 batters in a season from 1996 onwards.

==Career==
Quantrill was drafted in 1986 MLB draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 26th round, 660th overall, but did not sign. After three years at the University of Wisconsin he was drafted again, by the Boston Red Sox in the sixth round of the 1989 MLB draft, 161st overall, and made his major league debut on July 20, 1992.

Originally considered a starter, Quantrill eventually found consistency as a reliever after several years of splitting time between the bullpen and the starting rotation for several teams. Some of his best years came for the Toronto Blue Jays, a team located in his home province of Ontario. Quantrill earned a reputation for being very durable and having impeccable control; commentators often joked that he had a &quot;rubber arm&quot;.

Before the 2004 season, Quantrill signed a two-year, $6.8-million deal with the New York Yankees. Quantrill pitched effectively for the Yankees as a set-up man for most of the season, leading Yankees announcer Michael Kay to create the nickname “Quan-Gor-Mo” for the “three-headed monster” that made up the Yankees usual bullpen progression of Quantrill, Tom Gordon and Mariano Rivera (known as “Mo”).

Due to poor performance, arguably due to overuse by manager Joe Torre, in late 2004 and early 2005, Quantrill was designated for assignment on July 1, 2005. The next day he was traded to the San Diego Padres for pitchers Tim Redding and Darrell May. Quantrill was then traded to the Florida Marlins and spent the rest of the year in the bullpen. While playing in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, Quantrill announced that he would retire at the end of the event.

Quantrill served as a coach for Team Canada during the World Baseball Classics in 2009, 2013, and 2017.

On June 19, 2010, Quantrill was inducted, along with former Blue Jay Roberto Alomar, into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in St. Marys, Ontario.

==Accomplishments==
* All-Star (2001)
* 4× led his league in appearances (2001 AL, 2002 NL, 2003 NL, 2004 AL)
* Career 3.83 earned run average (ERA)
* Holds New York Yankees record for most games pitched in a season (86 in 2004)

==Personal life==
Since retirement, Quantrill has lived in Port Hope, Ontario.

Quantrill has a son and two daughters. His son, Cal, is a pitcher in Major League Baseball.

, Quantrill serves as a special assistant to the Toronto Blue Jays organization.

<text>This is a list of rivers that are at least partially in France. The rivers are grouped by sea or ocean. The rivers flowing into the sea are sorted along the coast. Rivers flowing into other rivers are listed by the rivers they flow into. Some rivers (e.g. Sûre/Sauer) do not flow through France themselves, but they are mentioned for having French tributaries. They are given in &quot;italics&quot;. For clarity, only rivers that are longer than 50 km (or have longer tributaries) are shown.

In French, rivers are traditionally classified either as &quot;fleuves&quot; when they flow into the sea (or into a desert or lake), or as &quot;rivières&quot; when they flow into another river. The &quot;fleuves&quot; are shown in bold.

For an alphabetical overview of rivers of France, see the category Rivers of France.

<doc id="386446" wikidata="Q728337" url="?curid=386446" title="Thomas Nuttall">
<text>Thomas Nuttall (5 January 1786 – 10 September 1859) was an English botanist and zoologist who lived and worked in America from 1808 until 1841.

Nuttall was born in the village of Long Preston, near Settle in the West Riding of Yorkshire and spent some years as an apprentice printer in England. Soon after going to the United States he met professor Benjamin Smith Barton in Philadelphia. Barton encouraged his strong interest in natural history.

==Early explorations in the United States==
In 1810 he travelled to the Great Lakes and in 1811 travelled on the Astor Expedition led by William Price Hunt on behalf of John Jacob Astor up the Missouri River. Nuttall was accompanied by the English botanist John Bradbury, who was collecting plants on behalf of Liverpool botanical gardens. Nuttall and Bradbury left the party at the trading post with the Arikara Indians in South Dakota, and continued farther upriver with Ramsay Crooks. In August they returned to the Arikara post and joined Manuel Lisa&#x27;s group on a return to St. Louis.

Although Lewis and Clark had travelled this way previously, many of their specimens had been lost. Therefore, many of the plants collected by Nuttall on this trip were unknown to science. The imminent war between Britain and America caused him to return to London via New Orleans. In London he spent time organising his large plant collection and discussing his experiences with other scientists.

==Return to the US after the War of 1812; activities and major works (1815-1841)==
In 1815, he returned to America and after spending some more time collecting published &quot;The Genera of North American Plants&quot; (1818). In 1817, Nuttall was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. From 1818 to 1820, he travelled along the Arkansas and Red Rivers, returning to Philadelphia and publishing his &quot;Journal of Travels Into the Arkansas Territory During the Year 1819&quot; (1821). He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1823. In 1825, he became curator of the botanical gardens at Harvard University. He published his &quot;Manual of the Ornithology of the United States and of Canada&quot; (1832 and 1834).

In 1834, he resigned his post and set off west again on an expedition led by Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth, this time accompanied by the naturalist John Kirk Townsend. They travelled through Kansas, Wyoming, and Utah, and then down the Snake River to the Columbia. Nuttall then sailed across the Pacific Ocean to the Hawaiian Islands in December. He returned in the spring of 1835 and spent the next year botanizing in the Pacific Northwest, an area already covered by David Douglas. On the Pacific coast, Nuttall heard of the ship &quot;Alert&quot; leaving San Diego in May 1836, bound for Boston. It is here that he encounters Richard Henry Dana Jr., a former student of his at Harvard who had set sail from Boston on a two-year voyage to the California coast at about the same time Nuttall had begun his expedition. Dana writes in his memoir, &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; (1840), of his amazement at seeing his old professor &quot;strolling about San Diego beach, in a sailor&#x27;s pea jacket, with a wide straw hat, and barefooted, with his trousers rolled up to his knees, picking up stones and shells.&quot; Nuttall was taken on the &quot;Alert&quot; as a passenger along with many of his flora and fauna specimens, which he brought back to Boston to be cataloged and preserved for posterity. Dana writes that though the professor spent much of the voyage in his cabin, he had some occasions to speak with Nuttall about his botanizing while Dana was at the helm of the ship &quot;on a calm night&quot; and was amused to hear his fellow shipmates refer to Nuttall as &quot;Old Curious&quot; for all the curiosities he conveyed on board. Once around the Horn, some of the sights on the trip through the South Atlantic prompted Nuttall to emerge from his quarters: upon sighting Isla de los Estados off the tip of Cape Horn, Nuttall told the Captain of the &quot;Alert&quot; that he would have liked to explore that place; and Nuttall also enjoyed the sight of dolphins swimming near the ship.

From 1836 until 1841, Nuttall worked at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. During this time he made contributions to the &quot;Flora of North America&quot; being prepared by Asa Gray and John Torrey. The death of his uncle then required Nuttall to return to England. By terms of his uncle&#x27;s will, to inherit the property, Nuttall had to remain in England for nine months of each year. His &quot;North American Sylva: Trees not described by F. A. Michaux&quot;, which was the first book to include all the trees of North America, was finished just before he left the US in December 1841.

==Later==
From 1842 until his death in 1859 Nuttall lived at Nutgrove Hall in St Helens, Lancashire, built by printer Jonas Nuttall in 1810. Nuttall is buried at Christ Church in the nearby village of Eccleston.

==Named after him==
The World Register of Marine Species lists 44 marine genera and species named after him with the epithet &quot;nuttalli&quot;. Various plants and birds were named after Nuttall, including Nuttall&#x27;s woodpecker &quot;Dryobates nuttallii&quot; by his friend William Gambel, and yellow-billed magpie &quot;Pica nuttalli&quot; and common poorwill &quot;Phalaenoptilus nuttallii&quot; by John James Audubon. He is also commemorated in the Pacific dogwood &quot;Cornus nuttallii&quot;, Nuttall&#x27;s larkspur &quot;Delphinium nuttallianum&quot;, Nuttall&#x27;s oak &quot;Quercus texana&quot;, the catclaw briar &quot;Mimosa nuttallii&quot;, Nuttall&#x27;s violet &quot;Viola nuttallii&quot;, Nuttall&#x27;s saltbush &quot;Atriplex nuttallii&quot;, Nuttall&#x27;s rayless goldenrod &quot;Bigelowia nuttallii&quot;, and other plants.

The Nuttall Ornithological Club of Cambridge, Massachusetts, is named after him.

<text>Sir Arthur Helps (10 July 1813 – 7 March 1875) was an English writer and dean of the Privy Council. He was a Cambridge Apostle and an early advocate of animal rights.

==Biography==
The youngest son of London merchant Thomas Helps, Arthur Helps was born in Streatham in South London.

He was educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge, coming out thirty-first wrangler in the mathematical tripos in 1835. He was recognized by the ablest of his contemporaries there as a man of superior gifts, and likely to make his mark in later life. As a member of the &quot;Conversazione Society&quot;, better known as the Cambridge Apostles, a society established in 1820 for the purposes of discussion on social and literary questions by a few young men attracted to each other by a common taste for literature and speculation, he was associated with Charles Buller, Frederick Maurice, Richard Chenevix Trench, Monckton Milnes, Arthur Hallam and Alfred Tennyson.

Soon after leaving the university, Arthur Helps became private secretary to Thomas Spring Rice (afterwards Lord Monteagle), then Chancellor of the Exchequer. This appointment he filled until 1839, when he went to Ireland as private secretary to Lord Morpeth (afterwards Earl of Carlisle), Chief Secretary for Ireland. In the meanwhile (28 October 1836) Helps had married Bessy Fuller, daughter of Captain Edward Fuller and Elizabeth Blennerhassett. Bessy&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Rev. John Blennerhassett of Tralee, County Kerry, was the cousin of Harman Blennerhassett.

He was one of the commissioners for the settlement of various claims relating to the Gunboat War dating as far back as 1807. In retaliation for the bombardment of Copenhagen, the Danish government had impounded British goods in warehouses, and merchant ships with their cargoes. Although the seizure of goods on land had been settled soon afterwards, the ship-owners were still fruitlessly pursuing their claims for compensation from the British Government as late as 1861. However, with the fall of the Melbourne administration (1841) Helps&#x27; official experience closed for a period of nearly twenty years. He bought the Vernon Hill estate near Bishops Waltham, Hampshire, and a private income allowed him to turn to writing books and plays, which he dictated to an amanuensis.

He was not, however, forgotten by his political friends. He possessed admirable tact and sagacity; his fitness for official life was unmistakable, and in 1860 he was appointed Clerk of the Privy Council on the recommendation of Lord Granville. This appointment brought him into personal communication with The Queen and The Prince Consort, both of whom came to regard him with confidence and respect. In 1864 he received the honorary degree of DCL from Oxford University.

In 1862 he established the Bishops Waltham Clay Company for the manufacture of bricks and terracotta. He was also involved with the Bishops Waltham Railway Company, set up to link the brickworks (and the town) with the main London-Southampton line. However, profits were small and he faced competition from the Staffordshire Potteries. Helps also financed the Coke and Gasworks which lit the town from 1864.

Helps was also affected by the banking panic of 1866, caused by the failure of Overend, Gurney and Company. It had invested heavily in long-term railway stocks rather than holding cash reserves. The brickworks went into liquidation in 1867 and Helps had to sell the Vernon Hill estate. Queen Victoria in a personal gesture (he had edited a volume of Prince Albert&#x27;s speeches in 1862) offered him a grace and favour residence in Kew Gardens. He lived for the rest of his life in Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Cottage, near the main gates.

He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1871 and a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the following year. He died of pleurisy on 7 March 1875.

==Animal rights==
Helps was an early advocate of animal rights and was concerned about animal cruelty. He authored &quot;Some Talk About Animals and Their Masters&quot; in 1873. The book is notable for extending rights even to insects. Edward Nicholson dedicated his book &quot;Rights of an Animal&quot; (1879) to Helps.

==Writings==
His first literary effort, &quot;Thoughts in the Cloister and the Crowd&quot; (1835), was a series of aphorisms upon life, character, politics and manners. One of these aphorisms is quoted by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty, Chapter Two: &quot;The Deep slumber of decided opinion.&quot;

His &quot;Essays written in the Intervals of Business&quot; had appeared in 1841, and his &quot;Claims of Labour, an Essay on the Duties of the Employers to the Employed&quot;, in 1844. Two plays, &quot;King Henry the Second, an Historical Drama&quot;, and &quot;Catherine Douglas, a Tragedy&quot;, published in 1843, have no particular merit. Neither in these nor in his only other dramatic effort, &quot;Oulita the Serf&quot; (1858) did he show any real qualifications as a playwright.

Helps possessed, however, enough dramatic power to give life and individuality to the dialogues with which he enlivened many of his other books. In his &quot;Friends in Council, a Series of Readings and Discourse thereon&quot; (1847-1859), Helps varied his presentment of social and moral problems by dialogues between imaginary personages, who, under the names of Milverton, Ellesmere and Dunsford, grew to be almost as real to Helps&#x27;s readers as they certainly became to himself. The book was very popular, and the same expedient was resorted to in &quot;Conversations on War and General Culture&quot;, published in 1871. The familiar speakers, with others added, also appeared in his &quot;Realmah&quot; (1868) and in the best of its author&#x27;s later works, &quot;Talk About Animals and Their Masters&quot; (1873).

A long essay on slavery in the first series of &quot;Friends in Council&quot; was subsequently elaborated into a work in two volumes published in 1848 and 1852, called &quot;The Conquerors of the New World and their Bondsmen&quot;. Helps went to Spain in 1847 to examine the numerous manuscripts bearing upon his subject at Madrid. The fruits of these researches were embodied in a historical work based upon his &quot;Conquerors of the New World&quot;, called &quot;The Spanish Conquest in America, and its Relation to the History of Slavery and the Government of Colonies&quot; (4 vols, 1855, 1857-1861). But in spite of his scrupulous efforts after accuracy, the success of the book was marred by its obtrusively moral purpose and its discursive character.

&quot;The Life of Las Casas, the Apostle of the Indians&quot; (1868), &quot;The Life of Columbus&quot; (1869), &quot;The Life of Pizarro&quot; (1869), and &quot;The Life of Hernando Cortrés&quot; (1871), when extracted from the work and published separately, proved successful. Besides the books which have been already mentioned he wrote: &quot;Organization in Daily Life, an Essay&quot; (1862), &quot;Casimir Maremma&quot; (1870), &quot;Brevia, Short Essays and Aphorisms&quot; (1871), &quot;Thoughts upon Government&quot; (1872), &quot;Life and Labors of Mr Thomas Brassey&quot; (1872), &quot;Iras de Biron&quot; (1874), &quot;Social Pressure&quot; (1875).

After the death of Prince Albert, Queen Victoria turned to Helps to prepare an appreciation of her husband&#x27;s life and character. In his introduction to the collection (1862) of the Prince Consort&#x27;s speeches and addresses Helps adequately fulfilled his task. Some years afterwards he edited and wrote a preface to the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Leaves from a Journal of our Life in the Highlands&quot; (1868).

<text>John Torrey (August 15, 1796 – March 10, 1873) was an American botanist, chemist, and physician. Throughout much of his career, he was a teacher of chemistry, often at multiple universities, while he also pursued botanical work, focusing on the flora of North America. His most renowned works include studies of the New York flora, the Mexican Boundary, the Pacific railroad surveys, and the uncompleted &quot;Flora of North America&quot;.

==Biography==
Torrey was born in New York City in 1796, the second child of Capt. William and Margaret (née Nichols) Torrey. He showed a fondness for mechanics, and at one time planned to become a machinist. When he was 15 or 16, his father received an appointment to the state prison at Greenwich Village, New York, where he was tutored by Amos Eaton, then a prisoner and later a pioneer of natural history studies in America. He thus learned the elements of botany and something of mineralogy and chemistry. In 1815 he began studying medicine with Wright Post, and qualified in 1818. He opened a medical practice in New York City, while devoting his leisure to botany and other scientific pursuits.

In 1817, he became one of the founders of the New York Lyceum of Natural History (now the New York Academy of Science), and one of his first contributions to this body was his &quot;Catalogue of Plants growing spontaneously within Thirty Miles of the City of New York&quot; (Albany, 1819). Its publication gained for him the recognition of foreign and native botanists. In 1824 he issued the only volume of his &quot;Flora of the Northern and Middle States&quot;. This used John Lindley&#x27;s system of classifying flora, a way of classifying that was not commonly used in the United States.

He found the medical profession uncongenial, and on August 5, 1824, he entered the United States Army as an assistant surgeon and became acting professor of chemistry and geology at West Point military academy. Three years later, he became professor of chemistry and botany in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York (the medical school of Columbia University), where he stayed until 1855, when he was made professor emeritus. He was also professor of chemistry at Princeton 1830–1854, and of chemistry, mineralogy, and botany at the University of the City of New York 1832/3. He resigned from his Army position on August 31, 1828. In 1835, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.

In 1836 he was appointed botanist to the state of New York and produced his &quot;Flora&quot; of that state in 1843; while from 1838 to 1843 he carried on the publication of the earlier portions of &quot;Flora of North America&quot;, with the assistance of his pupil, Asa Gray. From 1853 he was chief assayer to the United States assay office in New York City when that office was established, but he continued to take an interest in botanical teaching until his death. He was frequently consulted by the treasury department on matters pertaining to the coinage and currency, and was sent on special missions at various times to visit the different mints. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1856.

In 1856, Torrey was chosen a trustee of Columbia College, and in 1860, having presented the college with his herbarium, numbering about 50,000 specimens, he was made emeritus professor of chemistry and botany. On the consolidation of the College of Physicians and Surgeons with Columbia in 1860, he was chosen one of its trustees. His advice was frequently sought on scientific subjects by various corporations.

He was the first president of the Torrey Botanical Club in 1873.
Besides being the last surviving charter member of the Lyceum of Natural History, he held its vice presidency for several years, and was president in 1824–26 and 1838, holding the same office in the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1855, and he was one of the original members of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States, being named as such by act of the United States Congress in 1863. The degree of A.M. was conferred on him by Yale in 1823, and that of LL.D. by Amherst in 1845.

Torrey died at his home in New York City on March 10, 1873; he was buried in the family plot at Long Hill Cemetery, Stirling, New Jersey.

===Private life===
Torrey married Eliza Shaw on April 20, 1824; they had three daughters and a son, Herbert, who became United States Assayer.

==Publications==
Torrey&#x27;s earliest publications in the &quot;American Journal of Science&quot; are on mineralogy. In 1820, he undertook the examination of the plants that had been collected around the headwaters of the Mississippi by David B. Douglass. During the same year, he received the collections made by Edwin James while with the expedition that was sent out to the Rocky Mountains under Major Stephen H. Long. His report was the earliest treatise of its kind in the United States that was arranged on the natural system. Torrey, in the meantime, had planned &quot;A Flora of the Northern and Middle United States, or a Systematic Arrangement and Description of all the Plants heretofore discovered in the United States North of Virginia&quot;, and in 1824 began its publication in parts, but it was soon suspended owing to the general adoption of the natural system of Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in place of that of Carl Linnaeus. In 1836, on the organization of the geological survey of New York, he was appointed botanist, and required to prepare a flora of the state. His report, consisting of two quarto volumes, was issued in 1843, and was for a long time the most comprehensive for any state in the United States. In 1838, he began with Asa Gray &quot;The Flora of North America&quot;, which was issued in numbers irregularly until 1843, when they had completed the &quot;Compositae&quot;, but new botanical material accumulated at such a rapid rate that it was deemed best to discontinue it.

Subsequently, Torrey published reports on the plants that were collected by John C. Frémont in the expedition to the Rocky Mountains (1845), those gathered by Major William H. Emory on his reconnaissance from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to San Diego, California (1848), the specimens secured by Captain Howard Stansbury on his expedition to the Great Salt Lake of Utah (1852), the plants collected by John C. Frémont in California (1853), those brought back from the Red River of Louisiana by Captain Randolph B. Marcy (1853), and the botany of Captain Lorenzo Sitgreaves&#x27;s expedition to the Zuni and Colorado Rivers (1854), also memoirs on the botany of the various expeditions for the purpose of determining the most practicable route for a Pacific Railroad (1855–1860).

He reported on the &quot;Botany of the Mexican Boundary Survey&quot; (1859), that of the expedition upon the Colorado River under Lieutenant Joseph C. Ives (1861), and, in association with Asa Gray, the botanical collections of the Wilkes exploring expedition. The last was in his hands at the time of his death, its publication having been delayed by the Civil War.

His bibliography is extensive, including contributions on botanical subjects to scientific periodicals and to the transactions of the societies of which he was a member.

==Plant taxa named by Torrey==

==Legacy==

Torrey&#x27;s name is commemorated in the small coniferous genus &quot;Torreya&quot;, found in North America, China and Japan. Some species within this genus include:
* &quot;T. taxifolia&quot;, a native of Florida, is known as the Florida torreya or stinking-cedar.
* &quot;T. californica&quot;, also known as California nutmeg or California torreya (although not closely related to true nutmeg). 
* &quot;T. nucifera&quot;, a coniferous tree native to southern Japan and to South Korea&#x27;s Jeju Island
* &quot;T. grandis&quot;, a conifer endemic to eastern and south-eastern China.

&quot;P. torreyana&quot; an endangered species from southern California, is also named after the botanist. Torrey first described the carnivorous plant &quot;Darlingtonia californica&quot;, which he named after his friend Dr. William Darlington. Torrey Canyon in Ventura County, California, was named for him, as was Torreys Peak in Colorado, near Grays Peak, named after his pupil and friend Asa Gray.

A bronze bas-relief portrait of Torrey is mounted in the main building of the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, a former site of Dr. Torrey&#x27;s summer home. A similar portrait is owned by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. In 2017, the Torrey Botanical Society, started by colleagues of John Torrey, celebrated its 150th birthday. It is the oldest botanical society in the Americas.

Torreys Peak, a fourteen thousand foot mountain in Colorado, was named for Torrey.

<text>Vladimir Voronin (; born Vladimir Bujeniță, 25 May 1941) is a Moldovan politician. He was the third President of Moldova from 2001 until 2009 and has been the leader of the Party of Communists of Moldova (PCRM) since 1994. He was Europe&#x27;s first democratically elected communist party head of state after the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc.

== Family and education ==
Vladimir Voronin was born as Vladimir Bujeniță in the village of Corjova, located that time in the newly-established Moldavian SSR. Although Voronin is a lifelong communist who pursued unfriendly policies towards Romania at various times during the 2000s, his grandfather Isidor Sârbu was an anticommunist fighter in Romania after 1944. Voronin&#x27;s mother, Pelagheia Bujeniță, died on 2 July 2005. His biological father, Nicolae Bujeniță, died during World War II. Voronin was raised by his step-father, Nikolai Voronin, an ethnic Russian and a communist activist.

Voronin graduated from the Cooperation Tekhnikum (&quot;Kooperativny tekhnikum&quot;) of Chișinău (1961), the All-Union Institute for Food Industry (1971), the Academy of Social Sciences of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1983), and the Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union (1991). Voronin&#x27;s CV states he is an economist, engineer, political science graduate, and jurist by education.

==Early career==
He began working in 1961 as the head of a bakery in the town of Criuleni. From 1966 until 1971, Voronin held the offices of vice-director of the bread factory in Criuleni and head of the bread factory in Dubăsari.

After 1971, he was active in the state administration of the Moldavian SSR, being in turn a member of the Dubăsari and Ungheni township executive committees, of the Ungheni District Executive Committee, and, starting 1983, inspector and vice-director of the Organization Section of the Central Committee of the Moldavian branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1985, he was appointed head of section in the Council of Ministers of the Moldavian SSR. Between 1985 and 1989, Voronin served as first secretary of the Bender City Committee of the Communist Party. Between 1988 and 1990, he held the office of the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Moldovan SSR. In this capacity he advocated against the use of force to quell anti-Soviet popular demonstrations on 7 and 10 November 1989, a regretful reference to which he made when addressing the country on TV on 8 April 2009 after anti-government protests were quelled by the police. Voronin was also a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian SSR of 10th and 11th legislatures.

In 1993, Voronin became the co-president of the Organizational Committee for the creation of the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM). He played a central role in reviving the Communist Party after it was banned in 1991–1993. In 1994 he was elected President of the PCRM. He was a candidate for the post of President of the now-independent Republic of Moldova at the 1996 elections. In the parliamentary election in March 1998, Vladimir Voronin was elected as a Member of Parliament. He then served as member of its Permanent Bureau and as president of the PCRM&#x27;s parliamentary faction, which held 40 of 101 seats.

Voronin was nominated as Prime Minister of Moldova by President Petru Lucinschi in late 1999, but the nomination was unsuccessful because Voronin did not have enough support in parliament. In the parliamentary election in February 2001, he was again elected as a Member of Parliament.

==Presidential career==
===First mandate===

The PCRM won 50.07% of the vote and 71 of the 101 seats in the February 2001 parliamentary election; by this time the constitution had been changed to provide for election of the President through the Parliament rather than popular vote. In March the PCRM&#x27;s Central Committee nominated Voronin as its presidential candidate at a plenum, and on 4 April 2001 Voronin was elected as President by the Parliament. Of the 89 deputies participating in the vote, 71 voted for Voronin, 15 voted for Dumitru Braghiş, and three voted for Valerian Cristea. He was sworn in at a ceremony in Chişinău on 7 April 2001. The Constitutional Court ruled that the President could also lead a political party, and Voronin was re-elected as the PCRM&#x27;s leader.

Voronin maintained his commitment to the reduction of Moldova&#x27;s chronic poverty by allocating more resources to social safety net items such as health, education, and increasing pensions and salaries. These measures helped to maintain support for his government, but Moldova still remained the poorest country in Europe throughout his presidency, with around 38% of GDP coming from remittances of Moldovans working abroad (2008). Voronin&#x27;s tenure as President was marked by fluctuating relations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.

From January to April 2002, opposition forces organized large demonstrations in protest against several controversial government proposals, including expanded use of the Russian language in schools, and plans for its designation as a second official language. While the demonstrations were tense at times, the government did not use force and ultimately agreed to mediation by the Council of Europe.

In 2003, Voronin&#x27;s government backtracked over signing a Russian-proposed federalization settlement with the breakaway region of Transnistria (Kozak memorandum). On the same year, Voronin claimed that &quot;Romania has remained the only empire in Europe, consisting of Moldavia, Dobruja and Transylvania&quot;, provoking a diplomatic conflict with Romania and the President of Romania Ion Iliescu. In 2004, Voronin branded the leadership of Transnistria &quot;a transnational criminal group&quot;, and ordered an economic blockade of Transnistria after its authorities closed several Romanian-speaking schools.

=== Second mandate ===

In the parliamentary election in March 2005, the PCRM received 46.1% of the vote and won 56 seats in the 101-member Parliament — more than enough for the 51-vote minimum required to remain in government, but short of the 61 votes necessary to elect a president. However, President Voronin received the necessary support from the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party, the Democratic and Social Liberal factions, after he promised to deliver on needed reforms and Euro-Atlantic integration for the country. (The latter two factions broke away from the Electoral Bloc &quot;Moldova Democrată&quot; following the election, leaving the &quot;Our Moldova&quot; Alliance (AMN) of the former Mayor of Chişinău Serafim Urechean as the second-largest party in Parliament, with 26 seats.) In the presidential election held in Parliament on 4 April 2005, Voronin was re-elected with 75 votes; another candidate, Gheorghe Duca, received one vote, and two votes were invalid.

====Political agenda during tenure====

The declared main goals of his political agenda were:
* Closer ties with the Russian Federation and &quot;integration in Europe&quot;; solving the Transnistria conflict; EU cooperation (and membership if possible); strong opposition to NATO membership; independence, as opposed to a unification with Romania.

===Events of 2009 and resignation===
After the parliamentary election held on 5 April 2009, the PCRM won 49.48% of the vote and 60 seats, one seat too few to elect a President. Voronin was elected Speaker of the Parliament and retained the Presidency of Moldova with an interim status. The police crackdown of the civil unrest in April 2009 antagonized the society, and the communists were unable to secure one additional vote out of the 41 MPs from the three opposition parties; a snap parliamentary election was necessary.

In the snap parliamentary election in July 2009, the PCRM won 44.69% of the vote, which is more votes than any other individual party, and gained 48 seats, but it lost its parliamentary majority to a coalition of opposition parties which has 53 seats. However, the opposition also failed to obtain enough seats to elect a President, thereby producing more uncertainty. Voronin announced on 2 September 2009 that he intended to resign, saying that his position as acting President had become &quot;ambiguous and doubtful&quot;. He resigned on 11 September 2009. The President sent a letter to Parliament confirming his intention to resign. Mihai Ghimpu succeeded Voronin as acting president until a proper President could be elected.

== Post-presidential years ==
The pro-Western parliamentary majority on 29 December 2009 blocked Voronin&#x27;s election to Moldova&#x27;s permanent delegation at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. In February 2010, Vladimir Voronin and his wife returned the diplomatic passports which they were keeping illegally.

According to the last opinion polls carried out in 2019 regarding the most popular politicians of the Republic of Moldova, Vladimir Voronin is ranked on the seventh position among the top of politicians which enjoyed the highest trust of Moldovans&lt;ref name=&quot;Ziarulnational.md/sondaj-cate-mandate-de-deputat-ar-obtine-psrm-acum-si-pd-in-cricumscriptia-nationala-partidul-sor-la-limita/_2019-02-13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and according to some other polls he is ranked at the eighth position.

In 2023, he criticized the authorities, saying that a fascist dictatorship has been established in the country, depriving people of the right to free expression, the right to freedom of speech, the right to convey their position in their native language. Vladimir Voronin spoke about the closure in the last two years of 12 TV channels, dozens of information portals and periodicals, which - strictly within the law and constitutional rights - periodically criticized the authorities.

===Political views===
Though Voronin identifies himself as a left-wing politician, he is strongly conservative on social issues. He is against immigration and he rejects the building of mosques in Moldova, as well as LGBT rights. His remarks towards the African-born activist John Onoje (&quot;They [the ruling parties] brought here a Negro, who&#x27;d just climbed down from a tree, and now he&#x27;s doing politics for them.&quot;) are still regarded as controversial.

Despite the fact that his grandfather Isidor Sârbu emigrated to Romania, Voronin considers Moldovans and Romanians two different ethnic groups. Some of his declarations were considered anti-Romanian.

== Relations with Russia ==
In 2001, Moldovan Communist Vladimir Voronin had a clearly pro-Russian stance, opposing “pro-European” forces and pro-Romanian Unionists. Active Russian support helped Voronin to get convertible into votes the sympathy of the Russian-speaking population of Moldova, labor migrants in Russia and their families, residents of the Gagauz autonomy and Transnistrians, not to mention the most active part of the Moldovan electorate - pensioners. However, after one of these victories, the Moldovan leader launched the process of European integration, forgot about the promises made during the electoral struggle about the status of the Russian language and about constructive negotiations on Transnistria, after which his relations with the Russian Federation noticeably deteriorated.

In 2009, Vladimir Voronin paid a private visit to the dacha of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Completing his second and last (according to the Moldovan constitution) presidential term, Voronin hoped to take the important Moldovan position of Speaker of Parliament, for which his faction needed at least four additional votes. The purpose of Voronin&#x27;s visit was probably to persuade the Russian government to persuade some Moldovan party leaders to support the Communist faction in order to prevent oppositionists who support Moldova&#x27;s European integration from taking power.

In 2013, on the occasion of his party&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Communist leader Vladimir Voronin lamented the collapse of the Soviet Union and advocated for Moldova&#x27;s integration into the Russia-dominated Customs Union. Voronin criticized the then Moldovan leaders, accusing them of being corrupt, refusing to reintegrate Transnistria, and subordinating themselves to international financial institutions that allegedly do not act in the interests of the Moldovan people.

Voronin led the Communist Party of Moldova for more than twenty years. In 2015, in an interview for the special project “Russia and I. In the Shadow of the Kremlin,” he said that as president he rejected Russia&#x27;s plan to grant broad powers to separatist Transnistria. Since then, he admits, relations with Moscow have “cooled considerably.” 
He viewed relations with Russia through the prism of strategic partnership and active integration process within the CIS.

== The Voronin family and corruption ==
From 1999 to 2006, firms controlled by the Voronin family received free or for nothing 4 hectares of land in the most expensive zone of the city - opposite the park. According to cadastral documents, the elite real estate built there belongs to the members of the ex-president&#x27;s family: his son Oleg Voronin, grandson Aleksei Voronin, daughter Valentina Rusu and companies related to them. 

The family of Vladimir Voronin enjoys a strong reputation as the richest family in Moldova. Despite numerous accusations from both political parties and a number of media outlets, law enforcement agencies said they had found no confirmation of such information.

In 2009, according to a poll conducted by the website vedomosti.md, Vladimir Voronin became the leader of the rating of corruptors, gaining 45.25% of the voters.

In 2010, the son of the former president was checked for involvement in money laundering and tax evasion. The Center for Combating Economic Crimes and Corruption is investigating the relevant criminal cases. The offices of companies owned by Oleg Voronin were searched. At the same time, officially, as reported, he is neither a suspect nor an accused. The investigation was preceded by the appearance in the media of printouts of transactions from a bank card allegedly belonging to Vladimir Voronin&#x27;s son. According to this data, the owner of the card in 2008-2009 spent about five million dollars on shopping in expensive stores and staying in luxury hotels. At the same time, the income declaration of Voronin Jr. reportedly showed a much smaller amount. He himself denied the rumors about his super-income. Moldovan media have long written that the Voronin family&#x27;s business is estimated at €2 billion. After two years, the investigation of the case was closed due to lack of corpus delicti.

Vladimir Voronin is considered one of the richest people in Moldova. His income is estimated at about 700 million USD, there are data on his real estate in California (USA), Greece and Baden-Baden (Germany), also on a private sanatorium in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic), a collection of new cars, ownership of valuable plots of land in Moldova.

The leader of the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova started actively buying real estate abroad around 2002. Among the purchases are hotels, stores, mansions, villas and land plots in Austria for more than 200 million euros; a mansion in an elite district of Munich (Germany) for 7.5 million euros and a Falcon-900 airplane for 35 million euros. According to media reports, the plane was on standby to fly Voronin&#x27;s family out in case of danger. A considerable amount of money was also allocated from the state budget for the president&#x27;s flights: for eight years it amounted to approximately 27 million lei. It is known that in 2007-2008 the Ministry of Finance transferred an average of 5 million lei to the accounts of the airline “Nobil Air”, which transported Voronin and which is linked to the Moldovan oligarch Plahotniuc. Vladimir Voronin is known for his collection of cars. Timpul journalists write about an entire garage of luxury and retro cars in the basement of the new PCRM office on the capital&#x27;s Armenească Street. Voronin&#x27;s collection is estimated at more than 10 million lei in Moldova alone. There are also statements about cars in Germany. And also that the Voronin family has a mansion between French Strasbourg and German Baden-Baden. The PCRM chairman&#x27;s son, Oleg Voronin, owns a Maybach worth 500 thousand euros, two Mercedes-600s worth 120 thousand euros each, Mercedes and Hummer jeeps worth 100 thousand dollars each.

In 2019, Vladimir Voronin&#x27;s family was again in the epicenter of scandal. The National Bank of Moldova caught Oleg Voronin&#x27;s group shareholders in collusion and obliged them to sell their shares. According to the NBM, a group of Fincombank&#x27;s shareholders consensually bought a significant share of the bank&#x27;s shares - 36.15% without prior authorization of the National Bank. Thus, the shareholders violated the law “On banks&#x27; activity” and, according to the NBM decision, had to sell their shares. The largest shareholder was Oleg, who together with his family members, including the wife of ex-president Vladimir Voronin, owned 23.54% of shares. According to the National Bank, the company Avicomagro acted in collusion with Voronin&#x27;s family. Oleg Voronin lost his shares in Fincombank. The National Commission for Financial Market has decided to exclude from the State Register of Securities 475478 common registered shares of Fincombank, most of which belonged to Oleg Voronin&#x27;s family.

== Accusations of racism ==
On February 18, 2012, Vladimir Voronin publicly insulted a Moldovan political activist of Sudanese origin, John Onoje, pointing to his skin color. Amnesty International called on the prosecutor&#x27;s office and Moldovan MPs to investigate the incident and punish Voronin.

In 2021, the leader of the Party of Communists, Vladimir Voronin, was reported to the Council for the Prevention and Elimination of Discrimination and Equality. Vlad Bilețchi, leader of the Alliance for the Unification of Romanians (Alianța pentru Unirea Românilor - AUR) party, demanded that Voronin&#x27;s words that “with the arrival of NATO” ‘brown children’ will be born in Moldova” be recognized as xenophobic and racist.

==Personal life==
Vladimir Voronin is married to Taisia Mihailovna Voronina (a Ukrainian) and has two children, a son Oleg and a daughter Valentina. She works as a kindergarten manager, They were married on 12 October 1962, while he was still working in Criuleni. He has the military rank of Major General from the former USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs (equivalent of NATO OF-6 Brigadier General – &quot;see Ranks and insignia of the Soviet military and Ranks and insignia of NATO&quot;). Some argue that he also holds Russian citizenship in addition to citizenship of the Republic of Moldova, because he used to receive a pension as a former Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs employee, from the time he lived as a private citizen in Moscow in 1991–1993. His son, Oleg Voronin, is arguably the richest businessman in Moldova. His daughter is a physician, but unlike Oleg not a public figure. On 19 February 2010, Voronin told journalists that the questioning of his son is an attempt of revenge against his family by the current authorities. Oleg is suspected of fiscal evasion and money laundering.

<text>William Christopher Koch (born December 14, 1974) is an American former Major League Baseball relief pitcher. He was born in Rockville Centre, New York and went to West Babylon High School.

He debuted in the majors with the Toronto Blue Jays and last pitched in MLB with the Florida Marlins in 2004.

== Baseball career ==
Koch played college baseball for Clemson University from 1994 to 1996. He was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the first round (fourth pick) of the 1996 amateur draft and made his debut in 1999. He made an instant impression by regularly hitting 100 MPH with his fastball.

Koch won a bronze medal with the United States national baseball team at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

He was groomed for the role of closer, and had mixed success at the role over the next three seasons. While he was regarded as one of the most dominating pitchers in the league when he was at his best, at times he battled with his control and composure on the mound. Nevertheless, he continued to post improving save numbers (31, 33 and 36) from 1999 to 2001.

On December 7, 2001, the Blue Jays, now under new management, traded Koch to the Oakland Athletics for Eric Hinske and Justin Miller. The trade ended up working out for both teams, as Eric Hinske statistically outperformed Koch in his first season with the Jays while Oakland proved to be a good fit for closer Koch. He saved 44 games in 2002 while posting a 3.27 ERA and 93 strikeouts in 93 innings as well as earning 11 wins, becoming the first pitcher in major league history to earn 10 wins and 40 saves in one season. He won the Rolaids Relief Man Award based on his statistical performance that year. Koch, however, gave up a critical ninth-inning home run to Minnesota&#x27;s A. J. Pierzynski in the deciding game of the A&#x27;s first-round playoff series. That outing would turn out to be the turning point in Koch&#x27;s career.

On December 3, 2002, he was once again traded, this time to the Chicago White Sox along with two minor leaguers for Keith Foulke, Mark Johnson, Joe Valentine and cash, but was unable to replicate the successes he had experienced with Toronto or Oakland. Due to wild inconsistency on the mound, Jerry Manuel removed Koch from the role of closer, relegating him to middle relief. Koch finished the season with a disappointing 11 saves and a high 5.77 ERA.

His troubles continued in 2004. He was once again tried in the role of closer, but saved only 8 games in 24 games played, compiling an ERA of 5.40. He was traded to the Florida Marlins in June for Wilson Valdez, a minor-league second baseman who it was assumed would replace Luis Castillo before the latter signed a four-year contract to remain with Florida. Koch fared better in Florida than he did in Chicago, with a 1–2 record and a 3.51 ERA in 23 games as a setup man for Armando Benítez.

Following the 2004 season he was signed to a 1-year contract by his original team, the Toronto Blue Jays, though the team released him during spring training and an angry Koch announced he would not attempt to sign with another team, so that the Blue Jays would be on the hook for &#x27;every penny&#x27; of his $950,000 salary. He has not played baseball professionally since then.

Koch was featured in the film &quot;Moneyball&quot; in 2011 as the A&#x27;s primary closer for their record breaking 20 game winning streak.

<doc id="386455" wikidata="Q167724" url="?curid=386455" title="Guido de Marco">
<text>Guido de Marco (22 July 1931 – 12 August 2010) was a Maltese politician, who served as the sixth president of Malta from 1999 to 2004. A noted statesman and lawmaker, de Marco also served as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Interior, Justice, and Minister for Foreign Affairs.

He was elected President of the 45th session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1990, and Chairman of the Commonwealth Foundation in 2004. A renowned criminal lawyer, he defended some of the landmark cases in Malta during the 1980s. His sudden death in 2010 shocked the nation and prompted three days of national mourning and a state funeral.

==Early life and family==
Guido de Marco was born in Valletta to Emanuele and Giovanna (née Raniolo) de Marco. He was educated at St. Joseph High School, St. Aloysius&#x27; College and the University of Malta. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy, Economics and Italian in 1952, becoming a Doctor of Laws in 1955.

De Marco and his future wife, Violet Saliba, met as students. He proposed to her on February 5, 1951, as he walked her home from Valletta to Pietà. De Marco and Violet Saliba married in 1956; the couple had three children: Giannella, Fiorella and Mario. Mario, who served as parliamentary secretary for tourism at the time of his father&#x27;s death, said he was a family man who devoted time to his children and grandchildren.

==Political career==
In 1962, de Marco resigned his position at the Attorney General&#x27;s Office, entering the political arena - later to contest a general election. The successful criminal lawyer would henceforth dedicate much of his life to the Nationalist and Maltese cause. He became a lecturer, and later a professor of criminal law at the University of Malta.

His political career began with his election to the House of Representatives in 1966. He was returned to Parliament at every general election he contested up to 1998. He was appointed secretary general of the Nationalist party in 1972 and became the party&#x27;s deputy leader in 1977. He was elected as a representative at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe of 1967, remaining a member for almost twenty years. During his career as Minister for the Interior and Justice, De Marco&#x27;s efforts led to the integration into domestic law of important international conventions, particularly the European Convention on Human Rights. As Minister for the Interior, he pioneered the reforms and modernisations in the Police Force, being instrumental in the founding of the Police Academy. 

As Minister for Foreign Affairs he submitted Malta&#x27;s application for membership of the European Communities. It was one of his first acts as Minister for Foreign Affairs, occurring on 16 July 1990. He was a major player in the consolidation of Malta&#x27;s contributions to international organisations, including the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the Commonwealth of Nations. In 1990 he also served as President of the United Nations General Assembly.

==Presidency==

On 4 April 1999, de Marco was appointed President of Malta. He led his country into the European Union in 2004.

He became an honorary doctor at St. Petersburg State University in 2004 &quot;for achievements in science and politics, in particular, for his efforts to integrate Malta into the EU.&quot;

==Declining health and death==
On 5 August 2010, de Marco underwent an angioplasty to widen an obstructed heart artery. The intervention developed complications which led him to a critical, but stable condition. A series of medical bulletins were issued immediately by the medical team at Mater Dei Hospital, stating that De Marco was responding to treatment and showing signs of improvement. His condition continued to improve by the hour, to the extent of being taken off life-support machines. Five days later he was discharged from Mater Dei Hospital, but monitored closely by the medical team.

On 12 August 2010, de Marco gave an interview with Maltese newspaper &quot;The Times of Malta&quot;, in which he said: &quot;When I came round from the coma I no longer felt I was going to die. I felt I was going to remain. I&#x27;m here to stay ... for now at least.&quot;

However, in the afternoon, de Marco was rushed to Mater Dei Hospital once more, after collapsing in his home in Sliema. He died at the hospital. The news of his death shocked the nation, which was at the moment relieved with the previous improvement in his condition. The government declared three days of national mourning. A state funeral was held on Monday, August 16, 2010.

Messages of solidarity and expressions of sorrow were issued immediately by the President of the Republic, the Nationalist Party, the Labour Party, as well as from other entities and the diplomatic corps. The Maltese prime minister Lawrence Gonzi, interrupted his vacation to return to the island. Gonzi declared that &quot;Malta lost one of the most prominent politicians in recent times. He was fundamental for the country&#x27;s independence, contributed to strengthening democracy, served very important roles in strengthening our country&#x27;s international relations and occupied important roles in the United Nations. His Presidency has united the country.&quot; Opposition leader Joseph Muscat called the death &quot;a national loss.&quot; Edward Fenech Adami, De Marco&#x27;s successor as President of Malta, was said to be &quot;shaken&quot; by the news, hailing De Marco as &quot;a protagonist in the past forty to fifty years of Maltese history.&quot; Fenech Adami&#x27;s successor, George Abela, President of Malta at the time of de Marco&#x27;s death, added that &quot;Academically, [Guido de Marco] definitely excelled,&quot; calling him a &quot;jovial person...[who]...sang along throughout the recent Joseph Calleja concert.&quot; Abela expressed his condolences personally to the De Marco family at Mater Dei Hospital.

Tributes flowed into Malta from abroad. President of the European Parliament Jerzy Buzek called him &quot;a highly respected politician and statesman ... who was deeply respected all over Europe.&quot; Former Libyan ambassador to Malta Saad Elshlmani said &quot;On a personal level he was more than just a friend,&quot; adding that &quot;people in the Middle East will remember him for his great attachment to the issues of tolerance, cooperation and friendship.&quot; United States ambassador Douglas Kmiec also issued a statement: &quot;His tenure as President of the United Nations General Assembly, and his skill and perseverance in guiding Malta to EU membership are great tributes to his statesmanship.&quot;

His funeral took place on 16 August 2010, attended by dignitaries, including Kuwaiti Prime Minister Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, the widow of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, Suha Arafat, Italian Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, Vincenzo Scotti, and several ambassadors.

<text>Charles Buller (6 August 1806 – 29 November 1848) was a British barrister, politician and reformer.

==Background and education==
Born in Calcutta, British India, Buller was the son of Charles Buller (1774–1848), a member of a well-known Cornish family, and Barbara Isabella Kirkpatrick, daughter of General William Kirkpatrick, considered an exceptionally talented woman. His younger brother was Sir Arthur William Buller. He was educated at Harrow, then privately in Edinburgh by Thomas Carlyle, and afterwards at Trinity College, Cambridge, gaining his BA in 1828. He had been admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1824, and became a barrister in 1831.

==Political career==
Before this date, however, Buller had succeeded his father as Member of Parliament for West Looe. After the passing of the Reform Bill of 1832 and the consequent disenfranchisement of this borough, he was returned to Parliament for Liskeard, a seat he retained until he died.

An eager reformer and a friend of John Stuart Mill, Buller voted for the Great Reform Bill, favoured other progressive measures, and presided over the committee on the state of the records and the one appointed to inquire into the state of election law in Ireland in 1836. In the aftermath of the Rebellions of 1837, he went to Canada in 1838 with Lord Durham as private secretary, and served in the second session of the Special Council of Lower Canada. For a long time, it was believed that Buller wrote Lord Durham&#x27;s famous &quot;Report on the Affairs of British North America&quot;. However, this is now denied by several authorities, among them being Durham&#x27;s biographer, Stuart J Reid, who mentions that Buller described this statement as a groundless assertion in an article which he wrote for the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that the &quot;Report&quot; was largely drafted by Buller, and it almost certainly bears traces of his influence. He also wrote &quot;A Sketch of Lord Durham&#x27;s mission to Canada&quot;, which was never printed. He returned with Durham to England in the same year. Buller and Sir William Molesworth were associated with Edward Gibbon Wakefield and his schemes for colonising South Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

Buller was briefly Secretary to the Board of Control under Lord Melbourne during 1841. After practising as a barrister, he was made Judge Advocate General by Lord John Russell in 1846, and became the first President of the Poor Law Board the following year.

==Personal life==
Buller died in office in London in November 1848, aged 42. He never married. He was considered a very talented man, witty, popular and generous, and is described by Carlyle as &quot;the genialest radical I have ever met&quot;. Among his intimate friends were Grote, Thackeray, Monckton Milnes and Lady Ashburton. A bust of Buller is in Westminster Abbey, and another was unveiled at Liskeard in 1905. He left behind him, so Charles Greville says, a memory cherished for his delightful social qualities and a vast credit for undeveloped powers.

<text>Discrete geometry and combinatorial geometry are branches of geometry that study combinatorial properties and constructive methods of discrete geometric objects. Most questions in discrete geometry involve finite or discrete sets of basic geometric objects, such as points, lines, planes, circles, spheres, polygons, and so forth. The subject focuses on the combinatorial properties of these objects, such as how they intersect one another, or how they may be arranged to cover a larger object.

Discrete geometry has a large overlap with convex geometry and computational geometry, and is closely related to subjects such as finite geometry, combinatorial optimization, digital geometry, discrete differential geometry, geometric graph theory, toric geometry, and combinatorial topology.

==History==
Polyhedra and tessellations had been studied for many years by people such as Kepler and Cauchy, modern discrete geometry has its origins in the late 19th century. Early topics studied were: the density of circle packings by Thue, projective configurations by Reye and Steinitz, the geometry of numbers by Minkowski, and map colourings by Tait, Heawood, and Hadwiger.

László Fejes Tóth, H.S.M. Coxeter, and Paul Erdős laid the foundations of &quot;discrete geometry&quot;.

==Topics==

===Polyhedra and polytopes===

A polytope is a geometric object with flat sides, which exists in any general number of dimensions. A polygon is a polytope in two dimensions, a polyhedron in three dimensions, and so on in higher dimensions (such as a 4-polytope in four dimensions). Some theories further generalize the idea to include such objects as unbounded polytopes (apeirotopes and tessellations), and abstract polytopes.

The following are some of the aspects of polytopes studied in discrete geometry:
*Polyhedral combinatorics
*Lattice polytopes
*Ehrhart polynomials
*Pick&#x27;s theorem
*Hirsch conjecture
*Opaque set

===Packings, coverings and tilings===
Packings, coverings, and tilings are all ways of arranging uniform objects (typically circles, spheres, or tiles) in a regular way on a surface or manifold.

A sphere packing is an arrangement of non-overlapping spheres within a containing space. The spheres considered are usually all of identical size, and the space is usually three-dimensional Euclidean space. However, sphere packing problems can be generalised to consider unequal spheres, &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space (where the problem becomes circle packing in two dimensions, or hypersphere packing in higher dimensions) or to non-Euclidean spaces such as hyperbolic space.

A tessellation of a flat surface is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In mathematics, tessellations can be generalized to higher dimensions.

Specific topics in this area include:
*Circle packings
*Sphere packings
*Kepler conjecture
*Quasicrystals
*Aperiodic tilings
*Periodic graph
*Finite subdivision rules

===Structural rigidity and flexibility===

Structural rigidity is a combinatorial theory for predicting the flexibility of ensembles formed by rigid bodies connected by flexible linkages or hinges.

Topics in this area include:
*Cauchy&#x27;s theorem
*Flexible polyhedra

===Incidence structures===

Incidence structures generalize planes (such as affine, projective, and Möbius planes) as can be seen from their axiomatic definitions. Incidence structures also generalize the higher-dimensional analogs and the finite structures are sometimes called finite geometries.

Formally, an incidence structure is a triple
:formula_1

where &quot;P&quot; is a set of &quot;points&quot;, &quot;L&quot; is a set of &quot;lines&quot; and formula_2 is the incidence relation. The elements of formula_3 are called flags. If
:formula_4

we say that point &quot;p&quot; &quot;lies on&quot; line formula_5.

Topics in this area include:
*Configurations
*Line arrangements
*Hyperplane arrangements
*Buildings

===Oriented matroids===

An oriented matroid is a mathematical structure that abstracts the properties of directed graphs and of arrangements of vectors in a vector space over an ordered field (particularly for partially ordered vector spaces). In comparison, an ordinary (i.e., non-oriented) matroid abstracts the dependence properties that are common both to graphs, which are not necessarily &quot;directed&quot;, and to arrangements of vectors over fields, which are not necessarily &quot;ordered&quot;.

===Geometric graph theory===

A geometric graph is a graph in which the vertices or edges are associated with geometric objects. Examples include Euclidean graphs, the 1-skeleton of a polyhedron or polytope, unit disk graphs, and visibility graphs.

Topics in this area include:
*Graph drawing
*Polyhedral graphs
*Random geometric graphs
*Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations

===Simplicial complexes===

A simplicial complex is a topological space of a certain kind, constructed by &quot;gluing together&quot; points, line segments, triangles, and their &quot;n&quot;-dimensional counterparts (see illustration). Simplicial complexes should not be confused with the more abstract notion of a simplicial set appearing in modern simplicial homotopy theory. The purely combinatorial counterpart to a simplicial complex is an abstract simplicial complex. See also random geometric complexes.

===Topological combinatorics===

The discipline of combinatorial topology used combinatorial concepts in topology and in the early 20th century this turned into the field of algebraic topology.

In 1978, the situation was reversed – methods from algebraic topology were used to solve a problem in combinatorics – when László Lovász proved the Kneser conjecture, thus beginning the new study of topological combinatorics. Lovász&#x27;s proof used the Borsuk-Ulam theorem and this theorem retains a prominent role in this new field. This theorem has many equivalent versions and analogs and has been used in the study of fair division problems.

Topics in this area include:
*Sperner&#x27;s lemma
*Regular maps

===Lattices and discrete groups===

A discrete group is a group &quot;G&quot; equipped with the discrete topology. With this topology, &quot;G&quot; becomes a topological group. A discrete subgroup of a topological group &quot;G&quot; is a subgroup &quot;H&quot; whose relative topology is the discrete one. For example, the integers, Z, form a discrete subgroup of the reals, R (with the standard metric topology), but the rational numbers, Q, do not.

A lattice in a locally compact topological group is a discrete subgroup with the property that the quotient space has finite invariant measure. In the special case of subgroups of R&quot;n&quot;, this amounts to the usual geometric notion of a lattice, and both the algebraic structure of lattices and the geometry of the totality of all lattices are relatively well understood. Deep results of Borel, Harish-Chandra, Mostow, Tamagawa, M. S. Raghunathan, Margulis, Zimmer obtained from the 1950s through the 1970s provided examples and generalized much of the theory to the setting of nilpotent Lie groups and semisimple algebraic groups over a local field. In the 1990s, Bass and Lubotzky initiated the study of &quot;tree lattices&quot;, which remains an active research area.

Topics in this area include:
*Reflection groups
*Triangle groups

===Digital geometry===

Digital geometry deals with discrete sets (usually discrete point sets) considered to be digitized models or images of objects of the 2D or 3D Euclidean space.

Simply put, digitizing is replacing an object by a discrete set of its points. The images we see on the TV screen, the raster display of a computer, or in newspapers are in fact digital images.

Its main application areas are computer graphics and image analysis.

===Discrete differential geometry===

Discrete differential geometry is the study of discrete counterparts of notions in differential geometry. Instead of smooth curves and surfaces, there are polygons, meshes, and simplicial complexes. It is used in the study of computer graphics and topological combinatorics.

Topics in this area include:

*Discrete Laplace operator
*Discrete exterior calculus
*Discrete calculus
*Discrete Morse theory
*Topological combinatorics
*Spectral shape analysis
*Analysis on fractals

<text>Shamil Salmanovich Basayev (; 14 January 1965 – 10 July 2006), also known by his &quot;kunya&quot; Abu Idris, was a Chechen guerrilla leader who served as a senior military commander in the breakaway Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. He held the rank of brigadier general in the Armed Forces of Ichkeria, and was posthumously declared generalissimo. As a military commander in the separatist armed forces of Chechnya, one of his most notable battles was the separatist recapture of Grozny in 1996, which he personally planned and commanded together with Aslan Maskhadov. He also masterminded several of the worst terrorist attacks that occurred in Russia.

Starting as a field commander in the Transcaucasus, Basayev led guerrilla campaigns against Russian forces for years, as well as launching mass-hostage takings of civilians, with his goal being the withdrawal of Russian soldiers from Chechnya. From 1997 to 1998, he also served as the vice-prime minister of the breakaway state in Aslan Maskhadov&#x27;s government. Beginning in 2003, Basayev used the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; and title of &quot;&quot;Emir&quot; Abdullah Shamil Abu-Idris&quot;. As Basayev&#x27;s ruthless reputation gained notoriety, he became well revered among his peers and eventually became the highest ranking Chechen military commander and was considered the undisputed leader of the Chechen insurgency as well as being the overall senior leader of all other Chechen rebel factions.

He ordered the Budyonnovsk hospital raid in 1995, the Beslan school siege in 2004, and was responsible for numerous attacks on security forces in and around Chechnya. He also masterminded the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis and the 2004 Russian aircraft bombings. ABC News described him as &quot;one of the most-wanted terrorists in the world&quot;. Despite his aura, journalist Tom de Waal described him as &quot;almost unassuming in the flesh&quot;, being &quot;of medium height, with a bushy beard and high forehead worthy of a Moscow intellectual, and a quiet voice.&quot;

Basayev was killed in a truck explosion during an arms deal in July 2006. Forensic evidence suggests that his death was caused when a landmine he was examining exploded, but Russian officials have also claimed that one of the Kamaz trucks used was booby-trapped and detonated to destroy the arms shipment, also killing Basayev.

==Biography==
===Family history===
Shamil Basayev was born in the village of Dyshne-Vedeno, near Vedeno, in south-eastern Chechnya, in 1965 to Chechen parents from the Belghatoy teip. He was named after Imam Shamil, the third imam of Chechnya and Dagestan and one of the leaders of anti-Russian Chechen-Avar forces in the Caucasian War.

His family is said to have had a long history of involvement in Chechen resistance to foreign occupation, especially Russian rule.

His grandfather fought for the abortive attempt to create a breakaway North Caucasian Emirate after the Russian Revolution.

The Basayevs, along with most of the rest of the Chechen population, had been deported to Kazakhstan during World War II in an act of ethnic cleansing on the orders of the NKVD leader Lavrenti Beria. They were only allowed to return when the deportation order was lifted by Nikita Khrushchev in 1957.

===Early life and education===
Basayev, an avid football player, graduated from school in Dyshne-Vedeno in 1982, aged 17, and spent the next two years in the Soviet military serving as a firefighter. For the next four years, he worked at the Aksaiisky state farm in the Volgograd region of southern Russia before moving to Moscow.
He reportedly attempted to enroll in the law school of the Moscow State University but failed, and instead entered the Moscow Engineering Institute of Land Management in 1987. However, he was expelled for poor grades in 1988. He subsequently worked as a computer salesman in Moscow, in partnership with a local Chechen businessman, Supyan Taramov. Ironically, the two men ended up on opposite sides in the Chechen wars, during which Taramov sponsored a pro-Russian Chechen militia (&quot;Sobaka magazine&quot;″s dossier on Basayev reported that Taramov apparently equipped or &quot;outfitted&quot; this group of pro-Russian Chechens; they were also known as &quot;Shamil Hunters&quot;).

==Personal life==
Basayev had four wives, a Chechen woman who was killed in the 1990s, an Abkhaz woman he met while fighting against Georgia, and a Cossack he was said to have married on Valentine&#x27;s Day, 2005. A fourth secret wife, Elina Ersenoyeva, was apparently forced to marry Basayev under threat of her two brothers&#x27; lives, and subsequently hid the identity of her husband from her friends and family. Following revelations about the marriage, Elina was abducted in November 2006, four months after the death of Basayev, allegedly by the Kadyrovtsy (&quot;pro-Kremlin&quot; Chechen forces). She has never been found.

In May 1995, eleven members of Basayev&#x27;s family were killed in a Russian air raid including his mother, his two children and a brother and sister. He also lost his home in the same attack, becoming the first Chechen who took revenge outside Chechen lands, in the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis.

He lost a leg in 2000 during the Second Chechen War.

His younger brother, Shirvani Basayev, who fought the Russians alongside him, is now living in exile in Turkey.

==Early militant activities==
When some hardline members of Soviet government attempted to stage a coup d&#x27;état in August 1991, Basayev allegedly joined supporters of Russian President Boris Yeltsin on the barricades around the Russian White House in central Moscow, armed with hand grenades.

A few months later, in November 1991, the Chechen nationalist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev unilaterally declared independence from the newly formed Russian Federation. In response, Yeltsin announced a state of emergency and dispatched troops to the border of Chechnya. It was then that Basayev began his long career as an insurgent—seeking to draw international attention to the crisis. Basayev, Lom-Ali Chachayev, and the group&#x27;s leader, Said-Ali Satuyev, a former airline pilot suffering from schizophrenia, hijacked an Aeroflot Tu-154 plane, en route from Mineralnye Vody in Russia to Ankara on 9 November 1991, and threatened to blow up the aircraft unless the state of emergency was lifted. The hijacking was resolved peacefully in Turkey, with the plane and passengers being allowed to return safely and the hijackers given safe passage back to Chechnya.

==Nagorno-Karabakh conflict==
Basayev moved to Azerbaijan in 1992, where he assisted Azerbaijani forces in their unsuccessful war against Armenian fighters in the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. He was said to have led a battalion-strength Chechen contingent. According to Azeri Colonel Azer Rustamov, in 1992, &quot;hundreds of Chechen volunteers rendered us invaluable help in these battles led by Shamil Basayev and Salman Raduyev.&quot; Basayev was said to be one of the last fighters to leave Shusha (see Capture of Shusha). He ordered the withdrawal of the Chechen detachments from Karabakh in 1993, stating that they had entered the region for a Jihad, but saw not a single sign of it.

==Abkhaz–Georgian conflict==
Later in 1992, Basayev traveled to Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia, to assist the local separatist movement against the Georgian government&#x27;s attempts to regain control of the region. Basayev became the commander-in-chief of the forces of the Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus (a volunteer unit of pan-North Caucasian nationalists, people from the North Caucasus). Their involvement was crucial in the Abkhazian war and in October 1993 the Georgian government suffered a decisive military defeat. It was rumored that the volunteers were trained and supplied by some part of the Russian army&#x27;s GRU military intelligence service. According to &quot;The Independent&quot; journalist Patrick Cockburn, &quot;cooperation between Mr Basayev and the Russian army is not so surprising as it sounds. In 1992–93 he is widely believed to have received assistance from the GRU when he and his brother Shirvani fought in Abkhazia, a breakaway part of Georgia.&quot; No specific evidence was given.

===Accusations of being a GRU agent===
The Russian government newspaper &quot;Rossiyskaya Gazeta&quot; reported that Basayev was an agent of GRU, and another publication by journalist Boris Kagarlitsky said that &quot;It is maintained, for example, that Shamil Basayev and his brother Shirvani are long-standing GRU agents, and that all their activities were agreed, not with the radical Islamists, but with the generals sitting in the military intelligence offices. All the details of the attack by Basayev&#x27;s detachments were supposedly worked out in the summer of 1999 in a villa in the south of France with the participation of Basayev and the Head of the Presidential administration, Aleksandr Voloshin. Furthermore, it is alleged that the explosive materials used were not supplied from secret bases in Chechnya but from GRU stockpiles near Moscow.&quot; The Russian newspaper &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; stated that the Basayev brothers &quot;both recruited as agents by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian General Staff (GRU) in 1991–92.&quot; The Russian newspaper &quot;Versiya&quot; published a file from the Russian foreign military agency on Basayev and his brother, which stated that &quot;both Chechen terrorists were named as regular agents of the military intelligence organization.&quot; In a July 2020 interview, the former Russian Federal Security Service chief Sergei Stepashin admitted that Basayev cooperated with military intelligence while fighting against Georgian government in Abkhazia.

Russian special forces joined with the Chechens under Basayev to attack Georgia. A GRU agent, Anton Surikov, had extensive connections with Basayev. Russian military intelligence had ordered Basayev to support the Abkhaz.

Basayev received direct military training from the GRU since the Abkhaz were backed by Russia. Other Chechens also were trained by the GRU in warfare, many of these Chechens who fought for the Russians in Abkhazia against Georgia had fought for Azerbaijan against Armenia in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War.

The Russians allowed Basayev to travel between Russia and Abkhazia to battle the Georgians.

In an interview with Nezavisimaya Gazeta on March 12, 1996, Basayev denied the information that he was trained on the basis of the Russian 345th Airborne Regiment: “Not a single Chechen studied there, because they were not accepted.”

Representatives of Chechen separatists have always rejected allegations of Basayev&#x27;s cooperation with Russian intelligence services, calling them a deliberate attempt to discredit Basayev in the eyes of his supporters.

===War crimes===
According to Paul J. Murphy, &quot;Russian military intelligence turned a blind eye to the 1991 terrorist arrest warrant against Basayev to train him and his detachment in Abkhazia, and the Russians even helped direct Basayev&#x27;s combat operations&quot; and &quot;long after the war, Basayev praised the professionalism and courage of his Russian trainers in Abkhazia – praise that led some of his enemies in Grozny, even President Maskhadov, to later call him a &quot;longtime GRU agent&quot;.

In 1993 Basayev lead the CMPC corps of North Caucasian volunteers, according to allegations made by Georgian tabloids, the volunteers led by him had decapitated Georgian civilians. After an investigation by a commission composed of Russian deputies, as well as a commission led by UNPO lawyer and investigator Michael van Praag, they could not find any proof for such an incident ever taking place. The tabloid in question also admitted in November that they had no proof to confirm that such an incident had taken place.

==Allegations of links with Pakistan&#x27;s ISI==
Having already been noticed in Afghanistan, where he fought as a young man, and then in Abkhazia in Georgia, Basayev would further attract the attention of Pakistan&#x27;s premier intelligence agency, the ISI: under Pakistani command, and after meeting many powerful personalities of the army, including the DG ISI Javed Ashraf Qazi, he would be one of the 1,500-strong Afghan mujahideen contingent which fought the Armenians during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and in April 1994, the ISI would eventually arrange &quot;a refresher course for Basayev and some of his NCOs in guerrilla warfare and Islamic learning in the Amir Munawid Camp in Khost province in Afghanistan&quot;, with Basayev also having further specialized training in Pakistan proper, in cities like Rawalpindi, Peshawar and Muridke, near Lahore. They were also given Stingers, anti-tank rockets and advanced explosives, which would be later used to shoot down Russian combat airplanes and dozens of helicopters. Ultimately, hundreds of Chechens would be trained in Khost, under the ISI as well as the Pakistan-based Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Ansar, and one of its commanders, Abu Abdullah Jaffa, once in Pakistan&#x27;s Northern Light Infantry, would work closely with Basayev over the years, as for instance he&#x27;s supposed to be the one who planned the invasion of Dagestan.

Basayev&#x27;s own account of his activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan is as such, as given in a September 2003 interview to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;:I was interested in the Afghan experience on the defence engineering constructions, air defense system and mine-explosive works. Therefore, I went first to Peshawar (Pakistan). There, I lived with some Tajiks and through them I agreed for training for 200 Chechens. I sold at home some captured weaponry, seized in June from Labazanov’s band in then Groznyi, took also some money from my acquaintances and transported the first group of 12 people to Afghanistan. There I spent a night in the training camp and in the morning I returned to Karachi to meet the second group. But at the airport they aroused a suspicion because of their number and they didn’t have their passports in their hands. The Russians raised a large noise and in the week they sent us back.

==Basayev&#x27;s role in the First Chechen War==
;1994–1995

The First Chechen War began when Russian forces invaded Chechnya on 11 December 1994, to depose the government of Dzhokhar Dudayev. With the outbreak of war, Dudayev made Basayev one of the front-line commanders. Basayev took an active role in the resistance, successfully commanding his &quot;Abkhaz Battalion.&quot; The unit inflicted major losses on Russian forces in the Battle of Grozny, Chechnya&#x27;s capital, which lasted from December 1994 to February 1995. Basayev&#x27;s men were among the last fighters to abandon the city.

;1995
After capturing Grozny, the momentum changed in favor of the Russian forces, and by April Chechen forces had been pushed into the mountains with most of their equipment destroyed. Basayev&#x27;s &quot;Abkhaz Battalion&quot; suffered many casualties, particularly during battles around Vedeno in May and their ranks sank to as low as 200 men, critically low on supplies.

Around this time, Basayev also suffered a personal tragedy. On 3 June 1995, during a Russian air raid on Basayev&#x27;s hometown of Dyshne-Vedeno, two bombs targeted the home of Basayev&#x27;s uncle, killing six children, four women as well as his uncle. Basayev&#x27;s wife, child and his sister Zinaida were among the dead. Twelve additional members of Basayev&#x27;s family were also seriously wounded in the attack. One of his brothers was also killed in fighting near Vedeno.

In an attempt to force a stop to the Russian advance, some Chechen forces resorted to a series of attacks directed against civilian targets outside the area that they claimed. Basayev led the most infamous such attack, the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis on 14 June 1995, less than two weeks after he lost his family in the air raids. Basayev&#x27;s large band seized the Budyonnovsk hospital in southern Russia and the 1,600 people inside for a period of several days. At least 129 civilians died and 415 were wounded during the crisis as the Russian special forces repeatedly attempted to free the hostages by force. Although Basayev failed in his principal demand for the removal of Russian forces from Chechnya, he did successfully negotiate a stop to the Russian advance and an initiation of peace talks with the Russian government, saving the Chechen resistance by giving them time to regroup and recover. Basayev and his fighters then returned to Chechnya under cover of human shields.

On 23 November, Basayev announced on the Russian NTV television channel, that four cases of radioactive material had been hidden around Moscow. Russian emergency teams roamed the city with Geiger counters, and located several canisters of caesium, which had been stolen from the Budennovsk hospital by the Chechen militants. The incident has been called &quot;the most important sub-state use of radiological material.&quot;

;1996

By 1996 Basayev had been promoted to the rank of General and Commander of the Chechen Armed Forces. In July 1996 he was implicated in the death of the rogue Chechen warlord Ruslan Labazanov.

In August 1996, he led a successful operation to retake the Chechen capital Grozny, defeating the Russian garrison of the city. Yeltsin&#x27;s government finally moved for peace, bringing in former Soviet–Afghan War General Aleksandr Lebed as a negotiator. A peace agreement was concluded between the Chechens and Russians, under which the Chechens acquired &quot;de facto&quot; independence from Russia.

==Interwar period==
Basayev stepped down from his military position in December 1996 to run for president in Chechnya&#x27;s second (and the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria&#x27;s first and only ever internationally monitored) presidential elections. Basayev came in second place to Aslan Maskhadov, obtaining 23.5% of the votes. Allegedly Basayev found the defeat very painful.

In early 1997 he was appointed deputy Prime Minister of Chechnya by Maskhadov. He briefly served as acting leader of Chechnya during President Maskhadov&#x27;s trip to the Middle East in 1997. In January 1998 he became the acting head of the Chechen government for a six-month term, after which he resigned. Basayev&#x27;s appointment was symbolic because it took place on the eve of the celebrations of the 200th anniversary of his renowned namesake. Basayev subsequently reduced the government&#x27;s administrative departments and abolished several ministries. However, the collection of taxes and the Chechen National Bank&#x27;s reserves shrank, and theft of petroleum products increased seriously.

Maskhadov worked with Basayev until 1998, when Basayev established a network of military officers, who soon became rival warlords. As Chechnya collapsed into chaos, Basayev&#x27;s reputation began to plummet as he and others were accused of corruption and involvement in kidnapping; his alliance with Khattab also alienated many Chechens. By early 1998 Basayev emerged as the main political opponent of the Chechen president, who in his opinion was &quot;pushing the republic back to the Russian Federation.&quot; On 31 March 1998, Basayev called for the termination of talks with Russia; on 7 July 1998, he sent a letter of resignation from his post as the Chechen Prime Minister. During these years he wrote &quot;Book of a Mujahiddeen&quot;, an Islamic guerrilla manual.

==Incursion into Dagestan==

In December 1997, after Movladi Udugov&#x27;s Islamic Nation party had called for Chechnya to annex territories in
neighbouring Dagestan, Basayev promised to &quot;liberate&quot; neighbouring Dagestan from its status as &quot;a Russian colony.&quot;

According to Alex Goldfarb and Marina Litvinenko&#x27;s book &quot;Death of a Dissident&quot;, Kremlin-critic Boris Berezovsky said that he had a conversation with the Chechen Islamist leader Movladi Udugov in 1999, six months before the beginning of fighting in Dagestan. A transcript of the phone conversation between Berezovsky and Udugov was leaked to one of Moscow tabloids on 10 September 1999. Udugov proposed to start the Dagestan war to provoke the Russian response, topple the Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov and establish new Islamic republic of Basayev-Udugov that would be friendly to Russia. Berezovsky asserted that he refused the offer, but &quot;Udugov and Basayev conspired with Stepashin and Putin to provoke a war to topple Maskhadov ... but the agreement was for the Russian army to stop at the Terek River. However, Putin double-crossed the Chechens and started an all-out war.&quot;

It was also alleged that Alexander Voloshin, a key figure in the Yeltsin administration, paid Basayev to stage the Dagestan incursion, and that Basayev was working for the Russian GRU at the time. According to the BBC, conspiracy theories are part of the staple diet of Moscow politics.

In August 1999, Basayev and Khattab led a 1,400-strong group of militants in an unsuccessful attempt to aid Dagestani Wahhabists to take over the neighboring Republic of Dagestan and establish an Islamic republic and start an uprising. By the end of the month, Russian forces had managed to repel the invasion.

===1999 apartment bombings===
In early September, a series of bombings of Russian apartment blocks took place, killing 293 people. Russia quickly blamed the attacks on Chechen militants without any evidence. Basayev, Ibn Al-Khattab and Achemez Gochiyaev were named by Russia as key suspects. Basayev and Khattab denied any involvement in the attacks, with Basayev stating whoever committed them are not human. According to a Russian FSB spokesman, Gochiyaev&#x27;s group was trained at Chechen militant bases in the towns of Serzhen-Yurt and Urus-Martan, where the explosives were prepared. The group&#x27;s &quot;technical instructors&quot; were two Arab field commanders, Abu Umar and Abu Djafar, and Al-Khattab was the bombings&#x27; brainchild. Two members of Gochiyayev&#x27;s group that carried out the attacks, Adam Dekkushev and Yusuf Crymshamhalov, have been sentenced to life term each in a special-regime colony. According to FSB, Basayev and Al-Khattab masterminded the attacks. Al-Khattab has been killed, but Gochiyaev remains a fugitive.

Although Basayev and Khattab denied responsibility, the Russian government blamed the Chechen government for allowing Basayev to use Chechnya as a base. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov denied any involvement in the attacks, and offered a crackdown on the renegade warlords, which Russia refused. Commenting on the attacks, Shamil Basayev said: &quot;The latest blast in Moscow is not our work, but the work of the Dagestanis. Russia has been openly terrorizing Dagestan, it encircled three villages in the centre of Dagestan, did not allow women and children to leave.&quot; Al-Khattab, who was reportedly close with Basayev, said the attacks were a response to what the Russians had done in Karamakhi and Chabanmakhi, two Dagestani villages where followers of the Wahhabi sect were living until the Russian army bombed them out. A group called the Liberation army of Dagestan claimed responsibility for the apartment bombings.

==Second Chechen War==
Michael Radu of the &quot;Foreign Policy Research Institute&quot; said &quot;Basayev managed to radically change the world&#x27;s perception of the Chechen cause, from that of a small nation resisting victimization by Russian imperialism into another outpost of the global jihad. In the process, he also significantly modified the very nature of Islam in Chechnya and Northern Caucasus, from a traditional mix of syncretism and Sufism into one strongly influenced by Wahhabism and Salafism—especially among the youth. With Wahhabism came expansionism.&quot;

;1999
Basayev stayed in Grozny for the duration of the siege of the city. His threats of &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks in Russia were widely dismissed as a bluff.

;2000
During the Chechens&#x27; retreat from Grozny in January 2000 Basayev lost a foot after stepping on a land mine while leading his men through a minefield. The operation to amputate his foot and part of his leg was videotaped by Adam Tepsurgayev and later televised by Russia&#x27;s NTV network and Reuters, showing his foot being removed by Khassan Baiev using a local anaesthetic while Basayev watched impassively.

Despite this injury, Basayev eluded Russian capture together with other Chechens by hiding in forests and mountains. He welcomed assistance from foreign fighters from Afghanistan and other Islamic countries, encouraging them to join the Chechen cause. He also ordered the execution of nine Russian OMON prisoners on 4 April 2000; the men were killed because the Russians had refused to swap them for Yuri Budanov, an arrested army officer accused of raping and killing an 18-year-old Chechen girl.

;2001
According to the US State Department, Basayev trained in Afghanistan in 2001. The US also alleges that Basayev and Khattab sent Chechens to serve in Al-Qaeda&#x27;s &quot;055&quot; brigade, fighting alongside the Taliban against the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan.

On 2 June 2001, it was reported General Gennady Troshev, then-commander-in-chief of Russian forces in Chechnya, had offered a bounty of one million dollars to anyone who would bring him the head of Basayev.

In August, Basayev commanded a large-scale raid on the Vedensky District. A deputy commander of Russian forces in Chechnya claimed Basayev was wounded in a firefight.

;2002
In January 2002, Basayev&#x27;s father, Salman, was reputedly killed by Russian forces. This has not been independently confirmed. Shamil&#x27;s younger brother, Shirvani, was reported killed by the Russians in 2000, but is, according to numerous accounts, actually living in exile in Turkey where he is involved in coordination of the activities of the diaspora.

In May, the Russian side declared Basayev &quot;dead&quot;.The Russian military had also made several claims about Basayev&#x27;s alleged death in the past.

Around 2 November 2002, Basayev claimed on a militant website that he was responsible for the Moscow theater hostage crisis (although the siege was led by Movsar Barayev) in which 50 Chechens held about 800 people hostage; Russian forces later stormed the building using gas, killing the Chechens and more than 100 hostages. Basayev also tendered his resignation from all posts in Maskhadov&#x27;s government apart from the reconnaissance and sabotage battalion. He defended the operation but asked Maskhadov for forgiveness for not informing him of it. The answer to who was behind the hostage taking, however, is not so clear – some dissidents claim, including Alexander Litvinenko, was that the FSB was behind the Moscow theater incident.

On 27 December 2002, Chechen suicide bombers rammed vehicles into the republic&#x27;s government headquarters in Grozny, bringing down the four-story building and killing about 80 people. Basayev claimed responsibility, published the video of the attack, and said he personally triggered the bombs by remote control.

;2003
On 12 May 2003, suicide bombers rammed a truck loaded with explosives into a Russian government compound in Znamenskoye, northern Chechnya, killing 59 people. Two days later a woman got within six feet of Akhmad Kadyrov, the head of the Moscow-appointed Chechen administration, and blew herself up killing herself and 14 people; Kadyrov was unhurt. Basayev claimed responsibility for both attacks; Maskhadov denounced them.

From June until August 2003 Basayev lived in the town of Baksan in nearby Kabardino-Balkaria. Eventually, a skirmish took place between when local policemen came to check the house he was staying in. Basayev escaped the incident.

On 8 August 2003, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell designated Shamil Basayev as a threat to U.S. security and citizens, saying that Basayev &quot;has committed or poses a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States&quot;. In February, the U.S. State Department designated three Chechen groups with links to al-Qaeda, including the Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade, stating that Osama bin-Laden had sent &quot;substantial&quot; amounts to its founders Basayev and Ibn al-Khattab. The United Nations Security Council also placed Basayev on its official list of terrorists after the U.S. designation.

In late 2003, Basayev claimed responsibility for terrorist bombings in both Moscow and Yessentuki in Stavropol Krai. He said both attacks were carried out by the group operating under his command.

;2004
On 9 May 2004, the pro-Russian Chechen President Akhmad Kadyrov was killed in Grozny in a bomb attack for which Basayev later claimed responsibility. That explosion killed at least six people and wounded nearly 60, including the top Russian military commander in Chechnya, who lost his leg; Basayev called it a &quot;small but important victory&quot;.

Basayev was accused of commanding the 21 June raid on Nazran in the Russian republic of Ingushetia. In fact, he was shown in a video made of the raid, in which he led a large group of militants. Around 90 people died in this attack, mostly local servicemen and officials of the Russian security forces including the republic&#x27;s acting interior minister. The Ministry building was burned down.

In September 2004 Basayev claimed responsibility for the Beslan school siege in which over 350 people, most of them children, were killed and hundreds more injured. The Russian government put up a bounty of 300m rubles ($10m) for information leading to his capture. Basayev himself did not participate in the seizure of the school, but claimed to have organized and financed the attack, boasting that the whole operation cost only 8,000 euros. On 17 September 2004, Basayev issued a statement claiming responsibility for the school siege, saying his Riyadus-Salihiin &quot;Martyr Battalion&quot; had carried out this and other attacks. In his message, Basayev described the Beslan massacre as a &quot;terrible tragedy&quot;. He blamed it on Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that by Putin giving the order to storm the school he had destroyed and injured the hostages.

Basayev also claimed responsibility for the attacks against civilians during the previous week, in which a metro station in Moscow was bombed (killing 10 people), and two airliners were blown up by suicide bombers (killing 89 people). Basayev dubbed these attacks &quot;Operation Boomerang&quot;. He also said that during the Beslan crisis he offered Putin &quot;independence in exchange for security&quot;.

;2005
On 3 February 2005, UK&#x27;s Channel 4 announced that it would air Basayev&#x27;s interview. In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that the broadcast could aid terrorists in achieving their goals and demanded that the Government of the United Kingdom call off the broadcast. The British Foreign Office replied that it could not intervene in the affairs of a private TV channel and the interview was aired as scheduled. The same day, Russian media reported that Shamil Basayev had been killed; it was the sixth such report about Basayev&#x27;s demise since 1999.

In May 2005, Basayev reportedly claimed responsibility for the power outage in Moscow. The BBC reported that the claim for responsibility was made on a web site connected to Basayev, but conflicted with official reports that sabotage was not involved.

Even though Basayev had a $10 million bounty on his head, he gave an interview to Russian journalist Andrei Babitsky in which he described himself as &quot;a bad guy, a bandit, a terrorist ... but what would you call them?&quot;, referring to his enemies. Basayev stated each Russian had to feel war&#x27;s impact before the Chechen war would stop. Basayev asked &quot;Officially, over 40,000 of our children have been killed and tens of thousands mutilated. Is anyone saying anything about that? ... responsibility is with the whole Russian nation, which through its silent approval gives a &#x27;yes&#x27;.&quot; This interview was broadcast on U.S. television network ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; program, to the protest of the Russian government; on 2 August 2005, Moscow banned journalists of the ABC network from working in Russia.

On 23 August 2005, Basayev rejoined the Chechen separatist government, taking the post of first deputy chairman. Later this year Basayev claimed responsibility for a raid on Nalchik, the capital of the Russian republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. The raid occurred on 13 October 2005; Basayev said that he and his &quot;main units&quot; were only in the city for two hours and then left. There were reports that he had died during the raid, but this was contradicted when the separatist website, Kavkaz Center, posted a letter from him.

;2006
In March 2006, Prime Minister of Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, claimed that upwards of 3,000 police officers were hunting for Basayev in the southern mountains. On 15 June 2006, Basayev repeated his claim of responsibility for the bombing that killed Akhmad Kadyrov, saying he had paid $50,000 to those who carried out the assassination. He also said he had put a $25,000 bounty on the head of Ramzan, mocking the young Kadyrov in offering the smaller bounty.

On 27 June 2006, Shamil Basayev was appointed by Dokka Umarov as the Vice President of Ichkeria. On 10 July 2006, in his last statement at 1.06 pm Moscow time, Kavkaz Center quoted him as thanking the Mujahideen Shura Council for executing the three captured Russian diplomats in Iraq and calling it &quot;a worthy answer to the murder by Russian terrorists from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation of the Chechen diplomat, ex-president of CRI, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev&quot;.

==Death==
On 10 July 2006, Basayev was killed near the border of North Ossetia in the village of Ekazhevo, Ingushetia, a republic bordering Chechnya.

According to the Interior Ministry and Prosecutor of Ingushetia, a group of three cars and two KAMAZ trucks (one pulling the other by a rope) gathered at the spot of an unfinished estate on the outskirts of the village in the early morning hours of 10 July. According to a handful of witnesses, men in black uniforms came in and out from the wooded area adjacent to the estate that runs to the border of North Ossetia; the men were carrying boxes, shifting them from one vehicle to another, when a massive explosion occurred.

It is believed that the partially completed estate, which contained empty new buildings, was being used as an insurgent reception and distribution point for large quantities of weapons purchased from abroad. It is also believed that the most &quot;anticipated&quot; part of the incoming shipment was located in the KAMAZ trucks, but because one of them broke down the weaponry had to quickly be transferred into the cars.

Basayev is assumed to have been the main recipient of the arms, and thus in charge of distributing them. With the back tailgate of one of the trucks open, Basayev allegedly asked that a mine be placed on the ground for inspection, at which point it exploded. An Ossetian forensic specialist who examined Basayev&#x27;s remains stated that, &quot;The man…died of mine-blast injuries. The explosive device was quite powerful…and the victim was in close proximity to the epicenter. Most likely, the bomb lay on the ground, and the victim was bending over it.&quot;

Basayev&#x27;s upper torso was recovered at the epicenter of the blast, while smaller pieces of his remains were scattered over the distance of a mile. Included among the smaller pieces was Basayev&#x27;s prosthetic lower right leg, which led FSB Director Nikolai Patrushev to confidently assert that Basayev was dead even before positive identification.

Russian officials stated that the explosion was the result of a special targeted killing operation. According to the official version of Basayev&#x27;s death, the FSB, following him with a drone, spotted his car approach a truck laden with explosives that the FSB had prepared, and by remote control triggered a detonator that the FSB had hidden in the explosives.

Interfax, quoting Ingush Deputy Prime Minister Bashir Aushev, reported that the explosion was a result of a truck bomb detonated next to the convoy by Russian agents. According to a Russian edition of&quot; Newsweek&quot;, Basayev&#x27;s death was a result of an FSB operation, whose primary aim was to prevent a planned terrorist attack in Chechnya or Ingushetia the days before the G8 summit in St Petersburg. The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, said: &quot;He is a notorious terrorist, and we have very clearly and publicly announced what is going to happen to notorious terrorists who commit heinous crimes of the type Mr. Basayev has been involved in.&quot; In February 2014, a Turkish court convicted a Chechen national Ruslan Papaskiri aka Temur Makhauri with the killings of several Chechen separatists on Turkish soil. The pro-Chechen separatist Imkander organization held a press conference claiming that Turkish investigators believed that Makhauri had prepared the explosives laden truck that killed Basayev.

On 29 December 2006, forensic experts positively identified Basayev&#x27;s remains. On 6 October 2007, Basayev was promoted to the rank of Generalissimo &quot;post mortem&quot; by Doku Umarov.

==&quot;Book of a Mujahideen&quot;==

Basayev wrote a book after the First Chechen War, &quot;Book of a Mujahideen&quot;. According to the introduction, in March 2003 Basayev obtained a copy of &quot;The Manual of the Warrior of Light&quot; by Paulo Coelho. He wanted to draw benefits to the Mujahideen from this book and decided to &quot;rewrite most of it, remove some excesses and strengthen all of it with verses (ayats), hadiths and stories from the lives of the disciples.&quot; Some sections are specifically about ambush tactics, etc.

==Legacy==
In September 2024, it became known that a portrait of Shamil Basayev was featured in the “Heroes of Abkhazia” exhibition at the State Museum in Abkhazia. The museum was restored with Russian financial investments in 2013. After the incident was reported in the Russian media, the exhibition was closed.

===In popular culture===
Basayev appeared in 2018 Russian movie &quot;Decision: Liquidation&quot;, played by Ayub Tsingiev.

<doc id="386474" wikidata="Q1174592" url="?curid=386474" title="David Gray (poet)">
<text>David Gray (29 January 18383 December 1861) was a Scottish poet, from Merkland, Kirkintilloch. He died in his hometown aged 23. His friend and fellow poet Robert Buchanan wrote his biography in 1900.

==Life==
The son of a handloom weaver, Gray was born at Merkland, by Kirkintilloch, Dunbartonshire. His parents resolved to educate him for the Free Kirk, and through their self-denial and his own exertions as a pupil teacher and private tutor he was able to complete a course of four sessions at the university of Glasgow. He began to write poetry for &quot;Glasgow Evening Citizen&quot; and began his idyll on the Luggie, the little stream that ran through Merkland. His most intimate companion at this time was Robert Buchanan, the poet; and in May 1860 the two agreed to proceed to London, with the idea of finding literary employment.

Shortly after his arrival in London Gray introduced himself to Monckton Milnes, afterwards Lord Houghton, with whom he had previously corresponded. Lord Houghton tried to persuade him to return to Scotland, but Gray insisted on staying in London. He was unsuccessful in his efforts to place Gray&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Luggie&quot;, in &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;, but gave him some light literary work. He also showed him great kindness when a cold which had seized him assumed the serious form of consumption, and sent him to Torquay; but as the disease made rapid progress, an irresistible longing seized Gray to return to Merkland, where he arrived in January 1861, and died on 3 December following, having the day before had the gratification of seeing a printed specimen copy of his poem &quot;The Luggie&quot;, published eventually by the exertions of Sydney Dobell. He was buried in the Auld Aisle Churchyard, Kirkintilloch, where in 1865 a monument was erected by friends far and near to his memory.

==Published work==
&quot;The Luggie&quot;, the principal poem of Gray, is a kind of reverie in which the scenes and events of his childhood and his early aspirations are mingled with the music of the stream which he celebrates. The series of sonnets, In the Shadows, was composed during the latter part of his illness. Encyclopædia Britannica says that most of his poems necessarily bear traces of immaturity, and lines may frequently be found in them which are mere echoes from Thomson, Wordsworth or Tennyson, but they possess, nevertheless, distinct individuality, and show a real appreciation of natural beauty.

Below is a copy of a sonnet which is one of a number he wrote, entitled, &quot;In the shadows.&quot; His description of a wet October day shows the skill of the terminally-ill poet:

October&#x27;s gold is dim— the forests rot,

The weary rain falls ceaseless, while the day

Is wrapped in damp. In mire of village way

Tae hedge-row leaves are stamp&#x27;d, and, all forgot,

The broodless nest sits visible in the thorn.

Autumn, among her drooping marigolds,

Weeps all her garnered sheaves, and empty folds,

And dripping orchards – plundered and forlorn.

The season is a dead one, and I die !

No more, no more for me the spring shall make

A resurrection in the earth and take

The death from out her heart. O God, I die !

The cold throat mist creeps nearer, till I breathe

Corruption. Drop stark night upon my death !

&quot;The Luggie and other Poems&quot;, with an introduction by R. Monckton Milnes, and a brief memoir by James Hedderwick, was published in 1862; and a new and enlarged edition of &quot;Gray&#x27;s Poetical Works&quot;, edited by Henry Glassford Bell, appeared in 1874. See also &quot;David Gray and other Essays&quot;, by Robert Buchanan (1868), where he also has an essay on Walt Whitman. Buchanan also has a poem on David Gray, in &quot;Idyls and Legends of Inverburn&quot;. Parts of &quot;The Luggie&quot; have been narrated against a backdrop of the Luggie Water. The eponymous anthology is available and is out of copyright.

David Gray&#x27;s self penned epitaph was:

Below lies one whose name was traced in sand-

He died not knowing what it was to live:

Died while the first sweet consciousness of manhood

And maiden thought electrified his soul:

Faint beatings in the calyx of the rose.

Bewildered reader, pass without a sigh

In a proud sorrow!

There is life with God,

In other kingdom of a sweeter air:

In Eden every flower is blown: Amen.

27 September 1861.

<text>The Frisco Kid is a 1979 American Western comedy film directed by Robert Aldrich, starring Gene Wilder as Avram Belinski, a Polish rabbi who is traveling to San Francisco, and Harrison Ford as a bank robber who befriends him.

==Plot==
Rabbi Avram Belinski, newly graduated at the bottom of his class from a Polish yeshiva, arrives in Philadelphia en route to San Francisco where he will be a congregation&#x27;s new rabbi. He has with him a Torah scroll for the San Francisco synagogue. Avram, an innocent, trusting, and inexperienced traveler, falls in with three con men, the brothers Matt and Darryl Diggs and their partner Mr. Jones, who trick him into helping pay for a wagon and supplies to go west, then brutally rob him and leave him and most of his belongings scattered along a deserted road in Pennsylvania.

Still determined to make it to San Francisco, Avram, on foot and exhausted, comes upon a colony of Amish people. From their simple black clothing, he assumes fellow Hasidic Jews, until he notices Christian cross on the Bible carried in the pocket of one of the men, at which point he faints. They take care of Avram and collect enough money to get him a train ticket. In Ohio, Avram works on the railroad until he saves up enough money to buy a horse and some supplies.

On his way west again, he is befriended and looked after by a stranger named Tommy Lillard, a bank robber with a soft heart who is moved by Avram&#x27;s helplessness and frank personality, despite the trouble it occasionally gives him. When Tommy robs a bank on a Friday, Avram will not ride on the Shabbat even with a hanging posse on his trail. The two also experience Native American customs and hospitality, disrupt a Trappist monastery&#x27;s vow of silence with an innocent gesture of gratitude.

While stopping in a small town not too far from San Francisco, Avram encounters the Diggs brothers and Jones again. He gets into a fight with the three of them and, after taking a beating, is rescued by Tommy, who takes back what they had stolen from Avram and more besides. At the coast, Avram is dismayed when Tommy announces that they will be parting ways. The three bandits follow the pair and ambush them on a California beach where they have stopped to bathe. Tommy shoots Jones dead and grazes Matt, who flees the scene. Avram is forced to kill Darryl in self-defense.

In San Francisco, Avram begins to doubt whether he is qualified to be a rabbi, not just because he killed a man, but because he rushed to save the Torah over saving Tommy, who has become his best friend. Tommy restores his faith, reminding him that he still is what he is inside, despite what he had to do on the beach. However, Matt, the sole survivor of the ambushing trio, appears and challenges Avram to duel. Avram, regaining his composure, shows his wisdom and courage in front of the entire community by disarming and exiling him from San Francisco with Tommy&#x27;s help. The film ends with Avram marrying not the elder daughter to whom he had been betrothed sight unseen by her father, but Rosalie Bender, the younger daughter with whom he had fallen in love at first sight, with Tommy as his best man.

==Production==
===Development===
The film was in development for seven years. It was known as &quot;No Knife&quot; for a long time, then briefly as &quot;Greenhorn&quot; before someone suggested &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot;.

Robert Aldrich replaced director Dick Richards during pre-production. Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s really nobody&#x27;s movie. The screenplay has been around Hollywood for several years, and Aldrich seems to have taken it on as a routine assignment.&quot;

According to Gene Wilder&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art&quot;, the Tommy Lillard role, played by Harrison Ford, was originally planned for John Wayne. John J. Puccio of Movie Metropolis writes that Wayne was &quot;eager to take it on as a comic follow-up to &quot;True Grit&quot; and &quot;Rooster Cogburn&quot;. Salary concerns nixed the idea, though, and it&#x27;s questionable he would have finished the shooting, in any case, as he died shortly before &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; opened.&quot; (Another source says Wayne did not want to make the film due to &quot;vulgarity&quot; in the script.)

Wilder said he was offered the film in 1976 but turned it down. The script was rewritten, he read it again the following year and thought it was better but still turned it down. However, when he read a revised second draft he agreed to do it. Warners asked him to work on the script, so he helped with the construction of a third draft, then wrote a fourth draft.

===Production===
Filming started 30 October 1978 under the working title &quot;No Knife&quot;.

Aldrich said &quot;With the exception of Bette Davis, Gene is the best actor I&#x27;ve worked with. He&#x27;s very intuitive, very bright.&quot; Wilder also enjoyed working with Aldrich, calling the film &quot;Young Frankenstein Meets the Dirty Dozen&quot; and saying &quot;the way he chooses to do a scene is the most artistic of any director I&#x27;ve ever worked with.&quot;

Aldrich did not always get on with Harrison Ford during the shoot. &quot;I think every time Aldrich looked at Harrison, he saw John Wayne,&quot; said Mace Neufeld, the producer. &quot;Harrison was aware of that, but he was always fun to be around, very funny.&quot; Ford later said &quot;It was fun to work with Gene... [but] every time the director, Robert Aldrich, looked at me, he was thinking about how unhappy he was that he didn&#x27;t have John Wayne, instead.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned $4.7 million at the US box office in its first year.

===Critical response===
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 54% rating based on 28 reviews. The consensus summarizes: &quot;Not even a genial Gene Wilder or a dashing Harrison Ford can rescue &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; from a monotonous procession of gently comedic sketches that never cohere into a memorable yarn.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; as &quot;harmless chaos&quot;: &quot;People keep coming and going and doing ferociously cute things, but never anything that could appeal to anyone except a close relative or someone with a built-in weakness for anything ethnic whatsoever.&quot; He criticized the lack of plot development, saying that, while based on a clever idea, &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; ultimately fails to deliver on its promise.

Roger Ebert gave the movie a mixed review, admitting that after seeing &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; he was &quot;forever after spoiled on the subject of comic Westerns.&quot; &quot;The movie&#x27;s based on a good idea, yes... But what approach do you take to this material? What&#x27;s your comic tone? &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; tries for almost every possible tone.&quot;

Jordan Hiller called it one of &quot;25 Essential Jewish Movies&quot;, praising its &quot;uncommon innocence and unselfconscious humility.&quot; He called it an &quot;unpredictably paced part screwball comedy farce, part dramatic buddy picture, part spaghetti western&quot; and wrote, &quot;&quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; has the feel of an artist&#x27;s charmingly naive youthful indiscretion... &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; is, all pratfalls and tuchus jokes aside, the quintessential &#x27;Torah&#x27; movie.&quot; Reviewer Ken Hanke wrote, &quot;Robert Aldrich&#x27;s penultimate film is an easygoing work of some considerable charm that relies far too much on ethnic humor — mostly Jewish, but not entirely — to sit quite as comfortably as it might like... [Aldrich&#x27;s] professionalism serves the film well. It&#x27;s very hard to fault on a technical level, and he brings a strong visual sense to bear on a number of sequences that raise them several notches above the TV flavor of the material. The dance sequence, when Avram and his unlikely companion, Tommy (Harrison Ford), are prisoners of a tribe of Indians, is a good case in point, as is the final shoot-out in the streets of San Francisco... Never a great movie, it&#x27;s nonetheless a pleasant one — an old-fashioned entertainment that more than gets by on the unforced (albeit unlikely) chemistry of Wilder and Ford.&quot;

Puccio of Movie Metropolis called the film &quot;humorous and touching&quot; and &quot;uplifting as well&quot;: &quot;&quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; is not a great film; it&#x27;s not even a very good film by the best filmmaking standards; but it&#x27;s such a sweet and gentle film, it&#x27;s hard not to like... The film moseys along at a leisurely pace, and the director has a little difficulty finding the right comedic tone between dry, subtle farce and outright slapstick; yet it manages to find a soft spot in the heart for every scene, so maybe &#x27;heartwarming&#x27; is what Aldrich had in mind, in which case he couldn&#x27;t have done better.&quot;

Wilder&#x27;s performance was widely praised. Ebert wrote, &quot;What&#x27;s poignant about the film is that Wilder&#x27;s performance is such a nice one. He&#x27;s likable, plucky, versatile. He is, in fact, as good an actor here as he&#x27;s ever been before, and at his own brand of complex vulnerability Gene Wilder has never been surpassed.&quot; Hanke said, &quot;But the main interest in the film is probably Gene Wilder&#x27;s performance, which is interesting simply because it&#x27;s one of the few times that Wilder played a character that wasn&#x27;t essentially Gene Wilder. And, lo and behold, he does a perfectly credible job of being someone else — or at least someone else who isn&#x27;t Willy Wonka.&quot; Film scholar Stuart Galbraith IV declares that Wilder gives &quot;one of his very best performances&quot; and calls his character &quot;incredibly endearing&quot;: &quot;&quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; is a real surprise, offering as it does one of Gene Wilder&#x27;s best characterizations in a film that&#x27;s alternately funny and sweetly touching, this despite Robert Aldrich&#x27;s generally indelicate direction.&quot; Puccio wrote, &quot;Nobody does nice like Gene Wilder... Nor have many actors been so willing to celebrate their culture and religious convictions as Wilder does here, perhaps also a trait he picked up from [Mel] Brooks.&quot;

<text>Henry Glassford Bell (5 November 18037 January 1874) was a Scottish lawyer, poet and historian.

==Life==
Born in Glasgow, the son of advocate James Bell, he received his education at the Glasgow High School and at Edinburgh University.

As a poet, he became intimate with Delta Moir, James Hogg, John Wilson (Christopher North), and others on the staff of &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, to which he was drawn by his political sympathies. In 1828 he became editor of the &quot;Edinburgh Literary Journal&quot;, which was eventually incorporated in the &quot;Edinburgh Weekly Chronicle&quot;.

In 1831 he published &quot;Summer and Winter Hours&quot;, a volume of poems, of which the best known is that on Mary, Queen of Scots. He further defended the cause of the queen in a prose &quot;Life&quot; (2 vols, 1828–1831). Among his other works may be mentioned a preface which he wrote to Bell and Bains&#x27;s edition (1865) of the works of Shakespeare, and &quot;Romances and Minor Poems&quot; (1866). He figures in the society of the &quot;Noctes Ambrosianae&quot; as &quot;Tallboys.&quot;

He was a qualified advocate and was admitted to the bar in 1832. In 1839 he was appointed sheriff-substitute of Lanarkshire, and in 1867 succeeded Sir Archibald Alison to the post of sheriff of the county, an office which he filled with distinguished success until his death in 1874.

<text>David Macbeth Moir (5 January 17986 July 1851) was a Scottish physician and writer.

==Biography==

Moir was born at Musselburgh on 5 January 1798, the son of Elizabeth Macbeth (1767–1842) and Robert Moir (&quot;d&quot;. 1842). He was educated at Musselburgh Grammar School. At the age of 13 he was apprenticed to the medical practitioner Dr Stewart, studying with him for four years while also attending classes at the University of Edinburgh, from where he graduated in 1816.

In 1817 he entered into a partnership with Dr Brown, a Musselburgh doctor, practising there until his death. He was a contributor of both prose and verse to the magazines, and particularly, with the signature of Delta, to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. His life is featured in the book, &quot;The &quot;Blackwood&quot; Group&quot; by Sir George Douglas, Edinburgh: Oliphant, Anderson &amp; Ferrier, 1897. In 1846 he was elected a member of the Harveian Society of Edinburgh. 

A collection of his poetry was edited in 1852 by Thomas Aird. Among his publications were the famous &quot;Life of Mansie Wauch, Tailor&quot; (1828), which shows his gifts as a humorist, &quot;Outlines of the Ancient History of Medicine&quot; (1831), and &quot;Sketch of the Poetical Literature of the Past Half Century&quot; (1851).

He is one of several writers who are claimed as the author of the &quot;Canadian Boat-Song&quot;.

On 22 June 1851, while away from home, he was seriously injured when dismounting his horse. He died in on 6 July 1851 at Dumfries as a result of his injuries. He was buried on 10 July 1851 at Inveresk Church, Musselburgh.

He is commemorated by a memorial statue, which was erected in Musselburgh in 1853. There are also several street names in the town which make reference to him, and a branch of the pub chain Wetherspoons opened in February 2012 is named The David Macbeth Moir.

==Family==

In June 1829 he married Catherine Elizabeth Bell at Carham Church, Northumberland, and together they had 11 children. Their daughter Annie Marie Moir married Rev William Milligan and their children included the church historian Oswald Milligan and Rev. George Milligan.

<text>Lochboisdale ( ) is the main village and port on the island of South Uist, Outer Hebrides, Scotland. Lochboisdale is within the parish of South Uist, and is situated on the shore of Loch Baghasdail at the southern end of the A865.

==History==
The town profited from the herring boom in the 19th century, and a steamer pier was built in 1880. In 1905, a mission church was built, and by 1953, steamers were connecting Lochboisdale with Oban, Castlebay, Mallaig and Lochmaddy.

==Economy==
Lochboisdale is the ferry terminal for the island of South Uist, with regular vehicle ferry services to Mallaig and, in the winter, Oban. The pier area has undergone a transformation; the old shop and surrounding buildings were either renovated or removed to provide new housing and commercial units for rent.

Lochboisdale Hotel, built in the late 19th century as a fishing hotel, is adjacent to the ferry terminal.

The whole village is within walking distance of the pier, and has a post office with a coffee shop and internet café. A bank (RBS) branch is also present in the village and has a 24h ATM, although the branch itself is only open once a week. By the pier is an all-purpose store called Fàilte (meaning welcome in the local Gaelic language).

Lochboisdale Development Limited have recently opened a new harbour on the small island of Gasaigh. This is about from the village, and is reached by two causeways. The harbour provides many facilities. Mooring licences are available for day visiting, monthly and seasonal berths, with inclusive use of the quayside facilities, WiFi, showers and laundry.

==Trivia==
London-based restaurant chain Boisdale is named after Lochboisdale, having been founded in 1987 by Ranald Macdonald, the eldest son of the 24th Chief of Clanranald.
