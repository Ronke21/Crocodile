<text>Operation Sonnenblume (, &quot;Operation Sunflower&quot;) was the name given to the dispatch of German and Italian troops to North Africa in February 1941, during the Second World War. The Italian 10th Army () had been destroyed by the British, Commonwealth, Empire and Allied Western Desert Force attacks during Operation Compass The first units of the new (DAK), commanded by Erwin Rommel, departed Naples for Africa and arrived on 11 February 1941. (In the English-speaking world, the term became a generic term for German forces in North Africa.) On 14 February, advanced units of the 5th Light &quot;Afrika&quot; Division (later renamed the 21st Panzer Division), (Reconnaissance Battalion 3) and (Anti-tank Detachment 39) arrived at the Libyan port of Tripoli and were sent immediately to the front line east of Sirte.

Rommel arrived in Libya on 12 February, with orders to defend Tripoli and Tripolitania, albeit using aggressive tactics. General Italo Gariboldi replaced (Marshal of Italy) Rodolfo Graziani as the Governor-General of Libya on 25 March and Mario Roatta, Commander in Chief of the Royal Italian Army (&quot;Regio Esercito&quot;), ordered Graziani to place Italian motorised units in Libya under the new Italian–German command. The first German troops reached Sirte on 15 February, advanced to Nofilia on 18 February and a German raiding party ambushed a British patrol near El Agheila on 24 February. On 24 March, the Axis captured El Agheila and on 31 March attacked Mersa Brega. The understrength 3rd Armoured Brigade failed to counter-attack and began to retreat towards Benghazi the next day.

When the 3rd Armoured Brigade moved, its worn-out tanks began to break down, as had been predicted. The brigade failed to prevent Axis flanking moves in the desert south of the Cyrenaican bulge, which left Australian infantry in Benghazi no option but to retreat up the . Rommel split his forces into small columns to harry the British retreat as far the Axis fuel and water shortage permitted. A considerable British force was captured at Mechili, which led to the British retreat continuing to Tobruk and then on to the Libyan–Egyptian frontier. Axis forces failed to capture Tobruk in the first rush and Rommel then had to divide the Axis forces between Tobruk and the frontier.

 succeeded because the ability of the Germans to mount an offensive was underestimated by General Archibald Wavell, the Commander in Chief Middle East, the War Office and Winston Churchill. Rommel transformed the situation by his audacity, which was unexpected, despite copious intelligence reports from the decryption of signals from the German Enigma coding machine and MI14 (British Military Intelligence). Many experienced British units had been transferred to Greece in Operation Lustre and others to Egypt to refit. Some commanders appointed by Wavell to Cyrenaica Command (CYRCOM) failed to live up to expectations and Wavell relied on maps that were found to be inaccurate, when he later arrived to see for himself. In 1949, Wavell wrote, &quot;I had certainly not budgeted for Rommel after my experience of the Italians. I should have been more prudent...&quot;.
==Background==

===Italian invasion of Egypt===
 was the Italian invasion of Egypt in 1940 to seize the Suez Canal and which began the Western Desert Campaign (1940–1943). The Italians were opposed by British, Commonwealth, and Free French forces. After numerous delays, the scope of the offensive was reduced to an advance by the 10th Army (Marshal Rodolfo Graziani) into Egypt, as far as Sidi Barrani and attacks on any British forces in the area. The 10th Army advanced about into Egypt but only made contact with the British screening force from the 7th Armoured Division and did not engage the main force around Mersa Matruh. On 16 September, the 10th Army halted and took up defensive positions around the port of Sidi Barrani, intending to build fortified camps, while waiting for engineers to extend the () with the . Graziani intended to use the road to accumulate supplies for an advance on Mersa Matruh, about further east, where the remainder of the 7th Armoured Division and the 4th Indian Division were based.

===Operation Compass===


The British Western Desert Force (WDF, Lieutenant-General Sir Richard O&#x27;Connor) attacked the 10th Army in western Egypt and Cyrenaica, the eastern province of Libya from December 1940 to February 1941. The WDF, with about advanced from Mersa Matruh in Egypt for a five-day raid against the 10th Army. The Italian force had about in fortified posts around Sidi Barrani and further west, over the border in Cyrenaica. The 10th Army was swiftly defeated, Sidi Barrani and Sollum were re-captured, and the British continued the operation, attacking through Cyrenaica to capture Bardia, Tobruk, and Derna. The British then pursued the 10th Army along the around the Jebel Akhdar (Green Mountain) towards the western province of Tripolitania. Combe Force, an flying column, moved through the desert south of the Jebel and intercepted the last organised units of the 10th Army at the Battle of Beda Fomm. The WDF then chased the remnants of the 10th Army to El Agheila on the Gulf of Sidra. The British captured and Libyan prisoners, hundreds of tanks, and over and aircraft, while suffering only killed or wounded.

The British were unable to continue beyond El Agheila, due to supply difficulty and worn-out vehicles. In February 1941, the British War Cabinet decided to hold Cyrenaica with the minimum of forces and send the remainder to Greece. The most experienced, best-trained, and best-equipped units of the WDF were diverted to the Greek Campaign in Operation Lustre in March and April 1941. In Cyrenaica, the 6th Australian Division was up to strength but the vehicles of the 7th Armoured Division were worn out. The 2nd New Zealand Division had two brigades available and the 6th Infantry Division in Egypt had no artillery and was training for operations in the Dodecanese Islands. The 7th Australian Division (Major-General John Lavarack) and the 9th Australian Division were poorly-equipped and still training, a Polish Brigade Group was short of equipment and two armoured regiments, detached from the 2nd Armoured Division to the 7th Armoured Division, had also been worn out in the later stages of Operation Compass. The rest of the division had two cruiser tank regiments whose tanks had worn-out tracks and two light tank regiments; the divisional commander had died suddenly and been replaced by Major-General Michael Gambier-Parry.

====Siege of Giarabub====
The Siege of Giarabub (now Jaghbub), took place in the aftermath of the defeat of the 10th Army. The fortified Italian position at the Al Jaghbub Oasis was besieged by parts of the 6th Australian Division. The 6th Australian Divisional Cavalry Regiment began the siege in December 1940, leaving the Italian garrison dependent for supplies on the (the Italian Royal Air Force). Air transport proved insufficient and hunger prompted many of the locally recruited troops to desert. After being reinforced by the 2/9th Australian Battalion and a battery of the 4th Royal Horse Artillery, the Australians attacked on 17 March 1941 and forced the Italian garrison to surrender on 21 March.

===Terrain===

The war was fought primarily in the Western Desert, which was about wide, from Mersa Matruh in Egypt to Gazala on the Libyan coast, along , the only paved road. The Sand Sea inland marked the southern limit of the desert at its widest at Giarabub and Siwa; in British parlance, Western Desert came to mean eastern Cyrenaica too. From the coast, extending south lies a raised, flat plain of stony desert about above sea level, about from north to south, as far as the Sand Sea. Scorpions, vipers and flies populated the region, which was inhabited by a small number of Bedouin nomads.

Bedouin tracks like the Trigh el Abd and Trigh Capuzzo, linked wells and the easier traversed ground; navigation was by sun, star, compass and &quot;desert sense&quot;, good perception of the environment gained by experience. When Italian troops advanced into Egypt in September 1940, the Maletti Group left Sidi Omar and got lost, having to be found by reconnaissance aircraft. In spring and summer, the days are miserably hot and nights are very cold. The Sirocco (also known as or ), a hot desert wind, blows clouds of fine sand which reduces visibility to a few yards and coats eyes, lungs, machinery, food and equipment. Motor vehicles and aircraft need special oil filters. In such barren country, supplies for military operations have to be transported from outside. German engines, particularly motorcycles, tended to overheat and tank engine life fell from to , made worse by difficulties of maintaining diverse German and Italian motor types.

===Supply===
The normal sea route for Italian supplies to Libya went west round Sicily, then close to the coast to the port of Tripoli, to avoid interference from British aircraft, ships and submarines based at Malta; a third of the Italian merchant marine had been interned after Italy declared war and the diversion increased the voyage to about . On land, supplies had to be carried huge distances by road or in small consignments by coaster. After the Italian defeat in Operation Compass, Tripoli was the last remaining Axis port, with a maximum unloading capacity of four troopships or five cargo ships at once, enough for the delivery of about of freight per month. The distance from Tripoli to Benghazi was along the , which was only half-way to Alexandria.

The road could flood, was vulnerable to attacks by the Desert Air Force (DAF) and using desert tracks increased vehicle wear. A German motorised division needed of supplies per day and moving those supplies was calculated to need two-ton lorries on top of the divisions own vehicles. With seven Axis divisions, air and naval units, of supplies per month were needed. From February to May 1941, a surplus of was delivered from Italy. British attacks from Malta had some effect but in May, the worst month for shipping losses, 91 per cent of the supplies arrived. Lack of transport in Libya left German supplies stranded in Tripoli, while the Italians had only for deliveries to A record amount of supply arrived in June but at the front, shortages worsened.

==Prelude==

===German intervention===
German involvement in the western Mediterranean began with the arrival in Italy during June 1940, of , General Maximilian von Pohl), a liaison organisation to handle intelligence matters. air units arrived in Italy in October, to carry Italian troops to Albania and then on 15 November, 2 ( Albert Kesselring) transferred from Germany and ( Hans Geisler) moved from Norway to Sicily. By January 1941, X had bombers, bombers, forty twin-engined fighters, and twenty reconnaissance aircraft. X took over operations in southern Italy, Sicily, and part of Sardinia, and later took over in North Africa, with orders to secure the sea route from Italy to North Africa by neutralising Malta. Attacks were to be made on British supply routes to Egypt and Axis forces in North Africa were to be supported by the (General Stefan Fröhlich). The first sorties of the were flown on 7 January, against a British convoy and escorts off the Algerian coast.

On 24 October 1940, after an investigation of the possibility of military operations in North Africa, General Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma reported to Adolf Hitler that supply difficulties determined what could be achieved, given the North African climate and terrain, and British control of the Mediterranean. The minimum necessary force to capture Egypt was four divisions, which was also the maximum force which could be supplied from Italy, but Hitler refused to consider sending more than one armoured division. On 12 November, Hitler issued Directive 18, ordering that a panzer division be prepared to move to North Africa. Even this was cancelled after the Italian advance into Egypt in . After the magnitude of the Italian defeat during Operation Compass was realised, Hitler issued Directive 22 on 11 January 1941, ordering the dispatch of a (blocking detachment), initiating (Operation Sunflower). On 3 February, Hitler agreed to send another panzer division to join the 5th Light &quot;Afrika&quot; Division ( Johann von Ravenstein). The first German troops reached Libya on 14 February and the first tanks on 20 February. A panzer corps of two divisions had been recommended by General Hans von Funck after a visit to Libya in January, and by General Enno von Rintelen, the senior military attaché in Rome; Hitler agreed only to send another panzer regiment. Other elements of the 15th Panzer Division ( Maximilian von Herff) began to arrive in late April.

On 19 February, the (DAK), was formed as a (barrier detachment) to defend Tripolitania. After the Battle of France 1940), the (German army) began bolting extra plates to its tanks and most of those in Panzer Regiment 5 and Panzer Regiment 8 were of the modified type. The tanks were also adapted for desert conditions, with better engine cooling achieved by increasing the speed of the radiator fan and by cutting holes in the hatch covers of the engine compartment. Panzer Regiment 5 of the 5th Light Division arrived in North Africa aboard two convoys from 1941.

The regiment had three (small command vehicles) and four (command vehicles). Another 25 Panzer I to reinforce the regiment arrived in Tripoli on 10 May. The tanks in Panzer Regiment 5 were still painted dark grey () and carried the 3rd Panzer Division emblem of an inverted Y with two strikes. On 18 January, Panzer Regiment 8 with part of the 10th Panzer Division was transferred to the new 15th Panzer Division, which had been created from the 33rd Infantry Division. Panzer Regiment 8 was shipped to Libya in three convoys from 1941 and by 28 May, had completed its assembly in North Africa.

===Axis command===

After General Giuseppe Tellera was killed on 7 February at the Battle of Beda Fomm, General Italo Gariboldi took over command of the remnants of the 10th Army and on 25 March, replaced Graziani as the Governor-General of Libya. Erwin Rommel was promoted to , appointed to command the DAK and arrived in Libya on 12 February. Rommel had been ordered in January by the Commander in Chief of the German army, Walther von Brauchitsch, to defend Tripoli and Tripolitania, albeit using aggressive tactics. The Commander in Chief of the and head of (Italian army high command) Mario Roatta, put Rommel under the command of Gariboldi and ordered Gariboldi to put all Italian motorised units under the tactical command of Rommel. Rommel sent XX Corps with the 27th Infantry Division &quot;Brescia&quot; (Brescia Division), 17th Infantry Division &quot;Pavia&quot; (Pavia Division) and the last 60 tanks of the 132nd Armoured Division &quot;Ariete&quot; (Ariete Division) forward. Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) the supreme command of the German armed forces was intend only on stabilising the military situation in Africa. On a visit to Berlin, Rommel was told not to expect reinforcements, even after the limited advance from Tripoli, along the Gulf of Sirte to Sirte and then another on to Nofilia on 19 March.

===CYRCOM===
The 9th Australian Division and the 2nd Armoured Division (minus a brigade group sent to Greece), were left to garrison Cyrenaica under Cyrenaica Command (Lieutenant-General Henry Maitland Wilson), despite the inadequacy of the force if the Germans sent troops to Libya. Command in Egypt was taken over by Lieutenant-General Richard O&#x27;Connor and the XIII Corps HQ was replaced by the HQ of the 1st Australian Corps (Lieutenant-General Thomas Blamey). It was believed by General Archibald Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief Middle East and GHQ in Egypt, that the Germans could not be ready until May, by when the 2nd Armoured Division tanks would have been overhauled, two more divisions and support troops, particularly artillery, would be ready, along with the 9th Australian Division. The 2nd Armoured Division had a reconnaissance regiment; the 3rd Armoured Brigade had an understrength light tank regiment and one equipped with captured Fiat M13/40 tanks. The cruiser regiment arrived in late March, after many breakdowns en route, which brought the division up to an understrength armoured brigade. Two brigades of the 9th Australian Division were swapped with two from the 7th Australian Division, which were less well trained and were short of equipment and transport.

Attempts by the British to re-open Benghazi were frustrated by lack of transport, poor weather and the which began bombing and mining of the harbour in early February. The attacks led the British to abandon attempts to use it to receive supplies and to evacuate the Italian stores and equipment captured during Operation Compass. Lack of transport made it impossible to supply a garrison west of El Agheila, the most favourable position for a defensive line and restricted the 2nd Armoured Division to movement between supply dumps, reducing its limited mobility further. In February, Lieutenant-General Philip Neame took over CYRCOM and predicted that many of the tanks would break down as soon as they moved. (Neame also discovered that he had to rely on the local telephone system, staffed by Italian operators.) Neame wanted a proper armoured division, two infantry divisions and adequate air support to hold the area. Wavell replied that there was little to be sent and nothing before April. In early March, the 9th Australian Division began to relieve the 6th Australian Division at Mersa Brega for Operation Lustre, which demonstrated the difficulty of tactical moves with insufficient transport. On 20 March, the Australians were withdrawn north of Benghazi to Tocra, near Er Regima for ease of supply and the 2nd Armoured Division took over.
There were no easily defended positions between El Agheila and Benghazi, the terrain being open and good tank country. Neame was ordered to conserve the tank units as far as possible, yet inflict losses on the Axis forces if they attacked, fight a delaying action as far as Benghazi if pressed and abandon the port if necessary. There was no prospect of reinforcement before May so the high ground of the escarpment nearby and the defiles to the north near Er Regima and Barce in the Jebel Akhdar, were to be held for as long as possible. The 2nd Armoured Division would move inland south of the Jebel to Antelat and operate against the flank and rear of the Axis forces, when they moved up the coast road () or cut across the desert towards Mechili and Tobruk. The tanks would have to use depots at Msus, Tecnis, Martuba, Mechili, Timimi, El Magrun and Benghazi as a substitute for lorry-borne supply. The 3rd Indian Motor Brigade (Brigadier Edward Vaughan) arrived at Martuba in late March with its transport but no tanks, artillery, anti-tank guns and only half its wireless sets, to be ready to move towards Derna, Barce or Mechili if the Axis attacked.

==Battle==

===24 March – 2 April===

On 24 March, Rommel advanced with the new towards the positions of the British 3rd Armoured Brigade, south-east of Mersa Brega, where the 2nd Support Group held an front; the Australians were to the north, minus a brigade left at Tobruk, deficient in much equipment and out of contact with the 2nd Armoured Division. British air reconnaissance had observed German troops west of El Agheila on 25 February and by 5 March, it was expected that the German commander would consolidate the defence of Tripolitania, try to recapture Cyrenaica and then invade Egypt. The Germans were expected to use Sirte and Nofilia as bases but not before April; Rommel was identified on 8 March but local intelligence was hard to find. The mileage restrictions necessary to maintain the few troops and vehicles near the front and the danger from fast German (eight-wheeler armoured cars) inhibited British reconnaissance units, whose armoured cars were slower and had inferior armament.

On 1 April, Rommel sent two columns to capture Mersa Brega, with Panzer Regiment 5, Machine-Gun Battalion 8, Reconnaissance Unit 3 and anti-tank guns and artillery moving along the as Machine-Gun Battalion 2 and some anti-tank guns made an outflanking move through the desert to the south. The British withdrew from Mersa Brega, followed up by the Germans as the Ariete Division and the Brescia Division advanced from Tripoli. The 5th Light Division was ordered on to Ajdabiya (Agedabia) and the harbour of Zuetina, despite Italian objections. Air reconnaissance on 3 April, revealed that the British were still retiring and Rommel ordered a probe around the southern flank by an Italian detachment and several German platoons were sent under Lieutenant-Colonel Gerhard von Schwerin towards Maaten el Grara, from where they were to observe the ground towards Msus, south-east of Benghazi and Ben Gania further south. Reconnaissance Unit 3 was ordered to reconnoitre towards Soluch and Ghemines; during the evening Rommel ordered them on to Benghazi.

===3–5 April===

On 3 April, Gambier-Parry had received a report that a large enemy armoured force was advancing on Msus (now Zawiyat Masus in the Fati Municipality), site of the main divisional supply dump. The 3rd Armoured Brigade (Brigadier Reginald Rimington) moved there and found that the petrol had been destroyed to prevent capture. The tank brigade had already been reduced by losses and breakdowns to and Neame received conflicting reports about the positions of the British and Axis forces and on 5 April, reports that a large Axis force was advancing on El Abiar, led him to order the 9th Australian Division back to Wadi Cuff north-east of Benghazi and the elements of the 2nd Armoured Division to guard the desert flank and retire on Mechili. Conflicting reports led Neame to countermand these orders, which caused the Australians much confusion. On 6 April, British air reconnaissance reported that there were Axis columns in the desert and the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade repulsed an attack at Mechili, which led to O&#x27;Connor at the CYRCOM headquarters (Neame had left to visit Gambier-Parry), to order a general withdrawal.

The headquarters of the 2nd Armoured Division and the 2nd Support Group were ordered back to Mechili followed by the 3rd Armoured Brigade. Rimington decided that the armoured brigade lacked the fuel to reach Mechili and ordered a move to Maraura, where a small amount of petrol was found. Rimington planned to move to Derna via Giovanni Berta to obtain more fuel; Rimington was captured with his deputy when he motored ahead. The brigade continued on and crowded the Australians, who were bypassing Derna, as they withdrew to Gazala. The Australians had collected every vehicle that could move and withdrawn at behind extensive demolitions, covered by the 1st Battalion King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (1st KRRC), a motor battalion recently arrived from Egypt. (The 2/13th Australian Battalion was rushed to Martuba to block the track from Mechili and the first units of the division reached Tmimi by on 7 April, where the 26th Australian Brigade held the town, until the division and stragglers from other units passed through.)
The 5th Light Division, between Agedabia and Zuetina, reported that it needed four days to refuel but Rommel ordered that every supply vehicle be unloaded and along with spare fighting vehicles, sent back west of El Agheila, to collect fuel within 24 hours, while the rest of the division waited. Despite more objections from Gariboldi, Rommel decided that the advance must go faster if the British were to be trapped. On the night of Reconnaissance Unit 3 entered Benghazi and that morning Rommel ordered it to continue to Mechili, as soon as the Brescia Division arrived. As units reached Benghazi, Rommel formed them into columns, Group Schwerin was sent to Tmimi and Group Fabris, composed of motorcyclists and the Ariete divisional artillery, to Mechili followed by the rest of the Ariete Division. General Streich, the 5th Light Division commander, was ordered on to Tobruk with Machine-Gun Battalion 8, part of Panzer Regiment 5 and an anti-tank company. Lieutenant-Colonel Olbrich, the Panzer Regiment 5 commander, was sent with Machine-Gun Battalion 2, artillery and an armoured battalion of the Ariete Division, via Msus to Mechili or on to Tmimi and Major-General Heinrich Kirchheim, who was in the area by coincidence, was shanghaied and ordered to advance with two columns along the and through the Jebel Akhdar with the Brescia Division.

By late on 4 April, Group Schwerin was out of fuel and stranded near Ben Gania, with the Italian contingents trailing behind and Group Streich had got only as far as Maaten el Grara; next day a party from Group Streich reached Tengeder with the rest straggling behind for . Reconnaissance Unit 3 was stopped by the 2nd Support Group artillery west of Charruba and Group Olbrich reached Antelat, with a machine-gun unit having pressed on to the east of Sceleidima; Group Kirchheim had a column at Driana and the other at Er Regima. Air reconnaissance on 5 April, showed that the British were still retreating; Rommel ordered the Axis columns to meet at Mechili. Group Fabris and the Ariete Division were stalled between Ben Gania and Tengeder, south of Mechili and in the evening Rommel detached Machine-gun Battalion 8 (Lieutenant-Colonel Gustav Ponath) from Group Streich and led it to Mechili, where the advanced units of Group Schwerin arrived early on 6 April. Ponath was sent on towards Derna with a small party, by which time Group Kirchheim had one column near Maddalena and the other east of El Abiar. Reconnaissance Unit 3 had hardly moved and Group Olbrich had run out of fuel again. Ponath reached the coast road and advanced on the airfield south of Derna early on 7 April.

===6–8 April===

Kirchheim sent the non-mechanised parts of the Pavia Division (General Pietro Zaglio) and the Brescia Division along the and the mechanised and motorised units through the Jebel Akhdar. On 6 April, the Ariete Division reached Mechili and at noon, Ponath re-assembled his group near Derna airfield and cut one of the British withdrawal routes. The 5th Royal Tank Regiment (Lieutenant-Colonel H. D. Drew), repulsed two determined attacks and then counter-attacked with the last four British tanks. The rest of the British disengaged before the tanks were knocked out and the road was left open for stragglers in Derna. Neame had ordered CYRCOM headquarters to move back to Tmimi, west of Tobruk, where the Chief of Staff, Brigadier John Harding arrived early on 7 April, to find no sign of Neame or O&#x27;Connor. Harding ordered CYRCOM to move into Tobruk and reported his fears to Wavell in Egypt. During the withdrawal, Neame, O&#x27;Connor and Brigadier Combe had left Maraua at and taken a desert track at Giovanni Berta but then took a wrong turning north towards Derna, instead of east to Tmimi and ran into Group Ponath near Martuba.

Rommel had intended to attack Mechili on 7 April but the Axis forces were scattered, short of fuel and tired. Group Fabris moved forward during the morning but the Ariete Division and Group Streich took all day to arrive, having been attacked by the RAF; A Squadron of the Long Range Desert Group had appeared from the south, to harass Axis movements. By nightfall on 7 April, the 9th Australian Division (less the 24th Australian Infantry Brigade) with the 2nd Support Group had blocked the at Acroma, about west of Tobruk, where the 18th and 24th Australian Infantry brigades were preparing the defences. (The 18th Australian Infantry Brigade had arrived from Egypt by sea after the dispatch of the 7th Australian Division to Greece had been cancelled.) A small force held El Adem, south of Tobruk to observe the approaches from the south and south-west and at Mechili, Gambier-Parry had the 2nd Armoured Division headquarters soft-skinned vehicles and a cruiser tank, most of the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade, M Battery 1st Royal Horse Artillery, part of the 2/3rd Australian Anti-tank Regiment and elements of other units.

The Germans tried twice to bluff Gambier-Parry into surrender but he had received orders from CYRCOM to break out and retreat to El Adem, Gambier-Parry decided to attack at dawn, to gain a measure of surprise. On 8 April, A Squadron of the 18th Cavalry broke through and then turned to attack Italian artillery, as some Indian troops of the 11th Prince Albert Victor&#x27;s Own Cavalry (Frontier Force) got away. Most of the garrison was pinned down but during a second attempt at small parties of the 2nd Royal Lancers escaped. The garrison had fired most of its small arms ammunition at the vision slits of the German tanks, which had hung back in fear of mines and when Italian infantry attacked, had little ammunition left. Gambier-Parry and Indian and Australian troops surrendered to Major-General Pietro Zaglio, commander of the Pavia Division.

===Tobruk===
By 8 April, the most advanced German units had arrived at Derna but some units which had cut across the chord of the Jebel, ran out of water and fuel at Tengeder. Prittwitz, the commander of the 15th Panzer Division was sent ahead with a column of reconnaissance, anti-tank, machine-gun and artillery units, to block the eastern exit from Tobruk, as the 5th Light Division moved from the south-west and the Brescia Division advanced from the west. Rommel hoped to pursue CYRCOM across Egypt and take Alexandria but overstretched supply lines, opposition from OKW and the British defence of Tobruk made this impossible.

On 10 April, Rommel made the Suez Canal the objective of the DAK and ordered that a breakout from Tobruk was to be prevented. Next day the port was invested but the rush ended with the 5th Light Division on the east side, Group Prittwitz to the south (Prittwitz having been killed) and the Brescia Division to the west. Reconnaissance Unit 3 went on to Bardia and a composite force was sent on to Sollum to try to reach Mersa Matruh but was prevented by the British Mobile Force (Brigadier William Gott) on the frontier, which conducted a delaying action around Sollum and Capuzzo. Tobruk was defended by a force of about and Australian troops, well stocked with supplies and linked to Egypt by the Navy. The garrison had armoured cars and captured Italian tanks, which could raid Axis supply convoys as they passed Tobruk for the frontier and made impossible an Axis invasion of Egypt.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

In 1956, I. S. O. Playfair, the British official historian, wrote that British assumptions about the time needed for an Axis counter-offensive were not unrealistic but were confounded by the boldness of Rommel and the fact that the 3rd Armoured Brigade was a brigade in name only, no tanks were available for the re-equipping of the brigade or the two in the 7th Armoured Division back in Egypt. When the DAK attacked there was no armoured force capable of counter-attacking or cutting Axis communications. By the time the British had retreated into the Jebel Akhdar, the infantry lacked mobility, the tanks of the 3rd Armoured Brigade had fallen to pieces and the only reserve was a motor brigade without tanks, artillery and anti-tank guns. For as long as the Axis forces had the fuel to manoeuvre, the British had no defence against outflanking attacks to the south. The retreat to Tobruk succeeded but the first Italo-German offensive had been an operational success and a &quot;triumph for Rommel&quot;.

The and had little influence on operations, despite the disadvantages faced by the DAF during the retreat. The was not under army authority and chose the objectives of the air forces. Many strafing attacks were made on parties of British troops and vehicles but these were not concentrated on bottlenecks, despite the few routes of retreat round the Cyrenaican bulge and south of the Jebel Akhdar. The DAF had been depleted to provide squadrons for Greece and had only two fighter and one bomber squadron until 8 April when another bomber squadron arrived. The fighter squadrons had to resort to wasteful standing patrols over important areas and were able occasionally to give cover to traffic jams but were unable to prevent air attacks on two petrol convoys, which were destroyed. The British lacked the aircraft to keep air superiority and the Axis air forces made no consistent attempt to seize it, leading to the influence of both sides being sporadic.

Supply constraints had made it impossible for the Axis to advance much beyond the frontier wire on the Libyan–Egyptian border by mid-April. As long as the port of Tobruk was held by the British, the Axis position on the border was unstable, as the Italo-Germans were distracted by the siege, while the British could rebuild their strength in Egypt. The British Mobile Force columns based at Halfaya, Sofafi, Buq Buq and Sidi Barrani began to harass the Germans in the area around Capuzzo and Sollum and after an ambush near Sidi Azeiz, the local German commander sent an alarmist report to Rommel, leading to an attack by Group Herff from that pushed the British back to Buq Buq and Sofafi but the April attacks on Tobruk were costly failures.

Cooper wrote in 1978, that Tobruk had been invested on 11 April, after a twelve-day advance. German tanks had proved superior to their British counterparts but the Axis could not maintain a force further east than Sollum, without Tobruk. German forces probed the Tobruk defences from attacked from and again from On 2 May, Rommel accepted that the Axis force was not sufficient to capture Tobruk. Preparations would have to be made to repel a British counter-attack from Egypt, the chronic lack of fuel determining movement more than tactics. (Italian armed forces high command) wanted a pause before advancing into Egypt, as did Hitler, who also considered the capture of Tobruk to be essential; Rommel demanded more aircraft to carry ammunition, fuel and water forward. General Friedrich Paulus, a deputy Chief of the General Staff, was sent to Africa to report on the situation. The British received through Ultra a decrypt of the Paulus report but the &quot;considerable intelligence coup&quot; was mishandled, encouraging the premature attack of Operation Brevity.

In 1993, Harold Raugh wrote that the diversion of so many British units to Greece was the main reason for the success of , along with the transfer of units to Egypt to refit, the appointment by Wavell of incompetent commanders and his failure properly to study the terrain. The potential of the Germans to mount an offensive was underestimated and the capability, audacity and potential Rommel had to transform the situation was overlooked by Wavell, the War Office and Winston Churchill, despite copious intelligence reports from Ultra and MI 14 (British Military Intelligence). In 1949, Wavell wrote that he had taken an unwarranted risk in Cyrenaica, having formed expectations of the Axis based on the experience of fighting the Italian army; &quot;I had certainly not budgeted for Rommel after my experience of the Italians. I should have been more prudent...&quot;

===Casualties===
The British lost when much of the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade was forced to surrender at Mechili on 8 April. Lieutenant-generals Philip Neame and Richard O&#x27;Connor, Richard Gambier-Parry, the 2nd Armoured Division commander, Brigadier Reginald Rimington and Lieutenant-Colonel John Combe were captured. From the 3rd Armoured Brigade lost most of its tanks to mechanical breakdown, fuel shortage and demolitions to prevent them being captured. About twenty tanks had been returned earlier to Tobruk for repairs and another three unserviceable tanks were salvaged during the retreat; tanks were knocked out but many were recovered later and repaired.

===Subsequent operations===

====Siege of Tobruk====


From 11 to 12 April, Panzer Regiment 5 probed the defences of the 20th Australian Brigade near the El Adem road and was repulsed by artillery fire; German infantry who reached the anti-tank ditch were forced back by Australian infantry. The Germans were surprised, having assumed that the shipping at Tobruk was there to evacuate the garrison and planned an attack by the 5th Light Division for the night of Groups of Axis vehicles were attacked by 45 Squadron and 55 Squadron RAF, which rearmed at the airfields inside the perimeter. The attack began with an attempt to get over the anti-tank ditch west of the El Adem road, in the 2/17th Australian Battalion sector and was repulsed. Another attempt was made later and by dawn a small bridgehead had been established; Panzer Regiment 5 drove through and turned northwards, ready to divide into one column for the harbour and one to move west and cut off the garrison but the advance was stopped. The Italians had been slow to provide blueprints for the port fortifications and after three weeks, Rommel suspended the attacks and resumed the siege. Italian infantry divisions took up positions about the fortress, while the bulk of the DAK maintained a mobile position south and east of the port, keeping the frontier in easy reach.

====Operation Brevity====

Operation Brevity was a limited British offensive, planned as a rapid blow against the weak Axis front-line forces around Sollum, Fort Capuzzo and Bardia on the Egyptian–Libyan frontier. The British had received an Ultra intercept of the report compiled by Paulus, which dwelt on the exhaustion and the dire supply situation facing the Axis at Tobruk and the frontier, which encouraged a premature attempt to inflict losses on the Axis frontier garrisons and to capture jumping-off places for a later attack towards Tobruk. The garrison of Tobruk, to the west, had resisted Axis attacks and its Australian and British troops could still endanger the Axis supply line from Tripoli, which led Rommel to give priority to the siege, leaving the front line thinly held. On 15 May, Gott attacked with a mixed infantry and armoured force in three columns.

Halfaya Pass was taken against determined Italian opposition and in Libya, the British captured Fort Capuzzo but German counter-attacks regained the fort during the afternoon, inflicting a costly defeat on the defenders. The operation had begun well and had thrown the Axis commanders into confusion but most of its early gains were lost to counter-attacks and with German reinforcements arriving from Tobruk, the operation was called off. Gott became concerned that his forces risked being caught in the open by German tanks and conducted a staged withdrawal to the Halfaya Pass on 16 May. From 26 to 27 May, German troops recaptured the pass in Operation Skorpion. The British resumed preparations for Operation Battleaxe which began on 15 June.

<doc id="381937" wikidata="Q1424540" url="?curid=381937" title="Tabu search">
<text>Tabu search (TS) is a metaheuristic search method employing local search methods used for mathematical optimization. It was created by Fred W. Glover in 1986 and formalized in 1989. 

Local (neighborhood) searches take a potential solution to a problem and check its immediate neighbors (that is, solutions that are similar except for very few minor details) in the hope of finding an improved solution. Local search methods have a tendency to become stuck in suboptimal regions or on plateaus where many solutions are equally fit.

Tabu search enhances the performance of local search by relaxing its basic rule. First, at each step &quot;worsening&quot; moves can be accepted if no improving move is available (like when the search is stuck at a strict local minimum). In addition, &quot;prohibitions&quot; (hence the term &quot;tabu&quot;) are introduced to discourage the search from coming back to previously-visited solutions.

The implementation of tabu search uses memory structures that describe the visited solutions or user-provided sets of rules. If a potential solution has been previously visited within a certain short-term period or if it has violated a rule, it is marked as &quot;tabu&quot; (forbidden) so that the algorithm does not consider that possibility repeatedly.

==Background==

The word &quot;tabu&quot; comes from the Tongan word to indicate things that cannot be touched because they are sacred.

Tabu search is a metaheuristic algorithm that can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems (problems where an optimal ordering and selection of options is desired).

Current applications of TS span the areas of resource planning, telecommunications, VLSI design, financial analysis, scheduling, space planning, energy distribution, molecular engineering, logistics, pattern classification, flexible manufacturing, waste management, mineral exploration, biomedical analysis, environmental conservation and scores of others. In recent years, journals in a wide variety of fields have published tutorial articles and computational studies documenting successes by tabu search in extending the frontier of problems that can be handled effectively — yielding solutions whose quality often significantly surpasses that obtained by methods previously applied. A comprehensive list of applications, including summary descriptions of gains achieved from practical implementations, can be found in 

==Basic description==

Tabu search uses a local or neighborhood search procedure to iteratively move from one potential solution formula_1 to an improved solution formula_2 in the neighborhood of formula_1, until some stopping criterion has been satisfied (generally, an attempt limit or a score threshold). Local search procedures often become stuck in poor-scoring areas or areas where scores plateau. In order to avoid these pitfalls and explore regions of the search space that would be left unexplored by other local search procedures, tabu search carefully explores the neighborhood of each solution as the search progresses. The solutions admitted to the new neighborhood, formula_4, are determined through the use of memory structures. Using these memory structures, the search progresses by iteratively moving from the current solution formula_1 to an improved solution formula_2 in formula_4. 

Tabu search has several similarities with simulated annealing, as both involve possible downhill moves. In fact, simulated annealing could be viewed as a special form of TS, whereby we use &quot;graduated tenure&quot;, that is, a move becomes tabu with a specified probability.

These memory structures form what is known as the tabu list, a set of rules and banned solutions used to filter which solutions will be admitted to the neighborhood formula_4 to be explored by the search. In its simplest form, a tabu list is a short-term set of the solutions that have been visited in the recent past (less than formula_9 iterations ago, where formula_9 is the number of previous solutions to be stored — is also called the tabu tenure). More commonly, a tabu list consists of solutions that have changed by the process of moving from one solution to another. It is convenient, for ease of description, to understand a “solution” to be coded and represented by such attributes.

==Types of memory==
The memory structures used in tabu search can roughly be divided into three categories:
* Short-term: The list of solutions recently considered. If a potential solution appears on the tabu list, it cannot be revisited until it reaches an expiration point.
* Intermediate-term: Intensification rules intended to bias the search towards promising areas of the search space.
* Long-term: Diversification rules that drive the search into new regions (i.e., regarding resets when the search becomes stuck in a plateau or a suboptimal dead-end).

Short-term, intermediate-term and long-term memories can overlap in practice. Within these categories, memory can further be differentiated by measures such as frequency and impact of changes made. One example of an intermediate-term memory structure is one that prohibits or encourages solutions that contain certain attributes (e.g., solutions that include undesirable or desirable values for certain variables) or a memory structure that prevents or induces certain moves (e.g. based on frequency memory applied to solutions sharing features in common with unattractive or attractive solutions found in the past). In short-term memory, selected attributes in solutions recently visited are labelled &quot;tabu-active.&quot; Solutions that contain tabu-active elements are banned. Aspiration criteria are employed to override a solution&#x27;s tabu state, thereby including the otherwise-excluded solution in the allowed set (provided the solution is “good enough” according to a measure of quality or diversity). A simple and commonly used aspiration criterion is to allow solutions which are better than the currently-known best solution.

Short-term memory alone may be enough to achieve solutions superior to those found by conventional local search methods, but intermediate and long-term structures are often necessary for solving harder problems. Tabu search is often benchmarked against other metaheuristic methods — such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization algorithms, reactive search optimization, guided local search, or greedy randomized adaptive search. In addition, tabu search is sometimes combined with other metaheuristics to create hybrid methods. The most common tabu search hybrid arises by joining TS with scatter search, a class of population-based procedures which has roots in common with tabu search, and is often employed in solving large non-linear optimization problems.

== Pseudocode ==

The following pseudocode presents a simplified version of the tabu search algorithm as described above. This implementation has a rudimentary short-term memory, but contains no intermediate or long-term memory structures. The term &quot;fitness&quot; refers to an evaluation of the candidate solution, as embodied in an objective function for mathematical optimization.
sBest ← s0
bestCandidate ← s0
tabuList ← []
tabuList.push(s0)
while (not stoppingCondition())
 sNeighborhood ← getNeighbors(bestCandidate)
 bestCandidateFitness ← -∞
 for (sCandidate in sNeighborhood)
 if ( (not tabuList.contains(sCandidate)) 
 and (fitness(sCandidate) &gt; bestCandidateFitness) )
 bestCandidate ← sCandidate
 bestCandidateFitness ← fitness(bestCandidate)
 end
 end
 if (bestCandidateFitness is -∞)
 break;
 end
 if (bestCandidateFitness &gt; fitness(sBest))
 sBest ← bestCandidate
 end
 tabuList.push(bestCandidate)
 if (tabuList.size &gt; maxTabuSize)
 tabuList.removeFirst()
 end
end
return sBest
Lines 1–4 represent some initial setup, respectively creating an initial solution (possibly chosen at random), setting that initial solution as the best seen to date, and initializing a tabu list with this initial solution. In this example, the tabu list is simply a short term memory structure that will contain a record of the elements of the states visited.

The core algorithmic loop starts in line 5. This loop will continue searching for an optimal solution until a user-specified stopping condition is met (two examples of such conditions are a simple time limit or a threshold on the fitness score). The neighboring solutions are checked for tabu elements in line 9. Additionally, the algorithm keeps track of the best solution in the neighbourhood, that is not tabu.

The fitness function is generally a mathematical function, which returns a score or the aspiration criteria are satisfied — for example, an aspiration criterion could be considered as a new search space is found. If the best local candidate has a higher fitness value than the current best (line 18), it is set as the new best (line 19). The local best candidate is always added to the tabu list (line 21), and if the tabu list is full (line 22), some elements will be allowed to expire (line 23). Generally, elements expire from the list in the same order they are added. The procedure will select the best local candidate (even if it has worse fitness than the current best) in order to escape the local optimal.

This process continues until the user specified stopping criterion is met, at which point the best solution seen during the search process is returned (line 26).

==Example: the traveling salesman problem==

The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is sometimes used to show the functionality of tabu search. This problem poses a straightforward question: given a list of cities, what is the shortest route that visits every city? For example, if city A and city B are next to each other, while city C is farther away, the total distance traveled will be shorter if cities A and B are visited one after the other before visiting city C. Since finding an optimal solution is NP-hard, heuristic-based approximation methods (such as local searches) are useful for devising close-to-optimal solutions. To obtain good TSP solutions, it is essential to exploit the graph structure. The value of exploiting problem structure is a recurring theme in metaheuristic methods, and tabu search is well-suited to this. A class of strategies associated with tabu search called ejection chain methods has made it possible to obtain high-quality TSP solutions efficiently 

On the other hand, a simple tabu search can be used to find a satisficing solution for the traveling salesman problem (that is, a solution that satisfies an adequacy criterion, although not with the high quality obtained by exploiting the graph structure). The search starts with an initial solution, which can be generated randomly or according to some sort of nearest neighbor algorithm. To create new solutions, the order that two cities are visited in a potential solution is swapped. The total traveling distance between all the cities is used to judge how ideal one solution is compared to another. To prevent cycles – i.e., repeatedly visiting a particular set of solutions – and to avoid becoming stuck in local optima, a solution is added to the tabu list if it is accepted into the solution neighborhood, formula_4.

New solutions are created until some stopping criterion, such as an arbitrary number of iterations, is met. Once the simple tabu search stops, it returns the best solution found during its execution.

<text>In computer programming, a block or code block or block of code is a lexical structure of source code which is grouped together. Blocks consist of one or more declarations and statements. A programming language that permits the creation of blocks, including blocks nested within other blocks, is called a block-structured programming language. Blocks are fundamental to structured programming, where control structures are formed from blocks.

Blocks have two functions: to group statements so that they can be treated as one statement, and to define scopes for names to distinguish them from the same name used elsewhere. In a block-structured programming language, the objects named in outer blocks are visible inside inner blocks, unless they are masked by an object declared with the same name.

==History==
Ideas of block structure were developed in the 1950s during the development of the first autocodes, and were formalized in the Algol 58 and Algol 60 reports. Algol 58 introduced the notion of the &quot;compound statement&quot;, which was related solely to control flow. The subsequent &quot;Revised Report&quot; which described the syntax and semantics of Algol 60 introduced the notion of a block and block scope, with a block consisting of &quot; A sequence of declarations followed by a sequence of statements and enclosed between begin and end...&quot; in which &quot;[e]very declaration appears in a block in this way and is valid only for that block.&quot;

==Syntax==
Blocks use different syntax in different languages. Two broad families are:

* the ALGOL family in which blocks are delimited by the keywords &quot;codice_1&quot; and &quot;codice_2&quot; or equivalent. In C, blocks are delimited by curly braces - &quot;codice_3&quot; and &quot;codice_4&quot;. ALGOL 68 uses parentheses.
* Parentheses - &quot;codice_5&quot; and &quot;codice_6&quot;, are used in the MS-DOS batch language
* indentation, as in Python
* s-expressions with a syntactic keyword such as codice_7 or codice_8 (as in the Lisp family)
* In 1968 (with ALGOL 68), then in Edsger W. Dijkstra&#x27;s 1974 Guarded Command Language the conditional and iterative code block are alternatively terminated with the block reserved word &quot;reversed&quot;: e.g. codice_9, codice_10 and codice_11

==Limitations==
Some languages which support blocks with declarations do not fully support all declarations; for instance many C-derived languages do not permit a function definition within a block (nested functions). And unlike its ancestor Algol, Pascal does not support the use of blocks with their own declarations inside the begin and end of an existing block, only compound statements enabling sequences of statements to be grouped together in if, while, repeat and other control statements.

==Basic semantics==
The semantic meaning of a block is twofold. Firstly, it provides the programmer with a way for creating arbitrarily large and complex structures that can be treated as units. Secondly, it enables the programmer to limit the scope of variables and sometimes other objects that have been declared.

In early languages such as Fortran IV and BASIC, there were no statement blocks or control structures other than simple forms of loops. Conditionals were implemented using conditional goto statements:
C LANGUAGE: ANSI STANDARD FORTRAN 66
C INITIALIZE VALUES TO BE CALCULATED
 PAYSTX = .FALSE.
 PAYSST = .FALSE.
 TAX = 0.0
 SUPTAX = 0.0
C SKIP TAX DEDUCTION IF EMPLOYEE EARNS LESS THAN TAX THRESHOLD
 IF (WAGES .LE. TAXTHR) GOTO 100
 PAYSTX = .TRUE.
 TAX = (WAGES - TAXTHR) * BASCRT
C SKIP SUPERTAX DEDUCTION IF EMPLOYEE EARNS LESS THAN SUPERTAX THRESHOLD
 IF (WAGES .LE. SUPTHR) GOTO 100
 PAYSST = .TRUE.
 SUPTAX = (WAGES - SUPTHR) * SUPRAT
 100 TAXED = WAGES - TAX - SUPTAX
The logical structure of the program is not reflected in the language, and analyzing when a given statement is executed can be difficult.

Blocks allow the programmer to treat a group of statements as a unit, and the default values which had to appear in initialization in this style of programming can, with a block structure, be placed closer to the decision:
 { Language: Jensen and Wirth Pascal }
 if wages &gt; tax_threshold then
 begin
 paystax := true;
 tax := (wages - tax_threshold) * tax_rate
 { The block structure makes it easier to see how the code could
 be refactored for clarity, and also makes it easier to do,
 because the structure of the inner conditional can easily be moved
 out of the outer conditional altogether and the effects of doing
 so are easily predicted. }
 if wages &gt; supertax_threshold then begin
 pays_supertax := true;
 supertax := (wages - supertax_threshold) * supertax_rate
 end
 else begin
 pays_supertax := false;
 supertax := 0
 end
 end
 else begin
 paystax := false; pays_supertax := false;
 tax := 0; supertax := 0
 end;
 taxed := wages - tax - supertax;
Use of blocks in the above fragment of Pascal clarifies the programmer&#x27;s intent, and enables combining the resulting blocks into a nested hierarchy of conditional statements. The structure of the code reflects the programmer&#x27;s thinking more closely, making it easier to understand and modify.

The above source code can be made even clearer by taking the inner if statement out of the outer one altogether, placing the two blocks one after the other to be executed consecutively. Semantically there is little difference in this case, and the use of block structure, supported by indenting for readability, makes it easy for the programmer to refactor the code.

In primitive languages, variables had broad scope. For instance, an integer variable called IEMPNO might be used in one part of a Fortran subroutine to denote an employee social security number (ssn), but during maintenance work on the same subroutine, a programmer might accidentally use the same variable, IEMPNO, for a different purpose, and this could result in a bug that was difficult to trace. Block structure makes it easier for programmers to control scope to a minute level.
;; Language: R5RS Standard Scheme
(let ((empno (ssn-of employee-name)))
 (while (is-manager empno)
 (let ((employees (length (underlings-of empno))))
 (printf &quot;~a has ~a employees working under him:~%&quot; employee-name employees)
 (for-each
 (lambda (empno)
 ;; Within this lambda expression the variable empno refers to the ssn
 ;; of an underling. The variable empno in the outer expression,
 ;; referring to the manager&#x27;s ssn, is shadowed.
 (printf &quot;Name: ~a, role: ~a~%&quot;
 (name-of empno)
 (role-of empno)))
 (underlings-of empno)))))
In the above Scheme fragment, empno is used to identify both the manager and their underlings each by their respective ssn, but because the underling ssn is declared within an inner block it does not interact with the variable of the same name that contains the manager&#x27;s ssn. In practice, considerations of clarity would probably lead the programmer to choose distinct variable names, but they have the choice and it is more difficult to introduce a bug inadvertently.

==Hoisting==
In some languages, a variable can be declared at function scope even within enclosed blocks. For example, in JavaScript, variables declared with codice_12 have function scope.

<text>Operation Megaphone was the Canadian naval operation to board a Vincentian-flagged, American-owned merchant ship in the Atlantic, in order to recover $223 million worth of military materiel being transported back to Canada at the conclusion of operations in Kosovo.

==Background==

At the conclusion of Operation Kinetic, the Canadian contribution to a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo and Macedonia, the Department of National Defence contracted SDV Logistics Canada Ltd to transport military assets, including 580 vehicles, 390 sea containers of equipment and three Canadian soldiers who were escorting the cargo.

SDV Logistics subcontracted Andromeda Navigation Co. of Montreal, which chartered a St Vincent-flagged ship, GTS &quot;Katie&quot; (owned by Annapolis, Maryland-based Third Ocean Marine Navigation Company), to move the cargo.

The vessel was scheduled to leave Greece on 27 June 2000 and was to arrive in Canada on 15 July. Three Canadian military personnel were also on board the ship to escort the cargo, which included five armoured vehicles, rifles, ammunition, and communications equipment.

Prior to leaving Greece, three crew members had complained to authorities there, and the ship was restrained. Though it was not clear why the crew members complained, the ship was allowed to sail on 28 June after posting a US$30,000 bond.

During the voyage, a dispute between the various contracting parties arose over payments due, and Third Ocean claimed that $288,000 remained outstanding from Andromeda. As a result of the dispute, Third Ocean ordered the Russian captain of &quot;Katie&quot;, Vitaly Khlebnikov, not to enter Canadian waters.

==Boarding==

Negotiations continued between the Canadian government and the shippers, however an ultimatum was given and the three contractors failed to reach an agreement by a certain deadline, according to Art Eggleton, then the Minister of National Defence.

A diplomatic note was sent to the government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where the ship was registered, who authorized Canadians to board the vessel.

On 30 July, the destroyer received orders to close with &quot;Katie&quot; about 225 kilometres off Newfoundland, in international waters, and maintain visual contact with her. The following day, the frigate joined &quot;Athabaskan&quot;.

At 1:45 pm on 3 August, fourteen sailors boarded &quot;Katie&quot; in a helicopter-borne assault from a Sea King, led by Captain Drew Robertson, during which the crew of &quot;Katie&quot; offered no resistance. Captain Khlebnikov would later complain the boarding of the ship was &quot;dangerous&quot; and described the boarding as an &quot;attack&quot;, although Captain Robertson had observed that &quot;Katie&quot; began erratic, evasive manoeuvering after being warned of the imminent boarding.

Defence Minister Eggleton described the action as &quot;fully within the bounds of international law.&quot;

==Aftermath==

&quot;Katie&quot; arrived in Becancourt, Quebec, on 6 August under the control of the Canadian boarding party. Some of the cargo, including explosives, were removed at Becancourt, before the ship was brought further up the St Lawrence River to Montreal where the armoured and other military vehicles were unloaded.

Third Ocean filed an action &quot;in rem&quot; against the Canadian government, who owned the freight, on 27 July 2000, in the Federal Court of Canada, including a warrant for arrest of the freight. The matter was heard on 18 September, after the ship had already been seized by the Canadian navy. The court quashed the warrant and dismissed the action, on the basis of the immunity of the Crown, under the &quot;Crown Liability and Proceedings Act&quot;.

The Canadian Navy contracted &quot;Katie&quot; – and routinely contracts cargo ships – because it has no sea transport capability. The Canadian Forces have since then acquired four CC-177 Globemaster III strategic airlift cargo aircraft, each capable of carrying a payload of up to 72,000 kg, which were delivered in 2007. In 2010, shipbuilding was identified as a key procurement priority by the Canadian Forces, outlined in its &quot;Canada First Defence Strategy&quot;.

<doc id="381963" wikidata="Q2716205" url="?curid=381963" title="Wario's Woods">
<text>Wario&#x27;s Woods is a puzzle video game developed and published by Nintendo. It was released in Japan and North America in 1994 and Europe in 1995 for both the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. A spin-off of the &quot;Mario&quot; series, players control Toad in his mission to defeat Wario, who has taken control of the Peaceful Woods. Gameplay revolves around clearing each level by using bombs to destroy groups of enemies. The game also features a multiplayer mode that allows two players to compete against each other.

The NES version is noteworthy for being the last officially-licensed game as well as the final first-party game for the system in North America, due to its release at the end of the console&#x27;s lifespan. It is also the only NES game to receive a rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which was inducted several months before the game&#x27;s release. In Japan, the game was released alongside a re-release of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; to coincide with the release of the AV Famicom.

&quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot; has been re-released several times for other platforms, such as the Satellaview and the Virtual Console. The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay, design, and multiplayer mode, though some believed it was not as refined as Nintendo&#x27;s previous puzzle games like &quot;Dr. Mario&quot;, and lacked depth and enough content to keep players engaged.

==Plot and gameplay==

The &quot;Peaceful Woods&quot; was once a peaceful area for sprites and gentle creatures. After the invasion of Wario and his group of monsters, the forest community was &quot;turned upside-down&quot; where peaceful creatures are no longer welcome. To stop Wario, Toad arrives to stop him and return the Woods back over to the sprites by going after Wario himself.

The objective of &quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot; is to clear the playing field of monsters of varying colors by using bombs of matching color, which are dropped into the field from the top of the screen by a sprite. In order to do so, the monsters and bombs must be rearranged by the player such that three or more objects of the same color are placed adjacent to one another in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows, with at least one object being a bomb (such rows are called a &quot;match&quot;). For example, a match may consist of two red monsters and one red bomb, but may also consist of two red bombs and one red monster. However, a match cannot consist of three monsters of the same type. A Thwomp may also come down a number of rows (being disguised as the ceiling), making less room for the player to match enemies and bombs. When the play field is cleared of all the monsters, the player progresses to the next round, where the initial number of monsters increases. There are different monster types that can only be destroyed in specific ways, such as requiring two matches in quick succession or being placed into a diagonal match.

Unlike other action puzzle games such as &quot;Tetris&quot; or &quot;Puzzle League&quot; where the player directly manipulates the game pieces, either as they fall or via a cursor, the player directly controls the character Toad, who moves around inside the playing field atop the fallen objects. Toad can pick up individual objects or lift entire stacks and place them elsewhere in the playing field, but is unable to manipulate objects he cannot immediately reach. However, Toad can perform a variety of additional tricks, such as kicking objects across the play field and scurrying up the sides of stacks to retrieve specific objects. If the player cannot clear the playing field of its objects quickly enough, the play field will eventually fill to the brim and trap Toad, resulting in a Game Over.

The game has a multiplayer mode, called &#x27;VS&#x27; or &#x27;VS 2P&#x27;, where the player can play against another player. In the multiplayer mode, players can make two or more matches after another to make a stack of enemies on their opponents field.

==Re-releases==
Two modified versions of the SNES version of &quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot; were released in Japan for the Satellaview, a satellite modem add-on for the Super Famicom. The first version was copyrighted in 1994 and released under the name . The Bakushou Version featured personalities from the Japanese radio comedy show, Bakushō Mondai.

The second version of &quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot; broadcast for Satellaview was released under the name . It was broadcast from April 23, 1995, to June 30, 2000, throughout the lifespan of the Satellaview. The game was quite popular and it was rebroadcast at least seven times throughout the tenure of St.GIGA&#x27;s Satellaview-broadcasting period. The game was also broadcast at least once as one of the Satellaview&#x27;s special event versions.

The NES version of &quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot; is available as a collectible item in the 2001 game &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; for the GameCube, obtained through use of the GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable. This version was one of the first titles available for the Wii Virtual Console, released alongside the service&#x27;s launch in North America, Australia, and Europe, and on December 12, 2006, in Japan. It was available for purchase at the Wii Shop Channel for 500 Nintendo Points. It was released for the eShop in Japan on May 29, 2013, for the Nintendo 3DS and on January 29, 2014, for the Wii U, in Europe for the 3DS on October 24, 2013, and for the 3DS and the Wii U eShop in North America on November 7, 2013. The game was added to the Nintendo Switch Online service on December 13, 2018.

==Reception==
&quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot; has received mixed reviews. Reviewing the SNES version, &quot;GamePro&quot; called it &quot;a ho-hum puzzler&quot;, commenting that though it has some interesting gameplay mechanics, it ultimately fails to be more than a standard &quot;Tetris&quot; clone. They also regarded the controls as difficult. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; reviewed the game noting that it had a fun two-player mode and was challenging and fast-paced while saying that it&#x27;s not as easy to control as &quot;Tetris 2&quot;. For the individual scores, the game ranked scores evenly for graphic and sound for both systems, but gave slightly higher scores for the Super NES in the Play Control, Challenge, and Theme and Fun categories. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; argued that the gameplay mechanics are too complicated for an action puzzle game and that the learning curve in the game is &quot;too steep&quot;.

In retrospective reviews, Allgame rated &quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot; 4 stars out of 5 for the NES version, and 3.5 stars out of 5 for the SNES version. Christian Huey, who reviewed the NES version, wrote that the controls were &quot;both surprisingly complex and completely intuitive&quot; while the gameplay has a &quot;surprising level of depth&quot;, and labeled the two-player versus mode as welcome addition to the game. Scott Alan Marriott, who reviewed the SNES version, felt that the game &quot;doesn&#x27;t quite measure up to the addictiveness of either &quot;Tetris&quot; or &quot;Dr. Mario&quot;&quot;, citing the game&#x27;s &quot;extremely awkward&quot; controls and complicated gameplay. While Marriott appreciated &quot;that the developers were trying something new&quot;, he also argued that sometimes when adding things to an already proven formula for action puzzle games can work, it can also &quot;dilute&quot; the ingredients that made the game a success.

The reviews for the Virtual Console release were mixed, applauding the gameplay and depth, but criticizing the choice to release the primitive NES version over the more comprehensive SNES version. Lucas Thomas of IGN awarded the game an 8.0 out of 10, praising the game&#x27;s unique approach to the puzzle genre and graphics that &quot;took full advantage of the 8-bit hardware [and were] full of character&quot;, but recommended saving Nintendo Points for the SNES version. Aaron Thomas of GameSpot gave &quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot; a score of 7.0 out of 10, admiring the &quot;fun, addictive game play&quot; and &quot;surprising amount of depth&quot;, but criticizing the game&#x27;s repetitive music and poor sound effects, adding that he also prefers the &quot;ideal&quot; SNES version. Nintendo Life scored the game 6 out of 10, stating that while the game is fun, he noted the game&#x27;s length to be short. IGN ranked the game 29th on their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time&quot;.

<text>Tom Byron (born Thomas Bryan Taliaferro Jr.; April 4, 1961) is an American former pornographic actor, director, and producer. A member of the XRCO and the AVN Halls of Fame, he was voted #20 in AVN&#x27;s list of top 50 pornstars of all time. Byron is also co-founder of Xtreme Professional Wrestling, a wrestling promotion that began in Los Angeles in 1999 and was resurrected in 2019 in Rochester, New York. He continues to work as an editor for XPW TV. 

==Early life==
Byron is of Italian descent and was raised in Orange, Texas. He attended Stark High School and later West Orange-Stark high school where he graduated in 1979. He attended Houston Baptist University on a full scholarship, but dropped out after a semester and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of appearing in adult films.

==Acting==
Byron first started acting in hardcore films in May 1982, and continued to perform mostly in roles portraying doctors or &quot;coming of age&quot; scenarios, as he resembled a teenager even though he was in his early to mid-20s. He starred alongside the underage Traci Lords in many films including her porn debut in early 1984, &quot;What Gets Me Hot!&quot;. He performed with Ginger Lynn in her second-ever scene, and claims that experience convinced the actress to remain in porn after her first scene with Ron Jeremy had her contemplating quitting the business. &quot;America, you have me to thank for Ginger Lynn&quot;, Byron has said. 

In porn&#x27;s 1980s heyday, Byron says that pills such as Viagra didn&#x27;t yet exist to help male performers, and many including himself regularly smoked cannabis before filming as a means of getting in the mood. Byron did, however, begin to turn to pills for help later in his career. &quot;Viagra kept me in the game for at least ten years after my due date&quot;, he says. 

He was rumored to have had an ongoing off-screen relationship with Lords in the mid-80s, though in the years since he has alternately downplayed their relationship and admitted that he had been in love with her. He says he &quot;fell hard&quot; in love with porn actress Jill Kelly in the early 90s after the suicide of her estranged husband Cal Jammer. Byron also dated porn actress Tera Patrick early in her career. 

He has changed his image several times throughout his career, frequently portraying a clean-shaven, adolescent virgin in his early years in porn. His late 1980s long-haired hard rock persona was no pretense, as Byron was also a struggling hard rock musician in Hollywood with hopes of a career in music. In 1986, he released a music video for his song &quot;Cat Alley&quot;. By the early 1990s, Byron again changed his persona and appearance to that of a clean-cut &quot;businessman&quot; type.

In a 2020 interview, Byron said Jamie Summers was his all-time favorite co-star, citing her &quot;amazing pussy&quot;. He named Jada Stevens and Gia Derza as his favorite then-current performers, though he retired before he had an opportunity to work with either of them.

In August 2003, Byron announced his retirement from performing to focus on his directing career. However, in 2006, after just three years, he returned to performing in numerous scenes.

==Post-retirement==
Byron currently resides in upstate New York. He says that a return to performing in porn is extremely unlikely, as age has caught up with him and he currently has problems maintaining an erection. &quot;What am I... 59 now? I&#x27;m done! It&#x27;s all over with,&quot; he said. 

In 2020, Byron revealed that he is busy writing his autobiography with the help of author Mike Sager, whose work inspired the award-winning 1997 motion picture &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. Byron has said there is already interest in turning his story into a major motion picture. 

==Filmography==
Byron appeared in about 3,200 videos in his pornographic career, making him the most credited actor in the Internet Adult Film Database as of January 2013.

His earliest video that can be dated with certainty is &quot;Anything Goes&quot; from 1982.

<text>Peon (English , from the Spanish &quot;&quot; ) usually refers to a person subject to peonage: any form of wage labor, financial exploitation, coercive economic practice, or policy in which the victim or a laborer (peon) has little control over employment or economic conditions. Peon and peonage can refer to both the colonial period and post-colonial period of Latin America, as well as the period after the end of slavery in the United States, when &quot;Black Codes&quot; were passed to retain African-American freedmen as labor through other means.

==Usage==
In English, &quot;peon&quot; (doublet of &quot;pawn&quot;) and &quot;peonage&quot; have meanings related to their Spanish etymology (foot soldier); a &quot;peon&quot; may be defined as a person with little authority, often assigned unskilled tasks; an underling or any person subjected to capricious or unreasonable oversight. In this sense, &quot;peon&quot; can be used in either a derogatory or self-effacing context.

There are similar usages in contemporary cultures:
* South Asian dialects of English: a peon is an office boy, an attendant, or an orderly, a person kept around for odd jobs (and, historically, a policeman or foot soldier).
* Shanghai: among native Chinese working in firms where English is spoken, the word refers to a worker with little authority, who suffers indignities from superiors.

However, the term has a historical basis and usage related to much more severe conditions of forced labor:
* American English: in a historical and legal sense, &quot;peon&quot; generally referred to someone working in a compelled labor system (known as &quot;peonage&quot;). The term often refers to debt bondage or indentured servitude.

==History==

The Spanish conquest of Mexico and Caribbean islands included peonage; the conquistadors forced natives to work for Spanish planters and mine operators. Peonage was prevalent in Latin America, especially in the countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador and Peru. It remains an important part of social life, as among the Urarina of the Peruvian Amazon.

==Peonage in the United States==

After the American Civil War of 1861–1865, peonage developed in the Southern United States. Poor white farmers and formerly enslaved African Americans known as freedmen, who could not afford their own land, would farm another person&#x27;s land, exchanging labor for a share of the crops. This was called sharecropping. The land owner would pay for the seeds and tools in exchange for a percentage of the money earned from the crop and a portion of the crop. As time passed, many landowners began to abuse this system. The landowner would force the tenant farmer or sharecropper to buy seeds and tools from the land owner&#x27;s store, which often had inflated prices. As sharecroppers were often illiterate, they had to depend on the books and accounting by the landowner and his staff. Other tactics included debiting expenses against the sharecropper&#x27;s profits after the crop was harvested and &quot;miscalculating&quot; the net profit from the harvest, thereby keeping the sharecropper in perpetual debt to the landowner. Since the tenant farmers could not offset the costs, they were forced into involuntary labor due to the debts they owed the landowner. Additionally, unpredictable or disruptive climatic conditions, such as droughts or storms, caused disruptions to seasonal plantings or harvests, which in turn, caused the tenant farmers to accrue debts with the landowners.

After the U.S. Civil War, the South passed &quot;Black Codes&quot;, laws to control freed black slaves. Vagrancy laws were included in these Black Codes. Homeless or unemployed African Americans who were between jobs, most of whom were former slaves, were arrested and fined as vagrants. Usually lacking the resources to pay the fine, the &quot;vagrant&quot; was sent to county labor or hired out under the convict lease program to a private employer. The authorities also tried to restrict the movement of freedmen between rural areas and cities, to between towns.

Under such laws, local officials arbitrarily arrested tens of thousands of people and charged them with fines and court costs of their cases. Black freedmen were those most aggressively targeted. Poor whites were also arrested, but usually in much smaller numbers. White merchants, farmers, and business owners were allowed to pay these debts, and the prisoner had to work off the debt. Prisoners were leased as laborers to owners and operators of coal mines, lumber camps, brickyards, railroads, quarries, and farm plantations, with the lease revenues for their labor going to the states. The lessors were responsible for room and board of the laborers, and frequently abused them with little oversight by the state. Government officials leased imprisoned blacks and whites to small town entrepreneurs, provincial farmers, and dozens of corporations looking for cheap labor. Their labor was repeatedly bought and sold for decades, well into the 20th century, long after the official abolition of American slavery.

Southern states and private businesses profited by this form of unpaid labor. It is estimated that at the beginning of the 20th century, up to 40% of blacks in the South were trapped in peonage. Overseers and owners often used severe physical deprivation, beatings, whippings, and other abuse as &quot;discipline&quot; against the workers.

After the Civil War, the Thirteenth Amendment prohibited involuntary servitude such as peonage for all but convicted criminals. Congress also passed various laws to protect the constitutional rights of Southern blacks, making those who violated such rights by conspiracy, by trespass, or in disguise, guilty of an offense punishable by ten years in prison and civil disability. Unlawful use of state law to subvert rights under the Federal Constitution was made punishable by fine or a year&#x27;s imprisonment. But until the involuntary servitude was abolished by president Lyndon B. Johnson in August 6, 1966, sharecroppers in Southern states were forced to continue working to pay off old debts or to pay taxes. Southern states allowed this in order to preserve sharecropping.

The following reported court cases involved peonage:
*1903 – South Dakota, a 17-year-old girl was reported to have been sold into peonage at the age of two by her own father
*1904 – Alabama, ten persons indicted for holding black and white persons in peonage
*1906 – John W. Pace of Alabama, the &quot;father&quot; of peonage; pardoned by his friend President Theodore Roosevelt.
*1906 – Five officials of Jackson Lumber Company sentenced in Pensacola, Florida, to prison terms ranging from 13 months to 18 months. One of the defendants was fined $5,000, while the others were each fined $1,000.
*1916 – Edward McCree of Georgia Legislature; owner of 37,000 acres of land; indicted on 13 charges. Pleaded guilty to first charge and paid a $1,000.00 fine.
*1916 – two men found guilty in Lexington County, South Carolina, of trying to force a white man into peonage; each fined $500 and sentenced to a year and day in jail
*1921 – Hawaiian sugar plantation owners unsuccessfully try to legalize peonage of Chinese workers.
*1921 – Georgia Willams Plantation Murders: farmer John S. Williams and his black overseer Clyde Manning were convicted in the deaths of 11 blacks working as peons at Williams&#x27; farm. Williams was the only white farmer in Georgia convicted of murder for killing black peons since April 1, 1877.
*1922 – Convicted in 1921 for hopping a freight train in Florida without a ticket, Martin Tabert of North Dakota becomes part of Florida State Convict leasing. He died Feb 1, 1922, after being whipped for being unable to work due to illness. Reports of his death led to the prohibition in 1923 of convict leasing in Florida. The man who killed Tarbert, Thomas Walter Higginbotham, was later sentenced to 20 years in prison for second degree murder.
*1923 – Investigations of the Tabert killing by the Florida state legislature in 1923 led to evidence of widespread abuses in north Florida and found that peonage was standard practice at the Knabb Turpentine camp in Baker County belonging to State Senator T. J. Knabb.
*1925 – Pensacola, Florida - White farmer and four others found guilty of using negro workers in peonage
*1925 – Columbia, South Carolina - An African-American youth who had been missing since 1923 escaped from peonage at a work camp.
*1954 - Sumter County, Alabama - Two brothers Oscar and Fred Dial were convicted in May of holding two African-American men in peonage. In December they were sentenced to eighteen months in federal prison.

Because of the Spanish tradition, peonage remained legal and widespread in the New Mexico Territory even after the Civil War. In response, Congress passed the Peonage Act of 1867 on March 2, 1867, which said: &quot;Sec 1990. The holding of any person to service or labor under the system known as peonage is abolished and forever prohibited in the territory of New Mexico, or in any other territory or state of the United States; and all acts, laws, … made to establish, maintain, or enforce, directly or indirectly, the voluntary or involuntary service or labor of any persons as peons, in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or otherwise, are declared null and void.&quot; The current version of this statute is codified at Chapter 21-I of and makes no specific mention of New Mexico.

<text>was a Japanese mathematician who did fundamental work in the theory of several complex variables.

==Biography==

Oka was born in Osaka. He went to Kyoto Imperial University in 1919, turning to mathematics in 1923 and graduating in 1924.

He was in Paris for three years from 1929, returning to Hiroshima University. He published solutions to the first and second Cousin problems, and work on domains of holomorphy, in the period 1936–1940. He received his Doctor of Science degree from Kyoto Imperial University in 1940. These were later taken up by Henri Cartan and his school, playing a basic role in the development of sheaf theory.

The Oka–Weil theorem is due to a work of André Weil in 1935 and Oka&#x27;s work in 1937.

Oka continued to work in the field, and proved Oka&#x27;s coherence theorem in 1950. Oka&#x27;s lemma is also named after him.

He was a professor at Nara Women&#x27;s University from 1949 to retirement at 1964. He received many honours in Japan.

<doc id="381982" wikidata="Q181071" url="?curid=381982" title="New Romney">
<text>New Romney is a market town in Kent, England, on the edge of Romney Marsh, an area of flat, rich agricultural land reclaimed from the sea after the harbour began to silt up. New Romney, one of the original Cinque Ports, was once a sea port, with the harbour adjacent to the church, but is now more than a mile from the sea. It is the headquarters of the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.

==Geography==
New Romney is not significantly different in age from the nearby village of Old Romney. However New Romney, now about a mile and a half from the seafront, was originally a harbour town at the mouth of the River Rother. The Rother estuary was always difficult to navigate, with many shallow channels and sandbanks. The names of two local settlements, Greatstone and Littlestone, are a reminder of these aids. Another possible explanation for these place-names is a result of the effects of longshore drift, which disperses shingle and sand deposits, from west to east, with heavier stones accumulating in the area known as Greatstone, while far smaller shingle is to be found in great quantities at Littlestone. Very fine sand is found further east at neighbouring St Mary&#x27;s Bay.

==History==

In the latter part of the thirteenth century a series of severe storms weakened the coastal defences of Romney Marsh, and the South England flood of February 1287 almost destroyed the town, as it did destroy the nearby ancient parish of Broomhill. The harbour and town were filled with sand, silt, mud and debris, and the River Rother changed course to run out into the sea near Rye, Sussex. The mud, silt and sand were never entirely removed from the town, which is why many old buildings, especially the church, have steps leading down into them from the present pavement level.

New Romney is one of the original Cinque Ports of England, although its importance declined rapidly during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries after the loss of the harbour. Archaeological investigations in 2007 during replacement of the town&#x27;s main drainage have cast new light on the medieval origins and development of the town. New Romney Town Hall was built in 1702.

During World War II a fleet of floating concrete harbour sections (called Mulberry Harbours) were towed across the English Channel to France to aid the Allied landings. One of these harbour pieces remains, embedded in a sandbank just off the coast by Littlestone-on-Sea, and is clearly visible at low tide. Further up the coast during the Pipe Line Under The Ocean, or PLUTO, oil was pumped to France under the English Channel for use by allied troops.

New Romney is the main centre of population on the Romney Marsh. Founded in 1610 by John Southland and formerly known locally as just &quot;Southland&#x27;s&quot;, John Southland&#x27;s Community Comprehensive School, the only secondary school in the area, was renamed The Marsh Academy in August 2007.

==Town centre==
Like many towns on the marsh it has an impressive Norman church, the Church of St Nicholas, in the centre of town. This church originally stood at the harbourside, and its entrances are several feet below ground level. The church is also notable for the boat hooks still evident on the side walls.

New Romney&#x27;s historic high street has several small and interesting shops. A few businesses closed after the opening of a branch of supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s, but the town retains much of its character. The former almshouses in West Street are noted historic buildings of Kent; they were founded in 1610 by John Southland, an important local magnate, and rebuilt in 1734. Adjacent to these is Plantagenet House and No 3 Old Stone Cottage, which originated as a single house constructed c. 1300–1350. Researchers think it was originally the home of the Master of The Hospital of St John the Baptist, a large secular establishment. The hospital was operating by c. 1260 and flourished until the close of the fifteenth century.

Three-quarters of a mile north of the town is the links golf course at Littlestone-on-Sea. The golf course was a favourite of Denis Thatcher, late husband of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, and has been used several times for the qualifying rounds of The Open Championship.

==Transport==
The Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway has a station at the extreme east of New Romney, which as well as being a major tourist attraction was also used by students travelling to school until 2015. The station is about three-quarters of a mile east of the historic town centre.

New Romney was once serviced by the New Romney and Littlestone-On-Sea railway station which was part of the Lydd Line. The station was sited halfway between New Romney and Littlestone-on-Sea. As built the station had two platforms and a small goods yard with four sidings, a goods shed, cattle dock, coal wharves, end loading dock, water tower and other small buildings. The up platform was rarely used in latter years other than as a livestock loading dock. The station was originally called New Romney &amp; Littlestone with on-Sea being added in October 1888. In 1927 a single line extension was built with an unprotected level crossing to an exchange siding with the adjacent Romney Hythe and Dymchurch Railway station on the opposite side of the Station Road; it was used to deliver coal to that railway. The signal box was taken out of use in the 1950s and goods service was withdrawn in 1964. The station was closed in 1967 and replaced with a bus service.

New Romney is easily accessible by road, sitting astride the A259 (which runs from Folkestone to Havant). Several bus services run to and through New Romney from Hastings, Folkestone and Ashford.

==Media==
New Romney has one dedicated weekly newspaper, the &quot;Kentish Express&quot; (published by the KM Group) is the only weekly newspaper for the Romney Marsh covering the town. There is also the &quot;Folkestone Herald&quot; (which incorporated the &quot;Romney Marsh Herald&quot; in 2014, published by Kent Regional News and Media). The local radio station for New Romney is KMFM Ashford which contains Marsh-based adverts amongst a county-wide station, and New Romney is also served by the county-wide stations Heart South, Gold and BBC Radio Kent. 

Cinque Ports Radio 100.2FM is the community radio station for Romney Marsh and has been broadcasting since 7 March 2022 replacing Shoreline FM which now broadcasts online to the same area as Shoreline Easy and previously broadcast on 100.2FM since January 2020 

In 1951 the Richard Burton, Roger Livesey, and Honor Blackman film &quot;Green Grow the Rushes&quot; was made on location in and around New Romney and in nearby St Mary in the Marsh.

==Namesakes==
In 1762 Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron named the town of Romney in present-day West Virginia in the United States after the town of New Romney.

<text>Northwich is a market town and civil parish in the Cheshire West and Chester borough of Cheshire, England. It lies on the Cheshire Plain, at the confluence of the rivers Weaver and Dane, east of Chester, south of Warrington and south of Manchester. The population of the parish was 22,726 at the 2021 census.

The area around Northwich was exploited for its salt pans by the Romans, when the settlement was known as &quot;Condate&quot;. The town had been severely affected by salt mining and subsidence was historically a significant problem. Mine stabilisation work was completed in 2007.

==History==
===Early history===
During Roman times, Northwich was known as &quot;Condate&quot;, thought to be a Latinisation of a Brittonic name meaning &quot;Confluence&quot;. There are several other sites of the same name, mostly in France; in Northwich&#x27;s case, it lies at the junction of the rivers Dane and Weaver.

Northwich can be identified through two contemporary Roman documents. The first of these is the Antonine Itinerary, a 3rd-century road map split into 14 sections. Two of these sections, or Itinerary, mention Condate: Route II (&quot;the route from the Wall to the port of Rutupiae&quot;) and Route X (&quot;the route from Glannoventa to Mediolanum&quot;). The second document is the 7th-century &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot;; it refers to Condate between the entries for Salinae (now Middlewich, Cheshire) and Ratae (now Leicester, Leicestershire), at the time the capital of the Corieltauvi tribe.

The Romans&#x27; interest in the Northwich area is thought to be due to the strategic river crossing and the location of the salt brines. Salt was very important in Roman society; the Roman word &quot;salarium&quot;, linked employment, salt and soldiers, but the exact link is unclear. It is also theorised that this is the basis for the modern word &quot;salary&quot;. Another theory is that the word &quot;soldier&quot; itself comes from the Latin &quot;sal dare&quot; (to give salt). There is archaeological evidence of a Roman auxiliary fort within the area of Northwich, now known as &quot;Castle&quot;, dated to AD 70. This, and other north-western forts, were built as the Romans moved north from their stronghold in Chester.

The association with salt continues in the etymology of Northwich. The &quot;wich&quot; (or &quot;wych&quot;) suffix applies to other towns in the area: Middlewich, Nantwich and Leftwich. This is considered to have been derived from the Norse, &quot;wic&quot; for bay, and is associated with the more traditional method of obtaining salt by evaporating sea water. Therefore, a place for making salt became a &quot;wych-house&quot;; Northwich was the most northern of the -wich towns in Cheshire.

===Medieval to early modern===
The existence of Northwich in the early medieval period is shown by its record in the Domesday Book of 1086:

The manor of Northwich belonged to the Earls of Chester until 1237, when the family line died out. Subsequently, Northwich became a royal manor and was given to a noble family to collect tolls in exchange for a set rent.

The Cheshire archers were a body of élite soldiers noted for their skills with the longbow, who fought in many engagements in Britain and France in the Middle Ages. Battles at which there were sizeable numbers of Cheshire archers include Agincourt and Crécy; many of these archers hailed from the Northwich Hundred. Richard II employed a bodyguard of these yeoman archers who came from the Macclesfield Hundred and the forest districts of Cheshire.

That salt production continued throughout the centuries and can be seen through John Leland&#x27;s description of the town in 1540:

Between 1642 and 1643, during the English Civil War, Northwich was fortified and garrisoned by Sir William Brereton for the Parliamentarians.

The salt beds beneath Northwich were rediscovered in the 1670s by employees of the local Smith-Barry family. The Smith-Barrys were looking for coal, but instead discovered rock salt, in the grounds of the family home, Marbury Hall (since demolished) to the north of Northwich.

===19th century===
During the 19th century, it became uneconomical to mine for the salt; instead, hot water was pumped through the mines, which dissolved the salt. The resultant brine was pumped out, from which the salt was extracted. This technique weakened the mines and led to land subsidence as they collapsed. Subsidence affected the town and the surrounding landscape. For example, collapses in 1880 formed Witton Flash as the River Weaver flowed into a huge hole caused by subsidence. Subsidence also allegedly accounts for many old timber-framed houses in the town centre, which were better able to withstand the movement of the ground. Some houses were built on a base of steel girders that could be jacked up to level the house with each change in the underlying ground. The town&#x27;s historical link with the salt industry is celebrated in its the Weaver Hall Museum and Workhouse, which is now in the old workhouse.

In 1874, John Brunner and Ludwig Mond founded Brunner Mond in Winnington and started manufacturing soda ash using the Solvay ammonia-soda process. This process used salt as a main raw material. The chemical industry used the subsided land for the disposal of waste from the manufacture of soda-ash. The waste was transported through a network of cranes and rails to the produce &quot;limebeds&quot;. This was a dangerous alkaline substance and caused the landscape to be abandoned as unusable.

==Modern development==

In 1975, Marbury Country Park was the first area to be reclaimed from dereliction and has become a popular recreational area. In 1987, more land was reclaimed to form Furey Wood and over later years, Cheshire County Council&#x27;s Land Regeneration Unit reclaimed what is now known as Anderton Nature Park, Witton Flash, Dairy House Meadows, Witton Mill Meadows, and Ashton&#x27;s and Neumann&#x27;s Flashes. The area now extends to approximately of public space known as Northwich Community Woodlands.

In February 2004, a £28 million programme to stabilise the abandoned salt mines underneath Northwich began. The work was funded by the English Partnerships through its &quot;Land Stabilisation Programme&quot;, introduced to resolve issues associated with unstable mines around England.

The four mines identified for work were Baron&#x27;s Quay, Witton Bank, Neumann&#x27;s and Penny&#x27;s Lane. These mines were chosen because their subsidence was causing problems for the town centre. The stabilisation plan involved removing millions of litres of brine from the four mines and replacing it with a mixture of pulverised fuel ash (PFA), cement and salt. The project was completed in late 2007.

The old Magistrates Court and Memorial Hall have been demolished and been replaced by &quot;Memorial Court&quot;, a £12.5 million cultural and leisure centre, which offers a pool, dance studios and a gym.

The £80 million Barons Quay Development, a retail and leisure complex, opened in 2016 and has seen the creation of more than of shopping space, together with a large supermarket with a petrol filling station, cinema, restaurants, cafés, new public spaces and car parking. As of January 2023, roughly half of the retail space remains empty.

A major fire occurred at the Northwich Outdoor Market on 3 January 2020. The market&#x27;s remains were quickly demolished and, so far, there are no plans to rebuild it. 

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Northwich, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Northwich Town Council and Cheshire West and Chester Council. The town council is based at 78 Church Road. Cheshire West and Chester Council also has an area office at the Memorial Court building on Chester Way. For national elections, Northwich is part of the Mid Cheshire constituency.

===Administrative history===
At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, Northwich was in the hundred of Middlewich. By the 14th century, it had become part of the Northwich hundred. This probably happened during the reorganisation of the hundreds in the 12th century. Northwich was described as a borough in the late 13th century, but it had no municipal charter, and borough status for the town did not endure.

The town formed part of the ancient parish of Great Budworth. The parish was subdivided into numerous townships, including a Northwich township of just at the confluence of the rivers Weaver and Dane, corresponding to the medieval core of the town. The neighbouring townships were Castle Northwich to the south-west, Winnington to the north-west, and Witton cum Twambrooks to the east, all of which also formed part of Great Budworth parish. To the south was the township of Leftwich, which formed part of the parish of Davenham.
St Helen&#x27;s Church was built in 14th century at Witton to serve as a chapel of ease for the southern townships of Great Budworth parish. In 1723, St Helen&#x27;s was assigned a parochial chapelry district and given its own clergy, effectively separating it from Great Budworth for most ecclesiastical purposes. The Witton chapelry initially covered the townships of Birches, Castle Northwich, Hartford, Hulse, Lach Dennis, Lostock Gralam, Northwich, Winnington, Witton cum Twambrooks, and part of Rudheath. The chapelry was gradually reduced in area as more churches were built. The ecclesiastical separation from Great Budworth was confirmed in 1900, at which point the chapelry was renamed &quot;St Helen Witton, otherwise Northwich&quot;.

From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Great Budworth and Davenham, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so the townships also became civil parishes, which therefore diverged from the ecclesiastical parishes.

During 1863, the Northwich and Witton cum Twambrooks townships were each made local government districts, administered by separate local boards. The two districts were merged into a single Northwich district in 1875, which also took in the whole of the Castle Northwich township and parts of the townships of Hartford, Leftwich and Winnington. Such local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Also in 1894, the parishes within the district were united into a single civil parish of Northwich matching the district.
Northwich Urban District Council took over the former Northwich Grammar School buildings (built 1878) on Church Road after the school relocated in 1908. The building was converted to become the council&#x27;s offices and meeting place and renamed the Council House, opening in 1913. The urban district was enlarged in 1936 by the addition of parts of Winnington, Lostock Gralam, Barnton, Leftwich and Rudheath; then again in 1955, when parts of Davenham, Hartford, Rudheath and Whatcroft were added. The urban district council was granted a coat of arms in 1962, which features the Latin motto &quot;Sal est Vita&quot;, meaning &quot;Salt is Life&quot;.

Northwich Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the new district (borough after 1988) of Vale Royal. A successor parish called Northwich covering the area of the former urban district was created, with its parish council taking the name Northwich Town Council. The former urban district council&#x27;s coat of arms was transferred to the new town council.

In 2009, Cheshire West and Chester Council was created, taking over the functions of the borough council and Cheshire County Council, which were both abolished.

Between 1885 and 1983, Northwich gave its name to the Northwich parliamentary constituency.

==Geography==
Northwich is situated in the Cheshire Plain at co-ordinates h (53.255, −2.522). The town lies between above mean sea level. The town is surrounded by the following civil parishes, starting due north and proceeding in a clockwise direction: Anderton with Marbury, Marston, Wincham, Lostock Gralam, Rudheath, Davenham, Hartford, Weaverham and Barnton.

Two rivers meet in the town centre: the rivers Weaver and Dane. The town is surrounded by undulating pasture. Subsidence and the collapse of underground saltworks has created flashes and there are also local meres; for example, to the north is Budworth Mere and to the north-east is Pick Mere.

==Demographics==
The Northwich urban area is defined in different ways by different authorities.

For town planning purposes, Cheshire West and Chester Council&#x27;s Local Plan identifies a &#x27;Northwich settlement area&#x27; which also includes Anderton, Barnton, Davenham, Hartford, Lostock Gralam, Lower Marston, Lower Wincham, Rudheath, and Weaverham.

The Northwich Neighbourhood Plan (2018) records a population figure of 53,391 for the urban area at the 2011 census, derived from combining the populations of the parishes of Northwich, Anderton with Marbury, Barnton, Davenham, Hartford, Kingsmead, Lostock Gralam, Rudheath, Weaverham and Wincham. At the 2021 census, the same group of parishes had a combined population of 58,950.

Following the 2011 census, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) defined a Northwich built up area with a population of 47,421, divided into two built up area subdivisions of Northwich (population 45,471) and Lostock Gralam (population 1,950).

For the 2021 census, the ONS defined a much smaller built up area for Northwich, with a population of 18,640. Areas which had been part of the Northwich built up area in 2011 have been classed as separate built up areas in 2021, including Barnton (population 6,255), Davenham (13,835), and Hartford (6,695). Weaverham, although classed as part of the Northwich settlement or urban area in the Local Plan and Neighbourhood Plan, was not included in the ONS definitions of the built up area in either 2011 or 2021.

The population of Northwich in 1664 has been estimated as 560; over the last 200 years, it has been:


==Economy==
Northwich has been described by Leland as having a market since at least 1535, but there is no surviving charter. The town still has a market today, which is earmarked for refurbishment as part of the &quot;Northwich Vision&quot; plans.

The town&#x27;s economy was dominated by the salt industry. However, a list of tolls for goods crossing over Northwich bridge in 1353 shows goods coming into the town, including a wide range of carcasses, fleeces, hides and skins, cloth, fish, alcoholic drinks, dairy products, building materials, household goods, metals and glass, and millstones. This indicates a much wider economic base to medieval Northwich than just the salt trade. Documentary evidence also exists for a mill from 1332 onwards and there is evidence for more than one mill from 1343.

Allied to the extraction of salt was a bulk chemical industry, which became concentrated at the three ICI sites at Winnington, Wallerscote and Lostock. The first industrially practical method for producing polythene was accidentally discovered at the Winnington Laboratory in 1933.

Bakers Frank Roberts &amp; Sons have been associated with the town since 1887 and continues to be based near the town at Rudheath on the A556. Two of its three main business divisions, Roberts Bakery and The Little Treats Co, are based in Northwich and Aldred&#x27;s The Bakers is in Ilkeston, Derbyshire.

There are many contemporary major employers in nearby Rudheath and Hartford.

Based on the 2001 census, Northwich had 13,928 people aged between 16 and 74. Of these, 8,908 (64.0%) people were categorised as economically active; 4,268 (30.6%) were economically inactive; 455 (3.3%) were unemployed.

==Landmarks and religious sites==
The parish church is known as St. Helen&#x27;s Witton; it is a Grade I listed building. The church developed initially as a chapel of ease, associated with the parish of Great Budworth, to serve the local community, known as the &quot;Chapel of Witton&quot;. There is no known date for the creation of this chapel, but it is thought to have existed in the 13th century. None of this building exists in the current church. There is no documentary evidence to indicate the dates of the older parts of the current building; however, stones in the fabric of the porch carry inscriptions attributed to &quot;Ricardus Alkoke Capellanus&quot;. This name matches documents concerning land in Northwich and Lostock Gralam dated 1468, but this cannot be used to date the church accurately.

The present St Wilfrid&#x27;s (Roman Catholic)] church was built in 1866. The current Northwich Methodist Chapel was opened in 1990, but there has been a Methodist presence in the town at least since 1774, when John Wesley laid the foundation stone of the first chapel in the London Road area.

The Northwich Union Workhouse opened in 1837, following the Poor Law Amendment of 1834 that standardised the system of poor relief throughout Britain. The building is now the Weaver Hall Museum.

The Dock Road Edwardian Pumping Station is a Grade II listed building originally built by Northwich Urban District Council in 1913. For over 60 years, it was used for pumping sewage from parts of Northwich to the Wallerscote Treatment Works. Before it was built, untreated sewage was discharged directly into the River Weaver, causing widespread pollution.

Two swing bridges, Hayhurst Bridge built in 1898 and Town Bridge built in 1899, cross the Weaver at Northwich. The bridges were the first two electrically powered swing bridges in Great Britain and were built on floating pontoons to counteract the mine subsidence. They were designed by Colonel John Saner.

The Floatel Northwich was moored on the Weaver near the confluence of the two rivers, but was closed when the owners, The Real Hotel Company plc, went into administration in January 2009; it has since been removed. It was the UK&#x27;s only floating hotel.

==Transport==
===Water===
The key historical mode of transport was by water. By 1732, the River Weaver was improved from Frodsham Bridge to Winsford Bridge and eventually allowed vessels up to to travel up to Northwich Bridge. The Trent and Mersey Canal, opened in 1775, passed to the north of Northwich because of objections from the trustees of the Weaver Navigation. However, the canal passed salt deposits near to the village of Marston and many of the later salt mines were based along its banks including the Lion Salt Works. The Anderton Boat Lift was opened in 1875 to connect the canal and river systems. It was fully restored in 2002 and now houses a visitor centre.

===Roads===
The road system around Northwich can be dated back to the Roman times. The A556 and A559 follow the route of the Roman road that runs from Chester to York. The A556 diverts away from the route of the Roman road following a new route to the south of the town acting as the town&#x27;s bypass. The Chester to Manchester road became a Turnpike in 1769. 

The A530, known as King Street, also passes near to the town, and this follows the route of the Roman road that connected Warrington and Middlewich. The old route to Warrington and the north from Middlewich, however, was replaced by a new route through Knutsford, which became a turnpike in 1753. Northwich is connected to the motorway network to the north of the town via the A559 onto the M56 motorway; and to the east of the town via the A556 at junction 19 of the M6 motorway.

===Railway===
The railway came to the town in 1863, when the Cheshire Midland Railway constructed its line from . The West Cheshire Railway built its line to in 1869. Passenger trains from Northwich to , via commenced in 1875. The route through Northwich is now marketed as the Mid-Cheshire Line. 

Northwich railway station, last rebuilt in 1897, is a stop on the line between Chester, and ; Northern Trains operates a generally hourly service in each direction. Other nearby stations are at , also on the Mid-Cheshire line, and on the West Coast Main Line.

===Buses===
Bus routes are operated predominately by Warrington&#x27;s Own Buses and D&amp;G Bus, linking Northwich with Weaverham, Hartford, Crewe, Warrington, Kelsall and Chester.

Family-run coach company, Walker&#x27;s Coaches, was based in Anderton, before being taken over by Holmeswood Coaches, which still runs the Northwich depot.

==Education==
Northwich and its surroundings has a number of schools and colleges. Sir John Deane&#x27;s College is now a sixth form college, but was originally formed as a grammar school in 1557. The school was originally known as Witton Grammar School and was erected close to Witton Chapel. The school moved to its current location, to the south of the town, in 1907–08. The Grange School, Northwich is an independent school.

Primary schools include:
* The Grange Junior School
* Witton Church Walk CofE Primary School
* Victoria Road Primary School
* Charles Darwin Community Primary School
* Winnington Park Community Primary and Nursery School
* St Wilfrid&#x27;s Catholic Primary School
* Hartford Manor Primary School
* Hartford County Primary School
* Kingsmead Primary School was shortlisted for the Prime Minister&#x27;s Better Public Building award in 2005.
* Rosebank School is a school for autistic children aged 3–11 years.

During the 19th century, many new schools were founded and, by 1850, twelve academies were recorded in the area. The town is now served by County High School Leftwich, a specialist media arts college, while Rudheath Senior Academy, a specialist performing arts college and Hartford Church of England High School both admit pupils from Northwich. There are also several primary schools in the area. St. Nicholas Catholic High School is also in the local vicinity and performs well on national exam boards, coming second in the whole of Cheshire.

Mid Cheshire College had its main campus in nearby Hartford, offering further education courses. The campus closed in 2018 after it merged with Warrington Collegiate a year earlier to form Warrington and Vale Royal College. 

In November 2005, as part of the Northwich Vision, a refurbishment of the town&#x27;s railway station included a centre called &quot;Zone&quot; that promotes lifelong learning by offering people the opportunity to access a range of on-line and taught courses.

==Culture and community==
The town hosts a number of large annual festivals, including music, river and &quot;Pina Colada&quot; events.

Over the August Bank Holiday weekend, Northwich Festival is held at Moss Farm Sports Complex, featuring four days of music and sport. 

Since 2021, an annual Piña Colada Festival has taken place in recognition of Rupert Holmes who was born in the town and wrote &quot;Escape (The Piña Colada Song)&quot;, released in 1979. The festival grew in 2022, with live music, fairground rides and old school street games among other attractions. Local bars, restaurants and cafés offered piña coladas alongside other tropical themed drinks and snacks.

Northwich Memorial Hall was opened in 1960, but closed for redevelopment in 2013 to be replaced by the Memorial Court Facility; this opened in 2015. It hosted a range of activities, including pantomimes, music events and the Purple Cactus Comedy Club.

The Harlequin Theatre produces six plays each year and is also the home of Northwich Folk Club, which has run continuously since 1977.

The Regal cinema closed in 2007 and was demolished. A cinema in the Barons Quay development opened in 2016. Northwich Plaza also offered a wide range of music gigs and other cultural events.

Local newspaper, the &quot;Northwich Guardian&quot;, is published by Newsquest. Radio Northwich is a popular and community-focussed radio station broadcasting out of Barons Quay.

Northwich musicians include Steve Hewitt, drummer with Placebo, which provided a song for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, and Tim Burgess from the Charlatans, a band once managed by Steve Harrison from the town&#x27;s former Omega Music record store.

Local horror author Stuart Neild&#x27;s first novel, &quot;A Haunted Man&quot;, was set in the salt mines that run underneath Northwich, combining fact with supernatural fiction. Neild&#x27;s novels featuring Northwich and other North West locations. A Hollywood film and television series was in development.

The town is twinned with Dole in France.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. The town is served by both BBC Radio Merseyside and BBC Radio Stoke. Other radio stations include Capital North West &amp; Wales, Heart North West, Smooth North West, Greatest Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire, Silk Radio, and Radio Northwich, a community based local station. The local newspaper is the &quot;Northwich Guardian&quot;, which is published on Wednesdays.

==Sport==
Northwich is the home of three non-league football teams: Witton Albion, Northwich Victoria and 1874 Northwich. In May 2018, the Cheshire FA announced plans for a £70m development near Northwich, modelled on St George&#x27;s Park National Football Centre. The facility would include two FIFA-standard pitches with a 1000-seat stadium, 3G pitches, six grass pitches, full medical facilities and a hotel/spa.

The town has two rugby union sides: Northwich RUFC and Winnington Park.

The area also boasts several amateur cricket clubs, including Winnington Park CC, Davenham CC, Weaverham CC, Northwich CC and Hartford CC. Northwich also has a successful competitive swimming team, Northwich Swimming Club, first formed in the late 19th century.

Northwich Rowing Club was formed in 1875 in Northwich and continues to row on the River Weaver, producing Olympic and international rowers such as Matt Langridge. The club has its own boat and clubhouse located by The Crescent and holds three events every year, the Autumn Head in November, the Spring Head in April and the Regatta in May. In 2015, the club was the first rowing club from the north of England to win the Junior Coxed Quad Sculls at the Head of the River Fours on the tideway in London. Club crews have also competed in the Henley Royal Regatta, with a crew seeded in 2015 for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. The club also has a large junior section taking rowers on from age 12.

The Northwich Festival, held at Moss Farm Sports Complex each August includes the UK Strongman-North Competition.

The town also has a long-standing cycling club, Weaver Valley CC. Established in 1962, its members included ex-pro and ITV commentator Paul Sherwen and domestic rider Alan Kemp. The club competes in road racing, time trials, track racing and off-road. The club promotes three road races, a series of circuit races in June at Oulton Park, the Cat and Fiddle hill climb, and cyclo-cross in September. Since 1980, the club has promoted the Cheshire Classic women&#x27;s cycling road race, held every April. Part of British Cycling&#x27;s National Road Race Series, it is the longest running race on the women&#x27;s national calendar. Previous winners include Dame Sarah Storey, Lucy Garner, Lizzie Armitstead, Nicole Cooke and Mandy Jones.

The first known swimming baths in Northwich was the Verdin Baths, situated on Verdin Park, presented by Robert Verdin in commemoration of the Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. It consisted of a cast-iron plunge bath and five slipper baths. Northwich Public Baths was built in 1913 following subsidence at Verdin Park pool. It its doors on 23 January 1991 to be replaced with Moss Farm leisure complex; this, in turn, was replaced by Memorial Court entertainment and leisure venue in 2015.

<text>Rosmarie Waldrop (born Rosmarie Sebald; August 24, 1935) is an American poet, novelist, translator, essayist and publisher. Born in Germany, she has lived in the United States since 1958 and has settled in Providence, Rhode Island since the late 1960s. Waldrop is a co-editor and publisher of Burning Deck Press.

==Early life in Germany==
Waldrop was born in Kitzingen am Main on August 24, 1935. Her father, Joseph Sebald, taught physical education at the town&#x27;s high school. Towards the end of the Second World War, she joined a travelling theatre, but returned to school in early 1946. At school, she studied piano and flute and played in a youth orchestra. During Christmas in 1954, the orchestra gave a concert for American soldiers stationed at Kitzingen. After the performance, Keith Waldrop, a member of the audience, invited members of the orchestra to listen to his records. He and Rosmarie became friendly and worked together over the next few months, translating German poetry into English.

==University years==
That same year, she entered the University of Würzburg, where she studied literature, art history and musicology. In 1955, she transferred to the University of Freiburg, where she discovered the writings of Robert Musil and participated in a protest against a lecture given by Heidegger. She then moved to the University of Aix-Marseille, where Keith spent 1956–57 on his GI Bill. At the end of the year, he returned to the University of Michigan. In 1958, he won a Major Hopwood Prize, sending most of the money to Rosmarie to pay for her passage to the United States.

==In the United States==
The couple married and Rosmarie enrolled at the University of Michigan, where she received a Ph.D. in 1966. She also became active in literary, musical and artistic circles around the university and the wider Ann Arbor community. She began serious translation of French and German poetry. In 1961, the Waldrops bought a second-hand printing press and started &quot;Burning Deck Magazine&quot;. This was the beginning of Burning Deck, which was to become one of the most influential small press publishers of innovative poetry in the United States. As such, she is sometimes closely associated with the Language poets.

==Poetry and translations==
Rosmarie Waldrop started publishing her own poetry in English in the late 1960s. Since then, she has published over three dozen books of poetry, prose and translation. Today her work is variously characterized as verse experiment, philosophical statement and personal narrative. Of the many formative influences on her mature style, a crucial influence was a year spent in Paris in the early 1970s, where she came into contact with leading &quot;avant garde&quot; French poets, including Claude Royet-Journoud, Anne-Marie Albiach, and Edmond Jabès. These writers influenced her own work, while at the same time she and Keith became some of the main translators of their work into English, with Burning Deck one of the main vehicles for introducing their work to an English-language readership.

==Awards and honors==
Rosmarie Waldrop has given readings and published in many parts of Europe as well as the United States. She has received numerous awards and fellowships and was made a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the French government. In 2003 she was awarded a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts&#x27; Grants to Artists Award. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006. She received the 2008 PEN Award for Poetry in Translation for her translation of Ulf Stolterfoht&#x27;s book &quot;Lingos I - IX&quot;. Her translation of &quot;Almost 1 Book / Almost 1 Life&quot; by Elfriede Czurda was nominated for the Best Translated Book Award in 2013. She was given the America Award in Literature for a lifetime contribution to international writing in 2021.

<doc id="381991" wikidata="Q1235905" url="?curid=381991" title="Painswick">
<text>Painswick is a town and civil parish in the Stroud District in Gloucestershire, England. Originally the town grew from the wool trade, but it is now best known for its parish church&#x27;s yew trees and the local Rococo Garden. The village is mainly constructed of locally quarried Cotswold stone. Many of the buildings feature south-facing attic rooms once used as weavers&#x27; workshops.

Painswick stands on a hill overlooking one of the Five Valleys, between Stroud and Gloucester. It has narrow streets and traditional architecture. 

It has a cricket and rugby team and there is a golf course on the outskirts of the town. Painswick Beacon is in the nearby hills.

==History==

There is evidence of settlement in the area as long ago as the Iron Age. This can be seen in Kimsbury hill fort, a defensive earthwork on nearby Painswick Beacon, which has wide views across the Severn Vale. A Roman villa was built just to the north of the present village, dated by Welbore St Clair Baddeley to the late second century. The local monastery, Prinknash Abbey, was established in the 11th century. Painswick itself first appears in historical records in the Domesday Book of 1086, as &quot;Wiche&quot;, &#x27;dairy-farm&#x27;. It continues to appear by this name into the 13th century. The form &quot;Painswik&quot; first appears in 1237, but must originate in the name of an earlier lord of the manor, Pain Fitzjohn (d. 1137). &quot;Pain&quot; was a common Anglo-Norman name (itself originating in &quot;paiën&quot;, Latin &quot;paganus&quot;, &#x27;heathen&#x27;).

During the first English Civil War (1642–45) Gloucester was a Parliamentarian stronghold of some strategic importance, but it was surrounded by forces loyal to King Charles I. After the siege of Gloucester was broken on 5 September 1643, the Royalist army, which had been surrounding the city, encamped overnight at Painswick, with the king staying at Court House. Some damage was caused by the troops and a scar from two small cannonballs can still be seen on the tower of St. Mary&#x27;s parish church.

Painswick House dates from the 1730s and is the home of Baron Dickinson. Its Rococo Garden was laid out in the 1740s by Benjamin Hyett.

Gyde House, a prominent Edwardian Cotswold stone building overlooking the town, was formerly a children&#x27;s home called &quot;Gyde Orphanage&quot; or &quot;Gyde Home&quot;. The building started in 1913 with money bequeathed by a local man, Edwin Francis Gyde (1812 - 1894). The orphanage was designed by Percy Richard Morley Horder, and opened in 1919 to accommodate up to 70 children from ages 5 to 12. The home ran into financial difficulties in the 1930s and was taken over by the National Children&#x27;s Home charity (NCH). In 1987, Gyde House was offered for free to Coral Atkins, an English actress, for supporting children who had experienced severe abuse. The home closed in 1997 and was subsequently converted into apartments.

==Government==
For the purposes of local government, the civil parish of Painswick includes the neighbouring villages of Edge, Paradise, Sheepscombe and Slad. The civil parish forms part of the district of Stroud and the county of Gloucestershire. An electoral ward in the same name exists. This stretches beyond the confines of the civil parish. The total ward population taken at the 2011 Census was 4,158. Painswick Parish Council is based at Painswick Town Hall.

For parliamentary purposes, Painswick is within the UK constituency of Stroud. Prior to Brexit in 2020, it was in the European constituency of South West England.

==Parish church==

==Other churches and chapels==
==Local traditions==

On the first Sunday after 19 September, there has been an annual festival called &quot;Feast Sunday&quot;. Three customs were historically followed: feasting, drinking and disorderly conduct; clipping the church; and eating &quot;dog pie&quot;. The ceremony known as &quot;clipping the church&quot; involves mostly children, but also adults, who join hands, dance around and &quot;embrace&quot; St. Mary&#x27;s parish church. Clipping the church and eating dog pie are customs that have been revived and continue to be practised. The &quot;dog pie&quot; is not made of dog meat, but the custom is based upon plum pie baked with a porcelain china dog, that had been baked annually between 1870 and 1880.

Folklore holds that the churchyard will never have more than 99 yew trees and that should a 100th grow the Devil would pull it out. According to the Victoria and Albert Museum a count of the trees showed there to be 103. The plan of the churchyard included in the church&#x27;s own public leaflet shows 100.

While Royalists were encamped in Painswick, tradition has it that King Charles I went up to the Beacon and, seeing the beautiful valley to the east said &quot;This must be Paradise&quot;. Since then that valley, and the hamlet on its western side to the north of Painswick have been called Paradise.

During the 18th century a group of gentry, led by Benjamin Hyett II, organised an annual procession dedicated to Pan, during which a statue of the deity was held aloft, and people shouted &quot;Highgates! Highgates!&quot;. The tradition died out in the 1830s, but was revived in 1885 by the new vicar, W. H. Seddon, who mistakenly believed that the festival had been ancient in origin. Seddon&#x27;s successor, however, was less appreciative of the pagan festival and put an end to it in 1950, when he had Pan&#x27;s statue buried, although it was later dug up and placed within the grounds of Painswick House.

According to William Black&#x27;s &#x27;The Land that Thyme Forgot&#x27;, Bow Wow Sauce, a sauce to be served with roast meats, was developed in Painswick.

==Post office==

The post office in Painswick occupies a listed building built in 1478, making it the oldest known building in Great Britain to also contain a post office. It is not known when the post office counter was opened. Mr. H M Strange moved the post office up the street (by four buildings) in 1933 and remained Post Master there until retirement in 1968.

==School==
Painswick has one school, Croft Primary School. The school is a small secular and co-educational Community School for children aged 4 to 11 with fewer than 150 pupils. In the Key Stage 2 results for 2008 91% of children achieved or exceeded Level 4 in English and Science and 84% did so in Maths. These results are slightly higher than the county averages of 86%, 82% and 91% in English, Maths and Science respectively.

<text>Ross-on-Wye is a market town and civil parish in Herefordshire, England, near the border with Wales. It had a population estimated at 10,978 in 2021. It lies in south-east of the county, on the River Wye and on the northern edge of the Forest of Dean.

==History==

The name &quot;Ross&quot; is derived from the Welsh or Celtic for a &quot;promontory&quot;. It was renamed &quot;Ross-on-Wye&quot; in 1931 by the General Post Office, due to confusion with other places of the same or similar name (such as Ross in Scotland).

Ross-on-Wye promotes itself as &quot;the birthplace of British tourism&quot;. In 1745, the rector, Dr John Egerton, started taking friends on boat trips down the valley from his rectory at Ross. The Wye Valley&#x27;s attraction was its river scenery, its precipitous landscapes, and its castles and abbeys, which were accessible to seekers of the &quot;picturesque&quot;. In 1782, William Gilpin&#x27;s book &quot;Observations on the River Wye&quot; was published, the first illustrated tour guide to be published in Britain. Once it had appeared, demand grew so much that by 1808 there were eight boats making regular excursions along the Wye, most of them hired from inns in Ross and Monmouth. By 1850, more than 20 visitors had published their own accounts of the Wye Tour, and the area was established as a tourist destination.

===Parish church===

The 700-year-old Church of England parish church, St Mary&#x27;s, is the town&#x27;s most prominent landmark. Its tall pointed spire is visible when approaching the town from all directions. The church holds several distinctive tombs, one of which – that of William Rudhall (who died in 1530) – is one of the last great alabaster sculptures from the specialist masons of Nottingham, whose work was prized across medieval Europe. Rudhall was responsible for the repair of the almshouses to the north west of the church, in 1575. Another tomb is of John Kyrle, a prominent figure in 18th-century Ross, whose name has been taken by the town&#x27;s secondary school. He is also recalled in one of the town&#x27;s notable inns, &quot;The Man Of Ross&quot;, and there is a fine painting of him, by an unknown artist, in the Corn Exchange in the High Street.

===United Reformed, Methodist and Baptist churches===
The Methodist Church in Christ Church in Edde Cross Street has closed permanently. The United Reformed Church congregation, part of the Herefordshire Group, likewise was at Christ Church. The former United Reformed Church in Gloucester Road has now been converted into housing.

Ross Baptist Church is in Broad Street. In 1731 the Baptists built Ryeford Chapel at Weston under Penyard, but in 1817 worshippers from Ross decided to separate. They purchased the site on Broad Street and constructed a chapel with an attached graveyard. The original chapel was replaced in 1879, with much of the funding from Thomas Blake, a local philanthropist. In 2017, the current Baptist church in Ross marked its 200th anniversary.

===Plague Cross===

The Plague or Corpse Cross was erected in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s in 1637 as a memorial to 315 townsfolk who died that year of the plague and were buried nearby in a plague pit – at night and without coffins.

By 1896, the Plague Cross had fallen into disrepair and the top was missing. It was later restored. Since 1952, it has been listed as a Grade II* edifice, and since 1997 it has been a scheduled monument.

===The Prospect===
The Prospect was created by John Kyrle, who rented the land from the Marquess of Bath in 1696 and turned it into a garden and walkway. In 2008, heavy rain uncovered Roman remains that were excavated under the site.

The Prospect provides a public garden opposite the church, containing trees dedicated to local people, a VE Day Beacon and a War Memorial. It offers a view of the famous horseshoe bend in the Wye and as far west as the Black Mountains.

==Present day==

The town is known for locally owned shops and a market square with a market hall. Thursday and Saturday markets are held at the red sandstone Market House building in the town centre. This was built between 1650 and 1654 to replace a probably wooden Booth Hall. The upper storey now houses an arts and crafts centre.

The town&#x27;s small theatre, The Phoenix, shows films once a month, along with plays and other arts events.

The ruins of Wilton Castle, to the west of the town, have been restored and opened to visitors. The town has a number of sculptures by Walenty Pytel – the left bank of the Wye shows two of these. Despite the common belief that both depict swans, one in fact shows ducks.

==Politics and representation==
Most local government functions are vested in Herefordshire Council, the unitary authority covering the county. Ross Town Council, with 18 councillors, six each from the Ross North, West and East wards, has the powers of a parish council. The Mayor is Councillor Louis Stark. Ross Rural was merged into the civil parish on 1 April 2015. Since the May 2023 local elections, the town council has a majority of Liberal Democrats (twelve), with one Conservative and five Independents.

The town is part of the Hereford and South Herefordshire parliamentary constituency, currently represented in the House of Commons by the Conservative MP Jesse Norman.

==Transport==

The former Ross-on-Wye railway station was at a junction on the Hereford, Ross &amp; Gloucester Railway north of the town. It was the terminus of the Ross &amp; Monmouth Railway, which joined the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester just south of the station. Opened on 1 June 1855, the line was merged into the Great Western Railway on 29 July 1862 and in 1869 converted from broad gauge to standard gauge in a five-day period. A line to Tewkesbury was authorised by Parliament in 1856, but never built.

Under the Beeching cuts, the lines to Ross closed in stages up to 1964. The brick station has been demolished and the site redeveloped into an industrial estate, on which the brick goods and engine sheds still stand.

The nearest railway stations are in Ledbury on the Cotswold Line and Gloucester on the Birmingham &amp; Gloucester Railway.

Ross-on-Wye is a primary destination on Great Britain&#x27;s road network. The A40 road bypasses the town to its north and is signed westbound towards Monmouth, as well as eastbound towards Gloucester. It also interchanges with the northbound A49 to Hereford and the A449 running northeast to Ledbury. To the east is the end of the M50 motorway, sometimes called the Ross Spur or Ross Motorway, which links with the M5.

Stagecoach West and Nick Maddy Coaches provide regular bus services. Stagecoach West operates hourly route 33 through Ross between Gloucester and Hereford, while Nick Maddy Coaches operates hourly route 40 serving residential streets across town. National Express also operate a twice daily service to and from London on its 445 route.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Ridge Hill and the local relay transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Hereford and Worcester, Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire, Greatest Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire and Sunshine Radio.

The town is served by the local newspapers &quot;The Ross Gazette&quot; and &quot;Hereford Times&quot;.

==Climate==
Ross-on-Wye experiences a typically British maritime climate, with mild summers and winters. A Met Office weather station provides long-term climate data for the town. Meteorological readings have been taken in Ross since 1858; the Ross-on-Wye weather station holds some national records.

<doc id="381998" wikidata="Q578750" url="?curid=381998" title="Rothbury">
<text>Rothbury is a market town and civil parish in Northumberland, England, on the River Coquet. It is north-west of Morpeth and north of Newcastle upon Tyne. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 2,107.

Rothbury emerged as an important town because of its location at a crossroads over a ford on the River Coquet. Turnpike roads leading to Newcastle, Alnwick, Hexham and Morpeth allowed for an influx of families and the enlargement of the settlement during the Middle Ages. In 1291, Rothbury was chartered as a market town and became a centre for dealing in cattle and wool for the surrounding villages during the Early Modern Era. Later, Rothbury developed extensively in the Victorian era, due in large part to the railway and the industrialist Sir William Armstrong. Between 1862 and 1865, Armstrong built Cragside, a country house and &quot;shooting box&quot; (hunting lodge) just outside Rothbury, and extended it as a &quot;fairy palace&quot; between 1869 and 1900. The house and its estate are now owned by the National Trust and are open to the public, attracting many visitors to the area.

==History==
=== Prehistory and Ancient &quot;(Pre-500)&quot; ===
The area around Rothbury was populated during the prehistoric period, as evidenced by finds dating from the Mesolithic period and later, although all the known finds are from beyond the outer edges of the modern town. Sites include a cairnfield, standing stone and cup-marked rock on Debdon Moor to the north of the town, a well-preserved circular cairn some in diameter, a late Neolithic or Bronze Age standing stone, and an extensive hillfort, covering an area and associated cairnfield to the west of the town. No evidence of the Roman period has been found, probably because the town was a considerable distance north beyond Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

=== Saxons &quot;(500–1066)&quot; ===
Fragments from an Anglo-Saxon cross, possibly dating from the 9th century, are the only surviving relics pre-dating the Norman conquest. They were discovered in 1849, when part of the church was demolished, and in 1856. They are now in the town church and the University of Newcastle Museum.

=== Medieval &quot;(1066–1465)&quot; ===
The first documentary mention of Rothbury, according to a local history, was in around the year 1100, as &quot;Routhebiria&quot;, or &quot;Routha&#x27;s town&quot; (&quot;Hrotha&quot;, according to Beckensall). The village was retained as a Crown possession after the conquest, but in 1201 King John signed the Rothbury Town Charter and visited Rothbury four years later, when the rights and privileges of the manor of Rothbury were given to Robert Fitz Roger, the baron of Warkworth. Edward I visited the town in 1291, when Fitz Roger obtained a charter to authorise the holding of a market every Thursday, and a three-day annual fair near St Matthew&#x27;s Day, celebrated on 21 September.

Rothbury was not particularly significant at the time, with records from 1310 showing that it consisted of a house, a garden, a bakehouse and a watermill, all of which were leased to tenants. When the line of Fitz Roger died out, the town reverted to being a crown possession, but in 1334 Edward III gave it to Henry de Percy, who had been given the castle and baronry of Warkworth six years earlier. Despite the Scottish border wars, Rothbury rose in prosperity during the 14th century, and had become the town with the highest parochial value in Northumberland by 1535. Feuds still dominated local affairs, resulting in some parishioners failing to attend church because of them in the 16th century, and at other times, gathering in armed groups in separate parts of the building.

Rothbury became a relatively important town in Coquetdale, being a crossroads situated on a ford of the River Coquet, with turnpike roads leading to Newcastle upon Tyne, Alnwick, Hexham and Morpeth. After it was chartered as a market town in 1291, it became a centre for dealing in cattle and wool for the surrounding villages. A market cross was erected in 1722, but demolished in 1827. In the 1760s, according to Bishop Pococke, Rothbury also had a small craft industry, including hatters. At that time, the parish church&#x27;s vicarage and living was in the gift of the Bishop of Carlisle, and worth £500 per year.

=== Tudors and Stuarts &quot;(1465–1714)&quot; ===

==== Bernard Gilpin and the Border Reivers ====
Rothbury has had a turbulent and bloody history. In the 15th and 16th centuries the Coquet valley was a pillaging ground for bands of Reivers who attacked and burned the town with terrifying frequency. Hill farming has been a mainstay of the local economy for many generations. Names such as Armstrong, Charleton and Robson remain well represented in the farming community. Their forebears, members of the reiver &#x27;clans&#x27;, were in constant conflict with their Scots counterpart. The many fortified farms, known as bastle houses, are reminders of troubled times which lasted until the unification of the kingdoms of England and Scotland in 1603.

The theologian Bernard Gilpin, known as the &#x27;Apostle of the North&#x27; for his work in northern England during this period, visited Rothbury. While he preached a sermon, two rival gangs were threatening each other; realising they might start fighting, Gilpin stood between them asking them to reconcile – they agreed as long as Gilpin stayed in their presence. On another occasion, Gilpin observed a glove hanging in the church and asked the sexton about it. He was told it was a challenge to anyone who removed it. Gilpin thus took the glove and put it in his pocket and carried on with his sermon, and no-one challenged him. A painting of this incident by artist William Bell Scott is housed at Wallington Hall.

=== Georgians &quot;(1714–1837)&quot; ===
Near the town&#x27;s All Saints&#x27; Parish Church stands the doorway and site of the 17th-century Three Half Moons Inn, where the Jacobite rebel James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater stayed with his followers in 1715 prior to marching into a heavy defeat at the Battle of Preston in 1715.

On 16 June 1782, Methodist theologian John Wesley preached in Rothbury.

=== Victorians &quot;(1837–1901)&quot; ===
==== Cragside ====
Although Rothbury is of ancient origin, it mainly developed during the Victorian era. A factor in this development was industrialist Sir William Armstrong, later Lord Armstrong of Cragside, who built the country house, and &quot;shooting box&quot; (hunting lodge), of Cragside, between 1862 and 1865, then extended it as a &quot;fairy palace&quot; between 1869 and 1900. The house and its estate are now in the possession of the National Trust and are open to the public. 
==== 1884 royal visit ====
Another factor in Rothbury&#x27;s Victorian development was the arrival of the railway. Rothbury Station opened in 1870, bringing tourists on walking holidays to the surrounding hill country. This railway was most notably used by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and Princess Alexandra and their children (Albert Victor, 10, George &quot;later George V&quot;, 9, Louise, 7, Victoria, 6, Maud, 4), They arrived in Rothbury on 19 August 1884 and left on 22 August to visit Cragside and Lord Armstrong. Firework displays were held by Pain&#x27;s of London.

==== David Dippie Dixon ====
David Dippie Dixon was a historian from Rothbury. He previously worked in his father&#x27;s draper&#x27;s shop, William Dixon and Sons, set up in Coquetdale House. After William Dixon died, David Dippie Dixon and his brother John Turnbull Dixon renamed the shop Dixon Bros.

=== 21st century ===

==== 2006 royal visit ====

On 9 November 2006, Rothbury was visited by another Prince of Wales and future King, Edward VIII&#x27;s 2nd Great Grandson, Prince Charles, who is now the King of the United Kingdom. Charles visited his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, now Queen Consort. Charles visited to reopen the refurbished Rothbury village hall, Jubilee Hall, originally built in 1897 and named after the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, his 3rd Great Grandmother. The royal couple also visited Rothbury Family Butchers, whose owner, Morris Adamson, said:&quot;I talked to them for about 20 minutes about the business. It was almost surreal, staggering. They were both very well informed about the trade, and the Duchess really impressed me with her knowledge and enthusiasm. I put together for them a gift of Northumbrian lamb and specialist sausages and two days later they sent me a thank you letter from Clarence House saying how much they had enjoyed the visit and the meat. The Duchess told me in the shop that her son (Tom) was a food critic and she said she would recommend he should come up to see us in Rothbury to sample our speciality sausages. And Prince Charles congratulated us on keeping alive the traditions of the trade and providing meat that was sourced locally. He urged us to keep up the good work. It was amazing, really.&quot;

Rothbury&#x27;s Anglican parish church building – All Saints&#x27; Church – dates from circa 1850, largely replacing but in parts incorporating the fabric of a former Saxon edifice, including the chancel, the east wall of the south transept and the chancel arch. The church has a font with a stem or pedestal using a section of the Anglo-Saxon cross shaft, showing what is reputed to be the earliest carved representation in Great Britain of the Ascension of Christ.

The Anglo-Saxon cross is not to be confused with the market cross near the church, the current version of which was erected in 1902 and is known as &quot;St Armstrong&#x27;s Cross&quot; as it was paid for by Lady Armstrong, widow of Lord Armstrong of Cragside. Until 1965, Rothbury was the location of a racecourse, which had operated intermittently since April 1759, but seldom staged more than one meeting per year. The course was affected by flooding in the 1960s, and the last meeting was on 10 April 1965. The site is now used by Rothbury Golf Club.

Half a mile to the south, Whitton Tower is an exceptionally well-preserved 14th-century pele tower.

Lordenshaw Hill has an important concentration of rock carvings, amounting to over 100 panels in an area of less than 620 acres. Carved panels include cup-marked boulders and complex panels. Other archaeological sites in this area include an Iron Age enclosure and an Early Bronze Age cairn.

On the footpath to Thropton is a well preserved iron age Fort with three circular mounds around it. Nearby is a 4000 year old burial cairn.

== Crime ==
The following are notable crimes committed in or connected to Rothbury.

=== 1919 armed robbery of Rothbury Brewery ===
Dubbed by a newspaper as a &quot;Wild West Drama&quot;, on the night of 28 February 1919, an attempted armed robbery took place at the Rothbury Brewery. Two Russian sailors, Peter Klighe and Karl Strautin, broke into the Rothbury Brewery to rob it, however, at around 9:00 pm, patrol officer PC Francis Sinton was walking past the Brewery, and he approached it after hearing noises of breaking glass. As he did so he told a passer-by named James Curry to fetch the manager, Mr Farndale. As PC Sinton approached the brewery one of the two men appeared from it and shot at Sinton, missing him only slightly, and the two began to tussle as the second man appeared from the brewery and smashed Sinton&#x27;s head with an iron bar. Curry and Farndale arrived finding PC Sinton laying on the ground, Farnsdale struggled with one of the assailant, however he managed to fight Farnsdale off leaving Farnsdale with the assailant&#x27;s muffler scarf, with the assailant escaping with his accomplice. After an extensive police search around Northumberland, the two perpetrators Klighe and Strautin were found in Walbottle Dene. Despite being armed with a pistol they gave themselves up. Klighe and Strautin were found wearing clothes stolen from the Ashington Co-Op, where they also broke into the safe. They were suspected of breaking into a number of safes across the region. They were charged with four counts of burglary and attempted murder, being sentenced to penal servitude for 13 years before being deported. PC Sinton was awarded the Kings Police Medal for Gallantry.

=== 1993 armed robbery of the Rothbury Post Office ===
Overnight on 23 and 24 August 1993, Rothbury experienced another armed robbery. An organised crime gang robbed the Rothbury post office of £15,000 (about £30,000 in 2020 money) in cash, stamps and pension books. Armed with iron crowbars and dressed in camouflage and ski masks, the robbers cut the telephone wires, blocked the main road with a stolen council van, and threatened local residents.

The then MP for Rothbury, Liberal Democrat Alan Beith said the event showed rural communities like Rothbury needed extra police cover to fight organised crime. Detective Inspector John Hope, who led the investigation, stated that too much of focus on cities leads to organized crime moving to rural villages. He also said that improving roads to give better police access to rural villages would help decrease crime, and that the criminal justice system was failing to convict people, with criminals knowing they could escape punishment.

=== 2010 Northumbria police manhunt ===
In July 2010, Rothbury was the site of a major police manhunt. Raoul Moat was released from HM Prison Durham on 1 July, after an 18-week sentence for assaulting a nine-year-old relative. During his prison sentence, his girlfriend had a relationship with a police officer that she kept secret from Moat; his business also collapsed while he was in prison, for which he blamed the police. After his release, he discovered his girlfriend&#x27;s relationship; he shot and killed her new boyfriend, 29-year-old karate instructor Chris Brown, and attempted to kill her. Then, while driving on the A1, he attacked police officer David Rathband, stationed in a patrol car on the roundabout of the A1 and A69 roads near East Denton, permanently blinding him. (Rathband would hang himself at home in Blyth 18 months later.) Moat then went on the run for six days (3–9 July), hiding in and around Rothbury. Police then cornered him by the river on the night of 9 July. After a six-hour stand-off, with Moat holding a gun to his head the entire time, Moat committed suicide by shooting himself early on the morning of 10 July.

<text>Rye is a town and civil parish in the Rother district of East Sussex, England, from the sea at the confluence of three rivers: the Rother, the Tillingham and the Brede. An important member of the mediaeval Cinque Ports confederation, it was at the head of an embayment of the English Channel, and almost entirely surrounded by the sea.

At the 2011 census, Rye had a population of 4,773. Its historical association with the sea has included providing ships for the service of the Crown in time of war, and being involved in smuggling. The notorious Hawkhurst Gang used its ancient inns The Mermaid Inn and The Olde Bell Inn, which are said to be connected to each other by a secret passageway.

Those historic roots and its charm make it a tourist destination, with hotels, guest houses, B&amp;Bs, tea rooms, and restaurants. Rye has a small fishing fleet, and Rye Harbour has facilities for yachts and other vessels.

==History==
The name of Rye is believed to come from the West Saxon &quot;ieg&quot; meaning island. Medieval maps show that Rye was originally located on a huge embayment of the English Channel called the Rye Camber, which provided a safe anchorage and harbour. Probably as early as Roman times, Rye was important as a place of shipment and storage of iron from the Wealden iron industry.

Rye, as part of the Saxon Manor of Rameslie, was given to the Benedictine Abbey of Fécamp in Normandy by King Æthelred; it was to remain in Norman hands until 1247. The town of Rye is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as possessing 189 households, marking it as a significant settlement at the time. The cellars of the Mermaid Inn date from 1156.

As one of the two &quot;Antient Townes&quot; (Winchelsea being the other), Rye was to become a &quot;limb&quot; of the Cinque Ports Confederation by 1189, and subsequently a full member. The protection of the town as one of the Cinque Ports was very important, due to the commerce that trading brought. One of the oldest buildings in Rye is Ypres Tower, which was built in 1249 as &quot;Baddings Tower&quot;, to defend the town from the French, and was later named after its owner, John de Ypres. It is now part of the Rye Museum.

Rye received its charter from King Edward I in 1289, and acquired privileges and tax exemptions in return for ship-service for the crown. The &quot;Landgate&quot; (the only surviving one of four original fortified entrances to Rye) dates from 1329 in the early years of the reign of King Edward III. It is suitable only for light vehicles. In 2015, some 25 tonnes of pigeon excrement that had built up had to be removed from Landgate Arch for fear of damaging the ancient structure.

The River Rother originally took an easterly course to flow into the sea near what is now New Romney. However, the violent storms in the 13th century (particularly in 1250 and 1287) cut the town off from the sea, destroyed Old Winchelsea, and changed the course of the Rother. Then the sea and the river combined in about 1375 to destroy the eastern part of the town and ships began use the current area (the Strand) to unload their cargoes. Two years later, the town was sacked and burnt by the French, and it was ordered that the town walls be completed, as a defence against foreign raiders.

Rye was considered one of the finest of the Cinque Ports, though constant work had to be done to stop the gradual silting up of the river and the harbour. Also, a conflict arose between the maritime interests and the landowners, who gradually &quot;inned&quot; or reclaimed land from the sea on Romney and Walland Marsh, and thus reduced the tidal flows that were supposed to keep the harbour free of silt. Acts of Parliament had to be passed to enable the Rother to be kept navigable at all.

With the coming of bigger ships and larger deepwater ports, Rye&#x27;s economy began to decline, and fishing and particularly smuggling (including owling, the smuggling of wool) became more important. Imposition of taxes on goods had encouraged smuggling since 1301, but by the end of the 17th century, it became widespread throughout Kent and Sussex, with wool being the largest commodity. When luxury goods were also added, smuggling became a criminal pursuit, and groups – such as the Hawkhurst Gang who met in The Mermaid Inn in Rye – turned to murder and were subsequently hanged. In the 1500s, there was a small Huguenot community at Rye and neighbouring Winchelsea.

Since 1803, lifeboats have been stationed at Rye although the lifeboat station is now at Rye Harbour about downriver from the town. The worst disaster in RNLI history concerning a single vessel, and in the 20th century, occurred in 1928, when the lifeboat &quot;Mary Stanford&quot; sank with all hands; 17 men were drowned. The incident is recorded by a tablet at Winchelsea church, by the imposing memorial at Rye Harbour Church and by the folk song &quot;The &quot;Mary Stanford&quot; of Rye&quot;. A new &quot;Mary Stanford&quot; was commissioned by the RNLI two years later, and stationed at Ballycotton on the coast of Ireland. Since 2010, the RNLI has operated an Atlantic 85-class inshore lifeboat at Rye Harbour.

Between 1696 and 1948, six ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name .

During the 1803–1805 Napoleonic invasion threat, Rye, Dover, and Chatham were regarded as the three most likely invasion ports, and Rye became the western command centre for the Royal Military Canal. The canal was planned from Pett Level to Hythe, but was not completed until long after the threat had passed.
From 1838 to 1889, Rye had its own borough police force. It was a small force, often with just two officers. Rye police frequently had difficulties on Bonfire night (5 November) and special constables were recruited to help deal with the problems bonfire gangs caused. After amalgamation with the county force in 1889 a new police station was provided in Church Square. In 1892 the strength of the town police, now amalgamated, was one sergeant and three constables.

In May 1940, during the darkest days of World War II, the Rye fishing fleet was invited to participate in Operation Dynamo, the seaborne rescue of the stranded British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk, but refused to do so.

==Rye Royal==
Rye, being part of the Cinque Ports Confederation and a bastion against invasion on the Channel Coast, has always had close links with the crown. King Edward III and the Black Prince defeated the Spanish in Rye Bay in 1350 in the battle of Les Espagnols sur Mer, but Queen Elizabeth I gave the town the right to use the title &quot;Rye Royal&quot; following a visit in 1573. King Charles I described Rye as &quot;The cheapest sea-towne for the provision of fish for our house&quot;. George I whilst returning from visiting his continental possessions in 1726 was grounded on Camber Sands and spent the next four days in Rye, being accommodated at Lamb House.

==Governance==
Historically, Rye was an independent borough granted rights of governance under its charter of 1289, with its own appointed Mayor of Rye and chosen jurats (magistrates). These independent powers were terminated by the Local Government Act of 1972 and, although officially considered to be a rural parish, Rye&#x27;s governing body – because of its history – is that of a Town Council. That Council has one electoral ward, electing 16 members, one of whom then is elected mayor of Rye. In Rye Town Hall, the list of the mayors of Rye is unbroken going back to the 13th century. Two gruesome relics of Rye&#x27;s violent past include the gibbet cage which was famously used to display the hanged body of the murderer John Breads in 1742, and the pillory last used in 1813 in the case of a local publican who assisted the escape of the French General Armand Philippon.

Apart from the Town Council, the majority of local government functions are exercised by Rother District Council, with its headquarters in Bexhill-on-Sea, and East Sussex County Council, based in Lewes. The Rother District Council ward of Rye and Winchelsea returns two councillors. The East Sussex County Council division of Rye and Eastern Rother returns one councillor.

Since 1983, Rye has been part of the parliamentary constituency of Hastings and Rye, prior to which it had its own seat. The current Member of Parliament, since 2024, is Helena Dollimore of the Labour Party.

==Geography==

Rye stands at the point where the sandstone high land of the Weald reaches the coast. The medieval coastline (see map above), with its large bay, enabled ships to come up to the port. The original course of the River Rother then reached the sea at Romney to the northeast. Storms in the English Channel in the 13th century, coupled with reclamation of the bay, brought huge quantities of gravel through longshore drift along the coast, blocking the port entrance. The course of the river has also changed over the centuries so that Rye now stands on the river at the point of its confluence with the River Tillingham and the River Brede, whereas the river flows southward into Rye Bay. River Rother and the environs of Rye Harbour are managed and maintained by the Environment Agency. The Rivers Brede and Rother also form part of the Royal Military Canal between Winchelsea and Iden Lock. The town is part of the remotest and least populated area of southeastern England, on the edge of Romney Marsh and within 3 km of the coast.
A part of the town, but only a minority of the housing stock, lies on the original rocky heights (the Citadel) and contains the historic buildings including St Mary&#x27;s parish church, the Ypres Tower (part of the Town Wall), Lamb House and many of the houses on Mermaid Street, Watchbell Street, and Church Square. The main road skirts the town to the south after crossing the river; Winchelsea Road leads to New Winchelsea Road, formerly Royal Military Road, which runs parallel to the River Brede before leaving the town boundary. The houses along New Winchelsea Road date from the 1930s, built on the excavations from the Royal Military Canal. The gardens run down to the river, with fishing and boating rights. Most of Rye&#x27;s inhabitants live outside the Citadel area.

==Economy==
Rye, over the centuries, has successively been an &quot;entrepôt&quot; port, a naval base, a fishing port, an agricultural centre, and a market town. The old part of the town within the former town walls has shops, art galleries and restaurants. Additionally, Rye is known for oast houses in the surrounding villages and hamlets Many have been converted into private residences, however a few, like the Playden Oasts Inn, remain open to the public.

The great attractiveness of the town has kept it on the tourist trail, especially its &quot;perfect cobbled lanes, like Mermaid Street, which must be one of Britain&#x27;s most photographed&quot;. A 2020 report praised the medieval streets &quot;often wonky houses and it is easy to get lost in the town&#x27;s history&quot;. Camber Sands beach, &quot;with its moody sand dunes and long sandy beach&quot;, is nearby. The town and its surrounding areas were branded &quot;1066 country&quot; because of the historic aspects. Few statistics are published for Rye as a town, but an estimated one million visits were made in 2016.

Since the Second World War, the town has become a centre for ceramics. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected many East Sussex businesses in 2020–2021. East Sussex Council estimated in September 2020 that &quot;more than £45 million&quot; was expected to be &quot;injected into the county’s economy to aid recovery from the impact of Covid-19&quot;.

Apart from its tourist base, Rye continues to operate as a port. At Rye Harbour, the Rastrums Wharf (which was renovated in the 1980s) has the capacity to take large ships up to on a high tide.

Considerable investment has been made in facilities for both the fishing fleet berthed at Rye and the commercial wharves at Rye Harbour. Rye fishing boats are code-lettered RX (from &quot;Rye, Sussex&quot;; this registration is also used by the Hastings fishing fleet) and land fish daily. Some of the catch is sold at the quayside, though most is sold through the great regional market in Boulogne.

Rye also is an important yachting base, offering the only safe haven for many miles in either direction along this section of Channel coast. Yachts may currently moor either at Rye Harbour or at the Strand Quay at the edge of the town. Numerous plans have been proposed for a modern yacht marina to be built at Rye, but each has foundered on economic or planning grounds.

==Transport==
At the latter end of the 18th century, Rye was connected to the turnpike trust system of roads. One of these, the Flimwell Turnpike, took passengers towards London; the second ran from Hastings eastwards through the town. These two roads are now the A268 and the A259. The Monk Bretton Bridge over the Rother was built in 1893 and provided a link with Rye and New Romney via Brenzett. In the 1980s and 1990s, proposals to bypass the A259 route around Rye were met with local opposition and never received any priority in the building programme.

In addition to the half-hourly 100/101 Dover-Hastings Stagecoach long-distance bus service, buses connect Rye with other towns and villages, including Tenterden, Hastings, and Tunbridge Wells.

Rye railway station is on the Marshlink line between Hastings and Ashford. This now provides an hourly service from Eastbourne to Ashford International connecting with the high-speed Class 395 service to London St Pancras. Gatwick Airport may be reached by rail via Eastbourne or Lewes.

Before World War II, a summer steamship service ran from Rye to Boulogne. Rye was also the terminus for the prewar Rye &amp; Camber Tramway, built to serve golf courses and Camber Sands; it was closed to the public at the outbreak of World War II, never reopened, and scrapped in 1947.

Several long-distance footpaths can be joined by walkers in the town. The Saxon Shore Way which starts at Gravesend, Kent, and traces the coast as it was in Roman times, passes through Rye &quot;en route&quot; to Hastings; the 1066 Country Walk leads from Rye to Pevensey; the High Weald Landscape Trail goes to Horsham; and the Royal Military Canal Path follows that waterway to Hythe.

==Education==

Rye College (formerly called Thomas Peacocke Community College, and before that Thomas Peacocke School) is a secondary school in Rye. The two primary schools, Tilling Green Infant School and Freda Gardham Community School, were replaced by a new school, Rye Primary, adjacent to the secondary institution, in September 2008. The original Rye Primary School was situated just off Ferry Road near the railway crossing.

==Places of worship==

Past and present places of worship in Rye include St Mary&#x27;s, the Anglican parish church with Norman origins; St Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic church, rebuilt in 1929; a 1909 Baptist chapel in Cinque Ports Street, replacing the Rye Particular Baptist Chapel of 1754 (which itself stood on the site of an older Quaker meeting house); former Congregational and Independent churches; and a Methodist chapel.

==Amenities==
Rye is a local commercial centre for the Romney Marsh and Walland Marsh areas, as well as being a tourist spot. Rye Farmers&#x27; Market takes place on Strand Quay every Thursday morning. Rye has a well-established reputation as a centre for shops trading antiques, collectors&#x27; books, and records, and has many art galleries selling works by local artists and potters with changing exhibitions throughout the year.

Rye&#x27;s general weekly market takes place on the marketplace car park by the station every Thursday. Until the foot-and-mouth disease crisis in 2001 (which closed all livestock markets in England), livestock sales were held frequently at Rye.

Rye Castle Museum is located on two sites, on East Street and at the Ypres Castle. One of the tourist websites includes a picture tour of the town Rye Art Gallery was established as a Trust in the early 1960s. Located at 107 High Street and incorporating the former Ypres Studio in Ockmans Lane, home of artists Mary Stormont (1871–1962) and her husband Howard Gull Stormont (1859–1935), it provides a focus for contemporary visual art, which it exhibits alongside heritage artworks from its permanent collection.

Rye also stands at the centre of a network of nature reserves, some of national importance. The Rye Harbour SSSI lies to the south and includes the Rye Harbour Nature Reserve.
The neighbouring Pett Levels and Pools, and the Pannel Valley nature reserve are accessible via Winchelsea and Winchelsea Beach a few miles to the west, whilst Scotney Lake lies just off the Lydd road and the RSPB reserve at Dungeness lies a few miles further to the east with the Bird Observatory located in the old lighthouse.

The recent redevelopment of the Rye wharf for the RX fishing fleet has provided modern amenities for the landing and storage of fish. Most is sold wholesale through the regional market in Boulogne, though there is a trend for Rye to develop as a gastronomic centre in the style of Newquay or Padstow, featuring the use of fresh local produce from the sea. The annual &quot;Rye Bay Scallop Festival&quot; which takes place each year in February was first proposed by the then Chair of the Chamber of Commerce, Kate Roy, as a means of promoting the &quot;Rye Bay Catch&quot;.

Every year in September, Rye hosts its annual two-week Arts Festival which attracts a world-class series of performers in music, comedy, and literature.

On the second Saturday after 5 November, the &quot;Bonfire Boys&quot; stage the annual Rye Bonfire featuring a torch-lit parade through the streets of the town, supported by visiting Bonfire Societies from all over the Sussex Bonfire Societies Confederation. This is followed by a &quot;gurt &#x27;normous bonfire&quot; where the chosen &quot;effigy&quot; of the year is ceremoniously blown up, and a spectacular firework display. This event typically attracts over 10,000 visitors to the town, and results in the town&#x27;s roads, and the main roads to London, Hastings, and Ashford, being clogged up and closed to traffic from the early evening onwards.

==Local media==

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Dover and the local relay transmitters.

Rye’s local radio stations are BBC Radio Sussex on 104.5 FM, Heart South on 102 FM and a community radio station which launched on FM on 7 March 2022 and is called Cinque Ports Radio on 95.1FM. This station broadcasts across Romney Marsh and Hythe on 100.2FM and on 95.1FM across Rye, Winchelsea and surrounding areas. Cinque Ports Radio replaced Shoreline FM 100.2 which broadcast since January 2020. Shoreline FM now being an online only service for Rye, Romney Marsh and Hythe called Shoreline Easy.

The town’s local newspaper is &quot;Rye News&quot;.

==Sports==
Rye has a non-League football club, Rye Town FC, who play their home matches at The Salts. The club, which was formed in 2016, plays in the East Sussex Football League, and replaced the now defunct Rye United FC (formerly Rye &amp; Iden United) of the Sussex County Football League, which folded in 2014. Rye has a rugby union club, Rye RFC, who compete in the Sussex 2 league. The club was formed in 1991 and field both adult and youth teams.

==Rye in literature and film==
Several mentions of the &quot;small English seaport&quot; were made by travel writers between the 16th and 18th centuries. Among them, Daniel Defoe described the state of the harbour and its approaches, believing that &quot;Rye would flourish again, if her harbour, which was once able to receive the royal navy, cou&#x27;d be restor&#x27;d&quot;, but thought it very doubtful that large ships would be able to use the port again.

Rye has also produced and attracted many writers, some of whom lived at Lamb House which is one of the town&#x27;s most notable historic residences and now owned by the National Trust. Residents have included Henry James, who lived there between 1898 and 1916, and E. F. Benson. Others who lived in the area include Joseph Conrad; Ford Madox Ford; Stephen Crane; Rumer Godden and the naturalist W. H. Hudson. H. G. Wells, Lytton Strachey and Virginia Woolf were also visitors to Rye. 

Lamb House and the town of Rye feature prominently in Benson&#x27;s &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot; novels, as &quot;Mallards House&quot; and &quot;Tilling&quot;, respectively. In the mid-1980s, Rye was used as a location by LWT in its adaptation of the novels. Later a BBC adaptation of &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot; was filmed in Rye in the summer of 2014. And in May 1958 the author Georgette Heyer spent some time in the town, researching background for several scenes for what became her novel The Unknown Ajax, set in 1817. 

==The artistic connection==
The town and its striking surroundings have frequently served as subject for painters, many of whose works are now on display in its art gallery. One of the earliest topographical panoramas, dating from the 17th century when the town was still an island port, is in the style of Hendrick Danckerts and on display in Rye Castle Museum. Later landscapists who recorded views of the town have included Thomas Girtin, William Daniell, and J. M. W. Turner. During the 20th century, the harbour and its marshy surroundings were a particular draw for such artists as Paul Nash, Eric Ravilious and John Piper. In addition, Edward Burra lived near Rye and frequently painted its marshy surroundings, buildings in the town and even local characters.

<text>Tavistock ( ) is an ancient stannary and market town and civil parish in the West Devon district, in the county of Devon, England. It is situated on the River Tavy, from which its name derives. At the 2011 census, the three electoral wards (North, South and South West) had a population of 13,028. The town traces its recorded history back to at least 961 when Tavistock Abbey, whose ruins lie in the centre of the town, was founded. Its most famous son is Sir Francis Drake.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
The area around Tavistock (formerly Tavistoke), where the River Tavy runs wide and shallow allowing it to be easily crossed, and near the secure high ground of Dartmoor, was inhabited long before historical records. The surrounding area is littered with archaeological remains from the Bronze and Iron Ages.

The abbey of Saint Mary and Saint Rumon was founded in 961 by Ordgar, Earl of Devon. After destruction by Danish raiders in 997 it was restored, and at the time of the Conquest ranked as the wealthiest house in Devon, including the hundred and manor of Tavistock among its possessions. Among its famous abbots was Aldred, who crowned Harold II and William I, and died Archbishop of York.

In 1105 a royal charter was granted by Henry I to the monks of Tavistock to run a weekly &quot;Pannier Market&quot; (so called after the baskets used to carry goods) on a Friday, which still takes place today. In 1116 a three-day fair was also granted to mark the feast of Saint Rumon, another tradition that is still maintained in the shape of the annual &quot;Goosey&quot; fair on the second Wednesday in October.
By 1185 Tavistock had achieved borough status, and in 1295 it became a parliamentary borough, sending two members to parliament. The abbey church was rebuilt in 1285. In 1305, with the growing importance of the area as one of Europe&#x27;s richest sources of tin, Tavistock was one of the four stannary towns appointed by charter of Edward I, where tin was stamped and weighed and monthly courts were held for the regulation of mining affairs.

====Parish church====
The St Eustachius&#x27; Church (named after the Roman centurion who became a Christian) was dedicated by Bishop Stapledon in 1318 though there are very few remains of that building today. It was rebuilt and enlarged into its current form between 1350 and 1450, at which time the Clothworkers&#x27; Aisle (an outer south aisle) was included, an indication of the growing importance of the textile industry to the local economy—the trade was protected by a 1467 statute. The whole is in the Perpendicular style and consists of a nave and chancel; both with two aisles, tower and outer south aisle.

It possesses a lofty tower supported on four open arches, one of which was reputedly added to accommodate the 19th-century &quot;tinners&quot; or tin miners. Within are monuments to the Glanville and Bourchier families, besides some fine stained glass, one window being the work of William Morris and another of Charles Eamer Kempe. It also has a roof boss featuring one of the so-called &#x27;Tinners&#x27; Hares&#x27;, a trio of rabbits/hares joined at and sharing three ears between them. The font is octagonal and dates from the 15th century.

===Early modern period===
The greater part of the abbey was rebuilt in 1457–1458. The town continued to prosper in the charge of the abbots, acquiring one of England&#x27;s first printing presses in 1525. Tavistock remained an important centre of both trade and religion until the dissolution of the monasteries—the abbey was demolished in 1539, leaving the ruins still to be seen around the centre of the town. From that time on, the dominant force in the town became the Russell family, Earls and later Dukes of Bedford, who took over much of the land following the Dissolution. In 1552 two fairs on 23 April and 28 November were granted by Edward VI to the Earl of Bedford, then lord of the manor.

In the 17th century great quantities of cloth were sold at the Friday market, and four fairs were held at the feasts of Saint Michael, Epiphany, Saint Mark, and the Decollation of John the Baptist. The charter of Charles II instituted a Tuesday market, and fairs on the Thursday after Whitsunday and at the feast of Saint Swithin.

Tavistock is tied from late medieval times with the Russells, the family name of the Earls of Bedford and since 1694, the Dukes of Bedford. This is clearly seen from the history of the town. The second title of the Duke of Bedford is the Marquess of Tavistock, taken as the courtesy title of the eldest son and heir to the dukedom, and illustrates the importance of this Devon town, its hinterland and the minerals beneath it to the family&#x27;s fortunes. It is believed that the Russell family retains considerable interests in the locality. Most recently, Robin, the short-lived 14th Duke, as Marquess of Tavistock, was a frequent visitor to the town along with his wife, Henrietta. Andrew Russell is the 15th Duke of Bedford and Marquess of Tavistock.

It is this Russell family connection through the Bedford Estates which gives the name by ownership to Russell Square and Tavistock Square in London, famously home to the Tavistock Clinic, and the bus-bombing of 7 July 2005.

====Francis Drake====
Around 1540 (some sources state 1542 as the exact year), Sir Francis Drake was born at Crowndale Farm, just to the west of what is now Tavistock College. A Blue Plaque is mounted on the current farmhouse, behind which Drake is believed to have been born, the original farmhouse having been dismantled and the stone transported for use in Lew Trenchard. He became a prominent figure of his age, a champion of Queen Elizabeth, the first Englishman to circumnavigate the world from 1577 to 1580 and one of the English commanders in the victory against the Spanish Armada in 1588.

The famous statue of Drake on Plymouth Hoe is a copy of that on a roundabout on the A386 at the western end of the town, with panels not replicated on the Hoe copy. Drake later made his home at Buckland Abbey, about away towards Plymouth, jointly owned/run by Plymouth City Council and the National Trust, and now a museum to Drake.

====Industry====
Mines of copper, manganese, lead, silver and tin were previously in the neighbourhood and the town played host to a considerable trade of cattle and corn, and industries in brewing and iron-founding.

By the 17th century, tin mining was on the wane and the town relied more heavily on the cloth trade. Under the stewardship of the Russells the town remained prosperous, surviving the Black Death in 1625 (though 52 townspeople died).

==== English Civil War ====
In the English Civil War starting 1642, the town was at first held by the Parliamentarians (Francis Russell, the 4th Earl of Bedford was a leading figure in the parliamentarian movement), before later hosting King Charles I and his Royalist troops in 1643 after the defeat of the Parliamentary forces at the Battle of Bradock Down. The town was recaptured by the Parliamentarian New Model Army following the end of the Siege of Plymouth in 1646.

In 1694, William Russell, 5th Earl of Bedford became the first Duke of Bedford.

===Late modern period===

By 1800, cloth was heading the same way as tin had done a century earlier, but copper was starting to be copiously mined in the area, to such an extent that by 1817 the Tavistock Canal had been dug (most of the labour being performed by French prisoners of war from the Napoleonic Wars) to carry copper to Morwellham Quay on the River Tamar, where it could be loaded into sailing ships. In 1822 the old fairs were abolished in favour of six fairs on the second Wednesday in May, July, September, October, November and December.

In the mid-19th century, with nearby Devon Great Consols mine at Blanchdown one of the biggest copper mining operations in the world, Tavistock was booming again, reputedly earning the 7th Duke of Bedford alone over £2,000,000. A statue in copper of the 7th Duke stands in Guildhall Square. The Duke built a 50,000 imperial gallon (230 m3) reservoir to supply the town in 1845, as well as a hundred miners&#x27; houses at the southern end of town, between 1845 and 1855. There is a strong, recognisable vernacular &quot;Bedford style&quot; of design, exemplified most strikingly in Tavistock Town Hall and &quot;Bedford Cottages&quot; ubiquitous across Tavistock and much of the local area to the north and west, where the Bedfords had their estate and summer &quot;cottage&quot; at Endsleigh House and Gardens, which since 2005 is the Hotel Endsleigh run by Alex Polizzi.

Tavistock was deprived of one member of Parliament in 1867 and finally disenfranchised in 1885. The railway came to the town in 1859, with connections to the Great Western Railway and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR). At around this time the centre of town was substantially and ruthlessly remodelled by the 7th Duke of Bedford, including the construction of the current town hall and Pannier Market buildings, and the widening of the Abbey Bridge, first built in 1764, and a new Drake Road ramped up northwards from Bedford Square to the LSWR station. Tavistock North railway station opened to much acclaim and fanfare in 1890. The population had peaked at around 9,000. By 1901 the population had halved, recorded as 4,728. In 1968, following the Beeching Report, Tavistock Station closed, and in 1999 English Heritage listed the building as Grade II.

Kelly College, a co-educational public school, to the north-east of the town, was founded by Admiral Benedictus Marwood Kelly, and opened in 1877 for the education of his descendants and the orphan sons of naval officers, and is a pastiche of the Bedford and High Victorian styles of building. It later amalgamated with Mount House to form Mount Kelly Foundation.

====Early 20th and 21st centuries====
In 1911, the Bedford influence on the town came to an end after over 450 years, when the family sold most of their holdings in the area to meet death duties.

West Devon Borough Council is based in Tavistock, about 500 metres north of Bedford Square at Kilworthy Park. There was a small police station under part of the Bedford building complex on Bedford Square; this has closed and a new one is in Abbey Rise. The adjacent historic Magistrates Court has also closed and the nearest criminal court is now at Plymouth Law Courts.

In 1926 a meeting was held in Tavistock with representatives of the UK government and UK scientific instrument makers. A comparison was made on Dartmoor between UK theodolites and their European competition, especially the Swiss Wild T2 theodolite. One result of this conference was the 1930 &quot;Tavistock&quot; theodolite by Cooke, Troughton &amp; Simms.

In 1933 the long-disused canal was put to use providing hydroelectric power for the area.

A war memorial in Bedford Square commemorates the townsfolk killed in the First and Second World Wars. Many families across Britain exercised their right not to have their family members named on these public memorials. In 2006 it was planned to move the monument to a site in the graveyard of the Parish Church, but due to local opposition this did not happen.

==== World War 2 ====
In May 1943, parts of the American 29th Infantry division were stationed in Tavistock, as well as other areas of the South West. From 1944 there were a number of high ranking visits to the division, including that of Dwight D. Eisenhower, in February of that year, and Army Lieutenant General Omar Bradley.

The stationed division then left the town in May 1944 to be involved in the Omaha Beach landings part of Operation Overlord.

==== Later 20th and 21st centuries ====

Tavistock had two railway stations, both now closed. Tavistock South was the Great Western Railway&#x27;s station, on the route between Launceston and Plymouth. This was closed and mostly dismantled between 1962 and 1965. The station was sited to the south of Bedford Square, just over the bridge and to the right—now a council depot: no trace of the station remains. Tavistock North was the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway&#x27;s station, operated by the London and South Western Railway, on the route between Lydford and Plymouth via Bere Alston. This opened on 2 June 1890 and closed on 6 May 1968. The main station building survives as railway-themed bed and breakfast accommodation while the extensive goods yard is now known as Kilworthy Park and houses the offices of West Devon Borough Council. The railway for around a mile south of Tavistock North station is open to the public as a footpath and nature reserve and one can walk across the viaducts that overlook the town.

The trackbed of the Tavistock North route is almost intact to Bere Alston, where it joins today&#x27;s Tamar Valley Line. The possible re-opening of a rail link has been discussed for a number of years. Engineering assessment shows the rail-bed, bridges and tunnels to be in sound condition. In 2008 a housing developer offered to rebuild the railway to Bere Alston (from a new station slightly south of the town) if they were allowed to build 800 properties. This has also encouraged speculation about restoring the Tavistock-Okehampton rail link, which could provide an alternative to the Devon coastal main line to link the South West Region with the rest of the country. In December 2010 the developer published an update on the possibility of reinstating the line between Tavistock and Bere Alston and hence providing a train service between Tavistock and Plymouth. In April 2010 the Liberal Democrats had suggested that a Tavistock-Plymouth service could be included in the rail expansion plans should they win the 2010 General Election.

In 1986, the town&#x27;s two newspapers, the Tavistock Gazette (founded in 1857) and the Tavistock Times (established in 1920) merged to form the current weekly publication, the Tavistock Times Gazette, with a circulation of around 8,000. The newspaper is owned by Tindle Newspaper Group. The newspaper celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2007, with a visit from the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall.

In July 2006 Tavistock was named the eastern Gateway to the Cornish Mining World Heritage Site, which runs westward through the Tamar Valley and Great Consols Mine, down the spine of Cornwall to Lands End. This £75 million project is likely to bring more tourists to Tavistock. There has been no progress with proposals for a £1.1 million World Heritage Site Interpretation Centre, planned for 2007, to be built in the area of the Guildhall, and overlooking the River Tavy.

A local community group known as &quot;Tavistock Forward&quot; have been negotiating to take over the Guildhall complex with police and English Heritage endorsement, with leaseback of the existing police station to Devon &amp; Cornwall Police, while developing the Guildhall itself.

==Geography==
Tavistock lies on the edge of Dartmoor, around north of Plymouth on the A386, with a population of 11,018. The town is centred on the paved amenity of Bedford Square, around which are found St. Eustachius&#x27; Church and the abbey ruins, to the west, the Grade 2-listed town hall, the disused former Guildhall/magistrates&#x27; court buildings, and Pannier Market buildings behind the town hall. Abbey Bridge crosses the River Tavy to the south, while West Street and Duke Street, on either side of the north end of the square, form the main shopping areas, with the indoor [Pannier] market running behind Duke Street.

Plymouth Road, the A386 heading west from the centre of the square, is home to much of the town&#x27;s tourist trade, with many hotels and bed and breakfast establishments, as well as the town&#x27;s bus station. Between Plymouth Road and the Tavy is the park, known locally as the Meadows, along with car parks, the Wharf theatre, cinema and culture centre, and a public recreation pool. West of the Meadows are found the substantial playing fields and buildings of Tavistock College, reached by an underpass below the A386. Further south along the Plymouth Road/A386 lie industrial estates, supermarkets and other large retail outlets. To the north and east of town lies Whitchurch Down, where Dartmoor begins immediately.

===Climate===
Tavistock has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;).

==Religious sites==
* See also Tavistock Abbey
* For the parish church of St Eustachius, see above, Parish church
* The Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Assumption and St Mary Magdalene, Fitzford, was built at the expense of the Duke of Bedford in 1867. It is an ambitious building in the neo-transitional style and the tall spire is conspicuous from the high ground surrounding the town. This church was intended as a place of worship for miners. It fell into disuse and was bought in 1952 for use as a Roman Catholic church.

==Education==
===State===
Most secondary education is provided by Tavistock College, a state-funded specialist Language College with approximately 2,000 pupils, drawn from a catchment area of about radius. The college has links with Japan, Uganda, Spain and India where staff exchanges and student visits and projects take place.

Some children who pass the optional Eleven-Plus exam at a high level travel to one of the three remaining grammar schools in Plymouth. Others who leave school at 16 attend the City College C of F E there. Tavistock has a choice of primary schools: Church of England St Peter&#x27;s and also St Rumon&#x27;s, together with Devon County Council&#x27;s Tavistock Community Primary and Whitchurch Primary.

===Independent===
Mount Kelly School is the independent school in Tavistock. It has two main sites, the college which is situated on Parkwood Road and the Preparatory School which is situated on Mount Tavy Road. The school has 570 pupils between the ages of 3 and 18. Mount Kelly was formed in 2014 after two independent schools, Kelly College and Mount House School merged.

==Life and events==

===Market village and shopping centre===
Tavistock remains a small market town, providing shopping and entertainment for its residents, many small outlying villages and the local farming community. The town is now a centre for the West Devon and Dartmoor tourist trade. It is a fast-growing dormitory area for commuters working in Plymouth and has a sizeable retired population, perhaps drawn by the rural tranquillity and scenery, giving Tavistock an average resident age of 43.

Markets were originally held in Bank Square. A specialist Corn Market was erected on the corner of West Street and King Street in 1835. The main market continues to operate in the large covered market building, the Pannier Market, completed in 1860; the main market is on Fridays, on other days the market hosts specialised events, such as craft fairs and antiques fairs. A Farmers&#x27; Market takes place in the Square fortnightly and has been voted Best Farmer&#x27;s Market in the South West.

In 2005 Tavistock was voted &#x27;Best Market Town&#x27; in England and in 2006 &#x27;Best Food Town&#x27;, largely on the strength of the many independent food shops and suppliers in the town and nearby, such as a long-established family grocer and delicatessen in Brook St and the cheese shop behind the Pannier market. The town also became Devon&#x27;s second Fairtrade Town (in 2006). In 2006 the town was in the news for having successfully cold-shouldered to closure the local branch of McDonald&#x27;s.

===Events===
The biggest event in the town&#x27;s calendar is the annual Tavistock Goose Fair (known locally as the &quot;Goosey Fair&quot;) which has existed since 1116. It occurs on the second Wednesday of October, and takes over much of the town for several days either side, drawing crowds which far outnumber the resident population. Traditionally, the Fair was an opportunity to buy a Christmas goose, with plenty of time to fatten the bird before Christmas; nowadays, along with a multitude of gypsy street vendors selling a vast range of wares, there are all the rides and games associated with funfairs, such as fortune tellers.

There is an annual two-day garden festival held on the Spring Bank Holiday weekend and a carnival with a two-day Balloon Fiesta each August bank holiday weekend. In May there is an annual Tavistock Music &amp; Arts Festival.

In 2010, the town was chosen to be a stage depart town in the Tour of Britain cycle race.

On the first Sunday in October, the annual Abbots Way Walk finishes in Tavistock. Started in 1962, this challenge walk starts at Buckfast Abbey and participants walk across Southern Dartmoor to finish at Tavistock.

<text>Thetford is a market town and civil parish in the Breckland District of Norfolk, England. It is on the A11 road between Norwich and London, just east of Thetford Forest. The civil parish, covering an area of , in 2011 had a population of 24,340.

There has been a settlement at Thetford since the Iron Age, and parts of the town predate the Norman Conquest; Thetford Castle was established shortly thereafter. Roger Bigod founded the Cluniac Priory of St Mary in 1104, which became the largest and most important religious institution in Thetford. The town was badly hit by the Dissolution of the Monasteries, including the castle&#x27;s destruction, but was rebuilt in 1574 when Elizabeth I established a town charter. After World War II, Thetford became an &quot;overspill town&quot;, taking people from London, as a result of which its population increased substantially.

Thetford railway station is located on the Breckland line and is one of the best surviving pieces of 19th-century railway architecture in East Anglia.

==Name==
The origin of the name Thetford is unclear. The site was an important crossing of the River Little Ouse, so one possibility is that the settlement drew its name from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Theod&quot;ford or &quot;people&#x27;s&quot; ford. It is also unclear if the nearby River Thet is named after the crossing or the later settlement.

==History==
===Early history===
Breckland was used as an excavation site for flint tools around 2000 BC. During the Iron Age, a fort was established on Icknield Way at the site of Thetford Castle. Thetford was an important tribal centre for the Iceni during the late Iron Age and early Roman period, with Castle Hill and Gallows Hill being sites of particular note. During the Saxon period it was the principal centre of the eastern Heptarchy and a regular battle site between locals and the Viking invaders.

A mint was built in Thetford in the 9th century. There is evidence of coins minted in Thetford from the time of King Canute to the reign of King John. A monastery was established around 1020 and a grammar school was operating since before the Norman Conquest of 1066. The town greatly prospered during the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042–1066), and at one point there were 944 free Burgesses living in Thetford. The Domesday Book of 1086 estimated the population of Thetford to have grown to between 4000 and 4500 people, which would have been the sixth largest town in Britain at the time. The Book lists William of Bello Fargo as the Bishop of Thetford at the time. The bishopric had moved here from North Elmham in 1071 and stayed in Thetford until moving to Norwich in 1096.

In 1067–1069, Thetford Castle was built on the ruins of an Iron Age fort at Castle Hill. It is believed to have been constructed either by Ralph Guader, Earl of East Anglia, or Roger Bigod, his successor as Earl, who is known to have ordered Bungay and Framlingham castles to have been built in Suffolk. In 1104, Bigod founded the Cluniac Priory of St Mary. The priory grew rapidly, with an influx of monks from Lewes, and in 1107 it was moved to a larger site on the other side of the river where the ruins remain today. It became the largest and most important religious institution in Thetford.

The Norfolk Lent Assizes were held at Thetford from 1264 because there was only one Assize for both Norfolk and Suffolk. Thetford, being close to the border between the two, was convenient for both. However, after much pressure, an Act of Parliament was passed in 1832 to transfer them to Norwich. In 1373, John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster, was responsible for altering the administrative makeup of the town, promoting the mayor to its most important official, subjecting the bailiff and the coroner to report to him. Thetford had its own coroner, courts and legal officials, without depending on those for the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.

===Tudor history to present===

Henry VIII sent Anne Boleyn&#x27;s father, Thomas, as part of a Commission to assess Thetford in 1527. The Commission concluded that the town had fallen into &quot;great ruin and decay&quot; and that the burgesses of the town had squandered rents and dues which belonged to the King. Thetford was struck hard by the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s and 1540s. A formal complaint was raised by the mayors and burgesses to Thomas Cromwell in 1539, arguing that many of the town&#x27;s inhabitants would fall into extreme poverty because their livelihoods depended on pilgrims visiting Thetford. Thetford Priory was closed down in 1540 and fell into the possession of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. In 1574, Elizabeth I granted a Charter of Incorporation to the town, setting up a governing body of a mayor, ten burgesses and twenty commoners to meet in the Guildhall and redevelop the town main streets, houses and shops. Elizabeth arrived in Thetford on 27 August 1578 to survey developments, holding a Privy Council meeting at Sir Edward Clere&#x27;s Place House, now Nunnery Place. A lot of material from the decaying priory and religious buildings in the town were used to save building costs in the building of King&#x27;s House and other buildings in Thetford.

James VI and I visited Thetford, and in 1609 bought a house near St Peter&#x27;s churchyard from Sir William Barwick, still known as the King&#x27;s House. The house was rebuilt and extended for the king with a &quot;treble roof&quot; of three gables. Charles I granted the house to his Master Falconer, Andrew Pitcairns.

In 1819 there was a local desire to develop Thetford into a spa town modelled on Bath, Cheltenham and Harrogate. A pump room was built over the spring at Nuns Bridges and the Thetford Mineral Spring Company was established. The mayor financed a new gravel path along the bank of the Little Ouse, which was named Spring Walk. The plan did not succeed; by 1838 the pump room was closed. In 1835 the old Corporation of Thetford was abolished, and a new one set up a mayor, four aldermen and twelve councillors. The town was represented by two MPs until 1868 when it lost a seat to Scotland.

Dr Allan Glaisyer Minns, born in Inagua, the Bahamas, became the first black man to become a mayor in Britain when he was elected as Mayor of Thetford in 1904.

In 1912, more than 30,000 troops participated in military manoeuvres on the heath land outside the town. Over 700 men from the town fought in World War I; a memorial was erected in 1921 with the names of over 100 men who died during the war. Locally in the wooded and sand like areas, the trial tests of the first tank took place in total secrecy in early 1915. At the end of World War II, Thetford still only had a population of around 5000 people. In the 1950s, the borough council drew up a plan with the London County Council to relocate Londoners and several businesses to Thetford and double the population. By the late 1980s the population of Thetford had reached around 21,000 people. This meant that Thetford grew faster than any other town in Norfolk.

==Geography==

Thetford is situated in the south of Norfolk, close to the county boundary with Suffolk. By road it is northeast of Cambridge and southwest of Norwich. It lies on the River Little Ouse. On the western side of Thetford is Thetford Forest, which is heavily forested with pine trees. Brettenham Heath National Nature Reserve is to the northeast, near the hamlet of Roudham. To the southeast of Thetford is Nunnery Lakes Nature Reserve, covering about 200 acres, with breckland heath, woodland, fen and open water habitats and of paths.

==Economy and services==

The Thetford Borough Police Force was established in 1836, and in 1857 the small force joined Norfolk County Constabulary. Thetford Fire Brigade was established in 1880.

The Thetford Gas Company, founded in 1838, proved very short-lived until Thetford Gasworks opened on Bury Road in 1845. In 1848, gas street lighting was installed in Thetford. From 1877 the town was provided with a clean water supply thanks to a new reservoir and steam engine on Gallows Hill to pump fresh water into the town. In 1929 the Anglian Electricity Supply Company began supplying electricity to the town, which was completed in 1933.

Thetford was the headquarters of Tulip International, large-scale manufacturers of bacon, beef and pork. In March 2007 the factory laid off three quarters of their workforce in Thetford with the loss of 350 jobs, and the factory later closed in 2010. In January 2018 it was announced that a new retail park and restaurant had been approved on the factory site with over of retail floor space. The development was initiated by Stapleford Thetford Ltd. as part of the Thetford-Cambridge-Norwich Technology Corridor. The market is held outside Thetford Guildhall in the town centre on Tuesdays and Saturdays.

The British Trust for Ornithology has its headquarters at The Nunnery in Thetford.

==Landmarks==
Thetford contains the ruins of Thetford Castle and Thetford Priory, which was closed during the Reformation. The Grade II listed timber-framed Bell Inn in the town was first mentioned in 1493 and was used as a coaching inn on the Norwich-London road until 1845 when it became connected by railway. The Black Horse public house dates from the mid 18th century, and is grade II listed. Thetford Warren Lodge was built in around 1400 by the Prior of Thetford to protect gamekeepers and hunters against poachers, and was later used to harvest rabbits.

The Charles Burrell Museum opened in 1991 in the former Paint Shop of Charles Burrell &amp; Sons on Minstergate in Thetford. The museum is dedicated to steam power and steam transport. The Ancient House Museum is situated in an oak-framed Tudor merchant&#x27;s house on White Hart Street. It contains replicas of the Thetford Hoard and has numerous displays about flinting, rabbit warrens and wildlife. The Thetford Academy, Norfolk was established through the merger of Charles Burrell Humanities School and Rosemary Musker High School in September 2010.

==Culture==
The external scenes for the BBC TV series &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; were filmed in and around the town, with Thetford&#x27;s flint buildings doubling for Walmington-on-Sea. The Dad&#x27;s Army Museum is housed in part of Thetford Guildhall.

Thetford Golf Club, to the northwest of the town in Thetford Forest Park, was established in 1912 with a course originally designed by Charles H. Mayo, and later alterations by James Braid and Philip Mackenzie Ross. The construction of the second Thetford bypass resulted in five of the course holes being lost and having to be re-fashioned by Cameron Sinclair and Donald Steel.

==Transport==

<text>Wareham ( ) is a historic market town and, under the name Wareham Town, a civil parish, in the English county of Dorset. The town is situated on the River Frome eight miles (13 km) southwest of Poole.

==Situation and geography==
The town is built on a strategic dry point between the River Frome and the River Piddle at the head of the Wareham Channel of Poole Harbour. The Frome Valley runs through an area of unresistant sand, clay and gravel rocks, and much of its valley has wide flood plains and marsh land. At its estuary the river has formed the wide shallow ria of Poole Harbour. Wareham is built on a low dry island between the marshy river plains.

The town is situated on the A351 Lytchett Minster-Swanage road, linking Wareham with the A35 and A31 roads and the M27 motorway. Wareham is also the eastern terminus of the A352 road to Dorchester and Sherborne, both roads now bypassing the town centre. The town has a station on the South West Main Line railway, and was formerly the junction station for services along the branch line to Swanage, now preserved as the Swanage Railway. The steam railway has ambitions to extend its service, currently from Swanage to Norden, near Corfe Castle back to Worgret Junction (where the mainline and branch divided) and into Wareham again.

To the north west of the town a large conifer plantation, Wareham Forest stretches several miles to the A35 road and the southern foothills of the Dorset Downs. To the south east is Corfe Castle and the heathland that borders Poole Harbour, including Wytch Farm oil field and Studland &amp; Godlingstone Heath Nature Reserve. About four miles (7 km) to the south is a chalk ridge, the Purbeck Hills which faces the Isle of Wight to the east, and eight miles (12 km) to the south is the English Channel.

==History==
The town&#x27;s strategic setting has made it an important settlement throughout its long history. Excavations at the nearby Bestwall site have produced evidence of transient early Mesolithic activity dating to around 9000 BCE. At the same site four large Neolithic pits containing worked flint and pottery fragments dating to 3700 BCE were found. Three green stone axeheads discovered also probably date to this period. Flint working and potting continued throughout the Bronze Age. The first house discovered dates to the mid 15th century BCE.

Archaeological evidence exists of a small Roman settlement, though the current town was founded by the Saxons. The Roman name is unknown, but the town is referred to as &quot;Werham&quot; in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; entry of 784, from Old English &quot;wer&quot; (meaning &#x27;fish trap, a weir&#x27;) and &quot;hām&quot; (&#x27;homestead&#x27;) or &quot;hamm&quot; (&#x27;enclosure hemmed in by water&#x27;).
The town&#x27;s oldest features are the town walls, ancient earth ramparts surrounding the town, likely built by Alfred the Great in the 9th century to defend the town from the Danes as part of his system of &quot;burh&quot; towns. The Danes invaded and occupied Wareham in 876, and only left after Alfred returned with an army and made a payment of Danegeld. In 998 they attacked again, and in 1015 an invasion led by King Canute left the town in ruins. The town was a Saxon royal burial place, notably that of King Beorhtric (d. 802). Also in the town at the ancient minster church of Lady St. Mary is the coffin said to be that of Edward the Martyr, dating from 978. His remains had been hastily buried there and were later taken from Wareham to Shaftesbury Abbey in north Dorset (and now lie in Brookwood Cemetery, Surrey).

By the end of the Saxon period, Wareham had become one of the most important towns in the county, to the extent that it housed two mints for the issue of Royal money. The Burghal Hidage lists the town as 1,600 hides, the third largest in the realm. During the Norman conquest of England, in late 1067, William I harried the town as his army passed into the west to lay siege to Exeter. The Normans later built a castle on the banks of the River Frome, at a site acquired from the Abbot of Shaftesbury and now known as Castle Close, which became the focus of much fighting between the forces of Stephen and Matilda during the period of civil war in the mid 12th century. The keep was destroyed at an unknown date in the 12th or 13th century, possibly under the terms of the Treaty of Wallingford, and no visible trace remains. Up until this time Wareham had been an important port; however the growth of Poole and the gradual silting of the river caused a decline in trade and by the end of the 13th century most of the foreign trade had transferred to Poole. Local trade continued to be handled at the Quay until the construction of the railway in the 19th century.

During the English Civil War, Wareham changed hands several times between the Royalists and Parliamentarians and in August 1644 was the site of a fierce battle with 2,000 Cromwellian soldiers besieging the town.

After the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, Wareham was one of a number of towns in Dorset where Judge Jeffreys held the Bloody Assizes, with five rebels being hanged, drawn and quartered on the West Walls, an area known as &#x27;Bloody Bank&#x27;. This may also have been the site of the execution of a hermit known as Peter de Pomfret who in 1213 had prophesied that before the next Ascension Day King John&#x27;s rule would be over. The prophecy turned out to be incorrect, and the King decreed that Peter should be dragged through the streets of the town tied to a horse&#x27;s tail and hanged together with his son.

In 1762, a fire destroyed two thirds of the town, which has been rebuilt in Georgian architecture with red brick and Purbeck limestone, following the earlier street pattern. The town is divided into four quarters by the two main roads, which cross at right-angles. The medieval almshouses escaped the fire, and some of the Georgian façades are in fact disguising earlier buildings which also survived.

With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Wareham became a garrison town with up to 7,000 soldiers living and training locally. The camp was re-located to nearby Bovington in 1922. The town survived the Second World War largely intact, although five houses were destroyed when a bomb dropped by a German aeroplane fell near St Martin&#x27;s Church in 1942.

Because of the constraints of the rivers and marshland Wareham grew little during the 20th century, while nearby towns, such as Poole, grew rapidly.

==Religious sites==

Wareham&#x27;s oldest places of worship include the Saxon church of Lady St. Mary (substantially modified but the origins are pre-conquest. The Saxon nave was demolished in 1841–2) 

St. Martins-on-the-Walls is also Saxon (built c.1030, dedicated to Martin of Tours). Both are Anglican.

The 14th-century building of Holy Trinity Church stands on the site of the Saxon chapel St Andrew&#x27;s and was until 2012 a tourist information centre. Other churches are the Wareham United Reformed Church in Church Street, St. Edward the Martyr Roman Catholic church on Shatters Hill, Wareham Methodist Church in North St. and the Evangelical Church in Ropers Lane. Sections of the churchyard of Lady St. Mary are managed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, containing as it does a number of graves of servicemen who died in a nearby military hospital during the First World War and others, including those of German and Polish servicemen, from the Second World War.

==Government==

The civil parish of Wareham Town encompasses the walled town of Wareham, situated on the land between the rivers Frome and Piddle, together with the area of Northport to the north of the River Piddle, and a relatively small amount of the surrounding rural area. The parish has an area of .

The sister civil parish of Wareham St. Martin covers much of the rural area to the north of Wareham, including the village of Sandford. Taken together the two Wareham parishes have an area of , with a 2011 population of 8,270 in 3,788 dwellings.

Both parishes form part of the Dorset unitary authority within the ceremonial county of Dorset of which it forms the Wareham ward. They are within the Mid Dorset and North Poole constituency of the House of Commons. Until 31 January 2020, they were also within the South West England constituency of the European Parliament. Prior to 2019, Wareham was also part of the Purbeck District of Dorset, before it was merged with other districts to the Dorset Unitary Authority.

==Culture and Media==

Wareham is twinned with Conches-en-Ouche in Normandy, France and with Hemsbach in Germany. 
Since the 16th century Wareham has been a market town, and still holds a market on Thursdays and Saturdays. In 2005 Wareham was named as a Fairtrade Town.

Events held in the town include the annual carnival which takes place in July with a parade, fireworks and music by the Quay. A new event is the music festival held in summer, with bands playing on the Quay, at Wareham Town Hall and in the town&#x27;s pubs. The Wareham Court Leet, one of the few remaining Court Leets in Britain, meets nightly during the last week in November.

In the church of St Martin-on-the-Walls, there is a recumbent effigy of T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) in Arab clothing, sculpted by Eric Kennington. Lawrence is buried at Moreton Churchyard where every year a quantity (decreases by one each year) of red roses are left. Near the town is Clouds Hill and Bovington army camp where Lawrence died after a motorbike accident. Wareham Town Museum, in East Street, has an interesting section on Lawrence and in 2006 produced an hour-long DVD entitled &quot;T. E. Lawrence — His Final Years in Dorset&quot;, including a reconstruction of the fatal accident. The museum also contains many artefacts on all aspects of the history of the town.

The Royal Air Force Air Cadets has an Air Training Corps squadron based in the town, namely 2185 (Wareham) Squadron ATC. The squadron&#x27;s cadets regularly partake in activities around the town for charitable purposes such as supporting the carnival, training exercises and parades. The squadron has a Detached Flight based at Swanage.

Local news and television programmes is provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Rowridge TV transmitter. 

The local radio stations are BBC Radio Solent, Heart South, Greatest Hits Radio South, Nation Radio South Coast and Greatest Hits Radio South. 

The Wareham Advertiser is the town&#x27;s local weekly newspaper.

===Cultural references===
Thomas Hardy in his novels based the town of &quot;Anglebury&quot; on Wareham. Dinah Craik used the town as one of the settings in her novel &quot;Agatha&#x27;s Husband&quot; (as &quot;Kingcombe&quot;). Anglebury House - a tea house/restaurant still operating on the high street - was frequented by T E Lawrence. The seat where Lawrence regularly sat is marked by a plaque.

Wareham is the setting for one of the &quot;Amazing Adventures of Scary Bones the Skeleton&quot; series of books for children by Ron Dawson, &quot;Scary Bones meets the Wacky Witches of Wareham&quot;. The book also includes a photograph of the town bridge and nearby Corfe Castle which also features in the story.

Some scenes from the 2002 German ZDF TV production &quot;Morgen Träumen Wir Gemeinsam&quot; (&quot;Tomorrow We Dream Together&quot;) were filmed in Wareham.

The hymn tune &quot;Wareham&quot; was composed by William Knapp (born at Wareham, 1698–9); Knapp composed several other hymn tunes and was parish clerk of Poole.

<text>Wells-next-the-Sea is a port town on the north coast of Norfolk, England.

The civil parish has an area of and in 2001 had a population of 2,451, reducing to 2,165 at the 2011 census.

Wells is to the east of the resort of Hunstanton, to the west of Cromer, and north of Fakenham. The city of Norwich lies to the south-east. Nearby villages include Blakeney, Burnham Market, Burnham Thorpe, Holkham and Walsingham.

==Origin of name==
The name is &quot;Guella&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086 (half gallicised, half Latinised from Anglian &quot;Wella&quot;, a spring). This derives from spring wells, of which Wells used to have many, rising through the chalk of the area. The town became Wells-next-the-Sea from &quot;juxta mare&quot; in the 14th century to distinguish it from other places of the same name. It appears as Wells Next the Sea (no hyphens) on the Ordnance Survey maps of 1838 and 1921. When the Wells and Fakenham Railway was opened on 1 December 1857, the terminus was given the name of Wells-on-Sea. In 1956 the Wells Urban District Council voted to re-adopt the name Wells-next-the-Sea, and this has been the official name since then.

==History==
The town has been a seaport since before the 14th century, when it supplied grain to London and subsequently to the miners of the north east, in return for which Wells was supplied with coal. Until the 19th century, it was easier to carry bulk cargoes by sea than overland. It was a significant port in the 16th century, with 19 ships over 16 tons burden operating out of Wells in 1580, making it the major port in the area. It had been, since the beginning of the century, an exporter of grain and an importer of coal. Wells was also from early days a manufactory of malt. At its height, the town boasted up to twelve maltings which, in 1750, contributed a third of the exports of malt from the country, mostly to Holland, more than any other port save for Great Yarmouth.

Wells was also a fishing port: in 1337, it is recorded as having had thirteen fishing boats and nearby Holkham had nine. Its mariners brought first herring and then cod from Iceland in quantity between the 15th and 17th centuries. The regulation of the harbour in order to preserve its use was by Act of Parliament in 1663; in 1769, Harbour Commissioners were appointed with powers over vessels entering and leaving (as they still have today). The quay was substantially rebuilt in 1845, as part of attempts to improve the town. At the same time, Improvement Commissioners were appointed with the task of making the town commodious and attractive to residents and the burgeoning tourist trade. As a small port, it built ships until the late 19th century; it never transferred to building motor vessels or to steel hulls. The coming of the railway in 1857 reduced the harbour trade, but it revived briefly after the Second World War for the import of fertiliser and animal feed. In 1982, there were 258 ship movements into the harbour.

Wells relies on the tides to scour the harbour because the town does not have a river running through it. The problem of siltation had preoccupied the merchants of the town for hundreds of years and occupied the attentions of various engineers, leading eventually to disputes which came to court in the 18th century. Sir John Coode, who had been knighted for his work on the completion of Portland Harbour, was recruited to solve its siltation problems in the 1880s; no attempted solution proved permanent. The growth of faster marine traffic, whose wake washes at the banks of the marshes, has widened the channel and reduced tidal flow further.

The North Sea is now a mile from the town; the main channel which once wandered through marshes, grazed by sheep for hundreds of years, was confined by earthworks to the west in 1859 when Holkham Estate reclaimed some 800 hectares of saltmarsh north-west of Wells with the building of a mile-long bank. This reclamation was claimed to have reduced the tidal scour though the West Fleet, which provided much of the water entered the channel to its north.

In the 19th century, malting assumed an industrial character dominated by merchants rather than hands-on maltsters. Eventually, the entire estate was acquired by F. &amp; G. Smith who had maltings in Dereham and Great Ryburgh; they latterly bought out the competition becoming one of the biggest maltsters in the country. Following the First World War, demand began to fall and new methods of production were being used. After a local dispute, they closed the Wells operation down in 1929. Other agriculture-related enterprises, such as the local flour mill and the Ipswich-based Eastern Counties Farmers Cooperative, were, over the following years, bought out or closed. The post-war revival of the harbour trade made the quay a busy place from the 1960s to the 1990s. Small coasters, mostly from across the English Channel, brought in fertiliser and animal feed, latterly mostly soya beans until 1992 when changes in government regulations and the increasing size of vessels made the port uneconomic. Wind-farm support began in 2009, with the building of the Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm. The transfer of operations to Yarmouth, on the closure of the facility in Wells in 2021, repeated the long-term pattern of opportunity and reversal in the town.

Tourism, which had begun on a small scale a century before, became a major draw; it was based on the Pinewoods Caravan site much expanded post-war first by the Town Council and subsequently by Holkham Estates. As with many coastal towns, the number of second homes resultant on the tourist trade has increased dramatically over the last few years, reaching over 34% in 2019.

==Geography==
The town has long thrived as a seaport and is now also a seaside resort with a popular beach that can be reached on foot or by car. (The narrow-gauge railway, built in 1976, that ran partway alongside the mile-long sea wall north of the harbour closed in 2021). The beach is known for its long flat terrain, abstract sand dunes, varied beach huts and a naturist area situated to the west at Holkham. A landlocked brackish pool called Abraham&#x27;s Bosom was for many years used for pleasure boating and canoeing; it is all that remains of the West Fleet which once drained the Holkham marshes. The beach is backed by dense pine woods which are part of the Holkham National Nature Reserve. The woods comprise Scots pine, Maritime pine and Corsican Pine growing on sand.

More pinewoods exist to the east of the beach over the shipping channel at an area called the East Hills. This can be accessed on foot at low tide though all of the tidal sands in the area are extremely dangerous due to the speed and currents of the rising tide. It is not advisable to cross the channel without detailed local knowledge.

The majority of shops and other such businesses are now found on Staithe Street but up to the 1960s commercial premises were also to be found along High Street which continues south towards St Nicholas&#x27;s Church. The church burned down after a lightning strike in 1879; the exterior shows the original stonework, but the interior, while light and airy, lacks stained glass, once found. The Victorian bench ends are worth a look. John Fryer, Captain Bligh&#x27;s sailing master on HMS &quot;Bounty&quot;, was born at Wells and is buried in the churchyard. His gravestone is in the church porch.

The distinctive landmark of the seafront is the granary with its overhanging gantry on the quay, started in 1904 and finished in 1905. This has now been converted into flats, having ceased operating as a granary in 1990. The maritime tradition of the town meant it used to have a remarkable number of public houses for a town of its size although many of these have since closed. The northern end of the town used to be notable for parallel &#x27;yards&#x27;, narrow rows of cottages similar to the northern &#x27;ginnels&#x27;, which may derive from the rebuilding of the port in the eleventh century. (The original port is reputed to have been adjacent to the church.) Most of these remain though some have been lost to development and slum clearance. The North Sea flood of 1953 affected the northern edge of the town, breaching the beach bank and causing damage to houses on both east and west ends of the town. It also destroyed the Pinewoods caravan site. The pines themselves, which had been planted in the nineteenth century to stabilise the dunes and which fringed Abraham&#x27;s Bosom, survived. Today there is a large moving floodgate next to the harbour car park and many of the houses have their own flood defences. It proved its worth in December 2013 when a flood exceeded both the 1953 and 1978 events, holding back the waters so that the west end of the town was unaffected.

A feature of the town is the area known as The Buttlands, a large green ringed by lime trees. Large elegant Georgian houses overlook The Buttlands, as do the Crown Hotel, Globe Inn and the Wells Catholic Church. If one exits The Buttlands down the hill at its south-west corner they can see Ware Hall, a medieval house which was rebuilt over a period of years from the 1970s by Miss May Savidge, who brought it in parts when she moved from Ware in Hertfordshire.

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Wells-next-the-Sea, at parish (town), district, and county level: Wells-next-the-Sea Town Council, North Norfolk District Council, and Norfolk County Council. The town council has its offices at the Wells Community Hospital on Mill Road, on the western outskirts of the town.

Wells-next-the-Sea was an ancient parish within the hundred of North Greenhoe. Until 1844 the parish was governed by its vestry, in the same way as most rural parishes. In 1844 an act of parliament established improvement commissioners to look after the secular aspects of local government in the town.

Under the Local Government Act 1894 the improvement commissioners were replaced by an elected urban district council. Until 1954 the urban district council was based at the offices of the solicitor who acted as clerk to the council, at the corner of Chancery Lane and The Buttlands. In 1954 the council bought the former Park Cinema at 62 Mill Road for £1,600 and converted it to become their offices and meeting place, holding their first meeting there in December 1954.

The urban district council was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, with the area becoming part of North Norfolk. A successor parish was established to cover the former urban district, with its council adopting the name Wells-next-the-Sea Town Council. The former council offices at 62 Mill Road were subsequently redeveloped for housing in the 1990s.

==Transport==
===Railways===
The coming of the railway in 1857 notably reduced the town&#x27;s population, as mentioned in the 1861 census. Formerly, the town was served by Wells-on-Sea railway station and was connected to the British Rail network by two lines. The line westwards towards King&#x27;s Lynn was never reinstated after damage in the North Sea flood of 1953, while the line to Norwich via Fakenham, Dereham and Wymondham was a victim of the &quot;Beeching Axe&quot; of the 1960s. The Wells and Walsingham Light Railway, a 10¼ inch-gauge railway (the longest of such a gauge in the world), now uses part of the track-bed and has its own separate Wells railway station.

In addition to the two passenger railway routes in and out of the town, there was a tramway from the station to the quayside at Wells Harbour, whose rails are still visible today just beneath the modern road surface along East Quay. Locomotives were not allowed along the quay and wagons were hauled by horses. The line continued in a curve to the south-east to connect with the lines at Wells station and the track bed can be walked.

The Wells Harbour Railway was a separate 10¼ inch-gauge railway that took passengers from the harbour behind the sea wall towards the beach and caravan site. It was in operation from 1976 to 2021, when the lines were taken up.

===Buses===
Wells was located on the high-profile &quot;Coasthopper&quot; bus route between King&#x27;s Lynn and Cromer, run by Norfolk Green. The operation was handed over to Stagecoach in 2015 but, in April 2018, Stagecoach ceased operations in Norfolk. The Coasthopper service was split into two sections at Wells-next-the-Sea: the section from King&#x27;s Lynn to Wells was rebranded as the &quot;Coastliner&quot; 36, extended inland from Wells to Fakenham and taken over by Lynx; the section from Wells to Cromer was taken over by Sanders Coaches.

==Lifeboat==
The new Lifeboat station, replacing one which had stood since 1899, was opened in 2022 to house the new &quot;Shannon&quot;-class lifeboat named the &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot;, which came on station in October. It replaced the Mersey-class boat, &quot;Doris Mann of Ampthill&quot;, which had served since 1990, making it then the longest serving lifeboat in the fleet. The old lifeboat station, which was the subject of some support for its retention, was demolished immediately thereafter. A new longer launch slipway was built at the same time, with a new tractor and trailer obtained. This is necessary for the retrieval of the boat after a call-out and, if there is a call-out when the tide is out, a response can only be made by taking the boat across over a mile of sand for launch in Holkham bay. An Atlantic-class, rigid inflatable inshore boat is used for callouts along the coast; it has proved itself by responding to an increasing number of people cut off by the tide and carried out to sea while swimming or using paddleboards and inflatables.

The earlier lifeboat house, built in the 1860s and now used as the harbour office, is at the western end of the quay.

In 1880, during the Wells lifeboat disaster, eleven of the thirteen crew drowned, leaving ten widows and 27 children without fathers. A memorial to the crew stands adjacent to the old lifeboat house.

==Education==
Various charity schools in the town included that set up by Christopher Ringer in 1678 when he left £600 in his will for the education of thirty boys and thirty girls in the town. A number of academies were established in the nineteenth century; none of these survive. A National School was set up following the closure of the town workhouse. A British School was set up in 1938 which became a Board School in 1875. A secondary school was built in 1929 when the original school became the primary school. The primary school closed in 1964 when the Alderman Peel secondary modern school was built in a different part of town adjacent to the old Heacham railway line. The old school buildings were used for some years as a field studies centre but have now been converted to social housing units administered by Homes for Wells, a community led housing association. Wells schools are now part of the Wensum Trust which administers 24 schools in Norfolk.

==Media==
The town receives television signals from the Belmont TV transmitter which broadcast BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire programmes and the local relay transmitter that broadcast BBC East and ITV Anglia which is transmitted from the Tacolneston TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Norfolk, Heart East, Amber Radio, Greatest Hits Radio East (formerly North Norfolk Radio), and Poppyland Community Radio, a community based station.

Local newspapers are &quot;Fakenham &amp; Wells Times&quot;, &quot;North Norfolk News&quot; and &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot;.

==Beach==
The Wells-next-the-Sea beach, being subject to the ever-changing tides of Holkham National Nature Reserve, makes use of an old war siren to warn patrons of incoming beach floodings. The siren sounds around 5–10 minutes before the tide is predicted to take over the beach to allow users to vacate the area safely.

==Storms==
Wells has been subjected to flooding going back to the thirteenth century. In the twentieth century, the notorious 1953 floods were followed by a surge almost as dangerous in 1978, for which the town was better prepared. On 5 December 2013, a storm surge occurred which caused severe damage to the properties on the Quay and to the east; it did not affect the west end of the town because of a tidal barrier built in 1982. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, visited the town on 9 December 2013 to inspect the damage caused by flooding.

<text>Whitstable () is a town on the north coast of Kent, England, at the convergence of the Swale and the Greater Thames Estuary, north of Canterbury and west of Herne Bay. 

The town, formerly known as Whitstable-on-Sea, was famous for oysters, collected from beds beyond the low water mark from Roman times until the mid-20th century. The annual Whitstable Oyster Festival takes place during the summer.

In 1830, the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway, one of the earliest passenger services, opened. In 1832, the company built a harbour and extended the line to handle coal and other bulk cargos for the City of Canterbury. The railway has closed, but the harbour still plays an important role in the town&#x27;s economy. The railway route is now a cycle path which leads to Canterbury.

==History==
Archaeological finds indicate that the Whitstable area was inhabited during the Palaeolithic era, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Oysters were harvested in the area in Roman times. The remains of a Roman building have been found in the centre of the town. Charters indicate that there were Saxon settlements where salt production and coastal trade occurred. In the 19th century, extensive finds of Roman pottery were found in the sea around Whitstable during oyster dredging, and an offshore rock near the town has been associated with &quot;Caunos&quot;, an island mentioned by Ptolemy.

The town was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, under the name &quot;Witenestaple&quot;, meaning &quot;the meeting place of the white post&quot;, a reference to a local landmark. At that time, Witenestaple was the administrative centre of the hundred of Witenestaple which stretched from the coast to the village of Blean, north of Canterbury. In addition to Witenestaple, the hundred contained three manors at Seasalter, Northwood and Swalecliffe. Whitstable hundred was located within the Lathe of St Augustine.

The Seasalter and Swalecliffe manors were owned by the church, and the manor at Northwood was run by a noble family on behalf of the king. Fisheries were located at the Seasalter manor, saltworks were at the Northwood manor, and pigs were farmed at the forest in Blean. By 1226, the name of the area had evolved into Whitstaple. Saltworks were opened at the Seasalter manor around the turn of the 14th century, and a sea wall was built there in 1325 to prevent coastal flooding. The history and development of the town has determined and been determined by the shape and location of the coast which has changed over recorded history due to natural events and human interventions.

By the late middle ages Whitstable had become a centre of Thames Estuary fishing, including for oysters, and was connected by road to Chestfield where archaeological finds evidence seafood consumption, as well as the Forest of Blean.

By 1413, the three manors had combined to form the Whitstaple manor, and had been sold to a religious foundation in Essex. The manor was seized by King Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, and was given to the Minter family, originally from Ickham. Branches of the Minter family survive today in the same area. A royal patent was granted in 1574 to the manor owner for the fishing of its oyster beds, and in the same year, the lands at Tankerton were incorporated into the manor. A copperas works was established at Tankerton in 1588, which operated until about 1830. By 1610, the name Whitstaple had become Whitstable.

Around the mid-18th century, goods and passengers began to be transported by ship between London and Whitstable, and a toll road was built to the cathedral city of Canterbury. These improvements in transport led to the town&#x27;s development as a seaside resort; the first advertisements for bathing machines at Whitstable appeared in 1768. In 1790 the manor was sold to private landowners, and three years later the rights to harvest the oyster beds were bought by the newly established Company of Free Fishers and Dredgers of Whitstable, the successor to the Whitstable Company of Dredgers. Between roughly 1775 and 1875 the well smacks or early longliners out of Barking and other local fishing ports would collect lugworms and whelks from Whitstable&#x27;s bait-diggers and dredgers before beginning their tour for prime fish north to Iceland. Whelks suspended in net bags in the well could live for a while due to circulating water. In the 1880s, Whitstable was described as having &quot;an unrivalled, and indeed unchallenged, position in the oyster world&quot;.

On 3 May 1830, the world&#x27;s first entirely steam-hauled passenger and freight railway service was opened by the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway Company. Designed by William James, the line ran six miles (10 km) from Westgate in Canterbury to Whitstable town centre. The railway line&#x27;s initials—C&amp;WR—and Whitstable&#x27;s shellfish industry eventually led to its nickname, the Crab And Winkle Railway. The line carried coal arriving by sea in Whitstable to Canterbury, delivered by colliers sailing from the north east of England. At this time, the town also had a thriving shipbuilding industry. In the mid nineteenth century, hoys also sailed regularly from London to Whitstable.
Trains were driven by a locomotive for part of the journey, but on inclined planes were pulled on ropes by steam-driven stationary winding engines located at Tyler Hill and Clowes Wood. The locomotive used was the &quot;Invicta&quot;, an 0-4-0 inclined cylinder tender locomotive built by Robert Stephenson, the son of engineer George Stephenson. Whitstable harbour - also designed by Stephenson - was opened by the railway company in 1832, and the rail line was extended to enable goods, mainly coal, to be directly transferred from ships onto the trains. In 1834, the world&#x27;s first season tickets were issued for the C&amp;WR line. The harbour&#x27;s size and positioning meant that it was the last place on England&#x27;s east coast where barquentines, schooners and brigantines transporting coal could operate, with sailing colliers serving Whitstable Harbour until the 1920s.

The &quot;Invicta&quot; locomotive was retired in 1840 and replaced by horses until a third winding engine was built at South Street. The &quot;Invicta&quot; was kept for scrap, but in 1898 work began on its restoration, which continued intermittently until its completion in 1977 by the National Railway Museum in York. On 3 May 1980 the locomotive was returned to Canterbury to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the line. On Sunday 16 June 2019 Invicta was returned to the Whitstable Museum &amp; Gallery.

Around the time of the construction of the Whitstable to Canterbury line, the local Gorrell stream was diverted into what was known as the Backwater reservoir, so as to prevent the railway needing to cross the estuary of the stream on damp and unstable land. The Gorrell Backwater was then filled through the stream itself as well as rain water drainage when the tide was in, and whilst out the water would be released into the newly built Whitstable Harbour. The reservoir unfortunately would contribute to the flooding of the town during years when the reservoir could not be drained, such as in 1897 and 1953 when weather conditions were exceptionally bad. This continued into the late 1960s, when fire engines were used to pump out large quantities of the water to prevent further flooding.

In the early 1970s, the present Gorrell Tank was built underground, with the Gorrell Car Park being in service above ground since.

In 1845, the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway Company was bought by the South Eastern Railway, who introduced steam locomotives capable of operating along the entire length of the railway. A direct rail route from Whitstable to London was established in 1860 when the London, Chatham and Dover Railway opened a station on what is now the Chatham Main Line. On 16 November 1869, 71 buildings in the town were destroyed by a fire which started at a shop near the harbour. In about 1854 the first branch of the Sea Cadet Corps, then known as the Naval Lads&#x27; Brigade, was established in the town by the Reverend Henry Barton.

A plant to manufacture tarmacadam was built beside Whitstable Harbour in 1936. The harbour gradually fell into decay after the Second World War, but in 1958 the Whitstable Urban District Council purchased and repaired the harbour with the intention of rejuvenating the town&#x27;s economy.

The Crab and Winkle Line finally closed in 1953, but about a third of the line was reopened as a footpath and cycleway in 1999 under the stewardship of a local charity, the Crab and Winkle Line Trust. One of the main developments to the town in recent years was the Horsebridge project. Completed in 2005, it was designed to regenerate a dilapidated area of the town with the construction of new shops and houses, a town square, and a community centre with a performance space and art gallery.

===Oysters===


Whitstable became famous for its native oysters produced by the three companies in the area: The Faversham Oyster Fishery Company, the Seasalter and Ham Oyster Company and the Whitstable Oyster Fishery Company. Oysters have been farmed in Whitstable for centuries, but it was not until 1793 that the industry became highly regulated with the Act of Incorporation of the &#x27;Company of Free Fishers and Dredgers of Whitstable&#x27; (33 Geo. 3. c. 42) and are all unusual in that they own the freehold of the seabed. But Whitstable oysters go even further back, almost two thousand years, to when the Romans discovered them and, regarding them as a delicacy, shipped them back live to Rome. They are a registered Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) product. At these companies&#x27; peak in the 1850s, they were sending as many as 80 million oysters a year to Billingsgate fish market. By then the plentiful oyster had become the food of the poor. Unfortunately the native oyster population drastically declined in the first half of the 20th century and a combination of pollution, disease, overfishing and the introduction of diseases proved fatal to the industry by the middle of the 20th century. Pacific Oysters are now farmed on the foreshore at Whitstable, owned by the Whitstable Oyster Fishery Company on a commercial scale producing up to 300 tons of sustainable shellfish per year. The farm was the subject of an investigation by the Marine Management Organisation in 2016 after allegations about the racks causing safety issues and blocking navigation for watercraft and swimmers. This ended in two independent navigational risk assessments commissioned by the MMO that concluded that the risk posed by the presence of the oyster farm remains ALARP or lower (broadly acceptable) and that the oyster farm’s activities met the requirements of the exemption relating to shellfish propagation and cultivation under the Marine Licensing (Exempted Activities) Order 2011 (SI 2011/409) as amended (Article 13).

==Governance==
Since 1918, Whitstable has been in the constituency of Canterbury. The Member of Parliament for the constituency is Rosie Duffield of the Labour Party, who was first elected in the 2017 general election after unseating long-serving Conservative MP Julian Brazier.

Whitstable, along with Herne Bay and Canterbury, is in the City of Canterbury local government district. The town comprises the five electoral wards of Tankerton, Seasalter, Chestfield, Swalecliffe, and Gorrell. These wards have 9 of the 39 seats on the Canterbury City Council. Following the 2023 local elections, four of those seats were held by the Labour Party, 3 by the Green Party and 2 by the LiberalDemocrats. Whitstable has no parish or town council. In their lieu, the Official Planning Consultee was the Whitstable Society, membership of which is open to all, until Cllr. Ben Fitter-Harding removed it in 2020.

==Geography==
Whitstable is on the north-east Kent coast. The town lies to the east of the outlet of The Swale into the Greater Thames Estuary. The town is west of the seaside town of Herne Bay, north-east of the town of Faversham and north of the city of Canterbury; several small villages lie in between. The suburbs/villages of Tankerton, Swalecliffe and Chestfield are at the eastern end of the town, Seasalter at the west, and South Street at the south. Chestfield has its own parish council. An area of protected woodland and grassland called Duncan Down lies to the south-east.
The geology of the town consists mainly of London Clay (which covers most of North Kent). Much of the centre of the town is built on low-lying marshland. Sea walls are in place to prevent coastal flooding. The land in the east is higher, with slopes down to the coast at Tankerton. The whole of the north-east Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

A very unusual (some say unique) shingle spit locally named &quot;The Street&quot; extends into the sea to the east of the harbour, formed by the local currents. A survey in 2019 discovered it is an especially heavy London clay, and is all that remains of the saltmarsh that once extended the length of the Swale. It is exposed at low tide, and visitors, ignoring the warning signs, are sometimes trapped by the advancing tide, needing to be rescued by the local RNLI lifeboat.

===Climate===
In East Kent, the warmest time of the year is July and August, when maximum temperatures average around 22 °C (71.6 °F). The coolest time of the year is January and February, when minimum temperatures average around 2 °C (35.6 °F). East Kent&#x27;s average maximum and minimum temperatures are around 1/2 °C higher than the national average. Whitstable is sometimes warmer than other parts of Kent due to it being backed by the North Downs to the south.

East Kent&#x27;s average annual rainfall is about 613 mm (24.1 in); October to January being the wettest months. The national average annual rainfall is about 870 mm (34 in). A recent drought caused Mid Kent Water to impose a hosepipe ban between August 2005 and February 2007.

The nearest Met Office average data for each month as well as the current data reported on the BBC web site are from recording stations approximately away to east and west and do not well represent Whitstable weather.

==Demography==

At the 2001 UK census, Whitstable area electoral wards had a population of 30,195 and a population density of 10.3 persons per hectare.

The ethnicity of the town was 98.2% white, 0.8% mixed race, 0.2% Chinese, 0.4% other Asian, 0.2% black and 0.2% other. The place of birth of residents was 95.5% United Kingdom, 0.6% Republic of Ireland, 1.2% other Western European countries, and 2.7% elsewhere. Religion was recorded as 74.8% Christian, 0.3% Muslim, 0.3% Buddhist, 0.2% Jewish, 0.1% Hindu and 0.1% Sikh. 15.8% were recorded as having no religion, 0.4% had an alternative religion and 8.1% did not state their religion.

The age distribution was 5% aged 0–4 years, 14% aged 5–15 years, 4% aged 16–19 years, 28% aged 20–44 years, 26% aged 45–64 years and 23% aged 65 years and over. The town has a high percentage of residents over 65, compared with the national average of 16%. As a seaside town, Whitstable is a popular retirement destination.

Of the town&#x27;s 13,155 households, 49.0% were married couples, 7.8% were cohabiting couples and 8.0% were lone parents. 30.7% of households were individuals, and 18.0% had someone living alone at pensionable age. 26.4% of households included children aged under 16, or a person aged 16 to 18 who was in full-time education.

==Economy==
According to the 2001 UK census, the economic activity of residents in the town aged 16–74 was 35.6% in full-time employment, 13.4% in part-time employment, 10.4% self-employed, 2.5% unemployed, 2.4% students with jobs, 3.4% students without jobs, 18.8% retired, 6.7% looking after home or family, 4.5% permanently sick or disabled and 2.3% economically inactive for other reasons. The percentage of retired people was significantly higher than the national figure of 13.5%. The unemployment rate of 2.5% was lower than the national rate of 3.3%. 12% of the town&#x27;s residents aged 16–74 had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared to 20% nationwide.

The main activities at the harbour are fishing, fish processing, cargo handling and boat storage. The harbour area is the site for other industries such as tarmac manufacturing and a maintenance port for an offshore windfarm. Business parks located on the outskirts of the town provide premises for large retailers, offices and light industries.

The town&#x27;s distinctive character and ambience has led to a strong tourist industry, which is promoted each year by the Oyster Festival. In early 2007, Canterbury City Council were planning to boost tourism by building retail developments in addition to the existing shopping centre.

The 2001 UK census reported the industry of employment of residents of Whitstable as 18% retail, 13% health and social work, 12% manufacturing, 11% education, 10% real estate, 9% construction, 7% transport and communications, 5% public administration, 5% hotels and restaurants, 4% finance, 1% agriculture and 5% other community, social or personal services. Compared to national figures, the town had a relatively high number of workers in the construction, education, and health/social care industries and a relatively low number in manufacturing, finance, and real estate. Many residents commute to work outside the town; at the 2001 census, there were 13,260 employed residents, but only 9,725 jobs within the town.

The high level of employees in teaching is possibly due to the town&#x27;s proximity to Canterbury, which has three higher education establishments. The elderly population of the town has led to many health and social care jobs at local care homes and at the Whitstable and Tankerton Hospital. At the 2001 census, 1.3% of the town&#x27;s population resided in a medical or care establishment, compared to the national average of only 0.8%.

==Transport==
Whitstable railway station is on the Chatham Main Line, which runs between Ramsgate in East Kent and London Victoria. Other stations on this line include Broadstairs, Margate Herne Bay, Faversham, Gillingham, Rochester and Bromley South. Whitstable is around 1 hour and 30 minutes from London Victoria, ten minutes more than in 2009 due to the introduction of HS1 services further up the line. On weekdays, during the morning and evening peaks, there is a direct service to London&#x27;s Cannon Street station, provided primarily for business commuting; these trains run to Cannon Street in the morning and back in the evening. All services are operated by Southeastern.

A National Express coach service runs between London Victoria and Ramsgate.

There is a Stagecoach bus service, branded as the &quot;Triangle&quot;, running about every fifteen minutes to neighbouring Herne Bay and Canterbury, where many Whitstable residents go to work and shop. Route 5 runs from the town to Canterbury.

The A299 road, known as the &quot;Thanet Way&quot;, runs between Ramsgate and Faversham via Herne Bay and Whitstable; it merges with the M2 motorway at Faversham.

==Education==
Whitstable&#x27;s secondary school is The Whitstable School, formerly The Community College Whitstable. It is a secondary modern school which changed its name from Sir William Nottidge School in 1998. In 2009, 25% of its pupils gained at least five GCSEs at grades A*–C – this increased to 37% in 2011.
The School was rated &#x27;Requires Improvement&#x27; by Ofsted in March 2015.

Many pupils living in Whitstable commute to schools in other nearby towns, especially to the grammar schools in Faversham and Canterbury.

The town&#x27;s public primary schools are Whitstable Junior School, Whitstable and Seasalter Church of England Junior School, Westmeads Infant School, Swalecliffe Community Primary School, St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, St Alphege C of E Primary School, Joy Lane Primary School. The voluntary controlled church schools are owned by the church, but like the other schools, are administered by Kent County Council.

Whitstable Adult Education Centre runs adult learning courses.

==Culture==

===Events and venues===
The longest established event is the Regatta, dating from a sailing contest between 26 boats from Whitstable and Faversham which was split into three classes (divisions) in 1792. A reporter at the scene wrote: &quot;Much nautical skill was displayed in the maneuvering of the various squadrons. Every hoy, smack, wherry etc. in the vicinity of Whitstable was crowded with company and formed quite a fair upon the ocean.&quot; In addition, at least two of the spectating boats had bands aboard and tents were erected along the shore which was lined with spectators.

The Regatta continued to become the biggest event on the North Kent Coast in the 19th century. It has moved from the original Whitstable to Tankerton for more land based events with fairground and fireworks on the elevated Slopes. For many years run by the council, the Whitstable and Herne Bay Lions Club have taken it on in the last 31 years. Future events will be more sea borne with yachting and rowing, and plans for swimming and even the traditional greasy pole.

May Day is celebrated with the annual Jack-in-the-Green parade, with traditional English dancing throughout the town, a fair at Whitstable Castle and a maypole dance by local schoolchildren overlooking the sea. It has been run by Whitstable and Herne Bay Lions Club for 34 years.

The importance of oysters to the tradition of Whitstable is celebrated with the Oyster Festival in July each year. The nine-day festival starts with an opening parade on the nearest Saturday to St James&#x27; Day. The parade starts with the official &quot;Landing of the Catch&quot;, followed by the procession of the oysters in a horse-drawn dray through the town, stopping to deliver the catch to local restaurants, cafes and public houses. The rest of the festival consists of entertainment for both adults and children, with local art on display around the town, and many establishments offering local fish dishes.

The Whitstable Museum and Gallery displays artefacts and portraits relating to the town&#x27;s seafaring traditions, with special features on oysters, diving and shipping. In 2001, the Museum was awarded the international Nautiek Award for services to diving history.

The Playhouse Theatre Whitstable is owned and administered by theatrical group, The Lindley Players Ltd. The theatre is regularly hired out to other local groups such as The Canterbury Players, Herne Bay Operatic Society, Theatrecraft &amp; The Deborah Capon College. More recently Nick Wilty has adopted the venue to host the OyOyster Comedy nights, attracting stars including Harry Hill, Jo Brand and Paul Merton.

The Horsebridge Arts and Community Centre opened in March 2004 as part of the Horsebridge redevelopment. Built with an &quot;upturned boat&quot; design, and three floors totalling , the centre contains an art gallery, a performance space, art workshops, a learning area, and conference rooms. The building in 2004 won the Kent Design Award in the Town and Village Renaissance category.

There are monthly beach cleans carried out alone the Whitstable sea front. They are organised by the Canterbury Council Foreshore service in conjunction with the Marine Conservation Society. The location of the beach clean alternates each month between the beach by the Neptune pub and the Seasalter end. Times and dates can be obtained for the Fore shore services or the MCS South East Groups website, calendar page.

===Attractions and landmarks===

The town has shingle/sandy beaches flanking the harbour, where sunbathing, swimming and water sports are popular. The beaches east and west are unique amongst seaside towns in the south-east of England for having no promenade; making them generally peaceful. An exception is Long Beach to the immediate east of the harbour where there is a base for jet skis. A notable feature of Whitstable is The Street, a natural strip of shingle on clay bank which runs out to sea at right angles to the coast, for a distance of about . It is the last remnant of the Swale river valley to the north of the town lost to sea erosion over millennia. Located to the east of the harbour, The Street is revealed only at low tide, when it is possible to walk out along it as well as swim either side in safe, sandy bottomed shallows. A view of The Street can be seen on the hilltop lawns of Tankerton Slopes. The Slopes are home to the largest population in England of the rare Hog&#x27;s Fennel.

Whitstable Castle is situated on the border of Whitstable and the suburb of Tankerton. It was originally built as an octagonal tower in 1789 by Charles Pearson, the owner of a copperas company in the town and a future investor in the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. However, Pearson later added to the building, developing it into a manor house. In 1836 the house, then known as Tankerton Tower, was bought by London businessman and Whig MP Wynn Ellis, who by 1842 had added a west wing, a bell tower and a lodge. The building had become known as Tankerton Castle by 1897, although it is now commonly referred to as Whitstable Castle. Now managed by the Whitstable Castle Trust, the castle grounds are a centre for community activity.

Off the coast of Whitstable is Kentish Flats offshore windfarm, consisting of 30 wind turbines, each high, providing enough electricity to power 70,000 households. The now-redundant Shivering Sands and Red Sands offshore World War II sea forts are visible from the town&#x27;s coast. Sailing trips are available from the harbour to the windfarm, the sea forts and a seal watching spot in the Thames Estuary.

Island Wall, the closest street to the seafront, has numerous buildings dating from the mid-19th century including the Neptune and Wall Tavern pubs, and the Dollar Row cottages, which were built from the proceeds of a salvage operation on a ship carrying silver dollars. The street is home to the &quot;Favourite&quot;, one of the few remaining Whitstable oyster yawls. Built in 1890, it is now managed by the Favourite Trust, a charitable trust who undertake fund raising to maintain the historical vessel. A traditional windmill on Borstal Hill, built in 1815, is used as a motel.

The town is criss-crossed by numerous small alleys, once used by fishermen to reach the beach. Many of these are now registered as public rights of way and are still in frequent use. Squeeze Gut Alley whose name suggests (erroneously) that most people have to walk sideways due to its narrowness, is one of the more notable.

The town claims to have the largest village green in England at Duncan Down ().

===Sport===
The town is a popular destination for watersport enthusiasts. Established in 1904, the Whitstable Yacht Club is one of the oldest yacht clubs in England and takes part in local and national competitions throughout the year. Each year, the town hosts the International Waterski Championships.

In May 2007, Whitstable Town Football Club, based at the Belmont ground, won promotion from the Kent League to the Isthmian League Division One South. Whitstable Rugby Football Club 1st XV also won promotion in 2007, to the London League. The club has a 2nd XV team which play in the East Kent League 2.

Whitstable has a council-owned swimming pool and sports centre with facilities for badminton, 5-a-side football, volleyball, cricket and tennis. A 10-pin bowling centre is located next door to the swimming pool. There is also an outdoor basketball court at the Rec near the swimming pool.

Windsurfing is common off the West Quay, usually at low tide in southwesterly winds. Kite surfing has become popular in recent years usually taking place east of the Harbour, due to its flat water conditions and exposure to the open sea.

===Local media===
The four local newspapers are the KM Group owned &quot;Whitstable Gazette&quot; and &quot;KM Extra&quot;, YourCanterbury part of KOS Ltd. and the Northcliffe Media-owned &quot;Whitstable Times&quot;.

During the 1960s, several pirate radio stations broadcast from the nearby Shivering Sands and Red Sands offshore sea forts. These included Radio Invicta, KING Radio, Radio Sutch (launched by Screaming Lord Sutch), Radio City, and Radio 390.

Local television news programmes are BBC South East Today and ITV News Meridian.

BBC local radio station is BBC Radio Kent on 96.7 FM.

Whitstable has a local radio station in KMFM Canterbury which also serves Canterbury and Herne Bay. It was previously known as &quot;CTFM&quot;, until it was taken over by the KM Group in September 2007. County-wide station Heart Kent (formerly Invicta FM) was based on the John Wilson business park in the town. In 2019, Heart Kent was rebranded under the Heart South banner.

Whitstable also has a community radio station which broadcasts online and is known as Whitstable Bay Radio (WBR) 

===Popular culture===
The playwright and novelist W. Somerset Maugham was sent to live with his uncle in Whitstable, at age 10, after the death of his parents. His novels &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1915) and &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot; (1930) are set in the fictional town of Blackstable. It is obvious that he based this town on Whitstable, as the names and description of places around Blackstable, including The Duke of Cumberland Inn and Joy Lane, are identical to places around Whitstable.

Whitstable is the hometown of the narrator, Nancy Astley, in Sarah Waters&#x27; 1998 novel &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot;. Whitstable also featured in the 2002 BBC drama adaptation. The Old Neptune Pub on the seafront was used as a filming location for the 2006 movie &quot;Venus&quot;, for which the actor Peter O&#x27;Toole earned an Academy Award nomination.

Whitstable features prominently in the 2021 AcornTV series &quot;Whitstable Pearl&quot;, starring Kerry Godliman, in which a restaurateur fancies herself a private detective in the seaside town.

<text>Winchcombe () is a market town and civil parish in the Borough of Tewkesbury in the county of Gloucestershire, England, it is north-east of Cheltenham. The population was recorded as 4,538 in the 2011 census and estimated at 5,347 in 2019. The town is located in the Cotswolds and has many features and buildings dating back to medieval times. In 2021 it was the primary strike site of the eponymous Winchcombe meteorite.

==History==
The Belas Knap Neolithic long barrow on Cleeve Hill above Winchcombe, dates from about 3000 BCE. In Anglo-Saxon times, Winchcombe was a major community in Mercia, favoured by King Coenwulf of Mercia, the others being Lichfield and Tamworth. In the 11th century, the town was briefly the county town of Winchcombeshire. The Anglo-Saxon St Kenelm, said to be a son of Coenwulf, is believed to be buried here.

During the Anarchy of the 12th century, a motte-and-bailey castle was built in the early 1140s for Empress Matilda, by Roger Fitzmiles, 2nd Earl of Hereford, but its exact site is unknown.

In the Restoration period, Winchcombe was noted for cattle rustling and other lawlessness, attributed in part to poverty. Local people seeking a living took to growing tobacco as a cash crop, although the practice had been outlawed since the Commonwealth period. Soldiers were sent in at least once to destroy the illegal crop.

Fragments of the Winchcombe Meteorite originating from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, fell on a house driveway on 28 February 2021. The meteorite is a rare carbonaceous chondrite, offering pristine material from the beginnings of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. This was preserved by its prompt collection by a local resident about 12 hours after falling to Earth. Another fragment was found by researchers on a local farm. Some of the meteorite fragments were put on display at the town museum.

==Attractions==
Winchcombe started life as a Roman hamlet, rising to prominence as an Anglo-Saxon walled town containing Winchcombe Abbey, where a Mercian king and his saintly son were buried. Although the town wall has long vanished, Winchcombe retains much of its medieval layout, with a mixture of timber-framed and Cotswold limestone buildings along its High Street, some dating back to the 15th century.

Winchcombe&#x27;s position on the Cotswold Way keeps it popular with walkers and history fans. Frequent visits are made to the heritage GWR steam railway that links it with Broadway and Cheltenham Racecourse, and with Sudeley Castle, the burial place of Queen Catherine Parr, which lies on the outskirts.

==Notable buildings==

Winchcombe and vicinity contain Sudeley Castle and the remains of Hailes Abbey, once a main place of pilgrimage, due to a phial said by the monks possessing it to contain the Blood of Christ. Nothing remains of Winchcombe Abbey. St Peter&#x27;s Church in the centre of the town is noted for its grotesques.

Several buildings around Sudeley Hill are Grade II listed.

==Walks==
Winchcombe is crossed by seven long-distance footpaths: The Cotswold Way, the Gloucestershire Way, the Wychavon Way, St Kenelm&#x27;s Trail, St Kenelm&#x27;s Way, the Warden&#x27;s Way and the Windrush Way. Winchcombe became a member of the Walkers are Welcome network of towns in July 2009 and now holds a walking festival every May.

==Public transport==
The town has bus services to Cheltenham, Broadway and Willersey.
Winchcombe had a railway opened in 1906 by the Great Western Railway from Stratford-upon-Avon to Cheltenham as part of a main line from Birmingham to the South West and South Wales. Winchcombe railway station and most others on the section closed in March 1960. Through passenger trains continued until March 1968 and goods until 1976, when a derailment caused damage and it was decided to close the section. By the early 1980s it had been dismantled. The length between Toddington and Cheltenham Racecourse via Winchcombe has been reconstructed as the heritage Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway. It was extended to Broadway in spring 2018. The new station building that opened at Winchcombe on its original site was brought from the former Monmouth Troy railway station. Nearby is the Greet Tunnel, the second longest on a British preserved line.

==Governance==

An electoral ward in the same name stretches from Alderton in the north to Hawling in the south. Its total population at the 2011 census was 6,295. Winchcombe Town Hall is now host to Winchcombe Folk and Police Museum.

==Schools==
Winchcombe has a secondary school – Winchcombe School in Greet Road, east of the town centre. Winchcombe Abbey Church of England Primary School lies near the town centre in Back Lane, next to Winchcombe Library and Cowl Lane.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Sutton Coldfield and local relay TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Gloucestershire on 104.7 FM, Heart West on 102.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West on 107.5 FM, and Radio Winchcombe, a community based radio station which broadcast to the town on 107.1 FM.

<text>Winchelsea () is a town in the county of East Sussex, England, located between the High Weald and the Romney Marsh, approximately south west of Rye and north east of Hastings. The current town, which was founded in 1288, replaced an earlier town of the same name, known as Old Winchelsea, that was lost to coastal erosion in the late medieval period. Winchelsea is part of the civil parish of Icklesham.

The mayor of Winchelsea is chosen each year from amongst the members of the corporation, who are known as freemen, rather than being elected by public vote. New freemen are themselves chosen by existing members of the corporation. Thus, in its current form, the corporation is effectively a relic of Winchelsea&#x27;s days as a &#x27;rotten borough&#x27; (when Winchelsea elected two MPs but the number of voters was restricted to about a dozen, sometimes fewer). The corporation lost its remaining civil and judicial powers in 1886 but was preserved as a charity by an Act of Parliament to maintain the membership of the Cinque Port Confederation. The mayor and corporation in Winchelsea now have a largely ceremonial role, together with responsibility for the ongoing care and maintenance of the main listed ancient monuments in the town and the Winchelsea Court Hall Museum.

==Toponym==
The name Winchelsea may be derived from the colloquial word &#x27;qwent&#x27; that refers to the marshland behind the town and the Saxon word &#x27;chesil&#x27; meaning shingle beach or embankment.

==History==
===Old Winchelsea===
Old Winchelsea was on a massive shingle bank that protected the confluence of the estuaries of the Rivers Brede, Rother and Tillingham and provided a sheltered anchorage called the Camber. The old town was recorded as &quot;Winceleseia&quot; in 1130 and &quot;Old Wynchchelse&quot; in 1321. The Normans used to call the place &quot;Wincenesel&quot;.

After the Norman Conquest, Winchelsea was of great importance in cross-Channel trade (acting in particular as an entrepôt for London) and as a naval base. In the 13th century, it became famous in the wine trade from Gascony.

There may have been, in the 1260s, over 700 houses, two churches and over 50 inns and taverns thus implying a population of thousands of people at the time. Prior to 1280 incursions by the sea destroyed much of the town until a massive flood completely destroyed it in 1287.

===Winchelsea===

In the late 13th century, the old town&#x27;s population moved to the town&#x27;s present location. In 1281 Edward I granted a charter for a planned town, based on a grid layout, to be built on higher ground on the western edge of Romney Marsh and Camber Sands. The names of the town planners are recorded as Henry le Waleys and Thomas Alard. The new town inherited the title of &quot;Antient Town&quot; from Old Winchelsea and retained its affiliation to the Cinque Ports confederation together with Rye and the five head-ports.

The town had a tidal harbour on the River Brede. It flourished until the middle of the 14th century. It then suffered French and Spanish raids during the Hundred Years&#x27; War (including the Castilian attack on Gravesend) until the 15th century and was hit by the Black Death. In 1350, the Battle of Les Espagnols sur Mer was fought nearby. In 1360 the town was sacked and burnt by a French expeditionary force, sent in an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve their King John II of France captured at the Battle of Poitiers four years earlier. The town remained prosperous, although reduced in size until the 1520s. The silting of the harbour ultimately destroyed its prosperity. Camber Castle was built by Henry VIII in the early 16th century halfway between Winchelsea and Rye to guard the approach to the Camber. Much of the stone used in its construction may have been taken from the demolition of the Franciscan monastery of Greyfriars. Winchelsea was greatly involved in the wine trade with Guyenne and the extensive wine cellars under the town may still be visited on open days. In the 1500s, Winchelsea hosted a small community of Huguenots.

Winchelsea retains its medieval setting on a hill surrounded by largely empty marsh, the original layout of the planned town and the largest collection of medieval wine cellars in the country with the possible exception of Norwich and Southampton. It also retains three of the four town gates and several original buildings, including the parish church, which is dedicated to St Thomas the Martyr. Another church, St Leonard&#x27;s, was later the site of a windmill, which was blown down in the Great Storm of 1987. Some of the original 13th/14th-century fortifications can still be seen at the Strand Gate and Pipewell or Ferry Gate. The scale of the original plan for New Winchelsea can be judged by the site of the &quot;New Gate&quot;, over half a mile outside the current town.

Across the road from the churchyard stands the Court Hall, one of Winchelsea&#x27;s oldest buildings, the lower floor once being the gaol. The first floor is now a museum, full of relics of the history of Winchelsea, the Corporation, and a model of the town. Nearby is the town well, dug in 1851 to save water being carried up the hill. It is thought to be 80 feet deep. At the foot of Strand Hill stands the town workhouse Strand House just behind the port area of Winchelsea which runs along the river bank on the far side of the main road. This area contains the remains of several old buildings, such as the Old Malt House and Appletree Wick while Strand House itself was built around 1425 according to dendrochronology. These buildings made up the workhouse of the parish of Winchelsea being known as &quot;The Old Poor Houses&quot;. The area was a subject of archaeological investigation in 2013 which found the remains of the medieval wharf and a medieval boat next to the Bridge Inn.

Winchelsea stands on the main south coast road, the A259. The Royal Military Canal built in the early 19th century as a defence-line against the highly anticipated invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte passes the eastern side of the town and connects to the river Brede.

The town lends its name to the nearby seaside village of Winchelsea Beach.

==Governance==
In 2006 a group of local residents requested Rother District Council to review the parishing arrangements of Icklesham, with a view to creating a separate Winchelsea Parish. The Parish of Winchelsea Action Group submitted a petition in favour from 228 electors. Other survey and polling evidence suggest the residents of Winchelsea are in favour by a majority of up to 2–1, but that the remainder of Icklesham parish was against the idea by a wide margin. In the May 2007 parish council elections, the proposal for a separate parish council was the key issue. The three candidates supporting a separate parish for Winchelsea were elected by a clear majority in a record turnout of some 66% and the two opposing candidates (including a member of the Corporation and former councillor) were defeated.

==Transport==
Winchelsea railway station is located to the north in the Brede valley, on the Marshlink line between and .

The A259 road, a major road from Hastings to Folkestone, runs around the edge of the village. Stagecoach Group run a bus service from Hastings to Rye via Winchelsea.

<text>Manuel DeLanda (born 1952) is a Mexican-American writer, artist and philosopher who has lived in New York since 1975. He is a lecturer in architecture at the Princeton University School of Architecture and the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, where he teaches courses on the philosophy of urban history and the dynamics of cities as historical actors with an emphasis on the importance of self-organization and material culture in the understanding of a city. DeLanda also teaches architectural theory as an adjunct professor of architecture and urban design at the Pratt Institute and serves as the Gilles Deleuze Chair and Professor of Philosophy at the European Graduate School. He holds a BFA from the School of Visual Arts (1979) and a PhD in media and communication from the European Graduate School (2010).

DeLanda was previously a visiting professor at the University of Southern California School of Architecture, where he taught an intensive two-week course in the spring 2012 term on self-organization and urbanity; adjunct associate professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation from 1995 to 2006; and adjunct professor at Cooper Union&#x27;s Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture.

==Films==
After moving to New York, DeLanda created several experimental films between 1975 and 1982, some as part of an undergraduate coursework at the School of Visual Arts. While at SVA, DeLanda studied under video artist Joan Braderman; they were subsequently married in 1980 and collaborated on several works (including Braderman&#x27;s &quot;Joan Does Dynasty&quot; [1986], DeLanda&#x27;s &quot;Raw Nerves&quot; [1980] and &quot;Ismism&quot; [1979]) before divorcing at an indeterminate point.

Influenced by the No Wave movement, DeLanda&#x27;s Super 8 and 16mm films also served as methodical, theory-based approaches to the form. He pulled them from circulation after the original negatives were lost; in 2011, Anthology Film Archives restored and reissued them.

Cited by filmmaker Nick Zedd in his Cinema of Transgression Manifesto, DeLanda associated with many of the experimental filmmakers of this New York based-movement. In 2010, he appeared in Céline Danhier&#x27;s retrospective documentary &quot;Blank City&quot;. Much of his oeuvre was inspired by his nascent interest in continental philosophy and critical theory; one of his best known films is &quot;Raw Nerves: A Lacanian Thriller&quot; (1980).

Having moved on to the nondeterministic synthesis of Baudrillardian and Deleuzian theory, command and control techniques, and materialistic concerns of complex systems and artificial life (including cellular automata) that would comprise &quot;Policing the Spectrum&quot; (1986) and &quot;War in the Age of Intelligent Machines&quot; (1992), DeLanda had largely eschewed by the mid-1980s his interests in &quot;post-Freudian ideas of the unconscious... as well as any interest in film theory.&quot;

==Philosophical work==
DeLanda&#x27;s notable works include &quot;War in the Age of Intelligent Machines&quot; (1991), &quot;A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History&quot; (1997), &quot;Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy&quot; (2002) and &quot;A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity&quot; (2006). He has published many articles and essays and lectured extensively in Europe and in the United States. His work focuses on the theories of the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari on one hand, and modern science, self-organizing matter, artificial life and intelligence, economics, architecture, chaos theory, history of science, nonlinear dynamics, cellular automata on the other. His 2015 book &quot;Philosophical Chemistry: Genealogy of a Scientific Field&quot; furthers his intervention in the philosophy of science and science studies.

<doc id="382021" wikidata="Q119936" url="?curid=382021" title="Windermere, Cumbria (town)">
<text>Windermere () is a town in the civil parish of Windermere and Bowness, in the Westmorland and Furness district in the ceremonial county of Cumbria, England; it is within the Lake District National Park. The town lies about half a mile (1 km) east of the lake, Windermere, from which it takes its name. In 2021 it had a population of 4,826.

While Windermere town does not itself touch the lake, it forms one urban area with the older town of Bowness-on-Windermere, which is directly on the lake shore. Windermere began to grow when the railway station and hotel of the same name opened in 1847. Tourism is popular in the town, owing to its proximity to the lake and local scenery. Boats from the piers in Bowness sail around the lake, many calling at Ambleside or at Lakeside where there is a restored railway.

==History==
Historically a part of the county of Westmorland, Windermere town was known as Birthwaite prior to the arrival of the Kendal and Windermere Railway, which stimulated its development. Windermere station offers train and bus connections to the surrounding area, Manchester Airport and the West Coast Main Line.

The geological formations around the area take their name from the town. They are called the Windermere Group of sedimentary rocks. 

==Etymology==

The word &quot;Windermere&quot; is thought to translate as &quot;Winand or Vinand&#x27;s lake&quot;. The specific has usually been identified with an Old Swedish personal name Vinandr. The other possibility is for a Continental Germanic name Wīnand.
The second element is Old English &#x27;mere&#x27;, meaning &#x27;lake&#x27; or &#x27;pool&#x27;.
There is a reference to &quot;Wynandermer&quot; in 1396.

==Governance==
Windermere was from 1894 to 1974 governed by an urban district council which in 1905 absorbed the former Bowness-on-Windermere UDC although Bowness remained a separate civil parish until 1974. Windermere UDC had slight boundary changes in 1934 and was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 replacing it with South Lakeland District Council. On 29 July 2020 the merged parish was renamed from &quot;Windermere&quot; to &quot;Windermere and Bowness&quot;. In 2023 South Lakeland was abolished and merged into Westmorland and Furness unitary authority area.

==Transport==
Windermere railway station was built in 1847 and was the reason the town was established. The station serves trains run by Northern to Oxenholme on the West Coast Main Line; some services continue on to .

Stagecoach Cumbria operates bus routes to Keswick, Kendal, Lancaster, Grasmere, Ambleside, Bowness-on-Windermere, Barrow-in-Furness, Penrith and Coniston.

The town is near the A591 road, a major road which runs through the Lake District from Kendal to Keswick.

==Local media==
Regional TV news is provided by BBC North West and ITV Border. Television signals are received from the local relay transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cumbria 104.2 FM, Heart North West on 102.3 FM, Smooth Lake District on 100.8 FM, and Lake District Radio that broadcast online from its studios in Kendal. 

The town&#x27;s local newspapers are The Westmorland Gazette and North West Evening Mail. 

==Education==
There are three primary schools located in the town. Secondary education is provided by The Lakes School (state) and Windermere School (independent, ages 2–18), both of which are located on the outskirts.

==Notable people==
* George Godfrey Cunningham (c. 1802–1860) – Scottish writer
* Thomas Gardner (born 1996) – filmmaker.
* Dr David Clark, Baron Clark of Windermere, lives in Windermere.

<doc id="382032" wikidata="Q2663783" url="?curid=382032" title="Wooler">
<text>Wooler ( ) is a town in Northumberland, England. It lies on the edge of the Northumberland National Park, near the Cheviot Hills. It is a popular base for walkers and is referred to as the &quot;Gateway to the Cheviots&quot;. As well as many shops and pubs, the town has a youth hostel, many hotels, and campsites. It lies on the St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Way long-distance footpath between Melrose Abbey and Lindisfarne.

The main A697 links the town with Morpeth and Coldstream on the Scottish Border. Wooler has two schools; Wooler First School (including Little Acorns Nursery) and Glendale Community Middle School. The schools and nursery share a single campus on Brewery Road (from September 2015) providing education for children in the Glendale area from 2 years old to 13 years old.

Close by to the west is Yeavering Bell, crowned by a large Iron Age fort, a stronghold of the Votadini. The remnants of many stone huts can be seen on its summit, which is surrounded by a collapsed stone wall. At the northern base of the hill is the site of Yeavering (known as Ad Gefrin in Bede&#x27;s Ecclesiastical History of the English People), which was the summer residence of the early Anglo-Saxon kings of Northumbria.

==History==
Wooler was not recorded in the Domesday Book, because when the book was written in 1086, northern Northumbria was not under Norman control. However, by 1107, at the time of the creation of the 1st Baron of Wooler, the settlement was described as &quot;situated in an ill-cultivated country under the influence of vast mountains, from whence it is subject to impetuous rains&quot;. Wooler subsequently enjoyed a period of prosperity and with its expansion it was granted a licence in 1199 to hold a market every Thursday. The St. Mary Magdalene Hospital was established around 1288.

Wooler is close to Humbleton Hill, the site of a severe Scottish defeat at the hands of Harry Hotspur in 1402. This battle is referred to at the beginning of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; – of which Hotspur is the dashing hero.

After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the patronage and tithe income from the parish church passed from the Bishop of Durham to the Earl of Tankerville.

Wooler also used to have a drill hall that was the local &quot;picture house&quot; which children were evacuated to in World War II. There also used to be a fountain situated at the top of Church Street in the town.

Alexander Dalziel of Wooler (1781–1832) was the father of the celebrated Dalziel Brothers. Seven of his eight children were artists, and became celebrated wood-engravers in London. Their sister Margaret was also a wood-engraver.

Between 1887 and 1965 the town was served by Wooler railway station on the Alnwick to Cornhill Branch.

==Places of worship==
Wooler has several places of worship including:
* St Mary&#x27;s Parish Church (Church of England, 1765), Church Street, a Grade II listed building. (There has been a building on the site for over 700 years.)
* Wooler United Reformed Church (1784), Cheviot Street, a Grade II listed building. (Before the union that formed the United Reformed Church in 1972, this was Wooler Presbyterian Church.)
* St Ninian&#x27;s Catholic Church (1856), Burnhouse Road, a Grade II listed building.
* Wooler Evangelical Church (Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches, 2003), Cheviot Street.
At one time, there was also a Methodist congregation in Wooler. The old Methodist chapel on Cheviot Street is now the Glendale Hall.

==Meaning of place-name==
Wooler may be from Old English &quot;wella&quot; &quot;well, spring&quot; and &quot;ofer&quot; (ridge, hill). A record of the name as &quot;Welnfver&quot; in 1186 seems to suggest this origin. The well or spring referred to is the River Till. The Wooler Water, part of which is also known as Happy Valley, is a tributary of the River Till and is formed by a confluence of the Harthope and Carey Burns which rise in the Cheviot Hills, to the south of Wooler.

Another possible origin is &quot;Wulfa&#x27;s hillside&quot;, from the Old English personal name &quot;Wulfa&quot; &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;őra&quot; &quot;hillside, slope&quot;, although this word in place-names usually means &quot;river mouth, shore&quot;. A record of the name as Wulloir in 1232 may suggest this origin.
It is not certain which is the actual origin.

<text>Tring is a market town and civil parish in the Borough of Dacorum, Hertfordshire, England. It is situated in a gap passing through the Chiltern Hills, classed as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, from Central London. 

Tring is linked to London by the Roman road of Akeman Street, by the modern A41 road, by the Grand Union Canal and by the West Coast Main Line to London Euston. Settlements in Tring date back to prehistoric times and it was mentioned in the Domesday Book; the town received its market charter in 1315. Tring is now largely a commuter town within the London commuter belt.
As of 2021, Tring had a population of 12,427.

==Toponymy==
The name Tring is believed to derive from the Old English &quot;Tredunga&quot; or &quot;Trehangr&quot;, &#x27;Tre&#x27; meaning &#x27;tree&#x27; and the suffix &#x27;ing&#x27; implying &#x27;a slope where trees grow&#x27;.

==History==
There is evidence of prehistoric settlement with Iron Age barrows and defensive embankments adjacent to The Ridgeway, and also later Saxon burials. The town straddles the Roman road called Akeman Street, running through as the High Street.
Tring was the dominant settlement in the area, being the primary settlement in the &quot;Hundred of Tring&quot; at the time of the Domesday Book (1086). Tring had a large population and paid a large amount of tax relative to most settlements listed in that survey. Landholdings included the manor of Treunga, assigned to Count Eustace II of Boulogne by William the Conqueror.

In 1315 the town was granted a market charter by Edward II. This charter gave Faversham Abbey the right to hold weekly markets on Tuesdays, and a ten-day fair starting on 29 June, the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul. It also prevented the creation of any rival markets within a day&#x27;s travel of the town. The tower of the Church of St Peter and St Paul was built between 1360 and 1400.

Until 1440, there was a small village east of Tring called Pendley (or &quot;Penley&quot;, &quot;Pendele&quot;, or &quot;Pentlai&quot;). The landowner Sir Robert Whittingham received a grant of free warren from King Henry VI. He enclosed 200 acres (about 80 hectares) and tore down the buildings on the land, returning the estate to pasture, and built a manor house, Pendley Manor. This house was variously inhabited by the Verney, Anderson and Harcourt families until the mid-19th century.

Tring Park Mansion was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and was built in 1682 for the owner Henry Guy, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Charles II. John Washington, the son of the Reverend Lawrence Washington and Amphyllis Twigden, was born and brought up in Tring. In 1656 he left Tring to go on a trading voyage to Virginia, but after a shipwreck on the Potomac River he remained in Virginia, married and started a family which eventually included his great-grandson, George Washington, the first President of the United States.
The town&#x27;s prosperity was greatly improved at the start of the 19th century by the construction nearby of the Grand Junction Canal, and soon afterwards in 1835 the London and Birmingham Railway. Industries which benefited included flour milling, brewing, silk weaving, lace-making and straw plaiting.

In 1835, the medieval Pendley Manor was destroyed by fire. A local landowner, Joseph Grout Williams, commissioned a new manor house to be built in Jacobean Revival style, and this building still stands today on Station Road.

In 1836 Thomas Butcher, a wholesale seed and corn merchant, and his son also called Thomas, established a private bank, Thomas Butcher &amp; Son in Tring High Street. The business was subsequently run by the next generation of the family, Frederick and George, and was also known locally as Tring Old Bank. By 1900 it had branches in Aylesbury, Chesham and Berkhamsted. From this time it became the subject of successive bank consolidations, eventually becoming a branch of the National Westminster Bank, the last to be represented in the town.

In the late 19th century the estate became the home of the Rothschild family, whose influence on the town was considerable. The site for Tring Market House was presented by to the town by Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild. His son, Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild, built a private zoological museum in Tring. This housed perhaps the largest collection of stuffed animals worldwide. It has been part of the Natural History Museum, London since 1937, and in April 2007 the museum changed its name to the Natural History Museum at Tring in order to make people more aware of the museum&#x27;s link to London&#x27;s Natural History Museum. In 1902 the 2nd Lord Rothschild also released the edible dormouse (Glis glis) into Tring Park. He used to ride around the town in a carriage drawn by zebras. In the town centre of Tring there is a pavement maze in the shape of a Zebra&#x27;s head in order to remember the link that Tring has to the Rothschild family.

The former livestock market place is now the home of a weekly Friday market and a fortnightly Saturday farmers&#x27; market. Some of the former livestock pens have been retained. The old livestock market office is now the home of the Tring Local History Museum, which opened in September 2010.

==Governance==
Tring is a part of the UK Parliament constituency of Harpenden and Berkhamsted. Victoria Collins has been the Member of Parliament (MP) since the July 2024 election.

Tring has three tiers of local government at parish (town), district, and county level: Tring Town Council, Dacorum Borough Council, and Hertfordshire County Council. Since the local elections on 2 May 2019, Tring Town Council comprises 11 Liberal Democrats and 1 Conservative.

===Administrative history===

The parish of Tring formerly included a large rural area as well as the town itself, including Long Marston and Wilstone. The parish was administered by its vestry, in the same way as most small towns and rural areas. It was included in the Berkhamsted Poor Law Union from 1835.

The &quot;Upper Hamlet&quot; of the parish of Tring, covering the town, was made a local government district with effect from 2 February 1859, governed by a local board. Following the Public Health Act 1872, such local government districts were also called urban sanitary districts. Under the Local Government Act 1894, urban sanitary districts became urban districts on 31 December 1894. The 1894 Act also stipulated that a parish could not be partly in an urban district and partly outside it. The old parish of Tring was therefore split, with the part outside the urban district becoming a separate parish called Tring Rural with effect from its first parish meeting on 4 December 1894. The Tring Rural Parish, covering Long Marston, Wilstone and the surrounding areas, was included in the Berkhamsted Rural District.

Tring Urban District Council held its first meeting on 3 January 1895 at the Vestry Hall in Church Yard. The first chairman was Frederick Butcher, who had been the last chairman of the old local board. Tring Urban District Council continued to meet at the Vestry Hall until 1910, and had an office on Western Road. It then moved its meeting place to the Market House at 61 High Street, which had been built between 1898 and 1900. The council remained at Market House until 1952, when it moved to the former Tring Park estate office at 9 High Street, remaining there until the council&#x27;s abolition.

Tring Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the district of Dacorum on 1 April 1974. A successor parish was created for the former urban district, with its parish council taking the name Tring Town Council. The former urban district council&#x27;s offices at 9 High Street became private offices, with the building being renamed the Counting House. Tring Town Council is based at the Market House at 61 High Street.

==Geography==

Tring is in west Hertfordshire, adjacent to the Buckinghamshire border, at a low point in the Chiltern Hills known as the &#x27;Tring Gap&#x27;. This has been used as a crossing point since ancient times, being at the junction of the Icknield Way and under the Romans Akeman Street, the major Roman road linking London to Cirencester. It is transected east and west by the ancient earthwork called Grim&#x27;s Dyke. It is located at the summit level of the Grand Union Canal and both the canal and railway pass through in deep cuttings. Tring railway cutting is long and an average of deep and is celebrated in a series of coloured lithographs by John Cooke Bourne showing its construction in the 1830s.

The four Tring Reservoirs – Wilstone, Tringford, Startops End and Marsworth – were built to supply water for the canal. These have been a national nature reserve since 1955, and identified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1987. Nearby, within the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty that almost surrounds the town, is the Ashridge Estate, part of the National Trust and home to Ashridge Business School.

The civil parish includes the hamlets of Little Tring, New Mill and Bulbourne to the north of Tring and Hastoe to the south.

==Flour mill==

Heygates Mill is a flour mill. Originally it was a windmill, and the company was run by William Mead. The windmill was demolished in 1910 to make way for a wheat storage silo. In those days, Mead lived on-site, in a house next to the yard, and owned half the area taken by the mill of today. The remaining space was occupied by boat-builders, Bushell Brothers, who built narrowboats for the canal. The Heygate family took over Mead&#x27;s business in 1945, and today mills 100,000 tons of wheat a year, resulting in 76,000 tons of flour. This is mainly bakers&#x27; flour, but there is also a commitment to wholemeal digestive for biscuits, bulk outlets and a large output of 1.5 kg bags from the pre-packed flour plant.

In the days of the Tring windmill, only two men operated the system, milling ten stone per hour. Now, computerised, more than twelve tons per hour are produced. Heygate&#x27;s Tring mill has 80 employees and sixteen trucks delivering throughout the south of England.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Tring railway station is located about east of the town and lies on the West Coast Main Line. It is served by London Northwestern services from to London Euston; in addition, Southern operates the cross-London service to via . The station is served by slow and semi-fast trains. 

====History====
The station was originally opened in 1837 by the London &amp; Birmingham Railway, under the direction of the railway engineer Robert Stephenson.

The remote location of Tring railway station was due to changes to the route of the railway imposed on Stephenson by local landowners such as Lord Brownlow, who wished to protect his Ashridge Estate. The location is sometimes wrongly attributed to objections, which were said to have been made by Lord Rothschild to protect his land in Tring; in fact, Lord Rothschild was not born until 1840, three years after the railway had opened, and the Tring lands were only acquired by his father Lionel in 1872. He did, however, object to a much later plan to build a steam tramway between Tring station and .

An extension of the Metropolitan Railway was once considered from , making Tring station the terminus, with connections to the main line companies serving the north; this project was not realised.

===Buses===
Bus services in Tring are operated by Arriva, Red Rose Travel and Red Eagle. Key direct destinations include Aylesbury, Dunstable, Hemel Hempstead, Luton and Watford. 

===Roads===
In 1973, the A41 Tring bypass was opened. The bypass runs through Tring Park and was originally conceived as the first stretch of a new motorway, the A41(M), which was planned to run from the M25 at Hunton Bridge to Aylesbury; the project was not realised and the bypass was downgraded to trunk road status. In 1993, the A41 bypass was extended with of grade-separated dual carriageway that links the Tring bypass to the M25.

<text>Woburn (, meaning twisted or crooked stream) is a town and civil parish in Bedfordshire, England, about southeast of Milton Keynes and south of junction 13 of the M1 motorway. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 933.

==History==

Woburn was first recorded as a hamlet in 969 and is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is best known as the location of Woburn Abbey (a stately home) and Woburn Safari Park. The abbey was founded by Cistercian monks in 1145 and granted to the first Earl of Bedford in 1538 after the dissolution of the monasteries. The town may have been called &quot;Woburne Chapell&quot; in medieval times, in order to distinguish it from the abbey. Woburn has been burned down and rebuilt three times. A medieval chimney fire spread owing to the prevalence of thatched roofs and closely built houses. Then, during the English Civil War, the Cavaliers burned down much of the town and in 1724 a third fire destroyed much of the town, which was rebuilt in the Georgian style that remains today.

During the nineteenth century, Woburn was an important staging post on the LondonNewport PagnellNorthampton turnpike. The town had 27 inns and the first 24-hour post office outside London. However, with Woburn being bypassed by (what became) the West Coast Main Line and the Grand Union canal (northsouth) and the Varsity Line (eastwest), Woburn&#x27;s location ceased to be so significant. The population fell from 2,100 in 1851 to 700 about a century later. 

Woburn Town Hall, designed by Edward Blore, was completed in 1830. Under the 8th Duke of Bedford, a new parish church was completed in Woburn in 1868. It was equipped with a crypt beneath, which was originally intended as the burial place of the Dukes of Bedford and their family. In the end the dukes continued to use the ancient mausoleum at St Michael&#x27;s, Chenies, and the crypt of St Mary&#x27;s parish church in Woburn is now used for events and meetings. The hatch through which coffins would have been lowered into the crypt is still visible.

Woburn Cottage Hospital was established by Mary, the Duchess of Bedford (1865-1937) in 1898. The hospital remained open until at least 1935.
Despite burning down three times in its history, the first permanent fire station was only recorded in 1823, situated in front of the Tudor School. The station moved in 1947 to purpose-built premises on Leighton Street. Today a modern fire station stands on London Road.

<text>Pershore () is a market town and civil parish in the Wychavon district in Worcestershire, England, on the banks of the River Avon. At the 2011 census, the population was 7,125. The town is best known for Pershore Abbey. Pershore is situated west of Evesham and east of Upton-upon-Severn in the Vale of Evesham.

==History==
The town contains examples of Georgian architecture. In 1964 the Council for British Archaeology included Pershore in its list of 51 British &quot;Gem Towns&quot; worthy of special consideration for historic preservation, and it has been listed as an outstanding conservation area. Parts of the abbey, which stand in an expanse of public grassland close to the centre of the town, date from the 11th century. The current structure is far smaller than the original building, which was plundered during the reign of Henry VIII at the Dissolution. The original nave was destroyed. The north transept collapsed later. The present nave occupies the western part of what would originally have been the choir. Pershore Town Hall, which was originally built as the local post office, was completed in 1932.

==Education==
Schools in Pershore follow the three-tier first school (ages 5–9), middle school (ages 9–12), high school (ages 11–18) system practised by parts of Worcestershire County Council. Pershore High School has a sixth form with all-weather sports pitches and sports hall.

Abbey Park First School and Abbey Park Middle School are on Abbey Road, they are both situated down the same drive. Pershore High School is on Station Road, which is on the outskirts of Pershore, bordering Pinvin, a small village.

Holy Redeemer Roman Catholic Primary School, situated on Priest Lane beside Holy Redeemer, Pershore&#x27;s only Catholic church, stands outside the 3-tier model. It is a primary school (ages 5–11) which acts as a feeder school to Blessed Edward Oldcorne Catholic College in Worcester.

Pershore College, a school of horticulture and other land-based activities, became a campus for Warwickshire College (now WCG) following a merger in 2007.

==Annual events==
===Plum Festival===
The Pershore Plum Festival is held in August to celebrate the local tradition of growing plums including the local varieties Pershore Purple, Pershore Yellow Egg Plum and Pershore Emblem. Activities include crowning the plum princess, a family fun run, plum themed art exhibition and the Plum Fayre. There is also a classic car rally and nearby Worcester Racecourse revived &quot;The Land O&#x27;Plums Chase&quot; from 72 years ago. The festival won the Best Tourism Event and Festival in the Worcestershire Welcome Awards 2011.

<text>Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II Tryphon (, &quot;Ptolemaĩos Euergétēs Tryphōn&quot;, &quot;Ptolemy the Benefactor, the Opulent&quot;; c. 184 BC – 28 June 116 BC), nicknamed Physcon (, &quot;Physkōn&quot;, &quot;Fatty&quot;), was a king of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. He was the younger son of King Ptolemy V and Queen Cleopatra I. His reign was characterised by fierce political and military conflict with his older siblings, Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II.

Ptolemy VIII was originally made co-ruler with his siblings in the run-up to the Sixth Syrian War, in 170 BC. In the course of that war, Ptolemy VI was captured and Ptolemy VIII arguably became sole king of Egypt. When the war ended and Ptolemy VI was restored to the throne in 168 BC, the two brothers continued to quarrel. In 164 BC Ptolemy VIII drove out his brother and became sole king of the Ptolemaic empire, but he was expelled in turn in 163 BC. As a result of Roman intervention, Ptolemy VIII was awarded control of Cyrene. From there he repeatedly tried to capture Cyprus, which had also been promised to him by the Romans, from his brother.

After Ptolemy VI&#x27;s death in 145 BC, Ptolemy VIII returned to Egypt as co-ruler and spouse of his sister Cleopatra II. His cruel treatment of the opposition and his decision to marry his niece Cleopatra III and promote her to the status of co-regent led to a civil war from 132/1 to 127/6 BC, in which Cleopatra II controlled Alexandria and enjoyed the support of the Greek population of the country, while Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III controlled most of the rest of Egypt and were supported by the native Egyptians. During this war, native Egyptians were promoted to the highest echelons of the Ptolemaic government for the first time. Ptolemy VIII was victorious and ruled alongside Cleopatra II and Cleopatra III until his death in 116 BC.

The ancient Greek sources on Ptolemy VIII are extremely hostile, characterising him as cruel and mocking him as fat and degenerate, as part of a contrast with Ptolemy VI, whom they present extremely positively. The historian Günther Hölbl calls him &quot;one of the most brutal and at the same time one of the shrewdest politicians of the Hellenistic Age.&quot;

==Background and early life==

Ptolemy VIII was the younger son of Ptolemy V, who reigned from 204 to 180 BC. Ptolemy V&#x27;s reign had been dominated by the Fifth Syrian War (204–198 BC), in which the Ptolemaic realm fought against the Seleucid king Antiochus III, who ruled the Near East and Asia Minor. In that war, Antiochus III had completely defeated the Ptolemaic forces, annexed Coele-Syria and Judaea to his empire, and reduced Egypt to a subordinate position. The new situation was solidified with a peace treaty, in which Ptolemy V married Antiochus III&#x27;s daughter Cleopatra I in 194 BC. Ptolemy VI was the eldest son of the couple, born in 186 BC, and was the heir to the throne from birth. They also had a daughter, Cleopatra II. Their youngest child, Ptolemy VIII, was probably born around 184 BC.

The defeat in the Fifth Syrian War cast a shadow over the rest of Ptolemy V&#x27;s reign. One prominent faction within the Ptolemaic court agitated for a return to war in order to restore Egyptian prestige, while another faction resisted the expense involved in rebuilding and remilitarising the realm. When Ptolemy V died unexpectedly in September 180 BC, at the age of only 30, he was succeeded by Ptolemy VI. Since the new king was only six years old, actual power rested with the regents - first Cleopatra I (180–178/7 BC) and then Eulaeus and Lenaeus (178/7–170 BC). These regents were more closely associated with the peaceful faction and, as a result, members of the warhawk faction seem to have begun to look to the young Ptolemy VIII as a potential figurehead for their movement.

==First reign (170–163 BC)==
===Accession and the Sixth Syrian War (170–168 BC)===

The Seleucid king Seleucus IV, who had followed a generally peaceful policy, was murdered in 175 BC, and after two months of conflict his brother Antiochus IV secured the throne. The unsettled situation empowered the warhawks in the Ptolemaic court and Eulaeus and Lenaeus made efforts to conciliate them. By 172 BC, they seem to have embraced the warhawks&#x27; position.

In October 170 BC, Ptolemy VIII, now about sixteen, was promoted to the status of co-regent and incorporated into the Ptolemaic dynastic cult as one of the &quot;Theoi Philomētores&quot; (Mother-loving gods) alongside his brother and sister, who had now been married to one another. The current year was declared the first year of a new era. John Grainger argues that these ceremonies were intended to paper over the factional differences that had developed in the court and to promote unity in the run-up to war. Ptolemy VI remained the senior king, as demonstrated later in 170 BC by the declaration of Ptolemy VI&#x27;s adulthood and the celebration of his coming-of-age ceremony (the &quot;anakleteria&quot;), marking the formal end of the regency government. In practice, however, the regents Eulaeus and Lenaeus remained in charge of the government.

The Sixth Syrian War broke out shortly after this, probably in early 169 BC. Ptolemy VIII probably remained in Alexandria, while the Ptolemaic army set out from the border fort of Pelusium to invade Palestine. The Ptolemaic army was intercepted and decimated by Antiochus IV&#x27;s army in the Sinai. The defeated army withdrew to the Nile Delta, while Antiochus seized Pelusium and then moved on the Delta.

As a result of this defeat, Eulaeus and Lenaeus were toppled by a military coup and replaced with two prominent Ptolemaic generals, Comanus and Cineas. As Antiochus IV advanced on Alexandria, Ptolemy VI went out to meet him. They negotiated an agreement of friendship, which in effect reduced Egypt to a Seleucid client state. When news of the agreement reached Alexandria, the people of the city rioted. Comanus and Cineas rejected the agreement, rejected Ptolemy VI&#x27;s authority and declared Ptolemy VIII the sole king (Cleopatra II&#x27;s position remained unchanged). Antiochus IV responded by placing Alexandria under siege, but he was unable to take the city and withdrew from Egypt in September 169 BC, as winter approached, leaving Ptolemy VI as his puppet king in Memphis and retaining a garrison in Pelusium.

Within two months, Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra II reconciled with Ptolemy VI and he returned to Alexandria as their co-regent. The restored government repudiated the agreement that Ptolemy VI had made with Antiochus IV and began to recruit new troops from Greece. In response, in spring 168 BC, Antiochus IV invaded Egypt for a second time. Officially, this invasion was justified by the claim that Ptolemy VIII had unjustly appropriated his older brother&#x27;s authority. Antiochus IV quickly occupied Memphis and was crowned king of Egypt and advanced on Alexandria. However, the Ptolemies had appealed to Rome for help over the winter and a Roman embassy led by Gaius Popillius Laenas confronted Antiochus at the town of Eleusis and forced him to agree to a settlement, bringing the war to an end.

===From joint rule to sole rule (168–163 BC)===

Initially, the joint rule of the two brothers and Cleopatra II, which had been established during the war, continued. However, the complete failure of the Egyptian forces in the Sixth Syrian War had left the Ptolemaic monarchy&#x27;s prestige seriously diminished and it caused a permanent rift between Ptolemy VI and Ptolemy VIII.

In 165 BC, Dionysius Petosarapis, a prominent courtier who appears to have been of native Egyptian origin, attempted to take advantage of the conflict between the brothers in order to take control of the government. He announced to the people of Alexandria that Ptolemy VI had tried to get him to assassinate Ptolemy VIII and tried to whip up a mob to support him. Ptolemy VI managed to convince Ptolemy VIII that the charges were untrue and the two brothers appeared publicly together in the stadium, defusing the crisis. Dionysius fled the city and convinced some military contingents to mutiny. Heavy fighting took place in the Fayyum over the next year. This and another revolt in the Thebaid – the latest in a series of rebellions that had attempted to overthrow the Ptolemies and re-establish native Egyptian rule. Ptolemy VI successfully suppressed the rebellion after a bitter siege at Panopolis.

Late in 164 BC, probably not long after Ptolemy VI had returned from the south, Ptolemy VIII, who was now about twenty years old, somehow ousted Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II from power. Ptolemy VI fled to Rome and then Cyprus. The exact course of events is not known, but Diodorus Siculus reports that the instigator of the expulsion was a man named Timotheus, who then became the dominant minister. Ptolemy VIII now assumed the epithet &quot;Euergetēs&quot; (&#x27;benefactor&#x27;), which recalled his ancestor Ptolemy III and distinguished him from Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II who both bore the epithet &quot;Philomētōr&quot;. Ptolemy VIII is said to have behaved tyrannically, and his minister Timotheus used torture and arbitrary executions to eliminate his enemies. In summer 163 BC, the people of Alexandria rioted against Ptolemy VIII, expelling him in turn and recalling Ptolemy VI.

==Reign in Cyrenaica (163–145 BC)==
On his return to power, a pair of Roman agents convinced Ptolemy VI to grant Ptolemy VIII control of Cyrenaica. Ptolemy VIII departed for Cyrene, but he was not satisfied. In late 163 or early 162 BC, he went to Rome to request help. The Senate was convinced that the division was unfair, declaring that Ptolemy VIII ought to receive Cyprus as well. The ancient historian Polybius believed that the Senate made this decision with the conscious goal of weakening Ptolemaic power. Titus Manlius Torquatus and Gnaeus Cornelius Merula were sent as envoys to force Ptolemy VI to concede this. From Rome, Ptolemy VIII went to Greece where he recruited soldiers in preparation for an expedition to seize Cyprus by force. He had sailed to Rhodes with this fleet when he encountered Torquatus and Merula, who convinced him to discharge his troops and return to Cyrene. He went to the border between Egypt and Cyrene, waiting with a force of 1,000 Cretan mercenaries at a small town just west of Paraetonium for the results of the Roman negotiations with Ptolemy VI. Ptolemy VIII had been waiting there for forty days when Ptolemy Sempetesis, the governor that Ptolemy VIII had left in charge of Cyrene in his absence, suddenly raised a revolt. Ptolemy VIII marched to suppress the revolt and was defeated in battle. He regained control over Cyrene by the end of 162 BC, but it is not known whether he achieved this by negotiation or military action.

However, when Torquatus and Merula arrived in Alexandria, Ptolemy VI successfully put them off until he heard about the revolt, at which point he refused their demands. They had to return to Rome without achieving their goal. In winter 162/61 BC, the Roman Senate responded to this by breaking off relations with Ptolemy VI and to grant Ptolemy VIII permission to use force to take control of Cyprus, but they offered him no tangible support. He launched a military expedition to Cyprus in 161 BC. This expedition lasted up to a year, before fierce Cypriot resistance forced him to abandon the enterprise.

In 156 or 155 BC, Ptolemy VIII faced a failed assassination attempt, which he attributed to his older brother. Ptolemy VIII went to Rome and displaying the scars he had received in the attempt to the Senate. As a result of the embassy, the Roman Senate agreed to send a second embassy in 154 BC, led by Gnaeus Cornelius Merula and Lucius Minucius Thermus, with an honour guard of troops, in order to enforce the transfer of Cyprus to Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s control. Ptolemy VIII was besieged by his older brother at Lapethus and was captured. Ptolemy VIII was persuaded to withdraw from Cyprus, in exchange for continued possession of Cyrenaica, an annual payment of grain, and a promise of marriage to one of Ptolemy VI&#x27;s infant daughters (probably Cleopatra Thea) once she came of age.

===Relations with Rome===

Throughout his time as king in Cyrene, Ptolemy VIII maintained extremely close relations with Rome. From 162 BC, he was an official &quot;amicus et socius&quot; (friend and ally) of the Roman Republic. During his time in Rome he is said to have met Cornelia. In 152 BC, after the death of her husband, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, Ptolemy VIII allegedly asked for her hand in marriage, which she refused. This encounter was popular in neoclassical art, but it is unlikely that it ever actually took place. Even if untrue, the story may reflect close ties between Ptolemy VIII and the gentes Cornelia and Sempronia. By contrast, Ptolemy VI seems to have maintained ties with Cato the Elder.

An inscription from 155 BC, set up in the aftermath of the assassination attempt records Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s will, in which he bequeaths Cyrenaica to Rome if he died childless. This act is not mentioned by any literary source but it fits with the very close alignment between Ptolemy VIII and the Romans that is attested in the literary sources. Similar testaments are known from other contemporary monarchs, notably Attalus III of Pergamum. They were often used by monarchs as an attempt to protect themselves from assassination or coup. Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s will would be the earliest example of this practice. L. Criscuolo has argued that the inscription of Ptolemy&#x27;s will is actually a forgery produced by the Romans after they gained control of Cyrenaica in 96 BC. However, it is quite possible that the text of the testament itself is authentic, but was only publicly disseminated in inscriptions by the Romans after they took over the country.

=== Relations with Numidia ===
Ptolemy VIII maintained a significant relationship with Numidia, highlighted by his close friendship with King Massinissa. This connection was established in 163 BC when Ptolemy VIII ascended to the throne of Cyrene. During this period, Massinissa was renowned for fostering relationships with Greek states and promoting a policy of Hellenization. Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s interactions with Numidia were notably demonstrated by the dedication of a bust to Massinissa&#x27;s son, Mastanabal, a distinguished athlete.

The two rulers are believed to have met between 163 and 148 BC, with a plausible location being Massinissa&#x27;s main residence at Cirta. While the exact details of their meeting remain uncertain, Athenaeus&#x27; references to Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s Memoirs suggest the occurrence of a banquet hosted by Massinissa. During this event, Massinissa reportedly expressed astonishment at the Syracusans&#x27; preference for pet monkeys over children, an anecdote recounted by Ptolemy VIII.

===Spectacle and construction===
As king of Cyrene, Ptolemy VIII attempted to display the Hellenistic royal virtue of &quot;tryphe&quot; (luxury). The main priesthood in Cyrene was the position of the priest of Apollo. Ptolemy VIII assumed this position and discharged his duties, especially the hosting of feasts, extremely sumptuously. He also engaged in a wide-ranging construction project in the city. A large tomb west of Ptolemais seems to have been intended as his final resting place.

==Second reign (145–132/131 BC)==
Ptolemy VI died on campaign in Syria in 145 BC. Ptolemy VI may have intended for his seven-year-old son, also named Ptolemy, to succeed him, but the Alexandrians called on Ptolemy VIII to return from Cyrene, assume the kingship and marry his older sister, Cleopatra II. The royal couple were incorporated into the dynastic cult as the &quot;Theoi Euergetai&quot; (&#x27;benefactor gods&#x27;) - Cleopatra II having previously been one of the &quot;Theoi Philomētores&quot; with Ptolemy VI. Ptolemy VIII was inaugurated as pharaoh at Memphis in 144 or 143 BC, during which time the couple&#x27;s only child, Ptolemy Memphites, was born.

On his return to Alexandria in 145 BC, Ptolemy VIII is reported to have launched a purge of those who had opposed him and supported Ptolemy VI. This purge is luridly described in the literary sources, though it is sometimes difficult to determine whether specific anecdotes belong to this event or his later reconquest of Alexandria in 126 BC. Justin reports that Ptolemy VIII let his soldiers rampage through the streets of Alexandria, murdering indiscriminately, until he was &quot;left alone with his soldiers in so large a city, and found himself a king, not of men, but of empty houses.&quot; Valerius Maximus says that when the young men of Alexandria took refuge in the gymnasion, Ptolemy VIII set the building on fire. It is probably in this period that Ptolemy VIII gained a number of pejorative nicknames, including &quot;Physkōn&quot; (&quot;fatty&quot;) and &quot;Kakergetēs&quot; (&quot;Malefactor&quot;) - a pun on his official epithet &quot;Euergetēs&quot; (&quot;Benefactor&quot;). His accession also marked the end of Ptolemaic presence in the Aegean Sea. Within months of his accession, he had withdrawn all troops from Itanos, Thera, and Methana, the last remaining Ptolemaic bases in the Aegean. The Ptolemaic empire was now limited to Egypt, Cyprus, and Cyrene.

Ptolemy VIII probably had his young nephew Ptolemy murdered. According to Justin, Ptolemy VIII did the deed personally, on the night of his wedding to Cleopatra II in 145 BC, and the boy died in his mother&#x27;s arms. Documentary evidence from papyri indicates that in reality, the boy was initially maintained as heir and only removed sometime after the birth of Ptolemy Memphites, since in c. 143 BC, Ptolemy the son of Ptolemy VI served as eponymous priest of Alexander the Great. By the late 140s BC, Ptolemy Memphites had been declared heir, and was depicted as king on reliefs of the Temple of Edfu, although there is no evidence for any co-regency between him and his father.

Between 142 and 139 BC, Ptolemy VIII married Cleopatra III, daughter of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II, and made her co-ruler, without divorcing Cleopatra II. According to Livy, Ptolemy VIII had initiated a relationship with his niece shortly after his accession which he now made official. Daniel Ogden has argued that the marriage to Cleopatra III may not have been planned from the outset, but a measure taken to prevent her from being married to someone else who might use that marriage in order to claim the throne. However, the new arrangement led to conflict with Cleopatra II.

Apparently in response to this new marriage and with the support of Cleopatra II, an Athamanian mercenary captain formerly in Ptolemaic service, Galaestes, initiated a revolt. Galaestes had been a trusted officer under Ptolemy VI but had been forced into exile in 145 BC. In Greece, he gathered an army of other Ptolemaic exiles, then announced that he had a young son of Ptolemy VI in his care and crowned this boy as king. Galaestes attacked Ptolemy VIII, intending to put this child on the throne. Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s mercenaries, whose pay was in arrears, nearly defected to the challenger, but their commander, Hierax, prevented this by paying their wages from his own money. By February 139 BC, Galaestes had been defeated and Ptolemy VIII had issued a decree affirming the rights and privileges of the Egyptian priesthood, in which he represented himself, Cleopatra II, and Cleopatra III as harmoniously ruling together.

In the same year, Ptolemy VIII received a Roman embassy, led by Scipio Aemilianus, which was intended to effect a peaceful settlement of all affairs in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ancient sources emphasise the sumptuous greeting that the Romans received, mostly in order to contrast it with the austere behaviour of the Romans. By this point he was apparently enormously fat and was transported everywhere in a litter.

==Civil war (132–126 BC)==
In late 132 BC, the conflict between the royal siblings finally erupted into open warfare, with Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III on one side opposing Cleopatra II on the other. At first, Ptolemy retained control of Alexandria, but in late 131 BC the people of Alexandria rioted in favour of Cleopatra II and set fire to the royal palace. Ptolemy VIII, Cleopatra III, and their children escaped to Cyprus. Cleopatra II meanwhile had herself crowned as sole queen - the first time that a Ptolemaic woman had done this - and assumed the title of &quot;Thea Philomētōr Sōteira&quot; (&quot;Mother-loving, Saviour Goddess&quot;), which served to link her to her deceased husband Ptolemy VI and to the dynastic founder, Ptolemy I.

Although Alexandria had sided with Cleopatra II and she tended to be supported by Greeks and Jews throughout the country, Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III were more popular with the native Egyptian population. Most of Egypt continued to acknowledge Ptolemy VIII as king. In the south of the country, however, a man named Harsiesi took advantage of the chaos to rebel - following in the footsteps of the rebellion of Hugronaphor and Ankhmakis (206-185 BC). Harsiesi probably declared himself Pharaoh and managed to seize control of Thebes in August or September of 131 BC. He was expelled in November and pursued by Paos, the &quot;strategos&quot; of the Thebaid, who was also an Egyptian.

Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III had returned from Cyprus to Egypt by the beginning of 130 BC. By spring, they were in charge of Memphis. Impressed by Paos&#x27; success against Harsiesi, they promoted him to command over the whole of Upper Egypt and put him in charge of the whole military apparatus - the first time that a native Egyptian had held such a prominent position. Harsiesi was finally captured and executed in September 130 BC. Alexandria was placed under siege but Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III were unable to capture it. Cleopatra II also maintained strongholds throughout the country – Harmonthis in the Thebaid was still under her control in October 130 BC. In the context of the struggle between Cleopatra II and Ptolemy VIII, the latter eliminated his two eldest sons: one was summoned from Cyrene (this was possibly the son of Cleopatra II by Ptolemy VI) and killed on the suspicion that the Alexandrians would make him king; the other, Ptolemy Memphites, the son of Cleopatra II by Ptolemy VIII, was about twelve years old, when his father killed him and sent the dismembered pieces back to Cleopatra II on her birthday. Both parties appealed to Rome, but the Senate did not intervene in the conflict.

Growing desperate, in 129 BC Cleopatra II offered the throne of Egypt to her son-in-law, the Seleucid king Demetrius II, who had just returned to power after years in Parthian captivity. Demetrius II launched an invasion of Egypt in 128 BC, but his forces were still in the eastern desert, besieging the border fortress of Pelusium, when news arrived that his wife, Cleopatra II&#x27;s daughter Cleopatra Thea, had installed their son Antiochus VIII as king of Syria. The Seleucid troops mutinied and Demetrius II had to return to Syria.
In order to prevent Demetrius II from returning once he had dealt with these revolts, Ptolemy VIII agreed to a request that he had received from a group of rebels in Syria, who had asked him to send them a royal pretender to lead them. Ptolemy VIII selected Alexander II, whom he presented as the son of an earlier Seleucid king, Alexander I ( BC). The resulting conflict in the Seleucid realm continued for years and meant that Seleucid intervention in opposition to Ptolemy VIII was no longer possible.

In 127 BC, Cleopatra II took her treasury and fled Alexandria for the court of Demetrius II. In her absence, Ptolemy VIII finally reconquered Alexandria. This reconquest was accompanied by a bloody purge of the supporters of Cleopatra II. It is difficult to tell whether various anecdotes recording the bloody slaughter that Ptolemy VIII presided over belong to this event or to the earlier purge of 145 BC.

==Third reign (127/126–116 BC)==

After this, Ptolemy VIII began negotiations to reconcile with Cleopatra II and the Seleucid court. In 124 BC, Ptolemy VIII abandoned his support for Alexander II and agreed to support Demetrius II&#x27;s son Antiochus VIII instead. He sealed the agreement by sending his second daughter by Cleopatra III, Tryphaena, to marry Antiochus VIII. Cleopatra II returned to Egypt from the Seleucid court and was once more acknowledged as co-regent with Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III. She appears along with them in papyrus documents from July 124 BC onwards.

The reconciliation of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III with Cleopatra II was nevertheless a long process. To solidify their reconciliation and restore peace and prosperity to Egypt, the royal trio issued the Amnesty Decree in April 118 BC, which survives in a number of papyrus copies. This decree pardoned all crimes other than murder and temple robbing committed before 118 BC, encouraged refugees to return home and reclaim their property, waived all back-taxes, confirmed land grants made to soldiers during the civil war, affirmed temple land holdings and tax privileges, and instructed tax officials to use standardised weights and measures on pain of death. In addition, the decree established the jurisdiction of courts in legal disputes between Egyptians and Greeks. Henceforth, this would be determined by the language that the documents at the heart of the legal dispute were written in: the &quot;chrematistai&quot; (money-judges) would decide disputes over Greek documents, while the &quot;laokritai&quot; (folk-judges) would resolve disputes over Egyptian documents. The &quot;chrematistai&quot; were no longer allowed to drag Egyptians into their courts, as had apparently been occurring previously.

Ptolemy VIII died on 28 June 116 BC. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Ptolemy IX, alongside Cleopatra II and Cleopatra III. Justin reports that he left the throne to Cleopatra III and whichever of her sons she preferred. Although she preferred her younger son, Ptolemy X, the people of Alexandria forced her to choose Ptolemy IX. This account is probably a false one, invented after Ptolemy IX was deposed by Ptolemy X.

==Regime==
===Ptolemaic dynastic cult===
Ptolemaic Egypt had a dynastic cult, which centred on the Ptolemaia festival and the annual priest of Alexander the Great, whose full title included the names of all the Ptolemaic ruling couples and appeared in official documents as part of the date formula. In October 170 BC when Ptolemy VIII first became co-regent with his brother and sister, who were already worshipped as the &quot;Theoi Philomētores&quot; (&quot;Mother-loving Gods&quot;), he was simply added to their cult as a third &quot;Mother-loving God&quot;. When he seized sole power in 164 BC, he seems to have assumed the new epithet &quot;Euergetēs&quot; (&quot;Benefactor God&quot;), but it is not clear what the implications of this were for the dynastic cult. After his expulsion from Alexandria in 163 BC, the &quot;Theoi Philomētores&quot; are attested once more.

At the start of his second reign in 145 BC, Ptolemy VIII was definitely incorporated into the dynastic cult, with him and Cleopatra II becoming the &quot;Theoi Euergetai&quot; (&#x27;Benefactor Gods&#x27;). Cleopatra III was added as a third Benefactor god in 142 or 141 BC, some time before she married Ptolemy VIII and was promoted to the status of co-regent. During the period of the civil war, Cleopatra II removed the &quot;Theoi Euergetai&quot; from the dynastic cult in Alexandria, but Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III maintained their own rival priest of Alexander from 130 BC until they recovered Alexandria in 127 BC. He is distinguished in documents as the &#x27;Priest of Alexander... in the king&#x27;s camp.&#x27; The situation before the civil war was restored in 124 BC after Ptolemy VIII reconciled with his sister, and it continued until Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s death.

From May 118 BC, shortly after the final reconciliation of the royal trio, a new king was incorporated into the dynastic cult, &quot;Theos Neos Philopatōr&quot; (&quot;New Father-loving God&quot;). This was a posthumous cult for one of the princes killed by Ptolemy VIII, either Ptolemy, the son of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II, or Ptolemy Memphites, the son of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra II. In recent scholarship, Ptolemy Memphites is generally the preferred candidate, with his deification serving as an indication that the prince had posthumously reconciled with his father and murderer.

Since the death of Arsinoe II, deceased Ptolemaic queens had been honoured with a separate dynastic cult of their own, including a separate priestess who marched in religious processions in Alexandria behind the priest of Alexander the Great and whose names also appeared in dating formulae. In 131 or 130 BC, Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III took advantage of this tradition, in their conflict against Cleopatra II, by establishing a new priesthood in honour of Cleopatra III. This new position was called the &#x27;Hieros Polos (sacred foal) of Isis, Great Mother of the Gods&#x27; and was placed immediately after the priest of Alexander and ahead of all the priestesses of the previous queens in the order of precedence. The position was unlike the previous priesthoods in that it was established for a living queen rather than a deceased one and because the holder was a priest rather than a priestess. The position is not attested after 105 BC.

===Pharaonic ideology and traditional Egyptian religion===

From the beginning of the Ptolemaic dynasty, the Ptolemies had taken on the traditional role of the Egyptian pharaoh and pursued a symbiotic alliance with the Egyptian priestly elite. The degree of investment of the Ptolemies in this aspect of their rulership steadily increased over the third and second centuries BC. Ptolemy VIII nevertheless represents a new stage in this process, since in the conflict with Cleopatra II he proved more popular among his Egyptian subjects than among his Greek ones.

In the Amnesty decree that announced the reconciliation of Ptolemy VIII, Cleopatra III, and Cleopatra II in 118 BC, the royal trio undertook to support reconstruction and repair work at temples throughout Egypt. They also promised to pay for the mummification and entombment of the Apis and Mnevis bulls.

===Alexandrian Scholarship===
Ptolemy VIII was an active participant in Greek scholarship, especially philology. He is reported to have written a study of Homer at some point before 145 BC and twenty-four books of &quot;Hypomnemata&quot; (&#x27;Notes&#x27;), a miscellaneous collection of paradoxography, including stories about historical and contemporary monarchs, as well as exotic wildlife, and other topics. The surviving fragments are collected in Felix Jacoby&#x27;s &quot;Fragmente der griechischen Historiker&quot;

Despite this interest, Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s reign saw a serious decline in the importance of Alexandria as an intellectual centre, in part due to the massacres that he carried out on taking control of the city in 145 BC and again in 126 BC. Among his victims on the first occasion were a number of prominent intellectuals, including Aristarchus of Samothrace and Apollodorus of Athens. The rest of the Alexandrian intellectuals appear to have been sent into exile, mostly relocating to Athens or Rhodes.

===Indian Ocean trade===

The Ptolemies had long retained a network of trading stations throughout the Red Sea, which enabled them to acquire gold, ivory, and elephants from the Horn of Africa. In the very last years of Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s reign these sailors discovered that the annual reversal of the Indian Monsoon Current made it possible to cross the Indian Ocean by sea in summer and then return in winter. The first Greek to make this journey was Eudoxus of Cyzicus, who is reported to have travelled to India in 118 BC and again in 116 BC. The discovery opened up the possibility of direct seaborne trade with India. Previously, trade between the Mediterranean region and India had relied on intermediaries - sailors from the Arabian centres in the Gulf of Aden and the Persian Gulf and then desert caravans led by the Nabataeans to carry goods across the Arabian desert to the Mediterranean coast. Henceforth sailors from Ptolemaic Egypt began to make the full journey themselves. This marks the beginning of the Indian Ocean trade, which would become a major part of the Eurasian economic world system that operated from the first century BC until the fourth century AD.

==Marriages and issue==
Ptolemy VIII married his older sister, Cleopatra II, on his accession in 145 BC. They had one son:
In 142 or 141 BC, Ptolemy VIII also married his niece Cleopatra III, daughter of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II. They had a number of children:
By a concubine, perhaps Eirene, Ptolemy VIII had further issue:
==Numbering==
The numbering of the Ptolemaic kings, like any Hellenistic monarchs, is a modern scholarly convention; at most, ancient sources informally distinguished between like-named kings by their epithets or nicknames, and sometimes numbered those if they repeated: thus, our Ptolemy VIII Euergetes is &quot;[Ptolemy] Euergetes II&quot; in the &quot;Canon of Ptolemy&quot;. Trying to synchronize the testimony of the narrative sources and epigraphic evidence, and misled by the appearance of additional royal names in the lists of deified Ptolemies, modern scholarship at one time numbered Ptolemy Eupator as a &quot;predecessor&quot; of Ptolemy VI Philometor (making the latter &quot;Ptolemy VII Philometor&quot;) and Ptolemy Neos Philopator as a &quot;predecessor&quot; of Ptolemy VIII Euergetes (making the latter &quot;Ptolemy IX Euergetes&quot;). Once it was determined that the listing in the dynastic cult reflected the order of death and deification, not reign, and that Ptolemy Eupator was a son and co-regent of Ptolemy VI Philometor who never became sole or senior monarch, he ceased to be numbered, leaving his father as &quot;Ptolemy VI Philometor&quot; (making his uncle &quot;Ptolemy VIII Euergetes&quot;). However, it was only recently established that Ptolemy Neos Philopator was never sole or senior monarch (and probably never even co-regent); even if identified with the surviving son of Ptolemy VI Philometor (current research favors Ptolemy Memphites, son of Ptolemy VIII Euergetes, instead), and even if he had reigned in 145 BC (which he did not), since Ptolemy VIII Euergetes became king as co-regent (in 170 BC) and as sole monarch (in 164 BC) long before any of his nephews and sons, he would be &quot;Ptolemy VII Euergetes&quot;. However, to avoid causing confusion with a large body of accummulated literature already labeling him &quot;Ptolemy VIII Euergetes&quot;, most scholars have continued to refer to him with that numbering. Nevertheless, Ptolemy VIII Euergetes sometimes appears, correctly but potentially confusingly, as &quot;Ptolemy VII Euergetes&quot;. To avoid potential confusion, it is recommended to append the epithet and/or nickname of Ptolemaic kings to their names in addition to the numbering.

<text>Susan Kaye McClary (born October 2, 1946) is an American musicologist associated with &quot;new musicology&quot;. Noted for her work combining musicology with feminist music criticism, McClary is professor of musicology at Case Western Reserve University.

==Early life and education==
McClary was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and received her BA in 1968 from Southern Illinois University. She attended graduate school at Harvard University where she received her MA in 1971 and her PhD in 1976. Her doctoral dissertation was on the transition from modal to tonal organization in Monteverdi&#x27;s works. The first half of her dissertation was later reworked and expanded in her 2004 book, &quot;Modal Subjectivities: Self-fashioning in the Italian Madrigal&quot;. She taught at the University of Minnesota (1977–1991), McGill University (1991–1994), University of California, Berkeley (1993), and University of California, Los Angeles (1994–2011), before becoming a Professor of Musicology at Case Western Reserve University. She has also held a five-year professorship at the University of Oslo (2007–2012).

==Career==
One of her best known works is &quot;Feminine Endings&quot; (1991). &quot;Feminine ending&quot; is a musical term once commonly used to denote a weak phrase ending or cadence. The work covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse, and discursive strategies of women musicians.

McClary suggests that sonata form may be interpreted as sexist or misogynistic and imperialistic, and that, &quot;tonality itself – with its process of instilling expectations and subsequently withholding promised fulfillment until climax – is the principal musical means during the period from 1600 to 1900 for arousing and channeling desire.&quot; She interprets the sonata procedure for its constructions of gender and sexual identity. The primary, &quot;masculine&quot; key (or first subject group) represents the male self, while the secondary, &quot;feminine&quot; key (or second subject group), represents the other, a territory to be explored and conquered, assimilated into the self and stated in the tonic home key.

McClary set the feminist arguments of her early book in a broader sociopolitical context with &quot;Conventional Wisdom&quot; (2000). In it, she argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of &quot;purely musical&quot; elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the classical canon most prized by musicologists. She examines the creation of meanings and identities, some oppressive and hegemonic, some affirmative and resistant, in music through the referencing of musical conventions in the blues, Vivaldi, Prince, Philip Glass, and others.

While seen by some as extremely radical, her work is influenced by musicologists such as Edward T. Cone, gender theorists and cultural critics such as Teresa de Lauretis, and others who, like McClary, fall in between, such as Theodor Adorno. McClary herself admits that her analyses, though intended to deconstruct, engage in essentialism.

==&quot;Constructions of Subjectivity in Franz Schubert&#x27;s Music&quot;==
&quot;Constructions of Subjectivity in Franz Schubert&#x27;s Music&quot; first appeared as a paper delivered at the American Musicological Society in 1990 and then in a revised version as a symposium presentation during the 1992 Schubertiade Festival in New York City. At the time McClary was influenced by Maynard Solomon&#x27;s claim in his 1989 paper &quot;Franz Schubert and the Peacocks of Benvenuto Cellini&quot; that Schubert was homosexual. McClary&#x27;s paper explored the relevance of Solomon&#x27;s research to what she termed the uninhibited, &quot;hedonistic&quot; luxuriance of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Unfinished&quot; Symphony.&quot; The symposium paper elicited some mild controversy. Following evidence that Solomon&#x27;s conclusions may have been flawed and largely based on his own psychoanalytic reading of a dream narrative Schubert set down in 1822, McClary revised the paper again. Its definitive version was printed in the 1994 edition of the book &quot;Queering the Pitch: The New Gay and Lesbian Musicology&quot; edited by Philip Brett, Elizabeth Wood, and Gary Thomas.

According to McClary, Schubert, in the second movement of his &quot;Unfinished Symphony,&quot; foregoes the usual narrative of the sonata form by &quot;wandering&quot; from one key area to another in a manner which does not consolidate the tonic, but without causing its violent reaffirmation:

What is remarkable about this movement is that Schubert conceives of and executes a musical narrative that does not enact the more standard model in which a self strives to define identity through the consolidation of ego boundaries...in a Beethovian world such a passage would sound vulnerable, its tonal identity not safely anchored; and its ambiguity would probably precipitate a crisis, thereby justifying the violence needed to put things right again.

While maintaining that attempting to read Schubert&#x27;s sexuality from his music would be essentialism, she proposes that it may be possible to notice intentional ways in which Schubert composed in order to express his &quot;difference&quot; as a part of himself at a time when &quot;the self&quot; was becoming prominent in the arts. Schubert&#x27;s music and often the man himself and the subjectivity he presented have been criticized as effeminate, especially in comparison to Beethoven, the model and aggressive master of the sonata form (Sir George Grove, after Schumann: &quot;compared with Beethoven, Schubert is as a woman to a man&quot;; Carl Dahlhaus: &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;involuntary&quot;). However, McClary notes: &quot;what is at issue is not Schubert&#x27;s deviance from a &quot;straight&quot; norm, but rather his particular constructions of subjectivity, especially as they contrast with many of those posed by his peers.&quot;

Some of the ideas about composition as subjective narrative proposed in &quot;Constructions&quot; were developed by McClary in her 1997 article, &quot;The Impromptu that trod on a loaf&quot;, which applies this analysis to Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Impromptu&quot; Op. 90, Number 2. &quot;Constructions of Subjectivity in Franz Schubert&#x27;s Music&quot; and the ideas in it continue to be discussed, sometimes critically. However, the article influenced a number of queer theorists, and in 2003 was described by the musicologist, Lawrence Kramer, as still an important paper in the field. The paper, and the reactions to it are also discussed in Mark Lindsey Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Virtuosi: A Defense and a (sometimes Erotic) Celebration of Great Pianists&quot;.

==Criticism==
In the January 1987 issue of &quot;Minnesota Composers Forum Newsletter&quot;, McClary wrote of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony:

The point of recapitulation in the first movement of the Ninth is one of the most horrifying moments in music, as the carefully prepared cadence is frustrated, damming up energy which finally explodes in the throttling murderous rage of a rapist incapable of attaining release.

This sentence elicited and continues to elicit a great range of responses. McClary subsequently rephrased this passage in &quot;Feminine Endings&quot;:

&#x27;[...] [T]he point of recapitulation in the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony unleashes one of the most horrifyingly violent episodes in the history of music. The problem Beethoven has constructed for this movement is that it seems to begin before the subject of the symphony has managed to achieve its identity. (128)

She goes on to conclude that &quot;The Ninth Symphony is probably our most compelling articulation in music of the contradictory impulses that have organized patriarchal culture since the Enlightenment&quot; (129). The critiques of McClary discussed below refer primarily to the original version of the passage. Several commentators have objected to McClary&#x27;s characterizations, including Robert Anton Wilson, Elaine Barkin, and Henry Kingsbury.

Music theorist Pieter van den Toorn has complained that McClary&#x27;s polemics negate the asocial autonomy of absolute music; he is concerned with formal analysis in the tradition of Schenker.. Van den Toorn complains, for example, that &quot;Fanned by an aversion for male sexuality, which it depicts as something brutal and contemptible, irrelevancies are being read into the music.&quot; Van den Toorn&#x27;s complaint was rebutted by musicologist Ruth Solie. Van den Toorn responded with a book on these issues. Musicologist Paula Higgins, in another critique of McClary&#x27;s work, has observed that &quot;one wonders ... if [McClary] has not strategically co-opted feminism as an excuse for guerrilla attacks on the field.&quot; Higgins complains of McClary&#x27;s &quot;truculent verbal assaults on musicological straw men&quot;, and observes that &quot;For all the hip culture critique imported from other fields, McClary has left the cobwebs of patriarchal musicological thought largely intact.&quot; Higgins is also critical of McClary&#x27;s citation practice as it concerns other scholars in the area of feminist musical criticism.

The pianist and critic Charles Rosen has also commented on the famous passage. He avoids taking offense on any of the grounds mentioned above, and is willing to admit sexual metaphors to musical analysis. Rosen&#x27;s disagreement is simply with McClary&#x27;s assessment of the music:

:We have first her characterization of the moment of recapitulation in the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony:

:The phrase about the murderous rage of the rapist has since been withdrawn [as noted above], which indicates that McClary realized it posed a problem, but it has the great merit of recognizing that something extraordinary is taking place here, and McClary&#x27;s metaphor of sexual violence is not a bad way to describe it. The difficulty is that all metaphors oversimplify, like those entertaining little stories that music critics in the nineteenth century used to invent about works of music for an audience whose musical literacy was not too well developed. I do not, myself, find the cadence frustrated or dammed up in any constricting sense, but only given a slightly deviant movement which briefly postpones total fulfillment.

:To continue the sexual imagery, I cannot think that the rapist incapable of attaining release is an adequate analogue, but I hear the passage as if Beethoven had found a way of making an orgasm last for sixteen bars. What causes the passage to be so shocking, indeed, is the power of sustaining over such a long phrase what we expect as a brief explosion. To McClary&#x27;s credit, it should be said that some kind of metaphorical description is called for, and even necessary, but I should like to suggest that none will be satisfactory or definitive.

McClary also notes that she &quot;can say something nice about Beethoven&quot;, saying of his String Quartet, Op. 132, &quot;Few pieces offer so as vivid an image of shattered subjectivity the opening of Op. 132.&quot;

Writing over thirty years after its publication, McClary observed:

People often ask me if I regret having written this essay. I have lived with the consequences for over thirty years, and no matter how much I publish on modal theory or Kaija Saariaho, I will always be identified with this sentence, nearly always taken out of context. I hasten to mention that I have taught a course on Beethoven quartets every other year since 1980; unless a student has googled me and asked about the controversy, no one in my classes would have any inkling of my presumed hatred of this composer. But no, &quot;je ne regrette rien&quot;. I still stand by my argument and even my imagery after all these years.

== Personal life ==
McClary is married to musicologist Robert Walser.

<doc id="382063" wikidata="Q561142" url="?curid=382063" title="Benjamin Zephaniah">
<text>Benjamin Obadiah Iqbal Zephaniah (; 15 April 1958 – 7 December 2023) was a British writer, dub poet, actor, musician and professor of poetry and creative writing. He was included in &quot;The Times&quot; list of Britain&#x27;s top 50 post-war writers in 2008. In his work, Zephaniah drew on his lived experiences of incarceration, racism and his Jamaican heritage. 

He won the BBC Radio 4 Young Playwrights Festival Award in 1998 and was the recipient of at least sixteen honorary doctorates. A ward at Ealing Hospital was also named in his honour. His second novel, &quot;Refugee Boy&quot;, was the recipient of the 2002 Portsmouth Book Award in the Longer Novel category. In 1982, he released an album, &quot;Rasta&quot;, which featured the Wailers performing for the first time since the death of Bob Marley, acting as a tribute to Nelson Mandela. It topped the charts in Yugoslavia, and due to its success Mandela invited Zephaniah to host the president&#x27;s Two Nations Concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in 1996. As an actor, he had a major role in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; between 2013 and 2022.

A vegan and animal rights activist, who called himself an anarchist, Zephaniah supported changing the British electoral system from first-past-the-post to alternative vote. In 2003, Zephaniah was offered appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) but publicly rejected the honour, stating that: &quot;I get angry when I hear that word &#x27;empire&#x27;; it reminds me of slavery, it reminds of thousands of years of brutality, it reminds me of how my foremothers were raped and my forefathers, brutalised&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Benjamin Obadiah Iqbal Springer was born on 15 April 1958, in the Handsworth district of Birmingham, England, where he was also raised. He referred to this area as the &quot;Jamaican capital of Europe&quot;. The son of parents who had migrated from the Caribbean – Oswald Springer, a Barbadian postman, and Leneve (née Honeyghan), a Jamaican nurse who came to Britain in 1956 and worked for the National Health Service – he had a total of seven younger siblings, including his twin sister, Velda. 

Zephaniah wrote that he was strongly influenced by the music and poetry of Jamaica and what he called &quot;street politics&quot;, and he said in a 2005 interview: His first performance was in church when he was 11 years old, resulting in him adopting the name Zephaniah (after the biblical prophet), and by the age of 15, his poetry was already known among Handsworth&#x27;s Afro-Caribbean and Asian communities.

He was educated at Broadway School, Birmingham, from which he was expelled aged 13, unable to read or write due to dyslexia. He was sent to Boreatton Park approved school in Baschurch, Shropshire.

The gift, during his childhood, of an old, manual typewriter inspired him to become a writer. It is now in the collection of Birmingham Museums Trust.

As a youth, he spent time in borstal and in his late teens received a criminal record and served a prison sentence for burglary. Tired of the limitations of being a black poet communicating with black people only, he decided to expand his audience, and in 1979, at the age of 22, he headed to London, where his first book would be published the next year.

While living in London, Zephaniah was assaulted during the 1981 Brixton riots and chronicled his experiences on his 1982 album &quot;Rasta&quot;. He experienced racism on a regular basis:

In a session with John Peel on 1 February 1983 – one of two Peel sessions he recorded that year – Zephaniah&#x27;s responses were recorded in such poems as &quot;Dis Policeman&quot;, &quot;The Boat&quot;, &quot;Riot in Progress&quot; and &quot;Uprising Downtown&quot;.

==Written work and poetry==

Having moved to London, Zephaniah became actively involved in a workers&#x27; co-operative in Stratford, which led to the publication of his first book of poetry, &quot;Pen Rhythm&quot; (Page One Books, 1980). He had earlier been turned down by other publishers who did not believe there would be an audience for his work, and &quot;they didn&#x27;t understand it because it was supposed to be performed&quot;. Three editions of &quot;Pen Rhythm&quot; were published. Zephaniah said that his mission was to fight the dead image of poetry in academia, and to &quot;take [it] everywhere&quot; to people who do not read books, so he turned poetry readings into concert-like performances, sometimes with The Benjamin Zephaniah Band.

His second collection of poetry, &quot;The Dread Affair: Collected Poems&quot; (1985), contained a number of poems attacking the British legal system. &quot;Rasta Time in Palestine&quot; (1990), an account of a visit to the Palestinian occupied territories, contained poetry and travelogue.

Zephaniah was poet-in-residence at the chambers of Michael Mansfield QC, and sat in on the inquiry into Bloody Sunday and other cases, these experiences led to his &quot;Too Black, Too Strong&quot; poetry collection (2001). &quot;We Are Britain!&quot; (2002) is a collection of poems celebrating cultural diversity in Britain.

He published several collections of poems, as well as novels, specifically for young people. &quot;Talking Turkeys&quot; (1994), his first poetry book for children, was reprinted after six weeks. In 1999, he wrote his first novel &quot;Face&quot; – a story of &quot;facial discrimination&quot;, as he described it – which was intended for teenagers, and sold some 66,000 copies. Poet Raymond Antrobus, who was given the novel when he had just started attending a deaf school, has written: &quot;I remember reading the whole thing in one go. I was very self-conscious about wearing hearing aids and I needed stories that humanised disability, as &quot;Face&quot; did. I was still struggling with my literacy at the time, and I understood Benjamin as someone who was self-taught and had been marginalised within the education system. And so he really felt like an ambassador for young people like me.&quot;

Zephaniah&#x27;s second novel &quot;Refugee Boy&quot;, about a 14-year-old refugee from Ethiopia and Eritrea, was published in August 2001. It was the recipient of the 2002 Portsmouth Book Award in the Longer Novel category, and went on to sell 88,000 copies. In 2013, &quot;Refugee Boy&quot; was adapted as a play by Zephaniah&#x27;s long-time friend Lemn Sissay, staged at the West Yorkshire Playhouse.

In May 2011, Zephaniah accepted a year-long position as poet-in-residence at Keats House in Hampstead, London, his first residency role for more than ten years. In accepting the role, he commented: &quot;I don&#x27;t do residencies, but Keats is different. He&#x27;s a one-off, and he has always been one of my favourite poets.&quot; The same year, he was appointed professor of poetry and creative writing at Brunel University London.

In 2016, Zephaniah wrote the foreword to &quot;Angry White People: Coming Face-to-Face with the British Far Right&quot; by Hsiao-Hung Pai.

Zephaniah&#x27;s frank autobiography, &quot;The Life and Rhymes of Benjamin Zephaniah&quot;, was published to coincide with his 60th birthday in 2018, when BBC Sounds broadcast him reading his own text. &quot;I&#x27;m still as angry as I was in my twenties,&quot; he said. The book was nominated as &quot;autobiography of the year&quot; at the National Book Awards.

The &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot; dubbed him &quot;The people&#x27;s laureate&quot;.

On the publication of his young adult novel &quot;Windrush Child&quot; in 2020, Zephaniah was outspoken about the importance of the way history is represented in the curriculum of schools.

==Acting and media appearances ==

Zephaniah made minor appearances in several television programmes in the 1980s and 1990s, including
&quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; (1988), &quot;EastEnders&quot; (1993), &quot;The Bill&quot; (1994), and &quot;Crucial Tales&quot; (1996). In 1990, he appeared in the film &quot;Farendj&quot;, directed by Sabine Prenczina and starring Tim Roth.

He was the &quot;castaway&quot; on the 8 June 1997 episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, where his chosen book was the &quot;Poetical Works of Shelley&quot;.

In 2005, BBC One broadcast a television documentary about his life, &quot;A Picture of Birmingham, by Benjamin Zephaniah&quot;, which was repeated by BBC Two on 7 December 2023.

In December 2012, he was guest editor of an episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Today&quot;, for which he commissioned a &quot;good news bulletin&quot;.

Between 2013 and 2022, Zephaniah played the role of preacher Jeremiah &quot;Jimmy&quot; Jesus in BBC television drama &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;, appearing in 14 episodes across the six series. 

In 2020, he appeared as a panellist on the BBC television comedy quiz show &quot;QI&quot;, on the episode &quot;Roaming&quot;.

==Music==
In 1982, Zephaniah released the album &quot;Rasta&quot;, which featured the Wailers&#x27; first recording since the death of Bob Marley as well as a tribute to the political prisoner (later to become South African president) Nelson Mandela. The album gained Zephaniah international prestige and topped the Yugoslavian pop charts. It was because of this recording that he was introduced to Mandela, and in 1996, Mandela requested that Zephaniah host the president&#x27;s Two Nations Concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London.

Zephaniah released a total of seven albums of original music.

==Views==
Zephaniah was connected with – and served as patron for – many organizations that aligned with his beliefs.

===Animal rights and veganism===
Zephaniah became a vegetarian at the age of 11, and then became a vegan at the age of 13, when he read poems about &quot;shimmering fish floating in an underwater paradise, and birds flying free in the clear blue sky&quot;.

He was an honorary patron of The Vegan Society, Viva!, and EVOLVE! Campaigns, and was an animal rights advocate. In 2004, he wrote the foreword to Keith Mann&#x27;s book &quot;From Dusk &#x27;til Dawn: An insider&#x27;s view of the growth of the Animal Liberation Movement&quot;, a book about the Animal Liberation Front. In August 2007, he announced that he would be launching the Animal Liberation Project, alongside People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. In February 2001, his book &quot;The Little Book of Vegan Poems&quot; was published by AK Press.

===Anti-racism activism===
Zephaniah spoke extensively about his personal experiences of anti-Black racism in Britain and incorporated his experiences in much of his written work.

In 2012, Zephaniah worked with anti-racism organisation Newham Monitoring Project, with whom he made a video, and Tower Hamlets Summer University (Futureversity) about the impact of Olympic policing on black communities. In that same year, he also wrote about cases of racially abusive language employed by police officers and &quot;the reality of police racism that many of us experience all the time&quot;.

In November 2003, Zephaniah was offered appointment in the 2004 New Year Honours as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), for which he said he had been recommended by Tony Blair. But he publicly rejected the honour and in a subsequent article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, elaborated on learning about being considered for the award and his reasons for rejecting it: &quot;Me? I thought, OBE me? Up yours, I thought. I get angry when I hear that word &#x27;empire&#x27;; it reminds me of slavery, it reminds of thousands of years of brutality, it reminds me of how my foremothers were raped and my forefathers brutalised... Benjamin Zephaniah OBE – no way Mr Blair, no way Mrs Queen. I am profoundly anti-empire.&quot;

=== Other activism ===
Zephaniah spoke in favour of a British Republic and the dis-establishment of the Crown. In 2015, he called for Welsh and Cornish to be taught in English schools, saying: &quot;Hindi, Chinese and French are taught [in schools], so why not Welsh? And why not Cornish? They&#x27;re part of our culture.&quot;

Zephaniah supported Amnesty International in 2005, speaking out against homophobia in Jamaica, saying: &quot;For many years Jamaica was associated with freedom fighters and liberators, so it hurts when I see that the home of my parents is now associated with the persecution of people because of their sexual orientation.&quot;

In 2016, Zephaniah curated &quot;We Are All Human&quot;, an exhibition at London&#x27;s Southbank Centre presented by the Koestler Trust, which exhibited art works by prisoners, detainees and ex-offenders.

Zephaniah was a supporter of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and joined demonstrations calling for an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, describing the activism as the &quot;Anti Apartheid movement&quot;. He was also a supporter of the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement.

===Political views===
Zephaniah self-identified as an anarchist; observing in a 2022 interview: &quot;...there are places that live without government and live peacefully and happily. A lack of power means people of course aren&#x27;t fighting over it and the main objective of society is to look after each other.&quot; He appeared in literature to support changing the British electoral system from first-past-the-post to alternative vote for electing members of parliament to the House of Commons in the Alternative Vote referendum in 2011. In a 2017 interview, commenting on the ongoing Brexit negotiations, Zephaniah stated: &quot;For left-wing reasons, I think we should leave the EU but the way that we&#x27;re leaving is completely wrong.&quot;

In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated: &quot;Labour&#x27;s election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.&quot;

==Achievements and recognition==
In 1998, Zephaniah was a winner of the BBC Young Playwrights Festival Award with his first ever radio play &quot;Hurricane Dub&quot;.

In 1999, he was the subject of an illustrated biographical children&#x27;s book by Verna Wilkins, entitled &quot;Benjamin Zephaniah: A Profile&quot;, published in the Black Stars Series of Tamarind Books. 

Zephaniah was awarded at least 16 honorary doctorates, by institutions including the University of North London (in 1998), the University of Central England (1999), Staffordshire University (2001), London South Bank University (2003), the University of Exeter, the Open University (2004), the University of Westminster (2006), the University of Birmingham (2008) and the University of Hull (DLitt, 2010).

In 2008, he was listed at 48 in &quot;The Times&quot; list of 50 greatest post-war writers. A ward at Ealing Hospital was named in his honour.

He was awarded Best Original Song in the Hancocks 2008, Talkawhile Awards for Folk Music (as voted by members of Talkawhile.co.uk) for &quot;Tam Lyn Retold&quot;, recorded with The Imagined Village project on their eponymous 2007 album. He collected the award at The Cambridge Folk Festival on 2 August 2008, describing himself as a &quot;Rasta Folkie&quot;.

To mark National Poetry Day in 2009, the BBC ran an online poll to find the nation&#x27;s favourite poet, with Zephaniah taking third place in the public vote, behind T. S. Eliot and John Donne, and being the only living poet to be named in the top 10.

Zephaniah&#x27;s 2020 reality television series &quot;Life &amp; Rhymes&quot;, on Sky Arts, celebrating spoken-word performances, won a British Academy Television Award (BAFTA), the Lew Grade Award for Best Entertainment Programme, in 2021.

==Personal life==
Zephaniah lived for many years in east London; however, in 2008, he began dividing his time between a village near Spalding, Lincolnshire, and Beijing in China. He was a keen language learner and studied Mandarin Chinese for more than a decade.

Zephaniah was married for 12 years to Amina, a theatre administrator. His infertility – which he discussed openly – meant that they could not have children and his criminal record prevented them from adopting. They divorced in 2001. 

In 2017, Zephaniah married Qian Zheng, whom he had met on a visit to China three years earlier, and who survives him.

In May 2018, in an interview of BBC Radio 5 Live, Zephaniah admitted that he had been violent to a former partner, confessing to having hit her. He said:

His cousin, Michael Powell, died in police custody, at Thornhill Road police station in Birmingham, in September 2003 and Zephaniah regularly raised the matter, continuously campaigning with his brother Tippa Naphtali, who set up a national memorial fund in Powell&#x27;s name to help families affected by deaths in similar circumstances.

Zephaniah&#x27;s family were Christian but he became a Rastafarian at a young age. He gave up smoking cannabis in his thirties.

He was a supporter of Aston Villa F.C. – having been taken to matches as a boy, by an uncle – and was the patron for an Aston Villa supporters&#x27; website, as well as an ambassador for the club&#x27;s charity, the Aston Villa Foundation. 

===Death and legacy===
Zephaniah died on 7 December 2023, at the age of 65, after being diagnosed with a brain tumour eight weeks previously. His friend of nearly twenty years, Joan Armatrading, gave a tribute to him on &quot;Newsnight&quot; on BBC Two after hearing the news of his death. Writing on Twitter, she said: &quot;I am in shock. Benjamin Zephaniah has died age 65. What a thoughtful, kind and caring man he was. The world has lost a poet, an intellectual and a cultural revolutionary. I have lost a great friend.&quot;

The BBC later re-broadcast Zephaniah&#x27;s documentary &quot;A Picture of Birmingham&quot;, in which he revisited his birthplace and his former approved school. Fiona Bruce, the presenter of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot;, on which Zephaniah was a regular panellist, paid tribute to him, saying: &quot;He was an all round, just tremendous bloke&quot; for whom she had &quot;huge affection and respect&quot;.

According to Martin Glynn of Birmingham City University, Zephaniah was &quot;never an establishment person&quot;, but &quot;got into spaces&quot; where he felt he could be heard. Glynn said: &quot;He was the James Brown of dub poetry, the godfather... Linton Kwesi Johnson spoke to the political classes, but Benjamin was a humanist, he made poetry popular and loved music. He had his own studio... He did what John Cooper Clarke did with poetry and that was bringing it into the mainstream.&quot;

The family issued a statement on 7 December regarding Benjamin Zephaniah&#x27;s death, saying: &quot;Thank you for the love you have shown Professor Benjamin Zephaniah.&quot; The Benjamin Zephaniah Family Legacy website was launched in March 2024.

Aston Villa Football Club paid tribute to Zephaniah on Saturday, 9 December 2023, in advance of their home match against Arsenal F.C., by playing on the big screens his ode to Villa, originally recorded in 2015.

His private funeral, attended by close friends and family, took place on 28 December, and it was requested that well-wishers plant flowers, trees or plants in Zephaniah’s honour, rather than sending cut flowers.

An artwork featuring Zephaniah that appeared on the wall of an underpass in Hockley, Birmingham, in March 2024 was accidentally painted over by a council sub-contractor employed to remove graffiti, although Zephaniah&#x27;s family had been given assurances that the mural would be protected. Following a public backlash, an apology was issued, and new artwork was subsequently commissioned from black artists, to be unveiled on 14 April at Handsworth Park.

As a tribute, in April 2024, BBC Radio 4 broadcast the 2018 &quot;Book of the Week&quot; recording of Zephaniah reading his autobiography, &quot;The Life and Rhymes of Benjamin Zephaniah&quot;.

In September 2024, an outdoor space at Brunel University of London was named after Zephaniah.

<text>Dalkeith ( ; , ) is a town in Midlothian, Scotland, on the River Esk. It was granted a burgh of barony in 1401 and a burgh of regality in 1540. The settlement of Dalkeith grew southwestwards from its 12th-century castle (now Dalkeith Palace).
Dalkeith has a population of 12,342 people according to the 2011 census.

The town is divided into four distinct areas: Dalkeith proper with its town centre and historic core; Eskbank (considered to be the well-heeled neighbourhood of Dalkeith with many large Victorian and newer houses) to its west; Woodburn (primarily a working class council estate with pockets of new housing developments) to its east; and Newbattle (a semi-rural village with its abbey) to the south.

Dalkeith is the main administrative centre for Midlothian. It is twinned with Jarnac, France. In 2004, Midlothian Council re-paved Jarnac Court in honour of Dalkeith and Jarnac&#x27;s long standing link.

On the north-eastern edge of Dalkeith at Woodburn is the Dalkeith Campus (completed 2003) – housing both Dalkeith High School and St David&#x27;s Roman Catholic High School plus community leisure facilities.

==Etymology==
&quot;Dalkeith&quot; is understood to be a Cumbric name, cognate with Welsh &quot;ddôl&quot; &#x27;meadow, plateau, valley&#x27; + &quot;coed&quot; &#x27;wood&#x27;.

== Prehistory and archaeology ==
During the construction of the Dalkeith Northern Bypass in 1994-95 and 2006-08 (final construction was delayed for over a decade) archaeologists, working for CFA Archaeology, uncovered many archaeological features and information on the prehistory and history of the area. Their findings included two ring-groove structures, two pit alignments, a Roman temporary camp, a post-medieval building, an 18th-century designed landscape, and two industrial sites with a brick and tile works and a coal pit engine house. Given the wide area covered they were able to surmise the general settlement patterns of Dalkeith over the centuries. Settlement and land use was concentrated on the sands and gravels of the river terraces and only a bit of human occupation on the compacted clays that are found throughout the area. They also determined that people had been living in the Dalkeith area since the Neolithic. 

==History==

One of the earliest historical references to Dalkeith is found in the Chronicles of Jean Froissart, who stayed at Dalkeith Castle for fifteen days. He writes of the Battle of Otterburn and the death of James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas: &quot;I, author of this book, in my youth had ridden nigh over all the realm of Scotland, and I was then fifteen days in the house of earl William Douglas, father to the same earl James, of whom I spake of now, in a castle of five leagues from Edinburgh which is called in the country Dalkeith. The same time I saw there this earl James, a fair young child, and a sister of his called the lady Blanche.&quot;

In 1650, Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s army came to Dalkeith. His officer General George Monck was Commander in Scotland, and the government of the country was based out of Dalkeith Castle.

In 1831, Dalkeith was linked to Edinburgh by the Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway, which transported coal, minerals, and agricultural produce. Two decades later, in 1853, a Corn Exchange, at the time the largest indoor grain market in Scotland, was built.

In 1879, Dalkeith was where William Ewart Gladstone started his campaign for British Prime Minister, which became known as the &quot;Midlothian campaign&quot;.

==Notable buildings==

The Collegiate Church of St Nicholas Buccleuch, formerly known as Dalkeith Parish Church, stands on High Street. Dedicated to St Nicholas, this medieval church became a collegiate establishment in 1406, founded by Sir James Douglas. The nave and transepts date from 1854, when the inside of the church was greatly altered. The chancel was abandoned in 1590, walled off from the rest of the church, and is now ruinous. Sir James Douglas, 1st Earl of Morton, and his wife Joanna, daughter of James I, are buried in the choir and have stone effigies. St Nicholas Buccleuch Church remains one of the two Church of Scotland parish churches in Dalkeith, the other being St John&#x27;s and King&#x27;s Park Church. The Episcopal Church, St Mary&#x27;s is on High Street, at the entrance to Dalkeith Country Park. St David&#x27;s Church, on Eskbank Road, is the only Roman Catholic church in the town, it is a category A listed building and was built in 1854.

Dalkeith Palace which replaced the castle in the late 16th century and was rebuilt in the early 18th century, lies at the north-east edge of the town. It is a former seat of the Duke of Buccleuch, surrounded by parkland and follies.

The building on High Street now known as Dalkeith Tolbooth dates from 1648 although it was reconstructed in the early 18th century. It incorporated prison cells in the basement, a weigh house on the ground floor and a courtroom on the first floor. In front of the building there is a circle of stones to mark the spot where the last public hanging in Dalkeith took place. William Thomson was hanged here for highway robbery in 1827. The Municipal Buildings in Buccleuch Street were completed in 1882.

Other notable buildings include a Watch Tower at the cemetery (1827), a water tower and early 19th-century iron mills and the Masonic Temple or Lodge Rooms of the Dalkeith Kilwinning Masonic Lodge No.10 situated next to The Collegiate Church of St Nicholas Buccleuch in the high street completed in 1766. 

Edinburgh College has its Midlothian Campus in Eskbank, close to the railway station.

There is a modern Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormon) meeting house on Newbattle Road.

Midlothian Community Hospital is just outside Dalkeith, located off the A7 road on the eastern edge of the neighbouring town of Bonnyrigg.

==Transport==
Until 2008, Dalkeith was on the A68, one of the main routes south from Edinburgh to Jedburgh and across the border to Darlington. A bypass to take traffic away from the town centre was completed in September 2008; this then took the A68 number, and the old route of the A68 is now the A6106.

Other main roads serving Dalkeith are:

#A6094 — leads SW towards Bonnyrigg and Peebles, and NE towards Musselburgh
#A768 — leads west from Eskbank to Lasswade and Loanhead
#B6373 — a road wholly within Dalkeith, leaving and rejoining the A6106
#B6414 – leaves the A6094 on the NE edge of Dalkeith (at Woodburn) and leads NE to Tranent
#B6392 – runs north–south through Eskbank, and used to be the route of the A7 which leads from Edinburgh to Galashiels and Hawick
#B703 – leads south from Eskbank, through Newbattle, to Newtongrange
#B6482 – leaves the A6106 on the SE edge of Dalkeith (at Woodburn) and leads into Easthouses and Mayfield.

The re-building of the northern section of the Waverley Railway Line re-connected Dalkeith to the national rail network after a gap of more than 40 years, with a station at Eskbank on the western edge of Dalkeith. Construction commenced in late 2012, and the line re-opened to passenger services on 6 September 2015.

Bus services in Dalkeith are mostly run by Lothian Buses; East Coast Buses and Borders Buses also serve the town.

For walkers, the Penicuik–Dalkeith Walkway passes close by.

===Rugby===
Dalkeith RFC play in the Scottish Rugby Union East Leagues. The club was the first in Midlothian to open full membership to women and the first in the county to run a women&#x27;s side. Notable former players include Sir David Murray, whose car crash on the way back from a match in North Berwick ended his rugby career and led to him focusing on his business empire. Adam Robson, who went on to become President of the Scottish Rugby Union, also played for the club.

<text>Dingwall (, ) is a town and a royal burgh in the Highland council area of Scotland. It has a population of 5,491. It was an east-coast harbour that now lies inland. 

Dingwall Castle was once the biggest castle north of Stirling. On the town&#x27;s present-day outskirts lies Tulloch Castle, parts of which may date back to the 12th century. In 1411 the Battle of Dingwall is said to have taken place between the Clan Mackay and the Clan Donald.

==History==
===Early history===

Its name, derived from the Scandinavian (field or meeting-place of the &quot;thing&quot;, or local assembly; compare Tynwald, Tingwall, Thingwall in the British Isles alone, plus many others across northern Europe), preserves the Viking connections of the town; Gaels call it (), meaning &quot;the mouth of the Peffery&quot; or meaning &quot;cabbage town&quot;.

The site of the , and of the medieval Moothill, thought to have been established by the Vikings after they invaded in the 8th century, lies beneath the Cromartie memorial.

===Early middle ages===

In the early Middle Ages Dingwall Castle, which was established in the 11th century, was reputed to have the largest castle north of Stirling. King Alexander II created Dingwall a royal burgh in 1226, the burgh becoming the seat of the Earls of Ross. James IV renewed its royal burgh charter in 1497. On the top of Knockfarrel (), a hill about to the west, stands a large and very complete vitrified fort with ramparts.

An obelisk, high, was erected over the grave of George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie, near the parish church of St Clement after he died in 1717. It was affected by subsidence, becoming known as the &quot;Leaning Tower&quot;, and was later replaced by a much smaller replica. Dingwall Town Hall, which dates back to 1745, still survives. 

The Ferry Road drill hall was completed in 1910. Dingwall formerly served as the county town of Ross and Cromarty: the headquarters of Ross and Cromarty County Council, established in 1889, was County Buildings in Dingwall.

James Gillanders of Highfield Cottage near Dingwall, was the Factor for the estate of Major Charles Robertson of Kincardine and, as his employer was then serving with the British Army in Australia, Gillanders was the person most responsible for the mass evictions staged at Glencalvie, Ross-shire in 1845. A Gaelic-language poem denouncing Gillanders for the brutality of the evictions was later submitted anonymously to Pàdraig MacNeacail, the editor of the Canadian Gaelic column in which the poem was later published in the Nova Scotia newspaper &quot;The Casket&quot;. The poem, which is believed either to be or to draw upon eyewitness accounts, is believed to be the only Gaelic language source of information relating to the evictions in Glencalvie.

===Recent history===

The town has a pedestrian Heritage Trail, which launched in March 2023, with information boards at key historical sites around the town.

As a result of storms in late October 2006, Dingwall was subject to widespread flooding the aftermath of which left the town and much of the Highlands north of Inverness, including the A9 and Far North Line, cut off for a time In August 2019 the town was once again flooded.

Dingwall&#x27;s Post Office was named the UK&#x27;s most improved delivery office of the year in Royal Mail&#x27;s 2021 Awards.

==Geography and transport==

Dingwall lies near the head of the Cromarty Firth where the valley of the Peffery unites with the alluvial lands at the mouth of the Conon, northwest of Inverness. The town contains a particularly short canal, the Dingwall Canal, also known locally as the River Peffery. Dingwall railway station has been on what is now called the Far North Line since about 1865. It also serves the Kyle of Lochalsh Line.

Dingwall is on the former main road route to the north Highlands (A9). Since the completion of the Cromarty Bridge in 1979, the main road has bypassed Dingwall. Heading west, the A834 joins the A835 road which is the main route to the north west Highlands, including Ullapool.

==Sport and media==
Dingwall is the home of football team Ross County, who won promotion to the Scottish Premier League in 2012 and finished the 2012/13 season in fifth place. Despite the town&#x27;s small population, Ross County attract sizeable crowds to Victoria Park from across the whole surrounding area. The team reached the 2010 Scottish Cup Final, having knocked out Celtic in the previous round. Ross County won their first piece of major silverware in 2016, winning the Scottish League Cup by beating Hibernian 2–1 in the final.

Television signals are received from the Rosemarkie TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated in Fodderty. 

Radio stations are provided by BBC Radio Scotland on 94.0 FM and BBC Radio nan Gàidheal (for Gaelic listeners) on 104.9 FM, MFR Radio on 96.7 FM and Highland FM on 107.1 FM which is an all-volunteer based community radio station. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Ross-shire Journal&quot;. 

== Education ==
Dingwall has a primary school, Dingwall Primary, serving the town.

Dingwall Academy is the secondary school serving the town and the wider area, including communities such as Strathpeffer, Contin, Conon Bridge, Maryburgh and Muir of Ord.

The Highland Theological College is located within the town, housed in a former Scottish Hydro Electric office. It is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands. Its focus is upon Theological Education, and is an accredited university for training Church of Scotland and United Free Church ministers and workers.

==Parliamentary Burgh==
Dingwall was a parliamentary burgh, combined with Dornoch, Kirkwall, Tain and Wick in the Northern Burghs constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918. Cromarty was added to the list in 1832. The constituency was a district of burghs known also as Tain Burghs until 1832, and then as Wick Burghs. 

It was represented by one Member of Parliament (MP). In 1918 the constituency was abolished and the Dingwall component was merged into the county constituency of Ross and Cromarty which was itself abolished in 1983.

<text>Dufftown ( ) is a burgh in Moray, Scotland. While the town is part of the historic Mortlach parish, the town was established and laid out in the early 19th century as part of a planned new town settlement. The town has several listed 19th century buildings and serves as a regional centre for agriculture, tourism and services. The town is well known for its whisky based economy, as it produces more whisky than any other town in Scotland and is home to several existing and former distilleries.

==History==
Historically part of Banffshire, Dufftown is in the ancient parish of Mortlach (). There is evidence of Pictish settlement in the area and in approximately 566 AD, St. Moluag established the first Christian church in the area, the site of the present Mortlach Parish Church. In the Middle Ages, Mortlach (in Latin &quot;Murthlacum&quot;) was an episcopal see. The Diocese of Mortlach was one of Scotland&#x27;s 13 medieval bishoprics. The names of four bishops of the see are known: Beóán of Mortlach (fl. 1012), &quot;Donercius&quot;, &quot;Cormauch&quot;, and Nechtan, who transferred the see to Aberdeen in April 1132, during the reign of King David I of Scotland. 

Balvenie Castle dates from the 13th century and is the second oldest building in the area, having been restored by John Comyn, Earl of Buchan and existing in use until 1746 when it was abandoned following the Jacobite Rebellion. Another building of historical significance is the primarily 15th century Castle of Auchindoun, which towers within the earthworks of an earlier prehistoric hill fort.

 While there was an earlier hamlet at Laichie and Mortlach, Dufftown as a Burgh was founded in 1817 by James Duff, 4th Earl Fife and was named after him. The town was established to help develop the Earls estate and provide both housing and employment for soldiers returning home from the Napoleonic War. The new town included the historic Mortlach settlement. The town was planned in the form of a right-angled cross or grid, with the streets running north, south, east and west from a square in the middle. This was in a similar format to other earlier Highland new town settlements such as nearby Grantown-on-Spey and Tomintoul. Properties were allocated on a Feu basis, with farming strips running away from each property, the first feu was number 3 Balvenie St.

By 1841, the town had grown to a population of 770 and the Clock Tower was built for use as a gaol and as the Burgh chambers between 1839 and 1847. A public hall was built in 1879 and this became a picture house (cinema) in the 20th century in the 1930s, before closing in the 1970s (the building survives as a restaurant). In 1890, Stephens cottage hospital was founded with funds from Lord Stephen and in 1902, a new public school was built for the town. The town continued to grow into the 19th century, reaching 1,823 people by 1901. However, by 1952, the population of Dufftown had decreased to 1,460.

==Geography==
Dufftown lies in the centre of a long glen (valley) amid the surrounding hills, which include the granite mountain of Ben Rinnes () to the southeast. The River Fiddich () is a right bank tributary of the River Spey that runs through the glen, giving its name to the whisky Glenfiddich. The Fiddich is joined on the eastern edge of the town by the Dullan Water which drains Glen Rinnes.

The geological composition beneath most of Dufftown is that of metamorphosed Dalradian sedimentary rocks with subsidiary volcanic rocks.

The Isla Way is a walking path that links Dufftown and the surrounding area with Keith.

===Climate===
Dufftown has an oceanic climate typical of Northern Scotland, characterised by relatively mild, damp winters and cool cloudy summers. The area averages 76 air frosts a year. Like much of Europe, Dufftown&#x27;s climate is insulated somewhat by the Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current originating near the Gulf of Mexico. This warm ocean current makes Dufftown&#x27;s climate significantly milder during the winter than expected for its latitude.

==Whisky in Dufftown==

Dufftown is located on the River Fiddich and is the location of several Scotch whisky distilleries. It produces more malt whisky than any other town in Scotland and lays claim to the assertion that it is the “Whisky Capital of the World”, as the term is widely found in news and tourism media and can also be found on signposts on the way into the town. Accordingly, there is a popular rhyme that goes &quot;‘Rome was built on seven hills, Dufftown stands on seven stills.’&quot;

The largest and best known of the many surrounding distilleries is the Glenfiddich distillery that distills Glenfiddich single malt Scotch whisky. The Glenfiddich distillery is owned by William Grant &amp; Sons, Dufftown&#x27;s largest employer. This proliferation puts it on the famed Malt Whisky Trail, which also includes Keith, Glen Grant Distillery, Marypark, and Tomintoul.

The town has a small whisky history museum and heritage centre, which is currently undergoing restoration, as the museum extends into a neighbouring property.
The following distilleries have produced whisky in Dufftown:

===Active distilleries===
* Balvenie
* Dufftown
* Glendullan
* Glenfiddich
* Kininvie
* Mortlach

===Former distilleries===
* Convalmore
* Parkmore
* Pittyvaich

==Culture and Community==

Dufftown hosts a highland games event every July which attracts many tourists.

The town acts as the epicentre for an annual whisky festival called &quot;The Spirit of Speyside&quot;.

In April 2021, a new regeneration project for the town entitled &quot;Destination Dufftown&quot; was launched. In response to recent economic decline in the town, the project aims to encourage new visitors to the town through a plan for new facilities for the town including a leisure centre, new accommodation for visitors, camping facilities and new shops.

===Community facilities===

The Stephen Hospital is a local community hospital serving the town under the responsibility of NHS Grampian. The hospital has 20 beds, was built in 1890 and extended in 1976 and 1984, including the addition of a local health centre.

Dufftown library is a small community library on Balvenie Street in the town. The library was scheduled for closure in 2013 but the council decided to keep the library open following a legal challenge from the public.

Tininver Park is a local community park in Dufftown with a play area that was upgraded in 2021.

Dufftown Golf Club is an 18 hole course located on the south-western edge of the town.

===Popular culture===

According to the third film in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, Hogwarts, the main setting of the series, is said to be close to Dufftown by Hermione Granger, when the town is mentioned in an article in &quot;The Daily Prophet&quot;.

==Landmarks==
Dufftown&#x27;s notable buildings include Balvenie Castle, which was partly built with stones from the ruins of nearby Auchindoun Castle. The street plan of Dufftown is mainly four main roads meeting at the Dufftown Clock Tower. Built in 1839, the Clock Tower is in square form, with three floors and a crenulated roof. It was previously used as a prison but is now a tourist information centre.

The town contains many Victorian era buildings, some of which are Category B and C listed in status. As well as the Clock Tower, notable examples include the former Clydesdale Bank at Number 1 Balvenie Street (built 1880), a three bay house at 49 Fife Street (built 1830–40), the Police Station and House on York Road (built 1897), the B-listed Maravale House at 68 Fife Street (mid 19th century) and 51 Fife Street (an early 19th century house with walls and gatepiers).

The Dufftown War Memorial to persons killed in the First World War and Second World War is located on Balvenie Street. The memorial is in the form of a bronze gothic cross on a granite-ashlar pillar and there is a garden of remembrance adjacent to the memorial.

==Transport==
The railway reached Dufftown in 1862 when the Keith and Dufftown Railway opened a station in the settlement. The station closed to passengers in 1968 with goods traffic coming to an end around 1991. In 2003, the Keith and Dufftown Railway Association reopened the station and the line as a preserved railway and set up their headquarters at the station. The nearest station with mainline services is Keith railway station.

The primary road through the town is the A941 (the north/south portion is locally named Balvenie St and the east portion is named Fife Street). The A941 bisects the town and meets the B9009 at the clock tower junction, where another road, Church St heads to Mortlach Parish Church.

==Education==

Mortlach Primary School provides education to primary school age children in the town. The school was built in 1902 and was originally the parish school serving Mortlach.

Dufftown does not have its own secondary school, the nearest is Speyside High School in Aberlour. 

==Religion==
The old Kirkton of Mortlach, with the historic Mortlach Parish Church, is on the southern outskirts of the present town. 

Today, the Diocese of Mortlach, under its Latin name of Murthlacum, is a titular see of the Catholic Church. A Catholic Church, St Mary’s, was built in the town in 1824 by the priest and musician George Gordon on Fife Street.

<doc id="382068" wikidata="Q421794" url="?curid=382068" title="The Darkness (band)">
<text>The Darkness are an English hard rock band formed in Lowestoft in 2000. The band consists of Justin Hawkins (vocals, guitar), his brother Dan Hawkins (guitar), Frankie Poullain (bass) and Rufus Tiger Taylor (drums).

The Darkness came to prominence with the release of their debut album, &quot;Permission to Land&quot;, in 2003. Backed by the singles &quot;I Believe in a Thing Called Love&quot;, &quot;Growing on Me&quot;, &quot;Get Your Hands off My Woman&quot;, and &quot;Love Is Only a Feeling&quot;, the album was certified quadruple platinum in the United Kingdom, with sales of over 1.3 million. In 2004 the band won three Brit Awards: Best British Group, Best British Rock Act, and Best British Album. After extensive touring in support of their debut album, Poullain left the band in 2005, and was replaced by former guitar technician Richie Edwards. The band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back&quot;, was released in November 2005. The following year, Justin Hawkins departed from the band after successfully completing a course of rehabilitation from alcohol and cocaine abuse. This, combined with the poor sales of the album, resulted in Atlantic dropping the band in October 2006. After the split, the remaining members formed Stone Gods, and continued to perform and record without Hawkins, who subsequently fronted his own project, Hot Leg.

In March 2011, the Darkness announced reunion shows, with original bassist Frankie Poullain, including Download Festival 2011, and the Isle of Wight Festival 2012. Their third album, &quot;Hot Cakes&quot;, was released in August 2012. Original drummer Ed Graham then left the band. A fourth studio album, &quot;Last of Our Kind&quot;, was released in 2015. A fifth album, &quot;Pinewood Smile&quot;, was released in 2017, followed by a live album, &quot;Live at Hammersmith&quot;, in 2018. Their sixth studio album, &quot;Easter Is Cancelled&quot;, was released in 2019. After the COVID-19 pandemic put a stop to their world tour in 2020, the band ended the year with a one-off streamed live show titled &quot;Streaming of a White Christmas&quot;, which was also recorded as a new live album. Their seventh studio album, &quot;Motorheart&quot;, was released in 2021, followed by an extensive UK tour through November and December.

==History==
===Early years===
Justin and Dan Hawkins played together as teenagers in a band which, according to Dan Hawkins, &quot;did a lot of Marillion covers, Bruce Springsteen, Genesis&quot; and were &quot;a bit prog-y&quot;. Justin Hawkins had been initially inspired to play guitar by Brian May of Queen, as he loved his tone and vibrato.

Originally known as Empire, the band generated some music industry buzz through their manager Sue Whitehouse, who was based at Savage &amp; Best in Camden. Whitehouse had managed them since Justin Hawkins&#x27; time as a creator of music jingles.

Renamed the Darkness they became renowned for their live show, and such was the popularity of the band, they had a Carling Homecoming gig booked for the London Astoria before they had even signed a record deal.

Joe Taylor, Aled Jones and Paul Scaife at The Tip Sheet first heard about the band through a post on The Tip Sheet message board, and featured &quot;Love Is Only a Feeling&quot; in January 2002. They started Record of the Day, and featured the song again around the time of SXSW in March 2003. They wanted to feature Friday Night too but they were told the band was saving it for an album.

According to A&amp;R Nick Raphael in an interview with HitQuarters, there was no initial clamour to sign the band, &quot;There couldn&#x27;t have been less of a buzz, and only two record labels showed any interest in them.&quot; He believes the reason for lack of interest was that &quot;The business as a whole thought they were uncool. In fact, people were saying that they were a joke and that they weren&#x27;t real.&quot; Raphael continued: &quot;Now, 3.5 million records later, they&#x27;re one of the greatest of all bands in the world, and that&#x27;s because what they did was real; they weren&#x27;t copying anyone. If they were copying, then they were copying someone from twenty years ago, and no-one else was doing that.&quot; 

Throughout their career, critics around the world would label them as a &quot;joke band&quot;. As part of Sony Music UK, Raphael had attempted to sign them, but the band instead opted to go with Atlantic Records. The band were hired to open for Disturbed on 1 December 2002 at Brixton Academy in which Justin Hawkins recalled numerous fans of Disturbed who threw bottles, shoes, and trash out of disgust at their stark contrast of Disturbed&#x27;s music. Singer David Draiman later attacked the band for their handling of the ordeal, with Hawkins recounting the issue on his youtube channel in 2022. Draiman later apologised for the incident, and to Hawkins following the video.

===&quot;Permission to Land&quot; and commercial success (2003–2005)===
Their debut album, &quot;Permission to Land&quot;, went straight up to number two in the UK charts upon its release on 7 July 2003, before going to number one and staying there for four weeks, eventually going on to sell 1.5 million copies in the UK.
The Darkness took inspiration for some of their work from the local north Suffolk area, including &quot;Black Shuck&quot; which mentions the nearby village of Blythburgh.

The success of the album led to heavy touring for the band over the next two years, including European portions of Metallica&#x27;s Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003. The band would later be added to the 2004 Big Day Out festival tour, performing alongside Metallica, Muse, The Strokes, Lostprophets, The Mars Volta, and The Black Eyed Peas. They then went on to headline the Carling Festival in 2004. The band won three BRIT Awards in 2004 in response to the album, &quot;Best Group&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Group&quot; and &quot;Best Album&quot;. They also won two Kerrang! awards in 2004 for &quot;Best Live Act&quot; and &quot;Best British Band&quot;. The third single from the album, &quot;I Believe in a Thing Called Love&quot;, was a smash hit in the UK and the United states, becoming the second highest charting single of 2003 released by a UK band in America. The band also managed a Christmas 2003 number 1, &quot;Christmas Time (Don&#x27;t Let the Bells End)&quot;, which only just fell short, both singles reaching number 2 in 2003.

===&quot;One Way Ticket to Hell... And Back&quot; and decline (2005–2006)===
In October 2005, a month before the album was to be officially released, Justin Hawkins won an eBay auction for a copy of &quot;One Way Ticket to Hell ...and Back&quot; for £350 under the username &#x27;turbogunhawk&#x27;. He claimed he did this so that he could track down whoever sold the digitally-marked advance copy of the album and try to prevent it from happening again.

&quot;One Way Ticket&quot;, the first single from their second album, was released on 14 November 2005, debuting and peaking at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart. The album itself was released on 28 November 2005 to mixed reviews. The album was produced by rock producer Roy Thomas Baker, best known for his work with Queen. Early sales figures in the UK showed the album had not sold as well as its predecessor, &quot;Permission to Land&quot;. The album debuted at number 11, and fell to number 34 in the second week of its release. Although it has since reached platinum status, this contrasts with their debut&#x27;s five-time platinum status.

The second single taken from their second album was &quot;Is It Just Me?&quot;, released on 20 February 2006. The single gained a preliminary position of No. 6 all that week, but finally charted at number 8. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, was Released 22 May and charted at number 39.

===Justin Hawkins&#x27; departure and break-up (2006)===

In August 2006, lead singer Justin Hawkins was admitted to a rehabilitation clinic in concern of his health, which caused the band to cancel several concerts. Around this same time the band confirmed that they were to start working on their third album to be released early 2007. Tabloid rumours held that Justin Hawkins was leaving the band after completing his course of rehabilitation from alcohol and cocaine problems, and the band would continue without him, possibly with Richie Edwards as the front man. In response to the story being reported by the media, the Darkness confirmed on their official forum: &quot;We&#x27;re sorry that you had to find this out through the newspapers, but we were hoping until the last minute that this – Justin&#x27;s exit – wasn&#x27;t going to happen. We – Dan, Ed and Richie – are still in total shock and can&#x27;t say at this stage what the future holds. We would like to thank all our fans, partners and family for their continuous support. You will hear from us, once we know what we want to do...&quot;

Hawkins departure, and the lacklustre sales of &quot;One Way Ticket to Hell...&quot; (which had only gone gold compared to the previous album&#x27;s four-times platinum status), led to Atlantic dropping the band from the label.

Using the pseudonym British Whale, Hawkins went on to release a cover version of the Sparks song &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot;, reaching No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart. In 2007, he launched a failed attempt to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest.

In 2011, Hawkins gave a different explanation for his departure from the band, saying he had left because he felt the band had stopped being creative.

===Other projects (2006–2011)===

On 9 November 2007, it was announced on The University of East Anglia&#x27;s student union website that a new band had been created comprising Dan Hawkins (lead guitar), Toby MacFarlaine (bass), Ed Graham (drums) and Ritchie Edwards (vocals/guitar). The name of the band was The Stone Gods.

In 2008, Justin Hawkins formed a new band, Hot Leg with Pete Rinaldi (of Anchorhead), Samuel SJ Stokes (formerly of The Thieves) and Darby Todd (from Protect the Beat). In 2009 Hot Leg released an album, &quot;Red Light Fever&quot;, which failed to make a dent on the charts (#81). Three singles were taken from it with two of them failing to chart.

By December 2010, both Hot Leg and The Stone Gods were in hiatus.

=== Reunion and &quot;Hot Cakes&quot; (2011–2013) ===
In March 2011, the four original band members reunited. They played three warm-up shows in Norwich, Leamington and at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, before performing at the 2011 Download Festival. This was followed by an &quot;intimate&quot; show at London&#x27;s 100 Club, which featured support from Dark Stares and notable appearances from Queen guitarist Brian May and comedian Rufus Hound. The band then toured Japan, the UK and Ireland.
A new song, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop Us&quot;, was released in February 2012 as a free download. They toured North America, playing with Crown Jewel Defense and Foxy Shazam, then performed at the Sweden Rock Festival in Sölvesborg, Sweden and the 18th Przystanek Woodstock. Singles &quot;Every Inch of You&quot; and &quot;Everybody Have a Good Time&quot; were released in May and June 2012, respectively, ahead of their third album, &quot;Hot Cakes&quot;, which came out in August. Throughout the summer the Darkness played a series of festival dates, including headlining the Big Top Tent at the 2012 Isle of Wight Festival, and were the opening act for the European, Latin American and African leg of Lady Gaga&#x27;s The Born This Way Ball world tour.

A new non-album song, &quot;The Horn&quot;, was released in late 2013 as a digital download.

===&quot;Last of Our Kind&quot; and new line-up (2014–2017)===
The band began work on their fourth studio album in September 2014, with Emily Dolan Davies replacing Ed Graham on drums. The new album, &quot;Last of Our Kind&quot;, was released on 2 June 2015, on the band&#x27;s own label Canary Dwarf Records via Kobalt Label Services with a single, &quot;Open Fire&quot;, released on 23 March. The first track from the album to be premiered was &quot;Barbarian&quot;, which was released with an accompanying animated music video on 23 February.

On 21 April 2015, the band issued a statement saying that drummer Davies had left the band. On 25 April 2015, it was announced via the band&#x27;s official Facebook page that Rufus Taylor, the son of Queen drummer Roger Taylor, was to join the band as Davies&#x27; replacement on drums.

They were announced as the first headline act for Planet Rockstock 2015, taking place at Trecco Bay in South Wales from 4 to 7 December 2015. The Darkness closed the event on 6 December.

On 20 November 2015, the band released a music video for a new Christmas single, entitled &quot;I Am Santa&quot; on their YouTube Channel, which it was announced would be included in the deluxe edition of the &quot;Last of Our Kind&quot; album.

===&quot;Pinewood Smile&quot; (2017–2019)===
The Darkness worked on a feature-length documentary, directed by Simon Emmett. In a 2016 interview, Frankie Poullain said, &quot;We are currently over a year in to a feature-length documentary which will surprise a lot of people.&quot;

In March 2017, the Darkness announced that their fifth studio album would be released in 2017. This was confirmed in a July issue of &quot;Planet Rock&quot;, and later on the band&#x27;s Facebook page. The album&#x27;s title was later revealed as &quot;Pinewood Smile&quot;, and was due to be released on 6 October of the same year. The first single from the album &quot;All The Pretty Girls&quot; was released on 22 July of that year.
 The band embarked on a winter tour of the UK in November and December 2017.

In May 2017, the Darkness performed at the Australian touring music festival Groovin&#x27; the Moo, performing at six regional cities across Australia. They performed as a de facto opening act for the &quot;headline act&quot; of the festival, Violent Soho, and supported Guns N&#x27; Roses on the European leg of their tour.

In December 2017, Justin &amp; Dan Hawkins were contestants on the &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot; Christmas special.

In 2018, the band supported US supergroup Hollywood Vampires on their European tour, which included their first performances in UK arenas in several years. They also announced their first live album, &quot;Live at Hammersmith&quot;, a recording of their December 2017 concert at the Eventim Apollo in London. This was released on 15 June 2018.

The band contributed theme music to the British children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Catie&#x27;s Amazing Machines&quot; which premiered on CBeebies in October 2018.

===&quot;Easter Is Cancelled&quot; (2019–2021)===
In 2019, the Darkness released their sixth studio album &quot;Easter Is Cancelled&quot; on 4 October 2019 through Cooking Vinyl. &quot;Easter Is Cancelled&quot; became the band&#x27;s fourth UK Top 10 album and topped the Official Charts Top 40 Rock And Metal Chart and the iTunes Rock Chart, while the record has achieved over 3 million streams on Spotify alone.

The album was released to a generally positive response from music critics while the previous singles &quot;Heart Explodes&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Deserves to Die&quot; proved a radio hit on the playlists of Radio 2, Absolute, Kerrang and more. The comedic video for &quot;Rock and Roll Deserves to Die&quot; has also individually surpassed 1 million views.

In January 2020, the Darkness released a new video for &quot;In Another Life&quot; which featured model Abbey Clancy. The track then made the BBC Radio 2 B-List.

The band commenced their UK tour of the &quot;Easter Is Cancelled&quot; album on 25 November 2019 in Ireland, culminating on 20 December at London&#x27;s Roundhouse.

In 2020, the band attempted a worldwide tour across Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and North America. The tour abruptly ended in Adelaide, Australia on 15 March as the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home orders set in. The band returned to the UK for occasional shows and live streams where possible, with an aim to reschedule the remainder of the postponed New Zealand and North American dates in the future.

In December the band played a one-off show at The IndigO2 in London. Initial plans to open the show and sound check to a limited audience were shut down at the last minute due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The show still went ahead but only accessible by live stream. The whole show was recorded for a live album titled &quot;Streaming Of A White Christmas&quot;, scheduled to be released on CD and vinyl in early 2021.

===&quot;Motorheart&quot; and &quot;Dreams on Toast&quot; (2021–present)===
For most of the first half of 2021 the band remained largely quiet on social media. On 4 June 2021, the band announced they were set to release their seventh studio album &quot;Motorheart&quot; in October. The album was eventually released on 19 November 2021. The album&#x27;s cover was also unveiled in the announcement. The first single, &quot;Motorheart&quot;, was released in August 2021. Along with the album release, the band announced an extensive list of UK tour dates to take place throughout November and December in support of the release of the album.

In January and February 2023, the band played UK arenas with Black Stone Cherry for the band&#x27;s first UK arena tour since 2006.

In November 2023, the band released a feature documentary film called &quot;Welcome To The Darkness&quot;, for a one night cinema release. It was available on DVD by December 2023.

On 18 September 2024, The Darkness announced that their eighth studio album &quot;Dreams on Toast&quot; will be released in March 2025.

In March 2025 the band are touring the new album for a tour across the UK. The final night will be held at Wembley arena

<doc id="382074" wikidata="Q20818855" url="?curid=382074" title="Vinča symbols">
<text>The Vinča symbols are a set of undeciphered symbols found on artifacts from the Neolithic Vinča culture and other &quot;Old European&quot; cultures of Central and Southeast Europe. They have sometimes been described as an example of proto-writing. The symbols went out of use around 3500 BC. Many scholars agree that the &quot;writing&quot; itself is not based on any language whatsoever and it is mostly symbolic.

==Discovery==
In 1875, archaeological excavations directed by the Hungarian archaeologist Baroness Zsófia Torma (1840–1899) at Tordos (present Turdaș, Romania) unearthed marble and fragments of pottery inscribed with previously unknown symbols. At the site, on the Maros river, a feeder into a tributary of the Danube, female figurines, pots, and artifacts made of stone were also found. In 1908, a similar cache was found during excavations directed by Serbian archaeologist Miloje Vasić (1869–1956) in Vinča, a suburb of Belgrade, some from Turdaș. Later, more such fragments were found in Banjica, another part of Belgrade. Since 1875, over 150 Vinča sites have been identified in Serbia alone, but many, including Vinča itself, have not been fully excavated.

The discovery of the Tărtăria tablets in Romania by a team directed by Nicolae Vlassa in 1961 revived debate regarding the inscriptions. Vlassa believed them to be pictograms. Other items found at the site of the discovery were subsequently radiocarbon-dated to before 4000 BC, around 1,300 years earlier than the date Vlassa expected and pre-dating the writing systems of the Sumerians and Minoans. However, the circumstances of their discovery and authenticity of the tablets themselves is disputed.

The Gradeshnitsa tablets are clay artefacts with incised marks. They were unearthed in 1969 near the village of Gradeshnitsa in the Vratsa Province of north-western Bulgaria. The tablets are dated to the 4th millennium BC and are currently preserved in the History Museum of Vratsa.

== Corpus ==


Although a large number of symbols are known, most artifacts contain so few symbols that they are very unlikely to represent a complete text. 

Most of the inscriptions are on pottery, with the remainder appearing on ceramic spindle whorls, figurines, and a small collection of other objects. The symbols themselves consist of a variety of abstract and representative pictograms, including zoomorphic (animal-like) representations, combs or brush patterns and abstract symbols such as swastikas, crosses and chevrons. Over 85% of the inscriptions consist of a single symbol. Other objects include groups of symbols, of which some are arranged in no particularly obvious pattern, with the result that neither the order nor the direction of the signs in these groups is readily determinable. The usage of symbols varies significantly between objects; symbols that appear by themselves tend almost exclusively to appear on pots, while symbols that are grouped with other symbols tend to appear on whorls. Quantitative linguistic analysis leads to the conclusion that 59% of the signs share the properties of pottery marks, 11.5% are part of asymmetric ornaments typical for whorls of the Vinča culture, and 29.5% may represent some sort of symbolic (semasiographic) notation.

A database of Vinča inscriptions, DatDas, has been developed by Marco Merlini:

=== Dating ===
These findings are important because the bulk of the Vinča symbols were created between 4,500 and 4,000 BC, with the symbols on the Tărtăria clay tablets possibly dating back to around 5,300 BC (controversially dated by association). This means that the Vinča finds predate the proto-Sumerian pictographic script from Uruk (modern Iraq), which is usually considered to be the oldest known writing system, by more than a thousand years. Analyses of the symbols showed that they have little similarity with Near Eastern writing, resulting in the opinion that these symbols and the Sumerian script probably arose independently.

== Interpretations ==
The nature of the symbols is unknown. Attempts to interpret the symbols have been made, but have not led to any agreement among scholars. It is unlikely that they represent a writing system. However, use of proto-writing systems featuring ideographic symbols may date as early as the Lower Paleolithic. The Vinča symbols may have served a range of purposes, such as representing ownership, individual or communal identities, or themes of a sacred or religious nature.

=== Property ===
Some researchers, such as and Dragoslav Srejović, have suggested that the symbols were potters&#x27; marks or owners&#x27; marks, meaning &quot;this belongs to &quot;. Some symbols, principally those restricted to the base of pots, are wholly unique and such signs may denote the contents, the provenance or destination, or the manufacturer or owner of the pot. However, some of the symbols have been repeatedly found throughout the territory of the Vinča culture, dated hundreds of years apart, and in locations kilometers away from each other.

=== Numerals ===
Some of the &quot;comb&quot; or &quot;brush&quot; symbols, which collectively constitute as much as a sixth of all the symbols so far discovered, may represent a form of prehistoric counting. The Vinča culture appears to have traded its wares quite widely with other cultures, as demonstrated by the widespread distribution of inscribed pots, so it is possible that the &quot;numerical&quot; symbols conveyed information about the value of the pots or their contents. Other cultures, such as the Minoans and Sumerians, initially developed their scripts as accounting tools; the Vinča symbols may have served a similar purpose.

=== Religious symbolism ===
The symbols may have been used for ritual or commemorative purposes. If this was so the fact that the same symbols were used for centuries with little change suggests that the ritual meaning and culture represented by the symbols likewise remained constant for a very long duration, undergoing little further development during that time. However, the use of the symbols seems to have been abandoned (along with the objects on which they appear) at the start of the Bronze Age, suggesting that the new technology brought with it significant changes in social organization or population, and beliefs.

The anthropologist Marija Gimbutas interpreted the inscribed objects as votive offerings. One argument in favour of the ritual explanation is that the objects on which the symbols appear do not seem to have had much long-term significance to their owners – they are commonly found in pits and other refuse areas. Certain objects, principally figurines, are most usually found buried under houses. This is consistent with the supposition that they were prepared for household religious ceremonies in which the signs incised on the objects represent expressions: a desire, request, vow, etc. After the ceremony was completed, the object would either have no further significance (hence would be disposed of) or would be buried ritually.

=== Proto-writing ===
It is unlikely that the Vinča symbols represent an early writing system. It is not likely that the stateless societies of Neolithic Europe would have had cause to independently invent writing, which was developed in Mesopotamia to facilitate accounting as required for the administration of political and economic systems in early state societies. There is no evidence that such institutions existed in the Vinča culture.

Some researchers, such as Marija Gimbutas and archaeo-semiologist Marco Merlini, have argued that the Vinča symbols belonged to a wider tradition of literacy in Old Europe, which they referred to the &quot;Old European script&quot; and the &quot;Danube script&quot; respectively. Gimbutas reconstructed a hypothetical pre-Indo-European &quot;Civilization of Old Europe&quot;, defined as having occupied the area between the Dniester valley and the Sicily-Crete line. She incorporated the Vinča markings into her model of Old Europe, suggesting that they might either be the writing system for an Old European language, or more probably a system of proto-writing. This view has been generally met with skepticism. The symbols themselves have not been discovered outside of an area comprising Serbia (i.e., Vinča itself), southeastern Hungary, western Romania, and western Bulgaria.

<text>The slant-top desk, also called secretary desk, or more properly, a bureau, is a piece of writing furniture with a lid that closes at an angle and opens up as a writing surface. It can be considered related, in form, to the desk on a frame, which was a form of portable desk in earlier eras.

== History ==
The first pieces that not only resembled the bureau, but also carried the bureau name, were manufactured in France in the middle of the 17th century. Both the name (that comes from the Medieval French and hints at the type of the linen used as a pad for writing) and antecedents are much older. A medieval example is provided by a Swedish desk with a sloped surface made at the turn of the 13th century, although writing boxes, and not freestanding furniture, were typical prior to Renaissance, when cabinets with a drop-leaf board for writing started to appear in Italy and Spain (cf. Bargueño desk).

The 17-th century France bureau Mazarin had inspired a bureau brisé, where the hinged decorative top can be lifted to reveal a space for writing. While French went on to creating a regular four-legged writing desk under a name &quot;bureau plat&quot;, in England designs acquired the sloping flap that covered the interior and doubled as a writing surface when opened. By 1700 the English bureaus switched from supporting legs to set drawers all the way to the floor; one of the most popular versions was the bureau-cabinet with a tall cabinet above the desk. The designs from England quickly spread throughout the Northern Europe and Italy, in the process getting elaborate outlines.
== In the USA ==
In the United States, the slant-top desk is sometimes called a Governor Winthrop desk, in memory of John Winthrop, the 17th century governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. As Winthrop died in 1647, he had no actual connection to this style of desk, which originated in the 18th century and is especially associated with Chippendale. The name &quot;Winthrop&quot; was attached to this kind of desk by the Winthrop Furniture Co. of Boston, Massachusetts, who offered their &quot;Gov. Winthrop&quot; desk in 1924, during the colonial revival period.

Like the Wooton desk, the fall-front desk and others with a hinged desktop (and unlike closable desks with an unmovable desktop like the rolltop desk or the cylinder desk), all documents and various items must be removed from the work surface of the slant-top desk before closing up. 

The slant-top desk has been handcrafted in a variety of styles, one of them being the block front seashell desk of the 18th century which was popular among the well-to-do of Colonial America.

== Modern ==
The slant-top desk has also been mass-produced in a great quantity of sub-forms and materials. For instance, some slant-top desks have very crude chains or levers to hold the desktop in an open working position, while others have elegant sliders (&quot;lopers&quot;) which are manually or automatically extended to give support.

<text>Bonneville Lock and Dam consists of several run-of-the-river dam structures that together complete a span of the Columbia River between the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington at River Mile 146.1. The dam is located east of Portland, Oregon, in the Columbia River Gorge. The primary functions of Bonneville Lock and Dam are electrical power generation and river navigation. The dam was built and is managed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. At the time of its construction in the 1930s it was the largest water impoundment project of its type in the nation, able to withstand flooding on an unprecedented scale. Electrical power generated at Bonneville is distributed by the Bonneville Power Administration. Bonneville Dam is named for Army Capt. Benjamin Bonneville, an early explorer credited with charting much of the Oregon Trail. The Bonneville Dam Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1987.

== History ==

In 1896, prior to this damming of the river, the Cascade Locks and Canal were constructed, allowing ships to pass the Cascades Rapids, located several miles upstream of Bonneville.

Prior to the New Deal, development of the Columbia River to provide flood control, hydroelectricity, navigation, and irrigation was deemed to be important. In 1929, the US Army Corps of Engineers published the Columbia River 308 Report that recommended ten dams on the river, but no action was taken until the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration and the New Deal. During this period, America was in the Great Depression, and the dam&#x27;s construction provided jobs and other economic benefits to the Pacific Northwest. Inexpensive hydroelectricity gave rise to a strong aluminum industry in the area (which has totally shut down since then). With funding from the Public Works Administration in 1934, two of the larger projects were started, the Grand Coulee Dam and the Bonneville Dam. Working in non-stop eight-hour shifts, 3,000 laborers from the relief or welfare rolls were paid 50 cents an hour for the work on the dam and raising local roads for the reservoir.

To create the Bonneville Locks and Dam, the Army Corps of Engineers first built one of the largest scale models in history of the proposed dam, the section of river on which it was to be located, and its various components to aid in the study of the construction. First a new lock and a powerhouse were constructed on the south (Oregon) side of Bradford Island, and a spillway on the north (Washington) side. Cofferdams were built to block half of the river and clear a construction site where the foundation could be reached. These projects, part of the Bonneville Dam, were completed in 1937.

Both the cascades and the old lock structure were submerged by the Bonneville Reservoir, also known as Lake Bonneville, the reservoir that formed behind the dam. The original navigation lock at Bonneville opened in 1938 and was, at that time, the highest single-lift lock in the world, with a vertical lift of 60 feet. Although the dam began to produce hydroelectricity in 1937, commercial electricity began its transfer from the dam in 1938.

A second powerhouse and dam structure were started in 1974 and completed in 1981. The second powerhouse was built by widening the river channel on the Washington side, creating Cascades Island between the new powerhouse and the original spillway. The combined rated capacity electrical output of the two power houses at Bonneville is now 1.2 gigawatts.

Despite its world record size in 1938, Bonneville Lock became the smallest of eight locks, including seven built subsequently at different locations upstream on the Columbia and Snake rivers. Eventually a new lock was needed at Bonneville; this new structure was built on the Oregon shore, opening to ship and barge traffic in 1993. The old lock is still present, but it is no longer used.

The largest fish hatchery in Oregon, called Bonneville Fish Hatchery, is located next to Bonneville Dam. It is a tourist destination that is often connected to Bonneville Dam tourism.

== Environmental and social implications ==

The Bonneville Dam blocked the migration of white sturgeon to their upstream spawning areas. Sturgeon still spawn in the area below the dam, and the lower Columbia River supports a healthy sturgeon population. Small, very depressed populations of white sturgeon persist in the various reservoirs upstream.

The dam features fish ladders to help native salmon and steelhead get past the dam on their journey upstream to spawn. The large concentrations of fish swimming upstream serve as a tourist attraction during the spawning season. California sea lions are also attracted to the large number of fish, and are often seen around the base of the dam during the spawning season. By 2006, the growing number of sea lions and their impact on the salmon population had become worrisome to the Army Corps of Engineers and environmentalists. Historically, pinnipeds such as sea lions and seals have hunted salmon in the Columbia River as far as The Dalles and Celilo Falls, farther upstream from Bonneville, as remarked upon by people such as George Simpson in 1841.

== Electricity controversy ==

Creating electricity was a sensitive issue at the time of the Bonneville Dam&#x27;s construction, which was funded with federal dollars. The Franklin D. Roosevelt administration wanted the electricity produced to be a public source of power and prevent energy monopolies. Advocates for private sale of the electricity were opposed to this, and they did not want the government to interfere. In 1937, the Bonneville Project Act was signed by Roosevelt, giving the dam&#x27;s power over to the public and creating the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). A rate of $17.50 per kilowatt-year (about 0.2 cents/kWh) was maintained by the BPA for the next 28 years.

Power production is the primary function of the Bonneville Dam. The two Bonneville powerhouses generate about 5 billion kWh of electricity each year. The Bonneville Dam supplies nearly 500,000 homes with electricity, assuming each household consumes 10,000 kWh of electricity per year. In 1998, its generation costs were about 1.2 cents/kWh, which was much higher than historic costs mainly because the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) was still paying off the second powerhouse which was built in 1982. Consumers were charged 2.3 cents/kWh to account for transmission and other costs.

<doc id="382081" wikidata="Q41172219" url="?curid=382081" title="List of stations in London fare zone 2">
<text>Fare zone 2 is an inner zone of Transport for London&#x27;s zonal fare system used for calculating the price of tickets for travel on the London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway and, since 2007, on National Rail services.

==Background==
London is split into six approximately concentric zones for the purpose of determining the cost of single fares and Travelcards. Every London Underground line—except for the Waterloo &amp; City line—has stations in zone 2. It was created on 22 May 1983 and extends from approximately from Piccadilly Circus.

==List of stations==

The following stations are in zone 2:
