<text>The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), also known as the Asiatic elephant, is a species of elephant distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, from India in the west to Borneo in the east, and Nepal in the north to Sumatra in the south. Three subspecies are recognised—&quot;E. m. maximus&quot;, &quot;E. m. indicus&quot; and &quot;E. m. sumatranus&quot;. The Asian elephant is characterised by its long trunk with a single finger-like processing; large tusks in males; laterally folded large ears but smaller in contrast to African elephants; and wrinkled grey skin. The skin is smoother than African elephants and may be depigmented on the trunk, ears or neck. Adult males average in weight, and females .

It is one of only three living species of elephants or elephantids anywhere in the world, the others being the African bush elephant and African forest elephant. Further, the Asian elephant is the only living species of the genus &quot;Elephas&quot;. It is the second largest species of elephant after the African bush elephant. It frequently inhabits grasslands, tropical evergreen forests, semi-evergreen forests, moist deciduous forests, dry deciduous forests and dry thorn forests. They are herbivorous, eating about of vegetation per day. Cows and calves form groups, while males remain solitary or form &quot;bachelor groups&quot; with other males. During the breeding season, males will temporarily join female groups to mate. Asian elephants have a large and well-developed neocortex of the brain, are highly intelligent and self-aware being able to display behaviors associated with grief, learning, greeting etc.

The Asian elephant is the largest living land animal in Asia. Since 1986, the Asian elephant has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, as the population has declined by at least 50 per cent over the last three elephant generations, which is about 60–75 years. It is primarily threatened by loss of habitat, habitat degradation, fragmentation and poaching. Wild Asian elephants live to be about 60 years old. While female captive elephants are recorded to have lived beyond 60 years when kept in semi-natural surroundings, Asian elephants die at a much younger age in captivity; captive populations are declining due to a low birth and high death rate. The earliest indications of captive use of Asian elephants are engravings on seals of the Indus Valley civilisation dated to the 3rd millennium BC.

== Taxonomy ==

Carl Linnaeus proposed the scientific name &quot;Elephas maximus&quot; in 1758 for an elephant from Ceylon. &quot;Elephas indicus&quot; was proposed by Georges Cuvier in 1798, who described an elephant from India. Coenraad Jacob Temminck named an elephant from Sumatra &quot;Elephas sumatranus&quot; in 1847. Frederick Nutter Chasen classified all three as subspecies of the Asian elephant in 1940. These three subspecies are currently recognised as valid taxa. Results of phylogeographic and morphological analyses indicate that the Sri Lankan and Indian elephants are not distinct enough to warrant classification as separate subspecies.

Three subspecies are recognised:

*Sri Lankan elephant (&quot;E. maximus maximus&quot; )

*Indian elephant (&quot;E. maximus indicus&quot; ) 

*Sumatran elephant (&quot;E. maximus sumatranus&quot; )
Sri Lankan elephants are the largest subspecies. Their skin colour is darker than of &quot;E. m. indicus&quot; and of &quot;E. m. sumatranus&quot; with larger and more distinct patches of depigmentation on ears, face, trunk and belly. The skin color of the Indian elephant is generally grey and lighter than that of &quot;E. m. maximus&quot; but darker than that of &quot;E. m. sumatranus&quot;.

A potential fourth subspecies, the Borneo elephant (&quot;Elephas maximus borneensis&quot;), occurs in Borneo&#x27;s northeastern parts, primarily in Sabah (Malaysia), and sometimes in Kalimantan (Indonesia). It was proposed by Paules Deraniyagala in 1950, who described an elephant in an illustration published in the &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine, but not as a living elephant in accordance with the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. These elephants living in northern Borneo are smaller than all the other subspecies, but had larger ears, a longer tail, and straight tusks. Results of genetic analysis indicate that their ancestors separated from the mainland population about 300,000 years ago. A study in 2003, using mitochondrial DNA analysis and microsatellite data, indicated that the Borneo elephant population is derived from stock that originated in the region of the Sunda Islands, and suggests that the Borneo population has been separated from the other elephant populations of southeast Asia since the Pleistocene.

The following Asian elephants were proposed as extinct subspecies, but are now considered synonymous with the Indian elephant:
* Syrian elephant (&quot;E. m. asurus&quot;), proposed by Deraniyagala, based on fossil remains and Bronze Age illustrations.
* Chinese elephant (&quot;E. m. rubridens&quot;), also proposed by Deraniyagala, based on a Chinese bronze statuette.
* Javan elephant (&quot;E. m. sondaicus&quot;), also proposed by Deraniyagala, based on an illustration of a carving on the Buddhist monument of Borobudur.

=== Evolution ===
The genus &quot;Elephas&quot;, of which the Asian elephant is the only living member, is the closest relative of the extinct mammoths. The two groups are estimated to have split from each other around 7 million years ago. 
&quot;Elephas&quot; originated in Sub-Saharan Africa during the Pliocene and spread throughout Africa before expanding into the southern half of Asia. The earliest &quot;Elephas&quot; species, &quot;Elephas ekorensis&quot;, is known from the Early Pliocene of East Africa, around 5–4.2 million years ago. The oldest remains of the genus in Asia are known from the Siwalik Hills in the Indian subcontinent, dating to the late Pliocene, around 3.6-3.2 million years ago, assigned to the species &quot;Elephas planifrons.&quot; The modern Asian elephant is suggested to have evolved from the species &quot;Elephas hysudricus&quot;, which first appeared at the beginning of the Early Pleistocene around 2.6 million years ago, and is primarily known from remains of Early-Middle Pleistocene age found on the Indian subcontinent.&quot;&quot; Skeletal remains of &quot;E. m. asurus&quot; have been recorded from the Middle East: Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey from periods dating between at least 1800 BC and likely 700 BC.

== Description ==

In general, the Asian elephant is smaller than the African bush elephant and has the highest body point on the head. The back is convex or level. The ears are small with dorsal borders folded laterally. It has up to 20 pairs of ribs and 34 caudal vertebrae. The feet have five nail-like structures on each forefoot, and four on each hind foot. The forehead has two hemispherical bulges, unlike the flat front of the African elephants. Its long trunk or proboscis has only one fingerlike tip, in contrast to the African elephants which have two. Hence, the Asian species relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth, rather than grasping with the tip. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks.Cows usually lack tusks; if tusks—in that case, called &quot;tushes&quot;—are present, they are barely visible and only seen when the mouth is open. The enamel plates of the molars are greater in number and closer together in Asian elephants. Some bulls may also lack tusks; these individuals are called &quot;makhnas&quot;, and are especially common among the Sri Lankan elephant population. A tusk from an tall elephant killed by Sir Victor Brooke measured in length, and nearly in circumference, and weighed . This tusk&#x27;s weight is, however, exceeded by the weight of a shorter tusk of about in length which weighed , and there have reportedly been tusks weighing over .

Skin colour is usually grey, and may be masked by soil because of dusting and wallowing. Their wrinkled skin is movable and contains many nerve centres. It is smoother than that of African elephants and may be depigmented on the trunk, ears, or neck. The epidermis and dermis of the body average thick; skin on the dorsum is thick providing protection against bites, bumps, and adverse weather. Its folds increase surface area for heat dissipation. They can tolerate cold better than excessive heat. Skin temperature varies from . Body temperature averages .

===Size===
On average, when fully-grown, bulls are about tall at the shoulder and in weight, while cows are smaller at about at the shoulder and in weight. Sexual dimorphism in body size is relatively less pronounced in Asian elephants than in African bush elephants; with bulls averaging 15% and 23% taller in the former and latter respectively. Length of body and head including trunk is with the tail being long. The largest bull elephant ever recorded was shot by the Maharajah of Susang in the Garo Hills of Assam, India, in 1924, it weighed an estimated , stood tall at the shoulder and was long from head to tail. The Raja Gaj elephant of Bardia National Park was estimated to be tall at the shoulder and one of the biggest Asian bull elephant. There are reports of larger individuals as tall as .


== Distribution and habitat ==
Asian elephants are distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, from India in the west, to Borneo in the east, and Nepal in the north, to Sumatra in the south. They inhabit grasslands, tropical evergreen forests, semi-evergreen forests, moist deciduous forests, dry deciduous forests and dry thorn forests, in addition to cultivated and secondary forests and scrublands. Over this range of habitat types elephants occur from sea level to over . In the eastern Himalaya in northeast India, they regularly move up above in summer at a few sites.

In Bangladesh, some isolated populations survived in the south-east Chittagong Hills in the early 1990s. In Malaysia&#x27;s northern Johor and Terengganu National Park, two Asian elephants tracked using satellite tracking technology spent most of their time in secondary or &quot;logged-over forest&quot;; they travelled 75% of their time in an area less than away from a water source. In China, the Asian elephant survives only in the prefectures of Xishuangbanna, Simao and Lincang of southern Yunnan. , the estimated population was around 300 individuals.

As of 2017, the estimated wild population in India account for nearly three-fourths of the extant population, at 27,312 individuals. In 2019, the Asian elephant population in India increased to an estimated 27,000–29,000 individuals. , the global wild population was estimated at 48,323–51,680 individuals.

==Ecology and behaviour==
Asian elephants are crepuscular. They are classified as megaherbivores and consume up to of plant matter per day. Around 50 to 75% of the day is devoted to eating. They are generalist feeders, and are both grazers and browsers. They are known to feed on at least 112 different plant species, most commonly of the order Malvales, as well as the legume, palm, sedge and true grass families. They browse more in the dry season with bark constituting a major part of their diet in the cool part of that season. They drink at least once a day and are never far from a permanent source of fresh water. They need 80–200 litres of water a day and use even more for bathing. At times, they scrape the soil for clay or minerals.


Cows and calves move about together as groups, while bulls disperse from their mothers upon reaching adolescence. Bulls are solitary or form temporary &quot;bachelor groups&quot;. Cow-calf units generally tend to be small, typically consisting of three adults (most likely related females) and their offspring. Larger groups of as many as 15 adult females have also been recorded. Seasonal aggregations of 17 individuals including calves and young adults have been observed in Sri Lanka&#x27;s Uda Walawe National Park. Until recently, Asian elephants, like African elephants, were thought to be under the leadership of older adult females, or matriarchs. It is now recognized that cows form extensive and very fluid social networks, with varying degrees of associations between individuals. Social ties generally tend to be weaker than in African bush elephants. Unlike African elephants, which rarely use their forefeet for anything other than digging or scraping soil, Asian elephants are more agile at using their feet in conjunction with the trunk for manipulating objects. They can sometimes be known for their violent behavior.

Asian elephants are recorded to make three basic sounds: growls, squeaks and snorts. Growls in their basic form are used for short distance communication. During mild arousal, growls resonate in the trunk and become rumbles while for long-distance communication, they escalate into roars. Low-frequency growls are infrasonic and made in many contexts. Squeaks come in two forms: chirpings and trumpets. Chirping consists of multiple short squeaks and signals conflict and nervousness. Trumpets are lengthened squeaks with increased loudness and are produced during extreme arousal. Snorts signal changes in activity and increase in loudness during mild or strong arousal. During the latter case, when an elephant bounces the tip of the trunk, it creates booms which serve as threat displays. Elephants can distinguish low-amplitude sounds.

Rarely, tigers have been recorded attacking and killing calves, especially if the calves become separated from their mothers, stranded from their herd, or orphaned. Adults are largely invulnerable to natural predation. There is a singular anecdotal case of a mother Asian elephant allegedly being killed alongside her calf; however, this account is contestable. In 2011 and 2014, two instances were recorded of tigers successfully killing adult elephants; one by a single tiger in Jim Corbett National Park on a 20-year-old young adult elephant cow, and another on a 28-year-old sick adult bull in Kaziranga National Park further east, which was taken down and eaten by several tigers hunting cooperatively. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller predators like leopards; they react to leopards less fearfully and more aggressively.

=== Reproduction ===

Reproduction in Asian elephants can be attributed to the production and perception of signaling compounds called pheromones. These signals are transmitted through various bodily fluids. They are commonly released in urine but in males they are also found in special secretions from the temporal glands. Once integrated and perceived, these signals provide the receiver with information about the reproductive status of the sender. If both parties are ready to breed, reproductive ritualic behavior occurs and the process of sexual reproduction proceeds.

Bulls will fight one another to get access to cows. Strong fights over access to females are extremely rare. Bulls reach sexual maturity around the age of 12–15. Between the ages of 10 and 20 years, bulls undergo an annual phenomenon known as &quot;musth&quot;. This is a period where the testosterone level is up to 100 times greater than non-musth periods, and they become aggressive. Secretions containing pheromones occur during this period, from the paired temporal glands located on the head between the lateral edge of the eye and the base of the ear. The aggressive behaviors observed during musth can be attributed to varying amounts of frontalin (1,5-dimethyl-6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane) throughout the maturation process of bulls. Frontalin is a pheromone that was first isolated in bark beetles but can also be produced in the bulls of both Asian and African Elephants. The compound can be excreted through urine as well as through the temporal glands of the bull, allowing signaling to occur. During musth, increased concentrations of frontalin in the bull&#x27;s urine communicate the reproductive status of the bull to female elephants.
Similar to other mammals, hormone secretion in female elephants is regulated by an estrous cycle. This cycle is regulated by surges in Luteinizing hormone that are observed three weeks from each other. This type of estrous cycle has also been observed in African Elephants but is not known to affect other mammals. The first surge in Luteinizing hormone is not followed by the release of an egg from the ovaries. However, some female elephants still exhibit the expected mating protocols during this surge. Female elephants give ovulatory cues by utilizing sex pheromones. A principal component thereof, (Z)-7-dodecen-1-yl acetate, has also been found to be a sex pheromone in numerous species of insects. In both insects and elephants, this chemical compound is used as an attractant to assist the mating process. In elephants, the chemical is secreted through urination and this aids in the attraction of bulls to mate. Once detected, the chemical stimulates the vomeronasal organ of the bull, thus providing information on the maturity of the female.

Reproductive signaling exchange between male and female elephants are transmitted through olfactory cues in bodily fluids. In males, the increase in frontalin during musth heightens their sensitivity to the (Z)-7-dodecen-1-yl acetate produced by female elephants. Once perceived by receptors in the trunk, a sequence of ritualistic behaviors follow. The responses in males vary based on both the stage of development and the temperament of the elephant. This process of receiving and processing signals through the trunk is referred to as flehmen. The difference in body movements give cues to gauge if the male is interested in breeding with the female that produced the secretion. A bull that is ready to breed will move closer to the urine and in some cases an erection response is elicited. A bull that is not ready to breed will be timid and try to dissociate themselves from the signal. In addition to reproductive communication, chemosensory signaling is used to facilitate same-sex interactions. When less developed males detect pheromones from a male in musth, they often retreat to avoid coming in contact with aggressive behaviors. Female elephants have also been seen to communicate with each other through pheromone in urine. The purpose of this type of intersex communication is still being investigated. However, there are clear differences in signaling strength and receiver response throughout different stages of the estrous cycle.
The gestation period is 18–22 months, and the cow gives birth to one calf, only occasionally twins. The calf is fully developed by the 19th month, but stays in the womb to grow so that it can reach its mother to feed. At birth, the calf weighs about , and is suckled for up to three years. Once a female gives birth, she usually does not breed again until the first calf is weaned, resulting in a four to five-year birth interval. During this period, mother to calf communication primarily takes place through temporal means. However, male calves have been known to develop sex pheromone-producing organs at a young age. Early maturity of the vomeronasal organ allows immature elephants to produce and receive pheromones. It is unlikely that the integration of these pheromones will result in a flehmen response in a calf. Females stay on with the herd, but mature males are chased away.
Female Asian elephants sexually mature around the age of 10~15 and keep growing until 30, while males fully mature at more than the age of 25, and constantly grow throughout their life. Average elephant life expectancy is approximately 60 years. Some individuals are known to have lived into their late 80s. Generation length of the Asian elephant is 22 years.

===Intelligence===
Asian elephants have a very large and highly developed neocortex, a trait also shared by humans, apes and certain dolphin species. They have a greater volume of cerebral cortex available for cognitive processing than all other existing land animals. Results of studies indicate that Asian elephants have cognitive abilities for tool use and tool-making similar to great apes. They exhibit a wide variety of behaviours, including those associated with grief, learning, allomothering, mimicry, play, altruism, use of tools, compassion, cooperation, self-awareness, memory, and language. Elephants reportedly head to safer ground during natural disasters like tsunamis and earthquakes, but data from two satellite-collared Sri Lankan elephants indicate this may be untrue. Several students of elephant cognition and neuroanatomy are convinced that Asian elephants are highly intelligent and self-aware. Others contest this view.

==Threats==
The pre-eminent threats to the Asian elephant today are the loss, degradation and fragmentation of its habitat, which leads to increasing conflicts between humans and elephants. Asian elephants are poached for ivory and a variety of other products including meat and leather. The demand for elephant skin has risen due to it being an increasingly-common ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine.

=== Human–elephant conflict ===

In some parts of Asia, people and elephants have co-existed for thousands of years. In other areas, people and elephants come into conflict, resulting in violence, and ultimately, the displacement of elephants. The main causes of human-elephant conflict includes the growing human population, large-scale development projects and poor top-down governance. Proximate causes includes habitat loss due to deforestation, disruption of elephant migratory routes, expansion of agriculture and illegal encroachment into protected areas.

Destruction of forests through logging, encroachment, slash-and-burn, shifting cultivation, and monoculture tree plantations are major threats to the survival of elephants. Human–elephant conflicts occur when elephants raid crops of shifting cultivators in fields, which are scattered over a large area interspersed with forests. Depredation in human settlements is another major area of human–elephant conflict occurring in small forest pockets, encroachments into elephant habitat, and on elephant migration routes. However, studies in Sri Lanka indicate that traditional slash-and-burn agriculture may create optimal habitats for elephants by creating a mosaic of successional-stage vegetation. Populations inhabiting small habitat fragments are much more liable to come into conflict with humans.

Development such as border fencing along the India–Bangladesh border has become a major impediment to the free movement of elephants. In Assam, more than 1,150 humans and 370 elephants died as a result of human-elephant conflict between 1980 and 2003. In a 2010 study, it was estimated that in India alone, over 400 people were killed by elephants each year, and 0.8 to 1 million hectares were damaged, affecting at least 500,000 families across the country. Moreover, elephants are known to destroy crops worth up to US$2–3 million annually. This has major impacts on the welfare and livelihoods of local communities, as well as the future conservation of this species. In countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the Asian elephant is one of the most feared wild animals, even though they are less deadly than other local animals such as venomous snakes (which were estimated to claim more than 30 times more lives in Sri Lanka than elephants).

As a whole, Asian elephants display highly sophisticated and sometimes unpredictable behaviour. Most untamed elephants try to avoid humans, but if they are caught off guard by any perceived physical threat, including humans, they will likely charge. This is especially true of males in musth and of females with young. Gunfire and other similar methods of deterring, which are known to be effective against many kinds of wild animals including tigers, may or may not work with elephants, and can even worsen the situation. Elephants that have been abused by humans in the past often become &quot;rogue elephants&quot;, which regularly attack people with no provocation.

=== Poaching ===
====For ivory====
The demand for ivory during the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in East Asia, led to rampant poaching and the serious decline of elephants in both Africa and Asia. In Thailand, the illegal trade in live elephants and ivory still flourishes. Although the amount of ivory being openly sold has decreased substantially since 2001, Thailand still has one of the largest and most active black markets for ivory seen anywhere in the world. Tusks from Thai-poached elephants also enter the market; between 1992 and 1997 at least 24 male elephants were killed for their tusks.

Up to the early 1990s, Vietnamese ivory craftsmen used exclusively Asian elephant ivory from Vietnam and neighbouring Lao and Cambodia. Before 1990, there were few tourists and the low demand for worked ivory could be supplied by domestic elephants. Economic liberalisation and an increase in tourism raised both local and visitors&#x27; demands for worked ivory, which resulted in heavy poaching.

====For skin====
The skin of the Asian elephant is used as an ingredient in Chinese medicine as well as in the manufacture of ornamental beads. The practice has been aided by China&#x27;s State Forestry Administration (SFA), which has issued licences for the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products containing elephant skin, thereby making trading legal. In 2010, four skinned elephants were found in a forest in Myanmar; 26 elephants were killed by poachers in 2013 and 61 in 2016. According to the NGO Elephant Family, Myanmar is the main source of elephant skin, where a poaching crisis has developed rapidly since 2010.

===Disease===

The elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) is a member of the &quot;Proboscivirus&quot; genus, a novel clade most closely related to the mammalian betaherpesviruses. As of 2011, it is responsible for as many as 70 deaths of both zoo and wild Asian elephants worldwide, especially in young calves. In particular, several incidents of calves dying from elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus have been recorded in Myanmar. The elephant schistosome is a parasitic trematode that uses the Asian elephant as a definitive host. Two other hosts may be the Indian elephant and the greater one-horned rhinoceros.

== Conservation ==
The Asian elephant is listed on CITES Appendix I. It is a quintessential flagship species, deployed to catalyze a range of conservation goals, including habitat conservation at landscape scales, generating public awareness on conservation issues, and mobilisation as a popular cultural icon both in India and the West. A key aspect of conservation is connectivity of the preferred movement routes of Asian elephants through areas with high vegetation cover and low human population density.

The World Elephant Day is celebrated annually on 12 August since 2012. Events are organized to divulge information and to engage people about the problems that the Asian elephant is facing. August has been established as the Asian Elephant Awareness Month by zoos and conservation partners in the United States.

Karnataka state in India hosts the most Asian elephants of any known area, comprising around 20% of the total population in the country. The distribution of elephants in the state according to one estimate is roughly . In a 2013 study, an estimated 10, 000 elephants inhabited the Western Ghats, and were primarily threatened by poaching and habitat fragmentation. An increase in conflict with humans was also cited as a likely issue. Conservation plans aimed to establish wildlife corridors, stop poaching of bulls, and protect or manage land area. Project Elephant was initiated in 1992 as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of the Government of India. The project was initiated to protect the Indian elephant and its habitats and to establish dedicated elephant reserves for sustaining elephant populations.

The distribution of elephants in Sri Lanka is only two-fifths of what it was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Due to this decrease, interactions with humans occur much more frequently. During a 2003 survey, the local people expressed some form of disapproval towards the conservation of Asian elephants as farmers viewed them as pests, however, most of the participants were supportive of the idea.

In China, Asian elephants are under first-level protection. Yunnan province has 11 national and regional nature reserves. In total, the covered protected area in China is about . In 2020, the population of Asian elephants in Yunnan was estimated at around 300 individuals. As conflicts between humans and wild elephants have emerged around protected areas in the last years, the prefecture of Xishuangbanna built food bases and planted bananas and bamboo to create a better habitat.

In Thailand, Salakpra Wildlife Sanctuary and Tham Than Lot National Park are protected areas hosting around 250–300 elephants, according to figures from . In recent years the National Park has faced issues due to encroachment and over-exploitation. In India, the National Board of Wildlife recommended to allow coal mining in Dehing Patkai National Park in April 2020. The decision raised concerns between students and environmental activists who launched an online campaign to stop the project.

== In captivity ==

About half of the global zoo elephant population is kept in European zoos, where they have less than half (18.9 years) the median life span of conspecifics (41.6 years) in protected populations in range countries. This discrepancy is clearest in Asian elephants: infant mortality is more than two to three times that seen in Burmese timber camps, and adult survivorship in zoos has not improved significantly in recent years. One risk factor for Asian zoo elephants is being moved between institutions, with early removal from the mother tending to have additional adverse effects. Another risk factor is being born into a zoo rather than being imported from the wild, with poor adult survivorship in zoo-born Asians apparently being conferred prenatally or in early infancy. Likely causes for compromised survivorship is stress and/or obesity. Foot problems are commonly observed in captive elephants. These are related to lack of exercise, long hours standing on hard substrates, and contamination resulting from standing in their dung. Many of these problems are treatable. However, mistreatment may lead to serious disability or death.

Demographic analysis of captive Asian elephants in North America indicates that the population is not self-sustaining. First year mortality is nearly 30 per cent, and fecundity is extremely low throughout the prime reproductive years. Data from North American and European regional studbooks from 1962 to 2006 were analysed for deviations in the birth and juvenile death sex ratios. Of 349 captive calves born, 142 died prematurely. They died within one month of birth, major causes being stillbirth and infanticide by either the calf&#x27;s mother or by one of the exhibition mates. The sex ratio of stillbirths in Europe was found to have a tendency for excess of males.

=== Handling methods ===
Young elephants are captured from the wild and illegally imported to Thailand from Myanmar for use in the tourism industry; calves are used mainly in amusement parks and are trained to perform various stunts for tourists. The calves are often subjected to a &#x27;breaking in&#x27; process, which may involve being tied up, confined, starved, beaten and tortured; as a result, two-thirds may perish. Handlers use a technique known as the training crush, in which &quot;handlers use sleep-deprivation, hunger, and thirst to &quot;break&quot; the elephants&#x27; spirit and make them submissive to their owners&quot;; moreover, handlers drive nails into the elephants&#x27; ears and feet.

== In culture ==

The Asian elephant is the national animal of Thailand and Laos. It has also been declared as the national heritage animal of India. Bones of Asian elephants excavated at Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley indicate that they were tamed in the Indus Valley Civilisation and used for work. Decorated elephants are also depicted on seals and were modelled in clay. The Asian elephant became a siege engine, a mount in war, a status symbol, a beast of burden, and an elevated platform for hunting during historical times in South Asia.

Asian elephants have been captured from the wild and tamed for use by humans. Elephants can remember tone, melody, and words, allowing them to recognise more than 20 verbal commands. Their ability to work under instruction makes them particularly useful for carrying heavy objects. They have been used particularly for timber-carrying in jungle areas. Other than their work use, they have been used in war, in ceremonies, and for carriage. It is reported that war elephants are still used by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in Kachin State in northern Myanmar against Myanmar&#x27;s military. The KIA use about four dozen elephants to carry supplies.

The Asian elephant plays an important part in the culture of the subcontinent and beyond, being featured prominently in the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; fables and the Buddhist &quot;Jataka&quot; tales. They play a major role in Hinduism: the god Ganesha&#x27;s head is that of an elephant, and the &quot;blessings&quot; of a temple elephant are highly valued. Elephants are frequently used in processions where the animals are adorned with festive outfits.

The Asian elephant is depicted in several Indian manuscripts and treatises with notable amongst these including &quot;Matanga Lila&quot; (elephant sport) of Nilakantha. The manuscript &quot;Hastividyarnava&quot; is from Assam in northeast India. In the Burmese, Thai and Sinhalese animal and planetary zodiac, the Asian elephant, both tusked and tuskless, are the fourth and fifth animal zodiacs of the Burmese, the fourth animal zodiac of the Thai, and the second animal zodiac of the Sinhalese people of Sri Lanka. Similarly, the elephant is the twelfth animal zodiac in the Dai animal zodiac of the Dai people in southern China.

<text>Haywood Knowles Nelson Jr. (born March 25, 1960) is an American actor. He is best known for having portrayed Dwayne Nelson in the television series &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;, which aired from 1976 to 1979, as well as in its spin-off series &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot;, from 1985 to 1988.

==Biography==
Haywood Nelson has been a member of the entertainment community for over forty years. Born in New York, he began his career at the age of six with numerous principal on-camera and voice-over national commercials, including Lavoris, Campbell&#x27;s Soup, Libby&#x27;s, Polaroid, Hot Wheels, Rock&#x27;em Sock&#x27;em Robots, Johnny Lightning, Aurora AFX, Kodak, Duncan Hines, Milk, Burger King, and Dean Witter.

Nelson appeared as a co-star in several feature films, including &quot;If You Give a Dance, You Gotta Pay the Band&quot;, &quot;Mixed Company&quot; , &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot;, and a featuring role in &quot;Evilspeak&quot;. Haywood also spent a two-year run on Broadway in &quot;Thieves&quot;. Nelson guest starred on &quot;Kojak&quot; in the episode &quot;The Godson&quot; as Bobby Moore. At the age of 14, he went on to guest star in the television series &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; as the grandson of Whitman Mayo&#x27;s &quot;Grady&quot; then acting in the series of the same name, &quot;Grady&quot; in 1975. The next year, in 1976, at the age of 16, Haywood soon landed the role of &quot;Dwayne&quot; in the television series &quot;Cooley High,&quot; which became the ABC hit series &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; for TOY Productions. As a &quot;teenage heartthrob&quot; on a popular television series, Nelson was one of the first Black teen idols. After three seasons, Nelson went on to a short run on the television series &quot;The White Shadow&quot; for MTM Enterprises. Haywood had his studies in Architectural Design and Electronics Engineering interrupted when the cast of &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; was re-united for three seasons of syndication in the series continuation &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot; for Columbia Pictures Television where he also served as Technical Director. Haywood appeared in an urban dramatic Broadway production at New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center Alice Tully Hall. He appeared as himself in the Paramount film &quot;Dickie Roberts&quot; and on &quot;The Parkers&quot;.

He is a devout Scientologist.

<text>Forensic anthropology is the application of the anatomical science of anthropology and its various subfields, including forensic archaeology and forensic taphonomy, in a legal setting. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable, as might happen in a plane crash. Forensic anthropologists are also instrumental in the investigation and documentation of genocide and mass graves. Along with forensic pathologists, forensic dentists, and homicide investigators, forensic anthropologists commonly testify in court as expert witnesses. Using physical markers present on a skeleton, a forensic anthropologist can potentially determine a person&#x27;s age, sex, stature, and race. In addition to identifying physical characteristics of the individual, forensic anthropologists can use skeletal abnormalities to potentially determine cause of death, past trauma such as broken bones or medical procedures, as well as diseases such as bone cancer.

The methods used to identify a person from a skeleton relies on the past contributions of various anthropologists and the study of human skeletal differences. Through the collection of thousands of specimens and the analysis of differences within a population, estimations can be made based on physical characteristics. Through these, a set of remains can potentially be identified. The field of forensic anthropology grew during the twentieth century into a fully recognized forensic specialty involving trained anthropologists as well as numerous research institutions gathering data on decomposition and the effects it can have on the skeleton.

==Modern uses==

Today, forensic anthropology is a well-established discipline within the forensic field. Anthropologists are called upon to investigate remains and to help identify individuals from bones when other physical characteristics that could be used to identify a body no longer exist. Forensic anthropologists work in conjunction with forensic pathologists to identify remains based on their skeletal characteristics. If the victim is not found for a lengthy period or has been eaten by scavengers, flesh markers used for identification would be destroyed, making normal identification difficult if not impossible. Forensic anthropologists can provide physical characteristics of the person to input into missing person databases such as that of the National Crime Information Center in the US or INTERPOL&#x27;s yellow notice database.

In addition to these duties, forensic anthropologists often assist in the investigation of war crimes and mass fatality investigations. Anthropologists have been tasked with helping to identify victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as well as plane crashes such as the Arrow Air Flight 1285 disaster and the USAir Flight 427 disaster where the flesh had been vaporized or so badly mangled that normal identification was impossible. Anthropologists have also helped identify victims of genocide in countries around the world, often long after the actual event. War crimes anthropologists have helped investigate include the Rwandan genocide and the Srebrenica Genocide. Organizations such as the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe, the British Association for Forensic Anthropology, and the American Society of Forensic Anthropologists continue to provide guidelines for the improvement of forensic anthropology and the development of standards within the discipline.

With hundreds missing and bodies burnt beyond recognition by Hamas militants during its October 7 attack of Israel, Israeli authorities assembled recovery teams that included archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority. The team used their specialized skills in excavating and identifying fragmentary ancient remains to sift through ash and rubble for bone fragments overlooked by other forensic teams. Archeologists systematically searched rooms, dividing them into grids and carefully extracting bone shards. At one house, the archeology team found a bloodstain under ash that they determined was the outline of a body, later identified through DNA analysis.

==History==
===Early history===

The use of anthropology in the forensic investigation of remains grew out of the recognition of anthropology as a distinct scientific discipline and the growth of physical anthropology. The field of anthropology began in the United States and struggled to obtain recognition as a legitimate science during the early years of the twentieth century. Earnest Hooton pioneered the field of physical anthropology and became the first physical anthropologist to hold a full-time teaching position in the United States. He was an organizing committee member of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists along with its founder Aleš Hrdlička. Hooton&#x27;s students created some of the first doctoral programs in physical anthropology during the early 20th century. In addition to physical anthropology, Hooton was a proponent of criminal anthropology. Now considered a pseudoscience, criminal anthropologists believed that phrenology and physiognomy could link a person&#x27;s behavior to specific physical characteristics. The use of criminal anthropology to try to explain certain criminal behaviors arose out of the eugenics movement, popular at the time. It is because of these ideas that skeletal differences were measured in earnest eventually leading to the development of anthropometry and the Bertillon method of skeletal measurement by Alphonse Bertillon. The study of this information helped shape anthropologists&#x27; understanding of the human skeleton and the multiple skeletal differences that can occur.

Another prominent early anthropologist, Thomas Wingate Todd, was primarily responsible for the creation of the first large collection of human skeletons in 1912. In total, Todd acquired 3,300 human skulls and skeletons, 600 anthropoid skulls and skeletons, and 3,000 mammalian skulls and skeletons. Todd&#x27;s contributions to the field of anthropology remain in use in the modern era and include various studies regarding suture closures on the skull and timing of teeth eruption in the mandible. Todd also developed age estimates based on physical characteristics of the pubic symphysis. Though the standards have been updated, these estimates are still used by forensic anthropologists to narrow down an age range of skeletonized remains. These early pioneers legitimized the field of anthropology, but it was not until the 1940s, with the help of Todd&#x27;s student, Wilton M. Krogman, that forensic anthropology gained recognition as a legitimate subdiscipline.

===The growth of forensic anthropology===
During the 1940s, Krogman was the first anthropologist to actively publicize anthropologists&#x27; potential forensic value, going as far as placing advertisements in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin informing agencies of the ability of anthropologists to assist in the identification of skeletal remains. This period saw the first official use of anthropologists by federal agencies including the FBI. During the 1950s, the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps employed forensic anthropologists in the identification of war casualties during the Korean War. It was at this time that forensic anthropology officially began. The sudden influx of available skeletons for anthropologists to study, whose identities were eventually confirmed, allowed for the creation of more accurate formulas for the identification of sex, age, and stature based solely on skeletal characteristics. These formulas, developed in the 1940s and refined by war, are still in use by modern forensic anthropologists.

The professionalization of the field began soon after, during the 1950s and 1960s. This move coincided with the replacement of coroners with medical examiners in many locations around the country. It was during this time that the field of forensic anthropology gained recognition as a separate field within the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and the first forensic anthropology research facility and body farm was opened by William M. Bass. Public attention and interest in forensic anthropology began to increase around this time as forensic anthropologists started working on more high-profile cases. One of the major cases of the era involved anthropologist Charles Merbs who helped identify the victims murdered by Ed Gein.

==Methods==
One of the main tools forensic anthropologists use in the identification of remains is their knowledge of osteology and the differences that occur within the human skeleton. During an investigation, anthropologists are often tasked with helping to determinate an individual&#x27;s sex, stature, age, and ancestry. To do this, anthropologists must be aware of how the human skeleton can differ between individuals.

===Determination of sex===
Depending on which bones are present, sex can be determined by looking for distinctive sexual dimorphisms. When available, the pelvis is extremely useful in the determination of sex and when properly examined can achieve sex determination with a great level of accuracy. The examination of the pubic arch and the location of the sacrum can help determine sex.

However, the pelvis is not always present, so forensic anthropologists must be aware of other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers that can be used to determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal lines, and the mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.

Forensic anthropologists need to take into account all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, a female may have a slightly more narrow than a normal pubic arch. It is for this reason that anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, maybe male, indeterminate, maybe female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.

Consequently, there is currently no reliable method of sex determination of juvenile remains from cranial or post-cranial skeletal elements since dimorphic traits only become apparent after puberty, and this represents a fundamental problem in archaeological and forensic investigations. However, teeth may assist in estimating sex since both sets of teeth are formed well before puberty. Sexual dimorphism has been observed in both deciduous and permanent dentition, although it is much less in deciduous teeth. On average, male teeth are slightly larger than female teeth, with the greatest difference observed in the canine teeth. Examination of internal dental tissues has also shown that male teeth consist of absolutely and proportionately greater quantities of dentine than females. Such differences in dental tissue proportions could also be useful in sex determination.

===Determination of stature===
The estimation of stature by anthropologists is based on a series of formulas that have been developed over time by the examination of multiple different skeletons from a multitude of different regions and backgrounds. Stature is given as a range of possible values, in centimeters, and typically computed by measuring the bones of the leg. The three bones that are used are the femur, the tibia, and the fibula. In addition to the leg bones, the bones of the arm, humerus, ulna, and radius can be used. The formulas that are used to determine stature rely on various information regarding the individual. Sex, ancestry, and age should be determined before attempting to ascertain height, if possible. This is due to the differences that occur between populations, sexes, and age groups. By knowing all the variables associated with height, a more accurate estimate can be made. For example, a male formula for stature estimation using the femur is . A female of the same ancestry would use the formula, . It is also important to note an individual&#x27;s approximate age when determining stature. This is due to the shrinkage of the skeleton that naturally occurs as a person ages. After age 30, a person loses approximately one centimeter of their height every decade.

===Determination of age===
The determination of an individual&#x27;s age by anthropologists depends on whether or not the individual was an adult or a child. The determination of the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth. When teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which growth plates are sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The clavicle is the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25. In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number.

The aging of adult skeletons is not as straightforward as aging a child&#x27;s skeleton as the skeleton changes little once adulthood is reached. One possible way to estimate the age of an adult skeleton is to look at bone osteons under a microscope. New osteons are constantly formed by bone marrow even after the bones stop growing. Younger adults have fewer and larger osteons while older adults have smaller and more osteon fragments. Another potential method for determining the age of an adult skeleton is to look for arthritis indicators on the bones. Arthritis will cause noticeable rounding of the bones. The degree of rounding from arthritis coupled with the size and number of osteons can help an anthropologist narrow down a potential age range for the individual.

===Age estimation of living individuals===
Age estimation of living individuals is carried out by estimating the biological age when the chronological age of the individual is unknown or uncertain because of the lack of valid identity documents. It is used to confirm if an individual has reached a specific age threshold in cases of criminal liability, asylum seekers and unaccompanied children, human trafficking, adoption, and competitive sports. Guidelines by the Study Group on Forensic Age Diagnostics (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Forensische Altersdiagnostik, AGFAD), propose that a three-step procedure should be followed for the age estimation: the first step is a physical examination; the second step include the assessment of the hand/wrist development using plain radiographs; the third step is a dental assessment. One of the most used methodologies for the estimation of age from the development of the hand and wrist is the Greulich and Pyle Atlas, whilst to assess dental development the most common method used so far is the 8-teeth technique developed by Demirjian &quot;et al.&quot;. Where the estimated age of the individual might be above 18 years of age, it is possible to use the development of the medial end of the clavicle. Traditionally, those undertaking age estimation in the living, adopt imaging techniques such as plain radiographies and CT scans to carry out the age estimation, however, lately, due to ethical issues surrounding the use of ionising medical imaging modalities for non-medical purposes (e.g., forensic purposes), magnetic resonance imaging, a radiation free medical imaging modality, is being investigated to develop new methodologies to estimate the age of living individuals.

===Determination of ancestry===
The estimation of individuals&#x27; ancestry is typically grouped into three groups. However, the use of these classifications is becoming much harder as the rate of interancestrial marriages increases. The maxilla can be used to help anthropologists estimate an individual&#x27;s ancestry due to the three basic shapes: hyperbolic, parabolic, and rounded. In addition to the maxilla, the zygomatic arch and the nasal opening have been used to narrow down possible ancestry.

By measuring distances between landmarks on the skull as well as the size and shape of specific bones, anthropologists can use a series of equations to estimate ancestry. A program called FORDISC has been created that will calculate the most likely ancestry using complex mathematical formulas. This program is continually updated with new information from known individuals to maintain a database of current populations and their respective measurements. A 2009 study found that even in favourable circumstances, FORDISC 3.0 classifications have only a 1% confidence level. Research presented at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists concluded that ForDisc ancestry determination was not always consistent, and that the program should be used with caution. Determination of ancestry is incredibly controversial but often needed for police investigations to narrow down subject pool.

===Other markers===
Anthropologists are also able to see other markers present on the bones. Past fractures will be evident by the presence of bone remodeling but only for a certain amount of time. After around seven years, bone remodelling should make the presence of a fracture impossible to see. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine the type of trauma they may have experienced. Cause of death is not determined by the forensic anthropologist, as they are not qualified to do so. However, they are able to determine the type of trauma experienced such as gun shot wound, blunt force, sharp force, or a mixture thereof. It is also possible to determine if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing (depending on how long before death the fracture occurred) while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures can incorporate quite a large range of time, as ante-mortem trauma that is unrelated directly to death may not have had time to begin the healing process. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean with rounded margins and equal discolouration after death, while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Post-mortem breaks will often be a different colour to the surrounding bone i.e. whiter as they have been exposed to taphonomic processes for a different amount of time. However, depending on how long there is between a post-mortem break and removal this may not be obvious i.e. through re-interment by a killer. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.

==Subfields==
===Forensic archaeology===
The term &quot;forensic archaeology&quot; is not defined uniformly around the world, and is therefore practiced in a variety of ways.

Forensic archaeologists employ their knowledge of proper excavation techniques to ensure that remains are recovered in a controlled and forensically acceptable manner. When remains are found partially or completely buried the proper excavation of the remains will ensure that any evidence present on the bones will remain intact. The difference between forensic archaeologists and forensic anthropologists is that where forensic anthropologists are trained specifically in human osteology and recovery of human remains, forensic archaeologists specialize more broadly in the processes of search and discovery. In addition to remains, archaeologists are trained to look for objects contained in and around the excavation area. These objects can include anything from wedding rings to potentially probative evidence such as cigarette butts or shoe prints. Their training extends further to observing context, association and significance of objects in a crime scene and drawing conclusions that may be useful for locating a victim or suspect. A forensic archaeologist must also be able to utilize a degree of creativity and adaptability during times when crime scenes can not be excavated using traditional archaeological techniques. For example, one particular case study was conducted on the search and recovery of the remains of a missing girl who was found in a septic tank underground. This instance required unique methods unlike those of a typical archeological excavation in order to exhume and preserve the contents of the tank.

Forensic archaeologists are involved within three main areas. Assisting with crime scene research, investigation, and recovery of evidence and/or skeletal remains is only one aspect.

Processing scenes of mass fatality or incidents of terrorism (i.e. homicide, mass graves and war crimes, and other violations of human rights) is a branch of work that forensic archaeologists are involved with as well.

Forensic archaeologists can help determine potential grave sites that might have been overlooked. Differences in the soil can help forensic archaeologists locate these sites. During the burial of a body, a small mound of soil will form from the filling of the grave. The loose soil and increasing nutrients from the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas. Typically, grave sites will have looser, darker, more organic soil than areas around it. The search for additional grave sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and mass graves to search for additional burial locations.

One other discipline to the career of a forensic archaeologist is teaching and research. Educating law enforcement, crime scene technicians and investigators, as well as undergraduate and graduate students is a critical part of a forensic archaeologist&#x27;s career in order to spread knowledge of proper excavation techniques to other forensic personnel and to increase awareness of the field in general. Crime scene evidence in the past has been compromised due to improper excavation and recovery by untrained personnel. Forensic anthropologists are then unable to provide meaningful analyses on retrieved skeletal remains due to damage or contamination. Research conducted to improve archaeological field methods, particularly to advance nondestructive methods of search and recovery are also important for the advancement and recognition of the field.

There is an ethical component that must be considered. The capability to uncover information about victims of war crimes or homicide may present a conflict in cases that involve competing interests. Forensic archaeologists are often contracted to assist with the processing of mass graves by larger organisations that have motives related to exposure and prosecution rather than providing peace of mind to families and communities. These projects are at times opposed by smaller, human rights groups who wish to avoid overshadowing memories of the individuals with their violent manner(s) of death. In cases like these, forensic archaeologists must practice caution and recognize the implications behind their work and the information they uncover.

===Forensic taphonomy===
The examination of skeletal remains often takes into account environmental factors that affect decomposition. Forensic taphonomy is the study of these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. In order to study these effects, body farms have been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated cadavers. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing can have on a dumped body.

Forensic taphonomy is divided into two separate sections, biotaphonomy and geotaphonomy. Biotaphonomy is the study of how the environment affects the decomposition of the body. Specifically it is the examination of biological remains in order to ascertain how decomposition or destruction occurred. This can include factors such as animal scavenging, climate, as well as the size and age of the individual at the time of death. Biotaphonomy must also take into account common mortuary services such as embalming and their effects on decomposition.

Geotaphonomy is the examination of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially help determine the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton was a result of perimortem or postmortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.

==Education==
Individuals looking to become forensic anthropologists first obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree in anthropology from an accredited university. During their studies they should focus on physical anthropology as well as osteology. In addition it is recommended that individuals take courses in a wide range of sciences such as biology, chemistry, anatomy, and genetics.

Once undergraduate education is completed the individual should proceed to graduate level courses. Typically, forensic anthropologists obtain doctorates in physical anthropology and have completed coursework in osteology, forensics, and archaeology. It is also recommended that individuals looking to pursue a forensic anthropology profession get experience in dissection usually through a gross anatomy class as well as useful internships with investigative agencies or practicing anthropologists. Once educational requirements are complete one can become certified by the forensic anthropology society in the region. This can include the IALM exam given by the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe or the certification exam given by the American Board of Forensic Anthropology.

Typically, most forensic anthropologists perform forensic casework on a part-time basis, however there are individuals who work in the field full-time usually with federal or international agencies. Forensic anthropologists are usually employed in academia either at a university or a research facility.
==Ethics==
Like other forensic fields, forensic anthropologists are held to a high level of ethical standards due to their work in the legal system. Individuals who purposefully misrepresent themselves or any piece of evidence can be sanctioned, fined, or imprisoned by the appropriate authorities depending on the severity of the violation. Individuals who fail to disclose any conflict of interests or who fail to report all of their findings, regardless of what they may be, can face disciplinary actions. It is important that forensic anthropologists remain impartial during the course of an investigation. Any perceived bias during an investigation could hamper efforts in court to bring the responsible parties to justice. There is a substantial risk of confirmation bias from knowledge of context, especially with more ambiguous or complex cases.

In addition to the evidentiary guidelines forensic anthropologists should always keep in mind that the remains they are working with were once a person. If possible, local customs regarding dealing with the dead should be observed and all remains should be treated with respect and dignity.

<doc id="379051" wikidata="Q1082992" url="?curid=379051" title="Equivalence of categories">
<text>In category theory, a branch of abstract mathematics, an equivalence of categories is a relation between two categories that establishes that these categories are &quot;essentially the same&quot;. There are numerous examples of categorical equivalences from many areas of mathematics. Establishing an equivalence involves demonstrating strong similarities between the mathematical structures concerned. In some cases, these structures may appear to be unrelated at a superficial or intuitive level, making the notion fairly powerful: it creates the opportunity to &quot;translate&quot; theorems between different kinds of mathematical structures, knowing that the essential meaning of those theorems is preserved under the translation.

If a category is equivalent to the opposite (or dual) of another category then one speaks of
a duality of categories, and says that the two categories are dually equivalent.

An equivalence of categories consists of a functor between the involved categories, which is required to have an &quot;inverse&quot; functor. However, in contrast to the situation common for isomorphisms in an algebraic setting, the composite of the functor and its &quot;inverse&quot; is not necessarily the identity mapping. Instead it is sufficient that each object be &quot;naturally isomorphic&quot; to its image under this composition. Thus one may describe the functors as being &quot;inverse up to isomorphism&quot;. There is indeed a concept of isomorphism of categories where a strict form of inverse functor is required, but this is of much less practical use than the &quot;equivalence&quot; concept.

==Definition==
Formally, given two categories &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;, an &quot;equivalence of categories&quot; consists of a functor &quot;F&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot;, a functor &quot;G&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;C&quot;, and two natural isomorphisms ε: &quot;FG&quot;→I&quot;D&quot; and η : I&quot;C&quot;→&quot;GF&quot;. Here &quot;FG&quot;: &quot;D&quot;→&quot;D&quot; and &quot;GF&quot;: &quot;C&quot;→&quot;C&quot; denote the respective compositions of &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, and I&quot;C&quot;: &quot;C&quot;→&quot;C&quot; and I&quot;D&quot;: &quot;D&quot;→&quot;D&quot; denote the &quot;identity functors&quot; on &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;, assigning each object and morphism to itself. If &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are contravariant functors one speaks of a &quot;duality of categories&quot; instead.

One often does not specify all the above data. For instance, we say that the categories &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are &quot;equivalent&quot; (respectively &quot;dually equivalent&quot;) if there exists an equivalence (respectively duality) between them. Furthermore, we say that &quot;F&quot; &quot;is&quot; an equivalence of categories if an inverse functor &quot;G&quot; and natural isomorphisms as above exist. Note however that knowledge of &quot;F&quot; is usually not enough to reconstruct &quot;G&quot; and the natural isomorphisms: there may be many choices (see example below).

==Alternative characterizations==
A functor &quot;F&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; yields an equivalence of categories if and only if it is simultaneously:
* full, i.e. for any two objects &quot;c&quot;1 and &quot;c&quot;2 of &quot;C&quot;, the map Hom&quot;C&quot;(&quot;c&quot;1,&quot;c&quot;2) → Hom&quot;D&quot;(&quot;Fc&quot;1,&quot;Fc&quot;2) induced by &quot;F&quot; is surjective;
* faithful, i.e. for any two objects &quot;c&quot;1 and &quot;c&quot;2 of &quot;C&quot;, the map Hom&quot;C&quot;(&quot;c&quot;1,&quot;c&quot;2) → Hom&quot;D&quot;(&quot;Fc&quot;1,&quot;Fc&quot;2) induced by &quot;F&quot; is injective; and
* essentially surjective (dense), i.e. each object &quot;d&quot; in &quot;D&quot; is isomorphic to an object of the form &quot;Fc&quot;, for &quot;c&quot; in &quot;C&quot;.
This is a quite useful and commonly applied criterion, because one does not have to explicitly construct the &quot;inverse&quot; &quot;G&quot; and the natural isomorphisms between &quot;FG&quot;, &quot;GF&quot; and the identity functors. On the other hand, though the above properties guarantee the &quot;existence&quot; of a categorical equivalence (given a sufficiently strong version of the axiom of choice in the underlying set theory), the missing data is not completely specified, and often there are many choices. It is a good idea to specify the missing constructions explicitly whenever possible.
Due to this circumstance, a functor with these properties is sometimes called a weak equivalence of categories. (Unfortunately this conflicts with terminology from homotopy theory.)

There is also a close relation to the concept of adjoint functors formula_1, where we say that formula_2 is the left adjoint of formula_3, or likewise, &quot;G&quot; is the right adjoint of &quot;F&quot;. Then &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are equivalent (as defined above in that there are natural isomorphisms from &quot;FG&quot; to I&quot;D&quot; and I&quot;C&quot; to &quot;GF&quot;) if and only if formula_1 and both &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are full and faithful.

When adjoint functors formula_1 are not both full and faithful, then we may view their adjointness relation as expressing a &quot;weaker form of equivalence&quot; of categories. Assuming that the natural transformations for the adjunctions are given, all of these formulations allow for an explicit construction of the necessary data, and no choice principles are needed. The key property that one has to prove here is that the &quot;counit&quot; of an adjunction is an isomorphism if and only if the right adjoint is a full and faithful functor.

==Examples==
* Consider the category formula_6 having a single object formula_7 and a single morphism formula_8, and the category formula_9 with two objects formula_10, formula_11 and four morphisms: two identity morphisms formula_12, formula_13 and two isomorphisms formula_14 and formula_15. The categories formula_6 and formula_9 are equivalent; we can (for example) have formula_18 map formula_7 to formula_10 and formula_21 map both objects of formula_9 to formula_7 and all morphisms to formula_8.
* By contrast, the category formula_6 with a single object and a single morphism is &quot;not&quot; equivalent to the category formula_26 with two objects and only two identity morphisms. The two objects in formula_26 are &quot;not&quot; isomorphic in that there are no morphisms between them. Thus any functor from formula_6 to formula_26 will not be essentially surjective.
* Consider a category formula_6 with one object formula_7, and two morphisms formula_32. Let formula_8 be the identity morphism on formula_7 and set formula_35. Of course, formula_6 is equivalent to itself, which can be shown by taking formula_8 in place of the required natural isomorphisms between the functor formula_38 and itself. However, it is also true that formula_39 yields a natural isomorphism from formula_38 to itself. Hence, given the information that the identity functors form an equivalence of categories, in this example one still can choose between two natural isomorphisms for each direction.
* The category of sets and partial functions is equivalent to but not isomorphic with the category of pointed sets and point-preserving maps.
* Consider the category formula_6 of finite-dimensional real vector spaces, and the category formula_42 of all real matrices (the latter category is explained in the article on additive categories). Then formula_6 and formula_9 are equivalent: The functor formula_45 which maps the object formula_46 of formula_9 to the vector space formula_48 and the matrices in formula_9 to the corresponding linear maps is full, faithful and essentially surjective.
* One of the central themes of algebraic geometry is the duality of the category of affine schemes and the category of commutative rings. The functor formula_21 associates to every commutative ring its spectrum, the scheme defined by the prime ideals of the ring. Its adjoint formula_18 associates to every affine scheme its ring of global sections.
* In functional analysis the category of commutative C*-algebras with identity is contravariantly equivalent to the category of compact Hausdorff spaces. Under this duality, every compact Hausdorff space formula_52 is associated with the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on formula_52, and every commutative C*-algebra is associated with the space of its maximal ideals. This is the Gelfand representation.
* In lattice theory, there are a number of dualities, based on representation theorems that connect certain classes of lattices to classes of topological spaces. Probably the most well-known theorem of this kind is &quot;Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for Boolean algebras&quot;, which is a special instance within the general scheme of &quot;Stone duality&quot;. Each Boolean algebra formula_54 is mapped to a specific topology on the set of ultrafilters of formula_54. Conversely, for any topology the clopen (i.e. closed and open) subsets yield a Boolean algebra. One obtains a duality between the category of Boolean algebras (with their homomorphisms) and Stone spaces (with continuous mappings). Another case of Stone duality is Birkhoff&#x27;s representation theorem stating a duality between finite partial orders and finite distributive lattices.
* In pointless topology the category of spatial locales is known to be equivalent to the dual of the category of sober spaces.
* For two rings &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;, the product category &quot;R&quot;-Mod×&quot;S&quot;-Mod is equivalent to (&quot;R&quot;×&quot;S&quot;)-Mod.
* Any category is equivalent to its skeleton.

==Properties==
As a rule of thumb, an equivalence of categories preserves all &quot;categorical&quot; concepts and properties. If &quot;F&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; is an equivalence, then the following statements are all true:
* the object &quot;c&quot; of &quot;C&quot; is an initial object (or terminal object, or zero object), if and only if &quot;Fc&quot; is an initial object (or terminal object, or zero object) of &quot;D&quot;
* the morphism α in &quot;C&quot; is a monomorphism (or epimorphism, or isomorphism), if and only if &quot;Fα&quot; is a monomorphism (or epimorphism, or isomorphism) in &quot;D&quot;.
* the functor &quot;H&quot; : &quot;I&quot; → &quot;C&quot; has limit (or colimit) &quot;l&quot; if and only if the functor &quot;FH&quot; : &quot;I&quot; → &quot;D&quot; has limit (or colimit) &quot;Fl&quot;. This can be applied to equalizers, products and coproducts among others. Applying it to kernels and cokernels, we see that the equivalence &quot;F&quot; is an exact functor.
* &quot;C&quot; is a cartesian closed category (or a topos) if and only if &quot;D&quot; is cartesian closed (or a topos).

Dualities &quot;turn all concepts around&quot;: they turn initial objects into terminal objects, monomorphisms into epimorphisms, kernels into cokernels, limits into colimits etc.

If &quot;F&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; is an equivalence of categories, and &quot;G&quot;1 and &quot;G&quot;2 are two inverses of &quot;F&quot;, then &quot;G&quot;1 and &quot;G&quot;2 are naturally isomorphic.

If &quot;F&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; is an equivalence of categories, and if &quot;C&quot; is a preadditive category (or additive category, or abelian category), then &quot;D&quot; may be turned into a preadditive category (or additive category, or abelian category) in such a way that &quot;F&quot; becomes an additive functor. On the other hand, any equivalence between additive categories is necessarily additive. (Note that the latter statement is not true for equivalences between preadditive categories.)

An auto-equivalence of a category &quot;C&quot; is an equivalence &quot;F&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;C&quot;. The auto-equivalences of &quot;C&quot; form a group under composition if we consider two auto-equivalences that are naturally isomorphic to be identical. This group captures the essential &quot;symmetries&quot; of &quot;C&quot;. (One caveat: if &quot;C&quot; is not a small category, then the auto-equivalences of &quot;C&quot; may form a proper class rather than a set.)

<text>Bertrand of Toulouse (or Bertrand of Tripoli) (died 1112) was count of Toulouse, and was the first count of Tripoli to rule in Tripoli itself.

Bertrand was the eldest son of Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, and had ruled Toulouse since Raymond left on the First Crusade in 1095. He was, between 1098 and 1100, dispossessed by his cousin Philippa, Countess of Toulouse and her husband William IX, Duke of Aquitaine, who marched into Toulouse and captured it. They mortgaged it back later to Bertrand in 1100 to fund Duke William&#x27;s expedition to the Holy Land. Bertrand officially became count of Toulouse when Raymond died in 1105, and in 1108 he travelled to Tripoli to take control there as well. 

Bertrand deposed Raymond&#x27;s nephew William II Jordan  as nominal count of Tripoli in 1109, and with Baldwin I of Jerusalem of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and a fleet of Genoese ships, he captured Tripoli on 12 July.

Bertrand married Helie of Burgundy, daughter of Eudes I, in June 1095.

Bertrand ruled in Tripoli until his death in 1112. He was succeeded by his son Pons in the County of Tripoli, and by his brother Alfonso Jordan in the County of Toulouse - although Toulouse was at that point again lost to Philippa and William.

<text>The Raphael Cartoons are seven large cartoons for tapestries, surviving from a set of ten cartoons, designed by the High Renaissance painter Raphael in 1515–1516. Commissioned by Pope Leo X for the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican Palace, the tapestries show scenes from the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles and are hung (on special occasions) below the frescoes of the &quot;Life of Moses&quot; and the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV. The cartoons belong to the British Royal Collection but have been on loan to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London since 1865.

The tapestries rivalled Michelangelo&#x27;s ceiling as the most famous and influential designs of the Renaissance, and were well known to all artists of the Renaissance and Baroque through reproduction in the form of prints. Admiration of them reached its highest pitch in the 18th and 19th centuries; they were described as &quot;the Parthenon sculptures of modern art&quot;.

==Commission and the tapestries==
Raphael was highly conscious that his work would be seen beneath the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which had been finished by Michelangelo only two years before, and took great care perfecting his designs, which are among his largest and most complicated. Originally the set was intended to include 16 tapestries. Raphael was paid twice by Leo, in June 1515 and December 1516, the last payment apparently being upon completion of the work. Tapestries retained their Late Gothic prestige during the Renaissance. Raphael was paid a total of 1,000 ducats. Most of the expense was in the manufacture, with the creation of the tapestries in Brussels costing 15,000 ducats.

Raphael knew that the final product of his work would be produced by craftsmen rendering his design in another medium; his efforts are therefore entirely concentrated on strong compositions and broad effects, rather than felicitous handling or detail. It was partly this that made the designs so effective when later reproduced in reduced print versions.
The cartoons are painted in a glue distemper medium on many sheets of paper glued together (as can be seen in the full-size illustrations). They are now mounted on a canvas backing and are in general in very good condition apart from some fading of the colours.

The cartoons are all slightly over 3 m (9 feet 10 inches) tall, and from 3 to 5 m (9 feet 10 inches to 16 feet 5 inches) wide, with the figures being over-lifesize. The cartoons are mirror-images of the finished tapestries, which were worked from behind. Raphael&#x27;s workshop would have assisted in the completion of the cartoons which were finished with great care. The cartoons show a much greater range of colours and more subtle gradation than could be reproduced in a tapestry. Some small preparatory drawings also survive: one for &quot;The Conversion of the Proconsul&quot; is also in the Royal Collection, and the Getty Museum in Malibu has a figure study of &quot;St Paul Rending His Garments&quot;. There would have been other drawings for all the subjects, which have been lost; it was from these that the first prints were made.

The tapestries had very wide and elaborate borders, also designed by Raphael, which these cartoons omit; presumably they had their own cartoons. Some of the side borders are separate pieces. The borders included ornamentation in an imitation of Ancient Roman relief sculpture and carved porphyry, as well as scenes from the life of Leo. They were themselves very influential, and sometimes used for other tapestries.

The cartoons were probably completed in 1516 and were then sent to Brussels, where the Vatican tapestries were woven by the workshop of Pieter van Aelst. 
The first delivery was in 1517, and seven were displayed in the chapel for Christmas Day in 1519 (then as now, their display was reserved for special occasions).

The tapestries were partly destroyed in the Sack of Rome in 1527. As they were made with both gold and silver thread, some were burnt by soldiers during the attack to extract the precious metals. The Vatican Museums have acquired tapestries and recreated sections to complete a full set, now usually displayed in a gallery, but sometimes moved to the Sistine Chapel for special occasions. They were displayed in the chapel for a week in February 2020, to mark the 500th anniversary of Raphael&#x27;s death. Their layout around the chapel is a matter of discussion among scholars, as there is no record of what was originally intended.

The Raphael&#x27;s cartoons were revered by The Carracci, but the great period of their influence began with Nicolas Poussin, who borrowed heavily from them and &quot;indeed exaggerated Raphael&#x27;s style; or rather concentrated it, for he was working on a much smaller scale&quot;. Thereafter they remained the touchstone of one approach to history painting until at least the early 19th century – the Raphael whose influence the Pre-Raphaelites wanted to reject was perhaps above all the Raphael of the cartoons.

==Subjects==


The Raphael Cartoons represent scenes from the lives of Saints Peter and Paul. As was usual, the completed tapestries reverse are a mirror image of the cartoon designs. The programme emphasised a number of points relevant to contemporary controversies in the period just before the Protestant Reformation, but especially the entrusting of the Church to Saint Peter, the founder of the papacy. There were relatively few precedents for these subjects, so Raphael was less constrained by traditional iconographic expectations than he would have been with a series on the life of Christ or Mary. He no doubt received some advice or instructions in choosing the scenes to depict. The scenes from the &quot;Life of Peter&quot; were designed to hang below the frescoes of the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; by Perugino and others in the middle register of the chapel; opposite them, the &quot;Life of Saint Paul&quot; was to hang below the &quot;Life of Moses&quot; in fresco. An intervening small frieze showed subjects from the life of Leo, also designed to complement the other series. Each sequence begins at the altar wall, with the &quot;Life of Peter&quot; on the right side of the Chapel and &quot;Life of Paul&quot; on the left. Including the three subjects with no surviving cartoons, the set contains (the full scriptural quotations and a commentary are on the V&amp;A website):

=== Life of Peter ===
*&quot;The Miraculous Draught of Fishes&quot; (Luke 5:1–11)
*&quot;Christ&#x27;s Charge to Peter&quot; (Matthew 16:16–19) The key moment in the Gospels for the claims of the Papacy
*&quot;The Healing of the Lame Man&quot; (Acts 3:1–8)
*&quot;The Death of Ananias&quot; (Acts 5:1–10)

=== Life of Paul ===
*&quot;The Stoning of St Stephen&quot; (no cartoon) at which Paul (Saul) was present before his conversion.
*&quot;The Conversion of Saint Paul&quot; (no cartoon)
*&quot;The Conversion of the Proconsul&quot; or &quot;The Blinding of Elymas&quot; (Acts 13:6–12). Paul had been invited to preach to the Roman proconsul of Paphos, Sergius Paulus, but is heckled by Elymas, a &quot;magus&quot;, whom Paul miraculously causes to go temporarily blind, thus converting the proconsul.
*&quot;The Sacrifice at Lystra&quot; (Acts 14:8). After Paul miraculously cures a cripple, the people of Lystra see him and his companion Barnabas (both standing left) as gods, and want to make a sacrifice to them. Paul tears his garments in disgust, whilst Barnabas speaks to the crowd, persuading the young man at centre to restrain the man with the sacrificial axe.
*&quot;St Paul in prison&quot; (no cartoon), much smaller than the others, tall and narrow. This is also missing from the later tapestry sets.
*&quot;St Paul Preaching in Athens&quot; (Acts 17:16–34), the figure standing at the left in a red cap is a portrait of Leo; next to him is Janus Lascaris, a Greek scholar in Rome. The kneeling couple at the right were probably added by Giulio Romano, then an assistant to Raphael.

;The subjects missing from the cartoon set
== Tapestry Descriptions ==

=== The Miraculous Draught of Fishes (Luke 5:1–11) ===
This cartoon depicts Christ telling Peter and the Apostles where to cast their net. This resulted in the &quot;miraculous catch.&quot; Within the design, Peter is pictured bowing before Christ as if thanking him for the harvest full bounty that was caught. Raphael&#x27;s exquisite attention to details are shown in this tapestry in how there is a mirror image of the artwork reflected in the water. There is a great use of foreshortening.  His use of perspective in the distant background is used effectively. Raphael demonstrates an excellent use of tones in the forefront of the image.

=== Christ&#x27;s Charge to Peter (Matthew 16:16–19) ===
Within this tapestry Raphael combines the two Bible stories of Matthew 16:18–19. Raphael portrays Christ commanding Peter to share the Gospel for him. Christ points at Peter while simultaneously pointing at the sheep. This creates a connection for Peter. He is chosen as the shepherd for the believers. Raphael utilizes foreshortening to help viewers focus on the main images and message of the cartoon. He effortlessly implements chiaroscuro. The use of colors to show different lighting illustrates where the sun is in relation to the characters.

=== The Healing of the Lame Man (Acts 3:1–8) ===
The incredible story of Peter healing the lame man, Acts 3:1–8 is a tapestry within Raphael&#x27;s Cartoon collection. This miracle illustrates the &quot;spiritual healing of Jesus.&quot; Pictured is the lame man sitting and leaning against an intricately detailed column with his arm reaching overhead for Peter to cradle his hand. Raphael&#x27;s attention to detail is displayed in the lame man&#x27;s face. The shadowing and tones used create the look of an aged, tired man. The wrinkles in his face and his eyes display the pain he is feeling. The lines used in the creation of his legs and feet define muscular legs and impaired feet. All of this artistic detail reinforces the fact that the lame man spent many years lying and crawling on the ground impaired by his handicap. In contrast, Peter stands clutching his hand while praying over him. The details in Peter&#x27;s face and expression reinforce his concern. The rendering of the clothing is exceptional. It gives the appearance of creased material that can be felt. Furthermore, the detail of each individual&#x27;s hair enables the viewer to detect exactly how their hair would appear in person.

=== The Death of Ananias (Acts 5:1–10) ===
Raphael&#x27;s tapestry expertly illustrates the story of Acts 5:1–10. This could also be named the miracles of Peter. This artwork explains the story of how Peter is capable of punishing and saving others. The Apostles requested that the Christian followers sell their items and tithe the money. During this, Ananias steals from the church by stealing some of the money. When questioned by Peter, Ananias denies any wrongdoing. Ananias drops dead. He was punished for his sins of stealing and lying. Raphael once again applies the skill of chiaroscuro to illustrate this tapestry. His use of tones and shading help place lighting and shadows to specific areas of this artwork. The use of implied lines is demonstrated with the man standing over Ananias pointing to another individual who is pointing up, as if he is pointing to God. This implies that God can help him. The group of men on the right appears concerned with Ananias and wants to help. On the other hand, the men to the left seem frightened.

=== The Conversion of the Proconsul (Acts 13:6–12) ===
This tapestry depicts the story written in Acts 13:6–12. Elymas tries to keep Paul and Barnabas from converting others to Christianity. Elymas suffers temporary blindness for this action. Observing and experiencing this event, leads the proconsul to conversion. Paul&#x27;s overall goal to convert others to Christianity is illustrated through this tapestry. Raphael utilizes tone and shading to convey different levels of light. He has created a different colored robe for each man. This helps them stand out from the crowd.  The different amounts of coating, creates texture throughout the tapestry and images appear more lifelike.

=== The Sacrifice at Lystra (Acts 14:8) ===
Acts 14:8 influenced this tapestry. It represents the story of how Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for the Gods, Mercury and Jupiter, after Paul healed a lame man. The townspeople of Lystra wanted to offer sacrifices to them. Paul was dismayed and proceeded to convince the crowd that they were God&#x27;s messengers. The foremost character in this scene is a citizen ready to partake in the sacrifice. He wields an axe above his head ready to execute the ox. Raphael&#x27;s focus on this man&#x27;s face expresses his determination in the situation. Raphael&#x27;s use of line, shading and toning reveal his muscular form.

=== St Paul Preaching at Athens (Acts 17:16–34) ===
This tapestry illustrates the story written in Acts 17:16–34. It illustrates Paul preaching to Athens&#x27;s judicial council. Paul explains Christianity and the importance of knowing God. The viewer can feel Paul&#x27;s excitement of sharing his message. His arms are stretched out to the crowd, grabbing their attention and welcoming them into the message. Raphael&#x27;s detail on each individual&#x27;s face easily reveals their thoughts and feelings regarding Paul. Paul&#x27;s clothing and the council&#x27;s clothing include brightly colored robes gracefully wrapped around them. The lines, colors and shading used on the ground give the appearance of a cold marble floor.

==Further sets made in Brussels==
Cartoons were sometimes returned with tapestries to the commissioner, but this clearly did not happen here, perhaps because of the death of Leo. This allowed four other recorded sets to be made later in Brussels, all of nine tapestries, missing the small &quot;Saint Paul in Prison&quot;.

One set was bought by Henry VIII of England in 1542. These tapestries were at Westminster Abbey for the coronation of Elizabeth I, and on 14 February 1613 to decorate the chapel of Whitehall Palace for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V of the Palatinate. After being sold in 1649 in the dispersion of the collection of Charles I of England, eventually Henry&#x27;s set ended up in Berlin, where it was destroyed by a fire at the end of World War II.

King Francis I of France had another of similar date, now lost. The Ducal Palace, Mantua has a set, made in Brussels for Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga in the early 16th century, with the arms of Gonzaga in the borders. Dussler describes these as &quot;in better condition than the series in the Vatican&quot;. A set woven around 1550 that joined the Spanish royal collection some time in the following decades now belongs to the Patrimonio Nacional, and is usually hung in the Royal Palace, Madrid.

==In England==
The seven cartoons now in London were bought from a Genoese collection in 1623 by King Charles I of England, then still Prince of Wales, using agents. He paid only £300 for them, a price that suggests they were regarded as working designs rather than works of art in their own right. Charles had in fact intended to make further tapestries from them at the Mortlake Tapestry Works near London, which he did, with new baroque borders by their designer Francis Cleyn, paying £500 each, but was well aware of their artistic significance. They had been cut into long vertical strips a yard wide, as was required for use on low-warp tapestry looms, and were only permanently rejoined in the 1690s at Hampton Court. In Charles&#x27; day these were stored in wooden boxes in the Banqueting House, Whitehall. They were one of the few items in the Royal Collection withheld from sale by Oliver Cromwell after Charles&#x27; execution. The fate of the other three cartoons from the set is unknown; that for the &quot;Conversion of Saint Paul&quot; was recorded in the collection of Cardinal Grimani in Venice in 1521, and of his heir in 1526.

William III commissioned Sir Christopher Wren and William Talman to design the &quot;Cartoon Gallery&quot; at Hampton Court Palace in 1699, specially to contain them. By this date, the prestige of tapestries in general was beginning to wane, and those of the early sets that had survived were probably already rather faded and dirty. From this point on, the cartoons became regarded as the most authentic and attractive expression of Raphael&#x27;s conceptions. European taste had also moved in their favour; their dignified classicism was very much in tune with a movement away from the more frenzied versions of the Baroque. The fame of the cartoons, as opposed to the designs in general, grew rapidly.

In 1763, when George III moved them to the newly bought Buckingham House (now Buckingham Palace) there were protests in Parliament by John Wilkes and others, as they would no longer be accessible to the public (Hampton Court had long been open to visitors). They had been greatly studied by artists and cognoscenti alike whilst at Hampton Court, and played a crucial role in forming English expectations of a monumental style of painting; one of the great preoccupations of English art in the 18th century. These were often mentioned in the &quot;Discourses&quot; of Sir Joshua Reynolds, the dominant English critical work on art of the century. Having explained that &quot;The principal works of modern art are in fresco&quot; he specifically adds the cartoons &quot;which, though not strictly to be called fresco, yet may be put under that denomination&quot; before claiming that &quot;Raffaelle ... stands in general foremost of the first painters...&quot; (i.e. the best painters) and comparing Raphael&#x27;s works in oil unfavourably to his frescoes.

In 1804 they were returned to Hampton Court, where in 1858 they were photographed for the first time by Charles Thompson Thurston, having been taken out into the courtyard and placed upside down on special scaffolding. In 1865 Queen Victoria decided that the cartoons should be exhibited on loan at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, where they are still to be seen in a specially designed gallery. There are also copies at many locations, including Knole House and Hampton Court Palace, where the copies painted in the 1690s by an artist named Henry Cooke are displayed in the Cartoon Gallery. The Royal Collection also has a set of the tapestries. A set of copies painted by Sir James Thornhill have been owned by Columbia University since 1959, and another is in the Royal Academy.

Several other sets were made in Mortlake; Cleyn had made copies of the designs, and these were used. Charles I&#x27;s set was bought by Cardinal Mazarin, and now belongs to the French government. Forde Abbey, Chatsworth House, the Duke of Buccleuch and others have sets. A set of six tapestries is now in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden, and the Ducal Palace, Urbino displays a set.

==Prints after the designs==

In the early 16th century many Italian artists learnt the lesson of the huge, and very rapid, international prestige that Albrecht Dürer had gained through his prints, and set out to emulate him. Raphael had no knowledge of printmaking himself, and was probably too busy to want to learn the techniques, but he was the most successful of the Italians in spreading his fame through prints, through his much debated relationship with the engraver Marcantonio Raimondi and his workshop. Raphael made many drawings solely as designs for prints, and the workshop made a large number of prints, apparently working always from drawings rather than the finished work, of Raphael&#x27;s paintings in the Vatican and elsewhere; the tapestry designs were no exception. These prints themselves were very widely copied by other printmakers, and spread rapidly through Europe.
The earliest datable print after one of the designs is an engraving of 1516 by Agostino Veneziano, then working in the workshop of Marcantonio Raimondi, of the &quot;Death of Ananias&quot;. This was probably made even before that tapestry was woven. The composition is in the same direction as the tapestry, but since the printmaking process would also reverse the direction of the composition, this almost certainly means it was deliberately reversed compared to the detailed preparatory drawing in the Royal Collection on which it was based (see above; the two agree in all details), probably by taking a counterprint from the chalk drawing. All Raimondi and Veneziano&#x27;s prints of Raphael&#x27;s designs in Raphael&#x27;s lifetime were based on drawings, according to both Landau and Pons. Raimondi himself engraved one of the set, which were presumably all produced around 1516, so that even many in the Roman art world may have seen prints of the designs before they saw the tapestries themselves. 
Agostino&#x27;s engraving was rapidly copied in another well-known version, a four-colour chiaroscuro woodcut by Ugo da Carpi, dated 1518. The da Carpi woodcut is often cited in studies of the complex question of early image copyright, as it bears (in its first state) a Latin inscription beneath the image claiming &quot;copyright&quot;-style privileges from both the Venetian Republic and the Papacy (covering the Papal States) and threatening excommunication for anyone breaching the latter. Apart from other straightforward copies of the prints from the Raimondi set, Parmigianino did a typically individual print version of one design from the set in about 1530.

A later large set of engravings by Matthaeus Merian the Elder illustrating the Bible, from around the end of the century, used some of the compositions, slightly increasing the height, and elaborating them. These were much used and copied in popular books, further widening the knowledge of the designs to a much larger audience.

After the cartoons were reassembled at the end of the 17th century, by which time printmakers were well accustomed to copying direct from large paintings, they became the dominant source of new print copies. By the 18th century many different print versions were in circulation, of varying faithfulness and quality.

<text>The Vienna State Opera (, ) is a historic opera house and opera company based in Vienna, Austria. The 1,709-seat Renaissance Revival venue was the first major building on the Vienna Ring Road. It was built from 1861 to 1869 following plans by August Sicard von Sicardsburg and Eduard van der Nüll, and designs by Josef Hlávka. The opera house was inaugurated as the &quot;Vienna Court Opera&quot; (&quot;Wiener Hofoper&quot;) in the presence of Emperor Franz Joseph I and Empress Elisabeth of Austria. It became known by its current name after the establishment of the First Austrian Republic in 1921. The Vienna State Opera is the successor of the old Vienna Court Opera (built in 1636 inside the Hofburg). The new site was chosen and the construction paid by Emperor Franz Joseph in 1861.

The members of the Vienna Philharmonic are recruited from the Vienna State Opera&#x27;s orchestra. The building is also the home of the Vienna State Ballet, and it hosts the annual Vienna Opera Ball during the carnival season.

==History==
===History of the building===
====Construction====
The opera house was the first major building on the Vienna Ringstrasse commissioned by the Viennese &quot;city expansion fund&quot;. Work commenced on the house in 1861 and was completed in 1869, following plans drawn up by architects August Sicard von Sicardsburg and Eduard van der Nüll. It was built in the Neo-Renaissance style by the Czech architect and contractor Josef Hlávka.


The Ministry of the Interior had commissioned a number of reports into the availability of certain building materials, with the result that stones long not seen in Vienna were used, such as Wöllersdorfer Stein, for plinths and free-standing, simply-divided buttresses, the famously hard stone from Kaisersteinbruch, whose colour was more appropriate than that of Kelheimerstein, for more lushly decorated parts. The somewhat coarser-grained Kelheimerstein (also known as Solnhof Plattenstein) was intended as the main stone to be used in the building of the opera house, but the necessary quantity was not deliverable. Breitenbrunner stone was suggested as a substitute for the Kelheimer stone, and stone from Jois was used as a cheaper alternative to the Kaiserstein. The staircases were constructed from polished Kaiserstein, while most of the rest of the interior was decorated with varieties of marble.

The decision was made to use dimension stone for the exterior of the building. Due to the monumental demand for stone, stone from Sóskút, widely used in Budapest, was also used. Three Viennese masonry companies were employed to supply enough masonry labour: Eduard Hauser (still in existence today), Anton Wasserburger and Moritz Pranter. The foundation stone was laid on 20 May 1863.

====Public response====
The building, however, was not particularly well-received by the public. For one, it lacked the grandeur of the Heinrichshof, a private residence destroyed during World War II and later replaced in 1955 by the Opernringhof. Additionally, the opera house’s construction was overshadowed by an unexpected issue: the level of the Ringstraße in front of the building was raised by a metre after construction had already commenced, the latter was likened to &quot;a sunken treasure chest&quot; and, in analogy to the military disaster of 1866 (the Battle of Königgrätz), was deprecatingly referred to as &quot;the &#x27;Königgrätz&#x27; of architecture&quot;. Eduard van der Nüll committed suicide, and barely ten weeks later Sicardsburg died from tuberculosis so neither architect saw the completion of the building. The opening premiere was &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, by Mozart, on 25 May 1869. Emperor Franz Josef and Empress Elisabeth (Sissi) were present.

====WW II bombing and redesign====
Towards the end of World War II, on 12 March 1945, the opera was set alight by an American bombardment. The auditorium and stage were destroyed by flames, as well as almost the entire décor and props for more than 120 operas with around 150,000 costumes. The front section, which had been walled off as a precaution, however, remained intact including the foyer, with frescoes by Moritz von Schwind, the main stairways, the vestibule and the tea room. The State Opera was temporarily housed at the Theater an der Wien and at the Vienna Volksoper.

Lengthy discussion took place about whether the opera house should be restored to its original state on its original site, or whether it should be completely demolished and rebuilt, either on the same location or on a different site. Eventually the decision was made to rebuild the opera house as it had been, and the main restoration experts involved were Ernst Kolb (1948–1952) and Udo Illig (1953–1956).

The Austrian Federal Chancellor Leopold Figl made the decision in 1946 to have a functioning opera house again by 1949. An architectural competition was announced, which was won by Erich Boltenstern. The submissions had ranged from a complete restructuring of the auditorium to a replica of the original design; Boltenstern decided on a design similar to the original with some modernisation in keeping with the design of the 1950s. In order to achieve good acoustics, wood was the favoured building material, on the advice of, among others, Arturo Toscanini. In addition, the number of seats in the parterre (stalls) was reduced, and the fourth gallery, which had been fitted with columns, was restructured so as not to need columns. The façade, entrance hall and the &quot;Schwind&quot; foyer were restored and remain in their original style.

In the meantime, the opera company, which had at first been performing in the Volksoper, had moved rehearsals and performances to Theater an der Wien, where, on 1 May 1945, after the liberation and re-independence of Austria from the Nazis, the first performances were given. In 1947, the company went on tour to London.

Due to the appalling conditions at Theater an der Wien, the opera company leadership tried to raise significant quantities of money to speed up reconstruction of the original opera house. Many private donations were made, as well as donations of building material from the Soviets, who were very interested in the rebuilding of the opera. The mayor of Vienna had receptacles placed in many sites around Vienna for people to donate coins only. In this way, everyone in Vienna could say they had participated in the reconstruction and feel pride in considering themselves part owners.

However, in 1949, there was only a temporary roof on the Staatsoper, as construction work continued. It was not until 5 November 1955, after the Austrian State Treaty, that the Staatsoper could be reopened with a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, conducted by Karl Böhm. The American Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, was present. The state broadcaster ORF used the occasion to make its first live broadcast, at a time when there were only c. 800 televiewers in the whole of Austria. The new auditorium had a reduced capacity of about 2,276, including 567 standing room places. The ensemble, which had remained unified until the opening, crumbled in the following years, and slowly an international ensemble formed.

===History of the Company After the Second World War ===
In 1945, the Wiener Mozart-Ensemble was formed, which put on guest performances and became known particularly for its singing and playing culture. The Austrian conductor Josef Krips was the founder and mentor, who had only survived the Nazi era (given his Jewish heritage) thanks to luck and help from colleagues. At the end of the war, Krips started the renovation of the Staatoper, and was able to implement his aesthetic principles, including the departure from the Romantic Mozart ideal with a voluminous orchestral sound. Instead, qualities more associated with chamber music were featured, as well as a clearer, lighter sound, which would later come to be known as &quot;typically Viennese&quot;. Singers who worked with Krips during this time were Erich Kunz, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Wilma Lipp, among others.

As early as 1947, the Mozart-Ensemble was playing guest performances at the Royal Opera House in London, with Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. Richard Tauber, who had fled from the Nazis, sang &quot;Don Ottavio&quot;; three months later he died, and was remembered for singing with &quot;half a lung&quot; in order to fulfil his dream, many other artists became associated with the Mozart-Ensemble, for example Karl Böhm, but their role was still greatly peripheral, in a straightforward or assisting role. This was the beginning of Krips&#x27; worldwide career, which would take him to the most prominent houses in the world. Until his death in 1974, Krips was regarded as one of the most important &quot;Maestri&quot; (conductors/music directors) of the Staatsoper.

On 1 July 1998, a historical broadcast took place, as Austria undertook its first presidency of the European Union. &quot;Fidelio&quot; was broadcast live from the Vienna State Opera to the 15 capital cities of the EU.

== Today ==
=== The company ===
The Vienna State Opera is closely linked to the Vienna Philharmonic, which is an incorporated society of its own, but whose members are recruited from the orchestra of the Vienna State Opera.

The is one of the busiest opera houses in the world producing 50 to 60 operas in a repertory system per year and ten ballet productions in more than 350 performances. It is quite common to find a different opera being produced each day of a week. The employs over 1000 people. As of 2008, the annual operating budget of the was 100 million euros with slightly more than 50% as a state subsidy.
The company&#x27;s 2019 production of Olga Neuwirth&#x27;s opera &quot;Orlando&quot; marked the first production of an opera by a female composer in the history of the Vienna State Opera.

===Gustav Mahler===
Gustav Mahler was one of the many conductors who have worked in Vienna. During his tenure (1897–1907), Mahler cultivated a new generation of singers, such as Anna Bahr-Mildenburg and Selma Kurz, and recruited a stage designer who replaced the lavish historical stage decors with sparse stage scenery corresponding to modernistic, Jugendstil tastes. Mahler also introduced the practice of dimming the lighting in the theatre during performances, which was initially not appreciated by the audience. However, Mahler&#x27;s reforms were maintained by his successors.

===Herbert von Karajan===

Herbert von Karajan introduced the practice of performing operas exclusively in their original language instead of being translated into German. He also strengthened the ensemble and regular principal singers and introduced the policy of predominantly engaging guest singers. He began a collaboration with La Scala in Milan, in which both productions and orchestrations were shared. This created an opening for the prominent members of the Viennese ensemble to appear in Milan, especially to perform works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Richard Strauss.

===Ballet companies merge===
At the beginning of the 2005–2006 season, the ballet companies of the Staatsoper and the Vienna Volksoper were merged under the direction of Gyula Harangozó, which led to a reduction in the number of performers in the resulting ensemble. This has resulted in an increase in the number of guest stars engaged to work in the ballet. The practice of combining the two ballet companies proved an artistic failure, and Harangozó left when his contract expired in 2010.

From the 2010–2011 season a new company was formed called &quot;Wiener Staatsballet&quot;, Vienna State Ballet, under the direction of former Paris Opera Ballet principal dancer Manuel Legris. Legris eliminated Harangozós&#x27;s policy of presenting nothing but traditional narrative ballets with guest artists in the leading roles, concentrated on establishing a strong in-house ensemble and restored evenings of mixed bill programs, featuring works of George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, Jiří Kylián, William Forsythe, and many contemporary choreographers, as well as a reduced schedule of the classic ballets.

===140th anniversary season===
2009 marked the 140th anniversary of the Vienna Opera House. To celebrate this milestone an idea designed to reach out and embrace a new audience was conceived. A giant 50 sqm screen was placed on the side of the opera house facing Kärntner Straße. In four months live broadcasts of over 60 famous operas were transmitted in this way, including performances of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. This successful venture brought a new wave of operatic excitement to the many tourists and locals who experienced this cultural event. During daytime the screen displays a replica of the Opera House&#x27;s façade, as it obstructs a considerable part of the building, along with information about upcoming performances.

=== The opera house and children ===
The Vienna State Opera is particularly open to children: under Holender&#x27;s direction (he has three children of his own), the opera house has become well known for its children&#x27;s productions, which are performed in a tent on the roof of the Staatsoper. Recent examples include &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Dream Gobbler&quot;), &quot;Der 35. Mai&quot; (&quot;The 35th of May&quot;), C. F. E. Horneman&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Bastien und Bastienne&quot; and &quot;Wagners Nibelungenring für Kinder&quot; (&quot;Wagner&#x27;s Ring for children&quot;). In addition to this, there is a production of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; every year for 9- and 10-year-olds, decorated like the Opernball.

The opera house also has an opera school for boys and girls between the ages of eight and fourteen, which takes place in the afternoons after regular school. The children are introduced to music theatre and the prospect of becoming opera singers. The company recruits singers for children&#x27;s roles in its productions from this opera school. Twice every season there is a special matinée performance of the opera school. In 2006, the 250th anniversary of Mozart&#x27;s birth, they performed a 20-minute miniature opera &quot;Der kleine Friedrich&quot; arranged from songs of Mozart by Janko Kastelic and Claudia Toman.

=== &quot;Standing room only&quot; audience ===

Eighty minutes before each performance, cheap standing room tickets are sold (). These are popular with all age groups, and now have an almost legendary regular clientele, which is merciless in showing its displeasure with a performance loudly and unambiguously, but is even louder in voicing approval.

=== &quot;Der Neue Merker&quot; ===

Every performance at the Vienna State Opera is reviewed by an independent company in the opera publication &quot;Der Neue Merker&quot; (&quot;The New Judge&quot;) which is printed in about 2000 copies. This is unusual in that most opera magazines prefer to concentrate on new productions and premieres. There is an online version parallel to the publication, which receives (as of March 2007) an average of 10,000 visitors a week, and therefore is one of the most successful German-language opera portals.

=== Opera ball ===

For many decades, the opera house has been the venue of the Vienna Opera Ball. It is an event, which takes place annually on the last Thursday in Fasching. Those in attendance often include visitors from around the world, especially prominent names in business and politics. The opera ball receives media coverage from a range of outlets.

The opera ball in 1968 was the occasion for a protest, at which the organisation was criticised for being &quot;elite&quot; (due to the high prices), &quot;conceited&quot; (due to the opulent display of wealth for the newspapers and cameras) and &quot;reactionary&quot; (for upholding an allegedly outdated culture). There was violence between the demonstrators and the police.

=== Safety curtain ===
&quot;Safety Curtain&quot; is an exhibition series conceived by the non-profit art initiative museum in progress, which has been transforming the safety curtain of the Vienna State Opera into a temporary exhibition space for contemporary art since 1998. A jury (Daniel Birnbaum and Hans-Ulrich Obrist) selects the artists whose works are attached to the safety curtain by means of magnets and are shown during the course of a season. Artists up to date: Pierre Alechinsky, Tauba Auerbach, John Baldessari, Matthew Barney, Thomas Bayrle, Tacita Dean, Cerith Wyn Evans, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Richard Hamilton, David Hockney, Christine &amp; Irene Hohenbüchler, Joan Jonas, Martha Jungwirth, Jeff Koons, Maria Lassnig, Oswald Oberhuber, Giulio Paolini, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Rosemarie Trockel, Cy Twombly, Kara Walker, Carrie Mae Weems and Franz West.

<text>Verwood is a town and civil parish in eastern Dorset, England. The town lies north of Bournemouth and north east of Poole as the crow flies. The civil parish comprises the town of Verwood together with the extended village of Three Legged Cross, and in 2014 had a population of 15,170 (according to Dorset County Council). Verwood is the largest town in Dorset without an upper school.

==History==

===Early history===
Verwood was originally recorded as &quot;Beau Bois&quot; (Norman French: &quot;beautiful wood&quot;) in 1288, and it was not until 1329 that it got the name &quot;Verwood&quot;, which developed from &quot;Fairwood&quot; or &quot;The Fayrewood&quot;. Verwood is recorded as &quot;Fairwod&quot; (1329) and as &quot;Fayrwod&quot; (1436); this name has the meaning &quot;fair wood&quot; and the modern form shows the change of initial &quot;f&quot; to &quot;v&quot; characteristic of many Southwestern English dialects.

===Pottery industry===
The East Dorset pottery industry, known collectively as Verwood Pottery, thrived from early times on the clay soils of the neighbourhood which had ample firing material close at hand. The major production was of domestic earthenware although finer and more unusual pieces have been found from earlier times. In the latter days ornamental and novelty items were produced.

Until the end of their useful life, the methods of production had not varied from Roman times, all the processes being carried out with no mechanisation or electrification. For example, the clay was always trodden by foot and not mixed in a pug mill. The wheel was turned by an assistant with a pole or handle, and the kilns were wood-fired. For these reasons the Crossroads Pottery, then the last remaining in the area, attracted national and local newspaper attention in the early to mid-20th century.

The industry was not confined to a local sales base. Hawkers, or &quot;higglers&quot;, took the wares for sale over a wide area of southern England. They were also exported abroad, especially to Newfoundland which had a thriving trade with the nearby port of Poole. Examples of Verwood pots can be seen at the Verwood Heathland Heritage Centre. 
===Remembrance of those that fell in war===
The Verwood Memorial Recreation Ground is dedicated to those who fell in the World War I, and is owned by the Verwood Memorial Recreation Ground Trust. Members of the Verwood Town Council automatically become trustees. The Recreation Ground land was purchased by public subscription in 1920 and the parish council was to hold the land to the benefit of the inhabitants of the parish of Verwood for use as a public recreation ground. The Recreation Ground comprises an area big enough for a football pitch and several children&#x27;s play areas. It is across the road from the Memorial Stone, and had a set of wrought iron gates with a plaque on them saying &quot;Verwood Recreation Ground / In memory of those that fell in the Great War 1914-1918&quot;. 

It is widely believed that the oak trees around the recreation ground were planted in remembrance of each local person who fell in the First World War (one tree per person). These trees each have tree preservation orders to protect them.

In 1955 a formal Committee of Trustees was set up with the intention of building a new village hall, to be called the &quot;Memorial Hall&quot; in remembrance of those locals who valiantly gave their lives in World War II and it was agreed that the new hall should be constructed at the Recreation Ground. The official opening of Verwood Memorial Hall took place on 9 May 1959. The Memorial Hall was extended during the Queen’s Silver Jubilee year (1977). The hall has come under threat on a number of occasions, each time public pressure resisting its demolition. 

The Memorial Stone is across the road from the Memorial Hall and the Memorial Recreation Ground. Two plaques on the front of the stone are dedicated to the gallant souls who died in both world wars

===1980–present===
Verwood&#x27;s first supermarket opened in the 1980s. In 1985 the town was twinned with the French town Champtoceaux. In 1987 the population of Verwood reached 9,856. The Parish Council passed the necessary resolution to become a Town Council under provisions made in the 1972 Local Government Act. In 1992 the new Verwood Town Council offices were opened. Later that year, the town twinned with the German town Liederbach am Taunus. In 2001 the town&#x27;s population reached 12,069. Verwood Heritage Centre was opened by Rt. Hon. Viscount Cranborne. The centre is used as a museum of local history and a coffee shop. In 2007 the Verwood Hub, a multi-purpose cinema and theatre, opened to the public.

By 2014 the town had a population of over 15,000 and the Verwood Town Plan, published that year, identified a number of priorities including providing residents with new facilities, such as a swimming pool and an upper school.

==Politics and Government==
Verwood is a part of the North Dorset constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2015 by Simon Hoare, a Conservative. 

There has been a Parish or Town Council in Verwood since 1894 when it had a population of only 1,190. 

Verwood Town Council, the elected body of the Town, consists of eighteen members representing the Civil Parish. There are four wards in the Civil Parish: Dewlands North Ward (two councillors), Dewlands South Ward (eight councillors), Stephen&#x27;s Castle Ward (seven councillors) and Three Legged Cross Ward (one councillor). As a Council they meet eight times a year at the Council Offices and three times a year at the Village Hall, Three Legged Cross.

The Council operates with three sub-committees which each report to the full Council; the Finance &amp; General Purposes Committee, the Planning Consultative Committee and the Amenities Committee.

Verwood is a ward of Dorset Council, and (since the 2019 election) is represented by three County Councillors - Toni Coombs (Conservative), Spencer Flower (Conservative, Leader of the Council) and Simon Gibson (Conservative).

==Shopping and facilities==
A country market which is open from 10:00 to 11:30 is held each Friday in the Memorial Hall. The market sells locally produced seasonal vegetables and fruit, plants and cut flowers, homemade cakes and jams and craft items.

The town has a number of shopping areas: primarily in the town centre. Eating establishments include an Italian restaurant, Indian restaurant and takeaway, cafe, fish and chip shop, kebab shop, and a Chinese take-away.

Verwood is home to the Hub, a community facility which opened in April 2007. The Hub houses the 300 seat Merryfield Theatre, a 100-seat hall and a number of other smaller rooms. These facilities are used for films, plays, concerts and many other activities and the rooms can be hired by various organisations. In the centre of the Hub is a bistro area, surrounded by art displays and various exhibitions.

==Media and culture==
Verwood is proud to boast three thriving brass bands. Verwood Concert Brass Principal Band, Verwood Town Band, and Verwood Community Band. As at 2022, Verwood Concert Brass is in the championship section in the West of England Region under the baton of Kevin Smith. The band became West of England 4th Section champions in 2005 and 2006. This resulted in two trips to the National Brass Band Finals of Great Britain in Harrogate where they finished 6th and 7th respectively. In September 2008 the band were placed second at the 3rd section national finals after winning the area championship in March, and made another &#x27;Finals&#x27; appearance in 2009 in the 2nd section. They perform in many concerts in the local area including several performances at the Hub.

Verwood holds an annual carnival around the time of the Spring bank holiday.

==Stephen&#x27;s Castle and Stephen&#x27;s Stone==
Stephen’s Castle is an Iron Age barrow set in a SSSI site (site of special scientific interest), to the North of Verwood and at the top of an old sand and gravel quarry. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The barrow was excavated by archaeologists in 1828, where human remains dating back to the Iron Age were found.

The Stephen Stone is now well hidden amongst pine trees, surrounded by boggy ground. Located approximately 400m north-east from Stephen&#x27;s Castle, legend has it that Stephen was a local tribal chief of great strength. He was supposed to have hurled the &#x27;Stephen stone&#x27; half a mile into Ringwood Forest, no mean feat as the stone weighs around 3 tonnes. 
In 1220 Stephen&#x27;s Stone was recorded as &quot;LE HORESTONE&quot; and there was a boundary point in this area so it could be a boundary stone.

The Stone is an ancient block of sandstone, placed in a seemingly random location deep in the woods. It is not a native sandstone and no other such stones have been found in the area. This type of object is known as a &#x27;monolith&#x27; - a single massive stone or rock placed as a monument. Although it is now lying flat, it is thought to have originally stood upright so its height above the ground may have exceeded 10 feet. This being so, it would be one of the largest stones of this type ever to have stood in Dorset. The area is once meant to have been open heathland, with the view maybe extending as far as Hengistbury Head on the coast.

Lost for many years in the overgrown wilderness, only scattered references to the existence of such a stone were available. In 1841, an author recounted a 561-year-old testimony speaking of a large stone on the heathland of Verwood. In 1993, a prominent sacred site investigator named Peter Knight led a project to rediscover the stone. The site was then cleared in 1994 to allow public access.

Records suggest that many years ago, the local inhabitants regarded the stone with a sort of superstitious reverence and told long tales about the impossibility of removing it. There was meant to be a golden casket buried underneath the stone, and a belief that &quot;if anyone attempted to remove it, a black bird of dire omen perched upon its top to scare the miscreants.&quot; Perhaps the &#x27;golden casket&#x27; was in fact a metaphoric reference to powerful supernatural energies that may be accessible at this location. For whatever reason, warnings may have evolved to inform people not to misuse the site.

==Transport==

=== Road ===
The town effectively sits on the cross-roads of the B3081 and the B3072; connected to the A31 and A338 to the south-east via the B3081 and south to A31 at Ferndown via the B3072.

===Public bus services===

<text>The 1950 United Kingdom general election took place on Thursday 23 February 1950, the first held after a full term of a majority Labour government. The first election held after the abolition of plural voting and university constituencies, the governing Labour Party was returned to power–however, it&#x27;s majority was slashed from 146 seats to just 5, with the Conservative opposition gaining 90 seats.

Turnout increased to 83.9%, the highest turnout in a UK general election under universal suffrage, and representing an increase of more than 11% in comparison to 1945.

It was also the first general election to be covered on television, although no recording was made of the live broadcast, which was the standard practice at the time. Richard Dimbleby hosted the BBC coverage of the election, which he would later do again for the 1951, 1955, 1959 and the 1964 general elections. On this occasion, Dimbleby was joined in the BBC Alexandra Palace studios by R. B. McCallum, Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, and author of &quot;The British General Election of 1945&quot;, and David Butler, research student of Nuffield College. The first election night programme ran from 10:45 pm until just after 1:00 am.
==Background==

Significant changes since the 1945 general election included the abolition of plural voting by the Representation of the People Act 1948, and a major reorganisation of constituencies by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949. Eleven new English seats were created and six were abolished, and there were over 170 major alterations to constituencies across the country. Parliament was dissolved on 3 February 1950.

==Campaign==

The Conservatives, having recovered from their landslide election defeat in 1945, accepted most of the welfare state and nationalisation that had taken place under the Attlee government, which included the National Health Service and the mixed economy. The Tory manifesto, &quot;This Is The Road&quot;, accepted the new welfare state&#x27;s foundations but focused on the loss of freedoms and aspirations since 1945. Churchill claimed Attlee had not &quot;levelled up&quot; but had actually &quot;levelled down&quot;. The campaign essentially focused on the possible future nationalisation of other sectors and industries, which was supported by the Labour Party, and opposed by the Conservatives. The Liberals essentially viewed the struggle between the two parties on this issue as a class struggle.

One of the major election issues was the rationing still in effect on petrol, confectionery and meats over five years after the end of the war. The Conservative Party promised to phase out rationing while Labour campaigned for its continuation.

Analysis showed that Labour suffered huge losses of seats due to a &quot;revolt of the suburbs&quot;, with substantial swings against them among Middle England voters in London, the Home Counties, Essex and Middlesex. The effects of the Labour government&#x27;s austerity, and inflation had hit middle income voters hard. In particular, rationing of basic foods like bread and powdered egg was incredibly unpopular. While campaigning in Leicester, Attlee was met with &quot;catcalls&quot; and chants of &quot;vermin&quot; while Hugh Gaitskell sensed there was &quot;a collection of grievances among the lower middle class and middle class&quot; against Labour.

The Liberal Party fielded 475 candidates, more than at any general election since 1929. Liberal Party leader Clement Davies felt that the party had been at a disadvantage at the 1945 general election when they ran fewer candidates than needed to form a government. Davies arranged for the cost of running extra candidates to be offset by the party taking out insurance with Lloyd&#x27;s of London against more than fifty candidates losing their deposits. In the event, the strategy only succeeded in causing a very marginal increase in the overall Liberal vote over the previous election (although it was still their best popular vote percentage since 1929); the number of votes per candidate declined sharply, resulting in them losing a further three seats from their already-disappointing 1945 showing. A total of 319 Liberal candidates lost their deposits, a record number until the 2015 general election, when candidates for the Liberal Democrats lost 335 deposits at the general election held in that year.

==Results==
Despite losing 78 seats, the Labour Party won an overall majority of 5 seats, down from 146 in the previous election, while their vote share slightly declined. The Conservatives saw a resurgence in their support, gaining an additional 90 seats and saw their vote share improve by more than 4%.

Prominent personalities entering Parliament in this election included Edward Heath (Bexley), Jo Grimond (Orkney and Shetland), Enoch Powell (Wolverhampton South West), Reginald Maudling (Barnet) and Iain Macleod (Enfield West).

Scottish politician Willie Gallacher lost his West Fife seat to Labour; he was the last MP in Parliament for the Communist Party of Great Britain.

The election began the fractionalization of the Labour Party into Bevanite and Gaitskellite factions after Hugh Gaitskell blamed Aneurin Bevan for their party&#x27;s disappointing performance, leading to a growing rift between the two.

<doc id="379076" wikidata="Q1247828" url="?curid=379076" title="Ottery St Mary">
<text>Ottery St Mary, known as &quot;Ottery&quot;, is a town and civil parish in the East Devon district of Devon, England, on the River Otter, about east of Exeter on the B3174. At the 2001 census, the parish, which includes the villages of Metcombe, Fairmile, Alfington, Tipton St John, Wiggaton, and (until 2017) West Hill, had a population of 7,692. The population of the urban area alone at the 2011 census was 4,898. In 2021 the parish had a population of 7,986.

There are two electoral wards in Ottery (Rural and Town). The total population of both wards, including the adjacent civil parish of Aylesbeare, at the 2011 census was 9,022.

The town as it now stands has several independent shops, mainly in Mill Street, Silver Street and Yonder Street. An area known as &#x27;The Square&#x27;, is the heart of Ottery St Mary. There are pubs, restaurants, and coffee and tea rooms. Ottery provides services, employment, and a wide range of shopping for local residents and visitors from nearby villages and towns.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Ottery&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &#x27;Otri&#x27; and &#x27;Otrei&#x27;. &#x27;Oteri Sancte Marie&#x27; is first mentioned in 1242. The town takes its name from the River Otter (named after the animal) on which it stands. The town belonged to the church of St Mary in Rouen in 1086, hence &#x27;St Mary&#x27;.

Within the parish lies Chettisholt, noted as one of the fairly small number of Common Brittonic place-names surviving in England. The first element of this name is the Brittonic word which survives in modern Welsh as (&quot;wood&quot;); the last is the Old English word , also meaning &quot;wood&quot;, added to the name when its original meaning had been lost due to the dominant language of the area switching from Brittonic to Old English.

==History==
Archaeological excavations in 2014, in advance of a housing development at Island Farm, uncovered a medieval longhouse dating to AD.1250–1350.

Ottery&#x27;s notable buildings include the Tumbling Weir and St Mary&#x27;s church. The town is the site of The King&#x27;s School, formerly a grammar school but now a comprehensive school, founded in 1545 by Henry VIII, and of Ottery St Mary Primary School. The Old Town Hall now accommodates the local heritage museum.

The Chanter&#x27;s House is a Grade II listed building. The Listing summary states: &quot;Dates from the days of the College but little trace of antiquity remains, mainly enclosed by large brick outer additions by Butterfield including a 3rd storey, extending also above the C18 ... The C17 centre is the former Heath&#x27;s Court ...&quot; It dates from the 17th century, incorporating parts of the former Precentor&#x27;s house, known as Heath&#x27;s Court. In 1645, Oliver Cromwell held a convention in the house&#x27;s dining room, and Thomas Fairfax stayed at the house from October to December in that year. The building served as the headmaster&#x27;s lodging for the King&#x27;s School. Samuel Taylor Coleridge grew up here after his father, Rev. John Coleridge, moved there after being appointed headmaster and vicar of St Mary&#x27;s Church in 1769. The property remained in the Coleridge family until 2006, when it was sold to Max Norris who completed a major renovation over five years.

A report in June 2020 describes The Chanter&#x27;s House as having ten bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and a library (built by Coleridge) with 22,000 books, purchased with the property in 2006. The grounds include a &quot;walled gardens, stables, tennis court, a Victorian palm house and an aviary, as well as over 21 acres of gardens, woodland and streams ... [as well as] a lodge and a coach house.&quot; A news item states that the library includes &quot;diaries, notes and collections of poems, including &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;&quot; by 
Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

==Church==
The parish church of St Mary&#x27;s has been referred to as &quot;a miniature Exeter Cathedral&quot;. Like the cathedral it is cruciform in plan, with transepts formed by towers.

Nikolaus Pevsner described the building as &quot;lying large and low like a tired beast&quot;. It is long, and the towers are high. It was consecrated in 1260, at which time the manor and patronage of the church belonged to Rouen Cathedral, as it had from before the Norman invasion. Pevsner assumed that the tower-transepts and the outer walls of the chancel date back to 1260, and that the towers were built in imitation of those at Exeter.

In 1335 John Grandisson, (1327–69), Bishop of Exeter, bought the manor and advowson from Rouen, and two years later converted the church into a collegiate foundation with forty members. He rebuilt much of the church, and the present nave, chancel, aisles and Lady chapel date from this time. The nave is of five bays, and the chancel, unusually long in proportion, is of six, with vestry chapels to the north and south.

The church is noted for its painted ceiling and early 16th-century fan vaulted aisle, the Dorset Aisle, designed and commissioned by Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington, whose first husband was Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset.

The building was restored in 1850 by architect William Butterfield. His alterations included lowering the floor level of the transepts, crossing and western part of the chancel to that of the nave, and making the east end, designed for the needs of the collegiate foundation, more suitable for parochial use.

The church houses the Ottery St Mary Astronomical Clock, one of the oldest surviving mechanical clocks in the country. It is generally attributed to Bishop Grandisson and follows Ptolemaic cosmology placing the Earth at the centre of the solar system.

The church has ten misericords dating from the building of the church in 1350, five showing the arms of Bishop John de Grandisson. The church interior also has two medieval carved stone green men. There is a small stone plaque commemorating the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who was born here on 21 October 1772, in the south churchyard wall. Other interesting features include the tombs of Otho de Grandisson and his wife, the altar screen, sedilia, and a wooden eagle given by Bishop Grandisson.

Ottery St Mary parish registers, which begin in 1601, are held in the Devon Record Office.

This is a Grade I listed building, one of 107 Listed sites in the area. The summary provides this information: &quot;Consecrated by Bishop Bronescombe in 1260. Altered and added to by Bishop Grandison circa 1330. Mainly Early English ... 2 towers above transepts ... The interior was restored drastically mid C19 by Butterfield and others&quot;. The work in the 1300s included &quot;rebuilding of the nave, and addition of the Lady Chapel at the east end and two chantry chapels either side of the chancel&quot; according to a reliable source. Other renovations were completed circa 1520: &quot;principally expansion of the north nave aisle, complete with elaborate, fan-vaulted ceiling and pendant bosses&quot;.

== Schools ==
The town&#x27;s primary schools are West Hill Primary School which was established in 1876 and now has around 210 pupils, and Ottery St Mary Primary School with around 356 pupils.

The King&#x27;s School, located on the outskirts of the town, was established as a choir school by Bishop John Grandisson in 1335, but was replaced by a grammar school by Henry VIII in 1545. It became a comprehensive school in 1982 and is now a government-endowed Sports College with access to facilities shared by the public – namely the LED Sports Centre. The school has 1,100 students and 80 teachers.

==Local traditions==

=== Tar Barrels ===

The town typically stages annual events around Guy Fawkes Night when, in a tradition dating from the 17th century, barrels soaked in tar are set alight, and carried aloft through parts of the town by residents.

The festivities begin in the early evening with children&#x27;s, youths&#x27; and women&#x27;s events, culminating in the men&#x27;s event when a total of 17 barrels are lit outside each of the four public houses in the town. (Originally there were 12 public houses in the town). The barrels, increasing in size up to 30 kg, are carried through the town centre, often packed with onlookers, in an exhilarating and risky spectacle. Only those born in the town, or who have lived there for most of their lives, may carry a barrel. Generations of the same family have been known to compete across the years and it is thought that the event may have originated as a means of warding off evil spirits, similar to other British fire festivals, around the time of Halloween. In recent years the event has been jeopardised by the need for increasing public liability insurance coverage. Nevertheless, the event continues and the town of 7,000 people increases to well over 10,000. During the event all roads in and out of Ottery are closed for safety reasons with diversions in place.

On 30 October 2008 the annual event was threatened by a severe hailstorm, which hit East Devon shortly after midnight, with the Fire Service describing the situation in the Ottery St Mary area as &quot;absolute chaos&quot;. The storm led to serious flooding in the town, caused mainly by storm drains becoming clogged with hailstones. Roads became blocked and the Coastguard service was required to airlift some people to safety. The flooding also caused problems on the Millennium Green, where the annual bonfire and fairground were being constructed in preparation for 5 November celebrations. One of the owners of the fairground said that the builders working there were &quot;lucky to be alive&quot;. The clear-up operation was entirely successful, however, and both the carnival procession and the Tar Barrels and bonfire night celebrations went ahead as planned.

In 2009, the Factory Barrel was sabotaged by a visitor who threw an aerosol can into the barrel. The can exploded in the heat and 12 spectators required treatment for burns. In an unrelated incident, the roof of the old fire station burned down on the night of the 2009 tar barrels.

In 2020, the tar barrel event was cancelled as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

===Pixie Day===

Pixie Day is an old tradition which takes place annually in June. The day commemorates a legend of pixies being banished from the town to local caves known as the &#x27;Pixie&#x27;s Parlour&#x27;.

The Pixie Day legend originates from the early days of Christianity, when a local bishop decided to build a church in Otteri (Ottery St. Mary), and commissioned a set of bells to come from Wales, and to be escorted by monks on their journey.

On hearing of this, the pixies were worried, as they knew that once the bells were installed it would be the death knell of their rule over the land. So they cast a spell over the monks to redirect them from the road to Otteri to the road leading them to the cliff&#x27;s edge at Sidmouth. Just as the monks were about to fall over the cliff, one of the monks stubbed his toe on a rock and said &quot;God bless my soul&quot; and the spell was said to be broken.

The bells were then brought to Otteri and installed. However, the pixies&#x27; spell was not completely broken; each year on a day in June the &#x27;pixies&#x27; come out and capture the town&#x27;s bell ringers and imprison them in Pixies&#x27; Parlour to be rescued by the Vicar of Ottery St Mary. This legend is re-enacted each year by the Cub and Brownie groups of Ottery St Mary, with a specially constructed Pixie&#x27;s Parlour in the Town Square (the original Pixie&#x27;s Parlour can be found along the banks of the River Otter).

=== Old Ottregians Society ===
An inhabitant of Ottery St Mary is known as an &quot;Ottregian&quot;. One Sunday afternoon in 1898 six young men from Ottery, who were then living in London, met on the steps of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and resolved to form a Society to promote good fellowship among Ottery people wherever they may be. So was founded the Old Ottregians Society, which took as its motto &quot;Floreat Ottregia&quot; (&quot;May Ottery Flourish&quot;). The Old Ottregians society still exists (1997).

===Old Ottery song===
Another tradition in Ottery that continues today is the daily playing of the Old Ottery song. At eight o&#x27;clock, midday and four o&#x27;clock each day, the church of Ottery plays the Old Ottery song after the peal of the church bells. Tradition has it that the funerals of Old Ottregians always take place at 12.00 noon, with the funeral service commencing immediately following the playing of the Old Ottery song: The words are as follows (&#x27;kine&#x27; are cattle): &quot;Sweet-breathing kine, / The old grey Church, / The curfew tolling slow, / The glory of the Western Sky, / The warm red earth below. // O! Ottery dear! O! Ottery fair! My heart goes out to thee, Thou art my home, wher&#x27;er I roam, The West! The West for me!&quot;

=== John Coke&#x27;s ghost ===
Within St Mary&#x27;s Church, a colourful effigy of a soldier named John Coke can be found in a niche. He is said to have been murdered by a younger brother in 1632, and therefore tradition avers that his spirit steps down from the alcove and wanders about the church interior.

=== Media Appearance ===
A season 3 episode of the BBC radio comedy series &quot;Cabin Pressure&quot; features Ottery St Mary.

==Disasters==

=== Great fire ===

On 25 May 1866 a great fire occurred in Ottery. A newspaper report from the &quot;Exeter and Plymouth Gazette&quot; dated Friday, 1 June 1866, is summarized by historian J. Harris as follows:

The fire started about noon and the raged through the homes and shops of about a quarter of the town, reducing everything to ashes. The fire started on Jesu Street where the charity schools formerly stood. At first some people believed that the fire had been started by children playing with matches, but subsequent investigation has now proved this to be incorrect. It appears that the fire was started by a woman burning rubbish and papers in her cottage fireplace on Thursday. The fire smouldered and eventually burned through the wall to the school next door. It was eventually discovered at the top of the staircase in the schoolroom, near the cottage chimney around noon on Friday. It then spread very rapidly. Within hours one hundred houses had been destroyed, and 500 people rendered homeless – 10% of the population. A great part of the town extending westwards from the school to the silk factory in Mill Street was reduced to a heap of smouldering ruins.

=== Air crash ===
One evening in July 1980, a disaster was narrowly averted when an aircraft on approach to Exeter Airport crash-landed on the outskirts of town, in a field immediately south of the Salston Hotel. The aircraft, an Alidair Vickers Viscount turboprop, flying 62 passengers from Santander in Spain to Exeter was 11 miles short of the runway over a wooded area on East Hill, just before the town, when it ran out of fuel and all four engines stopped.

The pilot, who knew the area, was able to bank left and glide over the town&#x27;s southern edge and make a wheels-up crash-landing in a field. The aircraft was put down at 19.53 hours, in daylight, near St Saviours&#x27; Bridge, in a small grassy valley studded with trees. The 27-year-old aircraft was written off in the crash. The only casualties were two sheep.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch concluded that the accident had been primarily caused by the crew&#x27;s mistaken belief that there was sufficient fuel on board to complete the flight. The aircraft&#x27;s unreliable fuel gauges, the company&#x27;s pilots&#x27; method of establishing total fuel quantity, and the imprecise company instructions regarding the use of dipsticks were also considered to be major contributory factors. Meter indications on the refuelling vehicle at Santander, which could not have accurately reflected the quantity of fuel delivered, were also considered to have been a probable contributory factor.

The accident investigation report concluded, however, that the aircraft commander&#x27;s handling of the emergency once the aircraft&#x27;s four engines stopped had been skilful and assured. Had he not acted in the way he did, there could have been a considerable loss of life of both aircraft passengers and residents of the town. One of the propellers from the aircraft was later donated by the airline to the town to be auctioned for charity.

The town still lies under the flightpath for Exeter International Airport.

The Non-League football club, Ottery St Mary A.F.C. plays at Washbrook Meadows.

The Colin Tooze Sports Centre is located opposite the King&#x27;s School and the Move Forward Gym is located in Finnimore Trading Estate.

From 1968 to 1974, Ottery had a folk club that met regularly every week in the town&#x27;s London Inn with singers such as Cyril Tawney and other local artists appearing, as well a number of local singers. The club was listed in the EFDSS list of local rural folk clubs.

==Transport==
Until 1967 the town was served by Ottery St Mary railway station, which was closed under the Beeching Axe. The line ran from Sidmouth Junction (renamed as Feniton in 1971) on the main line from Exeter to Waterloo to the north of Ottery, and to Sidmouth and Exmouth to the south. The line split just south of Tipton St John, near the Bowd Inn. Both routes closed in March 1967. For many years the path of the railway, with the rails removed, remained in place, with evidence of the railway gates at places such as north of Cadhay Bridge. The closest railway station to Ottery St Mary is now at Feniton, approximately 3 miles away.

<text>Broccoflower is either of two edible plants of the species &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot; with light green heads. The edible portion is the immature flower head (inflorescence) of the plant.

Broccoli and cauliflower are different cultivars of the same species, and as such are fully cross compatible by hand pollination or natural pollinators. There are two forms of &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot; that may be referred to as broccoflower, both of which are considered cultivars of cauliflower (&quot;Brassica oleracea&quot; var. &quot;botrytis&quot;) because they have inflorescent meristems rather than flower buds when harvested. One is shaped like regular cauliflower, the other has pointed, conical, spiraling clusters of florets. They share a curd color that is a similar hue to that of broccoli.

==Green cauliflower==

The first form of broccoflower has the physical attributes of a white cauliflower, but the curd color is lime-green. There are several cultivars of green cauliflower on the market, with the first release being Green Ball, with parentage of both broccoli and cauliflower. The California firm Tanimura &amp; Antle trademarked the word &quot;Broccoflower&quot; for the green cauliflower that it markets.

==Romanesco broccoli==

The second form is Romanesco broccoli, which is characterised by the striking and unusual fractal patterns of its flower head. It has a yellow or vibrant green curd color.

<text>John Pond FRS (1767 – 7 September 1836) was an English astronomer who became the sixth Astronomer Royal, serving from 1811 to 1835.

== Biography ==
Pond was born in London and, although the year of his birth is known, the records indicating the day and month have been lost to posterity. Pond&#x27;s father made a fortune as a London merchant, enabling young John to enter Trinity College, Cambridge in 1784 at the age of sixteen. He took no degree, however, as his course was being interrupted by severe pulmonary attacks which compelled a long residence abroad. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1794, but his poor health prompted him to withdraw.

== Work ==

In 1800 Pond settled at Westbury near Bristol, and began to determine star-places with a fine altitude and azimuth circle of in diameter by Edward Troughton. His demonstration in 1806 of a change of form in the Greenwich mural quadrant led to the introduction of astronomical circles at the Royal Greenwich Observatory and to his own appointment as its head. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 26 February 1807. That same year he married and set up residence in London.

In 1811 Pond succeeded Nevil Maskelyne as Astronomer Royal. During an administration of nearly twenty-five years, he effected a reform of practical astronomy in England comparable to that brought about by Friedrich Bessel in Germany. In 1821 he began to employ the method of observation by reflection and in 1825 devised means of combining two mural circles in the determination of the place of a single object, the one serving for direct and the other for reflected vision. Under his auspices the instrumental equipment at Greenwich was completely changed and the number of assistants increased from one to six. The superior accuracy of his determinations was attested by Seth Carlo Chandler&#x27;s 1894 discussion of them in the course of his researches into the variation of latitude. Between 1810 and 1824 he persistently controverted the reality of Ireland&#x27;s Astronomer Royal John Brinkley&#x27;s imaginary star-parallaxes. During the 1829-31 period, he briefly served as Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac. Delicacy of health obliged his retirement in the autumn of 1835.

Among his honours were the Lalande Prize, conferred in 1817 by the French Academy of Sciences of which he was a corresponding member, and the Copley Medal, presented in 1823. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1822. He published eight folio volumes of Greenwich Observations, translated Pierre-Simon Laplace&#x27;s &quot;Système du monde&quot; and contributed thirty-one papers to scientific collections. His 1833 catalogue of positions of 1112 stars was of great value and displayed an accuracy which had previously never been achieved.

As Astronomer Royal, Pond was responsible for a substantial modernisation of the Observatory at Greenwich, extending from equipment improvements to new working practices. Perhaps his most noticeable addition was the 1833 installation of the time ball on the roof of the Observatory. Arguably, the first public time signal in the UK, the ball&#x27;s drop occurs daily at 1:00 p.m. and was intended to aid mariners on the Thames to synchronise their marine chronometers.

Pole Hill in Epping Forest lies directly on the Greenwich meridian and, being the highest point on that bearing directly visible from Greenwich, was at one time used as a marker by geographers at the Royal Observatory to set their telescopes and observation equipment to a true zero degree bearing. On the summit of the hill is an obelisk made of granite and bearing the following inscription:
This pillar was erected in 1824 under the direction of the Reverend John Pond, MA, Astronomer Royal. It was placed on the Greenwich Meridian and its purpose was to indicate the direction of true north from the transit telescope of the Royal Observatory. The Greenwich Meridian as changed in 1850 and adopted by international agreement in 1884 as the line of zero longitude passes 19 feet to the east of this pillar.
John Pond died in Blackheath, London in the year of his 69th birthday and was buried beside and near fellow Astronomers Royal Edmond Halley and Nathaniel Bliss, respectively, in the churchyard of St Margaret&#x27;s in nearby Lee.

<doc id="379100" wikidata="Q1523599" url="?curid=379100" title="Lord Lyon King of Arms">
<text>The Right Honourable the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the head of Lyon Court, is the most junior of the Great Officers of State in Scotland and is the Scottish official with responsibility for regulating heraldry in that country, issuing new grants of arms, and serving as the judge of the Court of the Lord Lyon, the oldest heraldic court in the world that is still in daily operation.

The historic title of the post was the &quot;High Sennachie&quot;, and he was given the title of Lord Lyon from the lion in the coat of arms of Scotland.

The post was in the early nineteenth century held by an important nobleman, the Earl of Kinnoull, whose functions were in practice carried out by the Lyon-Depute. The practice of appointing Lyon-Deputes, however, ceased in 1866.

== Responsibilities ==

The Lord Lyon is responsible for overseeing state ceremonial in Scotland, for the granting of new arms to persons or organisations, and for confirming proven pedigrees and claims to existing arms as well as recognising clan chiefs after due diligence. The Lyon Register (officially the &quot;Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland&quot;), on which the Lord Lyon records all Scotland&#x27;s coats of arms, dates from 1672. The Lord Lyon formerly also registered and recorded clan tartans, only upon request from the clan chief, but this function has been taken over by the Scottish Register of Tartans.

As Lyon Court is a government department, fees paid for granting coats of arms are paid to the Treasury. The misuse of arms is a criminal offence in Scotland, and treated as tax evasion. Prosecutions are brought before Lyon Court, Lord Lyon being the sole judge. Appeals from the Lyon Court can be made to the Court of Session in Edinburgh.

There is no appeal if the Lord Lyon refuses to grant a coat of arms, as this is not a judicial function, but an exercise of his ministerial function, although an appeal by way of judicial review may succeed if it can be shown that the Lord Lyon acted unreasonably.

== Equivalents ==
The Lord Lyon has several English equivalents:
* Being responsible for Scottish state ceremonies he parallels the Earl Marshal in England.
* The Lord Lyon is the heraldic authority for Scotland, much as the English Kings of Arms are responsible for granting arms in England. England has three &quot;Kings of Arms&quot;, or high heraldic officers (Lord Lyon is Scotland&#x27;s only one): Garter Principal, Clarenceux (responsible for southern England), and Norroy and Ulster (responsible for northern England and Northern Ireland). Unlike the English Kings of Arms, who cannot grant arms without a warrant from the (English) Earl Marshal, Lyon does not need permission, but grants by his own power.
* Whilst in England the Court of Chivalry (which last met in 1954) is a civil court, in Scotland the Lyon Court meets often and has criminal jurisdiction. Lord Lyon is empowered to have assumed coats of arms, and whatever they are affixed to, destroyed. As an example, when Leith Town Hall, now used as a police station, was renovated during the 1990s, several of the coats of arms decorating the Council Chamber were found to be attributed to the wrong person. The police were given special permission to retain the display, on condition that the tourist guides pointed out the historical anomalies.

The Lord Lyon is also one of the few individuals in Scotland officially permitted to fly the &quot;Lion Rampant&quot;, the Royal Banner of Scotland.

==Symbols of office==
A new collar of state was made in 1998 – a chain with 40 gold links, replacing the item that went missing after the Battle of Culloden. In 2003 a new crown was made for the Lord Lyon, modelled on the Scottish royal crown among the Honours of Scotland. This crown has removable arches (like one of the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother&#x27;s crowns) which will be removed at coronations to avoid any hint of lèse majesté.

<doc id="379119" wikidata="Q2363331" url="?curid=379119" title="Decline in amphibian populations">
<text>Since the 1980s, decreases in amphibian populations, including population decline and localized mass extinctions, have been observed in locations all over the world. This type of biodiversity loss is known as one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity. The possible causes include habitat destruction and modification, diseases, exploitation, pollution, pesticide use, introduced species, and ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B). However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and the topic is currently a subject of ongoing research. 

Modeling results found that the current extinction rate of amphibians could be 211 times greater than the background extinction rate. This estimate even goes up to 25,000–45,000 times if endangered species are also included in the computation.

Scientists began observing reduced populations of several European amphibian species already in the 1950s. Nevertheless, awareness of the phenomenon as a global problem and its subsequent classification as a modern-day mass extinction only dates from the 1980s.

== Observations ==

In the past three decades, declines in populations of amphibians (the class of organisms that includes frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians) have occurred worldwide. In 2004, the results were published of the first worldwide assessment of amphibian populations, the Global Amphibian Assessment. This found that 32% of species were globally threatened, at least 43% were experiencing some form of population decrease, and that between 9 and 122 species have become extinct since 1980. , the IUCN Red List, which incorporates the Global Amphibian Assessment and subsequent updates, lists 650 amphibian species as &quot;Critically Endangered&quot;, and 35 as &quot;Extinct&quot;. Despite the high risk this group faces, recent evidence suggests the public is growing largely indifferent to this and other environmental problems, posing serious problems for conservationists and environmental workers alike.

Declines in amphibian populations were first widely recognized in the late 1980s, when a large gathering of herpetologists reported noticing declines in populations in amphibians across the globe. Among these species, the golden toad (&quot;Bufo periglenes&quot;) endemic to Monteverde, Costa Rica, featured prominently. It was the subject of scientific research until populations suddenly crashed in 1987 and it had disappeared completely by 1989. Other species at Monteverde, including the Monteverde harlequin frog (&quot;Atelopus varius&quot;), also disappeared at the same time. Because these species were located in the pristine Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, and these extinctions could not be related to local human activities, they raised particular concern among biologists.

Many scientists believe that amphibians serve as &quot;canaries in a coal mine&quot;, and that declines in amphibian populations and species indicate that other groups of animals and plants will soon be at risk.

=== Initial skepticism ===
When amphibian declines were first presented as a conservation issue in the late 1980s, some scientists remained unconvinced of the reality and gravity of the conservation issue. Some biologists argued that populations of most organisms, amphibians included, naturally vary through time. They argued that the lack of long-term data on amphibian populations made it difficult to determine whether the anecdotal declines reported by biologists were worth the (often limited) time and money of conservation efforts.

However, since this initial skepticism, biologists have come to a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity. This consensus emerged with an increase in the number of studies that monitored amphibian populations, direct observation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and an awareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.

== Causes ==
Habitat loss, disease and climate change are thought to be responsible for the drastic decline in populations in recent years. 

Declines have been particularly intense in the western United States, Central America, South America, eastern Australia and Fiji (although cases of amphibian extinctions have appeared worldwide). While human activities are causing a loss of much of the world&#x27;s biodiversity, amphibians appear to be suffering much greater effects than other classes of organism. Because amphibians generally have a two-staged life cycle consisting of both aquatic (larvae) and terrestrial (adult) phases, they are sensitive to both terrestrial and aquatic environmental effects. Because their skins are highly permeable, they may be more susceptible to toxins in the environment than other organisms such as birds or mammals. 

Numerous potential explanations for amphibian declines have been proposed. Most or all of these causes have been associated with some population declines, so each cause is likely to affect in certain circumstances but not others. Many of the causes of amphibian declines are well understood, and appear to affect other groups of organisms as well as amphibians. These causes include habitat modification and fragmentation, introduced predators or competitors, introduced species, pollution, pesticide use, or over-harvesting. However, many amphibian declines or extinctions have occurred in pristine habitats where the above effects are not likely to occur. The causes of these declines are complex, but many can be attributed to emerging diseases, climate change, increased ultraviolet-B radiation, or long-distance transmission of chemical contaminants by wind.

Artificial lighting has been suggested as another potential cause. Insects are attracted to lights making them scarcer within the amphibian habitats.

=== Habitat modification ===

Habitat modification or destruction is one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be more vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.

=== Habitat fragmentation ===

Habitat fragmentation occurs when habitats are isolated by habitat modification, such as when a small area of forest is completely surrounded by agricultural fields. Small populations that survive within such fragments are often susceptible to inbreeding, genetic drift, or extinction due to small fluctuations in the environment.

=== Disease ===
Research from 2007 and 2018 indicated that the reemergence of varieties of chytrid fungi may account for a substantial fraction of the overall decline. 

A number of diseases have been related to mass die-offs or declines in populations of amphibians, including &quot;red-leg&quot; disease (&quot;Aeromonas hydrophila&quot;), &quot;Ranavirus&quot; (family Iridoviridae), &quot;Anuraperkinsus&quot;, and chytridiomycosis. It is not entirely clear why these diseases have suddenly begun to affect amphibian populations, but some evidence suggests that these diseases may have been spread by humans, or may be more virulent when combined with other environmental factors.

==== Trematodes ====
There is considerable evidence that parasitic trematode platyhelminths (a type of fluke) have contributed to developmental abnormalities and population declines of amphibians in some regions. These trematodes of the genus &quot;Ribeiroia&quot; have a complex life cycle with three host species. The first host includes a number of species of aquatic snails. The early larval stages of the trematodes then are transmitted into aquatic tadpoles, where the metacercariae (larvae) encyst in developing limb buds. These encysted life stages produce developmental abnormalities in post-metamorphic frogs, including additional or missing limbs. These abnormalities increase frog predation by aquatic birds, the final host of the trematode.
A study showed that high levels of nutrients used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in ponds and lakes across North America. The study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs.

=== Pollution and chemical contaminants ===
There is evidence of chemical pollutants causing frog developmental deformities (extra limbs, or malformed eyes). Pollutants have varying effects on frogs. Some alter the central nervous system; others cause a disruption in the production and secretion of hormones. Experimental studies have also shown that exposure to commonly used herbicides such as glyphosate (Tradename Roundup) or insecticides such as malathion or carbaryl greatly increase mortality of tadpoles. Additional studies have indicated that terrestrial adult stages of amphibians are also susceptible to non-active ingredients in Roundup, particularly POEA, which is a surfactant. Although sex reversal in some species of frogs occur naturally in pristine environments, certain estrogen-like pollutants can forcibly induce these changes. In a study conducted in a laboratory at Uppsala University in Sweden, more than 50% of frogs exposed to levels of estrogen-like pollutants existing in natural bodies of water in Europe and the United States became females. Tadpoles exposed even to the weakest concentration of estrogen were twice as likely to become females while almost all of the control group given the heaviest dose became female.

While most pesticide effects are likely to be local and restricted to areas near agriculture, there is evidence from the Sierra Nevada mountains of the western United States that pesticides are traveling long distances into pristine areas, including Yosemite National Park in California.

Some recent evidence points to ozone as a possible contributing factor to the worldwide decline of amphibians.

=== Ozone depletion, ultraviolet radiation and cloud cover ===

Like many other organisms, increasing ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion and other factors may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The amount of damage depends upon the life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, are more susceptible to the effects of loss of the ozone layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.

More than three dozen species of amphibians have been studied, with severe effects reported in more than 40 publications in peer-reviewed journals representing authors from North America, Europe and Australia. Experimental enclosure approaches to determine UVB effects on egg stages have been criticized; for example, egg masses were placed at water depths much shallower than is typical for natural oviposition sites. While UVB radiation is an important stressor for amphibians, its effect on the egg stage may have been overstated.

Anthropogenic climate change has likely exerted a major effect on amphibian declines. For example, in the Monteverde Cloud Forest, a series of unusually warm years led to the mass disappearances of the Monteverde Harlequin frog and the Golden Toad. An increased level of cloud cover, a result of geoengineering and global warming, which has warmed the nights and cooled daytime temperatures, has been blamed for facilitating the growth and proliferation of the fungus &quot;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&quot; (the causative agent of the fungal infection chytridiomycosis).

Although the immediate cause of the die offs was the chytrid, climate change played a pivotal role in the extinctions. Researchers included this subtle connection in their inclusive climate-linked epidemic hypothesis, which acknowledged climatic change as a key factor in amphibian extinctions both in Costa Rica and elsewhere.

New evidence has shown global warming to also be capable of directly degrading toads&#x27; body condition and survivorship. Additionally, the phenomenon often colludes with landscape alteration, pollution, and species invasions to effect amphibian extinctions.

=== Introduced predators ===

Non-native predators and competitors have also been found to affect the viability of frogs in their habitats. The mountain yellow-legged frog which typically inhabits the Sierra Nevada lakes have seen a decline in numbers due to stocking of non-native fish (trout) for recreational fishing. The developing tadpoles and froglets fall prey to the fish in large numbers. This interference in the frog&#x27;s three-year metamorphosis is causing a decline that is manifest throughout their ecosystem.

=== Increased noise levels ===
Frogs and toads are highly vocal, and their reproductive behaviour often involves the use of vocalizations. There have been suggestions that increased noise levels caused by human activities may be contributing to their declines. In a study in Thailand, increased ambient noise levels were shown to decrease calling in some species and to cause an increase in others. This has, however, not been shown to be a cause for the widespread decline.

== Symptoms of stressed populations ==
Amphibian populations in the beginning stages of decline often exhibit a number of signs, which may potentially be used to identify at-risk segments in conservation efforts. One such sign is developmental instability, which has been proven as evidence of environmental stress. This environmental stress can potentially raise susceptibility to diseases such as chytridiomycosis, and thus lead to amphibian declines. In a study conducted in Queensland, Australia, for example, populations of two amphibian species, &quot;Litoria nannotis&quot; and &quot;Litoria genimaculata&quot;, were found to exhibit far greater levels of limb asymmetry in pre-decline years than in control years, the latter of which preceded die offs by an average of 16 years. Learning to identify such signals in the critical period before population declines occur might greatly improve conservation efforts.

== Conservation measures ==

The first response to reports of declining amphibian populations was the formation of the Declining Amphibian Population Task Force (DAPTF) in 1990. DAPTF led efforts for increased amphibian population monitoring in order to establish the extent of the problem, and established working groups to look at different issues. Results were communicated through the newsletter Froglog.

Much of this research went into the production of the first Global Amphibian Assessment (GAA), which was published in 2004 and assessed every known amphibian species against the IUCN Red List criteria. This found that approximately one third of amphibian species were threatened with extinction. As a result of these shocking findings an Amphibian Conservation Summit was held in 2005, because it was considered &quot;morally irresponsible to document amphibian declines and extinctions without also designing and promoting a response to this global crisis&quot;.

Outputs from the Amphibian Conservation Summit included the first Amphibian Conservation Action Plan (ACAP) and to merge the DAPTF and the Global Amphibian Specialist Group into the IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group (ASG). The ACAP established the elements required to respond to the crisis, including priority actions on a variety of thematic areas. The ASG is a global volunteer network of dedicated experts who work to provide the scientific foundation for effective amphibian conservation action around the world.

The ACAP (Gascon et al 2007), concerned that time and capability were short, recommended that all relevant species be immediately incorporated into ex situ breeding programs. On 16 February 2007, scientists worldwide met in Atlanta, U.S., to form a group called the Amphibian Ark to help save more than 6,000 species of amphibians from disappearing by starting captive breeding programmes. Overall between the call to action in 2007 and 2019 there has been a 57% increase in number of breeding programs, or 77 additional species.

Areas with noticed frog extinctions, like Australia, have few policies that have been created to prevent the extinction of these species. However, local initiatives have been placed where conscious efforts to decrease global warming will also turn into a conscious effort towards saving the frogs. In South America, where there is also an increased decline of amphibian populations, there is no set policy to try to save frogs. Some suggestions would include getting entire governments to place a set of rules and institutions as a source of guidelines that local governments have to abide by.

A critical issue is how to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts through the use of protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred. It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.

Education of local people to protect amphibians is crucial, along with legislation for local protection and limiting the use of toxic chemicals, including some fertilizers and pesticides in sensitive amphibian areas.

<text>The Oriental turtle dove or rufous turtle dove (Streptopelia orientalis) is a member of the bird family Columbidae. The species has a wide native distribution range from Central Asia east across Asia to Japan. The populations show variations in the patterning of plumage and have been designated into at least six named subspecies. Populations in the higher latitudes tend to migrate south in winter, while those closer to the tropics are sedentary. Vagrants have been recorded in North America. The species is predominantly granivorous and forages on the ground.

==Taxonomy ==

The genus name &quot;Streptopelia&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;streptos&quot;, &quot;collar&quot; and &quot;peleia&quot;, &quot;dove&quot;. The specific &quot;orientalis&quot; is Latin for &quot;eastern&quot;, in this case referring to the type locality, China.

The species has a wide distribution with geographical variation in plumage that has led to at least six subspecies being designated. The distributions of many are not disjunct and gradation exists except in some island populations. Some of the populations of &quot;Streptopelia turtur&quot; that occur on the eastern edge can be very similar in appearance to &quot;S. orientalis&quot; and in the past the two species have been lumped together.
*western Oriental turtle dove (&quot;S. o. meena&quot;) – eastern Asia and Central Asia south to the Himalayas from Kashmir to central Nepal. Winters in India as far south as Sri Lanka. 
*eastern Oriental turtle dove (&quot;S. o. orientalis&quot;) – central Siberia to Japan and Korea south to the Himalayas from Assam to Yunnan and northern Vietnam. Winters in South and Southeast Asia (includes &quot;S. baicalensis&quot; Buturlin). 
* &quot;S. o. stimpsoni&quot; – the Ryukyu Islands 
* &quot;S. o. orii&quot; – Taiwan 
* &quot;S. o. erythrocephala&quot; – southern peninsular India. This subspecies is reddish-brown on the head with no grey on the forehead or crown, unlike the other subspecies. The undertail coverts and terminal tail band are slaty grey. 
* &quot;S. o. agricola&quot; – from Orissa and Bengal to northeastern India and into Myanmar south to Hainan 
The Oriental turtle dove has two distinct migratory northern subspecies, &quot;S. o. orientalis&quot; in the central Siberian taiga, and &quot;S. o. meena&quot; in the open woodlands of Central Asia. The differences in the tail patterns of the subspecies &quot;S. o. orientalis&quot; and &quot;S. o. meena&quot; help separate identification in their wintering grounds. The nominate form is described as having a grey tip to the tail and more black in the outer web of the outer tail feathers, while &quot;meena&quot; has a white tip to its tail like the European turtle dove and less black in the outer web of the outer tail feathers. However, these are not consistent differences: both forms can have white or grey tail-bands and &quot;orientalis&quot; can have little black in the outer webs of the outer tail feathers.

==Description==
The Oriental dove is very similar in plumage to the Turtle dove. It is a little larger than that species, particularly in the case of &quot;orientalis&quot;, about the same size as a collared dove. It shares the black and white striped patch on the side of its neck made of silver-tipped feathers, but the breast is less pink, and the orange-brown wing feathers of the turtle dove are replaced with a browner hue, and darker centres giving a scaly appearance. The tail is wedge shaped, like the turtle dove. The flight is more relaxed and direct than that of its relative. Additionally, the turtle-dove has a bare patch of skin around its eyes, which the oriental dove lacks.

===Call===
The calls are different from the purring of the European turtle dove. It is a four-syllable &quot;her-her-oo-oo&quot;. There are significant call differences within the populations as well.

==Distribution and habitat==
The habitat varies, but the Oriental turtle dove breeds in well-wooded but open habitats and winters in more open habitats but usually with good tree cover.

The westernmost race, &quot;meena&quot;, breeds in the Western Palearctic region. The southernmost populations are resident, but most other birds migrate south to winter in India, the Maldives, and southern Japan. They disperse widely and are known from islands such as the Lakshadweep in winter. &quot;S. o. orientalis&quot; occurs as a rarity in western Alaska and British Columbia. It is also a vagrant to northern and western Europe and occurrences in Britain tend to gather much attention from twitchers.

== Ecology ==

=== Breeding ===
The summer breeding season in the temperate zone can be protracted. In southern India, the breeding season is in winter. In display, the male flaps its wing noisily and shoots up before gliding down with outspread tail. Nests take about two days to build with the male gathering material and the female placing it. The nest is more substantial than in some other doves and is placed at mid-canopy height. In Japan, nests built at a greater height tended to be prone to predation. Males were found to incubate in the day and the female by night. Two white eggs, as for all pigeons and doves, are laid in a twig nest in a tree. Incubation begins immediately after the first egg is laid. The eggs hatch in 15 to 16 days and the chicks take about 15 to 17 days to fledge (in Japan). Both parents feed the altricial chicks with crop milk. Multiple broods may be raised and nests built by the pair or by others may be reused. Nest reuse may possibly increase the chances of predation. In Japan the principal predators of nestlings and eggs were crows and magpies and to a lesser extent cats and snakes.

=== Diet ===
The Oriental turtle dove is granivorous, and feeds on the seeds of hemp, sunflower, wheat, millet and amaranth. It also consumes gastropods. They forage on the ground.

=== Parasites and diseases ===
Nests in Japan that have accumulated faeces have been found to host a number of flies belonging to the families Sphaeroceridae, Sepsidae, and Stratiomyidae.

Subcutaneous mites of the species &quot;Hypodectes propus&quot; have been recorded in Japan. Deaths of a number of birds due to avian pox virus have been recorded in South Korea.

=== Other associations ===
On Hongdo Island, Korea, migratory doves were found to carry seeds of the exotic &quot;Achyranthes japonica&quot; attached to their plumage.

== In culture ==
The Ainu people traditionally interpret bird calls as elaborate sayings in their own language. In the case of these doves, the ascribed saying, an amalgam of several, is as follows:

The reason the dove is said to be &#x27;ploughing&#x27; is that it is often seen burrowing in the fields with its feet in search of food, and thus appears as such.

<text>Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton (18 October 1863 – 19 February 1930) was a Scottish consulting electrical engineer, who provided the theoretical basis for the electronic television, two decades before the technology existed to implement it. He began experimenting around 1903 with the use of cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) for the electronic transmission and reception of images. Campbell described the theoretical basis for an all electronic method of producing television in a 1908 letter to &quot;Nature&quot;. Campbell-Swinton&#x27;s concept was central to the cathode ray television because of his proposed modification of the CRT that allowed its use as both a transmitter and receiver of light. The CRT was the system of electronic television that was subsequently developed in later years, as technology caught up with Campbell-Swinton&#x27;s initial ideas. Other inventors would use Campbell-Swinton&#x27;s ideas as a starting-point to realise the CRT television as the standard, workable form of all electronic television that it became for decades after his death. It is generally considered that the original credit for the successful theoretical conception of using a CRT device for imaging should belong to Campbell-Swinton.

==Life==

He was born in Edinburgh the son of advocate Archibald Campbell Swinton.

Campbell-Swinton was educated at Cargilfield Trinity School and Fettes College (1878–1881).

He was one of the first to explore the medical applications of radiography, opening the first radiographic laboratory in the United Kingdom in 1896. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1915. He is better known by his work on the electronic television. He discovered the phenomenon known as &quot;magnetic focusing&quot; in 1896, he found that a longitudinal magnetic field generated by an axial coil can focus an electron beam.

Campbell-Swinton wrote a letter in response to an article in the 4 June 1908 issue of &quot;Nature&quot; by Shelford Bidwell entitled &quot;Telegraphic Photography and Electric Vision&quot;. Even as early as 1908, it was recognised that &quot;The final, insurmountable problems with any form of mechanical scanning were the limited number of scans per second, which produced a flickering image, and the relatively large size of each hole in the disk, which resulted in poor resolution&quot;.

Campbell-Swinton&#x27;s letter was published in the 18 June 1908 issue of &quot;Nature&quot;. The name of the article is &quot;Distant Electric Vision&quot;. He wrote: &quot;This part of the problem of obtaining distant electric vision can probably be solved by the employment of two beams of cathode rays (one at the transmitting and one at the receiving station) synchronously deflected by the varying fields of two electromagnets placed at right angles to one another and energised by two alternating electric currents of widely different frequencies, so that the moving extremities of the two beams are caused to sweep simultaneously over the whole of the required surface within the one-tenth of a second necessary to take advantage of visual persistence. Indeed, so far as the receiving apparatus is concerned, the moving cathode beam has only to be arranged to impinge on a suitably sensitive fluorescent screen, and given suitable variations in its intensity, to obtain the desired result.&quot;

He gave a speech in London in 1911 where he described in great detail how distant electric vision could be achieved. This was to be done by using cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) at both the transmitting and receiving ends. The photoelectric screen in the proposed transmitting device was a mosaic of isolated rubidium cubes. This was the first iteration of the electronic television which is still in use today. When Swinton gave his speech others had already been experimenting with the use of CRTs as a receiver, but the use of the technology as a transmitter was unheard of. His concept for a fully electronic television system was later popularised by Hugo Gernsback as the &quot;Campbell-Swinton Electronic Scanning System&quot; in the August 1915 issue of the popular magazine &quot;Electrical Experimenter&quot;. 

In 1914 he once again described his system in his presidential address to the Roentgen Ray Society and in 1921 a book was published describing it in some detail. He himself described his system seven years later in the June 1928 issue of &quot;Modern Wireless&quot;, &quot;Television by Cathode Rays&quot;. 
:&quot;Surely it would be better policy if those who can afford the time and money would abandon mechanical devices and expend their labours in what appears likely to prove the ultimately more promising method in which the only moving parts are imponderable electrons.&quot;

In a letter to &quot;Nature&quot; published in October 1926, Campbell-Swinton also announced the results of some &quot;not very successful experiments&quot; he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M. Stanton. They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam. These experiments were conducted before March 1914, when Minchin died, but they were later repeated by two different teams in 1937, by his students H. Miller and J. W. Strange from EMI, and by H. Iams and A. Rose from RCA. Both teams succeeded in transmitting &quot;very faint&quot; images with the original Campbell-Swinton&#x27;s selenium-coated plate, but much better images were obtained when the metal plate was covered with zinc sulphide or selenide, or with aluminium or zirconium oxide treated with caesium. These experiments are the base of the future vidicon.

Alongside his research into the electrical transmission of images, Campbell-Swinton also worked in voice telephony, founding the short-lived Equitable Telephone Association in the 1880s.

<text>The Battle of Cotton Plant also known as Action at Hill&#x27;s Plantation or Action at Cache River or Action at Round Hill (July 7, 1862) was fought during the American Civil War in Woodruff County, Arkansas. Frustrated in its attempt to march to Little Rock by a lack of supplies, the Union Army of the Southwest under the command of Samuel Ryan Curtis moved south down the White River. Curtis&#x27;s army encountered a Confederate force led by Albert Rust on the east bank of the Cache River near Cotton Plant. Rust was only able to bring two Texas cavalry regiments into action. These horsemen attacked the Federal advance guard under Charles Edward Hovey, but after a spirited fight, Union reinforcements arrived and drove off the Texans. Rust&#x27;s force made a disorderly retreat and Curtis&#x27;s army was able to march south to Clarendon before veering east to occupy Helena on the Mississippi River.

==Background==
===Strategic situation===
A few weeks after the Union victory at the Battle of Pea Ridge on March 7–8, 1862, Union General Curtis received reports that General Earl Van Dorn&#x27;s Confederate army was moving east. On April 5, Curtis&#x27;s department commander General Henry Halleck authorized a move eastward to block a possible offensive by Van Dorn. Accordingly, the Army of the Southwest marched east through the Missouri towns of Cassville, Forsyth, and West Plains. In fact, on March 23, General Albert Sidney Johnston ordered Van Dorn&#x27;s troops to move to Corinth, Mississippi where a large Confederate army was assembling. In his zeal to execute the new instructions, Van Dorn denuded Arkansas of soldiers, weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies. Ironically, Van Dorn&#x27;s troops arrived too late to fight in the Battle of Shiloh on April 6–7, a Confederate defeat.

===Advance on Little Rock fails===
After Shiloh, Halleck instructed Curtis to move into northeast Arkansas and rendezvous with another Federal force under General Frederick Steele. Curtis&#x27;s army marched south from White Plains, crossing the state line on April 29 and reaching Batesville, Arkansas on May 2. Steele&#x27;s soldiers arrived in nearby Jacksonport on May 4. However, Halleck directed Curtis to move half of his infantry to Cape Girardeau, Missouri where they would be transferred east of the Mississippi River. Dutifully, Curtis gathered seven Illinois, two Missouri, and one Indiana regiments, placed them under Generals Jefferson C. Davis and Alexander Asboth and sent them to Halleck. Curtis reorganized his remaining soldiers into three divisions: the Indiana regiments in the 1st under Steele, the Illinois and Iowa regiments in the 2nd under General Eugene Asa Carr, and the Missouri regiments in the 3rd under General Peter J. Osterhaus. Halleck then ordered Curtis to occupy Little Rock, about south. Curtis&#x27;s May strength returns listed 6,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry, and 1,000 artillerymen.

The Federal occupation of Batesville prompted Arkansas Governor Henry Massey Rector to call out the militia and move the state archives from Little Rock. Confederate General John Selden Roane complained that he was left to fight with &quot;No troops - no arms - no powder&quot; and vowed to detain all Texas units in transit through the state. P. G. T. Beauregard responded to Roane&#x27;s request for a new leader by naming General Thomas C. Hindman to take charge of the Trans-Mississippi Department. Hindman&#x27;s methods were high-handed, but he quickly managed to amass a field army of 4,000 Texas cavalry, 1,500 Arkansas infantry, and a battery of light artillery. Osterhaus&#x27;s 3rd Division crossed the White River on May 7 and four days later it reached the Little Red River near Searcy. In the Battle of Whitney&#x27;s Lane on May 19, 1862, Texas cavalrymen attacked a Federal foraging party of the 17th Missouri Volunteer Infantry and inflicted a loss of 15 killed, 32 wounded, and two missing. The next day, Carr&#x27;s 2nd Division arrived on the Little Red River, ready to continue the advance. That day a message reached Curtis from the army&#x27;s quartermaster that stated the army could no longer be supplied over the distance to the railhead at Rolla, Missouri. Curtis abandoned the drive on Little Rock.

===Down the White River===
On May 27, Curtis ordered the cavalry of Osterhaus and Carr to raid Confederate-held territory south of the Little Red River. Under cover of this operation, Union foraging parties collected more supplies. However, on June 4 the Federals fell back to Batesville. Curtis warned Halleck that the logistical situation was so dire that he might have to retreat to Missouri. The Siege of Corinth successfully ended on May 30, so Halleck responded by sending an expedition under Graham N. Fitch of the army and James Shirk of the navy up the White River. Aside from several regiments of infantry, the transports carried 100,000 bushels of grain and 2,500 bales of hay for Curtis&#x27;s army. In the Battle of Saint Charles on June 17, the expedition suffered a setback when a Confederate round shot pierced the steam drum of the &quot;USS Mound City&quot; killing half its crew and injuring most of the survivors. Nevertheless, the expedition pushed upriver and reached Clarendon where it was halted by low water. When Curtis found that the expedition had stalled he decided to move down the White River toward Clarendon. In order to make this move, the Union commander had to cut his supply line to Rolla and order his soldiers live off the countryside. The Army of the Southwest left Batesville at the end of June. As Curtis&#x27;s army moved, they foraged, pillaged, and destroyed property to the amount of $1.5 million. Abetted by the soldiers, African-American slaves fled from their plantations and over 3,000 joined the army on its march while others headed for Missouri.

On 24 June 1862, Hindman received information that Curtis&#x27;s army was moving south down the east bank of the White River. He sent the Colonel Sweet&#x27;s 15th Texas Cavalry Regiment on a raid across the White River above Batesville. Hindman claimed that 200 Union soldiers were taken prisoner and some supply wagons were captured before Colonel Cadwallader C. Washburn&#x27;s Federal cavalry brigade drove off the Texans. Hindman ordered General Rust to cross to the east bank of the White at Des Arc and move upstream to a blocking position behind the Cache River. Concentrating at Cotton Plant, Rust&#x27;s force was increased to a strength of 5,000 troops. Rust was ordered to block the roads, burn bridges, and destroy all food supplies, but this instruction was not carried out. Hindman himself remained at DeVall&#x27;s Bluff with about 2,000 soldiers to oppose the Union river expedition. He also armed the steamer &quot;Tom Sugg&quot; with an 8-inch Columbiad to guard the White River. Hindman intended to leave 500 men to hold Devall&#x27;s Bluff and march with the rest to reinforce Rust, but by then it was too late. Curtis advanced over the Cache.

==Opposing forces==
The Battle of Cotton Plant saw a 10,000-strong Union Army commanded by Samuel Ryan Curtis encounter a 5,000-man Confederate force led by Albert Rust. A Union advance guard commanded by Charles Edward Hovey did most of the fighting, repelling an attack by two Texas cavalry regiments led by William Henry Parsons. Union reinforcements under William P. Benton arrived and pressed the Texas cavalry and Arkansas infantry into a disorderly retreat. Curtis&#x27;s army subsequently occupied Helena. At the Battle of L&#x27;Anguille Ferry near Marianna on August 3, 1862, the Texas cavalry overran a Union wagon convoy.

== Battle ==

On July 7, 1862, the Army of the Southwest reached James Ferry on the Cache River, found that the water was low enough to ford, and began to cross. Colonel Charles Edward Hovey who led a brigade in Steele&#x27;s 1st Division sent Colonel Charles Harris of the 11th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment with 400 soldiers to scout ahead. Harris&#x27;s advance force included four companies of the 11th Wisconsin, four companies of the 33rd Illinois Infantry Regiment, and a detachment of the 1st Indiana Cavalry Regiment including one cannon. Harris led his force south to a road intersection at Parley Hill&#x27;s Plantation which was about northwest of Cotton Plant. Harris directed his troops down the Clarendon road which led toward Cotton Plant. However, Hovey learned that a Federal soldier was captured, recalled Harris, and ordered him to take the Des Arc road that led to the southwest.
Rust&#x27;s force consisted of five regiments of Texas cavalry, three regiments of Arkansas infantry, and one battery of artillery. Rust ordered Colonel William H. Parsons with 1,000 troopers of Parson&#x27;s own 12th Texas Cavalry Regiment and Colonel William Fitzhugh&#x27;s 16th Texas Cavalry Regiments to hold the river crossing at James Ferry. The day before, the 12th Texas was prepared to advance. But Parsons decided to wait for the 16th Texas which was slow, so the 12th Texas camped about south of the crossing. About 9:00 am, Parsons learned that Union soldiers were crossing the Cache at James Ferry. He turned northeast to follow the Des Arc road and sent 20 horsemen ahead in skirmish formation across a cypress swamp.

Hovey held one Wisconsin company at the intersection and sent Harris forward with the rest. Harris&#x27;s three Wisconsin companies passed the Hill house, a cornfield, and then entered a forest in skirmish formation. One Illinois company and the cannon backed-up the skirmishers. The other three Illinois companies were farther back. As the Wisconsin skirmishers groped through the underbrush they spotted Parsons&#x27;s horsemen. The first firing started at range between the 20 Texas skirmishers and some Union cavalrymen. At least three Texans were hit right away. Harris pressed forward but his skirmishers were hit by a blast of fire when they bumped into the main body of the 12th Texas. Harris was wounded but kept directing his men. The Texas cavalry charged on horseback, driving back the Wisconsin troops. Edward M. Pike won the Medal of Honor for actions that saved the Union cannon from capture. Hovey ordered the three Wisconsin companies, the supporting Illinois company, and the gun to retreat toward the intersection. Hovey sent the remaining three Illinois companies to take cover in the cornfield. As Parsons&#x27;s horsemen burst from the trees in pursuit of the Wisconsin soldiers, the Federals in the cornfield met them with a shattering volley followed by heavy fire. After many saddles were emptied, the Texas cavalry retreated into the forest. Hovey held his ground and waited for the next Confederate move. Parsons&#x27;s horsemen pulled back behind the cypress swamp.

In an attempt to separate Hovey&#x27;s force from Curtis&#x27;s main body, Rust accompanied Colonel James R. Taylor&#x27;s 17th Texas Cavalry Regiment in a wide sweep to the northeast. The horsemen circled through Cotton Plant and neared the road intersection. But as they approached, the Confederates heard the tap of a drum and a large number of Union soldiers rose to their feet. The Texas regiment withdrew. These Union troops were the four Wisconsin companies, the Illinois company, and the one gun which had rallied. Not long afterward, 200 Union reinforcements from the 1st Indiana Cavalry arrived plus two additional 3-inch Ordnance rifles. After an artillery barrage, Hovey organized another attack and after about 20 minutes of fighting, the Confederates fell back. Later, General William P. Benton&#x27;s brigade from the 1st Division reached the battlefield and continued the pursuit. The Confederate retreat toward Des Arc became a rout. That evening, the Confederates got across the lower crossing of the Cache River and destroyed their boats, preventing further pursuit.

==Results==

The Federals admitted losing six killed and 57 wounded during the action. They claimed to have killed 138 Confederates and 66 horses. One estimate gave Confederate losses as 250. Another source estimated a Confederate loss of 30 killed and 50–60 wounded. One Texan reported that the 12th Texas lost 14 killed, 20 seriously wounded, 16 slightly wounded, and two missing. He guessed that the 16th Texas lost about the same.

Curtis proceeded to Clarendon which his troops reached on July 9, only to find that the flotilla had departed the previous day. Fitch and Shirk were not able to make contact with Curtis&#x27;s army and would wait no longer. Curtis ordered cannons fired and sent couriers racing downstream, but the fleet disappeared downriver. Curtis had maintained a faint hope that he might renew his advance on Little Rock by basing on the White River. Now the Federal commander realized that resupplying his troops was the highest priority. Therefore, he turned his marching columns toward Helena which was about to the east. The Army of the Southwest occupied Helena without opposition on July 12 after a very difficult march in intense heat and clouds of dust. Union troops hailed passing transports in the Mississippi River and the army was soon resupplied. Curtis set up his headquarters in Hindman&#x27;s mansion. In mid-summer 1862, Federal military operations in the Western theater ground to a halt. For several months, Curtis&#x27;s troops remained unemployed while greedy cotton traders swarmed in Helena. The regiments from the Army of the Southwest were eventually absorbed into the Army of the Tennessee. Union forces held Helena for the duration of the war. On July 4, 1863, the Helena garrison repulsed an assault by Confederate forces in the Battle of Helena.

<text>Dame Olga Maria Elisabeth Friederike Schwarzkopf, (; 9 December 1915 – 3 August 2006) was a German-born Austro-British lyric soprano. She was among the foremost singers of lieder, and is renowned for her performances of Viennese operetta, as well as the operas of Mozart, Wagner and Richard Strauss. After retiring from the stage, she was a voice teacher internationally. She is considered one of the greatest sopranos of the 20th century.

==Early life==
Schwarzkopf was born on 9 December 1915 in Jarotschin in the Province of Posen in Prussia, Germany (now in Poland), to Friedrich Schwarzkopf and his wife, Elisabeth (). Schwarzkopf performed in her first opera in 1928, as Eurydice in a school production of Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; in Magdeburg, Germany. In 1934, Schwarzkopf began her musical studies at the Berlin Hochschule für Musik, where her singing tutor, Lula Mysz-Gmeiner, attempted to train her to be a mezzo-soprano. Schwarzkopf later trained under Maria Ivogün, and in 1938 joined the Deutsche Oper.

== Early career ==

In 1933, shortly after the Nazis came to power, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf&#x27;s father, a local school headmaster, was dismissed from his position by the new ruling authorities for having refused to allow a Nazi party meeting at his school. He was also banned from taking any new teaching post. Until Friedrich Schwarzkopf&#x27;s dismissal, the probability was that the 17-year-old Elisabeth would have studied medicine after passing her Abitur; but now, as the daughter of a banned school teacher, she was not allowed to enter university and she commenced music studies at the Berlin Hochschule für Musik. Schwarzkopf made her professional debut at the Deutsche Oper Berlin (then called Deutsches Opernhaus) on 15 April 1938, as the Second Flower Maiden (First Group) in act 2 of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;. In 1940 Schwarzkopf was awarded a full contract with the Deutsches Opernhaus, a condition of which was that she had to join the Nazi party.

Since the theme was brought up in the dissertation of the Austrian historian Oliver Rathkolb in 1982, the question of Schwarzkopf&#x27;s relationship with the Nazi Party has been discussed repeatedly in the media and in literature. There was criticism that Schwarzkopf, not only in the years immediately after the war but also in confrontation with revelations made in the 1980s and 1990s, made contradictory statements, including in regard to her membership in the NSDAP (Member No. 7,548,960). At first, she denied this and then with varying explanations defended it. In one version, for example, she claimed that she joined the party only at the insistence of her father who, himself, had earlier lost his position as school principal after forbidding a Nazi program in the school.

Further publications discussed her musical performances during the war before Nazi party conferences and for units of the Waffen-SS. Her defenders argue in favor of her claim that she always strictly separated art from politics and that she was a non-political person.

In 1942, she was invited to sing with the Vienna State Opera, where her roles included Konstanze in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, Musetta and later Mimì in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; and Violetta in Verdi&#x27;s&quot; La traviata&quot;.

Schwarzkopf sang four brief cameo roles in films produced by Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, but she was a voice, not a film star.

== Post-war career ==

In 1947, Schwarzkopf was granted Austrian citizenship to enable her to sing abroad with the Vienna State Opera. In 1947 and 1948, Schwarzkopf appeared on tour with the Vienna State Opera at London&#x27;s Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 16 September 1947 as Donna Elvira in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and at La Scala on 28 December 1948, as the Countess in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, which became one of her signature roles.

Schwarzkopf later made her official debut at the Royal Opera House on 16 January 1948, as Pamina in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, in performances sung in English, and at La Scala on 29 June 1950 singing Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa solemnis&quot;. Schwarzkopf&#x27;s association with the Milanese house in the early 1950s gave her the opportunity to sing certain roles on stage for the only time in her career: Mélisande in Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, Iole in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Hercules&quot;, Marguerite in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, Elsa in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, as well as her first Marschallin in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and her first Fiordiligi in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; at the Piccola Scala. On 11 September 1951, she appeared as Anne Trulove in the world premiere of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;. Schwarzkopf made her American concert debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on 28 and 29 October 1954, in Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Four Last Songs&quot; and the closing scene from &quot;Capriccio&quot; with Fritz Reiner conducting; her Carnegie Hall debut was a lied recital on 25 November 1956; her American opera debut was with the San Francisco Opera on 20 September 1955 as the Marschallin, and her debut at the Metropolitan Opera on 13 October 1964, also as the Marschallin.
In March 1946, Schwarzkopf was invited to audition for Walter Legge, an influential British classical record producer and a founder of the Philharmonia Orchestra. Legge asked her to sing Hugo Wolf&#x27;s lied &quot;Wer rief dich denn?&quot; and, impressed, signed her to an exclusive contract with EMI. They began a close partnership and Legge subsequently became Schwarzkopf&#x27;s manager and companion. They were married on 19 October 1953 in Epsom, Surrey; Schwarzkopf thus acquired British citizenship by marriage. Schwarzkopf would divide her time between lieder recitals and opera performances for the rest of her career. When invited in 1958 to select her eight favourite records on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, Schwarzkopf chose seven of her own recordings, and an eighth of Karajan conducting the &quot;Rosenkavalier&quot; prelude, as they evoked fond memories of the people she had worked with.

In the 1960s, Schwarzkopf concentrated nearly exclusively on five operatic roles: Donna Elvira in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, Countess Almaviva in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, Fiordiligi in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, Countess Madeleine in Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio&quot;, and the Marschallin. She was also well received as Alice Ford in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;. However, on the EMI label she made several &quot;champagne operetta&quot; recordings like Franz Lehár&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; and Johann Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;The Gypsy Baron&quot;.

Schwarzkopf&#x27;s last operatic performance was as the Marschallin on 31 December 1971, in the theatre of La Monnaie in Brussels. For the next several years, she devoted herself exclusively to lieder recitals. On 17 March 1979, Walter Legge suffered a severe heart attack. He disregarded doctor&#x27;s orders to rest and attended Schwarzkopf&#x27;s final recital two days later in Zurich. Three days later, he died.

==Retirement and death==

After retiring (almost immediately after her husband&#x27;s death), Schwarzkopf taught and gave master classes around the world, notably at the Juilliard School in New York City. After living in Ascona, Switzerland, for many years, she took up residence in Austria. She was made a doctor of music by the University of Cambridge in 1976, and became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1992.

Schwarzkopf died in her sleep during the night of 2–3 August 2006 at her home in Schruns, Vorarlberg, Austria, aged 90. Her ashes, and those of Walter Legge, were buried next to her parents in Zumikon near Zürich, where she had lived from 1982 to 2003.

==Legacy==
Her discography is considerable both in quality and in quantity and is distinguished for her Mozart and Richard Strauss operatic portrayals, her two commercial recordings of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Four Last Songs&quot; and her recordings of lieder, especially those of Wolf.

Schwarzkopf is generally considered to have been the greatest German lyric soprano of the twentieth century and one of the finest Mozart singers of all time with an &quot;indescribably beautiful&quot; voice.

Schwarzkopf&#x27;s entry in &quot;The Grove Book of Opera Singers&quot; concludes: &quot;Although she dismissed her [Nazi Party] membership as a professional necessity, her reputation has remained tarnished by what seems to have been an active party membership.&quot; Charles Scribner III, writing in The New Criterion, has defended Schwarzkopf&#x27;s party affiliation on the grounds that she was the daughter of an anti-Nazi dissident living in constant fear of the authorities.

==Quotations==

* &quot;(After being asked about Peter Sellars)&quot; &quot;There are names I do not want mentioned in my home. Do not say that name in my presence. I have seen what he has done, and it is criminal. As my husband used to say, so far no one has dared go into the Louvre Museum to spray graffiti on the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, but some opera directors are spraying graffiti over masterpieces.&quot; – &quot;Newsweek&quot; interview, 15 October 1990
* &quot;Many composers today don&#x27;t know what the human throat is. At Bloomington, Indiana, I was invited to listen to music written in quarter tones for four harps and voices. I had to go out to be sick.&quot; – &quot;Newsweek&quot; interview, 15 October 1990
* &quot;(Asked in 1995 if she would sing in the cultural climate of the 1990s if she were much younger)&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s a kind of prostitution now. There is nobody I envy. There&#x27;s a disintegration of integrity in our profession.&quot;

<doc id="379148" wikidata="Q234463" url="?curid=379148" title="Sydney Brenner">
<text>Sydney Brenner (13 January 1927 – 5 April 2019) was a South African biologist. In 2002, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with H. Robert Horvitz and Sir John E. Sulston. Brenner made significant contributions to work on the genetic code, and other areas of molecular biology while working in the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. He established the roundworm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; as a model organism for the investigation of developmental biology, and founded the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley, California, United States.

==Education and early life==

Brenner was born in the town of Germiston in the then Transvaal (today in Gauteng), South Africa, on 13 January 1927. His parents, Leah (née Blecher) and Morris Brenner, were Jewish immigrants. His father, a cobbler, came to South Africa from Lithuania in 1910, and his mother from Riga, Latvia, in 1922. He had one sister, Phyllis.

He was educated at Germiston High School and the University of the Witwatersrand. Having joined the university at the age of 15, it was noted during his second year that he would be too young to qualify for the practice of medicine at the conclusion of his six-year medical course, and he was therefore allowed to complete a Bachelor of Science degree in Anatomy and Physiology. During this time he was taught physical chemistry by Joel Mandelstam, microscopy by Alfred Oettle and neurology by Harold Daitz. He also received an introduction to anthropology and paleontology from Raymond Dart and Robert Broom. The histologist Joseph Gillman and director of research in the Anatomy Department persuaded Brenner to continue towards an honours degree and beyond towards an MSc. Brenner accepted though this would mean he would not graduate from medical school and his bursary would be discontinued. He supported himself during this time by working as a laboratory technician. It was during this time, in 1945, that Brenner would publish his first scientific works. His masters thesis was in the field of cytogenetics and publications during this time in the field Brenner would later call Cell Physiology.

In 1946 Wilfred Le Gros Clark invited Brenner to his Department of Anatomy in Oxford, during a visit to South Africa. Brenner was persuaded to finish his medical education instead. Brenner returned to medical school where he failed Medicine, nearly failed Surgery and achieved a First Class in Obstetrics and Gynecology. Six months later Brenner had finished repeating Medicine and Surgery and in 1951 received the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBCh).

Brenner received an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 which enabled him to complete a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree at the University of Oxford as a postgraduate student of Exeter College, Oxford, supervised by Cyril Hinshelwood.

==Career and research==

Following his DPhil, Brenner did postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley. He spent the next 20 years at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. There, during the 1960s, he contributed to molecular biology, then an emerging field. In 1976 he joined the Salk Institute in California.

Together with Jack Dunitz, Dorothy Hodgkin, Leslie Orgel, and Beryl M. Oughton, he was one of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of DNA, constructed by Francis Crick and James Watson; at the time he and the other scientists were working at the University of Oxford&#x27;s Chemistry Department. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner, who subsequently worked with Crick in the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge and the newly opened Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB). According to Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Dorothy Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA.

Brenner made several seminal contributions to the emerging field of molecular biology in the 1960s (see Phage group). The first was to prove that all overlapping genetic coding sequences were impossible. This insight separated the coding function from structural constraints as proposed in a clever code by George Gamow. This led Francis Crick to propose the concept of a hypothetical molecule (later identified as transfer RNA or tRNA) that transfer the genetic information from RNA to proteins. Brenner gave the name &quot;adaptor hypothesis&quot; in 1955. The physical separation between the anticodon and the amino acid on a tRNA is the basis for the unidirectional flow of information in coded biological systems. This is commonly known as the central dogma of molecular biology, i.e. information flows from nucleic acid to protein and never from protein to nucleic acid. Following this adaptor insight, Brenner conceived of the concept of messenger RNA during an April 1960 conversation with Crick and François Jacob, and together with Jacob and Matthew Meselson went on to prove its existence later that summer. Then, with Crick, Leslie Barnett, and Richard J. Watts-Tobin, Brenner genetically demonstrated the triplet nature of the code of protein translation through the Crick, Brenner, Barnett, Watts-Tobin et al. experiment of 1961, which discovered frameshift mutations. Brenner collaborating with Sarabhai, Stretton and Bolle in 1964, using amber mutants defective in the bacteriophage T4D major head protein, showed that the nucleotide sequence of the gene is co-linear with the amino acid sequence of the encoded polypeptide chain.

Together with the decoding work of Marshall Warren Nirenberg and others, the discovery of the triplet nature of the genetic code was critical to deciphering the code. Barnett helped set up Sydney Brenner&#x27;s laboratory in Singapore, many years later.

Brenner, with George Pieczenik, created the first computer matrix analysis of nucleic acids using TRAC, which Brenner continued to use. Crick, Brenner, Klug and Pieczenik returned to their early work on deciphering the genetic code with a pioneering paper on the origin of protein synthesis, where constraints on mRNA and tRNA co-evolved allowing for a five-base interaction with a flip of the anticodon loop, and thereby creating a triplet code translating system without requiring a ribosome. This model requires a partially overlapping code. The published scientific paper is extremely rare in that its collaborators include three authors who independently became Nobel laureates.

Brenner then focused on establishing a free-living roundworm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; as a model organism for the investigation of animal development including neural development. He chose this 1-millimeter-long soil roundworm mainly because it is simple, is easy to grow in bulk populations, and turned out to be quite convenient for genetic analysis. One of the key methods for identifying important function genes was the screen for roundworms that had some functional defect, such as being &quot;uncoordinated&quot;, leading to the identification of new sets of proteins, such as the UNC proteins. For this work, he shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with H. Robert Horvitz and John Sulston. The title of his Nobel lecture in December 2002, &quot;Nature&#x27;s Gift to Science&quot;, is a homage to this nematode; in it, he considered that having chosen the right organism turned out to be as important as having addressed the right problems to work on. In fact, the &quot;C. elegans&quot; community has grown rapidly in recent decades with researchers working on a wide spectrum of problems.

Brenner founded the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley, California in 1996. he was associated with the Salk Institute, the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, the Singapore Biomedical Research Council, the Janelia Farm Research Campus, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. In August 2005, Brenner was appointed president of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology. He was also on the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute, as well as being Professor of Genetics there. A scientific biography of Brenner was written by Errol Friedberg in the US, for publication by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press in 2010.

Known for his penetrating scientific insight and acerbic wit, Brenner, for many years, authored a regular column (&quot;Loose Ends&quot;) in the journal &quot;Current Biology&quot;. This column was so popular that &quot;Loose ends from Current Biology&quot;, a compilation, was published by Current Biology Ltd. and became a collectors&#x27; item. Brenner wrote &quot;A Life in Science&quot;, a paperback published by BioMed Central. He is also noted for his generosity with ideas and the great number of students and colleagues his ideas have stimulated.

In 2017, Brenner co-organized a seminal lecture series in Singapore describing ten logarithmic scales of time from the Big Bang to the present, spanning the appearance of multicellular life forms, the evolution of humans, and the emergence of language, culture and technology. Prominent scientists and thinkers, including W. Brian Arthur, Svante Pääbo, Helga Nowotny and Jack Szostak, spoke during the lecture series. In 2018, the lectures were adapted into a popular science book titled &quot;Sydney Brenner&#x27;s 10-on-10: The Chronicles of Evolution&quot;, published by Wildtype Books.

Brenner also gave four lectures on the history of molecular biology, its impact on neuroscience and the great scientific questions that lie ahead. The lectures were adapted into the book, &quot;In the Spirit of Science: Lectures by Sydney Brenner on DNA, Worms and Brains&quot;.

===American plan and European plan===

The &quot;American plan&quot; and &quot;European plan&quot; were proposed by Sydney Brenner as competing models for the way brain cells determine their neural functions. According to the European plan (sometimes referred to as the British plan), the function of cells is determined by their genetic lineage. According to the American plan, a cell&#x27;s function is determined by the function of its neighbours after cell migration. Further research has shown that most species follow some combination of these methods, albeit in varying degrees, to transfer information to new cells.

<doc id="379153" wikidata="Q1052496" url="?curid=379153" title="Subplot">
<text>In fiction, a subplot or side story is a strand of the plot that is a supporting side story for any story or for the main plot. Subplots may connect to main plots, in either time and place or thematic significance. Subplots often involve supporting characters, those besides the protagonist or antagonist. Subplots may also intertwine with the main plot at some point in a story. 

An example of a subplot interacting with a main plot can be found in the TV series &quot;Mr. Robot&quot; (season 1). One of the main plots followed the hacker ring known as F-society, led by Elliot Alderson, where they intended to perform a massive hack against the conglomerate Evil Corp; they were executing this hack through a partnership with another hack-ring known as The Dark Army. A subplot emerged around the character development of Elliot&#x27;s childhood friend and love interest Angela Moss where she evolved from a brow-beaten assistant at cybersecurity firm Allsafe into a powerbroker at Evil Corp through first leading a massive lawsuit against them. During an early point of this subplot, Angela Moss is blackmailed by The Dark Army into installing spyware (surveillance malware) into an Allsafe computer (the cybersecurity firm responsible for protecting Evil Corp). The result of her action in this subplot ended up affecting the main plot when F-society was ready to initiate the hack against Evil Corp. The Dark Army decided to back out from participating in the hack because of information they learned as a result of Angela Moss installing the spyware. Without The Dark Army&#x27;s support, F-society was unable to initiate the hack and had to realign their strategy, thus introducing a new obstacle in the main plot that had to be overcome. Throughout the story, her subplot repeatedly affected this main plot. 

Subplots are distinguished from the main plot by taking up less of the action, having fewer significant events occur, with less impact on the &quot;world&quot; of the work, and occurring to less important characters.

In screenwriting, a subplot is referred to as a &quot;B story&quot; while the main plot point can be referred to as the &quot;A story&quot;.

<text>Brackley is a market town and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, in Northamptonshire, England, bordering Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, from Oxford and from Northampton. Historically a market town based on the wool and lace trade, it was built on the intersecting trade routes between London, Birmingham, the Midlands, Cambridge and Oxford. Brackley is close to Silverstone and home to the Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team. In 2021 the parish had a population of 16,195.

==History==
The place-name &#x27;Brackley&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Brachelai&quot;. It appears as &quot;Brackelea&quot; in 1173 and as &quot;Brackeley&quot; in 1230 in the Pipe Rolls. The name means &#x27;Bracca&#x27;s glade or clearing&#x27;. Brackley was held in 1086 by Earl Alberic, after which it passed to the Earl of Leicester, and to the families of De Quincy and Roland.

In the 11th and 12th centuries Brackley was in the Hundred of Odboldistow and in the Manor of Halse. Richard I (The Lionheart) named five official sites for jousting tournaments so that such events could not be used as local wars, and Brackley was one of these. The tournament site is believed to be to the south of the castle where the A422 now passes.

The town was the site of an important meeting between the barons and representatives of the King in 1215, the year of Magna Carta. Magna Carta required King John to proclaim rights, respect laws and accept that the King&#x27;s wishes were subject to law. It explicitly protected certain rights of the King&#x27;s subjects, whether freemen, serfs, slaves or prisoners—most notably allowing appeal against unlawful imprisonment. King John and the barons were to have signed Magna Carta at Brackley Castle, but they eventually did so at Runnymede.

Market day was on Sundays until 1218, when it was changed to Wednesdays. It is now on Friday mornings.

The Tudor antiquary John Leland visited Brackley, where he learned &#x27;a Lord of the Towne&#x27; named Neville had (at an uncertain point in the past) had the parish vicar murdered. This he had done by having the man buried alive. The writer Daniel Codd observed that in the grounds of St Peter&#x27;s Church, a human-shaped stone effigy is sometimes pointed out as being connected with the event.

In 1597 the town was incorporated by Elizabeth I. It had a mayor, six aldermen and 26 burgesses.

In 1602, the metaphysical poet John Donne was elected as Member of Parliament for the constituency of Brackley.

Brackley used to be known for wool and lace-making.

It had 20 houses in the 18th century. In August 1882 the Brackley Lawn Tennis Club organised the Brackley LTC Tournament, as part of the Brackley Show.

In 1901 the population of the town was 2,467.

From 1974 to 2021 it was in South Northamptonshire district.

===Brackley Poor Law Union===
Brackley used the poor house at Culworth until 1834, when Parliament passed the Poor Law Amendment Act and as a result Brackley Poor Law Union was founded. A workhouse for 250 people was built in 1836, southwest of the town on Banbury Road. It was demolished in the 1930s.

==Notable buildings==

===Castle===
Brackley Castle was built soon after 1086. Its earthwork remains lie between Hinton Road and Tesco. It comprised a motte mound high and approximately in diameter with an outer bailey to the east. Archaeological excavation has revealed evidence of a ditch defining the perimeter of the bailey. Two fishponds originally lay outside the ditch but have subsequently been infilled – however south of St. James Lake may have formed a part of this. Brackley Castle may have gone out of use in 1147. It was destroyed between 1173 (when the then lord of the manor, the Earl of Leicester, Robert le Blancmain, fell out with Henry II) and 1217 (when the Earl of Winchester, Blancmain&#x27;s heir, was on the losing side against Henry III during the First Barons&#x27; War. The site was later granted to the Hospital of SS. James and John.

===Parish church===

The oldest part of the Church of England parish church of Saint Peter at the eastern end of the town centre is an 11th-century Norman south doorway. Both the four-bay arcade of the south aisle and the west tower with its niches containing seated statues were added in the 13th century. Next the chancel was rebuilt, probably late in the 13th century. The north arcade and the windows in both the north and south aisles were probably added early in the 14th century, about the same time as the Decorated Gothic chapel was added to the chancel.

===Medieval hospitals===
In about 1150 Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester founded the Hospital of St. James and St. John. Its master was a priest, assisted by a number of religious brothers. Its duties included providing accommodation and care for poor travellers. In the 15th century there were complaints that successive masters were absentees, holding other livings at the same time as being in charge of the hospital. The hospital was closed in 1423 for maladministration but re-established in 1425. In 1449 a master was appointed who seems to have continued the practice of non-residence while holding parish livings elsewhere. In 1484 the patron, Viscount Lovell granted control of the hospital to William Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester, citing its failure to give hospitality and alms.

Waynflete had founded Magdalen College, Oxford in 1458 and Magdalen College School, Oxford in 1480. He made the former hospital part of their property and by 1548 it was Magdalen College School, Brackley. St James&#x27; chapel became the school chapel, in which use it remains today. It is the oldest building in Great Britain in continuous use by a school. The oldest part of the chapel is the west doorway, which is late Norman. Most of its windows are slightly later, being Early English Gothic lancet windows. The trio of stepped lancets above the west doorway are late 13th century. The Gothic Revival architect Charles Buckeridge restored the chapel in 1869–70.

The Hospital of St. Leonard was a smaller institution, founded to care for lepers. It was from SS. James and John, apparently on the northern edge of Brackley. It was in existence by 1280. After 1417 it shared the same master as SS. James and John and thereafter there is no separate record of St. Leonard&#x27;s, so the larger hospital may have taken it over. No buildings of St. Leonard&#x27;s hospital have survived.

===Secular buildings===

The almshouses were founded in 1633 by Sir Thomas Crewe of Steane. They have one storey plus attic dormers. They were originally six houses but by 1973 they had been converted into four apartments.

Brackley Manor House was also a 17th-century Jacobean building that also originally had one storey plus attic dormers. In 1875–78 the Earl of Ellesmere had it rebuilt on a larger scale, in the same style but retaining only the doorway and one window of the original building. It is now Winchester House School, a coeducational preparatory school for children aged from 3–13. It used to be a Woodard School.

Brackley Town Hall is Georgian, built in 1706 by the 4th Earl of Bridgewater. The ground floor was originally open but has since been enclosed. Market Place and Bridge Street feature number of other early 18th-century houses and inns, mostly of brick and in several cases combining red and blue bricks in a chequer pattern.

The town park belongs to the National Trust and hosts the Folk in the Park festival.

==Transport==

===Roads and buses===
Brackley is close to the A43 road, which bypasses the town and links it to Towcester and Northampton to the north-east and the M40 motorway to the west. The A422 links it to Banbury and Buckingham.

The town has numerous bus services and is connected to other towns and cities including Banbury (499, 500), Bicester (505), Buckingham (131, 132), Towcester, Oxford and Northampton (88).

===Railways===
There are no railways stations in Brackley - the nearest stations are at , about west of the town and Banbury, around away. A bus service links Brackley town centre to Banbury station. Brackley had two railway stations but these were closed in the 1960s.

Brackley&#x27;s first station, known in its latter years as Brackley Town, opened in May 1850 as part of the Buckinghamshire Railway&#x27;s Buckingham and Brackley Junction line between and &quot;via&quot; . The London and North Western Railway operated the line from the beginning and absorbed the Buckinghamshire Railway Company in 1879. British Railways withdrew passenger trains from the line through Brackley Town station in January 1961 and closed the line to freight in 1966.

Brackley&#x27;s second station was , opened in March 1899 on the Great Central Main Line, which was the last main line to be built between northern England and London. The GC Main Line included Brackley Viaduct across the Ouse Valley southeast of the town, which was in length, high, had 20 brick arches and two girder spans. British Railways withdrew passenger trains from the line through Brackley Central in September 1966. Brackley Viaduct was demolished in sections early in 1978.

Chiltern Railways is said to want to restore services between and Rugby along the former Great Central Main Line. This would have Brackley Central railway station reopen with direct services to London, and Rugby. However, the Department for Transport has chosen part of the former Great Central route north-west of Brackley as part of the new High Speed 2 line between London and Birmingham. A station at Brackley is not currently proposed.

==Industry==
Brackley is near the Silverstone motor racing circuit, and has some industry related to Formula One racing, notably Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team (formerly Brawn GP, Honda, British American Racing and Tyrrell) which is based in the town, and the Aston Martin F1 team which operates a wind tunnel on the former site of the north railway station yard.

==Morris dancing==
The Brackley Morris Men are one of only seven &#x27;traditional Cotswold&#x27; sides remaining in England, and the only one to survive in Northamptonshire. Their history dates back to the 1600s when a solid silver communion plate was given to the parish. The plate which is still in the possession of St Peter&#x27;s Church is dated 1623, and is inscribed with the names of seven men, whom local folklore believes to have been the Morris dancers. In 1725 the men were paid half a guinea to dance at the Whitsun Ale at Aynho House. In 1766 their &#x27;Squire&#x27; was arrested in Oxford for his insolence and committed to Bridewell as a vagrant. In 1866 an article in the &quot;Oxford Chronicle&quot; reported on their performance in Banbury, describing their &#x27;many coloured ribbons and other gaudy finery&#x27;, and the &#x27;witless buffoonery&#x27; of their &#x27;fool&#x27;. The side still performs today.

<text>The Soft Parade is the fourth studio album by American rock band the Doors, released on July 18, 1969, by Elektra Records. Most of the album was recorded following a grueling tour during which the band was left with little time to compose new material. Record producer Paul A. Rothchild recommended a total departure from the Doors&#x27; first three albums: develop a fuller sound by incorporating brass and string arrangements provided by Paul Harris. Lead singer Jim Morrison, who was dealing with personal issues and focusing more on his poetry, was less involved in the songwriting process, allowing guitarist Robby Krieger to increase his own creative output.

The album peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but it failed to retain audiences in the UK and other European countries that their previous album, &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot;, had succeeded in engaging. Three preceding singles, &quot;Touch Me&quot;, &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot;, and &quot;Tell All the People&quot;, were included on &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;, with the former becoming another Top 10 hit for the Doors. Another single, &quot;Runnin&#x27; Blue&quot;, also followed the album&#x27;s distribution. Upon release, &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; was denounced by both music critics and the band&#x27;s underground music scene followers, who viewed the album as the Doors&#x27; trending into popular music. Over time, historians have reassessed the album and its critical standing has slightly improved, but it is still widely considered to be the group&#x27;s weakest effort with Morrison.

== Background ==

By mid-1968, the Doors had established themselves as one of the most popular groups in the US. The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot;, released in July of the same year, became the Doors&#x27; only number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 while also spawning &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot;, their second number one single. The album was the first commercial breakthrough for the band in the UK, reaching number 16 on the UK Albums Chart. After the release of &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot;, the Doors commanded substantial performance fees and played before large crowds in arenas such as the L.A. Forum, the Hollywood Bowl, and Madison Square Garden. Additionally, local Los Angeles Top 40 radio stations, KHJ Radio in particular, which had previously refused to play the band&#x27;s records, began sponsoring the Doors&#x27; live performances. Initial sessions for the album occurred on July 26, 1968 when the band recorded &quot;Wild Child&quot; and &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot; (&quot;Easy Ride&quot; was a &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; leftover, captured on March 3, 1968). In September 1968, the group played dates in Europe, along with Jefferson Airplane, before ending their long, grueling touring schedule with nine concerts back in the US. While the 1968 tours managed to capitalize on the chart success of &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot;, it also left little time for the Doors to compose new songs for &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;, having already exhausted all the material from Morrison&#x27;s songbooks.

Throughout 1968, Morrison&#x27;s behavior became increasingly erratic: he began drinking heavily and distanced himself from studio work to focus on his more immediate passions, poetry and film making. At the time, Morrison was also struggling with anxiety, and felt like he was on the brink of a nervous breakdown. He considered quitting the Doors, but was persuaded by keyboardist Ray Manzarek to finish recording &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; before making such a decision.

In November 1968, the band entered the newly established studio Elektra Sound West on La Cienega Boulevard to continue work on &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;, a process that was not completed until May 1969. Without any album-ready material to work with, record producer Paul A. Rothchild took control of the recording sessions and insisted on numerous retakes of songs, much to the group&#x27;s indignation. &quot;It was like pulling teeth to get Jim into it&quot;, sound engineer Bruce Botnick recalled. &quot;It was bizarre ... the hardest I ever worked as a producer.&quot; Rothchild, who by this time was addicted to cocaine and incredibly strict in his leadership, caused severe strife in the studio, especially with his advisor Jac Holzman, who argued that the drive for perfection was &quot;grinding them [The Doors] into the ground&quot;. The album was by far the most expensive by the group, costing US$80,000 to create in contrast to the US$10,000 required for their debut.

== Music ==

The Doors wanted to redefine what could be accomplished within the rock medium. Looking for a new, creative sound, Rothchild hired Paul Harris to arrange string and orchestral arrangements for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and local jazz horn players. Session musicians Doug Lubahn and Harvey Brooks also served as additional bass guitarists. The music on &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; incorporated psychedelic rock, blues rock, art rock, jazz rock, pop rock and experimental styles. Drummer John Densmore and Manzarek, who both had jazz backgrounds, asserted they were receptive to Rothchild&#x27;s jazz concept: &quot;We&#x27;d [Densmore and Manzarek] always talk about using some jazz musicianslet&#x27;s put some horns and strings on, man, let&#x27;s see what it would be like to record with a string section and a big horn section,&quot; recalled Manzarek.

Although Morrison was less involved in the Doors&#x27; studio sessions at this point, he demanded the band receive individual writing credits after initially refusing to sing Krieger&#x27;s lyric, &quot;Can&#x27;t you see me growing, get your guns&quot; on the track &quot;Tell All the People&quot;. As a result, &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; was the first Doors album to list band members separately rather than collectively as &quot;Songs by the Doors.&quot; Krieger continued to hone his songwriting skills to fill the void left by Morrison&#x27;s absence. He wrote half of the album&#x27;s tracks, while Morrison is credited with the other half (they share co-credits on &quot;Do It&quot;), ultimately creating an album that lacks the unified musical stance found in the Doors&#x27; early works.

Krieger&#x27;s songs, written almost independently from the rest of the band, most noticeably incorporated the jazz influences. Only his tracks, &quot;Tell All the People&quot;, &quot;Touch Me&quot;, &quot;Runnin&#x27; Blue&quot;, and &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot;, were written to include string and horn arrangements; Morrison, though not totally opposed to the concept, declined to go in the direction Densmore and Manzarek championed. &quot;Touch Me&quot; (penned under the working titles &quot;Hit Me&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Love You&quot;) was chosen as the first single taken from &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;, becoming one of the Doors&#x27; biggest hits. The band brought in the saxophone player Curtis Amy to perform a solo instrumental on the song, which was influenced by the works of John Coltrane.

Journalists Nathan Brackett and Christian Hoard found &quot;Wild Child&quot; as &quot;Morrison parodying himself.&quot; &quot;Shaman&#x27;s Blues&quot; and the title track were both examples of the singer&#x27;s penchant for using symbolism and autobiographical insights. The latter song, a stylistic return to a lengthy track closing a Doors album, was penned with the help of Rothchild, who organized pieces of Morrison&#x27;s poetry with him to align rhythmically and conceptually. Introduced with a mock-fiery sermon by Morrison, &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; displays his Southern roots through his portrayal as a preacher. The song&#x27;s ambiance is heightened by the striking imagery which outlines a need for sanctuary, escape, and pleasure. Critic Doug Sundling noted that &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;, with its display of funk, jazz, acid rock and psychedelic pop influences, is more diverse than any other composition of the group.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;The Soft Parade&quot; was released on July 18, 1969. It peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, during a chart stay of 28 weeks, but fared poorly in the UK where the album failed to reach the charts. The album&#x27;s front cover photograph was taken by Joel Brodsky, who had also been responsible for the cover of the Doors&#x27; debut album and &quot;Strange Days&quot;. Three singles had already been released prior to the album&#x27;s distribution, much more than usual for a Doors album. The &quot;Touch Me&quot; single was released in December 1968 and became one of the band&#x27;s biggest hits, reaching number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Two additional singles, &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot; and &quot;Tell All the People&quot;, were also distributed but fared less favorably, peaking at numbers 44 and 57 respectively. Following the release of &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;, the Doors earned another minor hit with the &quot;Runnin&#x27; Blue&quot; single, charting at number 64 upon its release in August 1969.
The album was rejected by the group&#x27;s original audience and the underground scene, particularly for the use of horns and strings. The underground press was less than complimentary, with David Walkey, writing in New York&#x27;s &quot;East Village Other&quot;, stating the album was &quot;badly messed up by the syrupy arrangement of Paul Rothchild and could be renamed, &#x27;The Rothchild Strings Play the Doors&#x27;.&quot; Another scathing review by Miller Francis Jr. of &quot;The Great Speckled Bird&quot; expressed disdain for the Doors&#x27; attempt at art rock, feeling &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; &quot;comes on so pretentious, like something written rather than something sung.&quot; Rob Cline of &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; questioned why a band like the Doors needed to record with violins and trombones when the group was &quot;best when getting it on straight and hard as witness to their first two albums&quot;. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Alec Dubro found much of the songs to be &quot;pale shadows of their earlier works&quot;. &quot;Jazz and Pop&quot; magazine analyst Patricia Keneally, on the other hand, praised the band&#x27;s experimentation, claiming, &quot;most of it is very superior music and some is absolutely glorious&quot;. Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in January 1970, Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;This is an acceptable record, with predictable pretensions and two or three first-rate songs (&#x27;Touch Me,&#x27; &#x27;Wild Child&#x27;). Nothing to get excited about, either way.&quot;

Writer Richard Riegel evaluated the immediate impact of &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; on the Doors&#x27; reputation in the magazine &quot;Creem&quot; in 1981: &quot;If &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; set a lot of older hippies to questioning their former perceptions of the Doors as Avatars of the avant-garde, then &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; finished off their interest in the group.&quot; In a review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger was slightly more positive, writing that &quot;about half the record is quite good, especially the huge hit &#x27;Touch Me&#x27; (their most successful integration of orchestration)&quot;. However, Unterberger felt it is the &quot;weakest studio album recorded with Jim Morrison&quot;, as well as &quot;their weakest set of material, low lights including filler like &#x27;Do It&#x27; and &#x27;Runnin&#x27; Blue&#x27;.&quot; Writer James Riordan opined that, compared to prior albums, Morrison&#x27;s contributions to &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; were lackluster, putting his credibility as a serious poet and songwriter on the line. Author Danny Sugerman in &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot; wrote &quot;overall the lyric impact was less than it had been on previous albums... horns by some of the top local studio jazz musicians further blurred the once-lucid Doors sound&quot;. &quot;MusicHound Rock&quot; editors Gary Graff and Daniel Durcholz described the album as &quot;uneven&quot;, but also expressed that it &quot;tends toward the great and includes some of the band&#x27;s most ambitious, original material.&quot;

=== Reissues ===
In 1988, &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; was digitally remastered by Bruce Botnick and Paul A. Rothchild at Digital Magnetics, using the original master tapes. It was remastered again in 1999 for &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; box set by Bernie Grundman and Botnick at Bernie Grundman Mastering, using 96khz/24bit technology; it was also released as a standalone CD release. In 2006, the album was reissued on a CD/DVD set featuring the 2006 stereo and 5.1 remixes done by Botnick for the &quot;Perception&quot; box set, and it includes a clip of the Doors performing the title track live. The 2006 stereo remix was also released on a standalone CD release in 2007 with six bonus tracks including the rarities &quot;Whisky, Mystics, and Men&quot; and &quot;Push Push&quot;; this edition was mastered by Botnick at Uniteye. In 2009, it was reissued on 180g vinyl featuring the original mix, which was cut by Grundman. The same year, Audio Fidelity reissued the album on 24kt gold CD, remastered by Steve Hoffman. However, this edition was criticized due to the use of limiting and compression applied during mastering, despite it being advertised as maintaining the original dynamic range of the recording.

Analogue Productions reissued the album on hybrid SACD (2013) and double 45 RPM vinyl (2012); both editions were mastered by Doug Sax and Sangwook Nam at The Mastering Lab. The CD layer of the Super Audio CD contains the original stereo mix while the SACD layer contains Botnick&#x27;s 2006 5.1 surround mix. In 2019, Rhino Records released a 1-LP/3-CD deluxe edition to commemorate the album&#x27;s 50th anniversary release, which was remastered by Botnick, utilizing the Plangent Process. The CDs are encoded with MQA technology. It included the namely &quot;Doors only&quot; versions of &quot;Tell All the People&quot;, &quot;Touch Me&quot;, &quot;Runnin&#x27; Blue&quot; and &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot;, where the orchestral arrangements are removed and features some new overdubbed guitar parts by Krieger.

== Track listing ==
The 40th Anniversary edition includes a longer version of &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;, running to over 9:41 length. However, the liner notes of the original US Elektra Records album released on July 18, 1969, show the details as listed below:

<doc id="379174" wikidata="Q62511" url="?curid=379174" title="Amalia of Solms-Braunfels">
<text>Amalia of Solms-Braunfels (31 August 1602 – 8 September 1675) was Princess of Orange by marriage to Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. She acted as the political adviser of her spouse during his reign, and acted as his de facto deputy and regent during his infirmity from 1640 to 1647. She also served as chair of the regency council during the minority of her grandson William III, Prince of Orange from 1650 until 1672.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Amalia was born in Braunfels as a fourth daughter of Imperial Count Johann Albrecht I of Solms-Braunfels (1563-1623) and his wife, Countess Agnes of Sayn-Wittgenstein (1568-1617). She was a member of the House of Solms, a ruling family with Imperial immediacy, and spent her childhood at Braunfels Castle.

She became part of the court of Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, wife of Frederick V of the Palatine, the &quot;Winter King&quot; of Bohemia. After imperial forces defeated Frederick V, she fled from Prague with the pregnant queen to the west. Shelter was denied to them along the way because the emperor forbade it as Frederick had been placed under an Imperial ban. Elizabeth went into labour during their flight and Amalia helped her with her delivery of Prince Maurice at Küstrin castle.

The end of their journey was The Hague, where stadtholder Maurice, Prince of Orange, uncle of the elector gave them asylum in 1621. They often appeared at his court, where Maurice&#x27;s younger half-brother Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange became infatuated with Amalia in 1622. She refused to become his lover and held out for marriage. The two were closely related, in particular, first cousins once removed.

When Maurice of Nassau died, he made his half-brother Frederick Henry promise to wed. Frederick married Amalia on 4 April 1625.

===Wife to the Stadtholder===

When Frederick Henry became stadtholder after the death of his half-brother Prince Maurice, his influence grew substantially, as did Amalia&#x27;s. Together Frederick Henry and Amalia succeeded in expanding court life in The Hague. They had several palaces built, including Huis ten Bosch. Amalia was a great collector of art and amassed many jewels, which were inherited by her four surviving daughters. She was described as intelligent, arrogant and ambitious, not beautiful but with a fresh and appealing appearance.

Amalia was the prime mover of several royal marriages, including that of her son William III to Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange (daughter of King Charles I of England) and of their daughters with several German princes.

The relationship between Amalia and Frederik Hendrik was described as happy, and Amalia is acknowledged to have acted as his political adviser. From 1640 until his death in 1647, Frederik Hendrik&#x27;s health (he suffered from gout and probably also from a form of Alzheimer&#x27;s) made it increasingly difficult for him to participate in politics, and during these seven years, Amalia therefore effectively functioned as regent and stadtholder, maintaining diplomatic contacts and making political decisions on his behalf. Her &quot;de facto&quot; political position was acknowledged and diplomats, aware of this, tried to influence her decisions by costly presents. It was reportedly Amalia who was behind Frederik Hendrik&#x27;s participation in the negotiations which was eventually to result in the Peace of Münster of 1648. As a recognition, King Philip IV of Spain granted her the seigniory and castle of Turnhout in 1649.

In 1647, her spouse died and was succeeded as stadtholder and Prince of Orange by their son William II, Prince of Orange.

=== Regency ===
After the death of her son William II in 1650, her grandson William III (Prince William III of Orange and later also King William III of England) became prince of Orange. A regency council was appointed during his minority, and Amalia and her former daughter-in-law Mary Stuart fought over guardianship and thereby chairmanship of the regency council; the High Court of Holland and Zeeland finally granted both Mary and Amalia shared guardianship, and thereby shared part in the regency council of Orange.

Amalia was supported against Mary by her son-in-law, the Elector of Brandenburg, and she was on good terms with the Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt, a relationship which did not change with the Act of Seclusion of 1654, barring the prince from all ancestral offices. When Mary died in 1660, Amalia in practice took sole control of the regency of her grandson. She maintained good relations to De Witt even by the passing of the 1667 Eternal Edict, which abolished the office of stadholder entirely. During this time she lived in the Oude Hof on the Noordeinde, maintaining her court and diplomatic contacts with royalty.

In 1672, her grandson was declared an adult and his regency council thereby dismissed. Amalia retired and witnessed him becoming stadholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel and captain-general of the Union. She died at her home in The Hague, aged 73.

== Tributes ==

A wine from wine estate Solms-Delta in Franschhoek (South Africa) is named after Amalia of Solms-Braunfels. The wine honours the role played by her in Dutch political life. Her grandson, William III, King of England, provided refuge and support to thousands of French Huguenots after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Some 180 of these refugees, fleeing religious persecution, were relocated to the Cape and granted farms in Franschhoek. Here they laid the foundations of the modern South African wine industry.

<text>The Lost Princess of Oz is the eleventh book in the Oz series written by L. Frank Baum. Published on June 5, 1917, it begins with the disappearance of Princess Ozma, the ruler of Oz and covers Dorothy and the Wizard&#x27;s efforts to find her. The introduction to the novel states that its inspiration was a letter a young girl had written to Baum: &quot;I suppose if Ozma ever got hurt or losted , everybody would be sorry.&quot; It was followed by &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; (1918).

The Frogman and Cayke&#x27;s dishpan re-appear in Jeff Freedman&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;The Magic Dishpan of Oz&quot;.

==Plot==

Dorothy has risen from bed for the day and is seeing to her friends in the Emerald City and notices that Ozma has not awakened yet. Dorothy goes into Ozma&#x27;s chambers only to find she is not there.

Glinda awakens in her palace in the Quadling Country and finds her Great Book of Records and magic tools are missing. She dispatches a messenger to the Emerald City to relay news of the theft. Receiving the news, the Wizard hastily offers his magic tools to assist Glinda, however, these are missing as well. Glinda, Dorothy, and the Wizard organize search parties to find Ozma and the missing magic. Accompanying them are Button-Bright, Trot, and Betsy Bobbin. Dorothy and the Wizard&#x27;s party begins to search the Winkie Country to the west of the Emerald City.

Meanwhile, in the southwestern corner of the Winkie Country on a plateau belonging to the Yips, Cayke the cookie cook has had her magic gold dishpan stolen. The self-proclaimed adviser to the Yips, a human-sized dandy of a frog called the Frogman, hears Cayke&#x27;s story and offers to help her find the dishpan. 

Dorothy, the Wizard, and their party enter the previously unknown communities of Thi and Herku. In the Great Orchard between Thi and Herku, Button-Bright eats from the one peach tree in the orchard, and discovers that the peach pit is made of gold. 

In the city of Herku, Dorothy and the Wizard&#x27;s party are greeted by the emaciated but jovial Czarover of Herku, who has invented a pure energy compound called &quot;zosozo&quot; that can make his people strong enough to keep giants as slaves. The Czarover gives them a clue that Ugu the Shoemaker might be behind all the recent thefts of magic and the ruler of Oz. They proceed from Herku toward the castle and meet with Cayke and her companions.

When the combined party arrives at Ugu&#x27;s castle, they overcome Ugu&#x27;s magical defenses and confront the thief. Dorothy uses the magic belt to turn Ugu into a dove, but he modifies the enchantment so he retains human size and aggressive nature. Fighting his way past Dorothy and her companions, Ugu the dove uses Cayke&#x27;s diamond-studded dishpan to flee to the Quadling Country.

Once the magic tools are recovered, the conquering search party turns their attention to finding Ozma. The Little Pink Bear reveals that Ozma is being carried in Button-Bright&#x27;s jacket pocket, imprisoned in the golden peach pit. The Wizard opens it with a knife, and Ozma is released. She was kidnapped by Ugu when she came upon him stealing her and the Wizard&#x27;s magic instruments. The people of the Emerald City and Ozma&#x27;s friends all celebrate her return.

<text>Wynn or wyn (; also spelled wen, win, ƿynn, ƿyn, ƿen, and ƿin) is a letter of the Old English alphabet, where it is used to represent the sound .

== History ==
=== The letter &quot;W&quot; ===
While the earliest Old English texts represent this phoneme with the digraph , scribes soon borrowed the rune &quot;wynn&quot; for this purpose. It remained a standard letter throughout the Anglo-Saxon era, eventually falling out of use during the Middle English period, circa 1300. In post-wynn texts, it was sometimes replaced with but often replaced with a ligature form of , which the modern letter developed from.

=== Meaning ===
The denotation of the rune is &quot;joy, bliss&quot;, known from the Anglo-Saxon rune poems:

=== Miscellaneous ===
It is not continued in the Younger Futhark, but in the Gothic alphabet, the letter &quot;w&quot; is called , allowing a Proto-Germanic reconstruction of the rune&#x27;s name as &quot;*wunjô&quot; &quot;joy&quot;.

It is one of the two runes (along with thorn, þ) to have been borrowed into the English alphabet (or any extension of the Latin alphabet). A modified version of the letter wynn called vend was used briefly in Old Norse for the sounds , , and .

The rune may have been an original innovation, or it may have been adapted from the classical Latin alphabet&#x27;s &quot;P&quot;, or &quot;Q&quot;, or from the Rhaetic&#x27;s alphabet&#x27;s &quot;W&quot;. As with þ, the letter wynn was revived in modern times for the printing of Old English texts, but since the early 20th century, the usual practice has been to substitute the modern .

<text>The gastrovascular cavity is the primary organ of digestion and circulation in two major animal phyla: the Coelenterates or cnidarians (including jellyfish and corals) and Platyhelminthes (flatworms). The cavity may be extensively branched into a system of canals. In cnidarians, the gastrovascular system is also known as the coelenteron, and is commonly known as a &quot;blind gut&quot; or &quot;blind sac&quot;, since food enters and waste exits through the same orifice.

The radially symmetrical cnidarians have a sac-like body in two distinct layers, the epidermis and gastrodermis, with a jellylike layer called the mesoglea between. Extracellular digestion takes place within the central cavity of the sac-like body. This cavity has only one opening to the outside which, in most cnidarians, is surrounded by tentacles for capturing prey.

<text>Elkton is an unincorporated community in Elkrun Township, Columbiana County, Ohio, United States. It lies along Ohio State Route 154 at the confluence of Elk Run and the Little Beaver Creek, and it has the ZIP code 44415. It is home to the Federal Correctional Institution, Elkton, a male exclusive low-security federal prison. Additionally, Elkton is home to one of the shortest covered bridges in the United States, the Church Hill Road Covered Bridge.

==History==
Elkton was platted in 1835. The community derives its name from nearby Elk Run creek. A post office called Elkton has been in operation since 1838. The community thrived due to its location on the Sandy and Beaver Canal, but was in decline by the late 1840s when the canal became unprofitable and was suspended.

<text>Saue is a town in north-western Estonia. It is the administrative centre of Saue Parish in Harju County.

The territory of Saue is and population about 5,800. Closest centres are Tallinn (), Keila (), Saku () and Laagri ().

== Geography ==
Saue is located at a very favourable position near Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. It lures a lot of moderately wealthy people who like the balance between the small town and big city atmosphere. While Saue is close to nature, it still provides the kinds of entertainment, jobs, and other big city amenities that Tallinn has to offer.

== History ==
*1620s – Saue manor (&quot;Klein-Sauß&quot;) was established
*1792 - The current manor house was built
*1870 - The Saint Petersburg–Tallinn–Paldiski railway passing Saue was completed
*1920s – Garden settlement started to arise
*1960s – Saue was united with Tallinn
*1973 – Saue, still part of Tallinn, gained a borough (&quot;alev&quot;) status
*1993 – Saue was granted the town rights
*1994 – Saue was separated from Tallinn and given a separate urban municipality status
*2017 – Saue town, Saue Parish, Kernu Parish and Nissi Parish were united and a new Saue Parish was formed

== Demographics ==
93% of the people living in Saue are ethnic Estonians. The average age of people is 35. Over the years, the census of the population has shown that the population is slowly growing. In 1959 there were 1,088 people living in Saue, by 1970 it had increased to 1,979. In 1979 it was 3,293, in 1989 the population was 4,395, in 1995 it was 4,492 and finally, by 2000, the population was 4,996.
== Economy ==
In Saue there is of private plots (average size of a plot is about ) – 1015 plots, about of communal buildings, garages etc., of industrial areas, Streets and roads about (there are 62 streets in Saue – about ), about of forests, parks etc. and about of fields.

== Transport ==

Saue is served by Saue railway station on the Tallinn-Keila railway line (serviced by Elron), as well as bus connections and fixed-route taxis.

== Saue Manor ==

Saue Manor () traces its origins to at least the 17th century. The current building was erected when the estate was owned by Friedrich Hermann von Fersen. The architect was very probably Johann Schultz, who was also the architect behind the baroque extension of Toompea Castle, Tallinn. The manor house complex is one of the finest examples of baroque manor house architecture in Estonia.

The exterior of the main house is characterised by a ground storey with rustications and a pilastered main floor. Wings (a stable-coach house and a granary) are linked to the main building via arched walls. The remains of a baroque park surrounds the manor, with noteworthy details such as sculptures of Heracles and Hera, and baroque sculptured reliefs.

The interior is noteworthy for its very rich display of stucco decorations of high quality in late baroque-early neoclassicist style. Stucco decorations adorn all the main rooms of the manor. Additionally, there are fine baroque cocklestoves in the manor.

<doc id="379198" wikidata="Q1762173" url="?curid=379198" title="Nerve net">
<text>A nerve net consists of interconnected neurons lacking a brain or any form of cephalization. While organisms with bilateral body symmetry are normally associated with a condensation of neurons or, in more advanced forms, a central nervous system, organisms with radial symmetry are associated with nerve nets, and are found in members of the Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and Echinodermata phyla, all of which are found in marine environments. In the Xenacoelomorpha, a phylum of bilaterally symmetrical animals, members of the subphylum Xenoturbellida also possess a nerve net. Nerve nets can provide animals with the ability to sense objects through the use of the sensory neurons within the nerve net.

It also exists in several other phyla, like chordates, annelids and flatworms, but then always alongside longitudinal nerve(s) and/or a brain.

The nerve net is the simplest form of a nervous system found in multicellular organisms. Unlike central nervous systems, where neurons are typically grouped together, neurons found in nerve nets are spread apart. This nervous system allows cnidarians to respond to physical contact. They can detect food and other chemicals in a rudimentary way. While a nerve net allows an organism to respond to its environment, it does not enable the organism to detect the source of the stimulus. For this reason, simple animals with nerve nets, such as &quot;Hydra&quot;, will typically produce the same motor output in response to contact with a stimulus, regardless of the point of contact.

The anatomy and positioning of nerve nets can vary from organism to organism. &quot;Hydra&quot;, which are cnidarians, have a nerve net throughout their body. On the other hand, sea stars, which are echinoderms, have a nerve net in each arm, connected by a central radial nerve ring at the center. This is better suited to controlling more complex movements than a diffuse nerve net.

==Evolution==

The emergence of true nervous tissue was once thought to have followed the divergence of last common ancestor of Porifera (sponges) and Cnidaria and Ctenophora. Recent taxonomic divisions, however, suggest that Ctenophora is sister to the other extant Metazoa.
Porifera is an extant phylum within the animal kingdom, and species belonging to this phylum do not have nervous systems. The placement of Ctenophora implies that either nervous systems were lost in the ancestor of Porifera, or they evolved independently in the ancestors of Ctenophora and ParaHoxozoa.
Although Porifera do not form synapses and myofibrils which allow for neuromuscular transmission, they do differentiate a proto-neuronal system and contain homologs of several genes found in Cnidaria which are important in nerve formation. Sponge cells have the ability to communicate with each other via calcium signaling or by other means. Sponge larvae differentiate sensory cells which respond to stimuli including light, gravity, and water movement, all of which increase the fitness of the organism. In addition to sensory cells differentiated during development, adult Porifera display contractile activity. 

The emergence of nervous systems has been linked to the evolution of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels. The Nav channels allow for communication between cells over long distances through the propagation of action potentials, whereas voltage-gated (Cav) calcium channels allow for unmodulated intercellular signaling. It has been hypothesized that Nav channels differentiated from Cav channels either at the emergence of nervous systems or before the emergence of multicellular organisms, although the origin of Nav channels in history remains unknown. Porifera either came about as a result of the divergence with Cnidaria and Ctenophora or they lost the function of the gene encoding Nav channels. As a result, Porifera contain Cav channels which allows for intercellular signaling, but they lack Nav channels which provide for the conductance of action potentials in nerve nets.

Nerve nets are found in species in the phyla Cnidaria (e.g. scyphozoa, box jellyfish, and sea anemones), Ctenophora, and Echinodermata. Cnidaria and Ctenophora both exhibit radial symmetry and are collectively known as coelenterates. Coelenterates diverged 570 million years ago, prior to the Cambrian explosion, and they are the first two phyla to possess nervous systems which differentiate during development and communicate by synaptic conduction. Most research on the evolution of nervous tissue concerning nerve nets has been conducted using cnidarians. The nervous systems of coelenterates allow for sensation, contraction, locomotion, and hunting/feeding behaviors. Coelenterates and bilaterians share common neurophysiological mechanisms; as such, coelenterates provide a model system for tracing the origins of neurogenesis. This is due to the first appearance of neurogenesis having occurred in eumetazoa, which was a common ancestor of coelenterates and bilaterians. A second wave of neurogenesis occurred after the divergence of coelenterata in the common ancestor of bilateria. Although animals with nerve nets lack a true brain, they have the ability to display complex movements and behaviors. The presence of a nerve net allows an organism belonging to the aforementioned phyla of Cnidaria, Ctenophora, and Echinodermata to have increased fitness as a result of being able to respond to their environment.

==Developmental neurogenesis==
Developmental neurogenesis of nerve nets is conserved between phyla and has been mainly studied in cnidaria, especially in the model organism &quot;Hydra&quot;. The following discusses the development of the nerve net in Cnidaria, but the same mechanism for the differentiation of nervous tissue is seen in Ctenophora and Echinodermata.

Cnidaria develop from two layers of tissue, the ectoderm and the endoderm, and are thus termed diploblasts. The ectoderm and the endoderm are separated by an extra-cellular matrix layer called the mesoglea. Cnidaria begin to differentiate their nervous systems in the late gastrula. In Hydrozoa and Anthozoa, interstitial stem cells from the endoderm generate neuroblasts and nematoblasts which migrate to the ectoderm and provide for the formation of the nervous system along the anterior-posterior axis. Non-hydrozoa lack interstitial stem cells, and the neurons arise from epithelial cells, which are most likely differentiated from the ectoderm as occurs in vertebrates. Differentiation occurs near the aboral pore and this is where most neurons remain.

In Cnidaria larvae, neurons are not distributed homogenously along the anterior-posterior axis; Cnidaria demonstrate anatomical polarities during the differentiation of a nervous system. There are two main hypotheses that attempt to explain neuronal cell differentiation. The zootype hypothesis says that regulatory genes define an anterior-posterior axis and the urbilateria hypothesis says that genes specify a dorsal-ventral axis. Experiments suggest that developmental neurogenesis is controlled along the anterior-posterior axis. The mechanism by which this occurs is similar to that concerning the anterior to posterior patterning of the central nervous systems in bilaterians. The conservation of the development of neuronal tissue along the anterior-posterior axis provides insight into the evolutionary divergence of coelenterates and bilaterians.

Neurogenesis occurs in Cnidaria not only during developmental stages, but also in adults. &quot;Hydra&quot;, a genus belonging to Cnidaria, is used as a model organism to study nerve nets. In the body column of &quot;Hydra&quot;, there is continuous division of epithelial cells occurring while the size of the &quot;Hydra&quot; remains constant. The movement of individual neurons is coupled to the movement of epithelial cells. Experiments have provided evidence that once neurons are differentiated, epithelial cell division drives their insertion into the nerve net. As neurogenesis occurs, a density gradient of neuronal cells appears in the body. The nerve net of each cnidarian species has a unique composition and the distribution of neurons throughout the body occurs by a density gradient along the proximal-distal axis. The density gradient goes from high to low from the proximal to the distal end of the &quot;Hydra&quot;. The highest concentration of neurons is in the basal disk and the lowest (if neurons are even present) is in the tentacles. During development of &quot;Hydra&quot;, the amount of neurons gradually increases to a certain level, and this density is maintained for the duration of the organism&#x27;s life-span, even following an amputation event. After amputation, regeneration occurs and the neuron density gradient is reestablished along the &quot;Hydra&quot;.

==Anatomy==
A nerve net is a diffuse network of cells that can congregate to form ganglia in some organisms, but does not constitute a brain. In terms of studying nerve nets, &quot;Hydra&quot; are an ideal class of Cnidaria to research and on which to run tests. Reasons why they are popular model organisms include the following: their nerve nets have a simple pattern to follow, they have a high rate of regeneration, and they are easy to manipulate in experimental procedures.

There are two categories of nerve cells that are found in the nerve nets of &quot;Hydra&quot;: ganglion and sensory. While ganglion cells are normally found near the basal ends of the epithelial cells, sensory cells generally extend in an apical direction from the muscle processes of the basal ends. While Ganglia generally provide intermediary connections between different neurological structures within a nervous system, sensory cells serve in detecting different stimuli which could include light, sound, touch or temperature.

There are many subsets of neurons within a nerve net and their placement is highly position specific. Every subset of a nerve net has a constant and regional distribution. In a &quot;Hydra&quot;, cell bodies of epidermal sensory cells are usually found around the mouth at the &#x27;s apical tip, neurites are usually directed down the sides of the hypostome in a radial direction, and ganglion cells are found in the hypostome&#x27;s basal region (in between tentacles and just below the head). Nerve nets contain intermediate neurons which allow for modulation of neural activity which occurs between the sensation of the stimulus and motor output.

==Physiology==

Each sensory neuron within a nerve net responds to each stimulus, like odors or tactile stimuli. The motor neurons communicate with cells via chemical synapse to produce a certain reaction to a given stimulus, therefore a stronger stimulus produces a stronger reaction from the organism. If a particular stimulus is larger than another, then more receptors of the sensory cells (which detect stimuli) will be stimulated which will ultimately trigger a larger response. In a typical unmyelinated axon, the action potential is conducted at a rate of about 5 meters per second, compared to a myelinated human neural fiber which conducts at around 120 meters per second.

While nerve nets use hormones, the total physiology is not very well understood. Hormones normally found in vertebrates have been identified in nerve net tissues. Whether they serve the same function as those found in vertebrates is not known and little research has been performed to solve the question. Hormones such as steroids, neuropeptides, indolamines, and other iodinated organic compounds have been seen in tissues of cnidarians. These hormones play a role in multiple pathways in vertebrae neurophysiology and endocrine system including reward and complex biochemical stimulation pathways for regulation of lipid synthesis or similar sex steroids.

Since cnidarian cells are not organized into organ systems it is difficult to assume the role of the endocrine-nerve net system employed by these types of species. A nerve net is considered to be a separate structure in the cnidarians and is associated with signal molecules; it is primarily considered a neurochemical pathway. Potential signal molecules have been noted in certain nerve net anatomy. How the signal molecules work is not known. It has been shown, however, that the nematocyst (stinging) response is not related to nerve activity.

<doc id="379199" wikidata="Q15975212" url="?curid=379199" title="Phase Space (story collection)">
<text>Phase Space (subtitled &quot;Stories from the Manifold and Elsewhere&quot;) is a 2003 science fiction collection by British writer Stephen Baxter, containing twenty-three thematically linked stories, in which the human relationship with the universe is explored: whether humanity is truly alone in the universe, if there are other intelligent species, if these have turned their backs on us, or if expansion itself is destined to fail.

Written in the same style as most of Stephen Baxter&#x27;s work, &quot;Phase Space&quot; is a collection of more or less scientifically based stories in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke. The stories are mostly set in the same Multiverse as the books in his Manifold series, with a few stories related to his separate NASA Trilogy.

The book contains the following short stories:

*Dreams (I)
**&quot;Moon-Calf&quot; (1998) – A retired astronaut finds hints of an ancient space voyage while on holiday in England.
*Earths
**&quot;Open Loops&quot; (2000) – An astronaut explores, and later becomes a colonist on an asteroid, observing the expansion and evolution of humanity over the millennia.
**&quot;Glass Earth, Inc.&quot; (1997) – A policeman must sort through the memories of a murder to find out who the killer is, and in the process, learns more about himself than he ever knew.
**&quot;Poyekhali 3201&quot; (1997) – The experiences of a Russian cosmonaut are no more than the ultimate re-enactment. (An earlier version of this story appeared in &quot;Decalog 5: Wonders&quot; (1997).)
**&quot;Dante Dreams&quot; (1998) – A police woman from San Francisco travels to the Vatican to investigate the suicide of a Jesuit priest and an illegally created sentient hologram based on the late priest.
**&quot;War Birds&quot; (1997) – When Apollo 11 explodes on the Moon, the US blames the Russians, then fast-tracks its Space Shuttle program for military applications and becomes a fascist state.
*Worlds
**&quot;Sun-Drenched&quot; (1998) – When two Apollo astronauts are stranded on the Moon, they decide to expose themselves to the elements in the hope of colonising the Moon with bacteria and viruses from their own bodies.
**&quot;Martian Autumn&quot; (2002) – Too much environmental stress and life on Earth might undergo an evolutionary &quot;reboot&quot;, like what happened on Mars.
**&quot;Sun God&quot; (1997) – A pendant to &quot;Titan&quot;, in which a Titanian beetle finds an abandoned Saturn rocket and studies the strange creatures (humans) who made it. 
**&quot;Sun-Cloud&quot; (2001) – A sentient multi-corpuscular being travels to the distant future to fulfill her dying sister&#x27;s dream: to witness the emergence of stars.
*Manifold
**&quot;Sheena 5&quot; – The sentient squid plotline of &quot;&quot; as a separate short story, with a different ending.
**&quot;The Fubar Suit&quot; (1997) – An astronaut is stranded in space wearing a suit guaranteed to re-create her when her corpse is discovered. Meanwhile, a microscopic world evolves inside the suit, threatening her existence.
**&quot;Grey Earth&quot; (2001) – The end of &quot;&quot; from the viewpoint of Mary, the Neanderthal friend of Nemoto, set on the axis-tilted Earth of the Neanderthals.
**&quot;Huddle&quot; (1999) – Madeleine Meacher from &quot;&quot; returns to an Earth where the descendants of humans occupy the ecological niche of seals or penguins, a hundred thousand years after the events of the novel.
*Paradox
**&quot;Refugium&quot; (2002) – Two men, an enthusiast and a cynic, set out in an alien spacecraft to discover an answer to the Fermi paradox: where have all the extraterrestrial civilisations gone?
**&quot;Lost Continent&quot; (2001) – Two friends discuss the possibility that Atlantis may have been more than a myth, and may have been more recent than anyone ever dreamed.
**&quot;Tracks&quot; (2001) – Two astronauts are on the Moon in 1973 collecting rock samples; things go wrong and the mission is aborted. But what the astronauts remember is much stranger than what the video tapes show.
**&quot;Lines of Longitude&quot; (1997) – A physicist teaching a community college course must cope with reality when one of her students dies after having disappeared for several days. The aftermath of his death have graver consequences than she can imagine.
**&quot;The Barrier&quot; (1998) – Two old men travel through space in a malfunctioning ship toward the edge of all; an exploration of the Zoo Hypothesis.
**&quot;Marginalia&quot; (1999) – Baxter&#x27;s novel &quot;Voyage&quot; as conspiracy theory- the idea that NASA really did go to Mars in the 1970s is explored.
**&quot;The We Who Sing&quot; (2002) – Intelligence exists in a universe of shining gas clouds, before space became transparent.
**&quot;The Gravity Mine&quot; (2000) – Posthuman beings in the deep future of &quot;&quot; struggle in a dying universe.
**&quot;Spindrift&quot; (1999) – Will human endeavours (e.g. colonisation of the Moon) have any ultimate consequence? Or will humanity arise then vanish unobserved, like spindrift?
**&quot;Touching Centauri&quot; (2003) – Scientists attempting to use a laser to contact another world inadvertently cause the end of their universe, while everyone struggles with the ultimate nature of their existence. (While snippets of the story are touched upon between each previous story, the full explanation is given here.)
*Dreams (II)
**&quot;The Twelfth Album&quot; (1998) – Two friends mourning their departed shipmate find a strange Beatles record, leading them to believe that their friend&#x27;s drunken ravings might have been true.

<text>Brad Garton (born 1957) is an American composer and computer musician who is professor of music at Columbia University.

He has written, or helped to write, a number of computer music applications, including Real-Time Cmix, music synthesis and signal processing language for real time composition. He received his doctorate in composition from Princeton University. Garton is director-emeritus of the Computer Music Center, Columbia University, formerly the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center.

Garton grew up in Columbus, Indiana. His father, Robert, has served more than 30 years as a Republican in the Indiana state Senate, including a long term as Senate President Pro Tem. Garton majored in pharmacy as a Purdue University student, but spent much of his time on music. Billing himself as &quot;Mr. Science&quot;, Garton provided sound effects and keyboards for the band Dow Jones and the Industrials in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He also produced many acts, making a heavy contribution to the Indiana music scene, and with Richard K. Thomas founded Zounds Studios, which continues to produce music and sound for theater. He talked about his life and his formation as a musician in an interview with Peter Shea in February 2007.

<doc id="379202" wikidata="Q159404" url="?curid=379202" title="American bullfrog">
<text>The American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus), often simply known as the bullfrog in Canada and the United States, is a large true frog native to eastern North America. It typically inhabits large permanent water bodies such as swamps, ponds, and lakes. Bullfrogs can also be found in manmade habitats such as pools, koi ponds, canals, ditches and culverts. The bullfrog gets its name from the sound the male makes during the breeding season, which sounds similar to a bull bellowing. The bullfrog is large and is commonly eaten throughout its range, especially in the southern United States where they are plentiful.

Their presence as a food source has led to bullfrogs being distributed around the world outside of their native range. Bullfrogs have been introduced into the Western United States, South America, Western Europe, China, Japan, and southeast Asia. In these places they are considered an invasive species due to their voracious appetite and the large number of eggs they produce, which has a negative effect on native amphibians, certain insects and other fauna. Bullfrogs are very skittish which can make their capture difficult and thus they often become established.

Other than for food, bullfrogs are also used for dissection in human science classes. Albino bullfrogs are sometimes kept as pets, and bullfrog tadpoles are often sold at ponds or fish stores.

==Taxonomy==
Some authorities use the scientific name, &quot;Lithobates catesbeiana&quot;, although others prefer &quot;Rana catesbeiana&quot;.

===Genome===
The nuclear genome (~5.8Gbp) of the North American bullfrog (&quot;Rana [Lithobates] catesbeiana&quot;) was published in 2017 and provides a resource for future Ranidae research.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;catesbeiana&quot; (feminine) or &quot;catesbeianus&quot; (masculine), is in honor of English naturalist Mark Catesby.

==Description==

The dorsal (upper) surface of the bullfrog has an olive-green basal color, either plain or with mottling and banding of grayish brown. The ventral (under) surface is off-white blotched with yellow or gray. Often, a marked contrast in color is seen between the green upper lip and the pale lower lip. The teeth are tiny and are useful only in grasping. The eyes are prominent with brown irises and horizontal, almond-shaped pupils. The tympana (eardrums) are easily seen just behind the eyes and the dorsolateral folds of skin enclose them. The limbs are blotched or banded with gray. The fore legs are short and sturdy and the hind legs are long. The front toes are not webbed, but the back toes have webbing between the digits with the exception of the fourth toe, which is unwebbed.

Bullfrogs are sexually dimorphic, with males being smaller than females and having yellow throats. Males have tympana larger than their eyes, whereas the tympana in females are about the same size as the eyes. Bullfrogs measure about in snout–to–vent length. They grow fast in the first eight months of life, typically increasing in weight from , and large, mature individuals can weigh up to . In some cases bullfrogs have been recorded as attaining and measuring up to from snout to vent. The American bullfrog is the largest species of true frog in North America.

== Online Model Organism Database ==
xenbase provides limited support (BLAST, JBrowse tracks, genome download) for the bullfrog.

==Distribution==

The bullfrog is originally native to eastern North America, where it is commonly found in every U.S. state east of the Mississippi River. Its natural range extends from the eastern Canadian Maritime Provinces to as far west as Idaho and Texas, and as far north as Michigan (including the Upper Peninsula), Minnesota and Montana; it is largely absent in North Dakota. The bullfrog has also been introduced onto Nantucket island, as well as portions of the western U.S., including Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. In these states, it is considered to be an invasive species, as concerns exist that it may outcompete or prey upon native species of reptiles and amphibians, disrupting the delicate ecological balance of certain areas. The bullfrog has been introduced in Hawaii, South America, Asia, the Caribbean, and Europe for various purposes including frog farming and population control of other species. It is very common on the West Coast, especially in California, where it is believed to pose a threat to the California red-legged frog, and is considered to be a factor in the decline of that vulnerable species. Bullfrogs have been found to feed on the young of several snakes, including the California endemic giant garter snake, a threatened species. In early 2023, the Utah Department of Natural Resources began tweeting tips on how to catch and cook bullfrogs in an effort to encourage residents to help control the growing population by catching the invasive frogs for food.

Other countries and regions into which the bullfrog has been introduced include the extreme south of British Columbia, Canada, nearly every state in Mexico, as well as Belgium, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Italy, Jamaica, the Netherlands, and Puerto Rico. It is also found in Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Japan, South Korea, Uruguay and Venezuela. The reasons for introducing the bullfrog to these areas have largely been intentional, either to provide humans with a source of food or as biological control agents. In addition to the unintended escape of frogs from breeding establishments or scientific research facilities, captive escapees or released pets are also a possibility. Conservationists are concerned that the bullfrog is relatively immune to the fungal infection &quot;chytridiomycosis&quot; (also called &#x27;chytrid&#x27; fungus) which has been ravaging numerous frog species, and, as it invades new territories, it may assist in the spread of this lethal fungus as an asymptomatic carrier to the more susceptible, native species of frog it encounters.

==Breeding behavior==
The bullfrog breeding season typically lasts two to three months. A study of bullfrogs in Michigan showed the males arriving at the breeding site in late May or early June, and remaining in the area into July. The territorial males that occupy sites are usually spaced some apart and call loudly. At least three different types of calls have been noted in male bullfrogs under different circumstances. These distinctive calls include territorial calls made as threats to other males, advertisement calls made to attract females, and encounter calls which precede combat.

The bullfrogs have a prolonged breeding season, with the males continuously engaging in sexual activity throughout. Though The reproductive cycle of American bullfrogs in Oregon is mainly restricted to the summer season when individuals congregate in lentic freshwater systems. Males are present at the breeding pond for longer periods than females during the entire season, increasing their chances of multiple matings. The sex ratio is typically skewed toward males. Conversely, females have brief periods of sexual receptivity during the season. In one study, female sexual activity typically lasted for a single night and mating did not occur unless the females initiated the physical contact. Males only clasp females after they have indicated their willingness to mate. This finding refutes previous claims that a male frog will clasp any proximate female with no regard to whether the female has consented. Once a male finds a receptive female he will clasp onto her and undergo amplexus—reproductive position—by utilization of the males&#x27; forelimbs. The enlargement of forelimb muscles is a sexually dimorphic trait seen in the male bullfrog. One study investigating male and female bullfrog forelimbs muscles found males had significantly stronger muscles that could undergo longer durations of activity before the onset of fatigue. The significance of forelimb sexual dimorphism allow males to remain in amplexus with the female for longer durations increasing their chance at reproductive success in the highly competitive mating environment.

These male and female behaviors cause male-to-male competition to be high within the bullfrog population and sexual selection for the females to be an intense process. Kentwood Wells postulated leks, territorial polygyny, and harems are the most likely classifications for the bullfrog mating system. Leks would be a valid description because males congregate to attract females, and the females arrive to the site for the purpose of copulation. In a 1980 study on bullfrogs in New Jersey, the mating system was classified as resource-defense polygyny. The males defended territories within the group and demonstrated typical physical forms of defense.

===Choruses===
Male bullfrogs aggregate into groups called choruses. The male chorus behavior is analogous to the lek formation of birds, mammals, and other vertebrates. Choruses are dynamic, forming and remaining associated for a few days, breaking down temporarily, and then forming again in a new area with a different group of males. Male movement has experimentally been noted to be dynamic. In the Michigan study, the choruses were described as &quot;centers of attraction&quot; in which their larger numbers enhanced the males&#x27; overall acoustical displays. This is more attractive to females and also attractive to other sexually active males. Choruses in this study were dynamic, constantly forming and breaking up. New choruses were formed in other areas of the site. Males moved around and were highly mobile within the choruses.

A review of multiple studies on bullfrogs and other anurans noted male behavior within the groups changes according to the population density of the leks. At higher population densities, leks are favored due to the difficulty in defending individual territories among a large population of males. This variance causes differences in how females choose their mates. When the male population density is low and males maintain clearer, more distinct territories, female choice is mostly determined by territory quality. When male population density is higher, females depend on other cues to select their mates. These cues include the males&#x27; positions within the chorus and differences in male display behaviors among other determinants. Social dominance within the choruses is established through challenges, threats, and other physical displays. Older males tend to acquire more central locations while younger males were restricted to the periphery.

Chorus tenure is the number of nights that a male participates in the breeding chorus. One study distinguishes between chorus tenure and dominant tenure. Dominant tenure is more strictly defined as the amount of time a male maintains a dominant status. Chorus tenure is restricted due to increased risk of predation, lost foraging opportunities, and higher energy consumption. Calling is postulated to be energetically costly to anurans in general. Energy is also expended through locomotion and aggressive interactions of male bullfrogs within the chorus.

===Aggressive behavior===
To establish social dominance within choruses, bullfrogs demonstrate various forms of aggression, especially through visual displays. Posture is a key factor in establishing social position and threatening challengers. Territorial males have inflated postures while non-territorial males remain in the water with only their heads showing. For dominant (territorial) males, their elevated posture reveals their yellow-colored throats. When two dominant males encounter each other, they engage in a wrestling bout. The males have their venters clasped, each individual in an erect position rising to well above water level. The New Jersey study noted the males would approach each other to within a few centimeters and then tilt back their heads, displaying their brilliantly colored gular sacs. The gular is dichromatic in bullfrogs, with dominant and fitter males displaying yellow gulars. The New Jersey study also reported low posture with only the head exposed above the water surface was typical of subordinate, or non-territorial males, and females. High posture was demonstrated by territorial males, which floated on the surface of the water with their lungs inflated, displaying their yellow gulars. Males optimize their reproductive fitness in a number of ways. Early arrival at the breeding site, prolonged breeding with continuous sexual activity throughout the season, ownership of a centrally located territory within the chorus, and successful movement between the dynamically changing choruses are all common ways for males to maintain dominant, or territorial, status within the chorus. Older males have greater success in all of these areas than younger males. Some of the males display a more inferior role, termed by many researchers as the silent male status. These silent males adopt a submissive posture, sit near resident males and make no attempt to displace them. The silent males do not attempt to intercept females but are waiting for the territories to become vacant. This has also been called the alternate or satellite male strategy.

==Growth and development==
After selecting a male, the female deposits eggs in his territory. During the mating grasp, or amplexus, the male rides on top of the female, grasping her just behind her fore limbs. The female chooses a site in shallow water among vegetation, and lays a batch of up to 20,000 eggs, and the male simultaneously releases sperm, resulting in external fertilization. The eggs form a thin, floating sheet which may cover an area of . The embryos develop best at water temperatures between and hatch in three to five days. 

If the water temperature rises above
, developmental abnormalities occur, and if it falls below , normal development ceases. Newly hatched tadpoles show a preference for living in shallow water on fine gravel bottoms. American bullfrog tadpoles have also &quot;showed a preference for habitats 
containing structure.&quot; This may reflect a lesser number of predators in these locations. As they grow, they tend to move into deeper water. The tadpoles initially have three pairs of external gills and several rows of labial teeth. They pump water through their gills by movements of the floor of their mouths, trapping bacteria, single-celled algae, protozoans, pollen grains, and other small particles on mucus in a filtration organ in their pharynges. As they grow, they begin to ingest larger particles and use their teeth for rasping. They have downward-facing mouths, deep bodies, and tails with broad dorsal and ventral fins.

Time to metamorphosis ranges from a few months in the southern part of the range to 3 years in the north, where the colder water slows development. Maximum lifespan in the wild is estimated to be 8 to 10 years, but one frog lived for almost 16 years in captivity.

== Feeding ==
Bullfrogs are voracious, opportunistic, ambush predators that prey on any small animal they can overpower and consume. Bullfrog stomachs have been found to contain rodents, small lizards and snakes, other frogs and toads, other amphibians, crayfish, other crustaceans, small birds, scorpions, tarantulas and bats, as well as the many types of invertebrates, such as snails, worms and insects, which are the usual food of ranid frogs. These studies revealed the bullfrog&#x27;s diet to be unique among North American ranids in the inclusion of a large percentage of aquatic animals, such as fish, tadpoles, ram&#x27;s horn snails, and dytiscid beetles, as well as the aquatic eggs of fish, frogs, insects, or salamanders. Cannibalism has been observed in bullfrog populations in resource-limited environments. Bullfrogs are able to capture large, strong prey because of the powerful grip of their jaws after the initial ranid tongue strike. However, there is a correlation found with size of prey relative to body size of the bullfrog. Juveniles and adults typically go after prey that is relative to their own body size. The bullfrog is able to make allowance for light refraction at the water-air interface by striking at a position posterior to the target&#x27;s perceived location. The comparative ability of bullfrogs to capture submerged prey, compared to that of the green frog, leopard frog, and wood frog (&quot;L. clamitans, L. pipiens&quot;, and &quot;L. sylvaticus&quot;, respectively) was also demonstrated in laboratory experiments.

Prey motion elicits feeding behavior. First, if necessary, the frog performs a single, orienting bodily rotation ending with the frog aimed towards the prey, followed by approaching leaps, if necessary. Once within striking distance, the bullfrog begins its feeding strike, which consists of a ballistic lunge (eyes closed as during all leaps) that ends with the mouth opening. At this stage, the fleshy, mucus-coated tongue is extended towards the prey, often engulfing it, while the jaws continue their forward travel to close (bite) just as the tongue is retracted. Large prey that do not fit entirely into the mouth are stuffed in with the hands. In laboratory observations, bullfrogs taking mice usually swam underwater with prey in mouth, apparently with the advantageous result of altering the mouse&#x27;s defense from counter-attack to struggling for air. Asphyxiation is the most likely cause of death of warm-blooded prey.

=== Biomechanical background of tongue projection ===
The speed of a bullfrog&#x27;s tongue strike is much faster than it should be if muscles were the only force behind it. Similar to the tension on a slingshot pulled all the way back, when the frog&#x27;s mouth is closed, tension is put into the elastic tissues of the tongue, and also into the elastic tendons of the lower jaw. When the frog attacks prey, opening its mouth is like letting go of the slingshot; the elastic force stored up in both the tongue and the jaw are combined to shoot the tip of the tongue toward the prey much faster than the prey&#x27;s ability to see the strike and evade capture, completing the strike and retrieval in approximately 0.07 seconds. Another benefit of this elastic-force based attack is that it is not dependent on background temperature. A frog with a cold body temperature has muscles that move more slowly, but it can still attack prey with the same speed as if its body was warm.

Ballistic tongue projection of the related leopard frog is possible due to the presence of elastic structures that allow storage and subsequent release of elastic recoil energy. This accounts for the tongue projecting with higher power output than would develop by muscular action alone. Also, such mechanism relieves the tongue&#x27;s musculature from physiological constraints such as limited peak power output - mechanical efficiency and thermal dependence by uncoupling the activation of the depressor mandibulae&#x27;s contractile units from actual muscular movement. In other words, the kinematic parameters developed by contribution of the elastic structures differ from those developed by muscular projection, accounting for the difference in velocity, power output, and thermal dependence.

==Ecology==

Bullfrogs are an important item of prey to many birds (especially large herons), North American river otters (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;), predatory fish, and occasionally other amphibians. Predators of American bullfrogs once in their adult stages can range from belted kingfishers (&quot;Megaceryle alcyon&quot;) to American alligators (&quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;). The eggs and larvae are unpalatable to many salamanders and fish, but the high levels of activity of the tadpoles may make them more noticeable to a predator not deterred by their unpleasant taste. Humans hunt bullfrogs as game and consume their legs. Adult frogs try to escape by splashing and leaping into deep water. A trapped individual may squawk or emit a piercing scream, which may surprise the attacker sufficiently for the frog to escape. An attack on one bullfrog is likely to alert others in the vicinity to danger and they will all retreat into the safety of deeper water. Bullfrogs may be at least partially resistant to the venom of copperhead (&quot;Agkistrodon contortrix&quot;) and cottonmouth (&quot;Agkistrodon piscivorus&quot;) snakes, though these species are known natural predators of bullfrogs as are northern water snakes (&quot;Nerodia sipedon&quot;).

Considering the invasive nature of the &quot;L. catesbeianus&quot;, multiple traits within the species contribute to its competitive ability. The generalist diet of the American bullfrog allows for it to consume food in different environments. When observing the contents of American bullfrog stomachs, it was discovered that adult bullfrogs regularly consume predators of bullfrog young, including dragonfly nymphs, garter snakes, and giant water bugs. Thus, the ecological check on American bullfrog juveniles in invaded areas become less effective. &quot;L. catesbeianus&quot; seems to exhibit traits of immunity or resistance against the antipredator defenses of other organisms. Analysis of stomach contents from bullfrog populations in New Mexico show the regular consumption of wasps, with no conditioned avoidance due to the wasps&#x27; stingers. Along the Colorado river, &quot;L. catesbeianus&quot; stomach contents indicate the ability to withstand the discomforting spines of the stickleback fish. Reports of American bullfrogs eating scorpions and rattlesnakes also exist.

Analysis of the American bullfrog&#x27;s realized niche at various sites in Mexico, and comparisons with the niches of endemic frogs show that it is possible that the American bullfrog capable of niche shift, and pose a threat to many endemic Mexican frog species, even those that are not currently in competition with the American bullfrog.

=== Invasive species ===
In areas where the American bullfrog is introduced, the population can be controlled by various means. One project (3n-Bullfrog project) uses sterile triploïd (3n) bullfrogs. In Europe, the American bullfrog is included since 2016 in the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). This means that this species cannot under any circumstances be imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union. 

Self-sustaining populations of American bullfrogs became established in the United Kingdom around 1999, where their introduction was likely due to accidental escapes and deliberate releases from captivity. These populations appear to be quite small, and are undergoing control by Natural England as the species poses a threat to native amphibians.

The American bullfrog has been known to spread the amphibian pathogen &quot;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&quot; among populations that it has been introduced to.

==Human use==

The American bullfrog provides a food source, especially in the Southern and some areas of the Midwestern United States. The traditional way of hunting them is to paddle or pole silently by canoe or flatboat in ponds or swamps at night; when the frog&#x27;s call is heard, a light is shone at the frog which temporarily inhibits its movement. The frog will not jump into deeper water as long as it is approached slowly and steadily. When close enough, the frog is gigged with a multiple-tined spear and brought into the boat. Bullfrogs can also be stalked on land, by again taking great care not to startle them. In some states, breaking the skin while catching them is illegal, and either grasping gigs or hand captures are used. Like most frogs, the hind legs of the bullfrog are the only parts generally eaten. When cooked, they resemble small chicken drumsticks, have a similar flavor and texture and can be prepared in similar ways.

Commercial bullfrog culture in near-natural enclosed ponds has been attempted, but is fraught with difficulties. Although pelleted feed is available, frogs usually will not willingly consume artificial diets, and providing sufficient live prey is challenging. Disease among frogs also tends to be a problem even when great care is taken to provide sanitary conditions. Other challenges to be overcome may be predation, cannibalism, and low water quality. The frogs are large, have powerful leaps, and inevitably escape after which they may wreak havoc among the native frog population. Countries that export bullfrog legs include the Netherlands, Belgium, Mexico, Bangladesh, Japan, China, Taiwan, and Indonesia. Most of these frogs are caught in the wild, but some are raised in captivity. The United States is a net importer of frog legs.

The American bullfrog is used as a specimen for dissection in many biology and anatomy classes in schools across the world. It is the state amphibian of Missouri, Ohio, and Oklahoma.

<text>Haapsalu () is a seaside resort town located on the west coast of Estonia. It is the administrative centre of Lääne County, and on 1 January 2020 it had a population of 9,375.

==History==
The name &quot;Haapsalu&quot; derives from the Estonian words &quot;haab&quot; &#x27;aspen&#x27; and &quot;salu&quot; in the archaic sense &#x27;(forested) island&#x27; (now &#x27;grove&#x27;). Until the first half of the 20th century, in Swedish and German the town was called &quot;Hapsal&quot;. Haapsalu and the surrounding area was the center for the Estonian Swedes from the 13th century until the evacuation of almost all ethnic Swedes from Estonia prior to the Soviet invasion of Estonia during World War II in 1944.

The first written record of Haapsalu dates back to 1279, when the town was chartered and became the capital of the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek, which it remained for the following three centuries. Buildings from those early days remain today, including an episcopal castle, which has the largest single-nave church in Estonia.

==Neighborhoods of Haapsalu==
There are six neighborhoods of Haapsalu:
*Holmi
*Kesklinn
*Männiku
*Paralepa
*Randsalu
*Vanalinn.

==Healing by sea mud==
The sea mud in Haapsalu is claimed to have a curative effect. A military doctor, Carl Abraham Hunnius, founded the first mud cure resort in 1825. News of the &quot;curative mud&quot; spread quickly amongst the wealthy customers in then capital city Saint Petersburg, and elsewhere in the former Russian Empire. The mud spas were frequented by the Russian imperial Romanov family. For almost 200 years, Haapsalu has been a popular summer destination where people from all around the world come for medical treatment. At present, there are three &quot;mud cure&quot; establishments in Haapsalu.

==Other attractions==
The Land of Ilon Wikland (&quot;Wiklandia&quot;), a recreation centre for children, is set to open in a few years within the town. Wikland, a famous book illustrator, has had a strong bond with Haapsalu since her childhood.

The August Blues Festival is held every year in August in Haapsalu.

Since 2005, the town hosts Haapsalu Horror and Fantasy Film Festival, an annual film festival dedicated to genre films. In 2017, the pastors of Haapsalu made an open statement calling to end the city&#x27;s financing of the festival, claiming the horror and violence depicted in the screened films were not fit to represent the resort town image. The same year the festival was held to a record-breaking attendance.

== Demographics ==
==In popular culture==
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in 1867 wrote a suite of three pieces for piano during his stay in Haapsalu, titled Souvenir de Hapsal.

In the 19th century, the town became famous for its &quot;Haapsalu shawls&quot;, a delicate craft made by local women.

Haapsalu has sometimes been called the &quot;Venice of the Baltics&quot; — an apparent exaggeration used mostly to promote the resort town to foreign tourists.

Haapsalu is site of a fencing school founded by Estonian fencer Endel Nelis, used as the setting of the Finnish-Estonian film &quot;The Fencer&quot;.

<doc id="379210" wikidata="Q156954" url="?curid=379210" title="Colorado potato beetle">
<text>The Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata; also known as the Colorado beetle, the ten-striped spearman, the ten-lined potato beetle, and the potato bug) is a beetle known for being a major pest of potato crops. It is about long, with a bright yellow/orange body and five bold brown stripes along the length of each of its wings. Native to the Rocky Mountains, it spread rapidly in potato crops across America and then Europe from 1859 onwards.

The Colorado potato beetle was first observed in 1811 by Thomas Nuttall and was formally described in 1824 by American entomologist Thomas Say. The beetles were collected in the Rocky Mountains, where they were feeding on the buffalo bur, &quot;Solanum rostratum&quot;.

==Description==
Adult beetles typically are in length and in width. They weigh 50–170 mg. The beetles are orange-yellow in color with 10 characteristic black stripes on their front wings or elytra. The specific name &quot;decemlineata&quot;, meaning &quot;ten-lined&quot;, derives from this feature.

Adult beetles may be visually confused with &quot;L. juncta&quot;, which is the false potato beetle. Unlike the Colorado potato beetle, it is not an agricultural pest. &quot;L. juncta&quot; also has alternating black and white strips on its back, but one of the white strips in the center of each wing cover is missing and replaced by a light brown strip.

=== Larvae ===
The orange-pink larvae have a large, 9-segmented abdomen, black head, and prominent spiracles, and may measure up to in length in their final instar stage.

The beetle larva has four instar stages. The head remains black throughout these stages, but the pronotum changes colour from black in first- and second-instar larvae to having an orange-brown edge in its third-instar. In fourth-instar larvae, about half the pronotum is coloured light brown. This tribe is characterised within the subfamily by round to oval-shaped convex bodies, which are usually brightly coloured, simple claws which separate at the base, open cavities behind the procoxae, and a variable apical segment of the maxillary palp.

==Distribution==
The beetle is most likely native to the area between Colorado and northern Mexico, and was discovered in 1824 by Thomas Say in the Rocky Mountains. It is found in North America, and is present in every state and province except Alaska, California, Hawaii, and Nevada. It now has a wide distribution across Europe and Asia, totaling over 16 million km2.

Its first association with the potato plant (&quot;Solanum tuberosum&quot;) was not made until about 1859, when it began destroying potato crops in the region of Omaha, Nebraska. Its spread eastward was rapid, at an average distance of 140 km per year. The beetle has the potential to spread to temperate areas of East Asia, India, South America, Africa, New Zealand, and Australia.

=== Human interaction ===
By 1874 it had reached the Atlantic Coast. From 1871, American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley warned Europeans about the potential for an accidental infestation caused by the transportation of the beetle from America. From 1875, several Western European countries, including Germany, Belgium, France, and Switzerland, banned imports of American potatoes to avoid infestation by &quot;L. decemlineata&quot;.

These controls proved ineffective, as the beetle soon reached Europe. In 1877, &quot;L. decemlineata&quot; reached the United Kingdom and was first recorded from Liverpool docks, but it did not become established. Many further outbreaks have occurred; the species has been eradicated in the UK at least 163 times. The last major outbreak was in 1977. It remains as a notifiable quarantine pest in the United Kingdom and is monitored by the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate of the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) to prevent it from becoming established. A cost-benefit analysis from 1981 suggested that the cost of the measures used to exclude &quot;L. decemlineata&quot; from the UK was less than the likely costs of control if it became established.

In July 2023, Colorado beetle were officially confirmed in a potato field in Kent, England. Farmers and growers, gardeners and members of the public are being encouraged to remain vigilant for signs of the pest and to report potential sightings to APHA.

Elsewhere in Europe, the beetle became established near USA military bases in Bordeaux during or immediately following World War I and had proceeded to spread by the beginning of World War II to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain. The population increased dramatically during and immediately following World War II and spread eastward, and the beetle is now found over much of the continent. After World War II, in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, almost half of all potato fields were infested by the beetle by 1950. In East Germany, they were known as &quot;Amikäfer&quot; (&#x27;Yankee beetles&#x27;) following a governmental claim that the beetles were dropped by American planes. In the European Union, it remains a regulated (quarantine) pest for the Republic of Ireland, Balearic Islands, Cyprus, Malta, and southern parts of Sweden and Finland. It is not established in any of these member states, but occasional infestations can occur when, for example, wind blows adults from Russia to Finland.

==Lifecycle==
Colorado potato beetle females are very prolific and are capable of laying over 500 eggs in a 4- to 5-week period. The eggs are yellow to orange, and are about long. They are usually deposited in batches of about 30 eggs on the underside of host leaves. Development of all life stages depends on temperature.

After 4–15 days, the eggs hatch into reddish-brown larvae with humped backs and two rows of dark brown spots, one row on each side. They feed on the leaves of their host plants. Larvae progress through four distinct growth stages (instars). First instars measure about long, and the last (fourth) instars about long. The first through third instars each last about 2–3 days; the fourth lasts 4–7 days.

Upon reaching full size, each fourth instar spends several days as a nonfeeding prepupa, which can be recognized by its inactivity and lighter coloration. The prepupae drop to the soil and burrow to a depth of several inches, then pupate. In 5 to 10 days, the adult beetle emerges to feed and mate. This beetle can thus go from egg to adult in as little as 21 days. Depending on temperature, light conditions, and host quality, the adults may enter diapause and delay emergence until spring. They then return to their host plants to mate and feed; overwintering adults may begin mating within 24 hours of spring emergence. In some locations, three or more generations may occur each growing season.

=== Mate and host searching ===
Visual cues are important for Colorado potato beetles during the mate and host search. In a study done by Szentsi, Weber, and Jermy in the paper &quot;Role of visual stimuli in host and mate location of the Colorado potato beetle,&quot; the beetles&#x27; attraction to boards with different spectral bands, reaction to beetle-sized stationary objects, responses to such objects on boards, and attraction to prior female substances were investigated. The researchers&#x27; hypothesis was that experience with female substances would cause behavior changes in males. When shown colored boards, the beetles had a positive response between 45° and 0° in terms of mean angular directions (MADs). Beads and dead beetles without boards evoked a weaker response with MADs being variable. Colored boards and bead combinations displayed more positive MADs responses between 45° and 0°. Experience with female substances showed that male beetles showed high responses to female scent. According to the study, 43 of the 49 runs where female smear was used had a response score of 5 in contrast to the 23/42 runs without female smear receiving a score of 5.

Colorado potato beetles are also attracted to the volatiles potato plants emit. In the article &quot;Sexual contact influences orientation to plant attractant in Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)&quot; by Joseph Dickens, the beetles were attracted to kairomone substance but after mating, their attraction to it reduced. Within 24 hours of mating, there was no difference between levels of attraction to kairomone and control solvent. Lack of attraction occurred for two days but resumed three days after mating. Male beetles produce a pheromone that is further enhanced by plant host volatiles like the kairomone. After a beetle is attracted to the host, mating occurs and the female lays her eggs on the plant. The beetles&#x27; attraction to kairomone decreases until 72 hours later once oviposition occurs and the probability of re-mating increases.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Diet===
&quot;L. decemlineata&quot; has a strong association with plants in the family Solanaceae, particularly those of the genus &quot;Solanum&quot;. It is directly associated with &quot;Solanum cornutum&quot; (buffalo-bur), &quot;Solanum nigrum&quot; (black nightshade), &quot;Solanum melongena&quot; (eggplant or aubergine), &quot;Solanum dulcamara&quot; (bittersweet nightshade), &quot;Solanum luteum&quot; (hairy nightshade), &quot;Solanum tuberosum&quot; (potato), and &quot;Solanum elaeagnifolium&quot; (silverleaf nightshade). They are also associated with other plants in this family, namely the species &quot;Solanum lycopersicum&quot; (tomato) and the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot; (pepper).

===Enemies===

At least 13 insect genera, three spider families, one phalangid (Opiliones), and one mite have been recorded as either generalist or specialized predators of the varying stages of &quot;L. decemlineata&quot;. These include the ground beetle &quot;Lebia grandis&quot;, the coccinellid beetles &quot;Coleomegilla maculata&quot; and &quot;Hippodamia convergens&quot;, the shield bugs &quot;Perillus bioculatus&quot; and &quot;Podisus maculiventris&quot;, various species of the lacewing genus &quot;Chrysopa&quot;, the wasp genus &quot;Polistes&quot;, and the damsel bug genus &quot;Nabis&quot;.

The predatory ground beetle &quot;L. grandis&quot; is a predator of both the eggs and larvae of &quot;L. decemlineata&quot;, and its larvae are parasitoids of the pupae. An adult &quot;L. grandis&quot; may consume up to 23 eggs or 3.3 larvae in a single day.

In a laboratory experiment, &quot;Podisus maculiventris&quot; was used as a predatory threat to female &quot;L. decemlineata&quot; specimens, resulting in the production of unviable trophic eggs alongside viable ones; this response to a predator ensured that additional food was available for newly hatched offspring to increase their survival rate. The same experiment also demonstrated the cannibalism of unhatched eggs by newly hatched &quot;L. decemlineata&quot; larvae as an antipredator response.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
Colorado potato beetles exhibit sexual dimorphism. In particular, they exhibit dimorphism in the adhesive tarsal setae. The paper &quot;Sexual dimorphism in the attachment ability of the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) to rough substrates&quot; by Voigt demonstrates this dimorphism. The setae, hair-like structures, in males is to help them adhere to the females&#x27; elytra when mating. Colorado potato beetles also have adhesive setae that allows them to attach to host plants.

Three current setae are known: simple pointed with an asymmetric narrowing at the tip (males and females), spatula-like with a pin on its dorsal surface (males and females), setae with an adhesive terminal disc (males only). Male setae are better designed for smooth surfaces; male Colorado potato beetles have been observed attaching onto smooth glass and plastic surfaces and also attach to the smooth female elytra.

Microscopy of the tarsal reveals five articulated tarsomeres and paired curved claws. Males and females have an adhesive setae covering the first three tarsomeres. The fourth is hidden and the fifth bears sensory setae with no adhesive function. Both males and females have filamentous with a tapered terminal part, lanceolate with a flattened tapered terminal part, and spatula-shaped with an enlarged tape-like terminal part. Males have a discoidal terminal part with a bulge around the disc. Female elytra appears smooth on the surface, but further magnification shows irregular lines. This indicates fluid on the elytra.

== Genetics ==

=== Genetic differentiation from agriculture ===
Colorado potato beetles display genetic differentiation based on region. In the Columbia Basin and Central Sands, beetles in the Columbia Basin had less genetic diversity than those in Central Sands. According to the study done by Crossly, Rondon, and Schoville, in the paper &quot;Effects of contemporary agricultural land cover on Colorado potato beetle genetic differentiation in the Columbia Basin and Central Sands,&quot; nucleotide diversity in the Columbia Basin beetles ranged from 0.0056-0.0063 and 0.0073-0.0080 in Central Sands. Heterozygosity data showed the Columbia Basin was 19.4% ± 0.4% and 21.6% ± 0.8% in the Central Sands. Additional mitochondrial DNA sequencing showed two haplotypes in the Columbia Basin compared to places like Wisconsin showed seven haplotypes.

Reasoning behind the genetic diversity is the landscapes of the regions: shrub-land and grains in the Columbia Basin versus the forest, corn, and beans in the Central Sands. In the same study, potatoes covered 3.5% in the Columbia Basin and 1.8% in the Central Sands. Landscape resistance can be characterized by how the land responds to the spread of beetles. Its overall effect on allele frequency covariance was low, and the Central Sands had a higher rate of decay in allele frequency. Potatoes&#x27; relative effect sizes of land cover variables on genetic differentiation was the highest in the Columbia Basin. However, when comparing all the land types, no particular land cover displayed any significant difference from the others.

Genetic differentiation in the Colorado potato beetle can be impacted by agricultural practices such as crop rotation. The same study mentioned earlier examines crop rotation&#x27;s effects on genetic differentiation in Colorado potato beetles that were not found in the Central Sands. On the other hand, genetic diversity decreased with increased crop rotation in the Columbia Basin. This difference could be attributed to larger rotation differences in the Columbia Basin or differences in the landscape itself that affect the spread of the beetles. Genetic diversity is not directly impacted by the land cover type. Instead, other factors such as climate could be responsible for the differences between the Colorado potato beetle in these two regions.

=== Genetic differentiation due to invasion ===
The Colorado potato beetle has invaded North America and Europe. Because of its widespread invasion, the Colorado potato beetle displays genetic diversity in its different regions. In the paper &quot;The voyage of an invasive species across continents: genetic diversity of North American and European Colorado potato beetle populations&quot; by Grapputo, Boman, Lindström, and Mappes, sequencing of amplified mtDNA from 109 beetles in 13 populations showed 20 unique haplotypes. Three haplotypes were shared in the populations and all others were restricted to a single population in North America. 51 European beetles collected from eight populations yielded in one haplotype that was also fixed in the Idaho population. Mitochondrial data, mtDNA, of North American beetles showed significant population differentiation. For example, 44% of the variation can be attributed to subdivision among populations, especially in Kentucky and Idaho.

Polymorphism was highest in Colorado potato beetles in Colorado and the lowest was in France. Polymorphism and heterozygosity was higher in North America than in Europe. Heterozygosity ranged from 0.25 in New Brunswick to 0.14 in France. Further analysis revealed population differentiations between North America and Europe. There were two separate groups of European beetles, one formed by western European beetles and the second being eastern European beetles. 13% of total variation is from variation among the two continent groups, and 17% of variation is from population variance within groups. Beetles from North American and Europe formed clusters. With the exception of New Brunswick and Kentucky beetles, most beetles from the same population cluster together. In Europe, there were more complex relations between the beetles. Estonian and Spanish beetles clustered, French and Italian beetles formed separate groups, and Russian and Finnish beetles were closely related to Estonian ones. European beetles could be categorized by East and West except for Polish beetles which had relations to multiple countries.

===Importance of transposable elements in genome===
To help explain why Colorado Potato beetles are such difficult agricultural pests to manage and control, a group of researchers sought to test both structural and functional genetic changes in the species of beetle as compared to other arthropod species. Using community annotation, transcriptomics, and genome sequencing, they uncovered that Colorado Potato beetles have a genome consisting of several transposable elements. Transposons are sequences of genetic material that can shift/move their place within an organism&#x27;s genome, and 17% of the Colorado Potato beetles’ genome consists of transposable elements. This helps explain their rapid evolution to continually resist insecticides, contributing to their global spread.

==As an agricultural pest==
=== Factors affecting beetle dispersal ===
Colorado potato beetles are highly mobile and are considered pests. Colorado potato beetles disperse to hosts via walking and flight. Flights have three types: short, long, and diapause. Diapause is a long-distance flight that occurs at the end of the summer. In order for dispersal to occur, certain conditions need to be met, both abiotic and biotic.

=== Abiotic conditions ===
Abiotic factors include temperature, photoperiod, insolation, wind, and gravity. A soil temperature of 9 °C causes soiled beetles to move up. They emerge when soil surface temperature is 14–15 °C. Optimal flight takeoff temperature is 27 °C. Long photoperiods enable proper flight-muscle development. Insolation is also important for flight; at least 6 hours of insolation paired with 25–28 °C temperatures are optimal for takeoff. Wind is another condition that needs to be met. Speeds of 1–3 m/s assist with takeoff for short-distance flights. Gravity can also affect flight speed in the beetles; as the Colorado potato beetle moves out of soil, it does so on slopes of 20° or more.

=== Biotic conditions ===
Biotic conditions include availability of energy reserves, insect weight, insect density, overwintered adults, and summer adults. It is speculated that proline is the primary energy substance for Colorado potato beetles in flight. Beetles that gain more than 15% of their weight after emerging fly less and for shorter distances than beetles that remain the same weight. Wing loadings for male and female beetles were 10.83 and 15.60 N/m2. Wing loading changes as beetles feed, drink, and develop eggs. Cases of large groups of beetles leaving crops have been observed when there is higher population density. However, this is likely due to destruction of the food source, not the population itself. Overwintered beetles exhibit different behavior than summer beetles. They typically fly less because it is an adaptation to the higher risks of food deprivation in the spring compared to summer. During the summer, the adults that emerge walk until they eat enough to develop proper flight muscles and develop a proper elytra.

=== Motivations for dispersal and stimuli ===
Colorado potato beetles walk in orientations to find food. In the dark, they walk at slow speeds and in circles. Beetles also move in response to olfactory cues. The beetles respond and move faster to familiar odors. Depending on satiation levels, the beetles move differently with the winds. A parallel walk with the wind is found in satiated beetles whereas starved beetles walk against it.

Visual cues are also important for the beetles. Colorado potato beetles respond to light, and intensity is proportional to rest period. Beetles exhibit phototactic orientation in which they align themselves with a cone of light and move with it. Compass orientation is when large amounts of beetles walk in a single direction and have memory of their angle to the sun.

The rate of linear displacement is important for the probability of the beetle finding a plant, mate, or habitat. This is important for the success of orientation mechanisms.

New beetles disperse for crops once they emerge. The crops affect colonization: crop rotation prolongs colonization, and neighboring crops are colonized rapidly and by walking. Overwintered beetles fly to find crops and once a host plant is found, flight frequency decreases. The strategy behind this is thought to be minimizing reproductive risk because female beetles that emerge in the spring are already mated. Dispersal continues after finding a host. Moving helps beetles find better resources, mates, and progeny distribution. When moving, flight is less frequent than walking in cultivated fields than in the wild.

Researchers have also evaluated how flight frequency is related to the beetle&#x27;s diet. In a beetle population that had returned from diapause and been exposed to poor food conditions, mean flight frequency was decreased. This is because beetles required better food conditions to regenerate their flight muscles. Prior to diapause, beetles increased their flight frequency to compensate for poor food conditions.

===Potato crop pest===
Around 1840, &quot;L. decemlineata&quot; adopted the cultivated potato into its host range and it rapidly became a most destructive pest of potato crops. It is today considered to be the most important insect defoliator of potatoes. It may also cause considerable damage to tomato and aubergine crops with both adults and larvae feeding on the plant&#x27;s foliage. Larvae may defoliate potato plants resulting in yield losses up to 100% if the damage occurs prior to tuber formation. Larvae may consume 40 cm2 of potato leaves during the entire larval stage, but adults are capable of consuming 10 cm2 of foliage per day.

The economic cost of insecticide resistance is significant, but published data on the subject are minimal. In 1994, total costs of the insecticide and crop losses in the US state of Michigan were $13.3 million, representing 13.7% of the total value of the crop. The estimate of the cost implication of insecticides and crop losses per hectare is $138–368. Long-term increased cost to the Michigan potato industry caused by insecticide resistance in Colorado potato beetle was estimated at $0.9 to $1.4 million each year.

=== Potato protection ===

Colorado potato beetles pose significant dangers to potatoes, which are a quintessential agricultural crop. In response to the damage they do, some potatoes have been genetically modified to resist attack and damage from the beetles. Specifically, the Russet Burbank Potato. The insertion of a &quot;cryIIIA&quot; gene that codes for the insect control protein &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis var. Tenebrionis&quot; is the method that was used. Prior to its insertion, research showed that wild-type &quot;cryIIIA&quot; genes were expressed in low levels in plants. Plants with this gene expressed the &quot;cryIIIA&quot; protein at levels less than 0.001% of total leaf protein. Plants contain some resistance and toxicity to the Colorado potato beetles, but consistent protection requires higher levels of expression of the &quot;cryIIIA&quot; gene. Scientists modified &quot;cryIIIA&quot; by modifying the DNA protein-coding sequence without altering the amino acid sequence. The gene was transferred into the potato through a vector, specifically a &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; mediated transfer. 

Following the introduction of the gene, Russet Burbank potato plants with the gene were tested for kanamycin resistance and Colorado potato beetle resistance. In 308 plants that were tested, 18% (55) displayed complete resistance to the beetle. Later larval stages and adult beetles are more sensitive to &quot;cryIIIA&quot; protein. Controlling adults is important because they produce the next larvae generation. Colorado potato beetles overwinter as adults in the soil and feed immediately after emerging in the spring. In &quot;cryIIIA&quot; expression levels above 0.005%, adult feeding was negligible. Oviposition was also affected. In non-transgenic leafs, mean number of eggs per cage were 117 and 143 in two separate trials. On the other hand, transgenic leafs displayed a mean of 1.7 and 0 eggs per cage in two trials. The female beetles were also studied, and the beetles put in the cage with transgenic plants displayed reduced size with ova that were partially or totally reabsorbed. They absorbed body fat and reproductive tissue as a result of ceasing consumption of transgenic plants.

The potatoes showed benefits of the gene treatment; potatoes expressing the &quot;cryIIIA&quot; gene had protection from Colorado potato beetles in the laboratory and the field. Furthermore, these potato plants displayed agronomic and tuber characteristics that aligned with healthy Russet Burbank Potatoes.

===Insecticidal management===
The large-scale use of insecticides in agricultural crops effectively controlled the pest until it became resistant to DDT in 1952 and dieldrin in 1958. Insecticides remain the main method of pest control on commercial farms. However, many chemicals are often unsuccessful when used against this pest because of the beetle&#x27;s ability to rapidly develop insecticide resistance. Different populations in different geographic regions have, between them, developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide, although not every population is resistant to every chemical. The species as a whole has evolved resistance to 56 different chemical insecticides. The mechanisms used include improved metabolism of the chemicals, reduced sensitivity of target sites, less penetration and greater excretion of the pesticides, and some changes in the behavior of the beetles.

CPBs have evolved widespread insecticide resistance. No cases without fitness cost or of negative cost are known.

===Nonpesticidal management===
Bacterial insecticides can be effective if application is targeted towards the vulnerable early-instar larvae. Two strains of the bacterium &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; produce toxins that kill the larvae. Other forms of pest control, through nonpesticidal management are available. Feeding can be inhibited by applying antifeedants, such as fungicides or products derived from Neem (&quot;Azadirachta indica&quot;), but these may have negative effects on the plants, as well. The steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy (&quot;Tanacetum vulgare&quot;) contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone, and these chemicals are strongly repellent to &quot;L. decemlineata&quot;.

&quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot; (Hyphomycetes) is a pathogenic fungus that infects a wide range of insect species, including the Colorado potato beetle. It has shown to be particularly effective as a biological pesticide for &quot;L. decemlineata&quot; when used in combination with &quot;B. thuringiensis&quot;.

Crop rotation is, however, the most important cultural control of &quot;L. decemlineata&quot;. Rotation may delay the infestation of potatoes and can reduce the build-up of early-season beetle populations because the adults emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking. One 1984 study showed that rotating potatoes with nonhost plants reduced the density of early-season adults by 95.8%.

Other cultural controls may be used in combination with crop rotation: Mulching the potato crop with straw early in the growing season may reduce the beetle&#x27;s ability to locate potato fields, and the mulch creates an environment that favours beetle&#x27;s predators; Plastic-lined trenches have been used as pitfall traps to catch the beetles as they move toward a field of potatoes in the spring, exploiting their inability to fly immediately after emergence; flamethrowers may also be used to kill the beetles when they are visible at the top of the plant&#x27;s foliage.

=== Biological management ===
Some potential sources of control for the Colorado golden beetle is the eulophid egg parasitoid &quot;Edovum puttleri&quot;. This parasitoid can kill more than 80% of beetle eggs. It does it by parasitization, probing, and host feeding. &quot;Edovum&quot; specializes in the Colorado potato beetle, which gives it easier access to the eggs it eats. This parasitoid tolerates warmer temperatures than the beetle. The adults hunt during the warmest part of the day and have different food sources. The young feast on beetle eggs. Furthermore, these parasitoids do not overwinter which means using them for biological control raising them in insectaries and periodic releases. However, there are studies that attempt to genetically improve &quot;Edovum&#x27;s&quot; tolerance to colder temperatures along with cultural manipulations that enable &quot;Edovum&quot; to provide useful, economic biological control.

Another enemy/potential control method is a fungal pathogen called &quot;Beuveria bassiana&quot;. This fungus has implications in population control of the beetles. It cannot be used to quickly contain large populations of beetles. Additionally, the pre-existing use of fungicide in disease management of crops presents an obstacle for the effectiveness of the fungus. Other reasons as to why this fungal treatment has not been utilized heavily include costs of production and longevity of formulations.

===Spatial and temporal field management===
Colorado Potato beetles have also shown a capacity for spatial and temporal within-field management. In one study, populations of immigrating Colorado Potato beetles were systematically targeted and their established perimeter was measured over a large field. Researchers found that immigrating adult beetles had almost no spatial dependence in any covariance-based treatment, while larval immigrant populations developed the highest densities in field centers. Results imply that perimeter tactics employed by Colorado Potato beetles can give valuable insight into site-specific resistance management programs to optimize insecticide usage. However, researchers are still not confident about the long-term effects of such resistance management programs as yield reduction requires further studying.

==Relationship with humans==
===Cold War villain===
During the Cold War, some countries in the Warsaw Pact claimed that the beetles had been introduced by the CIA in an attempt to reduce food security by destroying the agriculture of the Soviet Union. A widespread campaign was launched against the beetles; posters were put up and school children were mobilized to gather the pests and kill them in benzene or spirit.

===Philately===
&quot;L. decemlineata&quot; is an iconic species and has been used as an image on stamps because of its association with the recent history of both North America and Europe. For example, in 1956, Romania issued a set of four stamps calling attention to the campaign against insect pests, and it was featured on a 1967 stamp issued in Austria. The beetle also appeared on stamps issued in Benin, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates, and Mozambique.

===In popular culture===
Neapolitan mandolins (also called Italian mandolins) are often called &quot;tater bugs&quot;, a nickname given by American luthier Orville Gibson, because the shape and stripes of the different color wood strips resemble the back of the Colorado beetle.

The fans of Alemannia Aachen carry the nickname &quot;Kartoffelkäfer&quot;, from the German name for the Colorado beetle, because of striped yellow-black jerseys of the team.

During the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, the word , from the Ukrainian and Russian term for Colorado beetle (, ), gained popularity among Ukrainians as a derogatory term to describe pro-Russian separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts (provinces) of Eastern Ukraine. The nickname reflects the similarity of black and orange stripes on St. George&#x27;s ribbons worn by many of the separatists.

In some European cultures, the Colorado potato beetle is known as the &#x27;gourd beetle&#x27; due to the likeness of the beetle to various gourds of the Cucurbitaceae family.

<text>The San Francisco Opera (SFO) is an American opera company founded in 1923 by Gaetano Merola (1881–1953) based in San Francisco, California.

==History==

===Gaetano Merola (1923–1953)===
Merola&#x27;s road to prominence in the Bay Area began in 1906 when he first visited the city. In 1909, he returned as the conductor of the International Opera Company of Montreal, one of the many visiting troupes that frequented the bustling city. Continued visits over the next decade convinced him that an opera company in San Francisco was viable.

Merola moved back into the city in 1921 while living with Mrs. Oliver Stine&#x27;s support Oliver Stine. He drafted plans for a new, locally-owned opera company that would not rely on visiting troupes, a common practice for some opera companies since the Gold Rush. By the next year, Merola organized a trial season at Stanford University. The first performance occurred in the Stanford Cardinal&#x27;s football stadium on June 3, 1922, with operatic tenor Giovanni Martinelli performing in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, &quot;Carmen&quot;, and &quot;Faust&quot;. 

The five-day season&#x27;s lacked any financial success; Merola instead successfully raised funds for a full season of opera in the following year. Following this, the first unaffiliated performance given by the San Francisco Opera was &quot;La bohème&quot;, with Queena Mario and Giovanni Martinelli, on September 26, 1923, in the city&#x27;s Civic Auditorium.

In subsequent years, SFO would perform a wide array of Italian operas, rarely performing a given opera more than once. SFO seasons seldom lasted more than two months, and occasionally performed less than one month. The 1923–24 season included productions of &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; and &quot;Mefistofele&quot; with Beniamino Gigli, &quot;Tosca&quot; with Giuseppe De Luca and Martinelli, and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; with Queena Mario, De Luca, and Gigli.

During the nine years following the opening season, the San Francisco War Memorial Opera House was designed by Arthur Brown Jr.

On October 15, 1932, the company inaugurated the new opera house with a performance of &quot;Tosca&quot; on with Claudia Muzio in the titular role. Characteristic of Merola&#x27;s years as general director was the fact (as noted by Chatfield-Taylor) that &quot;the great singers of the world came regularly to San Francisco, often performing several roles in deference to the short season and long travel time across the country.&quot;

Edwin MacArthur led the San Francisco Opera Orchestra in several 78-rpm recordings for RCA Victor in the late 1930s, including performances by soprano Kirsten Flagstad. Some of these were later reissued by RCA on LP and CD.

Short versions of all the works in the season were broadcast on about 30 California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and British Columbia radio stations, starting about 1941.

Merola&#x27;s tenure lasted 30 years. Characteristics of Merola&#x27;s SFO included creating opportunities for young American singers regardless of the fact that the opera lacked a formal training program at that time, and also regular tours by the SFO to Los Angeles between 1937 and 1965, which expanded the season into November. However, until well after Merola&#x27;s death on August 30, 1953, while conducting an open-air concert at Stern Grove, the main San Francisco season rarely extended beyond late October.

===Kurt Herbert Adler (1953–1981)===

Kurt Herbert Adler (1905–1988) came to the United States in 1938 after early experience and training in many aspects of music and theatre in Austria, Germany, and Italy. For five years, he worked to build the chorus of the Chicago Opera Company. Merola heard of him and, over the telephone, invited him to San Francisco opera in 1943 as chorus director.

Adler was often regarded as a difficult, sometimes tyrannical person to work for. However, as Chatfield-Taylor notes, &quot;singers, conductors, directors, and designers came back season after season. They came back because Adler made the SFO an internationally respected company that ran at a high level of professionalism and offered them interesting things to do in a warm and supportive atmosphere.&quot; Among those who were offered new and exciting challenges were Geraint Evans, the Welsh baritone, Leontyne Price, and Luciano Pavarotti.

He took on more and more administrative details as Merola&#x27;s health and energy diminished, but Adler was not the board&#x27;s natural choice to replace Merola at the time of his death in 1953. After three months of acting as artistic director, and with the assistance of its president, Robert Watt Miller, Adler was confirmed as general director.

====Adler&#x27;s aims====

Adler&#x27;s had several aims in taking over the company. One was to expand the season which in Merola&#x27;s time ran. It changed from the Friday after Labor Day until early November (when the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s season began). This was to capitalize on the availability of singers by presenting up to fourteen operas with two or three performances each. Eventually, as seen in the 1961 SFO season, eleven operas were given five or six performances each on average while the season ran to late November.

Another aim was to present new talent, and, for this, he was tireless in seeking out up-and-coming new singers, whether American or European, by attending performances in both major and minor opera houses. He heard Leontyne Price on the radio and offered her a role in &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot; in 1957, thus providing her with her first performance on a major operatic stage. A short time later in the same season, she was to step into the role of Aida at short notice to replace Antonietta Stella, a role which gave her long-lived international acclaim.

Adler developed a strong professional relationship with Birgit Nilsson. Nilsson made her US-debut in San Francisco in 1956. She returned almost every season for 26 years and made her last appearance in the house in 1982.

A characteristic of the Adler years was the interest in developing stronger connections to opera stage directors in an attempt to strengthen the dramatic and theatrical elements of the works. In this, he was greatly supported by his long relationship with Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, the often-controversial stage director and designer who began his association with SFO in 1957.

====Merola Opera Program====

Several innovations undertaken by Adler included the Merola Opera Program (named after the first general director). It began during the 1954/55 Season and was given its current name in 1957. The program now annually offers approximately 23 gifted singers, four apprentice coaches, and one apprentice stage director the rare opportunity of studying, coaching, and participating in master classes with established professionals for eleven weeks during the summer. Many went on to international careers, among them Carol Vaness and Thomas Hampson.

====Opera in the Park====
Another innovation was &quot;Opera in the Park&quot; which, since 1971, has been an annual free concert in Golden Gate Park on the Sunday following opening night of the Fall Season. It traditionally features artists from the opening weekend in full concert with the San Francisco Opera Orchestra. The event is open to the public and draws some 30,000 listeners. The concert is presented in conjunction with the non-profit San Francisco Parks Trust and the San Francisco Chronicle Charities.

====Success of the company====

By the 1970s, the company was highly successful and offered audiences the &quot;cream of the crop&quot; of internationally known singers, but with Adler often bringing in unknowns to make their American debuts or the surprise of well-known singers replacing ailing ones, there were some exciting nights at the opera. These included Plácido Domingo flying with no notice from New York City to San Francisco – albeit three hours after curtain time – to replace the ailing Carlo Cossutta on the opening night of &quot;Otello&quot; and the last-minute substitution by Leontyne Price for Margaret Price in the role of Aida.

From 1971 to 1979, San Francisco station KKHI broadcast the regular Friday night performances of the opera on AM and FM (in multiplex stereo with quadraphonic encoding). The broadcasts were hosted by several well-known announcers, including Scott Beach and Fred Cherry.

In the summer of 1972, the San Francisco Opera began its 50th anniversary celebrations with a special free concert in Sigmund Stern Grove. Adler conducted most of the program, which featured performances by many of the surviving singers who had appeared with the company during its history. The legendary tenor Lauritz Melchior conducted the orchestra, rather than sing, in a performance of the famous Radetsky March by Johann Strauss I; it was possibly his last public appearance. One of the highlights of the afternoon program was a moving performance of the love duet from &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; with soprano Licia Albanese and tenor Frederick Jagel.

Adler retired on December 15, 1981.

===Terence McEwen (1982–1988)===

Following Adler&#x27;s retirement announcement in June 1979, Terence A. McEwen (1929–1998) was Adler&#x27;s hand-picked successor. Growing up in the Montreal area of Canada, McEwen learned to love opera at an early age, listened to the Met broadcasts, and at age 14, made a trip to New York one winter break to hear several of his favorite operas, which included Bidu Sayão and Jussi Björling in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. As a singer, Sayão was forever to remain his passion, one which was accentuated by seeing her in &quot;Manon&quot; performances in Montreal.

His passion for opera in general led him to visit the Royal Opera House in London and a lowly paid job with Decca Records in that city. Moving up the ranks in the 1950s, he landed in New York in 1959 and for the next 20 years made London Records, Decca&#x27;s classical arm, the most significant classical label in the United States.

After being approached by Adler regarding the San Francisco opera job, he moved to the city in 1980 and involved himself totally in learning the running of an opera company. In January 1982 McEwen was running the SFO.

Given his expertise and background in understanding opera and the wonders of the human voice, it is not surprising that his approach in his early years was away from the theatrical side and more focused on singers. With his &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; which began in the Summer 1983 and Fall 1984 seasons — and which was presented in its entirety in June 1985 – McEwen demonstrated where his priorities lay: they were focused on hiring the best singers in the world.

As a reaction to the economic climate of the times, in 1982 McEwen, created the &quot;San Francisco Opera Center&quot; to oversee and combine the operation and administration of the numerous affiliate educational and training programs. Providing a coordinated sequence of performance and study opportunities for young artists, the San Francisco Opera Center included the &quot;Merola Opera Program&quot;, &quot;Adler Fellowship Program&quot;, &quot;Showcase Series&quot;, &quot;Brown Bag Opera&quot;, &quot;Opera Center Singers&quot;, &quot;Schwabacher Recitals&quot;, and various Education Programs. By introducing his young singers to the great voices of the past, inviting them to rehearsals, and giving tickets to current productions McEwen hoped to create rounded performers who could appear in the regular Fall season.

Among his successes in this regard was the mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajick from Nevada. By &quot;hand holding&quot; her through the various stages of training, he prepared her for the role of Azucena in &quot;Il trovatore&quot; for the summer 1986 season to great acclaim.

During the 1983 fall season, the student/family matinee performances of &quot;La traviata&quot; were presented with supertitles. These are English translations of the libretto projected over the proscenium simultaneously with the action on stage. The overwhelmingly favorable response prompted the company to introduce the practice in increasing numbers of performances in subsequent seasons. Supertitles are now used for all San Francisco Opera productions and SFO also rents its supertitles internationally to other opera companies.

In 1986, Sir John Pritchard was appointed music director and served until 1989.

On 8 February 1988, McEwen announced his resignation. The following day his mentor, Kurt Herbert Adler, died.

===Lotfi Mansouri (1988–2001)===
Lotfi Mansouri (born 1929) was already a known quantity when Terry McEwen announced his retirement. Then head of the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto, Mansouri had received an education in medicine in Los Angeles, but gave it all up upon becoming fixated on opera, first as a young tenor with UCLA&#x27;s Opera Workshop, and then with opera in general.

As early as 1962, with Mansouri having found work as director in Los Angeles followed by his becoming resident stage director at the Zürich Opera, Adler came to see him at work, and he was offered six operas to direct in the 1963 season. By the time he became general director, he had directed 60 operas for SFO and many others elsewhere.

By 1975 he was director of the Canadian Opera Company where, in 1983, he had introduced the revolutionary supertitles. Mansouri&#x27;s feelings on the effects of titling was that the audience would be more engaged in the performance. This was a momentous change in the world of opera.

Mansouri introduced many new operas to the SFO repertory. These included more Russian operas with the highlight being Valery Gergiev&#x27;s conducting of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; and a firm link established with the Kirov Opera. Also, there was Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot; which followed.

One of Mansouri&#x27;s triumphs was the overseeing of the reconstruction and renovation of the opera house following the October 1989 earthquake. After closing at the end of the 1995 Fall season for &quot;a 21-month, US$88.5 million renovation, San Francisco&#x27;s War Memorial Opera House reopened on 5 September 1997 with a gala concert celebrating this occasion, as well the 75th anniversary of the San Francisco Opera. Fittingly, the concert featured operatic greats of the past, present and future. The project included repairs of damage caused by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, improvements for the audience and performers, seismic strengthening and a general cleanup that left the 65-year-old Opera House gleaming.&quot;

Donald Runnicles was named music director and principal conductor of SFO in 1990, and assumed the posts in 1992.

In November 1992, Mansouri introduced &quot;Pacific Visions&quot;, an ambitious program designed to maintain the vitality of the opera repertoire through new commissions and the presentation of unusual repertoire. It was launched with the commissioning of the following operas:

* &quot;The Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, composed by Conrad Susa to a libretto by Philip Littell, had its world premiere during the 1994 fall season and was the subject of a nationwide TV broadcast. The cast featured Renée Fleming, Frederica von Stade, and Thomas Hampson.
* &quot;Harvey Milk&quot;, composer Stewart Wallace to a libretto by Michael Korie. It was performed in 1996 as a joint commission and co-production of the SFO, Houston Grand Opera, and New York City Opera. The cast featured Raymond Very as Dan White, Robert Orth as Harvey Milk and Gidon Sachs as Mayor Moscone.
* &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, composed by André Previn to a libretto by Philip Littell, after the play by Tennessee Williams. The work had its premiere during the 1998–99 fall season. The cast included Renée Fleming as Blanche DuBois and Elizabeth Futral as Stella, baritone Rod Gilfry as Stanley Kowalski and tenor Anthony Dean Griffey as Mitch.
* &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, composed by Jake Heggie from a libretto by Terrence McNally after the book by Sister Helen Prejean, received its premiere in October 2000. The cast included Susan Graham as Sister Helen Prejean, John Packard as Joe; and Frederica von Stade as Mrs. Patrick de Rocher.
* &quot;The Death of Klinghoffer&quot;(a co-commission between San Francisco Opera, Brussels&#x27; La Monnaie, the Opera de Lyon, the Los Angeles Festival, the Glyndebourne Festival and the Brooklyn Academy of Music), composed by John Adams in 1992. The cast included Janice Felty in 3 roles, James Maddalena as The Captain, and Thomas Hammons as the First Officer.

Summing up his years at the SFO, the San Francisco Chronicle noted: &quot;He&#x27;s never been interested in the &quot;succès d&#x27;estime&quot;, the daring intellectual or theatrical coup that dazzles culture mavens but leaves the general public alienated or bewildered. For Mansouri, a success that doesn&#x27;t put fannies in the seats is no success at all.&quot;

Towards the end of the 2001 season, Mansouri announced his retirement after fourteen seasons with SFO and 50 years in opera.

===Pamela Rosenberg (2001–2005)===
&#x27;s first connection with the San Francisco Opera was as a standee while attending the University of California, Berkeley. She returned to SFO with a background of operatic productions in Germany and, specifically, as head of the Stuttgart Opera.

In January 2001, Rosenberg announced her first artistic initiative for San Francisco Opera, &quot;Animating Opera&quot;, a multi-year plan of interwoven themes and series. These included &quot;Seminal Works of Modern Times&quot;, &quot;The Faust Project&quot;, &quot;Composer Portrait: Janáček/Berlioz&quot;, &quot;Women Outside of Society: Laws Unto Themselves&quot;, &quot;Metamorphosis: From Fairy Tales to Nightmares&quot;, and &quot;Outsiders or Pioneers?: The Nature of the Human Condition&quot;.

Incorporated within the production programming of &quot;Animating Opera&quot; was the America staged premiere of Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Saint-François d&#x27;Assise&quot;, Virgil Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Mother of Us All&quot;, as well as a commission for a new work by John Adams and Peter Sellars entitled &quot;Doctor Atomic&quot;, which premiered on 1 October 2005. Other operas new to the SFO&#x27;s repertoire during her directorship include Busoni&#x27;s &quot;Doktor Faust&quot;, Ligeti&#x27;s &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot; and Janáček&#x27;s &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot;.

After much controversy surrounding her management of the SFO, which included deficits created after the &quot;dot-com&quot; collapse in 2000 and the effects of September 11 on arts attendance, she announced in 2004 that she would not renew her contract with the company when it ended in late 2005.

As noted by Steven Winn in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; in December 2005, &quot;Productions were scuttled or postponed in the face of a $7.7 million deficit. Ambitious programming initiatives and plans for a second, smaller performance venue went by the wayside. Company-wide cuts pared 14 percent from the company&#x27;s $67 million budget in 2003.&quot;

He continued: &quot;Embattled by financial woes and trying labor negotiations, Rosenberg was routinely blamed for problems that were largely beyond her control. Her taste for new and unusual operas and a European-honed aesthetic that favored brash and even radical reinterpretations of the classics, the thinking went, drove away audiences and donors and ran up costs in the company&#x27;s hour of greatest need.&quot;

Rosenberg returned to Germany to work with Sir Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic as its &quot;Intendantin&quot;. From 2004 to 2007, Keith Cerny served as the chief financial officer of the San Francisco Opera.

===David Gockley (2006–2016)===
After 33 years of directing the Houston Grand Opera, David Gockley became the SFO&#x27;s General Director on 1 January 2006. As part of an announcement of the 2006/2007 season and the future of the company on 11 January, Gockley noted that &quot;this season we debut a new visual identity and logo in keeping with a new artistic philosophy. I believe that it speaks of glamour, sophistication, tradition and innovation all things that infuse our plans for the future of San Francisco Opera.&quot;

In May 2011, it was announced that Gockley&#x27;s contract was to be extended through SFO&#x27;s 2015–16 season. In October 2014 it was announced that Gockley would be stepping down from his post at the end of the 2015/16 season. His replacement was announced to be Matthew Shilvock in September 2015.

====Innovations announced====
As part of his future plans, Gockley stated &quot;I want nothing less than to have the greatest stars of the opera world perform here regularly. You can expect in coming seasons to hear Renée Fleming, Anna Netrebko, Thomas Hampson, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Marcello Giordani, Ramón Vargas, Marcelo Álvarez, Juan Diego Flórez, Ben Heppner, Natalie Dessay, and Angela Gheorghiu, among many others. We will have a world premiere for you in 2007, and the Wagner lovers among you will be happy to hear that we expect to commence a &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; in 2008.&quot;

Ring Cycle

San Francisco Opera and Washington National Opera began a co-production of a new &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; in 2006 directed by Francesca Zambello. The production used imagery from various eras of American history and had a feminist and environmentalist viewpoint. SFO presented &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; in June 2008, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; in June 2010, and three complete &quot;Ring&quot; cycles in June 2011. The complete cycles in June 2011 were conducted by Donald Runnicles and featured cycle role debuts of Mark Delavan (Wotan) and Nina Stemme (Brünnhilde) as well as Jay Hunter Morris (making his role debut in the title role of &quot;Siegfried&quot;) and Ian Storey (making his role debut as Siegfried in &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;.

Technological innovations

In May 2006 Gockley oversaw SFO&#x27;s first simulcast, a live broadcast of a mainstage performance of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; to San Francisco&#x27;s Civic Center Plaza for a crowd of 8,000. Subsequent simulcasts have been presented at Stanford University&#x27;s Frost Amphitheater, four theaters in Northern California, and San Francisco&#x27;s AT&amp;T Park. SFO&#x27;s has simulcast nine operas to AT&amp;T Park since 2007 that have collectively drawn more than 165,000 opera fans.

The technology for the simulcasts and other innovations like OperaVision—a series of screens located throughout the War Memorial Opera House that project close-up shots of the action on stage—is made possible through SFO&#x27;s Koret-Taube Media Suite. Completed in 2007, The Koret-Taube Media Suite is the first permanent high-definition broadcast-standard video production facility installed in any American opera house according to the company&#x27;s website.

In 2007, San Francisco Opera returned to regular broadcasts of its productions on national and international radio., and in December the Opera announced the presentation of four operas in movie theaters across the United States. Following the initial presentation of the four operas in movie theaters in 2008, San Francisco Opera used these four titles to create its Grand Opera Cinema Series, making these titles available to be presented by performing arts centers, theaters, and universities. Since 2008 the company has added eight additional operas to the Grand Opera Cinema Series, and they have been presented by KQED-TV with hosts Rita Moreno and Joan Chen.

====Music directors and conductors under Gockley====
In September 2006, it was announced and reported that by mutual agreement with Gockley, Donald Runnicles would conclude his tenure as music director in 2009. However, he has maintained an association with SFO and conducted the 2010/11 production of &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; as well as 2015&#x27;s &quot;Les Troyens&quot;.

On 9 January 2007, SFO announced its third music director would be the Italian conductor Nicola Luisotti, beginning with the 2009/10 season, for an initial contract of 5 years. Luisotti made his SFO debut in 2005 with &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, and returned in 2008 to conduct &quot;La bohème&quot; prior to assuming the role of music director. In SFO&#x27;s September 2009 program magazine, David Gockley announced that bringing on Luisotti as the company&#x27;s music director was a large part of his goal to &quot;reinvigorate the core Italian repertory that is San Francisco Opera&#x27;s birthright.&quot; Gockley also stated that Luisotti would conduct three to four productions each season, including one non-Italian opera; since 2009 these non-Italian operas have included &quot;Salome&quot;, &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, and &quot;Carmen&quot;.

In January 2009, Gockley announced the reappointment of Patrick Summers as principal guest conductor and named Giuseppe Finzi as the company&#x27;s new assistant music director. Finzi was named as SFO&#x27;s resident conductor in 2011.

====Programming====
The company secured composer John Adams&#x27; &quot;Nixon in China&quot; for their 2011/12 season.

San Francisco Opera has presented several world premieres under David Gockley&#x27;s tenure. So far these include Philip Glass and Christopher Hampton&#x27;s &quot;Appomattox&quot; in 2007; Stewart Wallace and Amy Tan&#x27;s &quot;The Bonesetter&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in 2008; and Christopher Theofanidis and Donna Di Novelli&#x27;s &quot;Heart of a Soldier&quot; in 2011. In 2013, the company presented three world premieres: Nolan Gasser and Carey Harrison&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, based on the children&#x27;s book by Frances Hodgson Burnett (and staged in conjunction with UC Berkeley&#x27;s Cal Performances); Mark Adamo&#x27;s &quot;The Gospel of Mary Magdalene&quot;; and Tobias Picker and J. D. McClatchy&#x27;s &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;, based on the novel by Stephen King. In the summer of 2015 the world premiere of &quot;La Ciociara&quot; by Marco Tutino and Luca Rossi, based on novel of the same name by Alberto Moravia, took place.

San Francisco Opera&#x27;s recent commissions include &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; by Bright Sheng and David Henry Hwang in the fall of 2016, based on the work of the same name by 18th-century Qing Dynasty writer Cao Xueqin.

====Wilsey Center for Opera====
In order to consolidate its various office and work spaces scattered throughout San Francisco, SFO took over the fourth floor of the War Memorial and Performing Arts Center in February 2016, following the completion of the building&#x27;s $156-million seismic retrofit and renovation. To accomplish this, the company started a campaign to name various locations of the new space after donors in 2011. San Francisco philanthropist Dede Wilsey pledged a $5-million gift, and the entire facility was named the Diane B. Wilsey Center for Opera. Designed by San Francisco architectural firm Mark Cavagnero Associates, the center provides additional office space as well as costume storage; two multipurpose rooms for rehearsals, board meetings, and social events; and a 299-seat performance venue.

<doc id="379216" wikidata="Q18797" url="?curid=379216" title="Wladimir Klitschko">
<text>Wladimir Klitschko (born 25 March 1976) is a Ukrainian former professional boxer who competed from 1996 to 2017. He held multiple heavyweight world championships between 2000 and 2015, including unified titles between 2008 and 2015. During this time he also held the International Boxing Organization (IBO) and &quot;Ring&quot; magazine titles.

A strategic and intelligent boxer, Klitschko is considered to be one of the greatest heavyweight champions of all time. He was known for his exceptional knockout power, using a strong jab, straight right hand and left hook, quick hand speed, formidable physical strength which he employed when clinching opponents, and his athletic footwork and mobility, unusual for boxers of his size.

As an amateur, Klitschko represented Ukraine at the 1996 Olympics, winning a gold medal in the super-heavyweight division and ending his amateur run with 134 wins and 6 losses. After turning professional later that year, he defeated Chris Byrd in 2000 to win the World Boxing Organization (WBO) heavyweight title. Klitschko&#x27;s first reign as champion ended in an upset knockout loss to Corrie Sanders in 2003, which was followed by another upset knockout loss to Lamon Brewster in 2004. It was during this time that Klitschko hired Emanuel Steward as his trainer, which began an eight-year partnership that lasted until Steward&#x27;s death in 2012. In particular, Steward was credited with Klitschko&#x27;s transition from an aggressive puncher to a more defensively-oriented boxer, much as he had done with Lennox Lewis from 1995 to 2003.

From 2004 to 2015, Wladimir and his brother Vitali Klitschko (himself a multiple-time world champion) dominated heavyweight boxing, a period typically known as the &quot;Klitschko Era&quot; of the division. In 2006, Wladimir regained a portion of the world heavyweight championship after defeating Byrd in a rematch to win the International Boxing Federation (IBF) and IBO titles. He won his second WBO title by defeating Sultan Ibragimov in 2008. Following his defeat of Ruslan Chagaev in 2009, Klitschko was awarded the &quot;Ring&quot; title, and lastly he won the World Boxing Association (WBA) title (Unified version, later Super version) from David Haye in 2011. After defeating Alexander Povetkin in October 2013 and until his loss to Tyson Fury in November 2015, Klitschko was recognised as the lineal champion by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB).

For a period of time in late 2015, Klitschko was ranked as the world&#x27;s best active boxer, pound for pound, by BoxRec. He was also ranked among the 10 best boxers in the world, pound for pound, by &quot;The Ring&quot; from 17 August 2010 until 23 November 2015, reaching his career peak of on 25 November 2014, and by the TBRB from 23 February 2013 (TBRB&#x27;s inaugural rankings) until 1 December 2015, reaching his highest ranking of on 22 September 2015.

During Klitschko&#x27;s reign as world heavyweight champion, his fights would reportedly generate up to 500 million viewers worldwide. Klitschko holds records for the longest cumulative heavyweight title reign of all time, with 4,382 days as world heavyweight champion, and most fighters beaten for the world heavyweight championship, at 23. He also holds records for the most wins and title defences of the unified championship in professional boxing history. In 2011, both Wladimir and Vitali entered the Guinness World Records book as brothers with most world heavyweight title fight wins (30 at the time; 40 as of 2020). Klitschko was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame Class of 2021, having been elected in his first year of eligibility.

==Early life==
Klitschko was born in Semipalatinsk, Kazakh SSR, Soviet Union (now Semey, Kazakhstan). He is the son of Nadiia Ulianivna Klychko (née Bulyno) and Volodymyr Rodionovych Klychko (1947–2011), a Soviet Air Force major general and a military attaché of USSR in East Germany. He is the younger brother of former WBC, WBO, and Ring magazine heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko, the current Mayor of Kyiv. Klitschko&#x27;s paternal grandmother was Jewish.

The Klitschko brothers lived as children in Czechoslovakia from 1980 to 1985, where their father was stationed with the Soviet occupation forces. They attended a school designated for children of Soviet soldiers in the town of Mimoň in Northern Bohemia.

The Klitschko brothers lived in Pripyat, Ukrainian SSR from 1985 to 1986, when the town was evacuated following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. The elder Klitschko was also one of the commanders in charge of cleaning up the effects of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 and was afterward diagnosed with cancer. He also served as a military attache at the embassy of Ukraine in Germany. His mother is Nadiya Ulyanivna.

Both Wladimir and Vitali hold PhDs in sports science, with Wladimir&#x27;s dissertation discussing how much training to give to young athletes between 14 and 19 based on the development of their bodies. As a reference to their PhDs, Wladimir is announced as &quot;Dr. Steelhammer&quot;, a nickname similar to his brother, Vitali, who goes by &quot;Dr. Ironfist&quot;.

==Amateur career==
Klitschko started training in amateur boxing with Brovary Olympic Reserve School in the late 1980s. In the early 1990s, Klitschko was coached in Poland&#x27;s Gwardia Warszawa boxing club, where, according to Jerzy Kulej, &quot;He and his brother used to demolish our boys.&quot; In 1993, he won the Junior European Championships as a heavyweight. In 1994, he received 2nd place at the Junior World Championships in Istanbul, Turkey, losing to Cuban Michel López Núñez in the finals. In 1995, he won the gold medal at the Military Championships in Ariccia, Italy, defeating Luan Krasniqi, to whom he had lost in the third round of the World Championships in Berlin, Germany earlier that year. In 1996, he captured 2nd place as a Super Heavyweight at the European Championships in Vejle, Denmark losing to Alexei Lezin on points (1-6) in the finals. He defeated Lezin later that year on points (4-1) in the semi-finals at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Klitschko had an amateur record of 134 wins (65 KO) and 6 losses. Of his six amateur losses, two were by walkover (equivalent to a no-contest in a professional context), three were by points (to Michel López, Alexei Lezin, and Luan Krasniqi, all of whom he defeated in rematches), and one was by RSCI. The latter result happened at the 14th Copenhagen Cup - Copenhagen, Denmark - November 1993, when his bout with Don Diego Poeder was stopped in the first round due to a cut.

He first achieved world attention at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. He defeated Paea Wolfgramm to win the Super-Heavyweight gold medal.

After building an undefeated record of 24–0 with 21 KOs, he suffered his first loss to 24–13–1 Ross Puritty, in what was Klitschko&#x27;s first and only professional fight in Ukraine. Puritty forced Klitschko, who had at that time not gone beyond eight rounds, to punch himself out. Klitschko began to be overwhelmed in the tenth round and went down twice but was allowed to continue. At the start of the eleventh round, with Puritty continuing to land hard punches, Klitschko&#x27;s trainer, Fritz Sdunek, entered the ring and stopped the fight. Three years later, Klitschko&#x27;s brother Vitali stopped Puritty in the eleventh round himself. On 18 March 2000, Klitschko fought Paea Wolfgramm, whom he fought previously in the 1996 super-heavyweight Olympic finals. In their professional rematch, Klitschko knocked Wolfgramm out in the first round.

===Klitschko vs. Byrd, Jefferson, Shufford===
Wladimir Klitschko got his chance to fight for the world heavyweight championship on 14 October 2000 against WBO champion Chris Byrd. Byrd, considered one of the most avoided fighters in the heavyweight division at the time, won the title six months earlier on 1 April from Wladimir&#x27;s brother Vitali (who had a perfect record of 27 fights, 27 wins, 27 KOs coming into the fight), being a late replacement for Donovan Ruddock. In that fight, Byrd was trailing on the scorecards (83–88, 83–88, &amp; 82–89) but was declared the winner after Vitali retired on his stool between 9th and 10th rounds due to shoulder injury. Byrd&#x27;s title defence against Wladimir was scheduled to take place at Kölnarena in Cologne and was billed as &quot;Revenge Of The Brother&quot;. In a fight that was aired on pay-per-view in the United Kingdom, Wladimir won the WBO world heavyweight title from Byrd by a wide unanimous decision (UD) with scores of 120–106, 119–107, and 118–108, flooring his opponent twice.

Klitschko&#x27;s first defence of the WBO title came on 24 March 2001 against Derrick Jefferson. Jefferson, regarded as a big and athletic brawler and a fan-friendly attraction, was coming into the bout with a record of 23 wins in 26 bouts, with 19 of those wins coming inside the distance (18 of them inside the first three rounds, 11 of them - in the first round). Jefferson was mostly known for the sixth-round knockout (KO) of Maurice Harris, which was named &quot;The Ring&quot; Knockout of the Year in 1999. He was 4–2 in the last six fights, losing by technical knockout (TKO) to David Izon, in a fight he was winning on the scorecards but punched himself out, and Oleg Maskaev in round four after breaking an ankle during the first knockdown in the first round.

For the bout, Jefferson weighed in at 260.25 lbs, the heaviest in his professional career and 20 pounds heavier than in his previous bout. The additional weight appeared to be muscle. The fight lasted only two rounds. In the first round, Klitschko knocked Jefferson down with a short left hook. After the first round Jefferson&#x27;s left eye was swollen. Klitschko knocked him down twice more in round two, once with a straight right hand and again with another left hook, with the fight being stopped after the last knockdown, declaring Klitschko the winner by TKO in the second round. Klitschko earned $1 million for the fight.

Klitschko&#x27;s next title defence was scheduled less than five months later on 4 August 2001. The fight took place at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Paradise, Nevada against hometown fighter, Charles Shufford. At the time, Shufford had a 17–1 record, coming off of wins against Jimmy Thunder and Lamon Brewster. Shufford weighed in at 234 lbs., 17 pounds lighter than in his previous bout. Shufford, having played George Foreman opposite Will Smith in the movie &quot;Ali&quot;, entered the ring with Smith by his side. Klitschko knocked Shufford down three times, once in round two, once in round three (both times with a straight right hand) and in round six with a left hook, with referee stopping the bout after the third knockdown. According to punch stats, Klitschko landed 58 of 262 punches (22%) and Shufford connected on 16 of 190 (8%).

===Klitschko vs. Botha, Mercer, McCline===

Klitschko returned to Germany for the next defence of his WBO title against Francois Botha. The fight took place at Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle in Stuttgart, the same venue where Botha had fought Axel Schulz for the IBF title six years earlier, in the most watched boxing match in German TV history. According to Botha&#x27;s coach Abel Sanchez, Botha was in the best shape of his career. The South African contender was game in the opening rounds, trying to catch Klitschko with the right hook, but Klitschko was successfully keeping him at the end of his jab. In the eighth round, Klitschko caught him with a counter right hand and then hit Botha with several shots, knocking him down with a left hook. Botha got up, but was unsteady on his feet and had both eyes swollen, proceeding the referee to stop the bout.

Klitschko had his next title defence scheduled three months later, on 29 June 2002 at Etess Arena in Atlantic City, New Jersey, against former WBO heavyweight champion Ray Mercer. It was the first time in his professional career that Klitschko fought an Olympic Gold medalist. 41-year-old Mercer, having fought Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield throughout his career, was expected to be a tough challenge for Klitschko that would give him and Lennox Lewis, the WBC and &quot;The Ring&quot; champion, a second common opponent (along with Francois Botha) and a bout comparable to Lewis vs. Tyson. During the build-up to the bout, Mercer referred to Klitschko as &quot;Russian Tommy Morrison&quot;. Since his comeback in 2001, Mercer had won four fights over journeymen, three of them inside two rounds, prior to the Klitschko bout.

Klitschko dominated Mercer throughout the entire bout, stopping Mercer in the sixth round. At 2:48 of the first round, Klitschko dropped Mercer with a left hook, becoming only the second man to drop Mercer. Throughout the fight, Klitschko was frequently landing combinations of stiff left jabs, left hooks, and straight right hands. By the fifth round, Mercer&#x27;s face was swollen and his right eye was cut. In the sixth, Klitschko unleashed a barrage of punches, prompting the referee to stop the bout. Klitschko became the first fighter to defeat Mercer inside the distance. According to CompuBox statistics, Klitschko landed 193 total punches out of 429 thrown (104 power punches out of 167), while Mercer landed 54 shots out of 124 (only 5 power punches landed out of 10 thrown).

Klitschko returned to Mandalay Bay Event Center for his sixth defence on 7 December 2002 against Jameel McCline. McCline, having made his professional boxing debut in 1995, became an established contender after defeating Michael Grant, knocking him down with the first punch thrown and ultimately stopping him in 43 seconds. Prior to fighting Klitschko, McCline had defeated two more heavyweight contenders, Lance Whitaker and Shannon Briggs, by wide unanimous decisions. Being 6 ft 6 in tall with an 82 in reach, McCline was of similar height and longer reach than Klitschko, while also being 22 lbs heavier. Many opinion polls gave Klitschko a 60–40 advantage over McCline. The fight was the main event of the card that also featured Floyd Mayweather Jr. defending the WBC lightweight title against Jose Luis Castillo.

The fight turned out to be tentative, with Klitschko winning almost every round using his jab and superior footwork. At the end of the tenth round, Klitschko staggered McCline with a barrage of left hooks and overhand rights, and ultimately knocked him down with a left-right combination. Before the start of the eleventh round, McCline&#x27;s corner threw in the towel, giving Klitschko his 36th career win by stoppage. At the time of the stoppage, the scorecards were 98–91, 99–90 (twice), all in favour of the champion. CompuBox stats showed that Klitschko landed 181 of his 433 punches thrown (42%), and McCline landed 61 of 307 (20%).

The following week after Klitschko&#x27;s win over McCline, Chris Byrd, whom Klitschko defeated for the WBO world title, beat Evander Holyfield to become IBF world champion.

===Klitschko vs. Sanders, Brewster===


After failing to reach agreements with Kirk Johnson, Fres Oquendo, Lou Savarese and Danny Williams, Universum ultimately signed a 4-fight contract with Corrie Sanders, who was ranked No.9 contender by WBO at the time. According to the agreement, Sanders&#x27; first fight was going to be for the WBO world heavyweight title. The fight was scheduled to take place on 8 March 2003 in Hanover, Germany. Klitschko later admitted that he came to the fight unmotivated and was already thinking about the vacation he was going to enjoy after the fight. Klitschko suffered an upset TKO loss to Sanders. With thirty seconds left in the opening round, Wladimir threw a jab but Sanders countered with a big left hook, prompting Klitschko to enter a clinch. While in the clinch, Sanders landed another left hook that send Klitschko to the canvas. Klitschko got up but was dropped again almost immediately. The following round, Sanders continued his assault on a visibly hurt Klitschko, dropping him twice more at the beginning of the round. The referee waived it off after the fourth knockdown. The fight was named Upset of the Year by The Ring for 2003.

After winning two minor bouts in Germany and enlisting the services of legendary boxing trainer Emanuel Steward, Klitschko again fought for the vacant WBO title on 10 April 2004, in Las Vegas, against Lamon Brewster. Klitschko dominated Brewster through the course of the first four rounds, sending him to the canvas in the fourth; however, things turned around in the fifth when Klitschko began tiring and Brewster&#x27;s punches began backing him up. Not defending himself and leaning into ropes for support, Klitschko took a standing eight count. On unsteady legs, Klitschko fell to the canvas after the bell and the referee stopped the fight for his safety. When talking about the fight, Emmanuel Steward said: &quot;Wladimir was in incredible shape. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this in my career. I know what it looks like when a boxer is getting hurt from punches. There was definitely something else that caused problems for Wladimir&quot;.

Shortly after the fight Klitschko was rushed into hospital. An examination showed Klitschko&#x27;s blood sugar level almost two times higher than the permissible norm. According to members of Klitschko&#x27;s team, the doctor told them that Klitschko had been &quot;inches away&quot; from falling into a diabetic coma, and that with blood sugar level that high, Klitschko would&#x27;ve been incapable of handling a single proper training session. After returning from the examination to the hotel, he fell ill with nausea, followed by physical weakness. On 12 April, he arrived in Las Vegas and donated blood and urine samples for an independent examination, which was supposed to be done by Donald Katlin, who specialised in such cases. The examination showed no signs of anabolic steroids in his blood, but Katlin suggested that Klitschko could have been poisoned with Haloperidol. The drug has no taste or smell and causes mental disorders, which are accompanied by impaired coordination, a weakening reaction and overall physical weakness. Following the results, Klitschko demanded the tests taken by the Medical Center of South Nevada and the Nevada Quest Diagnostics to be passed on to Dr. Robert Wow for further research, but the A sample had already been disposed of, while the B sample, which was supposed to be stored for years, disappeared. Dr Margaret Goodman, the chairwoman of the Nevada State Athletic Commission&#x27;s medical advisory board and Nevada&#x27;s chief ringside physician was in the ring and attending to Klitschko seconds after the referee stopped the fight. Her initial diagnosis of a Grade 3 concussion was confirmed at the hospital after further tests. Goodman was sceptical of the theory that Klitschko had been drugged.

As a result of the circumstances that surrounded the fight, FBI started an investigation. Judd Bernstein, the lawyer representing Klitschko, suggested that he was a victim of an ongoing fight fixing in Las Vegas (which also included fraudulent medical reports), which was investigated by FBI at the time. Bernstein, along with some other journalists, pointed out that in the last 48 hours before the beginning of the fight, the betting odds in favour of Klitschko rapidly dropped from 11-to-1 to 3,5-to-1. According to journalist Keith Teixeira, a group of approximately 40 people associated with Brewster&#x27;s manager Sam Simon bet from $50,000 to $100,000 on Brewster&#x27;s victory. Members of Klitschko&#x27;s team also pointed out that shortly before the fight, a security camera recorded a moment when two people entered Klitschko&#x27;s booth and were there for four minutes. These people had badges, but weren&#x27;t members of Wladimir&#x27;s team. Wladimir&#x27;s brother Vitali claimed that during registration of the boxer and his team, the card that belonged to Emmanuel Steward&#x27;s assistant had already been registered on someone else, and that such card would allow its owner to enter any sporting hall in the building.

After the fight, Wladimir&#x27;s cutman Joe Souza was fired. During the fight, Souza used vaseline on Wladimir&#x27;s face but also body, which had never been done in any of Klitschko&#x27;s previous fights. As a replacement, the team hired Jacob &quot;Stitch&quot; Duran.

===Klitschko vs. Williamson, Castillo, Peter===
Following his loss to Brewster, Klitschko began his journey back towards the top of the heavyweight division. First, he faced hard-hitting DaVarryl Williamson. The fight took place at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Williamson dropped Klitschko forty seconds into the second round, but was outboxed throughout the rest of the bout. An accidental head butt in the closing seconds of the fifth round caused Klitschko bleeding from a cut above his right eye. Due to the cut, the fight was prematurely stopped, with Klitschko being declared the winner by technical decision. Two of the judges scored the fight identically 49–46 in favour of Klitschko, while the third judge had Williamson winning 48–47.

After defeating Eliseo Castillo by fourth-round TKO, Klitschko signed to fight Samuel Peter in an IBF and WBO eliminator. Coming into the bout, Klitschko was viewed by many as the underdog against the 7-to-5 favourite Peter who had won all of his 24 fights, with 21 of them having ended inside the distance. At the time, Samuel Peter was considered one of the brightest prospects in the heavyweight division. Distinguished boxing coaches Angelo Dundee and Teddy Atlas expected Peter to win. Wladimir&#x27;s team, including his brother Vitali, were worried about Wladimir, and were against this fight to happen. Wladimir, however, insisted on fighting Peter, claiming that beating a feared, hard-hitting fighter like Samuel Peter would help him to regain his stock and become mandatory challenger for two heavyweight belts.

The first four rounds were tentative, with Klitschko working behind the jab, not allowing Peter to close the distance. At the end of the third, Peter staggered Klitschko with a powerful left hook. He hurt Klitschko again in the fifth with another left hook, sending Klitschko to the canvas with the rabbit punch. The referee counted it as the knockdown. Peter immediately went for the attack after Klitschko got up, dropping him again with the rabbit punch. The referee scored it as the second knockdown. Klitschko regained composure and outboxed Peter through sixth to ninth rounds, with Peter frequently trying to hit Klitschko with the rabbit punch whenever escaping from a clinch. Near the end of the tenth round Peter staggered Wladimir with a hard right hand, eventually sending Klitschko to the canvas with another right when Wladimir was backing away. In the 11th and 12th rounds, Klitschko was trying to keep Peter at the distance using straight punches. Peter caught him with a left hook in the last round, but was unable to capitalise on it. Instead, Klitschko caught him with a hard counter left hook of his own, staggering Peter for the first time in the fight. Eventually the bout went the distance, with Klitschko winning the fight by clear unanimous decision (UD). All the judges scored the bout identically 114–111.

===Klitschko vs. Byrd II, Brock, Austin===
On 22 April 2006, in Mannheim, Germany, Klitschko faced Chris Byrd for a second time, this time for the IBF heavyweight title. At the time of the bout, Byrd was ranked as the best heavyweight by &quot;The Ring&quot;, while Klitschko was ranked eighth. Coming into the fight, Klitschko was viewed as the favourite. Many observers expected Klitschko to dominate Byrd similarly to their first bout.
&quot;(John Hively, boxingscene.com)&quot;

Klitschko defeated Byrd by TKO in the seventh round, becoming a two-time heavyweight world champion in the process. Klitschko dominated the fight using his jab and superior reach, knocking Byrd down twice, once in round five and once in round seven. Byrd beat the count after the second knockdown, but his face was battered and bloody, and the fight was waved off. At the time of the stoppage, judge Roy Francis had the challenger winning every round, while two other judges, Steve Epstein and Robert Hoyle, gave Klitschko all but one round.

In his first title defence, Klitschko agreed to face then-undefeated heavyweight contender Calvin Brock. With a record of 29–0, 22 KOs, Brock was considered one of the most promising and demanded American heavyweight prospects at the time. In an ESPN interview in July 2005, Mike Tyson named him and Samuel Peter as his favourite fighters from the new crop of heavyweights. In the build-up, Brock expressed confidence in his abilities: &quot;I can adopt to every style. He&#x27;s big like Jameel McCline, but a better fighter. I will beat him and become the heavyweight champion of the world. Klitschko has a good jab, but they also said Timur&#x27;s best weapon was his jab. I have a good jab myself. I can adapt to anybody&#x27;s style, anybody&#x27;s strength and turn their weapon against them.&quot; He also dismissed claims that the division lacks strong competition: &quot;The heavyweight division is stacked with a bunch of talent. It&#x27;s not weak, definitely not weak. The division is pretty strong and that&#x27;s why the title keeps changing hands.&quot;

The fight took place on 11 November 2006 at Madison Square Garden. In the opening rounds, Brock&#x27;s economical but effective movement made Klitschko reluctant to throw punches, with Wladimir not being able to fully establish his rhythm. In between the third and fourth rounds, Klitschko&#x27;s trainer Emmanuel Steward urged Wladimir to press the action. Klitschko started fighting more aggressively, hurting Brock several times with the right cross. In the fifth round, Brock opened a cut under Klitschko&#x27;s left eye that started bleeding heavily in the sixth. In the seventh round, Wladimir caught Brock with a counter right hand before sending him to the canvas with another straight right. Brock was able to get up but was unsteady on his feet, prompting the referee to stop the bout.

Klitschko then faced mandatory challenger Ray Austin on 10 March 2007, at the SAP Arena in Mannheim, Germany. 36-year-old Austin was mostly known for draws against Sultan Ibragimov, Larry Donald and Lance Whitaker. In preparation for the fight, Austin was trained by a prominent coach Stacey McKinley. Klitschko won by a second-round KO with four consecutive left hooks to Austin&#x27;s head. Klitschko did not throw a single right hand in that fight.

===Klitschko vs. Brewster II, Ibragimov, Thompson===
Klitschko then avenged one of his previous losses as he defeated Lamon Brewster on 7 July 2007, in Cologne, Germany. Brewster&#x27;s corner asked the referee to stop the fight at the end of the sixth round. It was later revealed that Klitschko fought most of the fight with a broken middle finger on his left hand.

By the end of October 2007, Wladimir Klitschko started negotiations with then-WBO world heavyweight champion Sultan Ibragimov about the unification showdown in the near future. This would be the first heavyweight unification fight since 13 November 1999 when WBC champion Lennox Lewis defeated then-WBA and IBF champion Evander Holyfield. On 20 November, Klitschko and Ibragimov officially signed the contract for their unification clash to take place on 23 February 2008 at Madison Square Garden. Two days later in Moscow, a first pre-fight press-conference was held. Klitschko began his preparations for the fight on 18 December. His training camp was located between Santa Monica, Los Angeles and Palm Beach, Florida. Ibragimov began his preparations for the bout on 25 December. Among Ibragimov&#x27;s sparring partners were Klitschko&#x27;s former opponent Jameel McCline and Swedish heavyweight prospect Attila Levin.

In the pre-fight prediction, a vast majority of Ukrainian, Russian and American observers expected Klitschko to win by either stoppage or unanimous decision. Out of six journalists of the Ukrainian magazine &quot;Ring&quot;, five predicted Klitschko to stop Ibragimov, with only one expecting Klitschko to win by decision. 24 of 26 members of &quot;boxingscene.com&quot; expected Klitschko to come out as the winner – 18 of them predicted the win to come by way of KO/TKO, one expert predicted decision, while the remaining five were unsure about either possibility. The remaining two experts predicted Ibragimov to win by decision. 10 of the 12 members of &quot;ringsidereport.com&quot; picked Klitschko to win, with eight of them expecting the victory to come by way of KO/TKO. The remaining two picked Ibragimov to win by stoppage. In the build-up to the fight, Klitschko&#x27;s trainer Emmanuel Steward said that Sultan Ibragimov was going to be Wladimir&#x27;s toughest opponent to date, praising Ibragimov for his hand speed and mobility, while Klitschko complimented Ibragimov on his accomplishments: &quot;Sultan Ibragimov is a boxer that hasn&#x27;t lost in any of his 23 fights, with the sole draw being against Ray Austin. His amateur career can be described as fantastic, and the fact that he&#x27;s the heavyweight champion of the world speaks volumes about his professional career as well. I think he&#x27;s a strong and dangerous opponent that should not be underestimated. His last two fights against Shannon Briggs and Evander Holyfield proved that.&quot; Ibragimov&#x27;s trainer Jeff Mayweather was confident that Ibragimov would be able to establish his rhythm and &quot;press Klitschko to the corner&quot;. The pre-fight build-up was marked with controversy after Ibragimov&#x27;s manager Boris Grinberg insulted Klitschko during one of the interviews: &quot;Sultan Ibragimov knocks out this Ukraine gay, motherf***er!&quot;. Grinberg later apologised to Klitschko. The day before the bout, Klitschko weighed in at , the lightest since 1999, while Ibragimov&#x27;s weight was , his lightest since 2005.

From the opening bell, both fighters fought tentatively, avoiding risks. Klitschko retreated onto the outside, fighting at a distance and remaining unreachable for Ibragimov who tried to establish his right jab but had his right hand constantly pushed down by Klitschko. By the end of the opening round, Klitschko became more active with his jab, while Ibragimov unsuccessfully tried to catch Wladimir with a series of right and left hooks. By the third round, Klitschko took control of the center of the ring, keeping Ibragimov at the end of his left jab and occasionally throwing right jabs as well. In the fifth round, Klitschko caught Ibragimov with a straight right hand, however Ibragimov appeared to be unhurt. Most of Ibragimov&#x27;s attempts to close distance ended with Klitschko tying him up. In the second half of the fight, the situation did not change, with Klitschko keeping Ibragimov at distance with straight shots, while Ibragimov was only able to occasionally catch Klitschko with single shots to the body. Ibragimov&#x27;s corner was almost silent from the sixth round onwards, unable to give their man any meaningful advice. Klitschko&#x27;s dominance became even more visible after he caught Ibragimov with a straight right in round nine, almost knocking him down. He caught Ibragimov again with a counter left hook at the end of the eleventh. The twelfth round saw Ibragimov unsuccessfully trying to catch Klitschko with overhand shots. Ultimately, the fight went the distance, with Klitschko being declared the winner by unanimous decision. The judges scored the bout 119–110, 117–111 and 118–110. Klitschko reportedly earned $9 million for the fight. He donated $500,000 of his earnings to the Bronx&#x27;s Laureus Sport for Good Foundation.

The fight was heavily criticised by observers and prominent boxing public figures. Boxing promoter Bob Arum called the fight &quot;an absolute shame&quot;, while Dan Goossen described it as &quot;awful&quot;. Boxing journalist Phil Santos pointed out that Klitschko fought for the majority of the fight &quot;only with his left hand&quot;, proving once again that he &quot;is the best heavyweight in the world right now&quot;. Santos also noted that such cautious, safety-first style was not going to help Klitschko to increase his popularity in the United States. Some observers were more apologetic of Klitschko&#x27;s performance: &quot;It&#x27;s really irritating that so many people, people that know very little about boxing, say that Klitschko&#x27;s dominance means stagnation for the heavyweight division. There&#x27;s no denying that once Klitschko collects all the belts, he will go down as one of the all-time greats. Yes, he fights cautiously and isn&#x27;t willing to exchange shots, but who told us that greatness in boxing is measured with the number of knockdowns? Why the boxer that is able to not get hit with a hard shot over the course of twelve rounds is less great than the champions from the past that sacrificed their health for the sake of success?&quot;

On 12 July 2008, Klitschko faced mandatory challenger Tony Thompson. The fight took place at Color Line Arena in Hamburg, Germany, the same venue where Thompson had defeated then-highly regarded German boxer Luan Krasniqi in a WBO world heavyweight title eliminator almost a year prior. In the build-up to the fight, Klitschko praised Thompson for his defensive abilities, while Klitschko&#x27;s trainer Emmanuel Steward described Thompson as &quot;one of the most difficult fights we will have&quot;. In the pre-fight interview, Thompson promised that he wouldn&#x27;t run away from Klitschko, and would stand in front of him and fight toe-to-toe. Being 6 ft 5 in tall with 81½ in reach, Thompson was of similar height and reach as Klitschko. Many observes predicted Thompson to be a tough challenge for Klitschko, expecting Klitschko to ultimately win by TKO in the second half of the fight before the fighters would enter the championship rounds. Coming into the fight, Klitschko weighed in at 241 pounds, 6.5 lbs lighter than Thompson.

The opening rounds were tentative, with Klitschko seemingly struggling with Thompson&#x27;s awkward southpaw style. All three judges gave the first round to Thompson. In the second round, both fighters suffered a cut above the right eye after an accidental headbutt. Klitschko&#x27;s eye began to swell after Thompson caught him with the right hook in the fifth round. After the sixth round, however, Klitschko appeared to have established his dominance in the ring, hurting Thompson with several straight right hands. After the seventh round, both fighters started showing signs of fatigue. In the tenth round, Thompson fell to the canvas during a clinch. It appeared as if Thompson fell down mostly due to being tired rather than being pushed by Klitschko. In the middle of the eleventh, Klitschko caught Thompson with the straight right hand which Thompson did not see coming, falling to the canvas again, with the referee starting the count this time. Thompson beat the count but was unsteady on his feet, prompting the referee to stop the fight. At the time of the stoppage, Klitschko was unanimously winning on the scorecards, with scores 98–92 (twice) and 99–91.

In the post-fight interview, Klitschko admitted that the fight turned out to be tougher than expected: &quot;It is not so easy to defend all the titles and it has been a while since I last had a black eye so today I really look like a boxer. I did not expect the victory to come that hard.&quot; &quot;I was fatigued, I thought he was fatigued too,&quot; Tony Thompson said after the fight. &quot;He did what a great champion did, he took advantage when I was vulnerable. The only thing that hurts on me is my heart – for losing.&quot; Emmanuel Steward described the knockout sequence as the one that showed the difference between a great heavyweight and the best heavyweight in the world: &quot;They were both tired, but Wladimir has experience now, then he came back with a second wind. The experience is what helped Wladimir to come back with the second wind and find an opportunity to secure the stoppage win.&quot; Former undisputed world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis praised Klitschko for his performance: &quot;I&#x27;ve been watching Klitschko for some time, and he&#x27;s improving with every fight.&quot; Meanwhile, unified world cruiserweight champion David Haye criticised the champion for his performance: &quot;If he fights me in the same way he fought that guy he will be knocked out in three rounds. He has got the perfect style for me. I don&#x27;t want him to have any more fights before me as I don&#x27;t want someone else to do what I will do against him.&quot; Klitschko reportedly earned €8 million for the bout.

===Klitschko vs. Rahman, Chagaev, Chambers===
Klitschko was scheduled to defend his titles against Alexander Povetkin later in 2008, but on 25 October, Povetkin withdrew from the fight due to an ankle injury. Instead, Klitschko faced Hasim Rahman on 13 December 2008 and won by TKO. This was the third time Klitschko fought at the SAP Arena in Mannheim, Germany. He dominated the fight, winning every round while making good use of his left jab. Rahman seemed unable to withstand the Klitschko&#x27;s punch power. In the sixth round, Klitschko knocked Rahman down with a series of left hooks, leaving Rahman visibly disoriented. Between the sixth and seventh rounds, the referee warned Rahman he&#x27;s going to stop the fight if Rahman continues absorbing punishment without firing back. The referee ultimately called a stop to the contest in the 7th round after Rahman failed to respond to a series of shots. At the time of the stoppage, Klitschko was leading on all three judges scorecards, respectively 60–53, 60–53, and 60–47. According to CompuBox, Klitschko landed 194 punches (50.4% accuracy) to Rahman&#x27;s 35 (16.8% accuracy), a nearly six-fold disparity.

Klitschko was scheduled to face David Haye on 20 June 2009, but Haye pulled out within weeks of the fight complaining of a back injury. Immediately after news about Haye&#x27;s injury broke into public, a handful of heavyweight fighters, such as Alexander Povetkin, Chazz Witherspoon, James Toney, Odlanier Solis, Dominick Guinn and Eddie Chambers, expressed their interest in replacing Haye for the Klitschko showdown. Instead, Klitschko&#x27;s team started negotiations with Ruslan Chagaev, who was ranked third best heavyweight in the world by &quot;The Ring&quot;, and WBA world champion Nikolai Valuev, who was regarded as a big draw in Germany at the time. Ultimately, Klitschko reached agreements with Chagaev who agreed to step in for Haye as a last-minute replacement (Valuev&#x27;s team wanted the fight to be postponed until autumn of that year). Some observers believed that Chagaev was a better challenge for Klitschko than Haye, given his position in the ranking and the fact that, alongside WBO and IBF world titles, vacant &quot;The Ring&quot; world heavyweight title was also on the line. In the pre-fight comparison, &quot;The Ring&quot; was giving Klitschko an advantage in power, speed and athletic ability, as well as experience, while also crediting Chagaev for having better defence, praising him for his fundamentals and footwork. In terms of technique, both fighters were described as of equal level.

The fight took place at Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen, with over 61,000 fans having attended the fight, the largest audience for a boxing fight in Germany since 1939, when Max Schmeling knocked out Adolf Heuser in front of 70,000 people in Stuttgart. Klitschko dominated the fight, keeping Chagaev at the end of his jab and throwing straight right hand whenever necessary. Klitschko dropped Chagaev near the end of the second round, and was gradually fighting more aggressively as the fight progressed. Chagaev&#x27;s trainer Michael Timm did not allow Chagaev to come out for the tenth round, prompting the referee to wave the bout off, declaring Klitschko the winner by corner retirement (RTD). This win had added significance because even though the WBA title was not on the line, many saw Klitschko as the rightful champion.

On 9 December 2009, Klitschko&#x27;s management group, K2 Promotions, confirmed that a bout with Eddie Chambers had been agreed to take place in Germany on 20 March 2010. This mandatory title defence, originally scheduled for December 2009, had to be delayed due to a hand injury that Klitschko sustained in training that required surgery. In the build-up to the fight, Klitschko described Chambers as &quot;the best American heavyweight right now&quot;. In the pre-fight comparison of the fighters, &quot;The Ring&quot; gave Chambers the upper hand in speed and athletic ability, as well as defence, while crediting Klitschko as more powerful and experienced. In the United States, the bout was not televised by any TV station but was aired on the Klitschko&#x27;s official website for $14.95 instead. The official venue was the multi-functional football stadium ESPRIT Arena in Düsseldorf, Germany.

The bout turned-out to be one-sided, with the champion winning rounds keeping Chambers at the end of his jab and occasionally throwing straight right hands. In the opening rounds, Chambers lifted Klitschko and took him down several times but was not deducted a point nor warned. In between the championship rounds, Klitschko was criticised by his trainer Emmanuel Steward for not fighting aggressively, despite comfortably winning on the scorecards. Klitschko picked up his pace during the final round and, with few seconds left, landed a left hook on Chambers&#x27; temple. The punch made Chambers fall forwards and lose consciousness for an extended period of time. The referee immediately stepped in and called an end to the contest. It remains the only stoppage loss of Chambers&#x27; career.

===Klitschko vs. Peter II===
Following the match with Chambers, a unification fight between Klitschko and David Haye, who, as of November 2009, had held the WBA title, appeared to be in the offing. Klitschko called out the Briton on YouTube in April 2010, stating, &quot;I want to send this message to boxing fans and directly to David Haye. David, you&#x27;ve bitched out on fighting both Klitschko brothers twice already and now&#x27;s the time to make it happen. On behalf of the boxing fans around the world, I am officially calling you out to fight me. You can&#x27;t run away from me forever and you need to follow through with this fight if you want to be respected. I&#x27;m ready. What&#x27;re you waiting for?&quot;

Haye&#x27;s trainer, Adam Booth, indicated that Haye would be willing to accept the challenge. Both sides began negotiations for a potential fight and the bout was targeted for September. As the negotiations continued to move forward, the unification fight between Klitschko and Haye was expected to take place in Germany rather than England. The IBF set a deadline to end negotiations on 17 May. A few days before the deadline, Haye said he was interested in fighting the older Klitschko, Vitali, rather than Wladimir. The fight did not materialise and Klitschko was set to take on mandatory challenger Alexander Povetkin. On 17 May 2010, the 30-day period of negotiation began for Klitschko to defend his championship against Povetkin. Within this period, discussions to make a fight with Haye were still ongoing.

The bout between Klitschko and Povetkin was initially tentatively scheduled to take place in Frankfurt, Germany, on 11 September 2010. In July 2010, it was confirmed that the bout would be taking place in Frankfurt, with Samuel Peter replacing Povetkin for the scheduled fight as Povetkin failed to show up to the press-conference, deciding to pull out of the fight at the advice of his coach Teddy Atlas who believed Povetkin was not ready to face Klitschko. Klitschko faced Peter for the second time, as they had fought in 2005 previously. Peter weighed in at 241 pounds, two pounds lighter than their first fight. Klitschko came in at a career heavy of 247 pounds.

Peter started the fight very aggressively and caught Klitschko with a good left hook in the opening minute, although Klitschko ended the round well. Peter was caught with three hard right-hands in the second round, one of which seemed to stun him. Peter tried to duck under the Klitschko jab, but was being tied up on the inside. After four rounds, the fight became one-sided in Klitschko&#x27;s favour. Peter&#x27;s right eye was closing and he was taking heavy punishment. After the ninth round, Peter&#x27;s trainer Abel Sanchez said he would give him one more round. Emmanuel Steward also implored Klitschko to be more aggressive. Peter swung wildly in the tenth and Klitschko put him down with a concussive combination. Referee Robert Byrd did not start a count and waved the fight off, awarding Klitschko the win by KO. Klitschko reportedly earned €5 million ($6.3 million) for the fight. Klitschko was set to fight Derek Chisora on 11 December, but the fight was later called off on 8 December due to Klitschko tearing a muscle in his abdomen.

===Klitschko vs. Haye===
On 5 January 2011, it was announced that Derek Chisora would get his fight with Klitschko. This enraged David Haye&#x27;s trainer Adam Booth, who described the move as a &quot;disgrace&quot; on a heated live phone-in with Sky Sports News. Booth alleged Haye had met every single one of Klitschko&#x27;s demands. The fight against Chisora was rescheduled for 30 April 2011 and was going to take place in SAP Arena, Mannheim. However, on 4 March, it was announced that Klitschko had pulled out of the fight due to not being fully recovered from a torn abdominal muscle. On 5 March, it was instead announced that the highly anticipated fight against Haye would take place on 2 July 2011. The fight was contingent on Klitschko&#x27;s recovery from a torn abdominal muscle. The contract was written so that if Klitschko was not fully healed, then Haye would fight his brother, Vitali.

Klitschko fought Haye in a heavyweight unification fight for the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, IBO, and &quot;Ring&quot; magazine heavyweight titles. The fight took place at the Imtech Arena in Hamburg, Germany on 2 July 2011. Klitschko and Haye agreed to a 50–50 split of the purse and Haye was allotted 7,000 seats at the venue. Klitschko won by UD, the three judges scored it 117–109, 118–108, and 116–110 all in favour of Klitschko. According to CompuBox, Klitschko landed 134 punches of 509 thrown (26.3% accuracy), while Haye connected on 72 shots out of 290 (24.8%). Klitschko outlanded Haye in every round but fourth. Haye revealed afterwards that he had a broken toe on his right foot, and claimed that it had hindered his game plan for the fight as he felt he was unable to jump out at Klitschko like he had previously in his career. Haye was subject to much derision and ridicule from within the boxing community and fans after citing his toe as part of the reason why he lost. Despite this Klitschko claims that Haye was unable to fight because he was just too good for him.
 Both Klitschko and Haye reportedly earned $32 million each for the fight.

After winning the WBA title, all of the major heavyweight titles were in the hands of the Klitschko family. Wladimir and Vitali became the first and only pair of brothers to hold all of the heavyweight titles simultaneously.

===Klitschko vs. Mormeck, Thompson II, Wach===
On 6 October 2011, Klitschko announced his next fight. It was originally to be on 10 December 2011 against the former two time unified cruiserweight world champion, Jean-Marc Mormeck (36–4, 22 KOs). The fight would have taken place at Esprit Arena, Düsseldorf. This was Wladimir&#x27;s first title defence after his win over David Haye unified all major heavyweight belts in the hands of the Klitschko brothers. The fight was predicted to generate 500 million viewers worldwide, similarly to Wladimir&#x27;s fight against Haye. On 5 December 2011, the fight was cancelled because Klitschko checked into a hospital to have a kidney stone removed. After the removal operation he suffered from fever and inflammation. The fight was rescheduled for 3 March 2012, with Klitschko dominating and knocking out Mormeck in the fourth round. CompuBox showed that in the 10 minutes and 12 seconds the fight lased, Klitschko landed 39 of 135 punches thrown (29%) and Mormeck landed just 3 of 19 thrown (16%). Mormeck failed to land anything in rounds 1 and 4.

On 4 March 2012, Klitschko stated that he would next fight his mandatory challenger Tony Thompson (36–2, 24 KOs), who had been ranked as the world&#x27;s eighth best heavyweight by BoxRec at the conclusion of the previous year, in a rematch from their first fight in 2008. At the time, he stated that the newly opened Barclays Arena in New York were interested in showcasing a Klitschko brother. Since they last fought, Thompson recorded five straight wins, all by KO. A purse bid was set by the IBF, where Klitschko, upon request, would receive 85% of the purse split, compared to the usual 75%. The fight was confirmed to take place at the Stade de Suisse in Berne, Switzerland on 7 July. In an interview, Klitschko admitted that Thompson was not his first choice and that he would have rather fought someone he had not fought before. &quot;So far I&#x27;ve always been better in rematches. However, I must not take this lightly as Thompson knows me better than any other fighter&quot;, Klitschko said in the build-up to the fight. &quot;I&#x27;ve been waiting for this rematch for so long&quot;, Thompson said during one of pre-fight press-conferences, &quot;In Bern, I&#x27;m gonna finish what I&#x27;ve started 4 years ago - knock Klitschko out and take the belts back to the United States&quot;. Thompson weighed in at 244.75, dropping 10.75 lbs from his last fight, while Klitschko weighed in at 249, the heaviest in his entire career. The additional weight appeared to be muscle.

In the first round, both fighters were cautious, patiently studying each other. Klitschko became more dominant in the second, working mostly with his jab. Thompson unsuccessfully went for the attack and in the process fell to the canvas. The referee did not rule it a knockdown. In the third round, Thompson hurt Klitschko for the first time in the fight with a counter left hand but was still being outboxed by Klitschko. In the fifth round, Klitschko pressed Thompson into a corner and hurt him with a straight right hand, knocking him down. Thompson beat the count but looked hurt, however he was able to survive that round. Klitschko continued his assault in the sixth, sending Thompson down again with a flurry of shots. Thompson got up but had to hold on to the ropes to stand, which prompted the referee to stop the fight, declaring Klitschko the winner by sixth-round TKO. &quot;From the beginning, I had no doubt that I would successfully defend the titles. But it was hard to time an accurate shot. Thompson was elusive, he didn&#x27;t lose an eye contact at any moment in the fight and was able to see most of my punches&quot;, said Klitschko in a post-fight interview. It was his twelfth consecutive title defence, the third-most in heavyweight history. CompuBox stats showed Klitschko landed 51 of 121 total punches thrown (42%) and Thompson landed only 25 of 183 thrown (14%).

Shortly afterwards, Klitschko signed a new 5–fight deal with RTL. According to the agreement, for each fight Klitschko was guaranteed €3 million for broadcasting rights and €117,000 for each of the 23 ads shown by the network throughout the fight, or approximately €2.7 million total.

There was first mention of a potential Klitschko vs. Mariusz Wach (27–0, 15 KOs) fight in August 2011 when Klitschko&#x27;s team approached Wach&#x27;s promoters for a fight, however nothing materialised. Wach&#x27;s promoter Global Boxing stated that it was Klitschko&#x27;s advisor Shelly Finkel that contacted them. Bernd Boente denied these claims. In August 2012, serious negotiations took place for the fight. A date in November was considered with the venue likely to be in Hamburg, Germany. Terms were fully agreed within days of the negotiations for the fight to take place 10 November. Klitschko revealed he would train with Johnathon Banks due to Steward recovering from a bowel operation. On 25 October, Steward died at the age of 68. The fight was the first time in his 16-year professional career that he had faced an opponent taller than himself. At 2.02 metres tall, with a reach of 2.08 metres and weighing 251 pounds, Wach was four centimetres taller than Klitschko with a reach two centimetres longer. In Poland, the fight was available via pay-per-view platform on Canal+ Sport for 39 zł and Polsat Sport for 40 zł.

On fight night, at the 02 World Arena, Klitschko dominated and retained his titles with a one sided UD. The three judges&#x27; scored the fight 120–107, 120–107, and 119–109. The bout opened with a battle between jabs which was won by Klitschko, who was following his jabs with his signature straight right. Wach managed to wobble Klitschko in round five but failed to take advantage. Wach also showed a great chin later in the fight when Klitschko began to let his hands go more landing thunderous shots. During the course of twelve rounds, Klitschko landed 274 of 693 punches landed (40%), whilst Wach landed 60 of his 308 thrown (19%). After the fight, there were allegations against Wach that he had used steroids.

Days before the Klitschko vs. Wach fight took place, it was revealed that Team Sauerland offered Klitschko €5 million (around $6,5 million) for a possible fight against then-WBO cruiserweight champion Marco Huck in the future. At the time, Huck was preparing for a title defence against Firat Arslan. Klitschko&#x27;s manager Bernd Boente turned down the offer stating money was not the issue. The reason the fight would never get made was due to the fact that the Klitschko&#x27;s had a contract with German television network RTL and Huck was signed with their rival network ARD.

===Klitschko vs. Pianeta, Povetkin, Leapai===
At the end of 2012, the WBA ordered Klitschko to fight WBA (Regular) champion Alexander Povetkin of Russia by 24 February 2013, but the two sides couldn&#x27;t reach an agreement. The WBA let Klitschko have another voluntary title defence before taking on Povetkin, but there should have been a signed contract with Povetkin before 28 February, with a new deadline for their bout no later than 31 July.

On 5 March 2013, K2 Promotions announced that Klitschko would fight another undefeated contender, Italian Francesco Pianeta, on 4 May at SAP Arena in Mannheim, Germany. Klitschko had received criticism in regards to past opponents. Pianeta was no different. Speaking to ESPN, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m getting always criticised with my opponents, it doesn&#x27;t matter are they well known or not so much and it&#x27;s always very difficult to fight against someone that is not known because you are always getting these critics.&quot; Pianeta said it was the biggest experience of his life, but not his biggest fight. He went on to say he won his biggest fight against cancer in 2009. From the start, Klitschko systematically broke down the Italian, consistently landing flush straight right hand shots. He dropped Pianeta with a right hand in round four, a left hand put Pianeta down in the fifth; the fight ended at 2:52 in round six when Klitschko put Pianeta down for the third time. According to CompuBox Stats, Klitschko landed 116 of 277 punches thrown (42%) and Pianeta landed 24 of 104 thrown (23%), an average of 4 punches landed per round.

Promoter Vladimir Hryunov won the right to promote Klitschko vs. Povetkin with a purse bid of $23,333,330 and Russian businessman Andrey Ryabinsky putting up the money. Failed bids made were from K2 Promotions ($7,130,000) and Povetkin&#x27;s promoter Sauerland Event&#x27;s ($6,014,444). It allowed Ryabinsky to dictate the location of the fight and guaranteed the fighters the biggest purses of their careers. Based on being entitled to 75 per cent of the winning bid, Klitschko got $17,499,997, while Povetkin received $5,833,333. The Klitschko camp were said to be surprised by the bid. The fight was expected to generate around 100 million viewers in Europe. It was reported that the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, was going to attend the fight.

The fight took place on 5 October 2013 at the Olympic Stadium in Moscow. The bout was marred with over 160 clinches, most initiated by Klitschko, followed by several repeated roughhouse tactics throughout the match. This included Klitschko&#x27;s leaning on his opponent and pushing his head down and throwing Povetkin away to prevent Povetkin from clinching, which resulted in the referee scoring some of Povetkin&#x27;s fallings as knockdowns, as well as Povetkin&#x27;s punching after the referee&#x27;s break command and leaning his head too low. Klitschko won by UD, scoring a knockdown in round two from a quick left hook, and three knockdowns in round seven, including one prompted from a straight right hand. All three judges scored it 119–104 on the scorecards. Klitschko landed 139 of 417 punches (33%) and Povetkin connected on 59 of 283 (21%). After the fight, Klitschko told in the interview that he had little desire to go for the knockout as the Russian crowd would be disappointed, which lead to speculations about the alleged agreement between the champion and organisers to let the bout go the distance, which Klitschko later denied. With 9.2 rating, the fight became the most popular sporting event on Russian television in 2013, as well as the most watched TV programme of the year in Moscow with 13.9 rating, surpassing the Moscow Victory Day Parade. Overall, the fight was watched by 23 million people in Russia. The fight also became the most popular TV programme of the Ukrainian television in 2013 with 19.5 rating (audience 18+) and 23 million total viewers and the most watched programme of RTL Television in 2013, averaging 11 million viewers.

In November 2013, Alex Leapai (30–4–3, 24 KOs) caused a huge upset in defeating then-unbeaten Denis Boytsov to become the WBO mandatory challenger. On 5 January 2014 K2 Promotions announced that a deal was close to being reached for the Klitschko vs. Leapai fight to take place in Germany on 26 April. Klitschko signed the contract on 3 February. It was revealed that former world title challenger David Tua declined a &#x27;lucrative offer&#x27; to spar with Klitschko ahead of the fight. Tua told Australian newspaper &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to help anyone beat a &#x27;Samoan brother&#x27;&quot;. On fight night, Klitschko knocked Leapai down three times, and referee Eddie Cotton stopped the fight with 55 seconds remaining in the fifth round. Despite all the pre-fight trash talk done by Leapai, Klitschko told him, &quot;You have truly a lionheart. You never stopped. You were challenging, you were bold. You had great desire to become a champion. Not many of my opponents have that type of attitude, that type of heart.&quot; Klitschko landed 147 of 396 punches thrown (37%), while Leapai landed a dire 10 of his 69 (14%). The 10 punches landed were made up of 6 jabs and 4 power punches.

===Klitschko vs. Pulev, Jennings===
The IBF finally ordered Klitschko vs. Kubrat Pulev on 8 May 2014 and gave a 30-day negotiation period. Klitschko&#x27;s manager Bernd Boente stated that a potential fight with WBC champion Bermane Stiverne was their main priority, a fight which would see all of the heavyweight belts at stake. Kalle Sauerland stated that he would request to get Klitschko (62–3, 52 KOs) stripped of the IBF title if he didn&#x27;t fight Pulev. At the same time Deontay Wilder was named as Stiverne&#x27;s mandatory and the WBC stated he must fight Wilder next. With the IBF purse bid split being 75–25 in favour of the champion, Klitschko requested the split be 80–20 in his favour. The IBF accepted the request. A purse bid took place on 17 June, which was won by K2 Promotions. The winning bid was $7.25 million. Sauerland Event put in a bid for $5.29 million. As per the bid, K2 had the location set as the O2 World Arena in Hamburg, with a possible date being 6 September 2014. In August, Klitschko suffered a bicep injury, thus postponing the fight by at least two months. A new date of 15 November was set. HBO announced that they would air the fight live in the afternoon, making it the 19th Klitschko fight they would show. Two days before the fight, it was revealed only the IBF title would be at stake for Pulev, however if Klitschko loses, the remaining titles would be vacated. The fight&#x27;s worldwide audience was estimated to be 300 million viewers.

Despite making a spirited effort, Pulev suffered three knockdowns en route to being knocked out in round five by a devastating left hook. The time of stoppage was recorded as 2:11 of round five. In the post-fight interview, Pulev said, &quot;Wladimir is a really good opponent, but he was lucky. I want a rematch&quot;. Klitschko praised Pulev, calling him a tough competitor. CompuBox stats showed that Klitschko landed 38 of 89 punches thrown (43%), this included 47% of his power punches. Pulev managed to land only 25 of his 110 thrown (23%). This was made up of 10 jabs and 15 power shots landed. The fight drew 10.5 million viewers in Germany and 1.8 million viewers in Bulgaria, becoming the most watched sports event on Bulgarian TV since 2007 and the most watched programme in the history of the television channel Nova TV. The fight also averaged 620,000 viewers on HBO and peaked at 700,000 viewers.

On 20 January 2015 ESPN reported that the potential Klitschko vs. Jennings was confirmed and to take place on 25 April 2015 at Madison Square Garden. Negotiations initially started in November 2014. Klitschko&#x27;s manager, Bernd Boente finally announced the fight and said all contracts had been signed. The Barclays Center in New York City was originally chosen to stage the fight, but no reason was given for the change of venue.

It would be the fourth time Klitschko would fight at the Garden, his first time at the arena and the United States since 2008, defending his WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, IBO and &quot;The Ring&quot; heavyweight titles. He defeated Jennings by effective use of his jab and nullifying Jennings&#x27; offensive game on the inside, especially by holding Jennings, which resulted in the referee deducting a point in the tenth round for excessive holding, although Klitschko did end up winning via UD with scores of 116–111, 116–111, and 118–109. According to Compubox Stats, Klitschko landed 144 of his 545 punches thrown (26%) whilst Jennings landed 110 of 376 (29 per cent). According to Nielsen Media Research, the fight averaged 1.637 million viewers on HBO, peaking at 1.742 million viewers. With this win, Klitschko defeated 23rd boxer for the world heavyweight championship, beating a record held by Joe Louis for 66 years. Klitschko reportedly earned $12.5 million for the fight.

===Klitschko vs. Fury===

Klitschko was scheduled to take on undefeated heavyweight contender Tyson Fury, the WBO mandatory challenger, on 24 October 2015. On 25 September 2015, Klitschko postponed the fight, citing a calf injury. It was rescheduled for 28 November 2015. On the night of the fight, there was much controversy, first starting with the gloves, then there was a complaint about the ring canvas. Klitschko reportedly had his hands wrapped without a representative of Fury present, so had to do them again. Klitschko lost the fight by UD, with scores of 115–112, 115–112, and 116–111 all in favour of Fury. It was the first defeat Klitschko had suffered in over ten years and marked the end of the &#x27;Klitschko Era&#x27;, referring to the time period where both Klitschko brothers dominated the division. Klitschko and Fury showed little offence during the twelve rounds, but Fury did enough to take the decision. Klitschko landed 52 of 231 punches thrown (22.5%) and Fury landed 86 of 371 thrown (23.2%).

In the post-fight interview, an emotional Fury said, &quot;This is a dream come true. We worked so hard for this. I&#x27;ve done it. It&#x27;s hard to come to foreign countries and get decisions. It just means so much to me to come here and get the decision.&quot; He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, &quot;I&#x27;d like to say to Wladimir, you&#x27;re a great champion. And thanks very much for having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup.&quot; Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury&#x27;s constant movement and mocking. He said, &quot;Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn&#x27;t throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had.&quot; Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.

Klitschko was entitled to a rematch with Fury as part of the contract for their first fight. The rematch was eventually announced on 8 April 2016 and set to take place in Fury&#x27;s home town at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England on 9 July 2016. However, Tyson Fury announced via a YouTube video that the fight would be postponed due to an ankle sprain he had received during training. He apologised to his fans and confirmed the fight would be rescheduled for a later date. On 7 July, Fury announced via his Twitter account that the rescheduled fight would take place on 29 October at the Manchester Arena. On 23 September, Fury again postponed the fight after being declared &quot;medically unfit&quot;, before eventually vacating the WBA (Super), WBO, and IBO titles, citing problems with depression after testing positive for cocaine. The rematch with Klitschko was cancelled as a result.

===Klitschko vs. Joshua===
Days after the Fury rematch was called off, Klitschko was approached by Eddie Hearn, promoter of IBF champion Anthony Joshua, to fight on 28 November date they had set for a second defence. Terms seemed to have been agreed for a £30m fight showdown although an initial contract was yet to be signed. After Fury gave up his world titles, it was said that Klitschko wanted the WBA (Super) title up for grabs in the potential match up against Joshua and waiting for approval, which the WBA kept postponing. A reason as to why the WBA was delaying sanctioning the fight was due them having a legal settlement with Lucas Browne so he could fight for the vacant title next. Klitschko then turned his attention to fighting Browne instead on 10 December, a date his team had an arena set for in Germany. On 24 October, Klitschko suffered a minor calf injury which would rule him out until 2017. Talks between the Klitschko camp and Hearn remained active with a fight set for the first part of 2017. On 2 November, the WBA finally agreed to sanction a fight for their super title as long as Joshua defeats Eric Molina in December 2016.

On 10 December, immediately after Joshua had defeated Molina at the Manchester Arena, Klitschko was invited into the ring by Hearn. It was announced that Klitschko and Joshua would face each other for the WBA (Super), IBF and vacant IBO titles at Wembley Stadium, London, on 29 April 2017. WBA president Gilberto Jesus Mendoza confirmed that the winner will have to face mandatory challenger Luis Ortiz next, with deadlines due to be set after the unification fight. A day later the IBF announced the winner must fight their mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev. Because of this clashing with the WBA enforcing their mandatory, it was believed that either Joshua or Klitschko would have to vacate a title. In January 2017, Eddie Hearn announced that over 80,000 tickets had been sold, a new box office record, overtaking Carl Froch vs. George Groves II. He put a request in for 5,000 more tickets to be made available. At the weigh in, Klitschko weighed in at 240 and a quarter pounds, the lightest he has weighed since 2009. Joshua came in heavier at 250 pounds.

In front of a post-war record crowd of 90,000 in attendance, Joshua won by TKO in a high-drama contest that saw both men giving their all. They fought a close and cautious first four rounds. In the fifth, Joshua came out and threw a barrage of punches, forcing Klitschko to the canvas. An angry Klitschko rose up and dominated Joshua for the remainder of the round, before landing a clean right hand and scoring his own knockdown in round six. The next few rounds were again cautious, both men wary of each other, until a reinvigorated Joshua attacked Klitschko in round eleven with an upper-cut blow to the right side of Klitschko&#x27;s face which would be the beginning of the end for the Ukrainian. Joshua then put together a few small but powerful combinations which sent his opponent to the canvas. Klitschko again rose but Joshua knocked him down for a second time in the round by unleashing a seven-punch combination, flooring Klitschko with a left hook. Moments later Joshua tried to end the fight by swinging a few right hooks and managed to back Klitschko into the ropes where he again sent a barrage of punches with no reply. The referee then concluded that Klitschko had taken enough punishment and stopped the fight.

At the time of stoppage, Joshua was ahead on two judges&#x27; scorecards at 96–93 and 95–93, while the third judge had Klitschko ahead 95–93. CompuBox stats showed that Joshua landed 107 of his 355 punches thrown (30.1%), and Klitschko landed 94 of 256 (36.7%). In the post-fight interviews, Klitschko spoke about the rematch clause, but gave no indication as to whether he would activate it, &quot;Of course we have a rematch in the contract. I need to analyze and see what the heck happened. I wish I could have raised my hands, but congrats to him. He got up, he fought back, and he won the titles.&quot; In the press conference after the fight, Joshua said he would have no issues with having another fight with Klitschko, &quot;I don&#x27;t mind fighting him again, if he wants the rematch. Big respect to Wladimir for challenging the young lions of the division. It&#x27;s up to him, I don&#x27;t mind. As long as Rob thinks it&#x27;s good I&#x27;m good to go.&quot; Eddie Hearn said Joshua&#x27;s next fight would likely take place at the end of the year, possibly at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff.

The fight averaged 659,000 viewers on Showtime in the United States. It was shown live and the fight began around 5 pm. ET and 2 pm. PT. Nielsen Media Research revealed the fight peaked at 687,000 viewers which was during rounds five and six. The delayed tape-replay on HBO was watched by an average 738,000 viewers and peaked at 890,000. In a press release, German TV channel RTL announced the fight was watched by an average 10.43 million viewers. The whole card averaged 9.59 million viewers. This was higher than the 8.91 million that tuned in to watch Klitschko vs. Fury in 2015. The fight did lower numbers than Klitschko&#x27;s win over Mariusz Wach in 2012, which was watched by 11 million and Klitschko vs. Haye, which was seen by over 16 million.

On 7 June 2017, the IBF granted Joshua an exception for him to rematch Klitschko instead of fighting mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev. At this point, it was not said that the rematch would take place. Klitschko said he needed time to review his situation before agreeing to a rematch. It was only weeks after the fight, when Eddie Hearn filed the paperwork to the IBF to request the exception to the mandatory defence. The IBF explained that the rematch must take place no later than 2 December 2017 and the winner must fight Pulev next with no exceptions.

On 11 July 2017, Eddie Hearn travelled to the US to apply for a Nevada boxing licence for promoting and to also scout potential locations in Las Vegas speaking to MGM. He had a tour of the T-Mobile Arena. Although Nigeria, Dubai and China were discussed, Hearn warmed up to the idea of the fight taking place in Las Vegas. Hearn told Sky Sports, &quot;We met with Richard Sturm and the team at MGM in Las Vegas yesterday and had a full tour of the T-Mobile Arena which is very impressive. There is a huge appetite from both sides to hold the rematch there and we will be talking further over the next week or so to see if that can become a reality.&quot; Showtime&#x27;s Stephen Espinoza said a deal could be reached quickly, as he was also eager to get Joshua, who was in contract with Showtime, to fight in US, &quot;It&#x27;s no secret we&#x27;ve been salivating about getting him over here and certainly that would be a phenomenal fight. It would be the biggest heavyweight Vegas fight in probably a couple of decades, so we would love to host it.&quot; On 25 July, Hearn pencilled on 11 November 2017 for the rematch to take place at the T-Mobile Arena. It was reported the fight could be pay-per-view in the US.

===Retirement===
On 3 August 2017, Klitschko announced on his official website and social media channels that he was retiring from boxing. He ended his professional career with 64 wins in 69 fights, 53 by knockout. He competed in 29 world title fights.

==Legacy==

During Klitschko&#x27;s reign as world heavyweight champion, his fights would reportedly draw up to 500 million viewers worldwide. Klitschko has been named multiple times among the 100 highest paid athletes in the world by Forbes: he was ranked 24th in 2012 (estimated earnings $28 million between June 2011 and June 2012), 41st in 2013 ($24 million), 25th in 2014 ($28 million), 63rd in 2015 ($22.5 million) and 98th in 2017 ($21.5 million). Klitschko was unranked by Forbes in 2016, despite the fact that he reportedly earned $22.5 million for the fight against Tyson Fury in November 2015 alone (100th-ranked Buster Posey earned $20.8 million; 85th-ranked Conor McGregor earned $22 million). Wladimir Klitschko&#x27;s total professional career earnings&#x27; estimations vary between €150 million and $250 million. Known for charity work and philanthropy, Wladimir is one of only 15 current or former alive athletes that have been named UNESCO Champions for Sport.

Considered national heroes in Ukraine, in 2008 the Klitschko brothers were ranked number 15 in Inter&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Ukrainians&quot; following a nation-wide poll that saw around 2.5 million people casting their votes. Boxing fights involving one of the Klitschko brothers regularly attracted between 10 and 20 million viewers in Ukraine; Wladimir&#x27;s fight against Alexander Povetkin generated even bigger viewership numbers, attracting 23 million viewers. Wladimir has been named multiple times among the 100 most influential people in Ukraine by Korrespondent: he was ranked 95th in 2006, 88th in 2010, 43rd in 2011, 51st in 2012 and 45th in 2013. Forbes named Klitschko the most popular celebrity in Ukraine in 2015, placing him ahead of a singer Svyatoslav Vakarchuk and Kvartal 95 Studio, and ranked him second and third in 2012 and 2013 respectively (the ranking wasn&#x27;t conducted in 2014). In 2017, Wladimir was honoured with the Order of Liberty, the highest Ukrainian honour that can be awarded to a person of any nationality, for his achievements in sports and contribution to the economical, scientific and cultural development of Ukraine.

The Klitschkos were also considered big stars in Germany. A survey carried out by TNS for the Horizont Sport Business in 2003 showed that 91.7% of Germans recognized Wladimir Klitschko while 70.5% celebrated his successes, making him the fourth most recognized and third most beloved athlete in Germany at the time. According to DW, another research conducted no later than 2011 showed that nearly 99% of people in Germany recognized the Klitschko brothers. The CPI Index conducted by the agency Celebrity Performance in 2012 had the Klitschkos ranked second on the list of the most marketable celebrities in Germany, while in January 2014, based on a survey of 1151 respondents that was conducted by the same agency, the Klitschko brothers were ranked 6th in the &quot;2013 Person of the Year&quot; category. Twelve of his fights generated above 10 million average viewers, and his world heavyweight title defence against Eddie Chambers in March 2010 drew bigger viewership numbers on RTL than the return of the Formula One legend voted the greatest German athlete of the 20th century Michael Schumacher.

Credited for selling out sports stadiums, Klitschko had eight of his fights take place at sports stadiums in Germany, Switzerland and United Kingdom, with all but one having attendances ranging from 43,000 to 90,000.

During his career, Wladimir defeated 23 boxers for the world heavyweight championship, the most in boxing history. Klitschko holds several historical records, including the longest combined world championship reign in heavyweight history at 4,382 days (12 years); the most beaten opponents and wins in world heavyweight title bouts since the international expansion of boxing governing bodies, at 23 and 25 respectively; the most wins in unified title bouts and the longest unified championship reign in professional boxing history at 15 title bouts and 14 consecutive defences respectively. He has the second most total successful title defences of any heavyweight boxer with 23 (including his first reign as WBO champion), behind Joe Louis (25) and ahead of Larry Holmes (20) and Muhammad Ali (19) and the third most consecutive title defenses in heavyweight history. Klitschko fought in 29 world heavyweight title fights, more than any other boxer in history.

As of November 2024, BoxRec ranks Wladimir Klitschko as the 76th greatest boxer of all time, pound for pound. According to BoxRec, Klitschko has also defeated 12 previously undefeated fighters with a combined record 267–0–5 (174 KOs) – these 12 included Najee Shaheed (professional record 16–0–1, 8 KOs coming into the fight), Zoran Vujicic (14–0, 6 KOs), Eliseo Castillo (18–0–1, 14 KOs), Samuel Peter (24–0, 21 KOs), Calvin Brock (29–0, 22 KOs), Sultan Ibragimov (22–0–1, 17 KOs), Ruslan Chagaev (25–0–1, 17 KOs), Mariusz Wach (27–0, 15 KOs), Francesco Pianeta (28–0–1, 15 KOs), Alexander Povetkin (26–0, 18 KOs), Kubrat Pulev (20–0, 11 KOs) and Bryant Jennings (19–0, 10 KOs). Wladimir has beaten 9 current or former world champions throughout his career. These included heavyweight champions Chris Byrd (twice), Ray Mercer, Lamon Brewster, Samuel Peter (twice), Sultan Ibragimov, Hasim Rahman and Ruslan Chagaev, two-weight world champion David Haye and unified cruiserweight champion Jean-Marc Mormeck.

Known for his punching power, Klitschko defeated his opponent inside the distance 56 times in 69 fights, an 81% knockout-to-win ratio (this includes two DQs and one TD). Of his thirteen remaining bouts, four involved an opponent that Klitschko knocked out in a rematch (Everett Martin, Chris Byrd, Lamon Brewster, and Samuel Peter), three saw him knock his opponent down multiple times on the way to a wide decision victory (David Haye, Alexander Povetkin, and the first fight against Chris Byrd), two saw Klitschko hurt and knock down his opponent before being knocked out himself (Anthony Joshua and the first fight with Lamon Brewster), and three involved fighters who have never been knocked out by anyone before or after in all of their professional careers (Tyson Fury, Sultan Ibragimov, and Ross Puritty).

Analyzing his legacy, Dan Rafael wrote that Klitschko proved himself to be an all-time great heavyweight, and that his legacy will be viewed more favourably as time passes, comparing him to Lennox Lewis in that regard. Rafael believes that Klitschko&#x27;s 22-fight winning streak from 2004 to 2015, which included unifying three titles, cemented his legacy among the greatest of all time. Klitschko was criticized for his cautious boxing style, but Rafael argues that a lack of exciting fights is not equal to lack of quality. He also believes that the alleged weakness of the era in which Klitschko competed is overexaggerated, arguing that only two eras in heavyweight boxing, the 1970s and 1990s, could be considered great eras, and that Klitschko&#x27;s era is no weaker than that of Mike Tyson who made only half as many title defenses as Wladimir did. Despite this, Rafael insists that Wladimir still has a lot of quality opponents on his resume, such as Chris Byrd, David Haye, Alexander Povetkin, Calvin Brock, Sultan Ibragimov and Ruslan Chagaev, and that those wins should not be dismissed due to their one-sided nature; in fact, it only emphasizes the quality of Klitschko&#x27;s boxing skills and in-ring intelligence. Rafael wrote that even though Klitschko suffered some bad losses, the totality of his career must be considered.

In 2021, Klitschko was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, having been elected over Miguel Cotto and James Toney by a panel of around 200 international boxing historians.

==Other interests==
Klitschko is also a passionate golfer and was seen playing in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland. The tournament was played over three courses in 2008 including St Andrews, Carnoustie, and Kingsbarns in Fife and Angus. Klitschko was named curator of the Ukrainian pavilion at the 2009 Venice Biennale.

As of October 2015, Klitschko was an adjunct professor at Switzerland&#x27;s University of St. Gallen, where he taught master&#x27;s students.

==Personal life==
From 2009, Klitschko was in a relationship with American actress Hayden Panettiere. Panettiere has appeared ringside at some of Klitschko&#x27;s fights, including at Klitschko&#x27;s 10th-round KO victory over Samuel Peter. The couple had a brief split in 2011, but were together again in 2013. In October 2013, Panettiere confirmed that she and Klitschko were engaged. They have one child together, a daughter, born in December 2014. In August 2018, according to Panettiere&#x27;s mother, Lesley Vogel, the couple had split for a second time. They were said to be on &#x27;good terms&#x27; for the sake of their daughter.

On 6 December 2013, Klitschko and his then-fiancée Hayden Panettiere visited the Euromaidan-protests in Kyiv. His brother Vitali was one of the leading figures of these protests. He and Panettiere addressed the crowds.

Wladimir and his brother Vitali have never fought each other in a professional fight as their mother made them promise to never fight each other.

Klitschko speaks four languages: English, German, Russian, and Ukrainian. He was friends with the late German heavyweight legend Max Schmeling.

On 29 March 2012, during a charitable auction in Kyiv, Ukraine, Klitschko auctioned off his 1996 Olympic gold medal to a buyer who bid $1 million. Klitschko said he would use the money to help the dreams of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children. After the sale, the buyer immediately returned the medal out of respect for Klitschko and because he wanted it to remain with the Klitschko family.

In February 2022, Klitschko joined the Kyiv Territorial Defense Brigade (a military reserve component of the Ukrainian Armed Forces). Both he and his brother Vitali Klitschko, who has been Mayor of Kyiv since 2014, pledged to fight to protect the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv, through armed forces, in response to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine that began on 24 February 2022. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, Wladimir and Vitali were on Vladimir Putin&#x27;s personal hitlist of 24 high-profile Ukrainian figures whom he wanted assassinated.

On 10 March 2022, the brothers announced via Telegram that they had raised €100 million of financial support for Ukraine with a fundraising campaign in Germany.

In November 2024, Klitschko issued a request to American podcast host Joe Rogan to have him on his show in order to discuss their differences regarding the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Klitschko accused Rogan of &quot;repeating Russian propaganda.&quot;

<text>The jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi; or ) is a wild cat native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to northern Mexico, through Central and South America east of the Andes. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build. Its coloration is uniform with two color morphs, gray and red. It has an elongated body, with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short snout, and a long tail, resembling mustelids in these respects. It is about twice as large as a domestic cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), reaching nearly at the shoulder, and weighs .

Secretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are more gregarious. Unlike other sympatric cats such as the ocelot, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large home ranges, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, rodents and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a gestation period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born. Lifespans of up to 15 years have been recorded in captivity.

The jaguarundi inhabits a broad array of both closed and open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and deciduous forests to deserts and thorn scrubs. It is fairly common in Brazil, Peru, and Venezuela, but may be extirpated from the United States. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List, but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and fragmentation of habitat, as well as persecution for killing poultry.

==Etymology==
The common name &quot;jaguarundi&quot; comes from the Old Guarani word , similar to the Old Tupi word , meaning &quot;dark jaguar&quot;. The name is pronounced or . In some Spanish-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called , , , and . It is also called , , , and in Brazilian Portuguese.

==Taxonomy==
In 1803 Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire described two jaguarundi skins and skulls from unknown locations in Central America and proposed the scientific name &quot;Felis yagouarundi&quot;. In the 19th and 20th centuries, several more zoological specimens were described:
*&quot;Felis eyra&quot; proposed by Gotthelf Fischer von Waldheim in 1814 was a ferruginous skin from Paraguay.
*&quot;F. cacomitli&quot; proposed by Jean-Louis Berlandier in 1859 was a skull and a grayish skin of a female jaguarundi from the Rio Grande area in Mexico.
*&quot;F. yagouaroundi tolteca&quot; proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1898 was a skull and a reddish skin from Sinaloa in Mexico.
*&quot;F. Ameghinoi&quot; proposed by Eduardo Ladislao Holmberg in 1898 for fossil cat bones, presumably of a jaguarundi, that were excavated near San Luis, Argentina.
*&quot;F. fossata&quot; by Edgar Alexander Mearns in 1901 was a large jaguarundi skull from Yucatán.
*&quot;F. panamensis&quot; by Joel Asaph Allen in 1904 was a dusky gray skin of a young adult female jaguarundi collected in Panama&#x27;s Chiriquí Province.
*&quot;F. yagouaroundi melantho&quot; by Oldfield Thomas in 1914 were skulls and blackish brown skins of a male and a female from Pozuzo District in Peru.

The generic name &quot;Herpailurus&quot; was proposed by Nikolai Severtzov in 1858 for the jaguarundi. Later authors classified the jaguarundi in the genus &quot;Puma&quot; along with the cougar (&quot;P. concolor&quot;). Phylogeographical analysis of jaguarundi samples from across its range found no genetic evidence for subspecies. In 2017, the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and recognises the jaguarundi as a monotypic taxon of the genus &quot;Herpailurus&quot;.

===Phylogeny and evolution===
The jaguarundi is most closely related to the cougar; the jaguarundi-cougar clade is sister to the cheetah. These three species comprise the &quot;Puma&quot; lineage, one of the eight lineages of Felidae; the &quot;Puma&quot; lineage diverged from the rest . The sister group of the &quot;Puma&quot; lineage is a clade of smaller Old World cats that includes the genera &quot;Felis&quot;, &quot;Otocolobus&quot; and &quot;Prionailurus&quot;.

The three species of the &quot;Puma&quot; lineage may have had a common ancestor during the Miocene, about . &quot;Acinonyx&quot; possibly diverged from the lineage in the Americas; some authors alternatively suggest that the cheetah diverged in the Old World.

The &quot;Puma&quot; lineage appears to have migrated from Asia to North America after crossing the Bering Strait, arriving in South America via the Isthmus of Panama by the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene. This was possibly followed by the bifurcation of the lineage into the cougar and &quot;Herpailurus&quot; (represented by &quot;H. pumoides&quot;) in South America around between the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene. &quot;H. pumoides&quot; went extinct around Middle Pleistocene, around the time the modern jaguarundi came into existence; the oldest fossils of the modern jaguarundi date back to the Late Pleistocene in Brazil around . The original North American cougars were extirpated during the Pleistocene extinctions around 10,000 years ago; North America was then recolonized by South American cougars and jaguarundis 10,000–8,000 years ago. The extinct North American genus &quot;Miracinonyx&quot; is another member of this clade.

==Characteristics==

The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other neotropical cats—such as the small, spotted cats in the genus &quot;Leopardus&quot;—in its external appearance. This has been attributed to variations in its karyotype—the jaguarundi has 38 chromosomes, unlike the 36 in other small South American cats, and the chromosomal features resemble those of Old World cats such as the leopard cat (&quot;Prionailurus bengalensis&quot;). In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in mustelids such as otters and weasels—it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short snout and a long tail. The head-and-body length is between ; the strong, muscular tail is long. Around twice as large as the domestic cat, the jaguarundi reaches nearly at the shoulder and weighs , though larger individuals weighing around have been reported. Males are slightly larger than females.

The coat is uniformly colored with at most a few faint markings on the face and the belly, though kittens are spotted for a short duration. Black and white marks on the lips and the snout, similar to those of the cougar, can be clearly seen in juveniles and some adults. Two color morphs are known (though intermediate shades are also seen)—gray (blackish to brownish-gray fur with a grizzled look due to bright and dark rings on individual hairs) and red (foxy red to chestnut); earlier these morphs were considered two different species. Individuals of both colors can be born in the same litter. Blackish brown individuals superficially resemble the tayra (&quot;Eira barbara&quot;), but the latter can be told apart by the clear, yellowish patch on the throat. The red morph is seen more often in dry, open areas. Melanistic individuals have been reported, but the coat is not completely black; the head and the throat are clearly paler than the rest of the body. The widely spaced ears are long without any spots on the back. The jaguarundi has a total of 30 teeth; the dental formula is .

Among felids, the jaguarundi is closely similar to the flat-headed cat (&quot;Prionailurus planiceps&quot;), but has a longer body and proportionately longer legs, is heavier and lacks the dark markings on the cheeks of the flat-headed cat. Tawny jaguarundis bear a similar coloration to the larger cougar.

The diploid number of chromosomes in jaguarundi is 2n=38.

==Distribution and habitat==
The jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats, from tropical rainforests and deciduous forests to deserts and thorn scrubs. It can also be found in cloud forests, mangroves and savannas. Unlike the sympatric margay, ocelot and oncilla, the jaguarundi can live in open areas as well. In open habitats the jaguarundi prefers areas with vegetative cover such as cacti, which would generally be difficult for potential predators to penetrate; there may be a few clearings at the periphery of such areas. Jaguarundis tend to stay close to a source of running water. The jaguarundi is noted for its resistance to environmental disturbances in its habitat; it can thrive in reforested areas. While commonly inhabiting elevations from lowlands up to above sea level, this cat has been reported at altitudes as high as in Colombia.

The range extends from central Argentina in the south to northern Mexico, through Central and South America east of the Andes—second only to the cougar in the latitudinal extent of its distribution. However, not all parts of its range have been studied well. The jaguarundi is fairly common in Brazil, Peru, and Venezuela. It is possibly extirpated in the United States; a 1999 study refuted claims of sightings in Arizona, in the Huachuca Mountains in Santa Cruz County. The last confirmed sighting in the U.S. was of a roadkilled individual near Brownsville, Texas, in 1986.
Jaguarundis have been sighted in Florida since the early 20th century. Their presence there is attributed to a writer from Chiefland who at some point imported the animals from their native habitat and released them near his hometown and in other locations across the state. While no physical evidence is known, numerous credible sightings have been reported beginning in 1907. In 1977, W. T. Neill noted that reliable sightings had decreased and concluded that the population had declined. Jaguarundis have also been reported in the coastal area of Alabama since the 1980s, which may be evidence of the Florida population migrating northward. The jaguarundi has also been recorded in Cerro Largo in Uruguay, where its presence was doubted.

==Behavior and ecology==

The jaguarundi is shy and reclusive, and apparently very cautious of traps. There have been only a few radio telemetry studies of jaguarundis in Belize, Brazil and Mexico. Though activity has been observed throughout the day and at night, jaguarundis seem to prefer hunting during daytime and evening hours; for instance, a study in Belize reported that jaguarundis started moving before dawn and remained active through most of the day till sunset with a peak in hunting from late morning to noon. The cat appears to be more diurnal than most other cats, especially spotted cats that tend to be more active at night. The jaguarundi can swim across medium-sized rivers; one in Bolivia was recorded swimming across the Tuichi River. Jaguarundis are efficient climbers as well, but hunt mainly on ground; the coat color works as a good camouflage for terrestrial activity. They can leap up to into the air to catch birds. Predators recorded for jaguarundis include boa constrictors, cougars and domestic dogs. Parasites such as hookworms (&quot;Ancylostoma&quot; species), tapeworms (such as &quot;Spirometra&quot; and &quot;Toxocara&quot; species) and the lung fluke have been found in jaguarundis.

Studies have mostly observed jaguarundis alone or in pairs; pairs could probably be formed between mothers and older kittens or between individuals of opposite sexes during the mating season. Individuals in captivity have been found to be more gregarious. Home ranges tend to be large; a study in Brazil recorded home ranges in size for females, while those of males measured in area. Two males in Belize were recorded to have exceptionally large home ranges spanning an area of and , while the home range of a female in the same region measured in size. Population densities are typically low, around in Brazil, though Tamaulipas (Mexico) and the Llanos in Costa Rica and Venezuela have recorded figures as high as .

Marking behavior could serve as a means of olfactory or visual communication among jaguarundis; individuals in captivity have been observed scraping areas with their hind feet (sometimes with urination), clawing on logs, rubbing objects with their heads and leaving feces uncovered. Social behavior such as grooming, growling and sniffing has been recorded. The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a &#x27;wah-wah&#x27; call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp. In captivity, females in estrus have been observed making faint sounds as they scent mark the area around their enclosures.

===Diet===

The jaguarundi typically feeds on small-sized prey weighing less than , including ground-feeding birds, reptiles, frogs, arthropods, rodents and small mammals. Jaguarundis will also take larger prey such as domestic poultry, fish, marmosets, rabbits and opossums; a study recorded small deer (possibly carrion) in the diet. Vegetation such as grasses have also been recorded in their diet. A study showed jaguarundis take of vertebrate prey on an average every day. The jaguarundi seems to have a strong preference for mammals, as evidenced by an analysis of 14 papers, where it was found that nearly two thirds of its diet comprised small mammals. In particular, rodents of the genus &quot;Oryzomys&quot;, &quot;Sigmodon&quot; and &quot;Zygodontomys&quot; were found to be the most targeted prey items in several range countries. These rodents made up the bulk of the jaguarundi&#x27;s diet in Venezuela, the Atlantic forests, the Cockscomb Basin and the southern Pacific dry forests. The second most targeted mammalian prey were mice belonging to the genera &quot;Reithrodontomys&quot;, &quot;Peromyscus&quot; and &quot;Liomys&quot;. On rare occasions, jaguarundis have been recorded consuming larger mammals such as the common opossum and common tapeti. The broad array of prey recorded for the jaguarundi across its range and varying proportions of different prey in its diet could indicate that the cat tends to feed on the most abundant and easily catchable prey in the area.

===Reproduction===
Jaguarundis have been observed mating all year round, with peaks at different times of the year across the range; for instance, in Mexico breeding peaks in January and March. Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and spraying urine. Sexually mature males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female&#x27;s neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.

After a gestation period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older. The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, but they simply play with it until the mother ultimately ingests it. Kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.

==Threats and conservation==

The jaguarundi has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2002. Mexican populations, except those in the northeast, appear to be stable. The huge protected areas in the Amazon Basin are probably the only conservation units that can sustain long-term viable populations. IUCN Red List assessors noted that it should be listed as Near Threatened, but the data were not sufficient to extend this classification throughout the jaguarundi&#x27;s range. The jaguarundi is not particularly sought after for its fur due to its poor quality and low value, but it is suffering decline due to habitat loss.

Other threats include risks of habitat fragmentation and persecution for killing poultry. The North and Central American jaguarundi populations are listed in CITES Appendix I and all the other populations are listed in CITES Appendix II. Populations in the US are protected under the Endangered Species Act; the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has expressed concern that its presence in South Texas may be imperiled due to loss of the cat&#x27;s native habitat. Populations in Mexico are listed under the Mexican Official Norm NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010.

Hunting jaguarundi is restricted in Peru and banned in Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Uruguay, United States, and Venezuela.
