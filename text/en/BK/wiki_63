<text>In electronics, pin-compatible devices are electronic components, generally integrated circuits or expansion cards, sharing a common footprint and with the same functions assigned or usable on the same pins. Pin compatibility is a property desired by systems integrators as it allows a product to be updated without redesigning printed circuit boards, which can reduce costs and decrease time to market.

Although devices which are pin-compatible share a common footprint, they are not necessarily electrically or thermally compatible. As a result, manufacturers often specify devices as being either &quot;pin-to-pin&quot; or &quot;drop-in&quot; compatible. Pin-compatible devices are generally produced to allow upgrading within a single product line, to allow end-of-life devices to be replaced with newer equivalents, or to compete with the equivalent products of other manufacturers.

== Pin-to-pin compatibility ==

&quot;Pin-to-pin compatible&quot; devices share an assignment of functions to pins, but may have differing electrical characteristics (supply voltages, or oscillator frequencies) or thermal characteristics (TDPs, reflow curves, or temperature tolerances). As a result, their use in a system may require that portions of the system, such as its power delivery subsystem, be adapted to fit the new component.

A common example of pin-to-pin compatible devices which may not be electrically compatible are the 7400 series integrated circuits. The 7400 series devices have been produced on a number of different manufacturing processes, but have retained the same pinouts throughout. For example, all 7405 devices provide six NOT gates (or inverters) but may have incompatible supply voltage tolerances.

* 7405 – Standard TTL, 4.75–5.25 V.
* 74C05 – CMOS, 4–15 V.
* 74LV05 – Low-voltage CMOS, 2.0–5.5 V.

In other cases, particularly with computers, devices may be pin-to-pin compatible but made otherwise incompatible as a result of market segmentation. For example, Intel Skylake desktop-class Core and Xeon E3v5 processors both use the LGA 1151 socket, but motherboards using C230-series chipsets will only be compatible with Xeon-branded processors, and will not work with Core-branded processors.

== Drop-in compatibility ==

A &quot;drop-in compatible&quot; device is a device which may be swapped with another without need to make compensating alterations to the system the device was a part of. The device will have the same functions available on the same pins, and will be electrically and thermally compatible. Such devices may not be an exact match to the devices they can replace. For example, they may have a wider range of supply voltage or temperature tolerances.

== Software compatibility ==
&quot;Software-compatible&quot; devices are devices which are able to run the same software to produce the same results without the software having to be modified first.

Microcontrollers, FPGAs, and other programmable devices may be pin-to-pin compatible from the perspective of the program on the device, but incompatible in terms of hardware. For example, the device may take the signal on pin X, negate it, and output the result on pin Y. If the method of configuring a pin remains the same but the package of the device (such as TSSOP or QFN) changes, the program will continue to function but the physical locations of the pins the program works with may change.

A device may also be pin-compatible while being software-incompatible. This may occur when the device uses a different instruction set, or if the device has a multiplexer attached to a pin (which, for example, may allow the switching of the pin between being driven as GPIO or by an A/D) and that multiplexer selects, by default, a different input source than is selected on the device being replaced.

To ease the use of software-incompatible devices, manufacturers often provide hardware abstraction layers. Examples of these include, CMSIS for ARM Cortex-M processors and the now-deprecated HAL subsystem for UNIX-like operating systems.

<doc id="385510" wikidata="Q2498782" url="?curid=385510" title="Finsler manifold">
<text>In mathematics, particularly differential geometry, a Finsler manifold is a differentiable manifold where a (possibly asymmetric) [[Minkowski functional|Minkowski norm]] is provided on each tangent space , that enables one to define the length of any smooth curve as

:formula_1

Finsler manifolds are more general than Riemannian manifolds since the tangent norms need not be induced by inner products.

Every Finsler manifold becomes an intrinsic quasimetric space when the distance between two points is defined as the infimum length of the curves that join them.

 named Finsler manifolds after Paul Finsler, who studied this geometry in his dissertation .

==Definition==
A Finsler manifold is a differentiable manifold together with a Finsler metric, which is a continuous nonnegative function defined on the tangent bundle so that for each point of ,

* for every two vectors tangent to at (subadditivity).
* for all (but not necessarily for  (positive homogeneity).
* unless (positive definiteness).

In other words, is an asymmetric norm on each tangent space . The Finsler metric is also required to be smooth, more precisely:

* is smooth on the complement of the zero section of .

The subadditivity axiom may then be replaced by the following strong convexity condition:

* For each tangent vector , the Hessian matrix of at is positive definite.

Here the Hessian of at is the symmetric bilinear form

:formula_2

also known as the fundamental tensor of at . Strong convexity of implies the subadditivity with a strict inequality if . If is strongly convex, then it is a Minkowski norm on each tangent space.

A Finsler metric is reversible if, in addition,

* for all tangent vectors &quot;v&quot;.

A reversible Finsler metric defines a norm (in the usual sense) on each tangent space.

==Examples==
* Smooth submanifolds (including open subsets) of a normed vector space of finite dimension are Finsler manifolds if the norm of the vector space is smooth outside the origin.
* Riemannian manifolds (but not pseudo-Riemannian manifolds) are special cases of Finsler manifolds.

===Randers manifolds===
Let formula_3 be a Riemannian manifold and &quot;b&quot; a differential one-form on &quot;M&quot; with
:formula_4

where formula_5 is the inverse matrix of formula_6 and the Einstein notation is used. Then
:formula_7

defines a Randers metric on &quot;M&quot; and formula_8 is a Randers manifold, a special case of a non-reversible Finsler manifold.

===Smooth quasimetric spaces===
Let (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) be a quasimetric so that &quot;M&quot; is also a differentiable manifold and &quot;d&quot; is compatible with the differential structure of &quot;M&quot; in the following sense:
* Around any point &quot;z&quot; on &quot;M&quot; there exists a smooth chart (&quot;U&quot;, φ) of &quot;M&quot; and a constant &quot;C&quot; ≥ 1 such that for every &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot;
*: formula_9
* The function &quot;d&quot;: &quot;M&quot; × &quot;M&quot; → [0, ∞] is smooth in some punctured neighborhood of the diagonal.

Then one can define a Finsler function &quot;F&quot;: &quot;TM&quot; →[0, ∞] by

:formula_10

where &quot;γ&quot; is any curve in &quot;M&quot; with &quot;γ&quot;(0) = &quot;x&quot; and &quot;γ&quot;&#x27;(0) = v. The Finsler function &quot;F&quot; obtained in this way restricts to an asymmetric (typically non-Minkowski) norm on each tangent space of &quot;M&quot;. The induced intrinsic metric of the original quasimetric can be recovered from

:formula_11

and in fact any Finsler function &quot;F&quot;: T&quot;M&quot; → [0, ∞) defines an intrinsic quasimetric &quot;d&quot;&quot;L&quot; on &quot;M&quot; by this formula.

==Geodesics==
Due to the homogeneity of &quot;F&quot; the length

:formula_12

of a differentiable curve &quot;γ&quot;: [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] → &quot;M&quot; in &quot;M&quot; is invariant under positively oriented reparametrizations. A constant speed curve &quot;γ&quot; is a geodesic of a Finsler manifold if its short enough segments &quot;γ&quot;|[&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;] are length-minimizing in &quot;M&quot; from &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) to &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;d&quot;). Equivalently, &quot;γ&quot; is a geodesic if it is stationary for the energy functional

:formula_13

in the sense that its functional derivative vanishes among differentiable curves with fixed endpoints and .

===Canonical spray structure on a Finsler manifold===
The Euler–Lagrange equation for the energy functional &quot;E&quot;[&quot;γ&quot;] reads in the local coordinates (&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;n, &quot;v&quot;1, ..., &quot;v&quot;n) of T&quot;M&quot; as

:formula_14

where &quot;k&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;n&quot; and &quot;g&quot;ij is the coordinate representation of the fundamental tensor, defined as

:formula_15

Assuming the strong convexity of &quot;F&quot;2(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) with respect to &quot;v&quot; ∈ T&quot;x&quot;&quot;M&quot;, the matrix &quot;g&quot;&quot;ij&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) is invertible and its inverse is denoted by &quot;g&quot;&quot;ij&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;v&quot;). Then is a geodesic of (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) if and only if its tangent curve is an integral curve of the smooth vector field &quot;H&quot; on T&quot;M&quot;&amp;setminus;{0} locally defined by

:formula_16

where the local spray coefficients &quot;G&quot;i are given by

:formula_17

The vector field &quot;H&quot; on T&quot;M&quot;&amp;setminus;{0} satisfies &quot;JH&quot; = &quot;V&quot; and [&quot;V&quot;, &quot;H&quot;] = &quot;H&quot;, where &quot;J&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are the canonical endomorphism and the canonical vector field on T&quot;M&quot;&amp;setminus;{0}. Hence, by definition, &quot;H&quot; is a spray on &quot;M&quot;. The spray &quot;H&quot; defines a nonlinear connection on the fibre bundle through the vertical projection

:formula_18

In analogy with the Riemannian case, there is a version

:formula_19

of the Jacobi equation for a general spray structure (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;H&quot;) in terms of the Ehresmann curvature and nonlinear covariant derivative.

===Uniqueness and minimizing properties of geodesics===
By Hopf–Rinow theorem there always exist length minimizing curves (at least in small enough neighborhoods) on (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;F&quot;). Length minimizing curves can always be positively reparametrized to be geodesics, and any geodesic must satisfy the Euler–Lagrange equation for &quot;E&quot;[&quot;γ&quot;]. Assuming the strong convexity of &quot;F&quot;2 there exists a unique maximal geodesic &quot;γ&quot; with &quot;γ&quot;(0) = x and &quot;γ&quot;&#x27;(0) = v for any (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) ∈ T&quot;M&quot;&amp;setminus;{0} by the uniqueness of integral curves.

If &quot;F&quot;2 is strongly convex, geodesics &quot;γ&quot;: [0, &quot;b&quot;] → &quot;M&quot; are length-minimizing among nearby curves until the first point &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) conjugate to &quot;γ&quot;(0) along &quot;γ&quot;, and for &quot;t&quot; &gt; &quot;s&quot; there always exist shorter curves from &quot;γ&quot;(0) to &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) near &quot;γ&quot;, as in the Riemannian case.

<text>Harriet Pearl Alice Cohen CBE (2 December 189513 November 1967) was a British pianist.

==Biography==
Harriet Cohen was born in London. Her younger sister was the singer Myra Verney (1905-1993) and she was a distant cousin of the pianist Irene Scharrer. She studied piano at the Royal Academy of Music under Tobias Matthay, having won the Ada Lewis scholarship at the age of 12 followed by the Sterndale Bennett Prize in 1913. She made her debut at a Chappell&#x27;s Sunday concert at the Queen&#x27;s Hall a year later. At this stage Cohen also had ambitions to be a composer: her &quot;Russian Impressions&quot; for piano (composed circa 1913) became her only original compositions to be published.

Her first major appearance was in 1920 when she appeared at the Wigmore Hall in a joint recital with the tenor John Coates. She became particularly associated with contemporary British music, giving the world premiere of Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27; Piano Concerto (which was written for her) and recording Edward Elgar&#x27;s Piano Quintet with the Stratton Quartet under the composer&#x27;s supervision. A number of composers wrote music specifically for her, including John Ireland, Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch and E. J. Moeran, and particularly Sir Arnold Bax (Cohen&#x27;s lover), who wrote most of his piano pieces for her. This includes the music for David Lean&#x27;s 1948 film version of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. He also composed Concertino for Left Hand for her after she lost the use of her right hand in 1948. The last six pieces in the collection &quot;Mikrokosmos&quot; by Bartók are dedicated to her.
Harriet Cohen dedicated an important effort to the performance of the Tudor composers at a time when this was unusual, and gave recitals of works by William Byrd and Orlando Gibbons and also of Henry Purcell. She was considered one of the finest performers of J. S. Bach&#x27;s keyboard music, winning outstanding praise from the musicologist Alfred Einstein. Pablo Casals, also, invited her to play Bach with his orchestra at Barcelona, and Wilhelm Furtwängler extended a similar invitation on hearing her in Switzerland. She gave the first &#x27;all-Bach&#x27; recital at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in 1925.

She also cultivated Spanish music, and gave the second performance of Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;Nights in the Gardens of Spain&quot;, a work which became especially associated with her. She was also an early exponent of music of the Soviet Union in Britain, and visited Russia in 1935 to broadcast from Moscow and Leningrad, including works by Shostakovich, Kabalevsky and Leonid Polovinkin. These composers later sent her further compositions.

Cohen&#x27;s influence went well beyond that of a musician. She became strongly associated in the 1930s with publicising the plight of German and Austrian Jews and even played a concert with the scientist Albert Einstein (Alfred&#x27;s cousin) in 1934 to raise funds to bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. She became a close friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and Ramsay MacDonald as well as the first president of Israel, Chaim Weizmann.

Cohen was also a close friend of many leading figures of the time. These included not only musicians such as Jean Sibelius, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Sir Edward Elgar and Sir William Walton, but also writers such as Arnold Bennett, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells and D. H. Lawrence as well as politicians or entrepreneurs such as Max Beaverbrook and Leslie Viscount Runciman. Cohen became one of the most talked-about and photographed musicians of her day.

She was vice-president of the Women&#x27;s Freedom League, and was for several years associated with the Jewish National Fund and the Palestine Conservatoire of Music at Jerusalem. Cohen was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1938. She was made Commander of the Order of the Crown of Belgium in 1947 and received the Order of the White Lion of Czechoslovakia that same year. The Harriet Cohen International Music Award was introduced in her honour in 1951. Also in 1951 she was awarded Officier de l’Académie française. She was made a Cavalier of the Order of the Southern Cross of Brazil in 1954 and was made a Freeman of the City of London in the same year. Also in 1954, she was a recipient in Helsinki of the medal of the Sibelius Academy. She received the Stella Della Solidarietà Italiana in 1955. In 1958 Cohen was awarded the Pro Finlandia Medal of the Order of the Lion of Finland for her services to Finnish music. 

She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1959 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.

She died in London. Her ashes rest in the Memorial Gardens at Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire.

== Efforts for refugees from Nazism ==
Harriet Cohen met the American journalist Dorothy Thompson in 1930 on her first tour of America, a tour which took in New York, Washington and the Library of Congress and Chicago, thus finally establishing a name for herself on the International stage. It was a meeting that was to change Cohen&#x27;s life and awaken her Jewish consciousness. In 1933 Harriet Cohen travelled to Vienna to play a number of concerts, staying with Dorothy Thompson. She was profoundly moved by the plight of refugees, both Jewish and non-Jewish, who were pouring into the city from Germany. Thompson and Cohen were to correspond about the plight of Jewish refugees in Austria and Germany. Cohen was then able to pass on information from Thompson directly to the British Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, who was at this time her intimate friend. Cohen met Thompson every time she went to America thereafter. From 1933 Cohen committed herself to work in Britain and the United States on behalf of refugees. This would result in a concert in America with Albert Einstein in 1934 to raise funds to bring Jewish scientists out of Germany.

In 1935 Ramsay MacDonald warned Cohen not to travel through Germany because the British Government would not be able to provide immunity for her. Soon after, Adolf Hitler passed the Nuremberg laws totally excluding Jews from public life.

Harriet Cohen had met Albert Einstein in Germany in 1929 when she had afternoon tea at his house. At the time Einstein disclosed that he played the violin and said that one day they should play together. Cohen kept her friendship with Einstein even after he had fled Germany in 1933. Cohen would often visit him in Oxford, England where he settled for a short time. Harriet&#x27;s sister Myra studied there at Somerville College, where she gave a piano concert. In 1934, after Einstein moved to the United States, Harriet Cohen did finally play that duet concert with Einstein to raise funds to bring Jewish scientists out of Nazi Germany. Cohen and Einstein remained friends thereafter and he referred to her as &quot;the beloved piano witch&quot;.

It was not until 1939 when she first met Chaim Weizmann, the future first President of Israel, that she began to support the Zionist cause and a Jewish homeland. Cohen&#x27;s 1939 visit to Palestine extended her reputation there both as a concert pianist and politically. She argued with British and Jewish officials to try to get Jewish refugees admitted on ships from Nazi Germany (rather than be returned), once almost precipitating an International incident. Harriet Cohen believed passionately in a Jewish homeland but with justice to the Arab Palestinians. She survived two assassination attempts during her trip to Palestine. It was when Cohen was having dinner with Weizmann in London that Weizmann heard the news of the British Government&#x27;s 1939 white paper to limit Jewish immigration to Britain to just 15,000 people a year. Blanche Dugdale, Arthur Balfour&#x27;s niece, a fellow diner, prophetically said in an agonised voice, &quot;What will happen to the millions fleeing from Hitler?&quot;

== Soviet composers ==
The visit in spring 1935 by Cohen to the Soviet Union was another major milestone in her career. It was the country from which her ancestors had fled 100 years earlier. Not only was Cohen bringing British music to the USSR by playing pieces by Vaughan Williams, Bax, Bliss and Ireland, she also performed Shostakovich&#x27;s Preludes, Kabalevsky&#x27;s Sonatina, and the Soviet premiere of Leonid Polovinkin&#x27;s Suite from manuscript. Thereafter she took their music all over Europe and was acclaimed as the first musician outside the USSR to learn Shostakovich&#x27;s Twenty-Four Preludes, which he composed in 1932 and 1933. Her contribution in bringing to the attention of the world the work of unknown Soviet composers is often forgotten.

== Relationship with Sir Arnold Bax ==

&quot;One day I will let my music give itself up to love – love without strife or fret or circumstances – just the praise to you&quot;. &quot;My mouth longs for your soft mouth...&quot;. These are just two quotes from the love letters between Sir Arnold Bax and Harriet Cohen.

Harriet Cohen&#x27;s love affair with Bax lasted for over forty years until he died in 1953. It was Bax who gave Harriet Cohen the name &quot;Tania&quot;, by which she was affectionately known by close friends and family. Their passionate affair started in 1914 when she was 19 and he was 31, although they had met two years earlier. Bax was creatively inspired by Cohen and in 1915 wrote for her within 13 days three pieces including &quot;The Princess&#x27;s Rose Garden&quot;, &quot;The Maiden with the Daffodil&quot; and &quot;In the Vodka Shop&quot;.

Some believe that their time together inspired his famous tone-poem &quot;Tintagel&quot;, in which he may have in part expressed his anguish at &quot;the dream their world denied&quot;. The affair led to Bax&#x27;s ultimate decision to leave his wife and children in 1918, but they could never live openly together because Bax&#x27;s wife refused a divorce. Neither could their relationship be recognised publicly because of the social climate of their generation. Cohen possibly became pregnant with Bax&#x27;s child in 1919 but if she did, she lost the child in an early miscarriage. Harriet Cohen&#x27;s recently published letters reveal the turbulence and anguish of the relationship. Cohen always claimed that the long-standing affair denied her becoming a &quot;Dame&quot;, but this is not substantiated. Through the 1930s their relationship became less passionate as her international career flourished, and Bax sought a quieter haven with his gentler mistress Mary Gleaves; nonetheless the affair continued and they remained close, as private letters between Cohen and Bax reveal. In 1936, for example, they travelled together to Stockholm and Helsinki and met Jean Sibelius, a composer who had long influenced Bax&#x27;s music. 
On 23 September 1947, Bax&#x27;s wife Elsa (&quot;Elsita&quot;) died. Cohen probably expected to finally marry Bax after an affair that had now lasted 30 years. Events were to unfold quite differently. Bax did not initially inform Cohen about the death of his wife, a fact she was to discover in May 1948 whilst recording the music that Bax had written for the film &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, when Elsa&#x27;s will was published. A greater shock followed, when Bax revealed his secret twenty-year affair with Gleaves and his intention not to remarry. This was at a time when Cohen was losing prominence in Britain, and in May 1948 Cohen had an accident with a tray of glasses, which severed the artery in her right hand thus restricting her performing career for some years.

When Bax died on 3 October 1953, Cohen was deeply affected by his death. His will bequeathed half of his interest from his literary and musical compositions to Cohen for life, and half to Mary Gleaves. After their death his royalties and estate were to pass to his children. Cohen also kept the London property that Bax had bought for her – throughout Cohen&#x27;s life Bax had financially assisted her.

== Other relationships ==

The British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald is one of her more prominent relationships. Harriet Cohen became close to MacDonald during the period when he was Prime Minister from 1929 to 1935, at a time of economic instability and depression which saw the rise of Nazism and Fascism in Europe. It was rumoured that MacDonald and Cohen became lovers. Their letters reflect a closeness; and she often visited him alone at 10 Downing Street and his home in Hampstead. Certainly many people did believe they were lovers and Cohen was often referred to as &quot;the old man&#x27;s darling&quot;.

Cohen was also close to Max Beaverbrook, the founder of Express newspapers and an important entrepreneur of the day. Cohen was introduced to the business tycoon Max Beaverbrook by Arnold Bennett in 1923. Beaverbrook was instantly charmed by Cohen and invited her to dine regularly with him from 1923 and through him met Lord Rothermere and Lloyd George. Beaverbrook and Cohen often met at her house, as noted in her autobiography &quot;A Bundle of Time&quot;. He was besotted with her in his own way and showered her regularly with a hundred or more roses.

Ralph Vaughan Williams was an intimate lifelong friend of Harriet Cohen. His letters to her reveal a flirtatious relationship, regularly reminding her of the thousands of kisses that she owed him. He was a regular visitor to her home and often attended Cohen&#x27;s little parties that she held for her friends. She loved entertaining and inviting famous and prominent people. Cohen premiered Vaughan Williams&#x27; &quot;Hymn Tune Prelude&quot; in 1930 which he dedicated to her. She later introduced the piece throughout Europe during her concert tours. In 1933 she then premiered his Piano Concerto in C major, a work which was once again dedicated to her. Cohen was given the exclusive right to play the piece for a period of time.

Harriet Cohen first played for Edward Elgar in 1914 at a party when she was 18. They became close friends and this lasted until his death in 1934. In 1933 Cohen organised a concert in his honour under the patronage of the King and Queen. Undoubtedly Elgar doted on Cohen and closely followed her career, giving her constant support. Under Elgar&#x27;s direction she made a recording of his Piano Quintet with the Stratton String Quartet. Elgar had only sketched it but he gave the short score to Harriet for the recording.

H. G. Wells was part of Harriet Cohen&#x27;s circle of male admirers from the 1920s. After Wells parted from writer and novelist Rebecca West, it is well known that Wells took up brief liaisons with other women. Harriet Cohen is highly likely to have been one of these, as various letters from her private collection and interviews suggest. She had a magnetic personality and beauty which Wells found irresistible.

D. H. Lawrence became a close friend of Harriet Cohen&#x27;s. It was clear already in 1915 that this friendship had created some tensions between Cohen and Arnold Bax. Bax protested at Cohen&#x27;s closeness to Lawrence. She told Lawrence that they would have to meet secretly. In demonstrative mood that day, Lawrence scrawled across her autograph book &quot;The door closed&quot;. A short time later Cohen contracted tuberculosis, possibly from Lawrence, who died of the disease in 1930. Cohen to Bax always denied any sexual relationship with Lawrence but many believed they were lovers. Nonetheless, Lawrence and Cohen remained good friends and were regularly seeing each other as least as part of a group of friends up until his death. They would often talk together about the music of their common friend, the musician Elgar.

Cohen was introduced to William Walton in 1923 by Arnold Bennett. They carried on a rather flirtatious friendship which Cohen described in her autobiography as &quot;stormy but delightful&quot;. She wrote that the irritation they often felt for each other did not lessen the underlying affection. Cohen championed Walton&#x27;s music both at home and abroad especially in the late 1920s and early &#x27;30s. On assigning to Cohen the premier performance of his Sinfonia Concertante in 1927 he said to her &quot;I know it will be in safe hands&quot;.

Rosa Newmarch introduced Harriet Cohen to Jean Sibelius in London 1921 and they spent some time together. In the summer 1936 Cohen travelled in Finland with Arnold Bax and they had long discussions with Sibelius both in Helsinki and Ainola. Sibelius even wrote her the opening chord of his eighth symphony on a cigarette packet. The Eighth Symphony was lost.

However, her most important relationship was probably with Arnold Bennett. &quot;Arnold Bennett, dear friend and mentor of my youth died on 27 March 1931&quot; wrote Cohen in her autobiography. Arnold Bennett was one of Cohen&#x27;s closest friends and responsible for introducing her to many of her new friends. Bennett introduced Cohen to William Walton and Max Beaverbrook in 1923. Cohen was devastated on Bennett&#x27;s sudden death from typhoid fever on 27 March 1931. She had spoken to him only a few days earlier, when he had told her how unwell he was feeling. It was Bennett who had kept Cohen on the rails for over a decade giving her honest, blunt necessary advice. Cohen listened to him and respected his judgement. He had guided her when she was in her 20s when her reputation and fame was growing both at home and abroad.

== Depictions ==
Harriet Cohen was portrayed in two novels.

Rebecca West based the main character of Harriet in her novel &quot;Harriet Hume&quot; (1929) on Harriet Cohen. The novel is described as a modernist story about a piano-playing prodigy and her obsessive lover, a corrupt politician. The novel immortalised Harriet&#x27;s love affair with the composer Arnold Bax.

William Gerhardie cast Cohen as the heroine Helen Sapphire in the book &quot;Pending Heaven&quot; and much of what is written mirrors Cohen&#x27;s own life and character as well as her turbulent relationship with Gerhardie. Helen Sapphire is a musician who performs successfully all over Europe. She plays the harp and the piano. Gerhardie personified himself in the central character of Max who dreams about Helen.

She was portrayed by Glenda Jackson in the 1992 Ken Russell film &quot;The Secret Life of Arnold Bax&quot;.

&quot;Dearest Tania&quot;, a words-and-music programme telling the story of Cohen, written by Duncan Honeybourne, premiered in 2006, performed with actress Louisa Clein.

<doc id="385523" wikidata="Q841267" url="?curid=385523" title="Tomography">
<text>Tomography is imaging by sections or sectioning that uses any kind of penetrating wave. The method is used in radiology, archaeology, biology, atmospheric science, geophysics, oceanography, plasma physics, materials science, cosmochemistry, astrophysics, quantum information, and other areas of science. The word &quot;tomography&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek τόμος &quot;tomos&quot;, &quot;slice, section&quot; and γράφω &quot;graphō&quot;, &quot;to write&quot; or, in this context as well, &quot;to describe.&quot; A device used in tomography is called a tomograph, while the image produced is a tomogram.

In many cases, the production of these images is based on the mathematical procedure tomographic reconstruction, such as X-ray computed tomography technically being produced from multiple projectional radiographs. Many different reconstruction algorithms exist. Most algorithms fall into one of two categories: filtered back projection (FBP) and iterative reconstruction (IR). These procedures give inexact results: they represent a compromise between accuracy and computation time required. FBP demands fewer computational resources, while IR generally produces fewer artifacts (errors in the reconstruction) at a higher computing cost.

Although MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), optical coherence tomography and ultrasound are transmission methods, they typically do not require movement of the transmitter to acquire data from different directions. In MRI, both projections and higher spatial harmonics are sampled by applying spatially varying magnetic fields; no moving parts are necessary to generate an image. On the other hand, since ultrasound and optical coherence tomography uses time-of-flight to spatially encode the received signal, it is not strictly a tomographic method and does not require multiple image acquisitions.

==Types of tomography==
Some recent advances rely on using simultaneously integrated physical phenomena, e.g. X-rays for both CT and angiography, combined CT/MRI and combined CT/PET.

Discrete tomography and Geometric tomography, on the other hand, are research areas that deal with the reconstruction of objects that are discrete (such as crystals) or homogeneous. They are concerned with reconstruction methods, and as such they are not restricted to any of the particular (experimental) tomography methods listed above.

===Synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy===
A new technique called synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) allows for detailed three-dimensional scanning of fossils.

The construction of third-generation synchrotron sources combined with the tremendous improvement of detector technology, data storage and processing capabilities since the 1990s has led to a boost of high-end synchrotron tomography in materials research with a wide range of different applications, e.g. the visualization and quantitative analysis of differently absorbing phases, microporosities, cracks, precipitates or grains in a specimen.
Synchrotron radiation is created by accelerating free particles in high vacuum. By the laws of electrodynamics this acceleration leads to the emission of electromagnetic radiation (Jackson, 1975). Linear particle acceleration is one possibility, but apart from the very high electric fields one would need it is more practical to hold the charged particles on a
closed trajectory in order to obtain a source of continuous radiation. Magnetic fields are used to force the particles onto the desired orbit and prevent them from flying in a straight line. The radial acceleration associated with the change of direction then generates radiation.

==Volume rendering==
Volume rendering is a set of techniques used to display a 2D projection of a 3D discretely sampled data set, typically a 3D scalar field. A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired, for example, by a CT, MRI, or MicroCT scanner. These are usually acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image pixels in a regular pattern.
This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or voxel represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.

To render a 2D projection of the 3D data set, one first needs to define a camera in space relative to the volume. Also, one needs to define the opacity and color of every voxel.
This is usually defined using an RGBA (for red, green, blue, alpha) transfer function that defines the RGBA value for every possible voxel value.

For example, a volume may be viewed by extracting isosurfaces (surfaces of equal values) from the volume and rendering them as polygonal meshes or by rendering the volume directly as a block of data. The marching cubes algorithm is a common technique for extracting an isosurface from volume data. Direct volume rendering is a computationally intensive task that may be performed in several ways.

==History==
Focal plane tomography was developed in the 1930s by the radiologist Alessandro Vallebona, and proved useful in reducing the problem of superimposition of structures in projectional radiography.

In a 1953 article in the medical journal &quot;Chest&quot;, B. Pollak of the Fort William Sanatorium described the use of planography, another term for tomography.

Focal plane tomography remained the conventional form of tomography until being largely replaced by mainly computed tomography in the late 1970s. Focal plane tomography uses the fact that the focal plane appears sharper, while structures in other planes appear blurred. By moving an X-ray source and the film in opposite directions during the exposure, and modifying the direction and extent of the movement, operators can select different focal planes which contain the structures of interest.

<doc id="385525" wikidata="Q228931" url="?curid=385525" title="Marcia Gay Harden">
<text>Marcia Gay Harden (born August 14, 1959) is an American actress. Her accolades include an Academy Award, a Tony Award, and nominations for four Primetime Emmy Awards.

Harden&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1990 with the Coen brothers&#x27; film &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;. She received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Pollock&quot; (2000) and &quot;Mystic River&quot; (2003), winning for her portrayal of artist Lee Krasner in the former. Her other notable film credits include &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; (1996), &quot;Flubber&quot; (1997), &quot;Space Cowboys&quot; (2000), &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; (2003), and the &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; film series (2015–2018).

Harden made her Broadway debut in 1993, starring in Tony Kushner&#x27;s epic play &quot;Angels in America: Millennium Approaches&quot;/&quot;Angels in America: Perestroika&quot; for which she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. She returned to Broadway in 2009 in Yasmina Reza&#x27;s comedic play &quot;God of Carnage&quot;, with her performance earning her the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.

Harden&#x27;s television credits include guest roles in the HBO series &quot;The Newsroom&quot; (2013–2014) and the ABC series &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot; (2015–2020), as well as main roles in the CBS series &quot;Code Black&quot; (2015–2018) and &quot;So Help Me Todd&quot; (2022–2024). She received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for her guest roles in the crime drama series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (2005) and the Apple TV+ series &quot;The Morning Show&quot;, and supporting role in the television film &quot;The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler&quot; (2009).

== Early life ==
Harden was born in the La Jolla area of San Diego, California, the daughter of Texas natives Beverly Harden (née Bushfield), a housewife, and Thad Harold Harden (1932–2002), who was a Captain and fighter pilot who served 30 years in the United States Navy. She has three sisters and one brother.

Harden&#x27;s brother is named Thaddeus, as are her father and her former husband. Harden&#x27;s family frequently moved because of her father&#x27;s job, living in Japan, Germany, Greece, California, and Maryland.

Harden graduated from Surrattsville High School in Clinton, Maryland in 1976. She received a Bachelor of Arts in theater from the University of Texas at Austin in 1980. Harden received a Master of Fine Arts from New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts in 1988.

==Career==
Harden&#x27;s first film role was in a 1979 student-produced film at the University of Texas. Throughout the 1980s, she appeared in several television programs, including &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, and &quot;CBS Summer Playhouse&quot;. She appeared in &quot;The Imagemaker&quot; (1986), her first film screen role, in which she played a stage manager. She appeared in the Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; (1990), a 1930s mobster drama in which she first gained wide exposure. Even so, at the time, living in New York City, she had to go back to doing catering jobs &quot;because I didn&#x27;t have any money&quot;.

Harden debuted on Broadway in the role of Harper Pitt (and others) in Tony Kushner&#x27;s &quot;Angels in America&quot; in 1993. The role earned her critical acclaim and she received a Tony Award nomination (Best Featured Actress in a Play).

Harden played actress Ava Gardner alongside Philip Casnoff as Frank Sinatra in the 1992 made-for-TV miniseries &quot;Sinatra&quot;. Throughout the 1990s, she continued to appear in films and television. Her notable film roles include the Disney sci-fi comedy &quot;Flubber&quot; (1997), a popular hit in which she co-starred with Robin Williams; the supernatural drama &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; (1998), playing the under-appreciated daughter of a tycoon (Anthony Hopkins, co-starring Brad Pitt); &quot;Labor of Love&quot; (1998), a Lifetime television film in which she starred with David Marshall Grant; and &quot;Space Cowboys&quot; (2000), an all-star adventure-drama about aging astronauts.

In 2000, Harden won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of painter Lee Krasner in the biographical film &quot;Pollock&quot;. In 2004, she received a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the mystery crime drama &quot;Mystic River&quot;.

Harden guest-starred as FBI undercover agent Dana Lewis posing as a white supremacist in &quot;Raw&quot;, an episode of the popular crime drama &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. This role earned Harden her first Emmy Award nomination for best guest actress in a drama series in 2007. She reprised the role in the series&#x27; eighth-season premiere and again in the 12th-season episode &quot;Penetration&quot; as a rape victim.

Harden appeared in several 2007 films, including Sean Penn&#x27;s &quot;Into the Wild&quot; and Frank Darabont&#x27;s &quot;The Mist&quot; (opposite Thomas Jane and Laurie Holden), based on the novella by Stephen King. Also in 2007, she shared top billing with Kevin Bacon in &quot;Rails &amp; Ties&quot;, the directorial debut of Alison Eastwood. Harden played a woman who has a mastectomy in &quot;Home&quot; (2008). (Her character in &quot;Rails &amp; Ties&quot; also had a mastectomy.) Scenes in both films required her to bare her breasts, with the missing breast removed using computer-generated imagery. In &quot;Home&quot;, her co-stars include her daughter, Eulala Scheel. Harden starred in the &quot;Christmas Cottage&quot;, a story of the early artistic beginnings of the painter Thomas Kinkade.

Harden appeared as a regular on the FX series &quot;Damages&quot; as a shrewd corporate attorney opposite Glenn Close and William Hurt in 2009. She received a 2009 Emmy nomination for her role in &quot;The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler&quot;, a TV film also starring Oscar-winner Anna Paquin. She was a Best Supporting Actress in a TV Movie/Miniseries nominee and lost to Shohreh Aghdashloo. If she had won this Emmy, Harden would have entered the elite group of &quot;triple-crown&quot; actors, those who have won the profession&#x27;s three highest honors: the Academy Award (film), the Tony Award (stage), and the Emmy Award (television).

Harden co-starred with Elliot Page and Drew Barrymore in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Whip It&quot;, which proved a critical success. She also appeared in the comedy &quot;The Maiden Heist&quot; (2009) with Christopher Walken and Morgan Freeman.

Harden returned to Broadway in Yasmina Reza&#x27;s &quot;God of Carnage&quot;, co-starring with James Gandolfini, Hope Davis and Jeff Daniels, in 2009. All three actors were nominated for a Tony Award; Harden won Best Actress in a Play.

Harden reunited with her former Broadway co-star Jeff Daniels as a new cast member on HBO&#x27;s series &quot;The Newsroom&quot; in 2013. She played Christian Grey&#x27;s mother, Grace Trevelyan Grey, in the &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; film series from 2015 to 2018. Also in 2015, she began a starring role in the TV series &quot;Code Black&quot;. She stars in the 2022 CBS drama &quot;So Help Me Todd&quot;, since renewed for a second season.

In 1996, Harden married Thaddaeus Scheel, a prop master, with whom she worked on &quot;The Spitfire Grill&quot;. They have three children. In February 2012, Harden filed for divorce from Scheel.

Harden owned property in the Catskills and a townhouse in Harlem. She sold the Harlem townhouse in 2012.

Harden is an avid potter, which she learned in high school, and then took up again while acting in &quot;Angels in America&quot;. She is also a practitioner of &quot;ikebana&quot;, the art of Japanese flower arrangement, which her mother learned while they lived in Japan. She gave a brief demonstration in 2007 on &quot;The Martha Stewart Show&quot; and presented some works of her family, as well. 

In May 2018, a memoir called &quot;The Seasons of My Mother: A Memoir of Love, Family, and Flowers&quot; was published. The book details the story and bond of mother and daughter throughout time and how they are dealing with the largest struggle yet, her mother&#x27;s Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Harden created works of &quot;ikebana&quot; specifically for this book to illustrate the different seasons of her mother&#x27;s life.

<doc id="385536" wikidata="Q851509" url="?curid=385536" title="Bev Harris">
<text>Bev Harris is an American writer, activist, and founder of Black Box Voting, a national, nonpartisan elections watchdog group. She helped popularize the term &quot;black box voting&quot;, while authoring a book of that title.

Original investigative work by Harris has been featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, CNN, ABC, MSNBC, CBS, Fox News, and NBC, as well as by the Associated Press, NPR, and many other mainstream news outlets.

In 2006, HBO released the documentary &quot;Hacking Democracy&quot;, which follows Bev Harris and Kathleen Wynne, director and associate director of Black Box Voting, respectively. &quot;Hacking Democracy&quot; was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Long Form Investigative Journalism.

==Diebold Investigation==
In 2003, she discovered the source code of voting machine manufacturer Diebold Election Systems, which changed its name in 2006 to Premier Election Solutions.

After examining these files, Harris wrote an article on July 8, 2003, detailing how to bypass passwords and manipulate election results on the Diebold GEMS central tally system. The information in Harris&#x27;s article was subsequently confirmed by internal memos written by Diebold&#x27;s own engineers.

Researchers at Rice University and Johns Hopkins University also studied the programs she obtained and found security weaknesses that afforded opportunities for abuse Diebold officials and state election officials disputed the findings of the Rice and Johns Hopkins researchers.

An organization founded as a nonprofit by Harris, Black Box Voting, was invited by Ion Sancho, Leon County, Florida Supervisor of Elections to conduct a series of tests of Diebold&#x27;s GEMS central tabulator and Diebold&#x27;s optical scan voting machines. The tests took place February 14, 2005; May 2, 2005; May 26, 2005 and December 13, 2005, and allege to prove that Diebold machines were not secure and could be hacked and results altered.

Her work to expose security weaknesses in electronic voting systems was assisted by Kathleen Wynne and is featured in an HBO documentary, &quot;Hacking Democracy&quot;. The film follows a series of investigations, many of them captured live on videotape by Kathleen Wynne.

In a public records request, Harris discovered that counterfeit audit records had been provided to Black Box Voting. Harris subsequently found some of the original records in the garbage at a Volusia County warehouse. Florida Fair Elections Coalition founder Susan Pynchon and Broward Election Reform Coalition founder Ellen Brodsky found more original poll tapes in the garbage behind the Volusia County elections office.

Harris, Wynne, and Andy Stephenson audited the originals against those given out by Volusia County in public records requests. Data on several of the poll tapes found in the garbage did not match data on the tapes provided in public records; many key audit items were missing, and unusual errors (such as a date-stamps 16,000 years in the future on one tape) indicated the alterations appeared to be due to alterations in programming the device that produces the poll tapes. Harris, Wynne and &quot;Hacking Democracy&quot; producer Russell Michaels, arranged for a series of hacking demonstrations on the &quot;GEMS&quot; central tabulator and also the hacking of memory cards. The finding of the records in the trash, along with the hacks, can be viewed in the HBO documentary &quot;Hacking Democracy&quot;, which premiered November 2, 2006.

==Other investigations==
In March 2006, Black Box Voting was contacted by elections official Bruce Funk, from Emery County, Utah. Black Box Voting again secured the services of Harri Hursti and Dr. Herbert Hugh Thompson and examined the Diebold TSx touch-screen (DRE) system. Hursti, Thompson, and a member of the Black Box Voting board of directors, Jim March, found flaws which prompted emergency warnings and last minute corrective actions in Pennsylvania, California, and other states.

Harris&#x27;s investigations into the testing laboratories that examine voting system software were revealed in a hidden camera interview in &quot;Hacking Democracy&quot;; she also obtained test laboratory reports that showed Ciber Laboratories omitted security testing on the machines.

Harris also identified and broke the story on the criminal records of a number of individuals who owned, programmed, and printed ballots in the elections industry.

==Diebold lawsuit==
Together with Jim March, Harris filed a whistleblower lawsuit, alleging that Diebold Election Systems had made false claims when selling their system to Alameda County, California. In late 2004, Diebold agreed to pay the state of California $2.6 million to settle the case, and paid approximately $76,000 to Harris, which she donated to the then-nonprofit Black Box Voting organization.

== VoteHere investigation ==
She has been served with four cease and desist notices and in 2004, was interviewed by the United States Secret Service Cybercrime Task Force five times in connection with a claim by VoteHere, an electronic voting software company in Bellevue, Washington, that their site had been &quot;hacked&quot;, with their source code stolen. In connection with this, Harris received a gag order from a U.S. Attorney in preparation for a federal grand jury investigation. An article by &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; covered this.

<doc id="385537" wikidata="Q776556" url="?curid=385537" title="Ryde">
<text>Ryde is an English seaside town and civil parish on the north-east coast of the Isle of Wight. The built-up area had a population of 24,096 according to the 2021 Census. Its growth as a seaside resort came after the villages of Upper Ryde and Lower Ryde were merged in the 19th century, as can still be seen in the town&#x27;s central and seafront architecture. The resort&#x27;s expansive sands are revealed at low tide. Their width means the regular ferry service to the mainland requires a long listed pier – the fourth longest in the United Kingdom, and the oldest surviving.

==History==
In 1782 numerous bodies of men, women and children from HMS &quot;Royal George&quot;, which sank suddenly at Spithead, were washed ashore at Ryde. Many were buried on land that is now occupied by the Esplanade. A memorial to them was erected in June 2004.

There are a series of Regency and Victorian buildings in the town with important buildings such as All Saints&#x27; Church, designed by the eminent George Gilbert Scott, and Ryde Town Hall, which was completed in 1831. Up until the pier was opened in 1814, ferry passengers landing at low tide were brought almost half a mile into the shore by horse and cart.

==Governance==

Ryde Town Council represents the residents of Ryde. Ryde Town Council is a statutory consultee in planning matters regarding Ryde. Their views are taken into account by the local planning authority, Isle of Wight Council.

Ryde residents are represented by Ward Councillors on the Isle of Wight Council.

==Transport==

There is a hovercraft service to Southsea, which takes nine minutes. It is operated by Hovertravel near the Esplanade close to Ryde Esplanade railway station and the bus station. A catamaran service run by Wightlink operates from Ryde Pier to Portsmouth Harbour, which connects with both Island Line trains and mainland trains to London Waterloo.

The Island Line Trains service runs from Ryde Pier Head via Ryde Esplanade to Shanklin, a distance of . Ryde St John&#x27;s Road railway station lies further south in the town.

The bus interchange lies between Ryde Pier and the Hover Terminal on the Esplanade. Ryde is the second busiest stop in the Southern Vectis network after Newport. The busiest route is No. 9 to Newport, running every 10 minutes in the daytime. Others include Nos 2, 3, 4 and 8 and local route 37. An open-top bus service, &quot;The Downs Tour&quot;, runs in the summer.

==Amenities==

The town&#x27;s large and long esplanade area has always been an attraction for tourists, especially those day-tripping from the mainland, as the amenities are all available by walking from the pier. A swimming pool, bowls club, bowling alley, and boating lake are among the attractions, and there are various children&#x27;s playgrounds, amusement arcades and cafés.

Ryde has few large public open spaces beyond the esplanade, but areas for public recreation include Appley Park, Puckpool Park, Vernon Square, Simeon Street Recreation Ground, St John&#x27;s Park, St Thomas&#x27; churchyard, Salter Road recreation ground, and Oakfield Football Club.

At one time Ryde had two separate piers; the other being the Victoria Pier, no longer in existence. Ryde has its own inshore rescue service, which mostly deals with people stranded on sandbanks as the incoming tide cuts them off from the shore. The pier is also a feature on the Isle of Wight Coastal Path, which is marked with blue signs bearing a white seagull.

Ryde has a small marina located to the east of Ryde Pier. It is tidal and dries out at low water, hence it is more suitable for smaller sailing (bilge keel) and motor cruisers. It has provision for up to 200 boats, either on floating pontoons or leaning against the harbour wall. It has a full-time harbour master, who posts information outside the harbour office, including weather reports, tide times, cruise-liner movements and anniversary events.

The town centre is on a hill, with local shops and chain retailers.

==Buildings==

The twin church spires visible from the sea belong to All Saints&#x27; (the taller) and Holy Trinity churches. All Saints&#x27; Church is located in Queens Road on a road junction known as &quot;Five Ways&quot;. It was designed by George Gilbert Scott and completed in 1872. The spire is tall. Holy Trinity Church is in Dover Street. It was designed by Thomas Hellyer and completed in 1845. Holy Trinity Church closed in January 2014 and the building became the Aspire Ryde community centre.

St James&#x27; is a further Church of England church in the centre of Ryde, on Lind Street. It was constructed in 1827 as a proprietary chapel and continues to be active, with services at 10:30am and 6:30pm each Sunday and a range of youth and mid-week groups.

The town&#x27;s Roman Catholic church, St Mary&#x27;s in High Street, was built in 1846 at a cost of £18,000, provided by Elizabeth, Countess of Clare. It was designed by Joseph Hansom, inventor of the hansom cab. Other churches include the Anglican St James Church and St. Michael and All Angels, Swanmore. There are also Baptist, Methodist, United Reformed and Elim churches in the town.
Ryde Castle, situated on the Esplanade, was built about 1840 as a private house in crenellated style and is now a hotel. It was heavily damaged by a fire in 2012 and underwent major restoration in 2013.

Beldornie Tower on Augusta Road was at one point a property of the Earl of Yarborough. Dating back to the 16th or early 17th century, the house was virtually rebuilt about 1840 in Gothic-Jacobean style. A west wing was added in 1880.

Ryde School With Upper Chine stands opposite All Saints&#x27; Church. The chief building, Westmont, is Grade II listed.

==Entertainment==
Sited on the Esplanade are an ice rink and a pavilion. The former is no longer open to the public, and the Isle of Wight&#x27;s ice-hockey team, the Wightlink Raiders, has disbanded. The pavilion houses a bowling alley and night club.

The town&#x27;s local football team, for many years Ryde Sports F.C., has given way to Ryde Saints F.C. and Ryde F.C.

Speedway is staged just south of the town at Smallbrook Stadium. The Isle of Wight Islanders started as members of the Conference League before moving up to the Premier League.

===Carnivals===
Ryde has five carnivals in a typical year: the Mardi Gras in June (known as the Arts Parade from 2003 to 2012), Children&#x27;s, Main and Illuminated processions at the end of August, and a Lantern Parade in December. The Carnival at Ryde is England&#x27;s oldest.

<text>Shanklin () is a seaside resort town and civil parish on the Isle of Wight, England, located on Sandown Bay. Shanklin is the southernmost of three settlements which occupy the bay, and is close to Lake and Sandown. The sandy beach, its Old Village and a wooded ravine, Shanklin Chine, are its main attractions. The esplanade along the beach is occupied by hotels and restaurants for the most part, and is one of the most tourist-oriented parts of the town. The other is the Old Village, at the top of Shanklin Chine.
Together with Lake and Sandown to the north, Shanklin forms a built up area of around 25,000 inhabitants, Shanklin alone contributing around 7,200 of this.

==Shopping==

The main shopping centre consists of two roads, Regent Street and High Street, which together comprise the largest retail area in the south of the Isle of Wight; significant for tourists but also as an amenity for residents.

Near Regent Street are the town&#x27;s two main supermarkets, the Co-op and Lidl. In Regent Street itself are many local shops, including two arts and crafts shops, several clothing and sports shops, three newsagents and three bakeries. The high street also has some local shops, but is dominated by tourist shops and restaurants.

==Transport==
Shanklin railway station is the terminus of the Island Line from Ryde, opened on 23 August 1864. The railway was extended south to Ventnor in 1866, but this section was closed in 1966. The line from Ryde to Shanklin is now operated by former London Underground tube trains. In October 2004 a direct link was revived in the form of a bus service named the &quot;Rail link&quot;. This was discontinued in 2010 but was replaced by the Southern Vectis number 3 bus.

Bus services to nearby towns and suburbs are run by Southern Vectis, mainly on routes 2, 3, 22 and 24, principally from the bus stands at the Co-op supermarket. Destinations served include Newchurch, Newport, Ryde, Sandown, Ventnor and Winford. In the summer, an open top bus route called &quot;The Sandown Bay Tour&quot; is run, serving the main tourist areas of Shanklin and running to Sandown.

==Culture==

Shanklin has one theatre, Shanklin Theatre, which is just off the top end of the High Street.

In July and August 1819 the poet John Keats lodged at Eglantine Cottage in the resort&#x27;s High Street, where he completed the first book of &quot;Lamia&quot; and began a drama, &quot;Otho the Great&quot;, with his friend Charles Armitage Brown.

In July 1868 the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow stayed at the Crab Inn in Shanklin&#x27;s Old Village during his last visit to Europe and left a poem about it on a stone by the pub. It is not generally held to be amongst his best work.

The 1980s indiepop band Trixie&#x27;s Big Red Motorbike were from Shanklin, and recorded some of their records there.

Victoria Cross recipient and Deputy Governor of the Isle of Wight, Colonel Henry Gore-Browne retired to Shanklin before his death in 1912.

According to Joseph Jacobs&#x27;s influential 1890 version of &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot;, the &quot;Three Pigs and the Wolf&quot; live near Shanklin.

In &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, season 4, &quot;Mr Neutron&quot;, Michael Palin plays a US commander who calls upon &quot;Moscow! Peking! and Shanklin, Isle of Wight!&quot;. A voice over continues &quot;And so the Great Powers and the people of Shanklin, Isle of Wight, drew their net in ever-tightening circles around the most dangerous threat to peace the world has ever faced.&quot;

==Beaches and esplanade==


Shanklin is on the coast of Sandown Bay, and therefore is part of the long beach which spans between Yaverland in the north to Luccombe in the south. The section of beach situated next to Shanklin is split into Small Hope Beach and Hope Beach. Above Hope Beach is the esplanade which boasts some traditional seaside attractions including an amusement arcade, a crazy golf course, and a children&#x27;s play area, with slides, ball pools, bouncy castles, rigging, swings etc. available to be hired for a child&#x27;s birthday party. There are several seafront hotels, a cliff lift from the seafront to the top of the cliff, a putting course, several cafes and restaurants and pubs, and a large, clean beach. Shanklin_Pier was destroyed in the Great Storm of 1987. The pier formerly had a theatre at which many famous performers appeared, including Paul Robeson, Richard Tauber and Arthur Askey (whose daughter attended Upper Chine School for Girls). The Summerland Amusement Arcade on the seafront was formerly a seaplane hangar positioned at Bembridge where it housed Fairey Campania seaplanes of the Nizam of Hyderabad&#x27;s Squadron. Large areas of the seafront were severely damaged or destroyed during the bombing raids of World War II, but were quickly rebuilt after the war, causing the current seafront to be a varied mixture of Victorian, inter-war and post-war architecture.

Shanklin Sailing Club is situated at the North end of the Esplanade. Founded in 1931 as Shanklin Amateur Sailing Club&#x27;, the club has a fleet of Sprint 15 catamarans and holds races three days a week during the season.

At the south end of the beach is Shanklin Chine, from which the town takes its name, historically &quot;Chynklyng Chine&quot; and in the Domesday Book of 1086 Sencliz (held by William FitzAzor; Jocelyn FitzAzor) from &quot;Scen-hlinc&quot;. The chine is operated as a visitor attraction and continues up to Rylstone Gardens in the Old Village. It contains a small section of the pipe of the Operation Pluto pipeline which ran across the Isle of Wight and out from Shanklin and another branch from Sandown to supply fuel to the D-Day beaches.

== Nature ==
America Wood is a Site of Special Scientific Interest located between Shanklin and Whiteley Bank. It is owned by the Woodland Trust. It takes a bit of stamina and determination to get into America Wood, on the outskirts of Shanklin, since it has little accessible parking. However, the more active Isle of Wight visitor can make use of public footpaths and bridleways that lead into the wood. There is an ‘open’ feel to the site with storm damage during the Great Storm of 1987 and the Burns&#x27; Day storm of 1990 felling trees and creating many open sections. There is one particularly large glade which is gradually recovering from the storms. The wood is situated just west of Ninham.

Dunnose is a large cape which is situated southwest of the town. An imposing and high geological feature, it has served as a triangulation point for maps of the United Kingdom, and has also been the site of several shipwrecks, most infamously that of HMS &quot;Eurydice&quot;, which sank with the loss of 300 people aboard.

Shanklin is also the location where Charles Darwin wrote his &quot;Origin of Species&quot; during an 18-month-long visit to the town.

==Climate==
Shanklin has an oceanic climate (Cfb) with mild summers, cool nights, rainy winters and average temperature nights. Shanklin is one of the sunniest villages in Great Britain.

==Churches==
There are three Anglican churches in Shanklin. St.Paul&#x27;s Church in Regent Street has the bell from HMS Eurydice (1843), which sank off Dunnose Point and is the subject of a poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins. St. Blasius Church, Shanklin – better known as Shanklin Old Church – is to the south of the town and has bell ropes hanging in the nave and a fine lych-gate. The Church of St. Saviour-on-the-Cliff, Shanklin is the biggest in the town and is in Queen&#x27;s Road.

The Isle of Wight United Reformed Church is situated in Shanklin.

== Twin towns ==
Shanklin is twinned with Coupvray, a town in the Île-de-France region of France.

<doc id="385542" wikidata="Q880839" url="?curid=385542" title="Blackgang Chine">
<text>Blackgang Chine is the oldest amusement park in the United Kingdom, having opened in 1843. Named after a now-destroyed chine (a coastal ravine) in the soft Cretaceous cliffs, it is about 6 miles from Ventnor at the southern tip of the Isle of Wight just below St Catherine&#x27;s Down. Blackgang Chine are owned by the Dabell family. The park includes multiple themed &quot;lands&quot;, including Pirate Cove, Restricted Area 5, Fairy Land and Village, and Cowboy Town. Owing to the unstable land on which the park is situated, landslides occur frequently, meaning that attractions have been moved further inland to safer ground on several occasions.

==History==
During Blackgang Chine&#x27;s early years, the area was a steep gaunt ravine, overlooking Chale Bay, stretching around three-quarters of a mile down to the shore. It was a quiet place, visited by few people other than local fishermen with rumours of a thriving smuggling trade, which has now become a key theme of the park. On 11 October 1836 the cargo ship &quot;Clarendon&quot; was wrecked at the foot of Blackgang Chine, with the loss of many aboard.

During Victorian times, people were seeking out new healthy holiday resorts, ideally near the coast. As the railway network was getting closer and closer to the south coast, the Isle of Wight was becoming an increasingly attractive holiday destination. Alexander Dabell, the founder of the park, soon realised the business potential of this, trying various ventures. In 1839 Alexander became friends with a publican who had recently built a hotel at Blackgang, which now forms the Chine Cafe (formerly Pirates&#x27; Pantry restaurant) and administration offices.
After studying the gault and chine gorge, he knew instantly that gardens could be set up that would appeal to the Victorians as a romantic holiday destination. This along with the increasing popularity of the adjacent Sandrock Spring (a chalybeate spring) led to Alexander concluding a lease for the site in 1842 and the establishment of Blackgang Chine amusement park in 1843. The area was then opened up to the public with pathways built down to the ravine and gardens landscaped on the cliffs. Steps were built to give access to the beach from the lower road. Since the park was opened, it has remained a family business, with the descendants of Alexander Dabell owning it ever since. The park&#x27;s claim to have been established in 1843 would make it the oldest theme park in the United Kingdom. Its initial theme of a general-purpose scenic and curiosity park led to one of its most famous attractions, a large whale skeleton, which had been washed up near the coast of The Needles in 1842, and is still a showpiece today.

===The chine today===
Owing to continual landslides, the chine itself has been destroyed, and coastal erosion still has a significant impact on the area today. The park&#x27;s focus now is themed entertainment for families with young children, lifesize animatronic dinosaurs being a noted feature. The same owners run a sister site, the Robin Hill countryside adventure park. Clifftop walks in and around the area give panoramic views of the English Channel and the south-western Isle of Wight coast.

According to a May 2000 talk to the Isle of Wight Postcard Club by the then director, Mr Simon Dabell, the etymology is simply &quot;black pathway&quot; (the original appearance of the chine), but the theme park understandably fosters the interpretation of a smuggling origin. Thus visitors to the park are greeted by a gigantic fibreglass statue of a smuggler between whose legs they could pass to enter.

The Blackgang Chine park is featured in the book &quot;Bollocks to Alton Towers&quot;, a humorous book concerned with &quot;uncommonly British days out&quot;. It was chosen for its apparent eccentricity. Blackgang Chine is also featured in a documentary based on &quot;Bollocks to Alton Towers&quot; called &quot;Far From the Sodding Crowd&quot;. In a 2010 interview, star of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films Rupert Grint praised the park, stating that his family&#x27;s favourite holiday was visiting the Isle of Wight, their favourite attraction being Blackgang Chine.

The park is frequently associated with ghosts, particularly related to smugglers, with several tales of sightings around the park. In 2008 a video was recorded, showing what appeared to be the apparition of a girl in a blue dress.

==Geology==

Sited below the village of Blackgang at the western end of the Undercliff, Blackgang Chine was, historically, a spectacular ravine (in 1800 a &quot;steep gaunt ravine&quot; descending 500 feet over about ).

The location is based on unstable terrain owing to the underlying Gault Clay strata, resulting in a succession of huge landslips giving the area a very rugged appearance akin to the better known Jurassic Coast. Currently the cliffs are eroding at a rate of about 3.5 metres per year, although this process is not gradual nor consistent. Continuing landslides and coastal erosion swept away the paths in the early 1900s, and have since obliterated the chine itself and repeatedly forced the park owners to move the clifftop facilities inland.

==Park guide==
The park covers over 40 acres of cliff-top gardens and themed &#x27;lands&#x27;, containing outdoor rides and walkthrough attractions, plus heritage exhibitions. Below is a list of the attractions currently in operation at the park:

==Former attractions==

==Accidents==

* In summer 2022, Shipwrecked&#x27;s hydraulic arm collapsed while the ride was in operation. The park was closed for the rest of the day and the ride was closed during investigations.

==Latest developments==

In 2010, a new section to the park opened; &quot;Blackgang&#x27;s Disappearing Village&quot;. This was produced in conjunction with the BBC programme &quot;Coast&quot;, and featured presenter Dick Strawbridge in its video exhibits. It told the story of the island&#x27;s coast and illustrated the cliff falls and erosion that Blackgang suffered over the years. Approximately half of this exhibition was later removed and converted to the new Hall of Mirrors in 2016. The remaining portion includes the park&#x27;s original 19-metre-long skeleton of a fin whale, and a simulator designed to mimic the experience of the landslips which occurred at Blackgang.

In 2011, a &#x27;Fairy Land&#x27; section was developed adjacent to the Fairy Castle. The following year, the pirate ship play area was redesigned as &#x27;Pirate Cove&#x27;, with two new pirate ships, and surrounded by other smaller themed buildings, a pirate shooting gallery, and &#x27;The Sailors Return&#x27; (now &#x27;The Vortex&#x27;), in which visitors walk through a spinning tunnel of lights designed to disorientate.

&#x27;Restricted Area 5&#x27; opened in 2014; a modernisation of the park&#x27;s previous &#x27;Dinosaurland&#x27;. It features new animatronic dinosaurs which move and roar when visitors approach. Some of the original fibreglass dinosaurs have been retained in the new walkthrough.

In 2015, Cowboy Town was remodelled, with new buildings and scenery. A family of animatronic Triceratops was also added to Restricted Area 5. This replaced the &#x27;Mouth of Hell&#x27;, a giant devilish &#x27;mouth&#x27; that visitors could climb into.

In 2016, The Triassic Club attraction was removed, and the area was redeveloped as a new, larger space for &#x27;The Mouth of Hell&#x27;, which is now encircled by a new walkway themed with fallen angel statues and demonic sounds.

For the opening of the 2017 &#x27;Underwater Kingdom&#x27; attraction, the Fantasyland area of the park was completely redeveloped, resulting in the removal of &#x27;The Weather Wizard&#x27;, &#x27;The Angry Dragon&#x27; and &#x27;The Licorice Factory&#x27; attractions. The animated &#x27;Smugglers Cave&#x27; walkthrough was also removed and a new similar structure was built in its place to form the entrance to the &#x27;Underwater Kingdom&#x27;.

As of 2018 and after 56 years, the Water Gardens are no longer part of the park. Demolition of the area began in 2016, with the last of the three remaining ponds nearest the cliff edge being filled in during the winter of 2017.

For the park&#x27;s 2022 season, two new rides were opened; a drop ride called ‘Evolution’ and a rotating boat ride named ‘Shipwrecked’.

For the park&#x27;s 2023 season and 180th anniversary a new 18 meter, 360 degree pendulum ride named &quot;Extinction&quot; was opened.

Christmas 2023 saw Blackgang Chine open its doors for the first time ever on selected dates in December. A pop up Christmas shop, complete with tree, decorations and a coffee shop selling Blackgang chine and Christmas themed gifts. The park itself was not open to the public.

<text>Polemic ( , ) is contentious rhetoric intended to support a specific position by forthright claims and to undermine the opposing position. The practice of such argumentation is called polemics, which are seen in arguments on controversial topics. A person who writes polemics, or speaks polemically, is called a polemicist. The word derives , .

Polemics often concern questions in religion or politics. A polemical style of writing was common in Ancient Greece, as in the writings of the historian Polybius. Polemic again became common in medieval and early modern times. Since then, famous polemicists have included satirist Jonathan Swift, Italian physicist and mathematician Galileo, French theologian  Jean Calvin, French Enlightenment writer, historian, and philosopher Voltaire, Russian author Leo Tolstoy, socialist philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, novelist George Orwell, playwright George Bernard Shaw, communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, linguist Noam Chomsky, social critics H.L. Mencken, Christopher Hitchens and Peter Hitchens, and existential philosophers Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche. 

Polemical journalism was common in continental Europe when libel laws were not as stringent as they are now. To support study of 17th to 19th century controversies, a British research project has placed online thousands of polemical pamphlets from that period. Discussions of atheism, humanism, and Christianity have remained open to polemic into the 21st century.

==History==
In Ancient Greece, writing was characterised by what Geoffrey Lloyd and Nathan Sivin called &quot;strident adversariality&quot; and &quot;rationalistic aggressiveness&quot;, summed up by McClinton as polemic. For example, the ancient historian Polybius practiced &quot;quite bitter self-righteous polemic&quot; against some twenty philosophers, orators, and historians.

Polemical writings were common in medieval and early modern times. During the Middle Ages, polemic had a religious dimension, as in Jewish texts written to protect and dissuade Jewish communities from converting to other religions. Medieval Christian writings were also often polemical; for example in their disagreements on Islam or in the vast corpus aimed at converting the Jews. Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;95 Theses&quot; was a polemic launched against the Catholic Church. Robert Carliell&#x27;s 1619 defence of the new Church of England and diatribe against the Roman Catholic Church – – took the form of a 250-line poem.

Major political polemicists of the 18th century include Jonathan Swift, with pamphlets such as his &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;, Alexander Hamilton, with pieces such as &quot;A Full Vindication of the Measures of Congress&quot; and &quot;A Farmer Refuted&quot;, and Edmund Burke, with his attack on the Duke of Bedford.

In the 19th century, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels&#x27;s 1848 &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; was extremely polemical. Both Marx and Engels would publish further polemical works, with Engels&#x27;s work &quot;Anti-Dühring&quot; serving as a polemic against Eugen Dühring, and Marx&#x27;s &quot;Critique of the Gotha Programme&quot; against Ferdinand Lasalle.

Vladimir Lenin published polemics against political opponents. &quot;The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky&quot; was notably directed against Karl Kautsky, and other works such as &quot;The State and Revolution&quot; attacked figures including Eduard Bernstein.

In the 20th century, George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot; was a polemic against totalitarianism, in particular of Stalinism in the Soviet Union. According to McClinton, other prominent polemicists of the same century include such diverse figures as Herbert Marcuse, Noam Chomsky, John Pilger, and Michael Moore.

Conservative Jewish Austrian writer and journalist Karl Kraus (1890-1935) considers the topic of moral collapse in his polemic writings. Karl Kraus produced and published 922 issues of the fifteen-daily magazine called Die Fackel (The Torch) until his death. Ludwig Wittgenstein, Sigmund Freud, Ernest Mach write in a similar manner and style to Kraus;

In 2007 Brian McClinton argued in &quot;Humani&quot; that anti-religious books such as Richard Dawkins&#x27;s &quot;The God Delusion&quot; are part of the polemic tradition. In 2008 the humanist philosopher A. C. Grayling published a book, &quot;Against All Gods: Six Polemics on Religion and an Essay on Kindness&quot;.

<doc id="385553" wikidata="Q1390054" url="?curid=385553" title="Michael McClure">
<text>Michael McClure (October 20, 1932 – May 4, 2020) was an American poet, playwright, songwriter, and novelist. After moving to San Francisco as a young man, he found fame as one of the five poets (including Allen Ginsberg) who read at the famous San Francisco Six Gallery reading in 1955, which was rendered in barely fictionalized terms in Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot;. He soon became a key member of the Beat Generation and was immortalized as Pat McLear in Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;Big Sur&quot;.

==Career overview==
Educated at the Municipal University of Wichita (1951–1953), the University of Arizona (1953–1954) and San Francisco State College (B.A., 1955), McClure&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;Passage&quot;, was published in 1956 by small press publisher Jonathan Williams. Stan Brakhage, a friend of McClure, stated in the &quot;Chicago Review&quot; that:
McClure always, and more and more as he grows older, gives his reader access to the verbal impulses of his whole body&#x27;s thought (as distinct from simply and only brain-think, as it is with most who write). He invents a form for the cellular messages of his, a form which will feel as if it were organic on the page; and he sticks with it across his life ...
McClure published eight books of plays and four collections of essays, including essays on Bob Dylan and the environment. His fourteen books of poetry include &quot;Jaguar Skies&quot;, &quot;Dark Brown&quot;, &quot;Huge Dreams&quot;, &quot;Rebel Lions&quot;, &quot;Rain Mirror&quot; and &quot;Plum Stones&quot;. McClure famously read selections of his &quot;Ghost Tantra&quot; poetry series to the caged lions in the San Francisco Zoo. His work as a novelist includes the autobiographical &quot;The Mad Cub&quot; and &quot;The Adept&quot;.

On January 14, 1967, McClure read at the Human Be-In event in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and later became an important member of the 1960s hippie counterculture. Barry Miles referred to him as &quot;the prince of the San Francisco scene&quot;.

McClure later courted controversy as a playwright with his play &quot;The Beard&quot;. The play tells of a fictional encounter between Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow and is a theatrical exploration of his &quot;Meat Politics&quot; theory, in which all human beings are &quot;bags of meat&quot;.

McClure&#x27;s other plays include &quot;Josephine The Mouse Singer&quot; and &quot;VKTMS&quot;. He had an eleven-year run as playwright-in-residence with San Francisco&#x27;s Magic Theatre where his operetta &quot;Minnie Mouse and the Tap-Dancing Buddha&quot; had an extended run. He made two television documentaries – &quot;The Maze&quot; and &quot;September Blackberries&quot; – and was featured in several films, including Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; (1978), where he recites from &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;; Norman Mailer&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Law&quot; (1968); and, most prominently, Peter Fonda&#x27;s &quot;The Hired Hand&quot; (1971).

McClure was a close friend of the Doors&#x27; lead singer Jim Morrison and is generally acknowledged as having been responsible for promoting Morrison as a poet. McClure performed spoken word poetry concerts with Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek until the latter&#x27;s death in 2013; several albums of their work have been released. McClure also contributed the afterword to &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot;, Jerry Hopkins&#x27;s and Danny Sugerman&#x27;s seminal Doors biography. McClure also released albums of his work with minimalist composer Terry Riley. McClure&#x27;s songs include &quot;Mercedes Benz&quot;, popularized by Janis Joplin, and new songs which were performed by Riders on the Storm, a band that consisted of Manzarek and Doors guitarist Robbie Krieger.

McClure&#x27;s journalism has been featured in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. He received numerous awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, an Obie Award for Best Play, an NEA grant, the Alfred Jarry Award and a Rockefeller grant for playwriting. In addition, he was inducted into the San Francisco State University Alumni Hall of Fame in 2014. McClure remained active as a poet, essayist and playwright until his death and lived with his second wife, Amy, in the San Francisco Bay Area. He had one daughter from his first marriage to Joanna McClure.

&quot;The Beard&quot; is a notably controversial modern play that explores the nature of seduction and attraction, portraying an explosive confrontation between two legendary figures: Jean Harlow, the platinum blonde movie star, and Billy the Kid, the baby-faced outlaw with a hair trigger. They are attracted to each other, but their egos get in the way. She mocks his masculinity, and he tells her she is envious of his beauty. This battle diminishes as they realize that since they are alone together, they are free to shed their burdening facades and give in to what they are truly feeling. The torrent of their unleashed passions leads to a final scene of great controversy, as the play comes to a climax with an act of explicit sexual intimacy between the cowboy and the starlet.

McClure said that he was inspired to write the play by a vision that came to him of a poster advertising a boxing match between Jean Harlow and Billy the Kid. Before he began to write, he went to the printer that created boxing posters in San Francisco and had the poster of his vision printed up. Then, he said, &quot;I put the poster up on fences, windows, and in liquor stores where boxing posters would be, and put one up behind my head in the room I worked in at the time, which overlooked the bridge and the ocean. I could feel the presence of Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow broadcasting from the beautiful poster to the back of my head out towards the ocean. They began enacting the play and I began typing it up. They&#x27;d say a few pages, I just typed it. I thought it was a nature poem about mammal sexuality and mammal love. It could have been a tantric ritual.&quot;

McClure happened to meet British playwright, Harold Pinter, who then gave words of support to the play, which helped it become noticed and gave courage to those who staged its first production in San Francisco in 1965.

It debuted at the Actor&#x27;s Workshop Theatre in San Francisco on the December 18, 1965. A second performance followed at Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore Auditorium on the July 24, 1966. With the Fillmore&#x27;s high profile, the play attracted an audience of 700. After success at the Fillmore, the following month the play opened at The Committee, a theatre nightclub in the North Beach area of the city, where it was hoped it would enjoy a lengthy run.

Now aware of the play&#x27;s controversial elements, the San Francisco Police Department secretly tape-recorded the first two performances and secretly filmed the third performance. Having failed in their attempts to censor Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot;, the performances of Lenny Bruce and the San Francisco Mime Troupe, the police department was intent on succeeding this time.

At the end of that third performance on August 8, 1966—only the fifth time the play had been performed in public—the San Francisco Police Department raided the venue and arrested actors Billie Dixon (Jean) and Richard Bright (Billy). Under &quot;Penal Code Section 647(a)&quot; the pair were initially charged with &quot;obscenity&quot;, then &quot;conspiracy to commit a felony&quot; and ultimately with &quot;lewd or dissolute conduct in a public place&quot;.

The American Civil Liberties Union took the case and represented the actors. Twelve days after the arrests, the play was performed at The Florence Schwimley Little Theatre, in Berkeley. The audience included more than a hundred ACLU-invited expert witnesses, including political activists, academics, writers and even members of the clergy. Seven members of the Berkeley Police Department and the District Attorney&#x27;s office were also present. Five days later, the city of Berkeley brought its own charges of &quot;lewd or dissolute conduct&quot; against the play. It became a theatrical &quot;cause célèbre&quot;, until finally, after months of legal deliberation, Judge Joseph Karesh of the San Francisco Superior Court ruled that while the play did contain material of a troublesome nature, it was not appropriate to prosecute such work under the law. All the charges were dropped and the subsequent appeal lost.

Unable to perform in the San Francisco area, the play moved to Los Angeles, where the play&#x27;s attempt at a run was disrupted by the arrest of both Dixon and Bright at curtain down of fourteen consecutive performances. McClure recalled, &quot;The actor and the actress actually got two standing ovations, one at the end of the play and the second when the police hauled them out of the door and into the waiting wagon and took them off to book them.&quot;

&quot;The Beard&quot; eventually transferred to New York where at the 1967–1968 Obie Theatre Awards, it won Best Director and Best Actress. It has since played successfully all over the world and is a favorite with American university drama groups. The play has enjoyed particular success in London, having been produced there twice. In 1968, actor Rip Torn directed a notable production at The Royal Court Theatre and it has most recently been revived at a smaller venue, the Old Red Lion Theatre in 2006 under the direction of Nic Saunders with new music by Terry Riley. The play is currently out of print in both the US and UK. Saunders would collaborate with McClure a second time in 2008 on the award-winning short film &quot;Curses and Sermons&quot;, which would mark the first time McClure had authorized a filmed adaptation of one of his poems.

==California College of Arts and Crafts==

<text>The Bias Against Guns: Why Almost Everything You&#x27;ve Heard About Gun Control Is Wrong is a book by John Lott, following up on his controversial &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot;. It is intended to reach a broader audience than its highly technical predecessor. Lott explores what he sees as misconceptions about gun ownership, including the practice of carrying concealed weapons.

== Main topics ==

&quot;The Bias Against Guns&quot; has two parts. The first explains what Lott believes is the source of false information about gun ownership. The second examines the issues regarding gun ownership, paying specific attention to topics that often arise in debates over gun politics.

== Reception ==
Lott&#x27;s book has been well received by those in the pro-gun lobby and amongst conservatives more generally. Two reviewers on the website National Rifle Association&#x27;s Institute for Legal Action describe how Lott&#x27;s book:

Lott discussed the book in an April 2004 event held by the Frontiers of Freedom Institute, which was broadcast on C-SPAN.

The book has been criticized by the some members of scientific community. John V. Pepper, Professor of Economics at the University of Virginia, wrote that &quot;Lott distorts anecdotal evidence about biases, misrepresents the relevant empirical literature, and presents evidence that cannot be used to draw credible conclusions about the effects of gun laws on crime.&quot; Similarly, David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, concludes that &quot;Much that Lott writes is either wrong or misleading.&quot;

<text>The Garden State Bowl was an annual post-season college football bowl game played at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, from 1978 until 1981. Freezing temperatures each year at the game, together with a lack of successful local college teams, contributed to its rapid demise.

==Game results==

==Broadcasters==
===Television===

==Effects==
After the demise of the Garden State Bowl following the 1981 game, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which operated and scheduled events at Giants Stadium, decided to host a game in the beginning of the season, rather than the end. This led to the formation of the Kickoff Classic, which was held either the last week of August or the first week of September every year for 20 seasons.

<text>Agostino Agazzari (2 December 1578 – 10 April 1640) was an Italian composer and music theorist.

==Life==
Agazzari was born in Siena to an aristocratic family. After working in Rome, as a teacher at the Roman College, he returned to Siena in 1607, becoming first organist and later choirmaster of the cathedral there. He was a close friend of Lodovico Grossi da Viadana, the early innovator of the basso continuo.

Agazzari wrote several books of sacred music, madrigals and the pastoral drama &quot;Eumelio&quot; (1606). Stylistically, &quot;Eumelio&quot; is similar to the famous composition by Cavalieri, &quot;Rappresentatione di Anima, e di Corpo&quot; of 1600, a work of singular significance in the development of the oratorio. In the preface to the drama he mentions that he was asked to set the text to music only one month before the performance; he composed the music in two weeks, and copied the parts and rehearsed it in the remaining two weeks, a feat which would be impressive even in the modern age.

Agazzari is best known, however, for &quot;Del sonare sopra il basso&quot; (1607), one of the earliest and most important works on basso continuo. This treatise was immensely important in the diffusion of the technique throughout Europe: for example, Michael Praetorius used large portions of it in his &quot;Syntagma musicum&quot; in Germany in 1618-1619. As was true with many late Renaissance and early Baroque theoretical treatises, it described a practice which was already occurring. In large part it was based on a study of his friend Viadana&#x27;s &quot;Cento concerti ecclesiastici&quot; (published in Venice in 1602), the first collection of sacred music to use the basso continuo.

Most of his compositions are sacred music, of which motets of the early Baroque variety (for two or three voices with instruments) predominate. All of the motets are accompanied by basso continuo, with organ providing the sustaining line. His madrigals, on the other hand, are &quot;a cappella&quot;, in the late Renaissance style, so Agazzari simultaneously showed extreme progressive tendencies as well as some more conservative ones: unusually, his progressive music was sacred, and his conservative was secular, a situation almost unique among composers of the early Baroque.

He died in Siena.

<doc id="385572" wikidata="Q5587800" url="?curid=385572" title="Gotham Bowl">
<text>The Gotham Bowl was a post-season college football bowl game that was played in New York City, in 1961 and 1962. The game was initially created as a fund-raising attempt for the March of Dimes.

The game was not a success financially: the two games that were played both lost money as few fans were willing to sit through the frigid December New York weather. Additionally, as it was essentially a charity game, it had little financial capital on which it could survive.

==Game results==

===1960===
In what was supposed to be the game&#x27;s inaugural year, the bowl hoped to invite Syracuse, but no invitation was extended when Syracuse announced immediately after its season ended that it would not accept any postseason offers. Organizers then invited Air Force, who insisted on playing Army since neither service academy played each other in the regular season; this plan fell through as well after Army rejected it. The bowl eventually extended an offer to Oregon State. Holy Cross and Colorado turned down invitations after bowl officials mishandled the invitation process, leaving Oregon State with no opponent and forcing the bowl to postpone for another year.

===1961===

The following year, the Gotham Bowl managed to find two teams to play, Baylor and Utah State, for the game at the Polo Grounds. Baylor won 24–9 in front of a sparse crowd of 15,123. (It was the penultimate college football game played at the Polo Grounds; Army defeated Syracuse 9–2 in front of 29,500 on September 29, 1962.)

===1962===
The 1962 edition of the Gotham Bowl, played in Yankee Stadium, was particularly tormented with poor planning and bad luck. The Miami Hurricanes (with a 7–3 record) were invited, but no opponent could be found. Finally, on December 4, 1962, just eleven days before the game, the Gotham Bowl invited Nebraska, which had just finished an 8–2 season under first-year head coach Bob Devaney. However, the day before the contest, the pilot of the Cornhuskers&#x27; team plane refused to leave the Lincoln airport until the bowl&#x27;s check for expenditures cleared, which it did. (Miami made a similar demand and received their $30,000 expense check up front.)

In addition, the 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike began on December 8 and showed little sign of resolution, all but assuring that the Gotham Bowl would receive virtually no coverage in its own city. The contest was, however, aired on national television by ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports.

The weather did not cooperate, either. A damp, day limited the official attendance to just 6,166 (plus 5,000 tickets given away). Perhaps a few thousand stalwarts were actually in the stands at kickoff.

The game itself was a thriller: Nebraska edged Miami 36–34, despite an MVP performance by Miami (and future professional) quarterback George Mira, who passed for 321 yards and a pair of touchdowns. It was the Cornhuskers&#x27; first trip to the Big Apple in four decades, after beating Rutgers at the Polo Grounds 28–0 in 1920. Nebraska has not played a game in New York City proper since, although they have played in suburban New Jersey in the now-defunct Kickoff Classic (in 1983, 1988 and 1994) and in Big Ten Conference games at Rutgers (in 2015 and 2020). For the Hurricanes, it was only their second trip to New York, having lost to Fordham at the Polo Grounds in 1953; they would not return to NYC until 2018, when they lost to Wisconsin in the Pinstripe Bowl.

The poor attendance ensured the 1962 Gotham Bowl would be the last one played.

<doc id="385576" wikidata="Q1015639" url="?curid=385576" title="Prince Rupert, British Columbia">
<text>Prince Rupert is a port city in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Its location is on Kaien Island near the Alaskan panhandle. It is the land, air, and water transportation hub of British Columbia&#x27;s North Coast, and has a population of 12,300 people as of 2021.

==History==
Coast Tsimshian (Ts&#x27;msyen) occupation of the Prince Rupert Harbour area spans at least 5,000 years. About 1500 B.C. there was a significant population increase, associated with larger villages and house construction. The early 1830s saw a loss of Coast Tsimshian (Ts&#x27;msyen) influence in the Prince Rupert Harbour area.

===Founding===

Prince Rupert replaced Port Simpson as the choice for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP) western terminus. It also replaced Port Essington, away on the southern bank of the Skeena River, as the business centre for the North Coast.

The GTP purchased the First Nations reserve, and received a grant from the BC government. A post office was established on November 23, 1906. Surveys and clearing, that commenced in that year, preceded the laying out of the town site. A $200,000 provincial grant financed plank sidewalks, roads, sewers and water mains. Kaien Island, which comprised damp muskeg overlaying solid bedrock, proved expensive both for developing the land for railway and town use.

By 1909, the town possessed four grocery, two hardware, two men&#x27;s clothing, a furniture, and several fruit and cigar stores, a wholesale drygoods outlet, a wholesale/retail butcher, two banks, the GTP Hotel and annex, and numerous lodging houses and restaurants. The first lot sales that year created a bidding war.

Prince Rupert was incorporated on March 10, 1910. Although he never visited Canada, it was named after Prince Rupert of the Rhine, the first Governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, as the result of a nationwide competition held by the Grand Trunk Railway, the prize for which was $250.

With the collapse of the real estate boom in 1912, and World War I, much of the company&#x27;s land remained unsold. The GTP also planned a large hotel, the Château Prince Rupert, connected to a railway station and passenger ship pier, all of which went unbuilt. Charles Melville Hays, president of the GTP, whose business plan made little sense, was primarily responsible for the bankruptcy of the company, and the establishment of a town that would take decades to achieve even a small fraction of the promises touted. Mount Hays, the larger of two mountains on Kaien Island, is named in his honour, as is a local high school, Charles Hays Secondary School. The Prince Rupert station, a listed historic place, replaced a temporary building in 1922.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Local politicians used the promise of a highway connected to the mainland as an incentive, and the city grew over the next several decades. US troops finally completed the road between Prince Rupert and Terrace during World War II to help move thousands of allied troops to the Aleutian Islands and the Pacific. Several forts were built to protect the city at Barrett Point and Fredrick Point. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Canadian government planned to level off Mount Hays, the largest mountain to the southeast of the city, to allow for a potential airstrip due to its tactical location and advantage.
After World War II, the fishing industry, particularly for salmon and halibut, and forestry became the city&#x27;s major industries. Prince Rupert was considered the halibut capital of the world from the opening of the Canadian Fish &amp; Cold Storage plant in 1912 until the early 1980s. A long-standing dispute over fishing rights in the Dixon Entrance to the Hecate Strait between American and Canadian fisherman led to the formation of the 54-40 or Fight Society. The United States Coast Guard maintains a base in nearby Ketchikan, Alaska.

In 1946, the Government of Canada, through an order in council, granted the Department of National Defence the power to administer and maintain facilities to collect data for communications research. The Royal Canadian Navy was allotted forty positions, seven of which were in Prince Rupert. In either 1948 or 1949, Prince Rupert ceased operations, and the positions were relocated to RCAF Station Whitehorse, Yukon. The 1949 Queen Charlotte earthquake, with a surface wave magnitude of 8.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (&quot;severe&quot;), broke windows and swayed buildings on August 22.

In summer 1958, Prince Rupert endured a riot over racial discrimination. Ongoing discontent with heavy-handed police practices towards Aboriginals escalated to rioting during BC centennial celebrations following the arrest of an Aboriginal couple. As many as 1,000 people (one-tenth of the city&#x27;s population at the time) began smashing windows and skirmishing with police. The Riot Act was read for only the second time since Confederation.

Over the years, hundreds of students were said to have largely paid their way through school by working in the lucrative fishing industry. Construction of a pulp mill began in 1947 and it was operating by 1951. In 1958, Indo-Canadian industrialist Sohen Singh Gill established Prince Rupert Sawmills at the location of the old dry dock on Prince Rupert&#x27;s waterfront. In the 1960s, the majority of the town&#x27;s workforce was employed either in the fishery or at Gill&#x27;s sawmill. The construction of coal and grain shipping terminals followed. From the 1960s into the 1980s, the city constructed many improvements, including a civic centre, swimming pool, public library, golf course and performing arts centre (recently renamed &quot;The Lester Centre of the Arts&quot;). These developments marked the town&#x27;s changes from a fishing and mill town into a small city.

In the 1990s, both the fishing and forestry industries suffered a significant downturn. In July 1997, Canadian fishermen blockaded the Alaska Marine Highway ferry M/V &quot;Malaspina&quot;, keeping it in the port as a protest in the salmon fishing rights dispute between Alaska and British Columbia. The forest industry declined when a softwood lumber dispute arose between Canada and the USA. After the pulp mill closed, many people were unemployed, and much modern machinery was left unused. After reaching a peak of about 18,000 in the early 1990s, Prince Rupert&#x27;s population began to decline, as people left in search of work.

The years from 1996 to 2004 were difficult for Prince Rupert, with closure of the pulp mill, the burning down of a fish plant and a significant population decline. 2005 may be viewed as a critical turning point: the announcement of the construction of a container port in April 2005, combined with new ownership of the pulp mill, the opening in 2004 of a new cruise ship dock, the resurgence of coal and grain shipping, and the prospects of increased heavy industry and tourism may foretell a bright future for the area. The port is becoming an important trans-Pacific hub.

==Geography==
Prince Rupert is on Kaien Island (approximately northwest of Vancouver), just north of the mouth of Skeena River, and linked by a short bridge to the mainland. The city is along the island&#x27;s northwestern shore, fronting on Prince Rupert Harbour. It lies at similar latitudes to Cumbria and the city of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in the northeast of England.

At the secondary western terminus of Trans-Canada Highway 16 (the Yellowhead Highway), Prince Rupert is approximately 16 km west of Port Edward, 144 km west of Terrace, and 715 km west of Prince George.

===Climate===
Prince Rupert has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dolk&quot;) and is also located in a temperate rainforest. Prince Rupert is known as &quot;The City of Rainbows&quot;, as it is Canada&#x27;s wettest city, with of annual precipitation on average, of which is rain. In addition, 240 days per year receive at least some measurable precipitation, and there are only 1230 hours of sunshine per year, so it is regarded as the municipality in Canada that receives the lowest amount of sunshine annually. Tourist brochures boast about Prince Rupert&#x27;s &quot;100 days of sunshine&quot;. However, Stewart, British Columbia, receives even less sunshine, at 985 sunshine hours per year.

Out of Canada&#x27;s 100 largest cities, Prince Rupert has the coolest summer, with an average high of . Winters in Prince Rupert are mild by Canadian standards, with the average afternoon temperature in December, January and February being , which is the tenth warmest in Canada, surpassed only by other British Columbia cities.

Summers are mild and comparatively less rainy, with an August daily mean of . Spring and autumn are not particularly well-defined; rainfall nevertheless peaks in the autumn months. Winters are chilly and damp, but warmer than most locations at a similar latitude, due to Pacific moderation: The January daily mean is , although frosts and blasts of cold Arctic air from the northeast are not uncommon.

Snow amounts are moderate for Canadian standards, averaging and occurring mostly from December to March. Snowfall in Prince Rupert is rare and the snow normally melts within a few days, although individual snowstorms may bring copious amounts of snow. Wind speeds are relatively strong, with prevailing winds blowing from the southeast.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Prince Rupert was on 6 June 1958. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 4 January 1965.

==Transport==

===Seaport===

A belief at the beginning of the 1900s that trade expansion was shifting from Atlantic to Pacific destinations, and the benefit of being closer to Asia than existing west coast ports, proved wishful. Reduced transit times to eastern North America and Europe did not outweigh the fact that rail transport has always been far more expensive than by sea. The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 exacerbated the problem.

During 1906–08, the federal government undertook a hydrographic survey of the Prince Rupert harbour and approaches, finding it free of rocks or obstructions, and sufficient depth for good anchorage. Furthermore, it offered an easy entrance, fine shelter, and ample space. By 1909, a 1,500-foot wharf had been constructed.

The port possesses the deepest ice-free natural harbour in North America, and the 3rd deepest natural harbour in the world. Situated at 54° North, the harbour is the northwesternmost port in North America linked to the continent&#x27;s railway network. The port is the first inbound and last outbound port of call for some cargo ships travelling between eastern Asia and western North America since it is the closest North American port to key Asian destinations. The CN Aquatrain barge carries rail cargo between Prince Rupert and Whittier, Alaska.

Passenger ferries operating from Prince Rupert include BC Ferries&#x27; service to the Haida Gwaii and to Port Hardy on Vancouver Island, and Alaska Marine Highway ferries to Ketchikan, Juneau and Sitka and many other ports along Alaska&#x27;s Inside Passage. The Prince Rupert Ferry Terminal is co-located with the Prince Rupert railway station, from which Via Rail offers a thrice-weekly Jasper – Prince Rupert train, connecting to Prince George and Jasper, and through a connection with &quot;The Canadian&quot;, to the rest of the continental passenger rail network.

The Prince Rupert Port Authority is responsible for the port&#x27;s operation.

Much of the harbour is formed by the shelter provided by Digby Island, which lies windward of the city and contains the Prince Rupert Airport. The city is on Kaien Island and the harbour also includes Tuck Inlet, Morse Basin, Wainwright Basin, and Porpoise Harbour, as well as part of the waters of Chatham Sound which takes in Ridley Island.

====Port facilities====


Prince Rupert is ideally located for a port, having the deepest natural harbour depths on the continent. The city&#x27;s port capacity is comparable with the Port of Vancouver&#x27;s. Unlike most west coast ports, there is little traffic congestion at Prince Rupert. Finally, the extremely mountainous nature and narrow channels of the surrounding area leaves Prince Rupert as the only suitable port location in the inland passage region.

The Prince Rupert Port Authority (PRPA) is a federally appointed agency which administers and operates various port properties on the harbour. Previously run by the National Harbours Board and subsequently the Prince Rupert Port Corporation, the PRPA is now a locally run organization.

PRPA port facilities include:

* Atlin Terminal
* Northlands Terminal
* Lightening Dock
* Ocean Dock
* Westview Dock
* Fairview Terminal
* Prince Rupert Grain
* Trigon Pacific Terminals (formerly Ridley Terminals)
* Sulphur Corporation

All PRPA facilities are serviced by CN Rail.

The Canadian Coast Guard maintains CCG Base Seal Cove on Prince Rupert Harbour where vessels are homeported for search and rescue and maintenance of aids to navigation throughout the north coast. CCG also bases helicopters at Prince Rupert for servicing remote locations with aids to navigation, as well as operating a Marine Communications Centre, covering a large Vessel Traffic Services zone from Port Hardy at the northern tip of Vancouver Island to the International Boundary north of Prince Rupert.

Both BC Ferries and the Alaska Marine Highway operate ferries which call at Prince Rupert, with destinations in the Alaska Panhandle, the Haida Gwaii, and isolated communities along the central coast to the south.

===Airport===
Prince Rupert Airport (YPR/CYPR) is on Digby Island. Its position is , and its elevation is ) above sea level. The airport consists of one runway, one passenger terminal, and two aircraft stands. Access to the airport is typically achieved by a bus connection that departs from downtown Prince Rupert (Highliner Hotel) and travels to Digby Island by ferry. The airport is served by Air Canada from Vancouver International Airport (YVR).

Prince Rupert is also served by the Prince Rupert/Seal Cove Water Aerodrome, a seaplane facility with regularly scheduled, as well as chartered, flights to nearby villages and remote locations.

===Railway===

CN Rail has a mainline that runs to Prince Rupert from Valemount, British Columbia. At Valemount, the Prince Rupert mainline joins the CN mainline from Vancouver. Freight traffic on the Prince Rupert mainline consists primarily of grain, coal, wood products, chemicals, and as of 2007, containers. As the renovations at the Port of Prince Rupert continue, traffic on CN will steadily rise in future years. Freight capacity was upgraded in 2024.

In addition, a three times weekly Jasper – Prince Rupert train operated by Via Rail connects Prince Rupert with Prince George and Jasper. Running during daylight hours to allow passengers to be able to see the scenery along the entire route; the service takes two days and requires an overnight hotel stay in Prince George. The route ends in Jasper and connects passengers with Via&#x27;s The Canadian, which runs between Toronto and Vancouver.

==Communications==
Telephone, mobile, and Internet service are provided by CityWest (formerly CityTel). CityWest is owned by the City of Prince Rupert. CityWest provides long-distance telephone service, as does Telus.

In September 2005, the city changed CityTel from a city department into an independent corporation named CityWest. The new corporation immediately purchased the local cable company, Monarch Cablesystems, expanding CityWest&#x27;s customer base to other northwest British Columbia communities.

Since January 2008, Rogers Communications has offered GSM and EDGE service in the area—the first real competition to CityWest&#x27;s virtual monopoly. Rogers offers local numbers based in Port Edward (prefix 600), which is in the local calling zone for the Prince Rupert area. The introduction of Rogers service forced Citywest to form a partnership with Bell Canada to bring digital services to Citywest Mobility, using CDMA.

In December 2013, CityWest and TELUS announced it was transitioning out of the cellular business over 2014 and would partner with TELUS to bring CityWest wireless customers onto TELUS&#x27; 4G wireless network.

==Tourist attractions==
Prince Rupert is a central point on the Inside Passage, a route of relatively sheltered waters running along the Pacific coast from Vancouver, British Columbia to Skagway, Alaska. Due to the Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886, many cruise ships visit during the summer &quot;en route&quot; between Alaska to the north and Seattle and the Lower 48 to the south.

Prince Rupert is also the starting point for many wildlife viewing trips, including whales, eagles, salmon and grizzly bears. The Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear sanctuary features one of the densest remaining populations in North America; tours can be arranged by water, air (using float planes) or land departing from Prince Rupert.

<text>Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica (born 227 BC; fl. 204171 BC) (Nasica meaning &quot;pointed nose&quot;) was a consul of ancient Rome in 191 BC. He was a son of Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus.

At the request of the Senate, he journeyed with the Roman matrons to receive the statue of Magna Mater in 204 when it arrived from Anatolia at Ostia. According to Livy and Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot; we are told that he was chosen for this duty because he was the best of the Roman community. He was later aedile in 197. As praetor in Hispania Ulterior (194), he defeated the Lusitanians at Ilipa, and as consul subjugated the Boii. He was not chosen as censor despite standing in both the elections of 189 and 184, a failure marking the decline of the influence of the Scipiones in Rome. He went on to help found Aquileia in 181, and appears in an inquiry of 171.

This Scipio Nasica was the father of the Scipio Nasica who opposed Cato the Censor for several years on the question of Carthage. Both father and son were distinguished jurists; the father was reportedly given a house in the center of Rome by the Senate to make his advice more accessible to the Senate and people of Rome.

He knew the epic poet Ennius as Cicero reports an anecdote on them.

<doc id="385594" wikidata="Q13802568" url="?curid=385594" title="The Story of Mankind">
<text>The Story of Mankind is a book written and illustrated by Dutch-American journalist, professor, and author Hendrik Willem van Loon. It was published in 1921. In 1922, it was awarded the Newbery Medal for an outstanding contribution to children&#x27;s literature. This was the first year the Newbery Medal was awarded.

Written for Van Loon&#x27;s children, &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot; tells in brief chapters the history of Western civilization, beginning with primitive man, covering the development of writing, art, and architecture, the rise of major religions, and the formation of the modern nation-state. Van Loon explains in the book how he selected what and what not to include by subjecting all materials to the question &quot;Did the person or event in question perform an act without which the entire history of civilization would have been different?&quot;.

Van Loon published an updated edition in 1926 which included an extra essay, &quot;After Seven Years&quot;, about the effects of World War I and another update in 1938 with a new epilogue. Since Van Loon&#x27;s death in 1944, extensive additions were included in &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot;, initially by van Loon&#x27;s son, Gerrit van Loon. The 2014 version () by Robert Sullivan covers events up to the early 2010s.

==Adaptation==
In 1957, a feature film with the same title was released, based on the book. It stars Ronald Colman and an all-star cast, featuring, among others, the Marx Brothers.

<doc id="385596" wikidata="Q936644" url="?curid=385596" title="Seabrook, Maryland">
<text>Seabrook is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States, located approximately east of Washington, D.C. Per the 2020 census, the population was 19,627. Prior to 2010, Seabrook was part of the Lanham-Seabrook census-designated place.

==Etymology==
Seabrook takes its name from Thomas Seabrook, who was a topographical engineer with the Pennsylvania Railroad. He originally built three cottages and a park with fenced-in tame deer in the area near the rail station in the early 1870s.

==History==
A school was built in Seabrook in 1895.

The community developed in direct relationship with the Washington Branch of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad. The railroad&#x27;s main branch into Washington opened in July 1872, with stations established at Glenn Dale, Seabrook, and Lanham, among others. Thomas Seabrook, an engineer for the railroad, purchased of land in 1871 around the location of a planned station for the purpose of creating a retreat community, and later that year the railroad chose to call the station &quot;Seabrook&#x27;s&quot;. By 1880, a station building and three Gothic cottages had been built, followed by commercial buildings and a schoolhouse. By 1914, the community remained small with just a few buildings located at the intersection of Seabrook Road with the railroad. By 1957, the community had grown to include approximately 185 houses along 10 streets. The streets were arranged in a grid pattern roughly parallel to the railroad line. The community extended from present-day Good Luck Road south to Annapolis Road.

Residential development continued on vacant lots within the community throughout the 20th century, while commercial development focused along the main roads. Commercial strip development is located along Annapolis Road and Lanham-Severn Road. The original railroad station and early commercial buildings are no longer extant, though the old schoolhouse and a few of the early dwellings survive.

Most of the more recently built Seabrook (some of which was originally called Seabrook Acres) is a development of red brick homes along the Lanham-Severn Road, now Maryland Route 564 in Maryland, approximately one half mile east of the Capital Beltway. Many of its homes were built in the 1950s to serve the needs of new employees at the newly established NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, which is located immediately to the north. Development of apartment complexes and other large structures has occurred during recent years of developer expansion. However, Seabrook remains a residential area with numerous single homes surrounded by green lawns shaded by century-old oak trees.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Seabrook census-designated place has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
Seabrook first appeared as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. Census formed from all of the deleted Goddard CDP, part of the deleted Lanham-Seabrook CDP, and part of the Glenn Dale CDP.

===2020 census===
==Businesses==
Seabrook has its own MARC commuter rail station (Seabrook Station). Seabrook residents are served by a large number of small businesses, including restaurants, fast foot eateries, banks, lawyer services, laundry services, veterinary services, car repair, and numerous other businesses which are located at the Seabrook Station. Seabrook shoppers also tend to shop at the supermarkets and stores at Glenn Dale, slightly to the east on Route 564, or drive east approximately to Bowie, with its large shopping complexes such as the Bowie Town Center.

==Lanham-Seabrook==

Lanham, Maryland, an older community, lies to the west on both sides of the Washington Beltway. Within the Lanham-Seabrook area, there is only one post office (20706), located a half mile east of Seabrook Station on route 564, which both towns must share. As a result, since the post office has been designated &quot;Lanham&quot;, all mail to both the Seabrook and Lanham area is town-designated as &quot;Lanham&quot; or &quot;Lanham-Seabrook&quot;.

==Government==
Prince George&#x27;s County Police Department District 2 Station in Brock Hall CDP, with a Bowie postal address, serves the community.

The U.S. Postal Service operates the Lanham Seabrook Post Office in Lanham CDP.

==Education==
Prince George&#x27;s County Public Schools serves Seabrook.

Zoned elementary schools serving the CDP include Robert Frost, Gaywood, Magnolia, and Catherine T. Reed.

Thomas Johnson Middle School serves most of Seabrook CDP while Greenbelt Middle School serves a portion.

DuVal High School serves most of Seabrook CDP while Eleanor Roosevelt High School serves a portion.

<text>The International Workers League (Fourth International) (, or LITci; , or LIT-QI), also known as IWLfi, is a Morenist Trotskyist international organisation.

==Overview==
The group&#x27;s origins lie in the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). Moreno&#x27;s supporters followed the American Socialist Workers Party in leaving the ICFI in 1963 to form the reunified Fourth International (USFI). In 1969, the USFI voted to support guerrilla war in Latin America. Moreno&#x27;s group opposed this. 

While critical of the Sandinistas, Moreno&#x27;s group sent a Simon Bolivar Brigade to Nicaragua to aid the Civil War, with the aim of building a revolutionary party there. This brigade was opposed by the reunified Fourth International because it operated outside the discipline of the FSLN; the only other Trotskyists to participate were Pierre Lamberts&#x27; Organising Committee for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International. Forty non-Nicaraguan members of the Brigade were expelled from the country by the FSLN. Almost immediately, Moreno&#x27;s and Lambert&#x27;s tendencies joined to form the Parity Committee for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International. However, Moreno&#x27;s supporters withdrew in 1981 complaining that Lambert had links to trade union bureaucrats, and in 1982 formed the &quot;International Workers League (Fourth International)&quot;. In addition to their former supporters, this also attracted groups in Peru and Venezuela which split from the Lambertist currents.

The group campaigned for the victory of Argentina in the Falklands War, for the non-payment of foreign debt, and for the &quot;defeat of imperialism in the Gulf War.&quot; In the mid-1990s, it helped launch Workers&#x27; Aid to Bosnia and began working with the Workers International to Rebuild the Fourth International, although that group is now inactive.

Disagreements following the death of Moreno led several sections to leave the international, while others split. Those who left founded the International Centre of Orthodox Trotskyism (CITO in Spanish). The majority of this group rejoined the International Workers League in 2005, the minority forming the International Socialist League.

In 2021 the Chilean section of the IWLfi elected a member to the constitutional convention. María Rivera was elected in district 8 (Santiago West) as part of The List of the People. 

The LITci publishes the bulletin &quot;International Courier&quot; (&quot;Correo Internacional&quot;) and the journal &quot;Marxism Alive&quot; (&quot;Marxismo Vivo&quot; or &quot;Le Marxisme Vivant&quot;), both in various languages, principally Spanish.

<text>Johann Wilhelm &quot;Rukeli&quot;Trollmann (27 December 1907 – April 1944) was a German Sinti boxer.

== Early life ==
Trollmann was born in , a village part of Gifhorn, into a poor Protestant family. His father, Wilhelm &quot;Schnipplo&quot; Trollmann (1867–1933), was an ethnic German umbrella maker and part-time musician, while his mother, Friederike &quot;Pessy&quot; Weiss (1874–1946), was of Sinti origin. He had eight siblings: his three sisters Maria, Anna, and Wilhelmine, and five brothers Wilhelm, Ferdinand, Julius, Albert, and Heinrich. The family moved to Hanover, settling in the borough Ricklingen, in the early 1910s. Trollmann attended the local &quot;Volksschule&quot; until third grade.

Trollmann picked up boxing when he was a child and had his first amateur match at eight years old. He was called &quot;Rukeli&quot; by other Sinti, derived from the Romani word for tree (&quot;ruk&quot;), for his upright stance. Trollmann&#x27;s youngest brothers, Albert (&quot;Benny&quot;) and Heinrich (&quot;Stabeli&quot;), also boxed in their private time.

Although the family had kept close ties to the Roma community, the Trollmanns were regarded as assimilated. Trollmann&#x27;s father had served in Braunschweig&#x27;s water police during World War I while the family of his mother had long abandoned their itinerant lifestyle.

== Career ==

=== Amateur boxing ===
Boxing as a sport had been severely limited during the German Empire, with outright bans in some regions. Training and professional matches became openly accessible in 1919 with the founding of the Weimar Republic. Trollmann entered the boxing scene in the early 1920s. He won the regional title of Hanover district&#x27;s boxing championship four times in a row and became a member of the BC Heros Eintracht in 1922, thus joining the &quot;Deutsche Reichsverband für Amateur-Boxen&quot; (DRfAB). Trollmann became famous in the mid-1920s for winning the North-German amateur boxing championship.

With the rising popularity of boxing, Trollmann entered officially held matches as a middleweight by 1924. His looks made him popular with the audience, earning him compliments by both women and men during matches and dedicated columns in newspapers in his hometown. He was well-received for his distinct boxing style, which was compared to dance for Trollmann&#x27;s quick and agile moves. Trollmann&#x27;s critics primarily focused on his Romani heritage and mocked his technique as &quot;un-German&quot;, with some newspapers derisively nicknaming him &quot;the Dancing Gypsy&quot; (&quot;der tanzende Zigeuner&quot;) or just &quot;Gipsy/Gibsy&quot;.

Trollmann sought to join the German national boxing team for the 1928 Summer Olympics, but was barred by officials, officially for &quot;inedequate performance&quot;. For the middleweight class, the committee instead selected Walter Cunow, who had been previously defeated by Trollmann several times; Cunow himself would be replaced by Albert Leidmann. It has since been suspected that Trollmann&#x27;s rejection was related to the Weimar government&#x27;s unwillingness to be represented by a Sinto at the event.

=== Professional boxing ===
In June 1929, Trollmann left the BC Heros Eintracht and joined BC Sparta Linden, primarily made up of athletes with working class backgrounds, to focus on national competitions in professional sports. From then, he lived primarily in Berlin, being coached by Ernst Zirzow. Travelling throughout Germany, Trollmann fought against opponents, both German and foreign, in the welterweight to heavyweight classes.

==== Interference by the Nazi government ====
Following Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in January 1933, the Nazi government officially renamed boxing to &quot;German fistfighting&quot; (&quot;Deutscher Faustkampf&quot;) and declared the sport as an integral part of the effort to create a &quot;defensible &quot;Volkskörper&quot;&quot;. The following month, DRfAB was restructured into &quot;Deutscher Amateur-Boxverband&quot; (DABV), part of the newly established centralised boxing association &quot;Verband Deutscher Faustkämpfer&quot;, under chairman Georg Radamm, a long-time member of the Nazi Party. The change led to informal discrimination against athletes with non-German or mixed ethnic backgrounds. Trollmann&#x27;s family had been largely conservative, with Trollmann&#x27;s eldest brother Wilhelm (&quot;Carlo&quot;) joining the SA in 1933, but he was ousted the same year for being Roma.

On 9 June 1933, Trollmann fought for the German light-heavyweight title against Adolf Witt, in a highly publicised match attended by Nazi officials, including VDF chairman Radamm. Aware that Trollmann was likely to win, which would call the Nazi government&#x27;s professed superiority of the German &quot;Aryans&quot; into question, Radamm had instructed the jury to judge &quot;no result&quot; and although Trollmann clearly led by points over the course of six rounds, the jury obeyed Radamm&#x27;s instructions. The audience rebelled and after thirty minutes, the jury acknowledged Trollmann as the victor. 

However, six days later he was stripped of the title, with a VDF letter stating that both fighters had &quot;performed inadequately&quot; and that Trollmann had shown &quot;unsportsmanlike behaviour&quot; by crying tears of joy while receiving the trophy belt. A new fight was scheduled for 21 July, with runner-up , a heavyweight, as Trollmann&#x27;s opponent. Trollmann was threatened that he had to change his &quot;dancing&quot; style or lose his licence. Trollmann arrived the day of the match with his hair dyed blond and his face whitened with flour, the caricature of an Aryan. He took the blows of his opponent as he was asked for five rounds before he collapsed. The defeat signalled his permanent expulsion from professional boxing, with his licence being revoked in the following autumn, but this did nothing to dismantle his popular image. To avoid further issues with Nazi officials, Trollmann briefly went into hiding in the region around Teutoburg Forest.

Between 1933 and 1935, Trollmann continued to earn a living as a boxer at carnivals and other small-scale events. He resided in Berlin-Charlottenburg with his girlfriend Olga Frieda Bilda (1915 – after 1975), having a daughter, Rita, in March 1935. The couple married on 1 June 1935.

== Detainment ==
In July 1935, Trollmann was detained at following a forced sterilisation order. With the introduction of the Nuremberg Laws in September 1935, the persecution of Sinti and Roma in Germany dramatically increased. Trollmann was labelled &quot;feeble-minded since birth&quot; and forcibly sterilised 23 December 1935, as part of Nazi eugenics efforts targeting ethnic minorities. In September 1938, Trollmann divorced from his wife in hopes of covering for his daughter who, under the Nuremberg Laws, would be judged a &quot;Mischling&quot; for being half-Sintiza.

By 1938, Trollmann had been transferred to Hannover-Ahlem subcamp, but was released the same year. In November 1939 he was drafted into the Wehrmacht as an infantryman. He was stationed in occupied France, Belgium, and Poland, where he was wounded in June 1941 during the early stages of Operation Barbarossa, being returned to Germany as a result; he was officially discharged in early 1942, when Sinti and Roma were banned from serving in the military.

The Gestapo arrested Trollmann in June 1942 while in Hanover. He was tortured during custody at the city&#x27;s branch office of the and in October of the same year, he was interned Neuengamme concentration camp in Hamburg. He tried to keep a low profile, but was recognized by &quot;Schutzhaftlagerführer&quot; , who had been a boxing official before the war. He used Trollmann as a trainer for his troops during the nights in exchange for a slice of buttered bread for each time Trollmann was knocked out. Having already lost 30 kg before arriving in Neuengamme, the spars were treated as leisure by the SS guards and regularly devolved into beatdowns, causing Trollmann&#x27;s health to deteriorate further. After three months, the prisoners committee decided to act and faked Trollmann&#x27;s death on 9 February 1943, being listed in the camp book as having died of pneumonia compounded by vascular disease. His family received an urn, which was buried at Anger Cemetery in Hanover. In reality, the committee had managed to get him transferred to the Wittenberge satellite camp under an assumed identity.

=== Death ===
By spring 1944, the former star was again recognised and the camp elders organized a fight between him and Emil Cornelius, a former criminal and hated &quot;Heu&quot; commando Kapo (a prisoner given privileges for taking on responsibilities in the camp, often a convict working for a reduced sentence or parole). Trollmann won, Cornelius sought revenge for his humiliation and forced Trollmann to work all day until he was exhausted, before attacking and killing him with a shovel. Trollmann was 36 years old. According to fellow Sinto internee Rudolf Landsberger, the SS covered up the death as an accident and buried Trollmann in a forest outside the town cemetery. 

Two of Trollmann&#x27;s brothers also died as a result of the Romani Holocaust: his youngest brother Heinrich, who had also been a communist, died in Auschwitz concentration camp in 1943, while another brother, Julius (&quot;Mauso&quot;), died in 1958 from long-term health effects of his imprisonment, having been rendered paraplegic from severe beatings at a hard labour camp.

==Rehabilitation and commemoration==
In 2003, the officially recognised Trollmann as the winner of the 1933 championship.

On 9 June 2010, the anniversary of his championship fight, the German artist collective Bewegung Nurr erected a temporary memorial &quot;9841&quot; in the Berlin Victoria Park to honour Trollmann. The memorial was also displayed the following year in Hannover and in Dresden in 2012 for six weeks. The title refers to Trollmann&#x27;s prison number.

In 2015, the Italian alternative rock band C.F.F. e il Nomade Venerabile released the song &quot;Come fiori&quot; dedicated to Trollmann. This song was the inspiration for the theathral show &quot;My Inv(f)erno... gypsy life&quot; which opened the X edition of the International TeatroLab Festival at the Tagliavini theatre in Novellara in March 2019.

In 2016, Dario Fo, recipient of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature, published the book &quot;Razza di zingaro&quot; based on Trollmann&#x27;s life.

In 2022, the German television series Babylon Berlin season four, a fictional version of Trollmann is portrayed by Hannes Wegener and is revealed to be the half-brother of one of the series&#x27; leads, Lotte Ritter. A fight takes place between Trollman and Willy Bolze, who in real life was Trollman&#x27;s first professional boxing opponent. The dates are different in the show with their fight taking place in 1931 instead of 1929.

<text>Josef Lhévinne (13 December 18742 December 1944) was a Russian pianist and piano teacher. Lhévinne wrote a short book in 1924 that is considered a classic: &quot;Basic Principles in Pianoforte Playing&quot;. Asked how to say his name, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; it was &quot;lay-VEEN&quot;.

==Biography==
Joseph Arkadievich Levin (the name was altered in western Europe by a manager who thought &quot;Lhévinne&quot; more distinctive and less Jewish) was born into a Jewish family of musicians in Oryol south of Moscow. He studied at the Imperial Conservatory in Moscow under Vasily Safonov. He made his public debut at the age of 14 with Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Emperor Concerto&quot; in a performance conducted by his musical hero Anton Rubinstein. He graduated at the top of a class that included both Sergei Rachmaninoff and Alexander Scriabin, winning the gold medal for piano in 1892. In 1895 Levin won the Second International Anton Rubinstein Competition held in Berlin, emerging as the favoured pianist in a group of thirty-three candidates with his performance of Rubinstein&#x27;s &quot;Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat major.&quot;

In 1898, Levin married Rosina Bessie, a fellow Moscow Conservatory student, a pianist and winner of the gold medal for piano in her year. The two began to give concerts together, a practice that lasted until his death. Faced with antisemitism and the political turbulence of the Russian Revolution, they moved to Berlin in 1907. There Lhévinne gained a reputation as one of the leading virtuosi and teachers of his day. They were declared enemy aliens at the outbreak of World War I and became trapped there. They had lost what money they had saved in Russian banks in the 1917 Revolution and were unable to perform in concerts due to the war. They endured years of hardship, surviving on the poor income from a handful of students.

After the war they were at last free to leave Germany, and in 1919 emigrated to New York City in the United States. Lhévinne continued his concert career and also taught piano at the Juilliard School. Regarded as one of the supreme technicians of his day by virtually all of his more famous contemporaries (even Vladimir Horowitz admired his pianistic command), he never achieved their level of success with the public. He may have made his excellence look and sound too easy, but he also enjoyed teaching more than performing. He settled into a life of concert tours and teaching. Lhévinne spent time each summer starting in 1922, at Bonnie Oaks, relaxing from public life and sometimes teaching young musicians. He died suddenly in New York, from a heart attack in 1944 a few days short of his 70th birthday.

==Recordings==
Lhévinne made only a few recordings, some of which are considered to be examples of perfect technique and musical elegance. The discs of the Chopin Études Op. 25, Nos. 6 &amp; 11 recorded for RCA Victor in 1935 and Schulz-Evler&#x27;s arrangement of Johann Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;Blue Danube Waltz&quot;, also for Victor in 1928, are legendary among pianists and connoisseurs. His piano roll of Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Papillons&quot; Op.2 and 1935 recording of Schumann&#x27;s Toccata Op.7 are considered some of the definitive performances of these works. In the words of Harold C. Schonberg: &quot;His tone was like the morning stars singing together, his technique was flawless even if measured against the fingers of Hofmann and Rachmaninoff, and his musicianship was sensitive.&quot; Lhévinne made a number of piano rolls in the 1920s for Ampico, a collection of which were recorded and released on the Argo label in 1966. Lhévinne also recorded three times for the Welte-Mignon reproducing piano.
He recorded Mozart&#x27;s Sonata for Two Pianos in D major K.448, with his wife Rosina for RCA Victor in 1935.

<doc id="385611" wikidata="Q522561" url="?curid=385611" title="The Ghost of Tom Joad">
<text>The Ghost of Tom Joad is the eleventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen, released on November 21, 1995, by Columbia Records. His second primarily acoustic album after &quot;Nebraska&quot; (1982), &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; reached the top ten in two countries, and the top twenty in five more, including No. 11 in the United States. It was his first studio album to fail to reach the top ten in the US in over two decades. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album.

== Composition ==
Springsteen wrote and recorded the album between March and September, 1995, at Thrill Hill West, his home studio in Los Angeles, California. Following that year&#x27;s studio reunion with the E Street Band and the release of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, Springsteen&#x27;s writing activity had increased significantly, resulting in this album, which consists of seven solo tracks and five band tracks.

Most tracks are backed by acoustic guitar work and the lyrics are generally a somber reflection of life in the mid-1990s in America and Mexico. The character of Tom Joad entered the American consciousness in John Steinbeck’s 1939 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, set against the economic hardships of the Great Depression. This spawned a film version starring Henry Fonda, which in turn inspired folk singer Woody Guthrie to pen &quot;The Ballad of Tom Joad&quot;.

Springsteen was also influenced by Dale Maharidge and Michael Williamson&#x27;s 1985 study of homelessness, &quot;Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass&quot;. The album&#x27;s release was followed by Springsteen&#x27;s solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, which ran from 1995 to 1997 and took place in mostly small venues.

==Release==
&quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; debuted at number eleven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with 107,000 copies sold in its first week. However, it broke a string of eight consecutive Top 5 studio albums in the United States for Springsteen. The album won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; received mostly favorable reviews, but also drew some sharp criticism. Mikal Gilmore of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;Springsteen&#x27;s best album in ten years,&quot; and considered it &quot;among the bravest work that anyone has given us this decade.&quot; He characterised it as Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;first overtly social statement since Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, and as having &quot;an obvious kinship with Spingsteen’s 1982 masterwork, &quot;Nebraska&quot;&quot;, the artist&#x27;s first acoustic album. Bill Wyman of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; expressed disappointment that &quot;Springsteen can be so literal that it&#x27;s hard to appreciate some of the record&#x27;s subtleties.&quot; He criticized the album for being &quot;stolidly depoppified to ensure that no one will derive actual pleasure from it.&quot;

In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for the year&#x27;s best albums, &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; placed at No. 8. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, simultaneously commended and criticized the album for being &quot;the most courageous and the most depressing of the year,&quot; pointing out that Springsteen was the only artist in the poll&#x27;s Top 40 &quot;to directly address the war on the poor (and, increasingly, what is called the middle class) that is now the political agenda of the industrialized world.&quot; He also took aim at what he said was Springsteen&#x27;s choice &quot;to muffle his songs, so that only those who really want to hear their despair will bother trying.&quot; Christgau lamented that the &quot;tunes, arrangements, and mysteriously praised &#x27;phrasing&#x27; aren’t just forbiddingly minimal — often they’re rather careless&quot;, and dubbed the album &quot;a bore&quot;.

<text>Walk Two Moons is a novel written by Sharon Creech, published by HarperCollins in 1994 and winner of the 1995 Newbery Medal. The novel was originally intended as a follow-up to Creech&#x27;s previous novel &quot;Absolutely Normal Chaos&quot;; but, the idea was changed after she began writing it. The book is often taught in elementary and middle schools across the world since the book is considered a classic example of what it means to judge, come to terms with death, and connecting with the people who surround us.

==Plot==
The novel is narrated by a 13-year-old girl named Salamanca Hiddle. She and her grandparents are from Bybanks, Kentucky, a fictional town based on Quincy, Kentucky, but they are currently renting a house in Euclid, Ohio. Sal&#x27;s mother has recently left Sal&#x27;s father, and Sal&#x27;s grandparents are taking her on a cross-country road trip to Lewiston, Idaho to see her mother. Sal loves nature and was very close to her mother before she left. On the trip, Sal entertains her grandparents by telling a story about her friend in Euclid, Ohio, Phoebe Winterbottom, whose mother suddenly disappeared and left their family too, and about Ben Finney, with whom Sal begins a romantic relationship. Throughout the book, as Sal&#x27;s story unfolds and their car travels west, she reveals more details about Phoebe, and why her story reminds Salamanca of her own. The more she tells her grandparents of Phoebe&#x27;s story, the more she feels like her story is less connected to Phoebe&#x27;s story. When Sal reaches the Missouri River, her grandmother, or referred to as Gram, is bitten by a Cottonmouth snake. Sal reaches Coeur d&#x27;Alene while Gram suffers a stroke and has to stay in a hospital. Gramps wants to stay with Gram, but having already taught Sal to drive on their farm, he gives her the car keys so she can reach her mother in Lewiston. After a tense four-hour drive along a winding road, Sal reaches Lewiston and visits her mother’s grave, finally coming to terms with her mother’s death in a bus crash over a year ago. When she gets back, it is revealed that Gram has died. At the end of the novel, Sal and her family move back to Bybanks and Sal mentions that their friends from Euclid are planning a visit.

==Themes==
The major themes in the story include the development of new relationships, dealing with grief, love, death, cultural identity, women&#x27;s roles as mothers and wives, the hardships of life, and the adventures of misunderstandings and coming to terms with reality. Creech drew on her background for many of the book&#x27;s themes and images, including Sal&#x27;s love of nature, her relationship with her mother, and the road trip to Idaho that frames the narrative. In an interview, Creech said that she found the aphorism that gives the book its title (&quot;Don&#x27;t judge a man until you&#x27;ve walked two moons in his moccasins&quot;) in a fortune cookie.

Sharon Creech is not indigenous, though she claims a vague, Native heritage. Indigenous Americans have expressed disappointment in the stereotypical and romanticized depiction of Native Americans in &quot;Walk Two Moons&quot;. Debbie Reese on Creech&#x27;s authority to write about Indigenous Americans: &quot;She&#x27;s an outsider to Native culture, trying to write a story as if she&#x27;s an insider. But her story is based on outsider&#x27;s writings, and outsider&#x27;s understandings, and it doesn&#x27;t work... the Indian content doesn&#x27;t really matter. It is simply a device, or, a decoration on a story about a young girl coming to terms with life and death.&quot;

Creech on her indigenous heritage and inspiration: &quot;My cousins maintain that one of our ancestors was an American Indian. As a child, I loved that notion, and often exaggerated it by telling people that I was a full-blooded Indian. I inhaled Indian myths...  I crept through the woods near our house, reenacting these myths, and wishing, wishing, for a pair of soft leather moccasins. (I admit --but without apology--that my view of American Indians was a romantic one.)&quot;

==Awards==
In 1995, &quot;Walk Two Moons&quot; won the Newbery Medal, the United Kingdom Reading Association Award, and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Book Award. In 1996, it received the WH Smith Mind-Boggling Book Award. In 1997, it also won the Literaturhaus Award, Austria, and the Young Adult Sequoyah Award.

<doc id="385615" wikidata="Q3501305" url="?curid=385615" title="Human Accomplishment">
<text>Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950 is a 2003 book by the political scientist Charles Murray. Surveying outstanding contributions to the Arts and Sciences from ancient times to the mid-twentieth century. Murray attempts to quantify and explain human accomplishment worldwide in the fields of Arts and Sciences by calculating the amount of space allocated to them in reference works, an area of research sometimes referred to as Historiometry.

==Index scores==
Murray ranks the leading 4,000 innovators in several fields of human accomplishment from 800 BC to 1950. In each field Murray identifies a number of sources (leading encyclopedias, histories and surveys) providing information about the leading figures in the field. The rankings are made from information in these sources. A raw score is determined based on how many sources mention and on how much space in each source is devoted to a person. Then these raw scores are normalized so that the lowest score is 1 and the highest score is 100. The resulting scores are called &quot;Index Scores&quot;.

== Analysis ==
According to Murray&#x27;s analysis, accomplishment has not been uniformly distributed. For example, in Italian Renaissance, accomplishment was concentrated in Florence and Venice. In the British Isles, around London, the industrial north, and lowland Scotland. Another result of his analysis was that most innovation has been accomplished by men, not women, and Europeans, not other ethnic and cultural groups.

There is a relationship between closeness to elite universities and human accomplishment (but not between non-elite universities and accomplishment). Furthermore, innovation is self-reinforcing: where there has been innovation, likely more will occur.

The book argued that streams of accomplishment are fostered by political regimes that give de facto freedom of action to their potential artists and scholars. This means freedom of expression and innovation. It does not necessarily mean democracy although totalitarianism suppressed innovation. War and civil unrest did not affect innovation.

Religious liberty increased innovation. Jews had &quot;sparse representation in European arts and sciences through the beginning of the 19C&quot;, but within a century Jews were disproportionately represented (except in astronomy). This coincided with the emancipation of Jews who earlier had been denied legal rights and access to universities and public office.

The highest scoring woman in a category was Murasaki Shikibu among Japanese literature. The highest in western literature was Virginia Woolf. The highest in science was Marie Curie.

== Decline ==
Murray argued that the world&#x27;s per capita progress in the Sciences and especially the Arts have declined, usually starting sometimes in the nineteenth century. In part this is due to diminishing returns. In the final chapters he abandons empirical analysis, writing &quot;I cannot supply Quantitative measures&quot;, and the analysis is &quot;less Quantitative, more speculative, and definitely more opinionated.&quot; He argued, based on Aristotle in the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, that innovation is increased by beliefs that life has a purpose and that the function of life is to fulfill that purpose; by beliefs about transcendental goods and a sense of goodness, truth and beauty; and by beliefs that individuals can act efficaciously as individuals, and a culture that enables them to do so. Murray argued that there is an absence of this in the current secularist and nihilist society which has caused the decline.

== Reviews ==

The American Library Association: Murray says, &quot;Achievements that require mental and spiritual effort are the highest forms of human endeavor&quot;. He has scanned the most reputable biographical dictionaries and histories of the Arts, Philosophy, and Sciences to find who and what, during 800 B.C.-1950, are mentioned in them. He came up with 4,139 people and a list of events and ponders 20 persons in each of nine scientific, three philosophic, and nine artistic fields who were most extensively covered in the resources. More than 80 percent are &quot;dead white males,&quot; and Murray carefully examines why. The greatest achievements of India, China, Japan, and Islam occurred well before the West took off during the Renaissance, and each of those cultures valued duty, family, and consensus, whereas the West prefers individualism, the sine qua non of scientific debate and discovery. Further, the scientific method was a set of Western &quot;meta-inventions&quot; (Murray&#x27;s term) that arose, fortunately, simultaneously with the ratification of Thomism, with its dual emphasis on Faith and Reason, by the most important Cultural force in the West, the Roman Catholic Church of overarching importance to great achievements in any culture. Murray argues that life has purpose and belief in ideals of beauty, truth, and goodness. This book probably won&#x27;t get Murray in as much hot water as &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; (1994) did. Then again, with its speculations that the rate of great achievements has slowed since 1800 and that the arts are in a very bad way, maybe it will.

<doc id="385619" wikidata="Q6508978" url="?curid=385619" title="League for the Fourth International">
<text>The League for the Fourth International (LFI) is a Trotskyist international organization that has sections in Mexico, Brazil, Italy, the United States and Germany. All of these are very small and based in at most one or two cities. Like other international Trotskyist groups, it fights for &quot;international socialist revolution, the conquest of power by the working class, led by its Leninist party.&quot;

==History==
Led by Jan Norden, it was formed by members who were expelled from the Spartacist League&#x27;s international the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist) on June 8, 1996 and the Grupo Espartaquista de México, forming the Internationalist Group. In addition to which the new Internationalist Group had links with the Liga Quarta-Internacionalista do Brasil which had been developing fraternal relations with the Spartacist League. The Liga Quarta-Internacionalista do Brasil, following the ICL&#x27;s break of fraternal relations with it, signed with the Internationalist Group their &quot;Joint Statement of Commitment to Reforge the Fourth International&quot;.

In early 1998, the ICL expelled the Permanent Revolution Faction from the Ligue trotskyste de France and at the same time declared that the key statement of the founding program of the Fourth International had been superseded.

In April 1998, the Internationalist Group, Liga Quarta-Internacionalista do Brasil and the Permanent Revolution Faction formed the League for the Fourth International, whose founding statement was Reforge the Fourth International (6 April 1998). 

In 2004, the LFI&#x27;s Dutch section, consisting of only one member, left to join the International Bolshevik Tendency.

==Actions==
The leading member is Jan Norden, former editor of the Spartacist League newspaper &quot;Workers Vanguard&quot; and founder of the LFI&#x27;s American section, the Internationalist Group. Their English language newspaper is called &quot;The Internationalist&quot;.

<doc id="385620" wikidata="Q228889" url="?curid=385620" title="Wu Cheng'en">
<text>Wu Cheng&#x27;en (, c. 1500–1582 or 1505–1580), courtesy name Ruzhong (), was a Chinese novelist, poet, and politician during the Ming dynasty. He is considered by many to be the author of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, one of the Classic Chinese Novels.

==Biography==
Wu was born in Lianshui, Jiangsu province, and later moved to Huai&#x27;an. Wu&#x27;s father, Wu Rui, had a good primary education and &quot;shown an aptitude for study&quot;, but ultimately spent his life as an artisan because of his family&#x27;s financial difficulties. Nevertheless, Wu Rui continued to &quot;devote himself to literary pursuits&quot;, and as a child, Wu acquired the same enthusiasm for literature—including classical literature, popular stories, and anecdotes.

He took the imperial examinations several times in attempt to become a mandarin, or imperial official, but never passed, and did not gain entry into the imperial university in Nanjing until middle age; after that he did become an official and had postings in both Beijing and Changxing County, but he did not enjoy his work, and eventually resigned, probably spending the rest of his life writing stories and poems in his hometown. During this time he became an accomplished writer, producing both poetry and prose, and became friends with several prominent contemporary writers. However, Wu remained poor throughout his life and did not have any children. Dissatisfied with the political climate of the time and with the corruption of the world, he spent much of his life as a hermit.

==Literary work==
===&quot;Journey to the West&quot;===

Wu&#x27;s likely authorship of &quot;Journey to the West&quot; is his main claim to fame. The novel was published anonymously in 1592, and Wu did not refer to the work in any of his other writings. Wu is thought to have published the work in anonymity, as was usual at the time, because of the ill repute of fiction as vulgar literature. There was a trend in Chinese literary circles to imitate the classical literature of the Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties, written in Classical Chinese. However, late in life, Wu went against this trend by writing the novel, &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, in the vernacular tongue. For over three centuries most of China remained unaware of its authorship, although the people of his hometown attributed the novel to him early on.

However, in the early 20th century, Hu Shih and his students conducted textual analysis and research into Qing dynasty records and suggested Wu as the author. In his Introduction to Arthur Waley&#x27;s abridgment, &quot;Monkey&quot;, Dr. Hu, then ambassador to the United States, reported that a 1625 gazetteer, a form of local history, from Wu&#x27;s hometown claimed Wu as the author. The &quot;Dictionary of Ming Biography&quot; comments that &quot;the identity of the author of the novel is thus still open to question,&quot; and that Wu &quot;probably would have remained in oblivion had it not been for this probably erroneous ascription.&quot;

Brown University China literature scholar David Lattimore said: &quot;The Ambassador&#x27;s confidence was quite unjustified. What the gazetteer says is that Wu wrote something called &quot;The Journey to the West.&quot; It mentions nothing about a novel. The work in question could have been any version of our story, or something else entirely.&quot; Translator W. J. F. Jenner points out that although Wu had knowledge of Chinese bureaucracy and politics, the novel itself doesn&#x27;t include any political details that &quot;a fairly well-read commoner could not have known.&quot; Furthermore, it is unknown how much of the novel was &quot;created&quot;, and how much was simply compiled and edited, since much of the legend behind &quot;Journey to the West&quot; already existed in folk tales.

Anthony C. Yu, in his introduction to his complete translation, states that the identity of the author, as with so many other major works of Chinese fiction, &quot;remains unclear&quot; but that Wu remains &quot;the most likely&quot; author.

===Other works===
In addition to &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Wu wrote numerous poems and stories (including the novel &quot;A Record of the Tripods of Emperor Yu&quot; 禹鼎记, which includes a preface by Wu), although most have been lost. Some of his work survives because, after his death, a family member gathered as many manuscripts as he could find and compiled them into four volumes, entitled &quot;Remaining Manuscripts of Mr. Sheyang&quot; 射阳先生存稿. Some of his poetry was included in contemporary anthologies such as &quot;A Digest of Ming Poetry&quot; and &quot;A Record of Ming Poetry&quot;.

Both his poetry and his prose have been described as &quot;stubborn&quot; and critical of society&#x27;s corruption, and in one of his few surviving poems Wu describes himself as having a &quot;defiant spirit&quot;. Wu&#x27;s poetry focused on the expression of emotions, and for this reason his work has been compared to that of Li Bai, although even the poems that he published with his name attached still were not quite modeled on the classical styles (although they were not as &quot;vulgar&quot; as &quot;Journey to the West&quot;). In addition to using his writing to critique society, Wu also took pride in the worldly nature of his work, as opposed to the more fantastic writings of some contemporaries; in the preface to &quot;A Record of the Tripods of Emperor Yu&quot; () he wrote, &quot;My book does not just deal with the supernatural; it deals with the foibles of men too.&quot;

<text>Plasma diagnostics are a pool of methods, instruments, and experimental techniques used to measure properties of a plasma, such as plasma components&#x27; density, distribution function over energy (temperature), their spatial profiles and dynamics, which enable to derive plasma parameters.

==Invasive probe methods==
===Ball-pen probe===

A ball-pen probe is novel technique used to measure directly the plasma potential in magnetized plasmas. The probe was invented by Jiří Adámek in the Institute of Plasma Physics AS CR in 2004. The ball-pen probe balances the electron saturation current to the same magnitude as that of the ion saturation current. In this case, its floating potential becomes identical to the plasma potential. This goal is attained by a ceramic shield, which screens off an adjustable part of the electron current from the probe collector due to the much smaller gyro–radius of the electrons. The electron temperature is proportional to the difference of ball-pen probe(plasma potential) and Langmuir probe (floating potential) potential. Thus, the electron temperature can be obtained directly with high temporal resolution without additional power supply.

===Faraday cup===

The conventional Faraday cup is applied for measurements of ion (or electron) flows from plasma boundaries and for mass spectrometry.

===Langmuir probe===

Measurements with electric probes, called Langmuir probes, are the oldest and most often used procedures for low-temperature plasmas. The method was developed by Irving Langmuir and his co-workers in the 1920s, and has since been further developed in order to extend its applicability to more general conditions than those presumed by Langmuir. Langmuir probe measurements are based on the estimation of current versus voltage characteristics of a circuit consisting of two metallic electrodes that are both immersed in the plasma under study. Two cases are of interest:
(a) The surface areas of the two electrodes differ by several orders of magnitude. This is known as the &quot;single-probe&quot; method.
(b) The surface areas are very small in comparison with the dimensions of the vessel containing the plasma and approximately equal to each other. This is the &quot;double-probe&quot; method.

Conventional Langmuir probe theory assumes collisionless movement of charge carriers in the space charge sheath around the probe. Further it is assumed that the sheath boundary is well-defined and that beyond this boundary the plasma is completely undisturbed by the presence of the probe. This means that the electric field caused by the difference between the potential of the probe and the plasma potential at the place where the probe is located is limited to the volume inside the probe sheath boundary.

The general theoretical description of a Langmuir probe measurement requires the simultaneous solution of the Poisson equation, the collision-free Boltzmann equation or Vlasov equation, and the continuity equation with regard to the boundary condition at the probe surface and requiring that, at large distances from the probe, the solution approaches that expected in an undisturbed plasma.

===Magnetic (B-dot) probe===
If the magnetic field in the plasma is not stationary, either because the plasma as a whole is transient or because the fields are periodic (radio-frequency heating), the rate of change of the magnetic field with time (formula_1, read &quot;B-dot&quot;) can be measured locally with a loop or coil of wire. Such coils exploit Faraday&#x27;s law, whereby a changing magnetic field induces an electric field. The induced voltage can be measured and recorded with common instruments.
Also, by Ampere&#x27;s law, the magnetic field is proportional to the currents that produce it, so the measured magnetic field gives information about the currents flowing in the plasma. Both currents and magnetic fields are important in understanding fundamental plasma physics.

===Energy analyzer===
An energy analyzer is a probe used to measure the energy distribution of the particles in a plasma. The charged particles are typically separated by their velocities from the electric and/or magnetic fields in the energy analyzer, and then discriminated by only allowing particles with the selected energy range to reach the detector.

Energy analyzers that use an electric field as the discriminator are also known as retarding field analyzers. It usually consists of a set of grids biased at different potentials to set up an electric field to repel particles lower than the desired amount of energy away from the detector. Analyzers with cylindrical or conical face-field can be more effective in such measurements.

In contrast, energy analyzers that employ the use of a magnetic field as a discriminator are very similar to mass spectrometers. Particles travel through a magnetic field in the probe and require a specific velocity in order to reach the detector. These were first developed in the 1960s, and are typically built to measure ions. (The size of the device is on the order the particle&#x27;s gyroradius because the discriminator intercepts the path of the gyrating particle.)

The energy of neutral particles can also be measured by an energy analyzer, but they first have to be ionized by an electron impact ionizer.

=== Proton radiography ===
Proton radiography uses a proton beam from a single source to interact with the magnetic field and/or the electric field in the plasma and the intensity profile of the beam is measured on a screen after the interaction. The magnetic and electric fields in the plasma deflect the beam&#x27;s trajectory and the deflection causes modulation in the intensity profile. From the intensity profile, one can measure the integrated magnetic field and/or electric field.

=== Self Excited Electron Plasma Resonance Spectroscopy (SEERS) ===
Nonlinear effects like the I-V characteristic of the boundary sheath are utilized for Langmuir probe measurements but they are usually neglected for modelling of RF discharges due to their very inconvenient mathematical treatment. The Self Excited Electron Plasma Resonance Spectroscopy (SEERS) utilizes exactly these nonlinear effects and known resonance effects in RF discharges. The nonlinear elements, in particular the sheaths, provide harmonics in the discharge current and excite the plasma and the sheath at their series resonance characterized by the so-called geometric resonance frequency.

SEERS provides the spatially and reciprocally averaged electron plasma density and the effective electron collision rate. The electron collision rate reflects stochastic (pressure) heating and ohmic heating of the electrons.

The model for the plasma bulk is based on 2d-fluid model (zero and first order moments of Boltzmann equation) and the full set of the Maxwellian equations leading to the Helmholtz equation for the magnetic field. The sheath model is based additionally on the Poisson equation.

==Passive spectroscopy==
Passive spectroscopic methods simply observe the radiation emitted by the plasma. They can be collected by diagnostics such as the filterscope, which is used in various tokamak devices.

===Doppler shift===
If the plasma (or one ionic component of the plasma) is flowing in the direction of the line of sight to the observer, emission lines will be seen at a different frequency due to the Doppler effect.

===Doppler broadening===
The thermal motion of ions will result in a shift of emission lines up or down, depending on whether the ion is moving toward or away from the observer. The magnitude of the shift is proportional to the velocity along the line of sight. The net effect is a characteristic broadening of spectral lines, known as Doppler broadening, from which the ion temperature can be determined.

===Stark effect===
The splitting of some emission lines due to the Stark effect can be used to determine the local electric field.

===Stark broadening===
Irrespectively of the presence of macroscopic electric fields, any single atom is affected by microscopic electric fields due to the neighboring charged plasma particles. This results in the Stark broadening of spectral lines that can be used to determine the plasma density.

===Spectral line ratios===

The brightness of spectral lines emitted by atoms in a plasma depends on the plasma temperature and density.

If a sufficiently complete collisional radiative model is used, the temperature (and, to a lesser degree, density) of plasmas can often be inferred by taking ratios of the emission intensities of various atomic spectral lines.

===Zeeman effect===
The presence of a magnetic field splits the atomic energy levels due to the Zeeman effect. This leads to broadening or splitting of spectral lines. Analyzing these lines can, therefore, yield the magnetic field strength in the plasma.

==Active spectroscopy==
Active spectroscopic methods stimulate the plasma atoms in some way and observe the result (emission of radiation, absorption of the stimulating light or others).

===Absorption spectroscopy===
By shining through the plasma a laser with a wavelength, tuned to a certain transition of one of the species present in the plasma, the absorption profile of that transition could be obtained. This profile provides information not only for the plasma parameters, that could be obtained from the emission profile, but also for the line-integrated number density of the absorbing species.

===Beam emission spectroscopy===
A beam of neutral atoms is fired into a plasma. Some atoms are excited by collisions within the plasma and emit radiation. This can be used to probe density fluctuations in a turbulent plasma.

===Charge exchange recombination spectroscopy===
In extremely high-temperature plasmas, such as those found in magnetic fusion experiments, light elements become fully ionized and do not emit line radiation. However, when a beam of neutral atoms is fired into the plasma, a process known as charge exchange occurs. During charge exchange, electrons from the neutral beam atoms are transferred to the highly energetic plasma ions, leading to the formation of hydrogenic ions. These newly formed ions promptly emit line radiation, which is subsequently analyzed to obtain information about the plasma, including ion density, temperature, and velocity.

One example of this is the Fast-Ion Deuterium-Alpha (FIDA) method employed in tokamaks. In this technique, charge exchange occurs between the neutral beam atoms and the fast deuterium ions present in the plasma. This method exploits the substantial Doppler shift exhibited by Balmer-alpha light emitted by the energetic atoms in order to determine the density of the fast ions.

===Laser-induced fluorescence===

Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) is a spectroscopic technique employed for the investigation of plasma properties by observing the fluorescence emitted when the plasma is stimulated by laser radiation. This method allows for the measurement of plasma parameters such as ion flow, ion temperature, magnetic field strength, and plasma density. Typically, tunable dye lasers are utilized to carry out these measurements. The pioneering application of LIF in plasma physics occurred in 1975 when researchers used it to measure the ion velocity distribution function in an argon plasma. Various LIF techniques have since been developed, including the one-photon LIF technique and the two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence (TALIF).

====Two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence====
TALIF is a modification of the laser-induced fluorescence technique. In this approach, the upper energy level is excited through the absorption of two photons, and subsequent fluorescence resulting from the radiative decay of the excited level is observed. TALIF is capable of providing precise measurements of absolute ground state atomic densities, such as those of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. However, achieving such precision necessitates appropriate calibration methods, which can be accomplished through titration or a more modern approach involving a comparison with a noble gases.

TALIF also offers insight into the temperature of species within the plasma, apart from atomic densities. However, this requires the use of lasers with a high spectral resolution to distinguish the Gaussian contribution of temperature broadening against the natural broadening of the two-photon excitation profile and the spectral broadening of the laser itself.

===Photodetachment===

Photodetachment combines Langmuir probe measurements with an incident laser beam. The incident laser beam is optimised, spatially, spectrally, and pulse energy, to detach an electron bound to a negative ion. Langmuir probe measurements are conducted to measure the electron density in two situations, one without the incident laser and one with the incident laser. The increase in the electron density with the incident laser gives the negative ion density.

===Motional Stark effect===
If an atom is moving in a magnetic field, the Lorentz force will act in opposite directions on the nucleus and the electrons, just as an electric field does. In the frame of reference of the atom, there &quot;is&quot; an electric field, even if there is none in the laboratory frame. Consequently, certain lines will be split by the Stark effect. With an appropriate choice of beam species and velocity and of geometry, this effect can be used to determine the magnetic field in the plasma.

==Optical effects from free electrons==
The optical diagnostics above measure line radiation from atoms. Alternatively, the effects of free charges on electromagnetic radiation can be used as a diagnostic.

===Electron cyclotron emission===
In magnetized plasmas, electrons will gyrate around magnetic field lines and emit cyclotron radiation. The frequency of the emission is given by the cyclotron resonance condition. In a sufficiently thick and dense plasma, the intensity of the emission will follow Planck&#x27;s law, and only depend on the electron temperature.

===Faraday rotation===
The Faraday effect will rotate the plane of polarization of a beam passing through a plasma with a magnetic field in the direction of the beam. This effect can be used as a diagnostic of the magnetic field, although the information is mixed with the density profile and is usually an integral value only.

===Interferometry===
If a plasma is placed in one arm of an interferometer, the phase shift will be proportional to the plasma density integrated along the path.

===Thomson scattering===
Scattering of laser light from the electrons in a plasma is known as Thomson scattering. The electron temperature can be determined very reliably from the Doppler broadening of the laser line. The electron density can be determined from the intensity of the scattered light, but a careful absolute calibration is required. Although Thomson scattering is dominated by scattering from electrons, since the electrons interact with the ions, in some circumstances information on the ion temperature can also be extracted.

==Neutron diagnostics==
Fusion plasmas using D-T fuel produce 3.5 MeV alpha particles and 14.1 MeV neutrons. By measuring the neutron flux, plasma properties such as ion temperature and fusion power can be determined.

<text>The International Federation of Liberal Youth (IFLRY) is an international liberal youth organization. It consists of a global membership of national youth organizations. These are often but not exclusively affiliated with political parties that are members of Liberal International.

IFLRY holds full member status to Liberal International and the European Youth Forum (YFJ), which operates within the Council of Europe and European Union areas and works closely with both these bodies. Since 2014, IFLRY has held special consultative status to ECOSOC. IFLRY also holds observer status to UNFCCC and has sent delegations to COP since COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009.

==History==
IFLRY continues the tradition of two predecessors. The first was the World Federation of Liberal and Radical Youth (WFLRY), founded in 1947 in Cambridge, United Kingdom. WFLRY aimed to be a global organization, but mostly had active members in Europe. This led in 1969 to the separate forming of the European Federation of Liberal and Radical Youth (EFLRY). WFLRY was dissolved in 1978.

In 1979, at the EFLRY 6th Congress in Silkeborg, Denmark, EFLRY renamed itself IFLRY International Federation of Liberal and Radical Youth. This marked the start of a global expansion of the organization. The 6th Congress is thus recognized as the founding congress of IFLRY.

In 2001, the organization was renamed into IFLRY – International Federation of Liberal Youth.

==Structure==
IFLRY&#x27;s highest body is the General Assembly, which meets at least every year. It adopts IFLRY&#x27;s political platform, the Manifesto, and decides about IFLRY&#x27;s activities. These are stated in a two-year Programme of Action. The General Assembly also decides on the federation&#x27;s policies by adopting resolutions. Furthermore, the General Assembly elects the Bureau and decides upon the budget.

The Executive Committee is composed of one representative from each member organisation and the Bureau. It meets twice a year and takes all policy decisions within the framework of the General Assembly&#x27;s resolutions.

The IFLRY Bureau consists of a President, a Secretary General, a Treasurer and four Vice-Presidents. The Bureau has the responsibility for IFLRY&#x27;s day-to-day management and is elected every two years. The IFLRY Bureau appoints an Executive Director who runs the IFLRY secretariat in Berlin.

<text>European Liberal Youth (abbreviated as LYMEC) is an international organisation of liberal youth movements – mostly the youth wings of members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party but also individual members.

LYMEC holds full members status to the European Youth Forum (YFJ). It is the official youth wing of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Party and holds separate votes in the statutory bodies of the ALDE Party.

Even though the organisation is now called European Liberal Youth, it is still known as LYMEC, which is the abbreviation of the name when the organisation was formed in 1976. It was then known as Liberal and Radical Youth Movement of the European Communities.

== Member organisations ==


== Positions ==
In 2020, LYMEC adopted a resolution, according to which the organisations call for recognition of Taiwan as an independent country. The initiative was submitted by the Danish member organisation Radikal Ungdom.

<text>Ahmet Necdet Sezer (; born 13 September 1941) is a Turkish statesman and judge who served as the tenth president of Turkey from 2000 to 2007. Previously, he was president of the Constitutional Court of Turkey from January 1998 to May 2000. The Grand National Assembly of Turkey elected Sezer as president in 2000 after Süleyman Demirel&#x27;s seven-year term expired. He was succeeded by Abdullah Gül in 2007.

Following his legal career, Sezer became a candidate for the presidency with the joint support of many political parties in Parliament. Following the 2000 presidential election, he took an ardent secularist approach on issues such as the headscarf, holding the view that secularism in Turkey was under threat. A quarrel between Sezer and Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit in 2001 led to a financial meltdown, attributed to the weakness of the coalition government as well as to the large debt owed to the International Monetary Fund.

The landslide victory of the conservative Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the 2002 general election led to strong opposition from President Sezer, who vetoed several proposed laws and referred others to the Constitutional Court. These included laws on banking reform and the lifting of the political ban on Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. During receptions at the presidential palace, Sezer refused to allow women wearing the headscarf to attend citing the laws on the separation of religion and state at the time; this resulted in the wives of Abdullah Gül and Erdoğan, Hayrünnisa Gül and Emine Erdoğan respectively, being barred from attendance. Erdoğan later said in public that he had &#x27;suffered a lot&#x27; from Sezer.

==Early life==
Sezer was born in Afyonkarahisar to Ahmet Hamdi Sezer and Hatice Sezer, Macedonian Turkish Muhacir parents who emigrated from Serres, Central Macedonia, Greece during the population exchange between Greece and Turkey following the Turkish War of Independence. 

After finishing Afyonkarahisar High School in 1960, he graduated from the Ankara University Faculty of Law in 1962 and began his career as a judge in Ankara. Following his military service at the Military Academy, he served first as a judge in Dicle and Yerköy, and then became a supervisory judge in the High Court of Appeals in Ankara. In 1978, he received an LL.M. in civil law from the Faculty of Law in Ankara University.

==Judicial career and appointment as chief justice==
On 8 March 1983, Sezer was elected as a member of the High Court of Appeals. As a member of the Second Chamber of Law, he was nominated by the plenary assembly of the High Court of Appeals as one of the three candidates for appointment as member of the Constitutional Court. Five years later on 26 September 1988, he was appointed as a member of the Constitutional Court by President Kenan Evren and was reappointed for another five years in 1993 by Presidents Turgut Özal (who nominated him) and Süleyman Demirel (who confirmed his position, since the latter died in office). 

On 6 January 1998, Ahmet Necdet Sezer was elected as chief justice of the Constitutional Court and served until his resignation in 2000, when he was elected as president.

==Presidency (2000–2007)==

He was elected president and sworn in on 16 May 2000, becoming Turkey&#x27;s first head of state to come from a judicial background. His term was due to expire on 16 May 2007, but because the Grand National Assembly of Turkey had failed to elect a new president, he retained the office &quot;pro tempore&quot; until 28 August 2007 (the Constitution of Turkey states that a president&#x27;s term of office is extended until a successor is elected).

On 21 February 2001, during a quarrel in a National Security Council meeting, he threw the constitutional code book at Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit. Some cite this falling-out as the main reason for what became known as &#x27;Black Wednesday&#x27;, a huge economic crisis. Others claimed that the rapid reforms called for by the accession negotiations with the European Union and Turkey&#x27;s strong ties with the International Monetary Fund caused the crisis.

Sezer was a firm defender of secularism in Turkey, a frequent point of contention between him and the ruling AKP party. On many occasions, he openly claimed that Turkey&#x27;s secular regime was under threat. Since he believes that Islam does not require women to wear headscarves, Sezer excluded legislators&#x27; wives who wore headscarves from official receptions at the Presidential Palace.

During his presidency, he pardoned 260 convicted felons, 202 of whom were captured leftist militants. (This type of pardon can be requested directly by the felon or the legal representative of the felon, but no political or court referral is necessary.) Some organisations have cited such pardons to criticise Sezer&#x27;s presidency. On the other hand, Sezer also enacted harsher laws to punish people connected with terrorism.

== Post-presidency ==

During the 2014 presidential election, won by Erdoğan, Sezer openly refused to vote, citing the lack of a secularist candidate as his reason.

Sezer endorsed Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu&#x27;s candidacy in the 2023 presidential election.

<doc id="385643" wikidata="Q724354" url="?curid=385643" title="Commerson's dolphin">
<text>Commerson&#x27;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii), also referred to by the common names jacobita, skunk dolphin, piebald dolphin, panda dolphin, or tonina overa (in South America), is a small oceanic dolphin of the genus &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot;. Commerson&#x27;s dolphin has two geographically-isolated but locally-common subspecies. The principal subspecies, &quot;C.c.commersonii&quot;, has sharply-delineated black-and-white patterning and is found around the tip of South America. The secondary subspecies, &quot;C.c.kerguelenensis&quot;, is larger than &quot;C.c.commersonii&quot;, has a less-sharply delineated dark and light grey patterning with a white ventral band, and is found around the Kerguelen Islands in the Indian Ocean.

The dolphin is named after French naturalist Dr Philibert Commerson, who first described them in 1767 after sighting them in the Strait of Magellan.

==Population and distribution==
Two disjunct subspecies of the dolphin are found in geographically disparate areas separated by 130° of longitude and about ; it is not known why they are thus distributed. Global populations are unknown, but the species is accepted to be locally common.

The main subspecies, &quot;C.c.commersonii&quot;, is found inshore in various inlets in Argentina including Puerto Deseado, in the Strait of Magellan and around Tierra del Fuego, and near the Falkland Islands (Las Malvinas). A survey in 1984 estimated there to be 3,200 individuals in the Strait of Magellan. 

Dolphins of the second subspecies, &quot;C.c.kerguelenensis&quot;, were discovered in the 1950s. They reside near the Kerguelen Islands in the southern part of the Indian Ocean, and prefer shallow waters.

In 2004, a vagrant individual of unconfirmed origin was sighted on South Africa&#x27;s Agulhas Bank, a location from the Kerguelen Islands and from South America. Though the Kerguelen Islands are closer, such a journey would require swimming against the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.

==Description==

===&quot;Cephalorhynchus commersonii commersonii&quot;===

The &quot;commersonii&quot; subspecies has a black head, dorsal fin, and fluke, with a white throat and body. The demarcation between the two colours is very clear-cut. This stocky creature is one of the smallest of all cetaceans, growing to around 1.5 m (5 ft). A mature female caught off of southern Patagonia, at 23 kg (51 lb) and 1.36 m (4.5 ft), may be the smallest adult cetacean on record. Its appearance resembles that of a porpoise, but its conspicuous behaviour is typical of a dolphin. The dorsal fin has a long, straight leading edge which ends in a curved tip. The trailing edge is typically , but not falcate. The fluke has a notch in the middle.

Sexes are easily distinguished by the different shape of the black blotch on the belly — it is shaped like a teardrop in males but is more rounded in females. Females reach breeding age at six to 9 years. Males reach sexual maturity at about the same age. Mating occurs in the spring and summer and calving occurs after a gestation period of 11 months during the spring and summer. The Commerson&#x27;s dolphin has been known to live up to eighteen years in the wild, while in captivity the oldest individual was at least 33 years old at the time of death.

===&quot;Cephalorhynchus commersonii kerguelenensis&quot;===
Dolphins of the &quot;kerguelenensis&quot; subspecies tend to be larger than those of &quot;C.c.commersonii&quot;, and differ in patterning in that they are dark grey instead of black, and light grey instead of white, except ventrally. The demarcation between areas of the pattern is also less clearly demarcated.

==Behavior==
Commerson&#x27;s dolphin is very active. It is often seen swimming rapidly on the surface and leaping from the water. It also spins and twists as it swims and may surf on breaking waves when very close to the shore. It will bow-ride and swim behind fast-moving boats. It is also known to swim upside-down, which is thought to improve the visibility of its prey.

This dolphin feeds on a mix of coastal and pelagic fish and squid. Those in the South American subpopulation supplement their diets with crustaceans. Individuals have been recorded as entering the Santa Cruz River to forage there during low tide.

They can be found in estuaries, especially during the breeding season.

==Conservation==
The IUCN lists Commerson&#x27;s dolphin as Least Concern in its Red List of Threatened Species. The proximity of the dolphin to the shore makes accidental killing in gillnets a common occurrence. The dolphin was killed for use as crab bait by some Argentinian and Chilean fishermen in the 1970s and 1980s, but this practice has since been curtailed.

The Commerson&#x27;s dolphin population of South America is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) because it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

==Captivity==
These dolphins have been known to be displayed in a few aquariums.

<text>Ali Hosseini Khamenei (; born 19 April 1939) is an Iranian cleric, politician, and dictator who has served as the second supreme leader of Iran since 1989. He previously served as the third president of Iran from 1981 to 1989. Khamenei&#x27;s -year-long rule has made him the longest-serving head of state in the Middle East, as well as the second-longest-serving Iranian leader of the last century after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Khamenei is a Grand Ayatollah and , and is considered the leader of Shia Muslims and the Axis of Resistance.

According to his official website, Khamenei was arrested six times before being exiled for three years during the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In June 1981, after the Iranian revolution and the overthrow of the shah, he was the target of an attempted assassination that paralyzed his right arm. Khamenei was one of Iran&#x27;s leaders during the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, and developed close ties with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, which he controls, and whose commanders are elected and dismissed by him. The Revolutionary Guards have been deployed to suppress opposition to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Khamenei served as the third president of Iran from 1981 to 1989, while becoming a close ally of the first supreme leader, Ruhollah Khomeini. Shortly before his death, Khomeini had a disagreement with his deputy—Hussein Ali Montazeri—and there was quandary for choosing a successor when Khomeini died. The Assembly of Experts elected Khamenei as the next supreme leader on 4 June 1989, at age 50. According to Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Khamenei was the man Khomeini had endorsed as his successor. Khamenei has been head of the servants of Astan Quds Razavi since 14 April 1979.

As supreme leader, Khamenei is the most powerful political authority in the Islamic Republic of Iran. He is the head of state of Iran, the commander-in-chief of its armed forces, and can issue decrees and make the final decisions on the main policies of the government in economy, the environment, foreign policy, and national planning in Iran. As supreme leader, Khamenei has either direct or indirect control over the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, as well as the military and media. All candidates for the Assembly of Experts, the presidency and the Majlis (Parliament) are vetted by the Guardian Council, whose members are selected directly or indirectly by the Supreme Leader of Iran. There have also been instances when the Guardian Council reversed its ban on particular people after being ordered to do so by Khamenei.

There have been major protests during Khamenei&#x27;s reign, including the 1994 Qazvin protests, the 1999 student protests, the 2009 presidential election protests, the 2011–12 protests, the 2017–18 protests, the 2018–19 general strikes and protests, the 2019–20 protests, the 2021–22 protests, and the Mahsa Amini protests. Journalists, bloggers, and others have been imprisoned in Iran for insulting Khamenei, often in conjunction with blasphemy charges. Their sentences have included lashing and jail time; some have died in custody. Regarding the nuclear program of Iran, Khamenei issued a fatwa in 2003 forbidding the production, stockpiling and use of all kinds of weapons of mass destruction.

== Early life and education ==

Born to Javad Khamenei, an Alim and Mujtahid born in Najaf, Iraq, and Khadijeh Mirdamadi (daughter of Hashem Mirdamadi) in Mashhad, Khamenei is the second of eight children. Two of his brothers are also clerics; his younger brother, Hadi Khamenei, is a newspaper editor and cleric. His elder sister Fatemeh Hosseini Khamenei died in 2015, aged 89. His father was an ethnic Azerbaijani from Khamaneh, while his mother was an ethnic Persian from Yazd. Some of his ancestors are from Tafresh in today&#x27;s Markazi Province and migrated from their original home in Tafresh to Khamaneh near Tabriz.

Khamenei&#x27;s great ancestor was Sayyid Hossein Tafreshi, a descendant of the Aftasi Sayyids, whose lineage supposedly reached to Sultan ul-Ulama Ahmad, known as Sultan Sayyid, a grandchild of fourth Shia Imam, the Ali al-Sajjad.

=== Education ===
Khamenei&#x27;s education began at the age of four, by learning the Quran at Maktab; he spent his basic and advanced levels of seminary studies at the hawza of Mashhad, under mentors such as Sheikh Hashem Qazvini and Ayatollah Milani. Then, he went to Najaf in 1957, but soon returned to Mashhad due to his father&#x27;s unwillingness to let him stay there. In 1958, he settled in Qom where he attended the classes of Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi and Ruhollah Khomeini. Like many other politically active clerics at the time, Khamenei was far more involved with politics than religious scholarship.

== Political life and presidency ==

Khamenei was a key figure in the Iranian Revolution in Iran and a close confidant of Ruhollah Khomeini. Since the founding of the Islamic Republic, Khamenei has held many government posts. Muhammad Sahimi claims that his political career began after the Iranian Revolution, when the former President of Iran, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, then a confidant of Khomeini, brought Khamenei into Khomeini&#x27;s inner circle. Later on, Hassan Rouhani, then a member of Parliament, arranged for Khamenei to get his first major post in the provisional revolutionary government as deputy defense minister.
Khomeini appointed Khamenei to the post of Tehran&#x27;s Friday prayers Imam in 1980, after the resignation of Hussein-Ali Montazeri from the post. He was briefly the vice Minister of National Defence from late July to 6 November 1979 and as a supervisor of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards. He also went to the battlefield as a representative of the parliament&#x27;s defense commission.

=== Assassination attempt ===

Khamenei narrowly escaped an assassination attempt by the Mujahedin-e Khalq when a bomb, concealed in a tape recorder, exploded beside him. On 27 June 1981, while Khamenei had returned from the frontline, he went to the Aboozar Mosque according to his Saturday&#x27;s schedule. After the first prayer, he lectured to worshippers who had written their questions on paper. Meanwhile, a young man who pressed a button put a tape recorder accompanied by papers on the desk in front of Khamenei. After a minute the recorder began whistling, then suddenly exploded. &quot;A gift of Furqan Group to the Islamic Republic&quot; was written on the inner wall of the tape recorder. Khamenei&#x27;s treatment took several months and his arm, vocal cords and lungs were seriously injured. He was permanently injured, losing the use of his right arm.

=== As president ===

In 1981, after the assassination of Mohammad-Ali Rajai, Khamenei was elected President of Iran by a landslide vote (97%) in the October 1981 Iranian presidential election in which only four candidates were approved by the Council of Guardians. Khamenei became the first cleric to be in the office. Ruhollah Khomeini had originally wanted to keep clerics out of the presidency but later changed his views. Khamenei was reelected in 1985 Iranian presidential election where only three candidates were approved by the Council of Guardians, receiving 87% of the votes. The only Iranian presidential election with fewer candidates approved by the Council of Guardians was the 1989 Iranian presidential election, where only two candidates were approved by the Council of Guardians to run, and Rafsanjani easily won 96% of the votes.

In his presidential inaugural address, Khamenei vowed to eliminate &quot;deviation, liberalism, and American-influenced leftists&quot;. According to the Iran Chamber, vigorous opposition to the government, including nonviolent and violent protest, assassinations, guerrilla activity and insurrections, was answered by state repression and terror in the early 1980s, both before and during Khamenei&#x27;s presidency. Thousands of rank-and-file members of insurgent groups were killed, often by revolutionary courts. By 1982, the government announced that the courts would be reined in, although various political groups continued to be repressed by the government in the first half of the 1980s.

=== During Iran–Iraq war ===

Khamenei was one of Iran&#x27;s leaders during the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s and developed close ties with the now-powerful Revolutionary Guards. As president, he had a reputation for being deeply interested in the military, budget and administrative details. After the Iraqi Army was expelled from Iran in 1982, Khamenei became one of the main opponents of his own decision to counter-invade into Iraq, an opinion Khamenei shared with Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi, with whom he would later conflict during the 2009–10 Iranian election protests.

=== After the war ===
In its 10 April 1997 ruling regarding the Mykonos restaurant assassinations, the German court issued an international arrest warrant for Iranian intelligence minister Ali Fallahian after declaring that the assassination had been ordered by him with knowledge of Khamenei and Rafsanjani. Iranian officials, however, have categorically denied their involvement. The then-Iranian Parliament speaker Ali Akbar Nategh-Nouri dismissed the ruling as political, untrue and unsubstantiated. The ruling led to a diplomatic crisis between the governments of Iran and several European countries, which lasted until November 1997. The accused assassins, Darabi and Rhayel, were finally released from prison on 10 December 2007 and deported back to their home countries.

== Supreme Leader ==

Khamenei has fired and reinstated presidential cabinet appointments. Iran&#x27;s Chief Justice Sadeq Larijani, a Khamenei appointee, has warned the president of Iran against voicing opposition to Khamenei.

=== Election as Supreme Leader ===

In 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini dismissed Ayatollah Montazeri as his political successor, giving the position to Khamenei instead. Because Khamenei was neither a marja&#x27; or ayatollah, the Assembly of Experts had to modify the constitution to award him the position of Iran&#x27;s new Supreme Leader (a decision opposed by several grand ayatollahs). Khamenei officially succeeded Ruhollah Khomeini after Khomeini&#x27;s death, being elected as the new Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts on 4 June 1989.

==== Leadership Council proposal ====

Initially, some members of the Assembly of Experts proposed the idea of a leadership council. Various lists were proposed and Khamenei was named in all of them. For instance, a council of three members, Ali Meshkini, Mousavi Ardebili and Khamenei, was proposed to lead Iran. According to Rafsanjani, he and Khamenei were against the proposal, while Ayatollah and Ayatollah Ebrahim Amini were in favor of it. Supporters of the council proposal believed that having a council would produce a higher degree of unity in society and more positive characteristics would be found in a council. In contrast, the opposers believed that an individual leader was more efficient according to past experiences in the case of the Judiciary Council.

Ebrahim Amini listed the summary of the reasons presented by the two sides. According to him, the opposers rejected the proposal because i) Evidence for Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist was true only for the guardianship of an individual and it was not clear who held the guardianship when there was a council. The guardianship of a council was not rooted in Hadiths and Islamic jurisprudence. ii) Previous council-type organizations, such as the broadcasting council and supreme judicial council, were not successful in practice and the leadership council would not do well for similar reasons. iii) People were accustomed to the leadership of an individual and a council of leaders was something unfamiliar to them. iv) An individual leader could act more decisively when dealing with critical and essential decisions and solving problems and crisis. On the other hand, the supporters of the proposal believed that: i) At the time, there were no &quot;Faqih&quot; equal to Khomeini or even two or three levels lower than him so that he could fulfill the expectation of people. ii) In the case of a council of leaders, the members could compensate each other, if any of them had some shortage in a field.

Finally, 45 members voted against the leadership council proposal while more than 20 people were in favor of it and the proposal was rejected. After the assembly rejected the idea of a Leadership Council, Khamenei was elected Leader by 60 of the 74 members present with Grand Ayatollah Mohammad-Reza Golpaygani receiving the remaining 14 votes. Although he eventually accepted the post, Khamenei made protestations of his unworthiness, saying &quot;my nomination should make us all cry tears of blood&quot;, and debated with the mujtahids of the Assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.leader.ir/langs/en/index.php?p=bio&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marjaʿiyyat criteria ====

Since Khamenei was not a marja&#x27; at the time—which the Iranian constitution required—he was named as the temporary Supreme Leader. Later, the constitution was amended to remove that requirement and the Assembly of Experts reconvened on 6 August 1989, to reconfirm Khamenei with 60 votes out of 64 present. On 29 April 1989, responding to the letter of Ayatollah Meshkini, the head of committee responsible for revising the Constitution, asking Khomeini&#x27;s viewpoint regarding the &#x27;marjaʿiyyat criteria, Khomeini said: &quot;From the very beginning, I believed and insisted that there is no need for the requirements of &quot;marjaʿiyyat&quot; (authority in jurisprudence). A pious mujtahid (jurist-intellectual), who is approved by the esteemed Assembly of Experts (&quot;Majlis-i Khobregan&quot;), will suffice.&quot; In a video that surfaced during the 2017–18 Iranian protests, Khamenei is seen before the assembly said he was not religiously qualified to be a Supreme leader. Khamenei, who was ranked as a Hujjat al-Islam and not a marja&#x27; as required by the Iranian constitution, said he would only be a &quot;ceremonial leader&quot;, and was reassured by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani the position would be &quot;temporary&quot; until a referendum, apparently planned for one year later.

On 29 August 2022, al-Haeri announced his resignation from the position of marja due to old age and illness. This was described as the first time in history a marja has ever resigned from his position. He called on his followers to follow Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran as &quot;the best person for the leadership of our people and removing the aggressors&quot;.

=== Political strategy and philosophy ===

Khamenei&#x27;s era has differed from that of his predecessor. He has, however, continued Khomeini&#x27;s policy of &quot;balancing one group against another, making sure that no single side gains too much power.&quot; But lacking Khomeini&#x27;s charisma and clerical standing, he has developed personal networks, first inside the armed forces and then among the clerics, while administering the major bonyads and seminaries of Qom and Mashhad. Having been Supreme Leader for three decades, Khamenei has been able to place many loyalists throughout Iran&#x27;s major institutions, &quot;building a system that serves and protects him&quot;. Former cleric Mehdi Khalaji and Saeid Golkar, describe Khamenei&#x27;s system as having creating a &quot;parallel structure&quot; for each of the country&#x27;s institutions (army, intelligence agencies, etc.) to keep those institutions weak.

According to Vali Nasr of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, &quot;[Khamenei] [took] many of the powers of the presidency with him and [turned] the office of the supreme leader into the omnipotent overseer of Iran&#x27;s political scene&quot;. In Nasr&#x27;s view, Khamenei is an &quot;unusual sort of dictator&quot;. Officials under Khamenei influence the country&#x27;s various powers, and sometimes bickering, institutions, including &quot;the parliament, the presidency, the judiciary, the Revolutionary Guards, the military, the intelligence services, the police agencies, the clerical elite, the Friday prayer leaders and much of the media&quot;, as well as various &quot;nongovernmental foundations, organizations, councils, seminaries and business groups&quot;.

Khamenei issues decrees and makes the final decisions on the economy, environment, foreign policy and everything else in Iran. Khamenei regularly meets with the president, cabinet members, head and officials of the judiciary branch, parliamentarians, among others, and tells them what to do. Khamenei has also fired and reinstated presidential cabinet appointments. Khamenei meets with foreign dignitaries, however, he does not travel overseas; if anyone wishes to see him, that person must travel to Iran. Apart from his time in Najaf as a student, Khamenei traveled to Libya during his time as president.

In his speeches, Khamenei regularly mentions many familiar themes of the 1979 revolution: justice, independence, self-sufficiency, Islamic government and resolute opposition to Israel and the United States, while rarely mentioning other revolutionary ideals such as democracy and greater government transparency. According to Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Khamenei has &quot;resisted Rafsanjani&#x27;s attempts to find a modus vivendi with the United States, Khatami&#x27;s aspirations for a more democratic Islamic state, and Ahmadinejad&#x27;s penchant for outright confrontation.&quot;

==== Privatization of state-owned businesses ====
In 2007, Khamenei called for privatizing state-owned companies, including the telephone company, three banks and dozens of small oil and petrochemical enterprises. After a few months, at a televised meeting with then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his Cabinet ministers, important clerics, the leader of parliament and provincial governors, the heads of state broadcasting and the Iranian chamber of commerce, Khamenei ordered: &quot;to pass some laws, sell off some businesses, and be quick about it.&quot; Khamenei warned that &quot;those who are hostile to these policies are the ones who are going to lose their interests and influence.&quot;

=== Dispute regarding status as Grand Ayatollah ===

In 1994, after the death of Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Araki, the Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom declared Khamenei a new marja. Several ayatollahs, however, declined to recognize him as such. Some of those dissidents clerics included Mohammad Shirazi, Hossein-Ali Montazeri, Hassan Tabatabai-Qomi, and Yasubedin Rastegar Jooybari. In 1997, for example, Montazeri &quot;questioned the powers of the Leader&quot; and was subsequently punished for his comments with the closure of his religious school, an attack on his office in Qom, and a period of house arrest.

=== Appointments ===
The table below lists some of the incumbent senior officeholders in Iran directly appointed by the supreme leader (sorted by date of appointment):
=== Political power following reform era ===
Khamenei developed a cult of personality; with supporters describing him as a &quot;divine gift to mankind&quot; and in which Khamenei critics are persecuted. According to Karim Sadjadpour of the American Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, several factors have strengthened Khamenei in recent years:

According to Christopher Dickey, to consolidate his power base, Khamenei has developed close relations with the security and military establishment while also expanding the bureaucracy inside the government and around his Beit Rahbari compound.

=== Financial assets ===

Writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Damien McElroy and Ahmad Vahdat observed: &quot;The ayatollah likes to cultivate an image of austerity but receives major commissions from the Iranian oil and arms industries and there have been regular claims that he and his son have amassed a fortune running into billions of dollars.&quot; A six-month investigation by Reuters has said that Khamenei controls a &quot;financial empire&quot; worth approximately US$95 billion that the Iranian Parliament does not oversee, a figure much larger than the estimated wealth of the late Shah of Iran. According to the Reuters investigation, Khamenei uses the assets of a company called &quot;Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam&quot; or &quot;Setad&quot; in Farsi, to increase his grip on power. Reuters &quot;found no evidence that Khamenei is tapping Setad to enrich himself&quot;, but did find that he used Setad&#x27;s funds, which &quot;rival the holdings of the shah&quot;, for political expedience – &quot;Setad gives him the financial means to operate independently of parliament and the national budget, insulating him from Iran&#x27;s messy factional infighting.&quot; According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, money from Setad is used to fund Khamenei&#x27;s Beit Rahbari compound, which employs over 500 stewards, as was reported in 2013. Hamid Vaezi, Setad&#x27;s head of public relations, said the information &quot;was far from realities and is not correct&quot;. The six-month investigation by Reuters found that, regarding the source of Setad&#x27;s funds, &quot;Setad built its empire on the systematic seizure of thousands of properties belonging to ordinary Iranians: members of religious minorities like Vahdat-e-Hagh, who is Baha&#x27;i, as well as Shi&#x27;ite Muslims, business people and Iranians living abroad.&quot;

Despite the negative accounts of Western sources, Iranian official authorities depict Setad as a vast charity foundation. In an interview in October 2014 with Islamic Republic News Agency, Muhammad Mukhber, the head of Setad, stated that over 90% of profits from Setad business activities are spent on improving infrastructure in the poor regions of the country, creating jobs and improving the well-being of people in these regions reflecting the top concerns of Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader, Khamenei for the Iranian society. He states that 85 percent of Setad&#x27;s charitable works occur in poor Iran regions. He cited the construction of several hundred schools, mosques and hussainiyas, as well as direct and indirect contributions to the formation of over 350 thousand jobs expecting a total of 700 thousands for the upcoming three years. Mukhber also cited a sum total grant of 2.21 trillion rials of &quot;Qard al-Hasan&quot;, interest-free loans, to 41 thousands families in poor regions of the country. He also revealed plans of gradual sell-off of Setad profitable businesses in the stock market with the aim of transferring their ownership into the hands of Iranian people. He also envisioned the construction and delivery of 17 thousand housing units to families in poor regions of Iran by 2018.

=== Challenges following 2009 election protest ===
In mid-August 2009, a group of unnamed former reformist lawmakers appealed to the Assembly of Experts – the constitutional body charged with electing and (in theory) supervising and removing the Leader – to investigate Leader Ali Khamenei&#x27;s qualification to rule. A week later another anonymous letter was issued &quot;calling Iran&#x27;s leader a dictator and demanding his removal&quot;, this one by a group of Iranian clerics. The letters were called a blow to Khamenei&#x27;s &quot;status as a neutral arbiter and Islamic figurehead&quot; and an &quot;unprecedented challenge to the country&#x27;s most powerful man&quot; though not a blow to his actual power as a leader. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;the phrase &#x27;death to Khamenei&#x27; has begun appearing in graffiti on Tehran walls, a phrase that would have been almost unimaginable not long ago.&quot;

The letter was addressed to the head of the Assembly of Experts, Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a &quot;powerful former president&quot; who also questions the election results. According to the Associated Press, it is unlikely the letter&#x27;s demands would be met as &quot;two-thirds of the 86-member assembly are considered strong loyalists of Khamenei and would oppose&quot; any investigation of him.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporting in mid-August 2009, a &quot;prominent Iranian cleric and a former lawmaker said on Sunday that they had spoken to some of the authors and had no doubt the letter was genuine&quot;. According to this cleric, the letter&#x27;s signatories number &quot;several dozen, and are mostly midranking figures from Qum, Isfahan and Mashhad&quot;, and that &quot;the pressure on clerics in Qum is much worse than the pressure on activists because the establishment is afraid that if they say anything they can turn the more traditional sectors of society against the regime&quot;.

=== Relations with former President Ahmadinejad ===
Early in his presidency, Ahmadinejad was sometimes described as &quot;enjoy[ing] the full backing&quot; of the Supreme Leader , and even as being his &quot;protege&quot;. In Ahmadinejad&#x27;s 2005 inauguration the supreme leader allowed Ahmadinejad to kiss his hand and cheeks in what was called &quot;a sign of closeness and loyalty&quot;, and after the 2009 election fully endorsed Ahmadinejad against protesters. However, as early as January 2008 signs of disagreement between the two men developed over domestic policies, and by the period of 2010–11 several sources detected a &quot;growing rift&quot; between them. The disagreement was described as centered on Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, a top adviser and close confidant of Ahmadinejad. Mashaei was vice president of Iran until being ordered to resign from the cabinet by the supreme leader, and was also an opponent of &quot;greater involvement of clerics in politics&quot;.

In 2009, Ahmadinejad dismissed Intelligence Minister Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje&#x27;i, an opponent of Mashaei. In April 2011, another Intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi, resigned after being asked to by Ahmadinejad but was reinstated by the supreme leader within hours. Ahmadinejad declined to officially back Moslehi&#x27;s reinstatement for two weeks and in protest engaged in an &quot;11-day walkout&quot; of cabinet meetings, religious ceremonies, and other official functions. Ahmadinejad&#x27;s actions led to angry public attacks by clerics, parliamentarians and military commanders, who accused him of ignoring orders from the supreme leader. Conservative opponents in parliament launched an &quot;impeachment drive&quot; against him, four websites with ties to Ahmadinejad reportedly were &quot;filtered and blocked&quot;, and several people &quot;said to be close&quot; to the president and Mashaei (such as Abbas Amirifar and Mohammed Sharif Malekzadeh) were arrested on charges of being &quot;magicians&quot; and invoking djinns. On 6 May 2011, it was reported that Ahmadinejad had been given an ultimatum to accept the leader&#x27;s intervention or resign, and on 8 May he &quot;apparently bowed&quot; to the reinstatement, welcoming back Moslehi to a cabinet meeting. The events have been said to have &quot;humiliated and weakened&quot; Ahmadinejad. However, the president denied that there had been any rift between the two, and according to the semiofficial Fars News Agency, he stated that his relationship with the supreme leader &quot;is that of a father and a son.&quot;

In 2012, Khamenei ordered a halt to a parliamentary inquiry into Ahmadinejad&#x27;s mishandling of the Iranian economy. In 2016, Khamenei advised Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, his former ally with whom his relationship was strained after Ahmadinejad accused his son Mojtaba Khamenei of embezzling from the state treasury, to not run for president again.

===2023 riots===
Khamenei rejected talks for referendums on the state&#x27;s future, questioning people&#x27;s judgment and causing public outrage. In 2024, he claimed that while speaking to his military he had been saying what words God put in his tongue.

=== Fatwas and messages ===

==== Fatwa against nuclear weapons ====

Khamenei has reportedly issued a fatwa saying the production, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons was forbidden under Islam. The fatwa was cited in an official statement by the Iranian government at an August 2005 meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. It&#x27;s been widely discussed by international officials and specifically recognized by the US administration.

The Iranian official website for information regarding its nuclear program has provided numerous instances of public statements by Khamenei wherein he voices his opposition to the pursuit and development of nuclear weapons in moral, religious and Islamic juridical terms. Khamenei&#x27;s official website specifically cites a 2010 version of these statements in the fatwa section of the website in Farsi as a fatwa on &quot;Prohibition of Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;.

Doubts have been cast by experts on the existence of the fatwa as it can be changed or modified as and when deemed necessary, as well as doubts on its authenticity, its impact, and its apparently religious nature. Gareth Porter believes that the fatwa is &quot;sincere&quot; and Gholam-Hossein Elham commented that it will not change.

====Fatwa on Islamic legal interpretation====

In 2000, Khamenei sent a letter to the Iranian parliament forbidding the legislature from debating a revision of the Iranian press law to allow more press freedom. He wrote: &quot;The present press law has prevented this big plague. The draft bill is not legitimate and in the interests of the system and the revolution.&quot; Earlier in 1996, he issued a fatwa stating, &quot;The promotion of music [both traditional and Western] in schools is contrary to the goals and teachings of Islam, regardless of age and level of study.&quot; Many music schools were closed and public (but not private) music instruction to children under 16 was banned thereafter. In 1999, Khamenei had issued a fatwa stating that it was permitted to use a third party (donor sperm, ova or surrogacy) in fertility treatments. This was different in &quot;both style and substance&quot; to the fatwa on Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) by Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak of Egypt&#x27;s Al-Azhar University in the late 1980s which permitted ART (IVF and similar technologies) as long there is no third-party donation (of sperm, eggs, embryos, or uteruses).

In 2002, Khamenei ruled that human stem cell research was permissible under Islam, with the condition that it be used to create only parts instead of a whole human. Also in 2002, after protests erupted in the capital, Khamenei intervened against the death sentence given to Hashem Aghajari for arguing that Muslims should re-interpret Islam rather than blindly follow leaders. Khamenei ordered a review of the sentence against Aghajari, which was later commuted to a prison sentence.

====Other messages====
Since becoming the supreme leader of Iran in 1989, Khamenei has issued annual messages on the occasion of Hajj for all Muslims (pilgrims). He continually invites all Muslims to Tawhid, and expresses the significance of Hajj in spiritual and social life. He also asks the Muslims to be aware of what he considers &quot;the conspiracy of the enemies&quot; by having a right comprehension and advises them to &quot;not be deceived by them&quot;. So far, he has issued 32 messages. A part of his 6 August 2019 message was as follows:
Khamenei was one of the Ulama signatories of the Amman Message, which gives a broad foundation for defining Muslim orthodoxy. As well as elaborating on the factors needed to create Islamic unity, he argued: &quot;neither the Shia Muslims allied with the British MI6 are Shias, nor the Sunni mercenaries of the American CIA are Sunnis, as they are both anti-Islamic.&quot;

====Other fatwas====

In 2010, Khamenei issued a fatwa that bans any insult to the Sahabah (companions of Muhammad) as well as Muhammad&#x27;s wives. The fatwa was issued to reconcile legal, social, and political disagreements between Sunni and Shia. In 2017, he issued a fatwa against women riding bicycles in public.

== Domestic policy ==

Some regard Khamenei as the figurehead of the country&#x27;s conservative establishment. Khamenei supported Mesbah Yazdi, describing him as one of Iran&#x27;s most credible ideologues before the 2005 election but &quot;recently been concerned about Mesbah&#x27;s political ambitions&quot;. In 2007, Khamenei requested that government officials speed up Iran&#x27;s move towards economic privatization. Its last move towards such a goal was in 2004 when Article 44 of the constitution was overturned. Article 44 had decreed that Iran&#x27;s core infrastructure should remain state-run. Khamenei also suggested that ownership rights should be protected in courts set up by the Justice Ministry; the hope was that this new protection would give a measure of security to and encourage private investment. In 2007, Iranian police under the direction of Khamenei launched a &quot;Public Security Plan&quot;, arresting dozens of &quot;thugs&quot; to increase public security. Additionally, Khamenei has stated that he believes in the importance of nuclear technology for civilian purposes because &quot;oil and gas reserves cannot last forever.&quot;

On 30 April 2008, Ali Khamenei backed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads&#x27;s economic policy and said the West was struggling with more economic difficulties than Iran, with a &quot;crisis&quot; spreading from the United States to Europe, and inflation was a widespread problem. The Iranian leader said that the ongoing economic crisis which has debilitated the world has been unprecedented in the past 60 years. He said: &quot;This crisis has forced the UN to declare state of emergency for food shortages around the globe but foreign radios have focused on Iran to imply that the current price hikes and inflation in the country are the results of carelessness on the part of Iranian officials which of course is not true.&quot; Khamenei emphasized that no one has the right to blame the Iranian government for Iran&#x27;s economic problems. He also advised people and the government to be content and avoid waste in order to solve economic problems. He added: &quot;I advise you to keep in your mind that this great nation is never afraid of economic sanctions.&quot;

=== Presidential, parliamentary, and Assembly of Experts elections ===
As Supreme Leader, Khamenei has influence over elections in Iran since the Constitution of Iran allows him to appoint half of the members of the Guardian Council and the Chief Justice of Iran. The Constitution also establishes that the Council approves or disqualifies candidates for office. At the same time, the Chief Justice presents the other half of the members of the council to be selected by Parliament. These constitutional provisions give Khamenei direct and indirect influence over the council; an entity that, in turn, has direct influence over who can run for government. This influence was evident in the 2004 parliamentary elections, in which the Guardian Council disqualified thousands of candidates from running—including 80 incumbents, many of the reformist members of Parliament, and all the candidates of the Islamic Iran Participation Front party. Subsequently, the Conservatives won about 70 percent of parliamentary seats. The election became a key turning point in the country&#x27;s political evolution as it marked the end of the campaign for political and social reform initiated by former President Mohammad Khatami.

During the 2005 presidential election, Khamenei&#x27;s comments about the importance of fighting corruption, being faithful to the ideals of the Islamic revolution, as well as on the superior intelligence and dynamism of those who studied engineering were interpreted by some as a subtle endorsement of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (who had a PhD in traffic engineering). After the election, and until recently, Khamenei was outspoken in his support for Ahmadinejad, and &quot;defended him publicly in ways which he never&quot; had reformist president Khatami. Khamenei would later certify the results of the 2009 Iranian presidential election.

Khamenei took a firm stand against the 2009–10 Iranian election protests, and stated that he would neither reconsider vote results nor bow to public pressure over the disputed reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He said: &quot;By Allah&#x27;s favor, the presidential election was accurately held, and the current matters should be pursued legally.&quot; In a public appearance on 19 June, he expressed his support for the declared winner Ahmadinejad. He accused foreign powers—including Britain, Israel and the United States—of helping foment protest against the election results. In particular, he singled out Britain, perceiving the country as the &quot;most evil&quot; of its enemies. He said that the Iranian people would respond with an &quot;iron fist&quot; if Western powers meddle in Iran&#x27;s internal affairs.

In response to reformist gains in the 2015–2016 election cycle, Khamenei lamented the loss of conservative clerics from the Assembly of Experts and suggested changes to the law by which the Guardian Council vets candidates may be needed because it is currently too difficult for the Guardian Council to vet so large a number of candidates.

=== Science and technology ===

Ali Khamenei has been supportive of scientific progress in Iran. He was among the first Islamic clerics to allow stem cell research and therapeutic cloning. In 2004, Khamenei said that the country&#x27;s progress is dependent on investment in the field of science and technology. He also said that attaching a high status to scholars and scientists in society would help talents to flourish and science and technology to become domesticated, thus ensuring the country&#x27;s progress and development.

== Foreign policy ==


Khamenei has &quot;direct responsibility&quot; for foreign policy, which &quot;cannot be conducted without his direct involvement and approval&quot;. He has a foreign policy team independent of the president&#x27;s &quot;which includes two former foreign ministers&quot; and &quot;can at any time of his choosing inject himself into the process and &#x27;correct&#x27; a flawed policy or decision&quot;. His foreign policy is said to steer a course that avoids either confrontation or accommodation with the West.

Khamenei condemned the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and compared Saudi Arabia to Israel. Khamenei also condemned the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and called Myanmar&#x27;s de facto leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung Sang Suu Kyi a &quot;brutal woman&quot;. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized Khamenei for his refusal to condemn the Xinjiang internment camps and human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in China. He condemned UAE as useless on several occasions.

After the U.S.&#x27;s 2018 withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, the 2020 assassination of Qasem Soleimani and the 2021 election of the conservative Ebrahim Raisi (who was supported by Khamenei) as President, Iran has taken a geopolitical course of further aligning with Russia and China. This became more evident in mid-2022, when Iran started supplying its HESA Shahed 136 drones to the Russian Armed Forces to be used against Ukraine. Coupled with Iran&#x27;s support for attacks on American forces throughout the Middle East after 7 October 2023 and the decades-long military and nuclear collaboration between North Korea and Iran, these developments have led a number of critics to speak of a new Iran-Russia-China-North Korea &quot;Axis of Upheaval&quot;.

=== Beliefs about the United States and its foreign policy ===
The United States and Iran have had no formal diplomatic relations since the Iran hostage crisis of 1980 when US embassy was taken over and US diplomats were taken prisoner. According to study by Karim Sadjadpour, speeches by Khamenei regularly mention the principle of resolute opposition to the United States; and according to Karim Sadjadpour he has &quot;resisted Rafsanjani&#x27;s attempts to find a modus vivendi with the United States&quot;, and once told reformist president Mohammad Khatami that &quot;we need the United States as an enemy&quot;.

On 4 June 2006, Khamenei said that Iran would disrupt energy shipments from the Persian Gulf region, where about 20% of the world&#x27;s daily supply of oil passes from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz very close to Iran&#x27;s coast, should the country come under attack from the US, insisting that Tehran will not give up its right to produce nuclear fuel. On 14 September 2007, on the 1st Friday prayer of Ramadan, Khamenei, who asserts that the United States is the main cause of insecurity in Iraq, predicted that George W. Bush and American officials would one day be tried in an international criminal court to be held &quot;accountable&quot; for the US-led invasion of Iraq. 
On 21 March 2009, a day after US President Barack Obama advocated a &quot;new beginning&quot; in diplomatic relations between the two countries, Khamenei said a change of US &quot;words&quot; was not enough and added: &quot;We will watch and we will judge (the new US administration) ... You change, our behavior will change.&quot; He rejected US foreign policy since the Islamic revolution, insisted the United States is &quot;hated in the world&quot; and should end its interference in other countries.

Khamenei criticized the NATO-led military intervention in Libya. On 21 March 2011, Khamenei accused the West of &quot;coming after Libyan oil&quot;. He also stressed that &quot;Iran utterly condemns the behavior of the Libyan government against its people, the killings and pressure on people, and the bombing of its cities... but it (also) condemns the military action in Libya.&quot; Khamenei stated that he support sending mediators rather than bombing the country.

In June 2011, Khamenei accused the United States government of terrorism and rejected the American definition of terrorism; he was quoted as saying, &quot;The U.S. and the European governments that follow it describe Palestinian combatant groups who fight for the liberation of their land as terrorists.&quot; In June 2012, Khamenei warned Western governments that the mounting sanctions on the country would only deepen the Iranians&#x27; hatred of the West. In October 2014, Khamenei said the U.S. and the U.K. created ISIS as a tool to fight Iran and &quot;create insecurity&quot; in the region.
On 19 July 2015, while speaking at a mosque in Tehran, Khamenei said to his supporters that the policies of the United States in the region were &quot;180 degrees&quot; opposed to Iran&#x27;s political and religious movement. The speech was punctuated by chants of &quot;Death to America&quot; and &quot;Death to Israel&quot;. Khamenei said in regards to the 2015 nuclear deal, &quot;Even after this deal, our policy towards the arrogant U.S. will not change.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that if the comments reflected policy, it was &quot;very disturbing&quot;, and &quot;very troubling&quot;.

On 24 June 2019, the United States imposed sanctions on Khamenei with the signing of Executive Order 13876. In March 2020, Khamenei warned against a United States offer of aid to fight COVID-19 because it could be a way to hurt Iran by further spreading the disease. He also suggested the US had developed a special variety of the virus &quot;based on Iranian genetic information they have gathered&quot;, although he provided no evidence for the theory. Khamenei explained, &quot;There are enemies who are demons, and there are enemies who are humans, and they help one another.&quot; In February 2024, it was announced that Meta Platforms had removed Khamenei&#x27;s Facebook and Instagram accounts, citing repeated violations of its Dangerous Organizations &amp; Individuals policy. In March 2022, Khamenei accused the United States of creating the conflict surrounding the Russo-Ukrainian War.

=== Condemnation of 11 September attacks ===
After the September 11 attacks, Khamenei condemned the act and the attackers, and called for a condemnation of terrorist activities all over the world but warned strongly against a military intervention in Afghanistan. He is quoted as saying, &quot;Mass killings of human beings are catastrophic acts which are condemned wherever they may happen and whoever the perpetrators and the victims may be.&quot;

=== Zionism and Israel ===

Khamenei is an opponent of the State of Israel and Zionism, and has been criticized for making threats against Israel and for antisemitic rhetoric. On 15 December 2000, Khamenei called Israel a &quot;cancerous tumor of a state&quot; that &quot;should be removed from the region&quot; and in 2013 called Israel a &quot;rabid dog&quot;, as well as in 2014 during the Gaza war, for what he called attacking innocent people. In 2014, a tweet from an account attributed to Khamenei claimed that there was no cure for Israel but its destruction.

In a September 2008 sermon for Friday prayers in Tehran, Khamenei stated that &quot;it is incorrect, irrational, pointless and nonsense to say that we are friends of Israeli people&quot;, because he believed that the occupation is done by means of them. &quot;[U]surpation of houses, lands, and business [of Palestinian people] are carried out using these people. They are the background actors of Zionist elements,&quot; said Khamenei in his speech. &quot;[W]e have no problem with Jews and Christians ... we have problem with the usurpers of Palestine land,&quot; he added. Also, he said that he had raised the issue &quot;to spell an end to any debates&quot;. In 2013, Khamenei accused France of &quot;kneeling&quot; before Israel, while saying that Israel was led by people unworthy of the &quot;title human&quot;. Nevertheless, according to anti-regime change activist Abbas Edalat, in 2005, Khamenei responded to a remark by then-President Ahmadinejad which had been widely translated as saying that the &quot;regime occupying Jerusalem should be wiped off the map&quot; by saying that &quot;the Islamic Republic has never threatened and will never threaten any country.&quot;

In a September 2009 sermon, Khamenei was quoted as saying that &quot;the Zionist cancer is gnawing into the lives of Islamic nations.&quot; In another report of the same speech, he stated that &quot;we will support and help any nations, any groups fighting against the Zionist regime across the world, and we are not afraid of declaring this.&quot; Khamenei instead proposed that &quot;Palestinian refugees should return and Muslims, Christians and Jews could choose a government for themselves, excluding immigrant Jews,&quot; adding, &quot;No one will allow a bunch of thugs, lechers and outcasts from London, America and Moscow to rule over the Palestinians.&quot;
On 10 September 2015, in a speech about Israel after agreement on the nuclear program of Iran, Khamenei made a remark &quot;Israel will not exist in 25 years&quot;. For the first time, the remark was published in Khamenei&#x27;s official website and his Twitter. This statement was reported as voted as the best and most important among Khamenei&#x27;s statements in 2015 by an online poll conducted by his official website. On 21 February 2017, at the 6th International Conference in Support of the Palestinian Intifada, Khamenei regarded the withdrawal of Israel from south Lebanon in 2000 and from Gaza in 2005 as two major achievements so far. Also, he advised the Islamic countries to refrain from &quot;useless&quot; crises and differences and instead concentrate on the issue of Palestine, which he regarded as the core issue of Islam. He added: &quot;Otherwise, the potentials and capabilities of the nations will go to waste in the face of vain struggles, which would provide opportunities for the Zionist regime to become even stronger.&quot;

In September 2020, Khamenei condemned the peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and charged UAE with betraying the Islamic world, the Arab countries and Palestine. He stated that the normalization will be only temporary, but the UAE will forever have to bear the shame regarding the deal. In October 2023, Khamenei praised the Hamas attack on Israel, but denied Iran&#x27;s involvement. He condemned Israel&#x27;s bombing of the Gaza Strip in retaliation for the Hamas attack and accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza.

==== Holocaust denial ====
A 2006 speech of Khamenei contains the phrase that was translated into English as &quot;the myth of the massacre of Jews&quot;. In a 2013 interview, Iran&#x27;s then-Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Khamenei had been mistranslated and his comments were taken out of context. Zarif added: &quot;I have spoken to the [supreme] leader on this issue, he rejects and condemns the killing of innocent people. No, the Holocaust is not a myth.&quot; On 21 March 2014, Khamenei said that &quot;the Holocaust is an event whose reality is uncertain and if it has happened, it&#x27;s uncertain how it has happened.&quot; Additionally, because of the potential legal consequences in some countries, he commented: &quot;No one in European countries dares to speak about [the] Holocaust.&quot; He also said that in the West &quot;speaking about [the] Holocaust and expressing doubts about it is considered to be a great sin.&quot;

On Holocaust Memorial Day, 27 January 2016, Khamenei posted a Holocaust-denying video on his official website. The video, drawing on the March 2014 speech and lasting about three minutes, features images of Holocaust deniers Roger Garaudy, Robert Faurisson, and David Irving. In December 2019, Khamenei praised Garaudy (a convert to Islam) and said that Garaudy&#x27;s conviction for Holocaust denial violated freedom of speech. In 2020, Khamenei tweeted asking &quot;Why is it a crime to raise doubts about the Holocaust ... while insulting the Prophet (PBUH) is allowed?&quot;

====Antisemitism====
Journalist Yair Rosenberg argues that statements by Khamenei purporting to attack &quot;Zionism&quot; are following an antisemitic tradition of avoiding censorship by using &quot;Zionism&quot; as a dog whistle for &quot;Jews&quot;. For example, an 8 June 2022 statement tweeted by Khamenei reads: &quot;The Zionists have always been a plague, even before establishing the fraudulent Zionist regime. Even then, Zionist capitalists were a plague for the whole world.&quot; According to Rosenberg, it makes more sense (although it is just as slanderous) if &quot;Zionists&quot; is replaced by &quot;Jews&quot;. The Zionist movement was not founded until the late 19th century, and thus Zionists are not likely to &quot;have always been a plague&quot;. Other accusations of antisemitism have come from Victoria Coates and Ellie Cohanim, who observe his Holocaust denial and find his &quot;nine-point plan&quot; to &quot;wipe&quot; Israel &quot;off the face of the earth&quot; uncomfortably reminiscent of Hitler&#x27;s Final Solution; and &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, who quote Khamenei&#x27;s attack on the 2020 Israel–United Arab Emirates normalization agreement: &quot;The nation of Palestine is under various, severe pressures. Then, the UAE acts in agreement with the Israelis &amp; filthy Zionist agents of the U.S. —such as the Jewish member of Trump&#x27;s family— with utmost cruelty against the interests of the World of Islam.&quot; They argue that &quot;filthy Zionist agents&quot;, &quot;the Jewish member of Trump&#x27;s family&quot; (i.e. Jared Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump), and &quot;cruel&quot; are all words channeling &quot;antisemitic tropes and dog whistles&quot;.

====Open letters====
Khameni has written several open letters. To the Youth in Europe and North America was written on 21 January 2015. Khameni wrote a second letter to the students enrolled at U.S. universities on 30 May 2024. While describing Israel&#x27;s actions as &quot;genocide and apartheid&quot;, Khamenei asked the students to continue their protests against what he called &quot;brutal Zionist regime&quot;.
In his letter, Khamenei expressed empathy and solidarity with the students protesting against Israel&#x27;s attacks in Gaza. He referred to these students as a &quot;branch of the Resistance Front&quot; and predicted their victory with the &quot;permission of God&quot;. Khamenei also runs a fund raising campaign for victims of conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon.

== Human rights, freedoms, protests, and Islamic law ==
Critics have accused Khamenei of overseeing the assassination of as many as 160 exiled defectors worldwide, the heavy-handed repression of protesters, the killings of tens of thousands of members of the M.E.K. (People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran) paramilitary group, and of making dissident writers and intellectuals in Iran &quot;a special target&quot; of repression, among other infractions of human rights. However, Khamenei himself has insisted human rights are a fundamental principle underlying Islamic teachings that precedes Western concern for human rights by many centuries. He has attacked Western powers who have criticized the rights record of the Islamic Republic for hypocrisy, saying that these countries economically oppress people in Third World countries and support despots and dictators. In response to Western complaints of human rights abuses in Iran he has stated that the American administration has committed many crimes and is therefore not fit to judge the Islamic Republic.

=== Protests during leadership ===
There have been several major protests during Khamenei&#x27;s reign, including the 1994 Qazvin Protests where according to Al-Arabiya around 40 people were killed and over 400 were injured, the 1999 Iranian student protests, the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, when protesters chanted &quot;death to the dictator&quot;, and ripped down pictures of Khamenei, as well as the 2011–12 Iranian protests and 2017–18 Iranian protests, among others. In 2016, Khamenei, who outlined the elections guidelines &quot;in line with Article 110 of Iran&#x27;s Constitution&quot;, asked to maximize the amount of transparency in elections in Iran, using modern technologies. During the Mahshahr massacre, protests expanded against &quot;government corruption, failing institutions, lack of freedoms and the repressive rule of Iran&#x27;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei&quot;.

During the 2018–2019 Iranian general strikes and protests, Khameini demanded punishment for those &quot;who disrupt economic security&quot;. According to Reuters, the remarks were &quot;clearly intended to send a message to Iranians who may plan more demonstrations&quot;. During the 2019–2020 Iranian protests, Khamenei met with various officials and cabinet members, saying he would &quot;hold the assembled officials responsible for the consequences of the protests if they didn&#x27;t immediately stop them&quot;. According to an official, Khamenei &quot;made clear the demonstrations required a forceful response&quot; and that &quot;rioters should be crushed&quot;. During the Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 protests, thousands of protesters demanded Khamenei&#x27;s resignation.

=== Minorities ===

The Baháʼí Faith is the largest religious minority in Iran, with around 300,000 members (8,000,000 members worldwide) and is officially considered a dangerous cult by the Iranian government. It is banned in Iran and several other countries. Khamenei has approved new legislation against Baháʼís in Iran and lessen their influence abroad. According to a letter from the Chairman of the Command Headquarters of the Armed Forces in Iran addressed to the Ministry of Information, the Revolutionary Guard, and the Police Force, Khamenei has also ordered the Command Headquarters to identify people who adhere to the Baháʼí Faith and to monitor their activities and gather any and all information about the members of the Baháʼí Faith.

=== Relationship with the press ===
In 2000, he was listed by the Committee to Protect Journalists as &quot;one of the top ten enemies of the press and freedom of expression&quot;, and was named to the &quot;Time&quot; 100 in 2007. Opposition journalists Ahmad Zeidabadi, Mohsen Sazegara, Mohammad Nourizad and Akbar Ganji were arrested and investigated for spreading critical articles containing unproven charges against Khamenei&#x27;s policies as the leader and some organizations. According to Iran&#x27;s Press Law &quot;spreading rumors and lies and distorts the words of others&quot; is not allowed. Also, according to the law, &quot;spreading libel against officials, institutions, organizations and individuals in the country or insulting legal or real persons who are lawfully respected, even by means of pictures or caricatures&quot; is not allowed.

In 2000, Ali Khamenei sent a letter to the Iranian parliament forbidding the legislature from debating a revision of the Iranian press law to allow more freedom. (The law had been used &quot;to close more than 20 independent newspapers&quot; from 1997 to 2000.) He wrote: &quot;The present press law has prevented this big plague. The draft bill is not legitimate and in the interests of the system and the revolution.&quot; This was called a use of &quot;extra-legislative power&quot; by reformists and opposition groups, but Speaker of Parliament Mehdi Karroubi reminded deputies that &quot;the constitution contained &#x27;elements of the absolute rule of the supreme clerical leader&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Kayhan&quot; and &quot;Jomhuri-ye Eslami&quot; are two newspapers published under the management of Khamenei. Among his controversial actions were his rejection of a bill presented by the Iranian parliament in 2000 that aimed to reform the country&#x27;s press law, and the disqualification of thousands of parliamentary candidates for the 2004 Iranian legislative election by the Guardian Council he appointed. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, &quot;Forbes&quot; selected Khamenei as the 21st, 23rd, and 19th most powerful person in the world, respectively, in their list of &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Powerful People&quot;.

=== Trials of people for insulting Khamenei ===
Several journalists, bloggers, and other individuals were put on trial in Iran for insulting the Supreme Leader, often in conjunction with blasphemy charges. In 1996, Abbas Maroufi was sentenced to 35 lashes and six months imprisonment for spreading lies and insulting Khamenei. Maroufi was also banned from working as a journalist and his literary monthly Gardoon was closed. Maroufi had compared Khamenei to former Shah of Iran Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.

In 2005, an Iranian was jailed for two years for insulting Khamenei and Imam Khomeini while being cleared of insulting the prophet. In 2009, Iranian blogger Omid Reza Mir Sayafi, who was arrested for insulting Khamenei in an internet post, died while in custody in Evin Prison. In 2010, opposition activist Ahmad Gabel was sentenced to 20 months in jail for insulting Khamenei, as well as 3 additional years for possessing a satellite receiver, a 3-year exile and a fine. In 2014, eight men, including a Briton, were sentenced to 19 to 20 years for insulting Khamenei and other charges relating to Facebook comments. In 2017, Sina Dehghan was sentenced to death for insulting the prophet, with an additional 16-month sentence for insulting Khamenei in a messaging application.

===Women&#x27;s and queer rights===

In July 2007, Khamenei criticized Iranian women&#x27;s rights activists and the &quot;Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women&quot; (CEDAW). He said: &quot;In our country ... some activist women, and some men, have been trying to play with Islamic rules to match international conventions related to women. This is wrong.&quot; Khamenei made these comments two days after Iranian women&#x27;s rights activist Delaram Ali was sentenced to 34 months of jail and ten lashes by Iran&#x27;s judiciary.

Khamenei advocates the Islamic practice of Hijab. He believes that hijab is aimed at honoring women. To the Western objection to the compulsory hijab in Iran, he responds by pointing out the compulsory unveiling in certain Western countries and obstacles created for veiled Muslim women who want to enter universities. He further argues that women in the West have lost their honor by pointing out a perceived high rate of sexual violence in the West as well as the widespread exploitation of female sexual appeal for commercial purposes.

Khamenei believes in gender segregation. Khamenei also believes that gender equality is a Zionist plot with the purpose to &quot;corrupt the role of women in society&quot;. On LGBT issues, Khamenei said: &quot;Today, homosexuality is a major problem in the Western world. They [Western nations], however ignore it. But the reality is that homosexuality has become a serious challenge, pain and unsolvable problem for the intellectuals in the West.&quot;

== Personal life ==

===Family===
Khamenei is married to Mansoureh Khojasteh Bagherzadeh, with whom he has six children; four sons (Mostafa, Mojtaba, Masoud, and Meysam) and two daughters (Boshra and Hoda). One of his sons, Mojtaba, married a daughter of Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel. His eldest son, Mostafa, is married to a daughter of Azizollah Khoshvaght. Another son, Masoud, is married to the daughter of Mohsen Kharazi. He has three brothers, including Mohammad Khamenei and Hadi Khamenei. One of his four sisters, Badri Hosseini Khamenei (wife of dissident Ali Tehrani), fled into exile in the 1980s.

===Home===
As Supreme Leader, Khamenei moved to a house in Central Tehran on Palestine Street. A compound grew around it that now contains around fifty buildings. Around 500 people are employed at this &quot;Beit Rahbari compound&quot; according to &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, and &quot;many recruited from the military and security services&quot;.

===Lifestyle===
According to Mehdi Khalaji, an Iran expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Khamenei has a decent life &quot;without it being luxurious&quot;. Robert Tait of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; commented that Khamenei is &quot;renowned for a spartan lifestyle&quot;. Dexter Filkins describes Khamenei as presenting himself &quot;as an ascetic, dressing and eating simply&quot;. In an interview with a women&#x27;s magazine, his wife declared that &quot;we do not have decorations, in the usual sense. Years ago, we freed ourselves from these things.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;Mother Nature Network&quot; reported that Khamenei has been seen riding around in a BMW car and published a picture of him exiting one. Khamenei, often seen as stern, enjoys poetry, gardening, and once smoked a pipe—unusual for a cleric. Despite his absolute power, he leads a modest life, rarely leaving Iran, and has been pictured happily tending his garden with a simple plastic watering can.

=== Health ===
Khamenei&#x27;s health has been called into question. In January 2007, rumors spread of his illness or death after he had not been seen in public for some weeks and had not appeared as he traditionally does at celebrations for Eid al-Adha. Khamenei issued a statement declaring that &quot;enemies of the Islamic system fabricated various rumors about death and health to demoralize the Iranian nation&quot;, but according to the author Hooman Majd, he appeared to be &quot;visibly weak&quot; in photos released with the statement.

On 9 September 2014, Khamenei underwent prostate surgery in what his doctors described in state news media as a &quot;routine operation&quot;. According to a report by &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, Western intelligence sources said Khamenei has prostate cancer. In September 2022, it was reported that Khamenei had undergone surgery for bowel obstruction and had to cancel a number of meetings.

== Literature and art ==
Khamenei has supported revising Farsi words and adding new words such as rayansphere instead of cyber space‌ and changing word radio to radian and using televisan instead of television.
In late 1996, following a fatwa by Khamenei stating that music education corrupts the minds of young children and is against Islam, many music schools were closed and music instruction to children under the age of 16 was banned by public establishments (although private instruction continued).

Khamenei has stated that &quot;poetry must be the vanguard of the caravan of the [Islamic] revolution... [T]hrough the arts and literature, the revolution can be exported more easily and honestly.&quot; It has been suggested (by Dexter Filkins) that this might explain his interest in banning books, prohibiting newspapers and imprisoning artists.
He has expressed interest in studying novels and stories since childhood and studied various novels of the world. He was &quot;fascinated by Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertrand Russell&quot; in his youth. He praised the works of Mikhail Sholokhov, Alexei Tolstoy, Honoré de Balzac, and Michel Zévaco. He said that Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot; &quot;is the best novel that has been written in history&quot;. He explained:

Khamenei suggested reading &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; to &quot;an audience of writers and artists&quot; and &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; to the high-level state managers as he thought it shed light on the history of the United States.

Khamenei is fluent in Arabic in addition to his native languages, Persian and Azerbaijani. He has translated several books into Persian from Arabic, including the works of the Egyptian Islamic theoretician Sayyid Qutb. When it comes to poetry, in Mashhad he used to participate in literary associations along with known poets and used to critique poems. Writing some poems himself, he chose the pseudonym Amin for himself. In the field of music, he is known to have a good singing voice and plays the tar, a traditional Iranian stringed instrument.

== Public diplomacy ==

In February 2011, Ali Khamenei supported the Egyptian uprising against their government, describing it as Islamic awakening instead of Arab Spring. Trying to communicate with Arab people, he addressed Egypt&#x27;s protesters in Arabic even though his native language is Persian. He introduced himself as &quot;your brother in religion&quot;, while praising the &quot;explosion of sacred anger&quot;. Later in &quot;Islamic Awakening&quot; conferences held in Tehran, Khamenei praised the Muslim youths of Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen and Bahrain for what he described as Islamic awakening. He also paralleled these events with Islamic revolution in Iran during his Nowruz oration in 2011. Major protests against the Iranian regime also broke out throughout Iran in 2011, and they became known as the 2011–12 Iranian protests. Khamenei wrote an open letter to American students in 2024, which garnered a harsh US reaction. In the letter he described US students protesting against Israel as a new branch of the Axis of Resistance and called on American students to familiarize themselves with the Qur&#x27;an.

<text>Raymond Emmett Berry Jr. (born February 27, 1933) is an American former professional football player and coach in the National Football League (NFL). He played as a split end for the Baltimore Colts from 1955 to 1967, and after several assistant coaching positions, was head coach of the New England Patriots from 1984 to 1989. With the Colts, Berry led the NFL in receptions and receiving yards three times and in receiving touchdowns twice, and was invited to six Pro Bowls. The Colts won consecutive NFL championships, including the 1958 NFL Championship Game—known as &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;—in which Berry caught 12 passes for 178 yards and a touchdown. He retired as the all-time NFL leader in both receptions and receiving yardage.

After catching very few passes in high school and college, Berry was selected in the 20th round of the 1954 NFL draft by the Colts and was considered a long shot to make the team&#x27;s roster. Diminutive and unassuming, his subsequent rise to the Pro Football Hall of Fame has been touted as one of football&#x27;s cinderella stories. He made up for his lack of athleticism through rigorous practice and attention to detail, and was known for his near-perfect route running and sure-handedness. Berry was a favorite target of quarterback Johnny Unitas, and the two were regarded as the dominant passing and receiving duo of their era.

After his playing career, Berry coached wide receivers for the Dallas Cowboys, the Arkansas Razorbacks, the Detroit Lions, the Cleveland Browns and the Patriots. He became the Patriots head coach in 1984 and held that position through 1989, amassing 48 wins and 39 losses. Berry led the Patriots to Super Bowl XX following the 1985 season, where his team was defeated by the Chicago Bears, 46–10. In recognition of his playing career, Berry was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1973. He is a member of the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team as one of the best players of the NFL&#x27;s first 75 years and a unanimous selection to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team as one of the best players of the NFL&#x27;s first 100 years. His number 82 is retired by the Indianapolis Colts and he is a member of the Patriots 1980s All-Decade Team. As of 2024, Berry is currently the oldest living former player inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==Early life and college==
Raymond Emmett Berry Jr. was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, on February 27, 1933, and spent the majority of his childhood in Paris, Texas. At Paris High School and in college, Berry caught very few passes. He did not start on his high school team until he was a senior, even though his father, Berry Sr., was the coach. After high school Berry played one year of junior college football at Shreiner Institute (now Schreiner University) in Kerrville, Texas, during the 1950 campaign. He helped the Mountaineers finish its most successful season in 10 years with a record of 7–3. He then transferred to Southern Methodist University (SMU). In three seasons for the SMU Mustangs football team, Berry received only 33 passes total. Sportswriters attributed his lack of receptions to his poor eyesight, but during the early 1950s, colleges specialized in the running game. As Berry said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t catch many passes because not many were thrown&quot;. He also played outside linebacker and defensive end for the Mustangs, despite weighing only even by his senior year.

==Professional playing career==
Berry was drafted by the Baltimore Colts in the 20th round as the 203rd overall pick of the 1954 NFL draft. Considered a long-shot to make the team roster, he was used sparingly as a rookie, catching only 13 passes. By his second NFL season he became a permanent starter when the Colts acquired quarterback Johnny Unitas. Over the next 12 seasons together the two became one of the most dominant passing and catching duos in NFL history. Berry, who did not miss a single game until his eighth year in the league, led the NFL in receptions and receiving yards three times and in receiving touchdowns twice.

In 1957, Berry caught 47 passes for 800 yards and six touchdowns, leading the NFL in receiving yards for the first time. Against the Washington Redskins that year in near-freezing weather, Unitas connected with Berry on 12 passes for 224 yards and two touchdowns, staging what the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; called a &quot;spectacular show&quot;. He was recognized as a first-team All-Pro by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; and earned second-team honors from the Associated Press (AP). The following season, he recorded 794 receiving yards and led the league with 56 receptions and nine touchdowns. For his efforts, Berry was invited to his first Pro Bowl, and was a first-team All-Pro by the AP and several other major selectors. The Colts finished atop the Western Division with a record of 9–3 and faced the New York Giants in the NFL Championship Game.

One of Berry&#x27;s most notable performances was in that 1958 NFL Championship Game, known as &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;, in which he led the Colts to the franchise&#x27;s first title with a then championship record 12 catches for 178 yards and a touchdown in the Colts&#x27; 23–17 victory over the Giants. At the end of regulation, he caught three consecutive passes for 62 yards to set up the Colts&#x27; tying field goal. He also had two key receptions for 33 yards during the Colts&#x27; final game-winning drive in overtime. His 12 receptions would remain an NFL championship game record for more than half a century, topped by one by Demaryius Thomas in Super Bowl XLVIII after the 2013 season.

Berry led the NFL in receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns in 1959, becoming the fourth player to record a &quot;triple crown&quot; in receiving. His 14 receiving touchdowns set a Colts single-season franchise record that stood unmatched for over four decades. He was invited to his second straight Pro Bowl, and earned first-team All-Pro honors from the AP, UPI, the Newspaper Enterprise Association, and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. The Colts won back-to-back championships in an encore with the Giants, 31–16. In that game, Berry caught five passes for 68 yards, second on the team behind halfback Lenny Moore&#x27;s 126 yards on three receptions.

In 1960, Berry recorded his only 1,000-yard season, catching 74 passes en route to career highs in receiving yards (1,298) and receiving yards per game (108.2). Each of those totals led the NFL that year by a wide margin; no other player had more than 1,000 yards, and the next highest yards-per-game average was 81.0. He had a mid-season string of six straight games with over 100 yards, during which he caught 50 passes for 920 yards and eight touchdowns. Berry again was a Pro Bowl invitee, and earned first-team All-Pro honors from all the same selectors as the previous year, including unanimous All-Pro recognition by UPI sportswriters.

Following this zenith, Berry did not have the same statistical success over his final seven seasons, but remained a consistent target for Unitas. His 75 receptions in the 1961 season was second-most in the league, and he finished 10th in receiving yards, but failed to record a touchdown for the first time since his rookie year. He scored the first touchdown of the 1962 Pro Bowl on a 16-yard reception from Unitas in the first quarter. His streak of Pro Bowl invitations ended at four, but he rebounded to appearances in 1963 and 1964, the latter his final. The Colts returned to the postseason in 1964, where they were shut out 27–0 by the Cleveland Browns in the 1964 championship game.

After consecutive seasons recording 700+ receiving yards and seven touchdowns in 1965 and 1966, Berry missed half of the 1967 season due to injuries and caught only 11 passes for 167 yards. He announced his retirement shortly after the season&#x27;s end. He completed his professional playing career having caught 631 passes for 9,275 yards (14.7 yards per catch) and 68 touchdowns. At the time, he held the NFL career records for receptions and receiving yards, and his receiving touchdowns were tied for fourth most with Don Maynard.

==Coaching career==
After retiring from playing, Berry joined Tom Landry&#x27;s Dallas Cowboys coaching staff as receivers coach. In 1970, after two seasons, Berry took a job with Frank Broyles at the University of Arkansas as receivers coach. In 1973 Berry joined Don McCafferty with the Detroit Lions as his receivers coach. In 1976, Berry joined former SMU teammate Forrest Gregg as his receivers coach with the Cleveland Browns. Berry joined the New England Patriots as receivers coach under Chuck Fairbanks in 1978. He stayed on with new coach Ron Erhardt until Erhardt and his entire staff were fired following a 2–14 1981 season. Berry left football and worked in real estate in Medfield, Massachusetts, until the Patriots fired Ron Meyer in the middle of the 1984 season and hired Berry to replace him. Under his leadership, the Patriots won four of their last eight games and finished the season with a 9–7 record. Berry&#x27;s importance to the team was reflected less in his initial win–loss record than in the respect he immediately earned in the locker room – according to running back Tony Collins, &quot;Raymond Berry earned more respect in one day than Ron Meyer earned in three years&quot;.

In the 1985 season, the team improved further, posting an 11–5 record and making the playoffs as a wild card team. They went on to become the first team in NFL history to advance to the Super Bowl by winning three playoff games on the road, defeating the New York Jets 26–14 (the second postseason win in franchise history), the Los Angeles Raiders 27–20, and the Miami Dolphins 31–14. It was the first time the Patriots had beaten the Dolphins at the Orange Bowl (Miami&#x27;s then-home stadium) since 1966, Miami&#x27;s first season as a franchise. The Patriots had lost to the Dolphins there 18 consecutive times, including a 30–27 loss in Week 15 of the regular season. Despite their success in the playoffs, the Patriots were heavy underdogs to the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. They lost 46–10 in what was at the time the most lopsided defeat in Super Bowl history. &quot;We couldn&#x27;t protect the quarterback, and that was my fault. I couldn&#x27;t come up with a system to handle the Bears&#x27; pass rush&quot;, Berry acknowledged.

The following season, Berry&#x27;s Patriots again recorded an 11–5 record and made the playoffs, this time after winning their second division title as an NFL team. However, they lost in the first round of the postseason. It would be Berry&#x27;s last postseason appearance in New England, and the Patriots&#x27; last playoff berth altogether until 1994. They narrowly missed the playoffs with an 8–7 record in 1987 (a strike-shortened season) and a 9–7 record in 1988, in which quarterback Doug Flutie went 6–3 as a starter. However, Berry benched Flutie in the season finale against the Denver Broncos until the final seconds. The Patriots lost 21–10 and Flutie left for the CFL less than two years later. Then in Berry&#x27;s last year as a coach, the Patriots finished the 1989 season 5–11. New Patriots majority owner Victor Kiam demanded Berry relinquish control over personnel and reorganize his staff; Berry refused and was fired. His regular-season coaching record was 48–39 () and he was 3–2 () in the playoffs.

After a year out of coaching, Berry joined Wayne Fontes&#x27; staff with the Detroit Lions in 1991 as their quarterbacks coach, and then held the same position the following season on Dan Reeves&#x27; staff with the Denver Broncos. Reeves was fired after that season, along with his entire coaching staff.

==Profile==
Berry overcame several physical ailments during his football career, a fact he became famous for, but one that according to Berry was often exaggerated by the media. He was skinny and injury-prone, such that when his college teammates saw him for the first time they sarcastically dubbed him, &quot;Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy&quot;. Reportedly, because one leg was shorter than the other, Berry had to wear padding inside his shoe to walk properly. However, according to Berry, this was not entirely true. In actuality, bruised nerves near the sacroiliac joint occasionally caused misalignment in his back, which in turn affected his legs and caused one to become slightly shorter; it was not a permanent condition. To alleviate this, he wore a back brace for 13 years in the NFL. That he required specialized shoes was a myth, which Berry says was perpetuated by an overzealous information director with the Colts when Berry tried to compensate for his condition by putting something in his shoe during training camp.

Due to his poor eyesight, Berry wore contact lenses when he played. Because the lenses would often slip when he did rapid eye movements toward the ball, he tried many different lenses, which led sportswriters to believe he must have had major eye problems. &quot;I tried all kinds of lenses till we got what we wanted,&quot; he said. &quot;I even had tinted lenses for sunny days, so I could watch the ball come right across the sun.&quot;

Berry was famous for his attention to detail and preparation, which he used to overcome his physical limitations. Considered slow for a wide receiver, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds. Rather than speed, he was renowned for his precise pass patterns and sure hands; he rarely dropped passes, and he fumbled only once in his career. He would squeeze Silly Putty constantly to strengthen his hands. He and Unitas regularly worked after practice and developed the timing and knowledge of each other&#x27;s abilities that made each more effective. The reason for this, according to Berry, was that the two did not think on the same wavelength. &quot;Every season we had to start all over on our timing, especially the long ball,&quot; said Berry. &quot;He knew he had to release the ball when I was eighteen yards from scrimmage for me to receive it thirty-eight yards out. I knew I had to make my break in those first eighteen yards and get free within 2.8 seconds.&quot; He also relied on shifty moves, and by his count, he had 88 different moves to get open, all of which he practiced every week.

Even in his adult years, Berry was soft-spoken and reserved. He preferred not to draw attention to himself, and was described by sportswriter Jim Murray as &quot;polite as a deacon, as quiet as a monk.&quot; Both as a player and as a coach, he was studious, serious, and orderly; &quot;He was too straight and narrow—but a great guy, a hell of a guy,&quot; former Colts teammate Art Donovan said of Berry. &quot;He was a little peculiar, to say the least.&quot;

==Honors==
In 1973, Berry was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. He is a member of the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team, selected in 2019, and of the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team, compiled in 1994 by the Hall of Fame selection committee and media to honor the NFL&#x27;s best players of the league&#x27;s first 75 years, and the 1950s All-Decade Team. In 1999, he was ranked 40th on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. In 2021, &quot;The Athletic&quot; selected him as the 63rd greatest player ever. Berry&#x27;s number 82 jersey is retired by the Colts, he is a member of the Patriots&#x27; 1980s All-Decade Team as a coach, and he is enshrined in the Baltimore Ravens Ring of Honor.

==Personal life==
Berry is a professed born again Christian and a member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He considers his faith to be a &quot;huge part&quot; of his life. As of 2009, he lives with his wife in Tennessee. On February 5, 2012, at Super Bowl XLVI, Berry carried the Vince Lombardi Trophy to midfield to present it to the New York Giants, who had just defeated the New England Patriots. He was given the honor due to the game being played at Lucas Oil Stadium, the home stadium of his former team, the Colts, who had moved to Indianapolis in 1984.

<text>Abdelaziz Bouteflika (; ; 2 March 1937 – 17 September 2021) was an Algerian politician and diplomat who served as the seventh president of Algeria from 1999 to his resignation in 2019.

Before his stint as an Algerian politician, Bouteflika served during the Algerian War as a member of the National Liberation Front. After Algeria gained its independence from France, he served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs between 1963 until 1979. He served as President of the United Nations General Assembly during the 1974–1975 session. In 1983 he was convicted of stealing millions of dinars from Algerian embassies during his diplomatic career.

In 1999, Bouteflika was elected president of Algeria in a landslide victory. He would win re-elections in 2004, 2009, and 2014. As President, he presided over the end of the Algerian Civil War in 2002 when he took over the project of his immediate predecessor President Liamine Zéroual, and he ended emergency rule in February 2011 amidst regional unrest. Following a stroke in 2013, Bouteflika had made few public appearances throughout his fourth term, making his final appearance in 2017.

Bouteflika resigned on 2 April 2019 amid months of mass protests opposing his candidacy for a fifth term. With nearly 20 years in power, he is the longest-serving head of state of Algeria to date. Following his resignation, Bouteflika became a recluse and died at the age of 84 in 2021, over two years after his resignation.

== Early life and education ==

Abdelaziz Bouteflika was born on 2 March 1937 in Oujda, Morocco. He was the son of Mansouria Ghezlaoui and Ahmed Bouteflika from Tlemcen, Algeria. He had three half-sisters (Fatima, Yamina, and Aïcha), as well as four brothers (Abdelghani, Mustapha, Abderahim, and Saïd) and one sister (Latifa). Saïd Bouteflika, 20 years his junior, would later be appointed special counselor to his brother in 1999. Unlike Saïd, who was raised mostly in Tlemcen, Abdelaziz grew up in Oujda, where his father had emigrated as a youngster. The son of a zaouia sheikh, he was well-versed in the Qur&#x27;an. He successively attended three schools in Oudja: Sidi Ziane, El Hoceinia, and Abdel Moumen High Schools, where he reportedly excelled academically. He was also affiliated with Qadiriyya Zaouia in Oujda.

In 1956, Bouteflika went to the village of Ouled Amer near Tlemcen and subsequently joined—at the age of 19—the National Liberation Army, which was a military branch of the National Liberation Front. He received his military education at the École des Cadres in Dar El Kebdani, Morocco. In 1957–1958, he was designated a controller of Wilaya V, making reports on the conditions at the Moroccan border and in west Algeria, but later became the administrative secretary of Houari Boumédiène. He became one of his closest collaborators and a core member of his Oujda Group. In 1960, he was assigned to leading the Malian Front in the Algerian south and became known for his nom de guerre of Abdelkader al-Mali, which has survived until today. In 1962, at the arrival of independence, he aligned with Boumédienne and the border armies in support of Ahmed Ben Bella against the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic.

==Career ==

Following independence in 1962, Bouteflika became deputy for Tlemcen in the Constituent Assembly and Minister for Youth and Sport in the government led by Ahmed Ben Bella; the following year, he was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs.

He was a prime mover in the military coup led by Houari Boumediene that overthrew Ben Bella on 19 June 1965. Bouteflika continued as Minister for Foreign Affairs until the death of President Boumédienne in 1978.

He also served as president of the United Nations General Assembly in 1974 and of the seventh special session in 1975, becoming the youngest person to have done so. Algeria at this time was a leader of the Non-Aligned Nations Movement. He had discussions there with Henry Kissinger in the first talks between the United States and Algerian officials since the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

On 12 November 1974, in his capacity as president of the General Assembly, Bouteflika suspended the then Apartheid government of South Africa from participating in the 29th session of the UN. The suspension was challenged by the US, but upheld by the assembly by a vote of 91 to 22 on 13 November.

In 1981, he was charged with having stolen Algerian embassies&#x27; money between 1965 and 1979. On 8 August 1983, Bouteflika was convicted by the Court of Financial Auditors and found guilty of having fraudulently taken 60 million dinars during his diplomatic career. Bouteflika was granted amnesty by President Chadli Bendjedid, his colleagues Senouci and Boudjakdji were jailed. After the amnesty, Bouteflika was given back his diplomatic passport, a villa where he used to live but did not own, and all his debt was erased. He never paid back the money &quot;he reserved for a new foreign affairs ministry&#x27;s building&quot;.

===Succession struggle, corruption and exile ===

Following Boumédienne&#x27;s unexpected death in 1978, Bouteflika was seen as one of the two main candidates to succeed the powerful president. Bouteflika was thought to represent the party&#x27;s &quot;right wing&quot; that was more open to economic reform and rapprochement with the West. Colonel Mohamed Salah Yahiaoui represented the &quot;boumédiennist&quot; left wing. In the end, the military opted for a compromise candidate, the senior army colonel Chadli Bendjedid. Bouteflika was reassigned the role of Minister of State, but successively lost power as Bendjedid&#x27;s policies of &quot;de-Boumédiennisation&quot; marginalised the old guard.

In 1981, Bouteflika went into exile fleeing corruption charges. In 1983, he was convicted of corruption.
After six years abroad, in 1989, the army brought him back to the Central Committee of the FLN, after the country had entered a troubled period of unrest and disorganised attempts at reform, with power-struggles between Bendjedid and a group of army generals paralysing decision-making.

 In 1992, the reform process ended abruptly when the army took power and scrapped elections that were about to bring the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front to power. This triggered a civil war that would last throughout the 1990s. During this period, Bouteflika stayed on the sidelines, with little presence in the media and no political role. In January 1994, Bouteflika was said to have refused the Army&#x27;s proposal to succeed the assassinated president, Mohamed Boudiaf; he claimed later that this was because the army would not grant him full control over the armed forces. Instead, General Liamine Zéroual became president.

=== First term as President, 1999–2004 ===

In 1999, after Zéroual unexpectedly stepped down and announced early elections, Bouteflika successfully ran for president as an independent candidate, supported by the military. All other candidates withdrew from the election immediately prior to the vote, citing fraud concerns. Bouteflika subsequently organised a referendum on his policies to restore peace and security to Algeria (involving amnesties for Islamist guerrillas) and to test his support among his countrymen after the contested election. He won with 81% of the vote, but this figure was also disputed by opponents.

=== Foreign policy ===
Bouteflika presided over the Organisation of African Unity in 2000, secured the Algiers Peace Treaty between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and supported peace efforts in the African Great Lakes region. He also secured a friendship treaty with nearby Spain in 2002, and welcomed president Jacques Chirac of France on a state visit to Algiers in 2003. This was intended as a prelude to the signature of a friendship treaty.

Algeria has been particularly active in African relations, and in mending ties with the West, as well as trying to some extent to resurrect its role in the declining non-Aligned movement. However, it has played a more limited role in Arab politics, its other traditional sphere of interest. Relations with the Kingdom of Morocco remained quite tense, with diplomatic clashes on the issue of the Western Sahara, despite some expectations of a thaw in 1999, which was also the year of King Mohamed VI&#x27;s accession to the throne in Morocco.

=== Second term as President, 2004–2009 ===
On 8 April 2004, Bouteflika was re-elected by an unexpectedly high 85% of the vote in an election that was accepted by Western observers as a free and fair election. This was contested by his rival and former chief of staff Ali Benflis. Several newspapers alleged that the election had not been fair. Frustration was expressed over extensive state control over the broadcast media. The electoral victory was widely seen as a confirmation of Bouteflika&#x27;s strengthening control over the state, cemented through forcing General Mohammed Lamari to resign as his chief of staff and replacing him &quot;with Ahmed Salah Gaid, his close friend and ally.&quot;

Only 17% of people in Kabylia voted in 2004, which represented a significant increase over the violence-ridden legislative elections of 2002. Country-wide, the registered turnout rate was 59%.

=== Reconciliation plan ===

During the first year of his second term, Bouteflika held a referendum on his &quot;Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation&quot;, inspired by the 1995 &quot;Sant&#x27;Egidio Platform&quot; document. The law born of the referendum showed that one of Bouteflika&#x27;s goals in promoting this blanket amnesty plan was to help Algeria recover its image internationally and to guarantee immunity to institutional actors.

The first year of Bouteflika&#x27;s second term implemented the Complementary Plan for Economic Growth Support (PCSC), which aimed for the construction of 1 million housing units, the creation of 2 million jobs, the completion of the East–west highway, the completion of the Algiers subway project, the delivery of the new Algiers airport, and other similar large scale infrastructure projects.

The PCSC totaled $60 billion of spending over the five-year period. Bouteflika also aimed to bring down the external debt from $21 billion to $12 billion in the same time. He also obtained from Parliament the reform of the law governing the oil and gas industries, despite initial opposition from the workers unions. However, Bouteflika subsequently stepped back from this position and supported amendments to the hydrocarbon law in 2006, which propose watering down some of the clauses of the 2005 legislation relating to the role of Sonatrach, the state owned oil &amp; gas company, in new developments.

=== Foreign policy ===
During Bouteflika&#x27;s second term he was sharply critical of the law—passed after the 2005 French riots—ordering French history school books to teach that French colonisation had positive effects abroad, especially in North Africa. The diplomatic crisis which ensued delayed the signing of a friendship treaty between the two countries.

Ties to Russia were strengthened and Russia agreed to forgive debts if Algeria began buying arms and gave Russian gas companies (Gazprom, Itera, and Lukoil) access to joint fossil-fuel ventures in Algeria.

In 2004 Bouteflika organised the Arab League Summit and became President of the Arab League for one year; however his calls for reform of the League did not gain sufficient support to pass during the Algiers summit.

At the March 2005 meeting of Arab leaders, held in Algiers, Bouteflika spoke out strongly against Israel, &quot;The Israelis&#x27; continuous killing and refusal of a comprehensive and lasting peace, which the Arab world is calling for, requires from us to fully support the Palestinian people.&quot; Despite criticism from the west, specifically the United States, Bouteflika insisted that Arab nations would reform at their own pace.

On 16 July 2009, President of Vietnam Nguyễn Minh Triết, met with Bouteflika on the sidelines of the 15th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit in Egypt. President Triet and Bouteflika agreed that the two countries still have great potential for development of political and trade relations. Triet praised the Algerian government for creating favourable conditions for the Vietnam Oil and Gas Group to invest in oil and gas exploration and exploitation in Algeria.

In March 2016, the foreign ministers of the Arab league voted to declare Hezbollah a terrorist organization, Bouteflika voted with Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq to reject the motion.

In sub-Saharan Africa, a major concern of Bouteflika&#x27;s Algeria had been on-and-off Tuareg rebellions in northern Mali. Algeria has asserted itself forcefully as mediator in the conflict, perhaps underlining its growing regional influence. Compromise peace agreements were reached in 2007 and 2008, both mediated by Algiers.

=== Constitutional amendment for a third term ===

In 2006, Bouteflika appointed a new Prime Minister, Abdelaziz Belkhadem. Belkhadem then announced plans that violate the Algerian Constitution to allow the President to run for office indefinitely and increase his powers. This was widely regarded as aimed to let Bouteflika run for president for a third term. In 2008, Belkhadem was shifted out of the premiership and his predecessor Ahmed Ouyahia brought in, having also come out in favor of the constitutional amendment.

The Council of Ministers announced on 3 November 2008 that the planned constitutional revision proposal would remove the presidential term limit previously included in Article 74. The People&#x27;s National Assembly endorsed the removal of the term limit on 12 November 2008; only the Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD) voted against its removal.

=== Third term as President, 2009–2014 ===

Following the constitutional amendment allowing him to run for a third term, on 12 February 2009, Bouteflika announced his independent candidacy in the 2009 presidential election. On 10 April 2009, it was announced that Bouteflika had won the election with 90.24% of the vote, on a turnout of 74%, thereby obtaining a new five-year term. Several opposition parties had boycotted the election, with the opposition Socialist Forces Front citing a &quot;tsunami of massive fraud&quot;.

=== 2010–2012 Algerian protests ===

In 2010, journalists gathered to demonstrate for press freedom and against Bouteflika&#x27;s self-appointed role as editor-in-chief of Algeria&#x27;s state television station. In February 2011, the government rescinded the state of emergency that had been in place since 1992 but still banned all protest gatherings and demonstrations. However, in April 2011, over 2,000 protesters defied an official ban and took to the streets of Algiers, clashing with police forces. Protesters noted that they were inspired by the recent Egyptian Revolution, and that Algeria was a police state and &quot;corrupt to the bone&quot;.

=== Fourth term as President, 2014–2019 ===

Following yet another constitutional amendment, allowing him to run for a fourth term, Bouteflika announced that he would. He met the electoral law requiring a candidate to collect over 60,000 signatures from supporters in 25 provinces. On 18 April 2014, he was re-elected with 81% of the vote, while Benflis was second placed with 12.18%. The turnout was 51.7%, down from the 75% turnout in 2009. Several opposition parties boycotted the election again, resulting in allegations of fraud.

Bouteflika cabled his congratulations to freshly-reelected Bashar al-Assad on 19 April 2014. Bouteflika was admitted to a clinic at Grenoble in France in November 2014. In November 2016, he was hospitalized in France for medical checks.

On 20 February 2017, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel canceled her trip to Algeria an hour before takeoff, reportedly because Bouteflika had severe bronchitis.
In June 2017, Bouteflika made a rare, and brief, appearance on Algerian state television presiding over a cabinet meeting with his new government. In a written statement, he ordered the government to reduce imports, curb spending, and be wary of foreign debt. He called for banking sector reform and more investment in renewable energy and &quot;unconventional fossil hydrocarbons&quot;. Bouteflika was reliant on a wheelchair and had not given a speech in public since 2014 due to aphasia following his stroke. That same year, he made his final public appearance while unveiling a new metro station and the newly renovated Ketchaoua Mosque in Algiers.

During his final term as president, Bouteflika was usually not been seen in public for more than two years, and several of his close associates had not seen him for more than one year. It was alleged that he could hardly speak and communicated by letter with his ministers.

=== Candidacy for fifth term, protests, and resignation ===
On 10 February 2019, a press release signed by the long-ailing Bouteflika announcing he would seek a fifth consecutive term provoked widespread discontent. Youth protesters demanded his picture be removed from city halls in Kenchela and Annaba in the days before the national demonstrations on 22 February, organized via social media. Those in Algiers, where street protests are illegal, were the biggest in nearly 18 years. Protestors ripped down a giant poster of Bouteflika from the landmark Algiers central post office.

On 11 March 2019, after sustained protests, Bouteflika announced that he would not seek a new term. However, his withdrawal from the elections was not enough to end the protests. On 31 March 2019, Bouteflika along with the Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui who had taken office 20 days earlier, formed a 27-member cabinet with only 6 of the appointees being retained from the outgoing president administration. The next day, Bouteflika announced that he would resign by 28 April 2019. Acceding to demands by the army chief of staff, he ultimately resigned a day later, on 2 April 2019.

Following his resignation, Bouteflika resumed his reclusiveness and made no public appearances due to failing health. Bouteflika spent his final years in a medicalised state residence in Zéralda, a suburb of Algiers. He also had a private residence in El Biar.

== Personal life and death ==
In November 2005, Bouteflika was admitted to a hospital in France, reportedly had a gastric ulcer hemorrhage, and discharged three weeks later. However, the length of time for which Bouteflika remained virtually incommunicado led to rumours that he was critically ill with stomach cancer. He checked into the hospital again in April 2006.

A leaked diplomatic cable revealed that, by the end of 2008, Bouteflika had developed stomach cancer.

In 2013, Bouteflika had a debilitating stroke. A journalist, Hichem Aboud, was pursued for &quot;threatening national security, territorial integrity, and normal management of the Republic&#x27;s institutions&quot; and the newspapers for which he wrote were censored, because he wrote that the President had returned from Val-de-Grâce in a &quot;comatose state&quot; and had characterized Saïd Bouteflika as the puppet-master running the administration.

On 17 September 2021 Bouteflika died at his home in Zéralda from cardiac arrest at the age of 84. 
His death was announced by a statement from the office of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune. He had been in failing health since he had a stroke in 2013. President Tebboune declared three days of national mourning after his death. He was buried at the El Alia Cemetery on 19 September in a subdued ceremony.

==Criticism==
Bouteflika&#x27;s rule was marred by allegations of fraud and vote-tampering at elections from 1999 to 2019. He had already been convicted in 1983 of corruption. Per Suisse secrets he held an account, during much of his presidency with a maximum balance worth over 1.4 million Swiss francs ($1.1 million) along with other family members.

<doc id="385661" wikidata="Q11639409" url="?curid=385661" title="Inverse scattering problem">
<text>In mathematics and physics, the inverse scattering problem is the problem of determining characteristics of an object, based on data of how it scatters incoming radiation or particles. It is the inverse problem to the direct scattering problem, which is to determine how radiation or particles are scattered based on the properties of the scatterer.

Soliton equations are a class of partial differential equations which can be studied and solved by a method called the inverse scattering transform, which reduces the nonlinear PDEs to a linear inverse scattering problem. The nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the Korteweg–de Vries equation and the KP equation are examples of soliton equations. In one space dimension the inverse scattering problem is equivalent to a Riemann-Hilbert problem. Inverse scattering has been applied to many problems including radiolocation, echolocation, geophysical survey, nondestructive testing, medical imaging, and quantum field theory.

<text>The Workers International to Rebuild the Fourth International (WIRFI) was a Trotskyist international organisation. It was established in the United Kingdom in 1990, following a split from the Workers Revolutionary Party. It was considered part of the radical branch of Trotskyism, and was led by Bob Archer. It ceased operation in 2015.

==History==
In 1985 the Workers Revolutionary Party (UK) (WRP) underwent a fragmentation which split the organization apart after the ousting of its leader, Gerry Healy. Initially the organization split into two: with the WRP remaining under the leadership of Sheila Torrence and a splinter group attached to the &quot;Workers Press&quot; being led by Cliff Slaughter. Infighting continued to divide and fracture these groups, and ultimately, seven new organizations formed out of this split, one of which was the Workers International to Rebuild the Fourth International (WIRFI). 

The WIRFI was founded in 1990 under the leadership of Bob Archer. The prominent British economist Geoff Pilling was one of the organization&#x27;s founding members, and Dot Gibson served as the secretary of the organization. The WIRFI initially had support in the Workers Revolutionary Party (Namibia) and a South African section which renamed itself WIRFI and took part in the historic 1994 South African general election after the end of apartheid. The majority of the South African section left the international in 1996 and renamed itself the Workers International Vanguard League. The organization published the online periodical, the &quot;Journal of the Workers International to Rebuild the Fourth International&quot;.

In Britain, the group&#x27;s supporters were active in the Socialist Alliance and then the Democracy Platform of that grouping. By 2004 they had also become involved with the Liverpool-based Campaign for a Mass Workers Party and its offshoot, the United Socialist Party. The organization disbanded in 2015.

<text>Lemar-Aftaab is an Afghan independent weekly magazine that focuses on the culture and politics of Afghanistan. Compared to other publications in the country, &quot;Aftaab&quot; has a secular bent and has drawn criticism from conservative Islamic scholars.

== Ban ==
In June 2003, the magazine was banned by the Afghan government because several articles on Islam were deemed to be sacrilegious. The editor of the magazine, Mir Hussein Mehdavi, was arrested by the authorities and charged with blasphemy. He was later ordered to be released but may still stand trial.

<text>The California Bowl (later the California Raisin Bowl) was a post-season college football bowl game played annually at Bulldog Stadium in Fresno, California, from 1981 to 1991. The game featured the champions of the Big West Conference (known prior to 1988 as the Pacific Coast Athletic Association) and the Mid-American Conference.

In 1988, the California Raisin Advisory Board purchased the naming rights to the bowl.

The game was dealt a severe blow in 1992 when Fresno State moved to the Western Athletic Conference. The MAC and Big West then moved their tie-ins to Las Vegas, Nevada and created the Las Vegas Bowl. The California Bowl made plans to hold the 1992 game without tie-ins, but was unable to find a new sponsor. When organizers came up short of a $1.75 million fundraising goal, the NCAA pulled the bowl&#x27;s certification. It has never returned.

==Game results==
&quot;* &quot;UNLV won this game, but subsequently forfeited its entire schedule due to the use of ineligible players earlier in the season.&quot;

<text>Paul Marie Théodore Vincent d&#x27;Indy (; 27 March 18512 December 1931) was a French composer and teacher. His influence as a teacher, in particular, was considerable. He was a co-founder of the Schola Cantorum de Paris and also taught at the Paris Conservatoire. His students included Albéric Magnard, Albert Roussel, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud, Yvonne Rokseth, and Erik Satie, as well as Cole Porter.

D&#x27;Indy studied under composer César Franck, and was strongly influenced by Franck&#x27;s admiration for German music. At a time when nationalist feelings were high in both countries (circa the Franco-Prussian War of 1871), this brought Franck into conflict with other musicians who wished to separate French music from German influence.

==Life==
Paul Marie Théodore Vincent d&#x27;Indy was born in Paris into an aristocratic family of royalist and Catholic persuasion. His great-grandfather was the politician . He had piano lessons from an early age from his paternal grandmother, who passed him on to Antoine François Marmontel and Louis Diémer.

From the age of 14 d&#x27;Indy studied harmony with Albert Lavignac. When he was 16 an uncle introduced him to Berlioz&#x27;s treatise on orchestration, which inspired him to become a composer. He wrote a piano quartet which he sent to César Franck, who was the teacher of a friend. Franck recognised his talent and recommended that d&#x27;Indy pursue a career as a composer.

At the age of 19, during the Franco-Prussian War, d&#x27;Indy enlisted in the National Guard, but returned to musical life as soon as the hostilities were over. He entered Franck&#x27;s organ class at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1871 remaining there until 1875, when he joined the percussion section of the orchestra at the Châtelet Theatre to gain practical experience. He also served as chorus-master to the Concerts Colonne.

The first of his works he heard performed was a &quot;Symphonie italienne&quot;, at an orchestral rehearsal under Jules Pasdeloup; the work was admired by Georges Bizet and Jules Massenet, with whom he had already become acquainted.

During the summer of 1873 he visited Germany, where he met Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms. On 25 January 1874, his overture &quot;Les Piccolomini&quot; was performed at a Pasdeloup concert, sandwiched between works by Bach and Beethoven. Around this time he married Isabelle de Pampelonne, one of his cousins. In 1875 his symphony dedicated to János Hunyadi was performed. That same year he played a minor role – the prompter – at the premiere of Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot;. In 1876 he was present at the first production of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle at Bayreuth. This made a great impression on him and he became a fervent Wagnerian.

In 1878 d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s symphonic ballad &quot;La Forêt enchantée&quot; was performed. In 1882 he heard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;. In 1883 his choral work &quot;Le Chant de la cloche&quot; appeared. In 1884 his symphonic poem &quot;Saugefleurie&quot; was premiered. His piano suite (&quot;symphonic poem for piano&quot;) called &quot;Poème des montagnes&quot; came from around this time. In 1887 appeared his Suite in D for trumpet, 2 flutes and string quartet. That same year he was involved in Lamoureux&#x27;s production of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; as choirmaster. His music drama &quot;Fervaal&quot; occupied him between 1889 and 1895.

Inspired by his studies with Franck and yet dissatisfied with the standard of teaching at the Conservatoire, d&#x27;Indy, together with Charles Bordes and Alexandre Guilmant, founded the Schola Cantorum de Paris in 1894. D&#x27;Indy taught there until his death, becoming principal in 1904. Of the teaching at the Schola Cantorum, &quot;The Oxford Companion to Music&quot; says, &quot;A solid grounding in technique was encouraged, rather than originality&quot;, and comments that few graduates could stand comparison with the best Conservatoire students. D&#x27;Indy later taught at the Conservatoire and privately, while retaining his post at the Schola Cantorum.

Among d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s renowned pupils were Albéric Magnard, Albert Roussel, Joseph Canteloube (who later wrote d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s biography), Celia Torra, Arthur Honegger and Darius Milhaud. Two atypical students were Cole Porter, who signed up for a two-year course at the Schola, but left after a few months, and Erik Satie, who studied there for three years and later wrote, &quot;Why on earth had I gone to d&#x27;Indy? The things I had written before were so full of charm. And now? What nonsense! What dullness!&quot; Nonetheless, according to &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s influence as a teacher was &quot;enormous and wide-ranging, with benefits for French music far outweighing the charges of dogmatism and political intolerance&quot;.

D&#x27;Indy played an important part in the history of the Société nationale de musique, of which his teacher, Franck, had been a founding member in 1871. Like Franck, d&#x27;Indy revered German music, and he resented the society&#x27;s exclusion of non-French music and composers. He became the society&#x27;s joint secretary in 1885, and succeeded in overturning its French-only rule the following year. The founders of the society, Romain Bussine and Camille Saint-Saëns resigned in protest. Franck refused the formal title of president of the society, but when he died in 1890, d&#x27;Indy took the post. His regime, however, alienated a younger generation of French composers, who, led by Maurice Ravel, founded the breakaway Société musicale indépendante in 1910, which attracted leading young composers from France and other countries. In an attempt to further a proposed merger of the two organisations during the First World War d&#x27;Indy stepped down as president of the Société nationale to make way for the more &quot;progressive&quot; Gabriel Fauré, but the plan came to nothing.

According to the biographer Robert Orledge, the death of d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s first wife in 1905 removed the stabilising influence in the composer&#x27;s life, and he became &quot;increasingly vulnerable to politically motivated attacks on the Schola Cantorum and apprehensive of dangerously decadent trends in contemporary music in both France and Germany&quot;. His aesthetic ideas, Orledge argues, became &quot;increasingly reactionary and dogmatic&quot; and his political views right-wing and anti-Semitic. He joined the Ligue de la patrie française (League of the French Fatherland) during the Dreyfus affair.

During the First World War d&#x27;Indy served on cultural missions to allied countries, and completed his third music drama, &quot;La Légende de Saint-Christophe&quot;, in Orledge&#x27;s view &quot;a celebration of traditional Catholic regionalism as opposed to modern liberal democracy and capitalist values&quot;. After the war he increased his activities as a conductor, giving concert tours throughout Europe and the US. 1920 he married the much younger Caroline Janson; Orledge writes that this &quot;brought a true creative rebirth, witnessed in the serene Mediterranean-inspired compositions of his final decade&quot;.

D&#x27;Indy died on 2 December 1931 in his native Paris, aged 80, and was buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery.

==Works==

Few of d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s works are performed regularly in concert halls today. &quot;Grove&quot; comments that his famed veneration for Beethoven and Franck &quot;has unfortunately obscured the individual character of his own compositions, particularly his fine orchestral pieces descriptive of southern France&quot;. Among his best known pieces are the &quot;Symphony on a French Mountain Air&quot; for piano and orchestra (1886), and &quot;Istar&quot; (1896), a symphonic poem in the form of a set of variations in which the theme appears only at the end.

Among d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s other works are more orchestral pieces, including a Symphony in B, a vast symphonic poem, &quot;Jour d&#x27;été à la montagne&quot;, and another, &quot;Souvenirs&quot;, written on the death of his first wife. &quot;The Times&quot; said of his music that the influence of Berlioz, Franck, and Wagner is strong in almost all his work, &quot;that of Franck showing itself chiefly in the shapes of his tunes, that of Wagner in their development, and that of Berlioz in their orchestration&quot;.

&quot;Grove&quot; says of his chamber works: &quot;D&#x27;Indy&#x27;s somewhat academic corpus of chamber music (including three completed string quartets) is generally less interesting than his orchestral works&quot;. He also wrote piano music (including a Sonata in E minor), songs and a number of operas, including &quot;Fervaal&quot; (1897) and &quot;L&#x27;Étranger&quot; (1902). His music drama &quot;Le Légende de Saint Christophe&quot;, based on themes from Gregorian chant, was premiered at the Paris Opéra on 6 June 1920.

D&#x27;Indy helped revive a number of then largely forgotten Baroque works, for example making his own edition of Monteverdi&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;. D&#x27;Indy also contributed to the incipient revival of the works of Antonio Vivaldi, whose sonatas for cello and basso continuo (op. 14) were edited by d&#x27;Indy as cello concerti and published by Maurice Senart in 1922. His musical writings include the three-volume &quot;Cours de composition musicale&quot; as well as studies of Franck and Beethoven. &quot;The Times&quot; commented that his study of the former was &quot;one of the most vivid and individual of modern French biographies&quot;, and the latter, published in 1912, showed &quot;the closeness of the lifelong study which he devoted to that master&quot;.

==Commemorations==
The private music college École de musique Vincent-d&#x27;Indy in Montreal, Canada, is named after the composer, as is the asteroid 11530 d&#x27;Indy, discovered in 1992.

<doc id="385669" wikidata="Q5025901" url="?curid=385669" title="Camellia Bowl (1961–1980)">
<text>The Camellia Bowl was an annual college football postseason game in Sacramento, California, which is nicknamed the &quot;Camellia City&quot;. It was held sixteen times at Hughes Stadium, from 1961 through 1975, and once more in 1980.

==History==
The Camellia Bowl was founded in March 1961, when the Sacramento City-County Chamber of Commerce voted unanimously to accept an offer from the National Association for Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) to move its championship game to the city. For the previous four years, the game had been known as the Holiday Bowl and was played in Saint Petersburg, Florida. The Camellia Bowl served as the NAIA Football National Championship game for three years.

After the transition from NAIA to NCAA affiliation, announced in January 1964, the game became one of four regional finals in the NCAA College Division. At the time, there were no playoffs at any level of NCAA football. For the smaller colleges and universities, as for the major programs, the national champion was determined by polls conducted by the leading news wire services. The intent of the bowl was to match the two best non-major teams from a region consisting of the Pacific Coast and Rocky Mountain states. The other three regional finals were the Tangerine (later Boardwalk), Pecan (later Pioneer), and Grantland Rice bowls.

When the College Division was subdivided into the current Division II and Division III in 1973, the NCAA made the Camellia Bowl the Division II football championship game. It served in this capacity for three seasons (1973 to 1975). After a four-year hiatus, the bowl returned in 1980 as the NCAA Division I-AA title game.

Sacramento&#x27;s Camellia Bowl Association signed a two-year deal to host the Division I-AA championship, but after the 1980 game drew just 8,157 fans and lost $21,659, game organizers appealed to the NCAA to cancel the contract. The NCAA agreed, and the I-AA title game was moved to the Pioneer Bowl in Wichita Falls, Texas, for 1981.

<text>Rahim Nizar Jaffer (; born 15 December 1971) is a former Canadian politician. He served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2008, representing the Alberta riding of Edmonton—Strathcona as a member of the Conservative Party. He was the first Muslim elected to the Canadian Parliament. Jaffer became embroiled in a national controversy in 2010 after he appeared to receive &quot;a break&quot; from the justice system after being charged with drunk driving and possession of cocaine.

==Early life==
Jaffer is an Ismaili Muslim of Indian Gujarati descent. While young, Jaffer and his family emigrated to Canada to escape further persecution in Uganda after the government of Idi Amin confiscated their business and their home. They settled in Edmonton.

Jaffer completed a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Ottawa in political science and economics. He took his degree in the French language. He also served as a legislative assistant in the House of Commons. After completing his degree he returned to Edmonton, where he operated a successful coffee shop in the heart of the Old Strathcona district.

==Political career==
Jaffer was elected to the House of Commons as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Edmonton—Strathcona in the federal election on June 2, 1997, at the age of 25. He won the seat as a member of the Reform Party of Canada (later the Canadian Alliance, which later merged with the Progressive Conservatives to form the Conservative Party). Jaffer was re-elected in 2000.

In 2001, Matthew Johnston, an aide to Jaffer, impersonated him during a radio interview that Jaffer was himself unable to attend. Jaffer subsequently apologized for the stunt in the House of Commons and was suspended from his caucus position for several months. The incident was parodied by &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, Rick Mercer performed a rap based on Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, with the lyrics &quot;Will the real Rahim Jaffer please stand up?&quot;

In the 2006 election, Jaffer was re-elected to serve a fourth term as the Member of Parliament for Edmonton—Strathcona. On 8 February 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper named him chair of the Conservative caucus.

Jaffer lost his seat in the 2008 election after he was defeated by New Democrat Linda Duncan. Jaffer was initially reluctant to concede defeat but finally did so on 16 October after the results were officially validated by the riding returning officer.

In 2009, Jaffer expressed interest in re-seeking the Conservative nomination for Edmonton—Strathcona at the next election. However, he declined to do so after it was claimed that he was shut out of nomination process.

Jaffer was once voted &quot;laziest MP&quot; in an annual survey by &quot;The Hill Times&quot;.

==Personal life==
On 15 October 2008, Jaffer married his former caucus colleague Helena Guergis, by then a Cabinet minister. This was her second marriage and his first.

Jaffer and Guergis became engaged in October 2007. Reportedly at the initiative of Guergis, the couple decided on the morning after the election to scrap their planned wedding date and to get married immediately. Their wedding was presided over by Ian McClelland, a former Member of Parliament and a licensed marriage commissioner, later that same day at McClelland&#x27;s home. The marriage was witnessed by the couple&#x27;s parliamentary colleague James Rajotte and by one of Jaffer&#x27;s cousins. In December 2010, the couple had a boy.

===Arrest and conviction===
On 11 September 2009, Jaffer was stopped late at night by the Ontario Provincial Police while he was traveling at a rate of 93 km/h in a 50 km/h zone in Palgrave, Ontario, located close to his wife&#x27;s riding. The officer noticed a smell of alcohol on Jaffer&#x27;s breath, and after administering a breathalyzer test, found him to be over the Ontario legal blood-alcohol limit of .08. Jaffer&#x27;s driver&#x27;s licence was suspended for 90 days, and he was charged with drunk driving and possession of an undisclosed quantity of cocaine. The location of the cocaine was a source of contention between police and Jaffer. The arresting officer stated that the drugs were found in Jaffer&#x27;s pants pocket, whereas Jaffer&#x27;s defense team claimed it was in his suit jacket. Earlier in the evening, he had met in Toronto with Nazim Gillani, a businessman. Gillani claimed he was a banker for the Hells Angels.

Jaffer was initially scheduled to appear in court in Orangeville, Ontario on 19 October 2009. During the 2008 election, Jaffer&#x27;s campaign approved radio ads accusing NDP leader Jack Layton of being soft on marijuana use. On 9 March 2010, Jaffer pleaded guilty to one charge of careless driving and was sentenced to a fine of $500. The cocaine possession and drunk driving charges were withdrawn. Justice Doug Maund told Jaffer &quot;I’m sure you can recognize a break when you see one.&quot; The sentence and the dropping of the more serious charges triggered outrage across Canada, as well as more extensive investigation of events leading up to the incident prompting the arrest, which led to allegations several escorts also attended his dinner with Mr Gillani.

<doc id="385677" wikidata="Q215350" url="?curid=385677" title="Forza Italia">
<text> (FI; ) was a centre-right liberal-conservative political party in Italy, with Christian democratic, liberal (especially economic liberalism), social democratic and populist tendencies. It was founded by Silvio Berlusconi, who served as Prime Minister of Italy four times.

The party was founded in December 1993 and won its first general election soon afterwards in March 1994. It was the main member of the Pole of Freedoms/Pole of Good Government, Pole for Freedoms and House of Freedoms coalitions. Throughout its existence, the party was characterised by a strong reliance on the personal image and charisma of its leader (it has been called a &quot;personality party&quot; or Berlusconi&#x27;s &quot;personal party&quot;), and the skillful use of media campaigns, especially via television. The party&#x27;s organisation and ideology depended heavily on its leader, so much so that its appeal to voters was based on Berlusconi&#x27;s personality more than on its ideology or programme.

In November 2008, the national council of the party, presided by Alfredo Biondi, voted to merge Forza Italia into The People of Freedom (PdL), Berlusconi&#x27;s new political vehicle, whose official foundation took place in March 2009. A new Forza Italia was established by Berlusconi as PdL&#x27;s legal successor in 2013.

== History ==
=== Foundation (1993–1994) ===

Forza Italia was formed in 1993 by Silvio Berlusconi, a successful businessman and owner of four of the main private television stations in Italy, along with Antonio Martino, , Antonio Tajani, Marcello Dell&#x27;Utri, Cesare Previti and Giuliano Urbani.

Italy was shaken by a series of corruption scandals known as &quot;Tangentopoli&quot; and the subsequent police investigation, called &quot;Mani pulite&quot;. This led to the disappearance of the five parties which governed Italy from 1947: DC, PSI, PSDI, PLI and PRI (they formed a successful five-party coalition called &quot;Pentapartito&quot; from 1983 to 1991, and then governed without PRI from 1991 to 1994) and to the end of the so-called First Republic.

Forza Italia&#x27;s aim was to attract moderate voters who were &quot;disoriented, political orphans and who risked being unrepresented&quot; (as Berlusconi described them), especially if the Democratic Party of the Left (the direct heirs of the Italian Communist Party) had been able to win the next election and enter in government for the first time since 1947.

The establishment of Forza Italia was supported in terms of finance, personnel and logistics by Berlusconi&#x27;s Fininvest corporation: The area managers of its advertisement branch &quot;Publitalia &#x27;80&quot; (managed by Dell&#x27;Utri) organised the selection of FI candidates, its marketing network staffed the opinion research centre &quot;Diakron&quot; that surveyed the &quot;market potential&quot; of the new party and the financial intermediaries of Fininvest subsidiary &quot;Programma Italia&quot; encouraged the launch of Forza Italia clubs. The new party&#x27;s campaigning was strongly dependent on Fininvest&#x27;s TV stations and PR resources. This earned Forza Italia labels like &quot;virtual&quot;, &quot;plastic&quot; or &quot;business-firm party&quot;. In her 2001 study of the party, political scientist Emanuela Poli described Forza Italia as &quot;a mere diversification of Fininvest in the political market&quot;. The case of Forza Italia was unprecedented as never before had a large political party been launched by a business corporation. Only slowly it transformed into a mass-membership organisation. It took four years until the first party congress was held. To extend its representation in different regions, FI often recruited established politicians of the &quot;old&quot; parties, mainly DC and PSI, who defected to the new party, bringing their local clientele with them.

FI&#x27;s political programme was strongly influenced by the manifesto &quot;In Search of Good Government&quot; &quot;(Alla ricerca del buongoverno)&quot; authored in late 1993 by Giuliano Urbani who was then a political science professor at Milan&#x27;s private Bocconi University and an occasional collaborator of Fininvest. It denounced corruption, dominance of political parties and remnants of communism as Italy&#x27;s ills, while advocating market economy, the assertion of civil society and more efficient politics as the solutions. In a couple of months Forza Italia became one of the leading Italian parties, achieving a large consensus through an accurate strategy of communication and pounding electoral spots aired by the Mediaset TV channels.

=== A short stint in power (1994–1995) ===

A few months after its creation, Forza Italia came to national power after the 1994 general election as the head of a political coalition called Pole of Freedoms/Pole of Good Government, composed of Lega Nord, National Alliance, Christian Democratic Centre and Union of the Centre.

Silvio Berlusconi was sworn in May 1994 as Prime Minister of Italy in a government in which the most important cabinet posts were held by fellow Forza Italia members: Antonio Martino was
Foreign Minister, Cesare Previti Defence Minister, Alfredo Biondi Justice Minister and Giulio Tremonti (at the time an independent member of Parliament) Finance Minister.

In the 1994 European Parliament election held in June, Forza Italia was placed first nationally, with 30.6% of the vote, electing 27 MEPs. The party did not join an existing group in the European Parliament, instead forming the new group Forza Europa, composed entirely of Forza Italia MEPs.

The first Berlusconi-led government had a short life and fell in December, when Lega Nord left the coalition, after disagreements over pension reform and the first &quot;avviso di garanzia&quot; (preliminary notice of an investigation) for Berlusconi, passed by Milan prosecutors. Forza Italia&#x27;s leader was replaced as prime minister by Lamberto Dini, an independent politician who had been the administration&#x27;s Treasury Minister. No members of Forza Italia joined the new government and the party leader was relegated to opposition. However, the party obtained substantial successes in the 1995 Italian regional elections, both in the North (winning in Piedmont, Lombardy and Veneto) and the South (Campania, Apulia and Calabria).

=== Five years of opposition (1996–2001) ===
In 1996 the Pole for Freedoms coalition led by Forza Italia lost that year&#x27;s general election and began what Berlusconi called &quot;the crossing of the desert&quot;, something that could have proved fatal for such a young and unstructured party. Between 1996 and 1998, the party started to strengthen its organisation under Claudio Scajola, a former Christian Democrat who served as national coordinator of Forza Italia from 1996 to 2001.

In December 1999, Forza Italia gained full membership in the European People&#x27;s Party, of which Antonio Tajani, the party leader of Forza Italia in the European Parliament, became a Vice President. In the same year, the party scored well (25.2% of votes) in the European Parliament election of 1999.

In the Italian regional elections of 2000, the Pole for Freedoms, with the support of Lega Nord, won in eight out of fifteen regions (all the most populous ones, except for Campania), while three members of Forza Italia were re-elected as presidents of the Region in Piedmont (Enzo Ghigo), Lombardy (Roberto Formigoni), and Veneto (Giancarlo Galan), together with three more elected for the first time in Liguria (Sandro Biasotti), Apulia (Raffaele Fitto) and Calabria (Giuseppe Chiaravalloti).

The party regained power in the general election of 2001, gaining 29.4% of the votes with Giorgio La Malfa&#x27;s tiny Italian Republican Party, in a new coalition called House of Freedoms (CdL) and composed mainly of the National Alliance, Lega Nord, Christian Democratic Centre and United Christian Democrats (the last two parties merged in 2002 to form the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, UDC).

=== Five years in government (2001–2006) ===

In June 2001, after the huge success in May elections, Silvio Berlusconi was returned head of the Italian government, the longest-serving cabinet in the history of the Italian republic. Again all key ministerial posts were given to Forza Italia members: Interior (Claudio Scajola 2001–2002, Giuseppe Pisanu 2002–2006), Defence (Antonio Martino 2001–2006), Finance (Giulio Tremonti, 2001–2004 and 2005–2006), Industry (Antonio Marzano 2001–2005, Claudio Scajola 2005–2006) and Foreign Affairs (Franco Frattini, 2002–2004). Additionally, National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini was appointed deputy prime minister and foreign minister from 2004 to 2006, while Roberto Castelli, senior figure of Lega Nord was Justice Minister from 2001 to 2006.

In 2004 European elections, Forza Italia was second place nationally, receiving 20.1% of the vote and returning 16 MEPs.

In national office, the government&#x27;s popularity kept declining steadily year after year. Regional elections in April 2005 were a serious blow for the party, which however remained strong in the northern regions, such as Lombardy and Veneto, and somewhere in the South, where Sicily was a stronghold. After this disappointing electoral performance the cabinet was reshuffled, due to the insistence of the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats&#x27;s leaders, and Berlusconi formed his third cabinet.

During his five years in office, Berlusconi government passed a series of reforms: a pension system reform, a labour market reform, a judiciary reform and a constitutional reform – the latter rejected by a referendum in June 2006. In foreign policy he shifted the country&#x27;s position to more closeness to the United States, while in economic policy he was not able to deliver the tax cuts he had openly promised throughout all 2001 electoral campaign.

=== Toward The People of Freedom (2006–2009) ===

In the 2006 general election the party was present with a slightly different logo, with the words &quot;Berlusconi President&quot; (&quot;Berlusconi Presidente&quot;). It was the only party to use the word &quot;President&quot; in its logo. In the election for the Chamber of Deputies, FI scored 23.7% and 137 seats, in those for the Senate 24.0%, without counting Trentino-Alto Adige, whose seats were contested on first-past-the-post basis and which is a left-wing stronghold, due to its alliance with the autonomist South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party). The incumbent Berlusconi-led government narrowly lost to The Union coalition, which returned Romano Prodi as prime minister, relegating Forza Italia and its House of Freedoms allies to opposition.

On 31 July 2007 Berlusconi&#x27;s protegee and possible successor Michela Vittoria Brambilla registered the name and the logo of the &quot;Freedom Party&quot; (&quot;Partito della Libertà&quot;) apparently with Berlusconi&#x27;s backing. On 18 November, after Forza Italia claimed to have collected the signatures of more than 7 million Italians (including Umberto Bossi) against Romano Prodi&#x27;s second government to ask the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano to call a fresh election, Berlusconi announced that Forza Italia would have soon merged or transformed into The People of Freedom (PdL) party.

After the sudden fall of the Prodi II Cabinet on 24 January 2008, the break-up of The Union coalition and the subsequent political crisis paving the way towards a new general election, Berlusconi hinted on 25 January that Forza Italia would have probably contested its final election and the new party would have been officially founded after that election. In an atmosphere of reconciliation with Gianfranco Fini, Berlusconi also stated that the new party could have seen the participation of other parties. Finally, on 8 February, Berlusconi and Fini agreed to form a joint list under the banner of &quot;The People of Freedom&quot;, allied with Lega Nord. In the 2008 general election the PdL won 37.4% and a majority in both chambers, thanks to the alliance with Lega Nord (8.3%). Soon after the election Berlusconi formed his fourth government.

On 21 November 2008 the national council of the party, presided over by Alfredo Biondi and attended by Berlusconi himself, officially decided the dissolution of Forza Italia into The People of Freedom (PdL), whose official foundation took place on 27 March 2009.

=== Revival (2013) ===

In June 2013 Berlusconi announced the upcoming revival of Forza Italia, and the transformation of the People of Freedom into a centre-right coalition. The modern-day Forza Italia was launched on 18 September 2013 and the PdL was dissolved into the new party on 16 November 2013.

== Ideology ==

Forza Italia was a centre-right party, formed mainly by former members of Christian Democracy, the Italian Socialist Party and the Italian Liberal Party. The ideology of the party ranged from libertarianism to social democracy (often referred to as &quot;liberal socialism&quot; in Italy), including elements of the Catholic social teaching and the social market economy. The party was a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and presented itself as the party of renewal and modernization. The core values of Forza Italia were &quot;freedom&quot; and the &quot;centrality of the individual&quot;. From a comparative perspective the ideology of Forza Italia has been characterized as liberal conservative, or conservative liberal, national conservative, and liberal.
Alessandro Campi has written that &quot;the political culture of Forza Italia – a curious and, on many respects, untold mixture of &#x27;liberalism&#x27; and &#x27;democratic populism&#x27; – deserves to be described as an &#x27;anti-ideological ideology&#x27;, ... as a synthesis or fusion of very diverse political families and traditions (from liberal Catholicism to social conservatism, from reformist socialism to economic liberalism), kept together by the mobilizing appeal to &#x27;freedom&#x27;.&quot; Chiara Moroni, who explains Forza Italia&#x27;s ideology as a mixture of liberal, Christian-democratic and social-democratic values (united in the concept of &quot;popular liberalism&quot; in party documents), wrote that &quot;Berlusconi offered to voters liberal values through a populist style&quot; and that &quot;Forza Italia has made the liberal political ideal popular&quot; among voters, so that &quot;it was spread and shared by broad and heterogenous sectors of the Italian population&quot;.

The electoral base of Forza Italia was highly heterogeneous and the ideological differences among its voters are explained also by its different regional constituencies; while voters from the North tended to support the original libertarian line of the party, voters from the South tended to be more statist. Both its Northern strongholds (Lombardy and Veneto) and its Southern strongholds (Sicily and Apulia) were once dominated by the Christian Democracy party; while in the South most leading members of Forza Italia are former Christian Democrats, the party was highly influenced also by liberals in the North.

Forza Italia claimed to be a fresh new party, with no ties with the last governments of the so-called First Republic, and at the same time to be the heir of the best political traditions of Italy: Christian Democrat Alcide De Gasperi, Social Democrat Giuseppe Saragat, Liberal Luigi Einaudi and Republican Ugo La Malfa were considered as party icons.

The &quot;Secular Creed&quot;, that was also the preamble to the party&#x27;s constitution, described the party in this way: 

Forza Italia presented itself as a bridge between Catholics and non-Catholics, who have been previously divided in the political system of the First Republic, and &quot;the union of three political-cultural areas: that of liberal and popular Catholicism, that of secular, liberal and republican humanism and that of liberal socialism&quot;. In a speech during a party congress in 1998, Berlusconi himself proclaimed: &quot;our liberal vision of the State is perfectly in agreement with the Catholic social teaching&quot;.

The &quot;Secular Creed&quot; of the party explains that FI was a party that primarily underlined freedom and the centrality of the individual, which are basic principles of both liberalism and the Catholic social teaching, often connected in party official documents: 

In 2008 Berlusconi stated that:
Sandro Bondi, a leading member of the party, wrote:

The party included also non-Catholic members, but they were a minority, and it was less secular in its policies than Christian Democratic Union of Germany. The party usually gave to its members freedom of conscience on moral issues (and hence a free vote), as in the case of the referendum on stem-cell research, but leading members of the party, including Silvio Berlusconi, Giulio Tremonti and Marcello Pera (who is himself non-Catholic, although friend of Pope Benedict XVI), spoke in favour of &quot;abstention&quot; (as asked by the Catholic Church, to not surpass the 50% of turnout needed for making the referendum legally binding). While Pera campaigned hard for the success of the boycott along with most FI members, both Berlusconi and Tremonti explicitly said that &quot;abstention&quot; was their personal opinion, not the official one of the party.

The political scientist Giovanni Orsina has defined &quot;Berlusconism&quot;, as he terms the ideology of Forza Italia and its leader, as an &quot;emulsion of populism and liberalism&quot;, more specifically right-liberalism. According to him, in the initial phase, both elements were represented about equally, only after 2000 pro-market liberal positions had receded in favour of more socially conservative ones. As the main ideologic themes of &quot;Berlusconism&quot;, Orsina identified the myth of the &quot;good&quot; civil society (as opposed to the state apparatus), a &quot;friendly, minimal state&quot; (providing services to citizens rather than regulating their lives), &quot;hypopolitics&quot; (i.e. the containment of political conflicts, after the hyper-politisation of Italian society during the &quot;First Republic&quot;) and the identification of a &quot;new virtuous elite&quot;. The concepts of a good civil society and hypopolitics were both liberal and populist; while the minimal state was a mainly liberal idea and the new virtuous elite a chiefly populist one. According to Orsina, &quot;Berlusconism&quot; sanctified &quot;the people&quot; that embodied all virtues while being &quot;betrayed&quot; by the (old) elites, a typical element of populist ideologies. However, Berlusconi viewed &quot;the people&quot; as a pluralistic and diverse collection of individuals, not an ethnically, historically and culturally homogeneous unit.

== Members ==

Most members of the party were former Christian Democrats (DC): Giuseppe Pisanu (former member of the leftist faction of DC and Minister of Interior), Roberto Formigoni (President of Lombardy), Claudio Scajola (former Minister of the Interior and of Industry), Enrico La Loggia, Renato Schifani, Guido Crosetto, Raffaele Fitto, Giuseppe Gargani, Alfredo Antoniozzi, Giorgio Carollo, Giuseppe Castiglione, Francesco Giro, Luigi Grillo, Maurizio Lupi, Mario Mantovani, Mario Mauro, Osvaldo Napoli, Antonio Palmieri, Angelo Sanza, Riccardo Ventre and Marcello Vernola are only some remarkable examples.

Several members were former Socialists (PSI), as Giulio Tremonti (vice-president of the party and former Minister of Economy), Franco Frattini (Vice President of the European Commission), Fabrizio Cicchitto (national deputy-coordinator of the party), Renato Brunetta, Francesco Musotto, Amalia Sartori, Paolo Guzzanti and Margherita Boniver. Berlusconi himself was a close friend of Bettino Craxi, leader of the PSI, in spite of his own Christian Democratic and Liberal background (Berlusconi was a DC activist in occasion of the 1948 general election).

Many were former Liberals (PLI), Republicans (PRI) and Social Democrats (PSDI): Alfredo Biondi (president of Forza Italia&#x27;s national council) and Raffaele Costa, both former PLI leaders, and former PSDI leader Carlo Vizzini were later MPs for Forza Italia. Also Antonio Martino and Giancarlo Galan were formers Liberals, Jas Gawronski was a leading Republican, while Marcello Pera has a Socialist and Radical background.

Even some former Communists were leading members of the party, such as national party coordinator Sandro Bondi and Ferdinando Adornato.

== Factions ==

Members of Forza Italia were divided in factions, which were sometimes mutable and formed over the most important political issues, despite previous party allegiances; however, it is possible to distinguish some patterns. The party was divided over ethical (between social conservatives and progressives), economic (between social democrats and some Christian democrats on one side and liberals on the other one), and institutional issues.

Regarding the latter issue, generally speaking, northern party members were staunch proposers of political and fiscal federalism, and autonomy for the Regions (in some parts of Veneto and Lombardy, it was sometimes difficult to distinguish a member of FI from a member of the LN), while those coming from the South were more cold on the issue. Also some former Liberals, due to their role of unifiers of Italy in the 19th century, were more centralist.

A scheme of the internal factions within Forza Italia could be this:
* Liberals. Supporters of free markets, deregulation, economic freedoms, civil rights and, in general, personal responsibility and freedom. This group was basically formed by two wings: classical liberals (former members of the Italian Liberal Party, most of them organised in Popular Liberalism, as Alfredo Biondi, Raffaele Costa, Egidio Sterpa and Enrico Nan); former Socialists, as Renato Brunetta and Paolo Guzzanti; others like Stefania Prestigiacomo and Simone Baldelli) and libertarians, as Antonio Martino (ex-PLI), Dario Rivolta, Benedetto Della Vedova (ex-Radical) and his Liberal Reformers. The latter were more staunchly pro-United States than the former and supported the idea of transforming Italy into a federal State.
* Liberal-centrists. They were more moderate than Martino and Della Vedova on economic issues, and more socially conservative on ethical issues, although not being totally sided with the Catholic Church. To this broad group belonged people of various origin: former Socialists (as Giulio Tremonti, Franco Frattini, Giampiero Cantoni, Amalia Sartori and Jole Santelli), former Republicans (as Luigi Casero, Denis Verdini and Donato Bruno), former Liberals (as Giancarlo Galan, Giuseppe Vegas and Paolo Romani), some former liberal Christian Democrats (Giuseppe Cossiga and Basilio Germanà) and many others (as Giorgio Jannone, Antonio Leone, Gianfranco Micciché and Aldo Brancher). They were strong in Northern Italy and strong supporters of political and fiscal federalism.
* Christian democrats. They believed in the social market economy model and were supporters of Catholic stances over ethical issues. Most former members of Christian Democracy were identifiable with this tendency (from Roberto Formigoni to Giuseppe Pisanu, from Claudio Scajola to Enrico La Loggia, from Guido Crosetto to Angelo Sanza, from Maurizio Lupi to Giuseppe Gargani, from Antonio Palmieri to Mario Mantovani), but also ex-Communists, such as Sandro Bondi and Fernando Adornato, and an ex-Socialist as Gianni Baget Bozzo, a Catholic priest who was in charge of cultural formation, fitted the category, along with former Liberals, as Isabella Bertolini. Some were more socially conservative than others (for example Formigoni and theoconservatives like Marcello Pera) and many of them were close to Giulio Tremonti, indeed this group and that described before were very close on most political issues, so that the two factions were often undistinguishable. They are probably the most europeanist wing of the party, along with former Socialists, but many of them were also the most atlanticists within it, as Adornato and Pera. In 2007 Adornato, Pisanu and Formigoni launched a faction named Liberal-Popular Union, but, the faction soon was disbanded as Adornato left Forza Italia to join UDC. Formigoni had also his own group, Network Italy, mainly composed of Catholics active in Communion and Liberation, to which group both Crosetto and Fitto showed closeness.
* Social democrats. The most progressive wing of the party, especially about ethical issues. They were basically former Socialists, as Fabrizio Cicchitto, Francesco Colucci, Maurizio Sacconi, Margherita Boniver, Giorgio Stracquadanio, Chiara Moroni and Stefania Craxi, or former Social Democrats, as Carlo Vizzini, Nicola Cosentino and Paolo Russo. They considered themselves the true heirs of Pietro Nenni, Giuseppe Saragat and Bettino Craxi, continued to declare themselves &#x27;Socialists&#x27; and were sided with Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s centre-right because they saw the Italian centre-left as too hegemonised by the Democrats of the Left, heir of the Italian Communist Party, which was the harshest rival of the Italian Socialists from the Fifties to the Nineties. Forza Italia&#x27;s social democrats were organised into four sub-factions: We Blue Reformers, Free Foundation, Young Italy and the Clubs of Reformist Initiative.

Christian democrats and liberal-centrists were undoubtedly the strongest factions within the party, but all four were mainstream for a special issue: for example liberals and liberal-centrists were highly influential over economic policy, Christian democrats led the party over ethical issues (although there was a substantial minority promoting a more progressive outlook), while social democrats had their say in defining the party&#x27;s policy over labour market reform and, moreover, it is thanks to this group (and to those around Tremonti, he himself a former Socialist) that constitutional reform was at the top of Forza Italia&#x27;s political agenda. It is difficult to say to what faction Berlusconi was closer, what is sure is that his political record was a synthesis of all the political tendencies within the party.

== Internal structure ==

Before being merged into the PdL, Forza Italia had a president (currently Silvio Berlusconi), two vice-presidents (Giulio Tremonti and Roberto Formigoni), a presidential committee (presided by Claudio Scajola) and a national council (presided by Alfredo Biondi).

The president was the party&#x27;s leader, but a national coordinator was in charge of internal organisation and day-to-day political activity, similarly to the secretary-general in many European parties. Moreover, the party had thematic departments and regional, provincial or metropolitan coordination boards plus many affiliate clubs (Club Azzurro) all over Italy.

FI is considered a prototypical example of the business-firm party, in that it was strongly centered on Berlusconi, who had created the party to further his own private interests.

It has been claimed that Forza Italia had no internal democracy because there was no way of changing the leader of the party from below (although the party&#x27;s constitution makes it possible). Key posts in the party structure were appointed by Berlusconi or by his delegates. Forza Italia&#x27;s organisation was based on the idea of a &quot;party of the elected people&quot;, giving more importance to the whole electorate than to party&#x27;s members.

Party national-level conventions did not have normally elections to choose the party leadership (although the national congress elected some members of the national council), and they seemed to be more like events arranged for propaganda purposes. However, Berlusconi was highly popular among his party fellows, and it was unlikely he could have been overthrown if such an election had occurred.

Within the party there was a long debate over organisation. The original idea was the so-called &quot;light party&quot; (&quot;partito leggero&quot;), intended to be different from Italian traditional, bureaucratic and self-referential, party machines. This was the line of the early founders of the party, notably Marcello Dell&#x27;Utri and Antonio Martino. However Claudio Scajola and most former Christian Democrats supported a more capillary-based organisation, to make participate as much people as possible, and a more collegial, participative and democratic decision-making process.

In a 1999 study, political scientists Jonathan Hopkin and Caterina Paolucci likened the organisational model of the party to that of a business firm, describing it as having &quot;a lightweight organisation with the sole basic function of mobilising short-term support at election time&quot;. Several other authors have adopted this comparison, and have labeled Berlusconi as a &quot;political entrepreneur&quot;.

Given the perceived use of government responsibility to advance Berlusconi&#x27;s personal and Fininvest&#x27;s business interests during the period of Forza Italia-led government, the political scientist Patrick McCarthy in 1995 proposed to describe Forza Italia as a &quot;clan&quot; rather than a reform-minded political party. In 2004, ten years after the emergence of the party and during its second term in government, Mark Donovan summarised that this still might be an accurate description. He asserted that the party (and the centre-right camp) was only coherent and disciplined when it came to questions that strongly concerned Berlusconi, while he allowed great liberties to the diverse factions in other issues that did not concern his personal interests.

== Distinctive traits ==

From its inception, Forza Italia used unconventional means in regards to European politics. Forza Italia&#x27;s methods more closely resembled the American model, and utilized methods such as: stickering, SMS messaging, and mass-mailing of campaign material. This additionally included the widespread distribution of Berlusconi&#x27;s biography, which was titled &quot;An Italian Story&quot; (&quot;Una storia italiana&quot;).

The party was heavily dependent on the image surrounding Berlusconi&#x27;s personality. The party&#x27;s anthem was sung in karaoke fashion at American-style conventions. There was nominally no internal opposition (although some critical voices raised up, such as those of Senators Paolo Guzzanti and Raffaele Iannuzzi). The party used TV advertising extensively, although this was slightly restricted following 2000 by a law passed by the centre-left majority of the time.

== European affiliation ==
Following its first European election in 1994, Forza Italia MEPs formed their own political group in the European Parliament called Forza Europa. In 1995, Forza Europa merged with the European Democratic Alliance to form the Union for Europe group alongside the Rally for the Republic of France and Fianna Fáil of Ireland. Following an abandoned attempt to form a European political party with Rally for the Republic in 1997, on 10 June 1998 Forza Italia was accepted into the
Group of the European People&#x27;s Party. In December 1999 Forza Italia was finally granted full membership of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP).

<text>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine, Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s fifth novel, was published on April5, 1965, by Holt, Rinehart and Winston. A piece of postmodern satire, it gave context to Vonnegut&#x27;s following novel, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, and shared in its success.

==Themes and intertextuality==
Vonnegut&#x27;s fifth novel, &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;, followed a series with science-fictional subjects. This one, though it features science-fictional writing, is a postmodernist satire based on a humanistic premise. The thesis there is so blatant that the notice in &quot;The New York Times&quot; opens with the opinion that it &quot;really requires the services of a social historian rather than a book reviewer&quot;. One of its targets is the economic inequality resulting from what the book describes as the &quot;savage and stupid and entirely inappropriate and unnecessary and humorless American class system&quot;. At the center of the story is the conscience-stricken multi-millionaire Eliot Rosewater, who moves the Rosewater Foundation that he heads to the former family home in Rosewater, Indiana, &quot;where he attempts to dispense unlimited amounts of love and limited sums of money to anyone who will come to his office.&quot;

The science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout, who makes his appearance at the end of the novel and is referenced by Eliot Rosewater earlier on, defines the problem that Eliot is trying to address as &quot;How to love people who have no use&quot;. Those whom Eliot tries to assist are life&#x27;s terminal losers, unhinged by their lack of comprehension of the indifferent system that has produced them. &quot;It is in fact the thoroughly sane for whom Vonnegut reserves his disdain&quot;, according to one commentator. Another sums up Vonnegut&#x27;s intention as to expose &quot;Lust for money by despicable people whose only comic attribute is the glee with which the author has created petty indignities for them to suffer&quot;.

Several more of Vonnegut&#x27;s continuing themes come together, some for the first time, in &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;. The character Eliot Rosewater, the novel&#x27;s focus, reappears incidentally in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1969) and &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; (1973). The description of the fire-bombing of Dresden, which Eliot hallucinates as affecting Indianapolis in chapter 13, remains a master theme from now on in Vonnegut&#x27;s writing and is central to &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;. Equally a matter of history is the pornographic photograph of a woman attempting sex with a pony, given passing mention in chapter 11 of the novel and reappearing in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;. The celebrated trial of French photographer André Lefèvre for selling just such postcards took place in 1841.

The writer Kilgore Trout, Vonnegut&#x27;s foil and fictional alter-ego, appears in person for the first time in this novel as taking part in the panel that coaches Eliot back to sanity at the end. There are also summaries of five Trout novels, which are mentioned as part of Eliot&#x27;s reading. One of these is about aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, which plays a role in many Vonnegut novels. And the name Diana Moon Glampers, one of Eliot&#x27;s main clients, is that of the Handicapper General in Vonnegut&#x27;s earlier dystopic story &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot; (1961), but otherwise she is totally different from the character in &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;.

In chapter 11, the young lawyer Norman Mushari visits the Rumfoord Mansion in Newport and speaks to Lance Rumfoord. Members of that family figure in many other Vonnegut short stories and novels, notably in the earlier &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; (1959). Norman Mushari Jr., the presumed son of Norman Mushari, is found in Vonnegut&#x27;s later &quot;Slapstick&quot; (1976) where, in similar fashion, he persuades his client to seek restitution from her family for mistreatment. Both Musharis are motivated by the large cut of the profits to be gained by helping people inherit their wealth.

==Plot==
The Rosewater Foundation was founded by United States Senator Lister Ames Rosewater of Indiana to help Rosewater descendants avoid paying taxes on the family estate in Rosewater County. It is operated by a large legal firm in New York and provides an annual pension of $3.5 million to Eliot, the senator&#x27;s son.

Eliot, a World War II veteran, alcoholic, and volunteer firefighter, has developed a social conscience and sets out across America to visit various small towns before he lands in Rosewater County. Eliot does his best to help the people there, having an office in the county seat where he gets phone calls from any of the ineffectual townsfolk needing his help or reassurance, much to the displeasure of his father. Meanwhile, the only other branch of the Rosewater family is a distant cousin named Fred Rosewater living in Rhode Island, a depressed life insurance salesman who contemplates suicide every day. Fred is visited by Norman Mushari, defecting from the Rosewater Corporation&#x27;s legal team. Mushari persuades Fred that, if he can prove Eliot is insane, he can give him control of the family fortune by causing the money to pass to Fred, Eliot&#x27;s closest oldest male relative.

After his father advises him of the scheme, Eliot suffers a nervous breakdown and is confined to a mental institution for a year. He suffers a bout of amnesia, recovers and is informed of the present situation, including the fact that he is set to appear the following day in court to defend himself at a proceeding intended to prove his insanity. He learns that the people of Rosewater now hate him and many of them falsely claim that Eliot fathered their children and are asking for money. Eliot devises a way out of his predicament: he writes Fred a $100,000 check, and then orders his lawyer to draw up legal papers acknowledging that he is the father of all of his alleged children in Rosewater, thereby creating a county full of heirs with a greater claim on the fortune than Fred. This will foil Mushari&#x27;s plot and ensure that the Rosewater family fortune will be distributed among the people of the county.

== Etymology and symbolism ==

The name Eliot Rosewater suggests a yoking together of opposites. &quot;Eliot&quot; connects the young altruist to T. S. Eliot and his depiction of modern life as a spiritual wasteland devoid of love but surfeited with lust. &quot;Rosewater&quot; can be seen as a combination of the names of the liberal Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the conservative Barry Goldwater. &quot;It becomes apparent that Vonnegut was very much aware of the 1964 US presidential election while writing this novel.&quot;

&quot;A Sum of Money is the leading character in this tale about people&quot;, and &quot;has a sterilizing effect on everyone it touches in the novel.&quot; Money is clearly a dehumanizing force for Vonnegut, as is the class system that begat families like the Rosewaters and the Rockefellers. &quot;The American dream turned belly up, turned green, bobbed to the scummy surface of cupidity unlimited, filled with gas, went bang in the noonday sun&quot;, Vonnegut remarks.

== Musical adaptation ==
In 1979, the novel was adapted into a stage musical with a book and lyrics by Howard Ashman, music by Alan Menken, and additional lyrics by Dennis Green. The musical opened at Off-Broadway&#x27;s Entermedia Theatre on October 14, 1979, and ran for 49 performances.

In July 2016, the New York City Centers Encores! Off-Center concert did a revival of the show. The cast album of this revival was released on July 28, 2017, by Ghostlight Records.

<text>The Free Software Song is a filk song by Richard M. Stallman about free software. The song is set to the melody of the Bulgarian &quot;Sadi Moma&quot;.

A version of this song is also performed by a band (the GNU/Stallmans) during the credits of the documentary &quot;Revolution OS&quot;. In 1998, Matt Loper recorded a techno version of the song. Jono Bacon also recorded a heavy metal version of the song, and the band Fenster recorded a rhythmic version. In addition, there is a Spanish pop punk version recorded by ALEC, and a Rick Astley mashup, &quot;Never Gonna Give GNU Up&quot;.

A version is used in the free software karaoke video game Sinatra.

<text>The &quot;National Anthem of Peru&quot;, also known as the &quot;National March of Peru&quot; and &quot;We Are Free&quot;, was adopted in 1821. The music was composed by José Bernardo Alcedo, and the lyrics were written by José de la Torre Ugarte.

==History==
===Public contest of 1821===


After Peru declared its independence, the general José de San Martín began a public contest to select the &quot;National March&quot;, which was published on 7 August 1821 in the ministerial gazette. The contest called upon professors of poetry, composers and general aficionados, to send their signed productions to the Ministry of the State before 18 September, the day in which a designated commission would decide which of them would be adopted as the &quot;National March&quot;.

Seven compositions were entered, and on a prefixed day, they were reviewed and played in the following order:
*The band musician major from the &quot;Numancia&quot; Battalion
*That of master José Bernardo Alcedo
*That of master Guapaya
*That of master Tena
*That of master 
*That of Father Aguilar, master of the Augustine Chapel
*Another entry of master José Bernardo Alcedo, at the behest of a brother of the Convent of Saint Domingo

After hearing the last production of José Bernardo Alcedo, General José de San Martín stood up and exclaimed, &quot;Without a doubt, this is the National Anthem of Peru.&quot; The following day, a signed decree confirmed this opinion expressed in the midst of great enthusiasm and jubilation. The anthem was first performed publicly in the night of 23 September 1821 in the Theater of Lima, in the presence of San Martín and the supporters of independence, who on that day were once more gathered in the capital. The voice of Rosa Merino, was the first to sing the lyrics to the anthem, from the original verses from the poet José de la Torre Ugarte from Ica. Upon hearing the music and the lyrics of the National Anthem for the first time, the audience responded with a standing ovation directed at Alcedo, who conducted the orchestra.

===Arrangements and modifications===
Diverse publications of the anthem had subtle modifications in the lyrics and the music, which was then restored by Claudio Rebagliati in 1869 at the behest of Alcedo. In 1874 there was a solicitation which asked for a revision to the lyrics of the anthem, in light of the various versions in circulation, as well as the minor mistakes which were found. This initiative was approved, but did not prosper, due to the rejection that it generated in the public opinion at its core and the recognition that it had already become a time honored tradition.

In 1901 there was another intent to reform the anthem, this time approved by the administration of Eduardo López de Romaña, who approved of the music of the restored anthem by Rebagliati. He declared a new contest to select new lyrics as he considered the original lyrics as aggressive towards Spain, which at the time had amiable relations with Peru. The winner of the contest was the poet José Santos Chocano, whose verses along with the same chorus went on to be sung in public schools and in public venues. The lyrics also had references to the great South American liberator hero Simón Bolívar as well as José de San Martín, the nation&#x27;s founder, in the first verse.

It was not long until public opinion once again asked for the original lyrics to be restored. Public pressure was so great that the Peruvian Congress was obligated in 1913 during the administration of President Guillermo Billinghurst to declare untouchable the lyrics as well as the chorus of the National Anthem.

In 1954, at the behest of Raúl Porras Barrenechea, Chabuca Granda composed a new replacement for the first verse in the anthem, but this was never implemented:

The last attempts to change the anthem were first during the administration of General Juan Velasco Alvarado who attempted to change the second and third stanzas. In similar form to previous attempts, it was imposed during official ceremonies and in schools and during the administration of General President Francisco Morales Bermudez the last stanza was sung instead of the first. But these attempts also had no success and the original anthem was once again sung when his successor Fernando Belaunde Terry became President in 1980.

===Officialization of the sung verse===
The Constitutional Tribunal determined in June 2005 that the first stanza in the anthem (&quot;Largo tiempo...&quot;) was not written by José de la Torre Ugarte and that was just a popular folklore, but its insertion into the history of the anthem expressed the will of the people represented in Law N° 1801 passed by Congress which declares it an intangible subject. The Constitutional Tribunal also verified that the fifth stanza had been excluded in the original anthem and considering author&#x27;s rights and the integrity of the piece, it was ordered that the fifth stanza be restored into the official anthem as the sixth stanza with a total of seven stanzas making up the official national anthem.

Starting September 2009, Verse 7 of the National Anthem, as sanctioned by the Peruvian Government, has become the official sung verse of the anthem instead of and replacing the first, with the verse starting to be included in schools from 2010 onward. The Peruvian Armed Forces and National Police of Peru also adopted the new official verse, with a new music video of the anthem made for this purpose at the same month as the adoption of the now official seventh verse of the national anthem.

The &quot;stand at attention&quot; posture is done when it is played for civilians while military, police and fire personnel must render hand salutes when out of formation. Some people do the &quot;hand on heart&quot; posture, following US practice. In ceremonies and concerts, the following shout is done when the anthem&#x27;s performance is over:

* Leader: &quot;¡Viva el Perú!/Kawsachun Piruw!/Ayaya Piruw!/Kimoshiretantsi Peru!&quot; (&quot;Long live Peru!&quot;)
* All: &quot;¡Viva!/Kawsachun!/Ayaya!/Kimoshiretantsi!&quot; (&quot;Long live!&quot;)

The chant &quot;Long Live Peru!&quot; is also done in sporting events, concerts, anniversaries and other occasions after the playing of the national anthem.

<text>The Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, previously the Humanitarian Bowl (1997–2003, 2007–2010) and the MPC Computers Bowl (2004–2006), is an NCAA-sanctioned post-season college football bowl game that has been played annually since 1997 at Albertsons Stadium on the campus of Boise State University in Boise, Idaho. The game is televised nationally on the ESPN family of networks. Cincinnati defeated Utah State in the inaugural game in 1997.

==History==
===Conference tie-ins===
The Humanitarian Bowl was launched, in part, as a response to changes made to the Las Vegas Bowl’s selection process. When the bowl was launched in 1992 as the successor to the California Bowl, it inherited the bowl’s contracted matchup of the champions of the Big West Conference and the Mid-American Conference (MAC) that had been taking place since 1982. However, after the 1996 edition, the Las Vegas Bowl dropped its affiliations with the Big West and the MAC in favor of offering a bid to a team from the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), forcing the conferences to find other solutions. This resulted in two new bowl games being launched for the 1997 season, one of which was awarded to Boise and initially named the Humanitarian Bowl. The Big West, which had Boise State as a member at the time, agreed to terms to send its champion to the bowl. The MAC, meanwhile, sent its champion to the Motor City Bowl in Detroit.
From 1997 to 1999, the Big West champion was matched with a team from Conference USA (C-USA), while in 2000 the WAC sent a representative. The Big West stopped sponsoring football after the 2000 season, and bowl organizers extended a permanent invite to the WAC to replace the Big West as host of the game, and struck an agreement with the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) to provide a bowl-eligible team if it had yet to fill its bowl allotment. The WAC champion received the automatic bid to the game unless that team received a better offer from another bowl game or qualified for the Bowl Championship Series (BCS).

The WAC and ACC met in the 2001 through 2008 editions of the bowl, except for 2002 when the ACC&#x27;s slot was filled by Iowa State of the Big 12 Conference. In 2009, the Mountain West Conference was to provide a team, but Mountain West champion TCU was selected for the Fiesta Bowl and the conference did not have enough bowl-eligible teams to send a replacement; as a result, Bowling Green of the MAC was invited. In 2010, the bowl inherited the MAC&#x27;s International Bowl tie-in after that Toronto-based bowl folded; the bowl featured a MAC vs. WAC matchup through 2012.

After the WAC stopped sponsoring football in 2012, Mountain West inherited its spot as host, reaching agreement with the bowl to provide a team, starting with the December 2013 edition. The bowl featured MAC vs. Mountain West matchups in the 2013 through 2015 games. In 2016, the bowl invited in-state Idaho of the Sun Belt Conference in place of a MAC team. The 2017 edition returned to MAC vs. Mountain West, while in the 2018 edition, independent BYU was invited in place of a Mountain West team. In late July 2019, it was announced that the Mountain West and MAC would maintain their tie-ins to the bowl through the 2025–26 football season. The December 2020 edition included the first invitation to a team from the American Athletic Conference (AAC or &quot;The American&quot;).

===Sponsors===
The game originally named for the Idaho-based World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame. It was sponsored by Micron Technology, an Idaho-based manufacturer, from 1999 to 2002 under the name Crucial.com, which sold computer memory upgrades from Micron. The bowl game then briefly had no sponsor for the January 2004 game. In December 2004, the name was changed to the MPC Computers Bowl. MPC Computers, which is also based in Idaho, was formerly MicronPC, the computer manufacturing division of Micron, but was later split off as a separate company. In April 2007, it was announced that the bowl would again be called the Humanitarian Bowl. In May 2007, Boise-based Roady&#x27;s Truck Stops was announced as the new sponsor, thus renaming the game the Roady&#x27;s Humanitarian Bowl. On May 25, 2010, uDrove, a maker of applications for the transportation industry, became the sponsor of the Humanitarian Bowl, signing a four-year agreement to replace Roady&#x27;s. On August 3, 2011, the Idaho Potato Commission (IPC) signed a six-year naming rights deal to sponsor the bowl, renaming it the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl. In December 2017, IPC announced that they would be sponsoring the bowl for an additional five years.

The game is the longest running cold weather bowl game currently in operation. The payout is $750,000, but teams are required to provide a corporate sponsor, purchase a minimum number of tickets, and stay at a selected hotel for a minimum stay. Because of this, 7–4 UCLA declined an invitation to the 2001 Humanitarian Bowl.

===Highway Angel===
From 2008 through 2012, bowl organizers, in conjunction with the Truckload Carriers Association, featured a &quot;Highway Angel of the Year&quot; to game attendees. Highway Angels are truck drivers who performed a heroic feat to save the life of another motorist.

<text>The Lion King 1½ (known internationally as The Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata) is a 2004 American animated direct-to-video musical comedy film directed by Bradley Raymond, produced by Disneytoon Studios and released on February 10, 2004. The third installment in the &quot;Lion King&quot; franchise, the film is both a prequel and sidequel to &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), focusing on the supporting characters Timon and Pumbaa. A majority of the voice cast from the first film returns to reprise their roles, including Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as the voices of Timon and Pumbaa, respectively. The film&#x27;s structure is inspired by Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, a tragicomedy that tells the story of &quot;Hamlet&quot; from the point of view of two minor characters. &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
While watching their previous adventures in a home movie theater, Timon and Pumbaa decide to tell their own story about how they met, which began some time before meeting Simba.

Timon lives in meerkat colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands with his Ma and Uncle Max. One day, his daydreaming leads to a hyena attack, and an ostracized Timon leaves the colony. The mandrill Rafiki teaches him the philosophy of &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot; and advises him to &quot;look beyond what you see.&quot; Timon takes this advice literally, and, observing Pride Rock in the distance, sets out in that direction. Timon encounters Pumbaa, and learning that he has a &quot;special power&quot; that keeps predators away, invites him along on the journey.

The pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of Simba to the animals of the Pride Lands, and as they make their way through the crowd, Pumbaa passes gas, causing the nearby animals to faint and prompting animals further away to bow to Simba. Attempting to find their perfect home, the pair witness the dramatic ending of &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Wait to Be King&quot;, the chase through the Elephant Graveyard, the hyena march scene of &quot;Be Prepared&quot;, and the wildebeest stampede that kills Mufasa.

Escaping the stampede, the pair are sent down a river and over a waterfall. Exhausted, Timon suggests giving up and going home. Pumbaa admits that he doesn&#x27;t have a home, and the pair realize they are each other&#x27;s only friends. They discover that the river has deposited them in a lush green jungle: their dream home. The pair settle there, embracing &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot; as their philosophy. Meanwhile, Timon&#x27;s mother and Uncle Max leave the colony in search of Timon.

Timon and Pumbaa later rescue Simba and raise him under their philosophy. Years later, Simba&#x27;s childhood friend Nala appears and reunites with him. Believing the trio&#x27;s friendship to be in jeopardy, Timon and Pumbaa try sabotaging their burgeoning romance, and believe they have succeeded when they see the two get into an argument about why Simba refuses to return to Pride Rock. The next day, Nala explains that Simba has returned home to challenge Scar and reclaim his rightful place as king. Pumbaa follows him, but Timon, angry that Simba has seemingly discarded their philosophy, refuses to help. Timon soon becomes lonely without his friends&#x27; company, and Rafiki helps him realize that his true Hakuna Matata is with the ones he loves. Timon catches up and reconciles with Pumbaa in the desert.

After helping to distract the hyenas with a hula dance in the Pride Lands, Timon and Pumbaa run into Ma and Uncle Max. Seeing the hyenas advancing on Simba, Timon proposes that they all help Simba by getting rid of the hyenas for good. Ma and Uncle Max construct a series of tunnels beneath the hyenas while Timon and Pumbaa stall for time. Max collapses the tunnels, breaking the ground under the hyenas. Timon breaks the final support beam himself and the hyenas are ejected through the tunnels. Simba accepts his place as the rightful king of the Pride Lands, thanking Timon and Pumbaa for their help. Timon invites Ma, Uncle Max, and the rest of the meerkat colony to live in the jungle with him and Pumbaa to complete his Hakuna Matata; the colony praise him as their hero.

Back in the theater, Pumbaa asks Timon if they can start from the beginning. Timon initially declines, but his family, Simba, Rafiki, and a host of characters from other Disney media flood the theater and persuade him to rewind it. As the film starts again, Pumbaa suddenly becomes nervous about the size of the crowd.

==Voice cast==

Tony Anselmo, Jeff Bennett, Corey Burton, Bill Farmer, Cathy Cahn, Pat Musick, Jim Cummings, Shaun Fleming, Carolyn Gardner, Bob Joles, Chris Sanders, Kevin Schon, and Blayne Weaver are all credited as providing &quot;additional voices&quot;, many of them reprising roles from other Disney media in the final cameo-packed scene. Speaking and non-speaking characters seen in silhouette in this scene include Mickey Mouse, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Belle, Beast, Mrs. Potts, Chip, the Genie, Aladdin, Jasmine, the Magic Carpet, Lady, Tramp, Hyacinth Hippo, Stitch, Goofy, The Mad Hatter, Rabbit, Donald Duck, Tinker Bell, Peter Pan, the Lost Boys, Pocahontas, Quasimodo, Mowgli, Baloo, Hugo, Victor, and Laverne, Terk, Dumbo, Flora, Fauna, Merryweather, and Br’er Bear.

==Production==
In April 2000, it was announced that the Walt Disney Company had selected Jeff Ahlholm, Colin Goldman, and Tom Rogers to write the script for &quot;The Lion King 3&quot;. It was scheduled to arrive in video stores sometime in 2001. Bradley Raymond, who had previously directed &quot;Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame II&quot; (2002), came on board as director. He recalled that it was then-Disney Feature Animation president Thomas Schumacher&#x27;s idea to &quot;retell &quot;Lion King&quot; through the eyes of Timon and Pumbaa&quot;. Additionally, Roger Allers and Irene Mecchi, who directed and co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Lion King&quot; respectively, consulted on the production. According to Raymond, it was Allers who came up with the &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;–inspired framing of the film. Furthermore, the filmmakers drew inspiration from Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead&quot; as the first &quot;Lion King&quot; film had drawn inspiration from &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

In May 2003, &quot;The Lion King &quot; was scheduled for home video release in early spring 2004 with Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, and Matthew Broderick reprising their original roles, and Elton John and Tim Rice returning to compose a new song, &quot;That’s All I Need&quot; which was based on &quot;The Warthog Rhapsody&quot; which was deleted from the original film.

The film was animated by Walt Disney Animation Australia in Sydney, New South Wales and Disneytoon Studios in the United States.

==Release==
Upon its initial home video release, &quot;The Lion King &quot; was accompanied by a marketing campaign tie-in with McDonald&#x27;s with six Happy Meal toys: Simba, Rafiki, Timon, Pumbaa, Mufasa and Ed. (This same promotion was used in international countries for the Special Edition release of the first &quot;Lion King&quot; with two additional toys featuring Zazu and Scar.)

The DVD edition contains music videos, deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes views of how the movie was made, and two featurettes: &quot;Timon -- The Early Years&quot;; a mockumentary tracing Timon&#x27;s childhood through tongue-in-cheek interviews with family and friends; and &quot;Disney&#x27;s Funniest Moments,&quot; highlighting Disney animated characters from the &quot;Seven Dwarfs&quot; to &quot;Brother Bear&quot;. Three games are also featured, including: &quot;Timon and Pumbaa&#x27;s Virtual Safari 1.5&quot;, a &quot;Lion King&quot; trivia game in the format of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, titled &quot;Who Wants to Be King of the Jungle?&quot;, and hosted by Meredith Vieira, then-host of the American syndicated version and a find the face game which shows pictures of several Disney Characters coming to watch Timon and Pumbaa&#x27;s movie. &quot;The Lion King &quot; was released on February 10, 2004. Internationally, it was titled &quot;The Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata&quot;.

On its first day of sales, the film sold 1.5 million DVD copies, and in its first three days of release the film generated about $55 million in sales revenue, 2.5 of which were DVD copies of the film. By March 2004, six million DVD and VHS copies of the film had been sold in North America. More than 30 percent of the title&#x27;s sales were from the Latino market. Later that year, the movie was released as part of a 3-movie box set along with &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot; on December 6. On January 31, 2005, the film, along with its predecessors, went back into moratorium.

The film was first released on Blu-ray as part of an eight-disc box set on October 4, 2011, along with the other two films. The movie later received a separate Blu-ray release as well as a standard DVD release on March 6, 2012, along with &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot;. The Blu-ray and DVD releases, along with &quot;Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot; and the Diamond Edition release of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, were removed from release on April 30, 2013.

The film was re-released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on a Blu-ray combo pack and digital release along with &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot; on August 29, 2017 — the same day as the first film&#x27;s Signature Edition was released.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 76% based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10.

Frank Lovece of &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film stars out of 4 stating that &quot;This retelling of &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994) from the point of view of comic sidekicks Timon (voice of Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) is one of the rare Disney direct-to-video sequels worthy of the original.&quot; He went on to say that &#x27;the only aspect of the film that feels forced is the revisionist positioning of Timon as young Simba&#x27;s step-dad, which has no emotional echo in the first film. The quality of the animation is surprisingly impressive; some static backgrounds are the primary concession to a small-screen budget and the fluid character movements and expressions are vastly superior to those of, say, &quot;The Lion King&#x27;s Timon and Pumbaa&quot; TV cartoon series.&#x27;&quot; Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a positive review, writing &quot;toddlers and preschoolers will be equally enchanted and amused by colorful toon shenanigans.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article writer Susan King wrote that &quot;Because Disney&#x27;s made-for-video sequels to their classic animated films have been mediocre at best, expectations for this new sequel to the mouse house&#x27;s 1994 blockbuster were slim. But thanks to a clever story line, snappy dialogue that kids and adults will enjoy, a couple of decent new songs and the return of the original voice actors, &quot;Lion King &quot; is an irreverent gas.&quot;

Many reviewers have suggested that the film was influenced by the Tom Stoppard play &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, which follows Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two minor characters from Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and details their experiences taking place during the same time as the events of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, similar to what the film does with its predecessor, which has been similarly compared to &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Screenwriter Tom Rogers confirmed that this was intentional in a 2019 interview, adding that the film&#x27;s frame story was inspired by &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

== Soundtrack ==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack album contains two original songs: &quot;Diggah Tunnah&quot;, written by Seth Friedman and Martin Erskine, and &quot;That&#x27;s All I Need&quot;, written by Elton John and Tim Rice, who had worked on the first film. The latter song, which is performed by Nathan Lane in the film, is largely based on a deleted song from &quot;The Lion King&quot; titled &quot;The Warthog Rhapsody&quot;, with which it shares a similar melody.

The film features the song &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot; from the first film, which is featured both as the original soundtrack recording in the soundtrack album and in the film as a new cover performed by Lane and Ernie Sabella. The soundtrack also consists of various covers of pop songs, such as The Friends of Distinction&#x27;s &quot;Grazing in the Grass&quot; performed by Raven-Symoné, Kool and the Gang&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot; performed by Drew K. and the French, &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; performed by Louis Armstrong, and &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; (which appears briefly in the original film as well) by Lebo M Vinx (and with sampled vocals from Lebo M) performed &quot;Diggah Tunnah Dance&quot;. Other featured songs not on the soundtrack include &quot;Sunrise, Sunset&quot; from the musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and the eponymous theme song from the television show &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; composed by Henry Mancini.

The film contains an original score composed by Don L. Harper, and also features Ennio Morricone&#x27;s instrumental theme from the Sergio Leone film &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;.

<text>Ilkeston ( ) is a town located in the Borough of Erewash in Derbyshire, England, with a population of 40,953 at the 2021 census. Its major industries, coal mining, iron working and lace making/textiles, have now all but disappeared. Part of the Nottingham Urban Area, the town is located between the cities Derby and Nottingham, near the M1 motorway, and on the River Erewash. Its eastern boundary borders Nottinghamshire to the east and is only two miles from Nottingham&#x27;s western edge.

== History and culture ==
Ilkeston was likely founded during the 6th century, and gets its name from its supposed founder Elch or Elcha, who was an Anglian chieftain. The town appears as Tilchestune in the Domesday Book of 1086, when it was owned principally by Gilbert de Ghent. Gilbert also controlled nearby Shipley, West Hallam and Stanton by Dale. Ilkeston was created a borough by Queen Victoria in 1887.

Ilkeston is one of several places where the distinctive dialect of East Midlands English is extensively spoken. Ilkeston is referred to as &#x27;Ilson&#x27; in this dialect. Generally the name is pronounced with three syllables, &quot;Ilkisstun&quot;, not &quot;Ilk&#x27;s tun&quot;.

The American Adventure, a large theme park which closed in 2007, was located on the outskirts of Ilkeston on the former Woodside Colliery adjoining Shipley Country Park.

NatWest&#x27;s Ilkeston branch gained much media interest when a hole in a neighbouring wall received an influx of reviews on Tripadvisor, causing them to suspend reviews in February 2020.

===Stanton Ironworks===
One of the biggest and most important local employers was the Stanton Ironworks, later known as Stanton and Staveley – the continuation of a long-standing tradition of iron working in this area. There has been evidence of iron working and quarrying in the area since Roman times, and the industry began blossoming into a huge industrial concern in the 1780s. By the mid-19th century there were several blast furnaces and the production rose from around 500 tons of pig iron per month to 7,000 at the end of the century. The Stanton Ironworks acquired a number of smaller ironstone quarrying and ironworks companies. These included the Wellingborough Iron Company in 1932.

Steel pipe manufacturing began at Stanton after World War I and later concrete pipes were produced, Stanton being the first in the UK to develop the &#x27;spun pipe&#x27; process.

In the mid-19th century the works produced 20,000 tons of iron castings per year, 2.5 millions by 1905. Up to 12,500 people were employed during the period when the works were part of British Steel Corporation, of which 7,000 worked at the Stanton works.

During its long existence the works produced huge quantities of a variety of products, including pig iron, tunnel castings, (used in projects such as the London Underground), pipes and street furniture as well as bitumen, roadstone, chemicals and munition casings.

The works gradually declined, the business being run from 1985 by the French Saint-Gobain Group. The last casting was an emotional event in 2007. The huge Stanton site has been partially given over to business park and the rest of the site is earmarked for redevelopment which is subject to local opposition.

===Charter fair===
Ilkeston Market Place is the site of a Charter fair. The fair celebrated its 772nd anniversary in 2024, the Charter being granted by King Henry III in 1252. This makes the fair older than Nottingham&#x27;s famous Goose Fair and it is one of the largest street fairs in the Country, indeed in Europe.

The present fair developed from two separate fairs, as another &#x27;agricultural hiring fair&#x27; or &#x27;Statutes Fair&#x27; was traditionally held on Wakes week in October as well as the original Charter Fair which was held on the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (15 August). The two fairs were combined in 1888 and the one Charter Fair has been held in October ever since.

Since 1931 the fair has been officially opened by the Mayor - first of Ilkeston and since 1974 of Erewash - on the Fair Thursday at noon with the Town Clerk (Chief Executive) reading the Charter from the steps of the Town Hall.

===Spa baths===

From early in the 19th century the existence of natural mineral waters was noted here and exploited. A local businessman Thomas Potter built, in 1831, the famous Ilkeston Bath at the bottom of Town Street attached to the Rutland Hotel. For over 60 years the baths helped tourism to the town at a time when spa towns like Bath and Harrogate enjoyed popularity. &#x27;If you&#x27;re doubled in pain and thin as a lath, Come at once then and try, the famed Ilkeston Bath,&#x27; was a well known advertising slogan. A mixture of a general decline in the popularity of spa bathing and, reportedly, contamination of the waters from mining activities led to the eventual closure of the baths just before 1900. The baths and the adjacent Rutland Hotel, which also enjoyed a revenue from tourism, no longer exist though they are remembered in the name of &#x27;Bath Street&#x27;.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Ilkeston did not have a railway station from 1967 to 2017, despite its substantial population and the fact that the Erewash Valley Line (formerly part of the Midland Railway, later the LMS) skirts the eastern edge of the town. Ilkeston once had three railway stations. Ilkeston Junction station, also known as &quot;Ilkeston Junction &amp; Cossall&quot; was on the former Midland Railway and later LMS Erewash Valley Main Line: this station closed in January 1967. A short branch led from this station to Ilkeston Town station, at the north end of Bath Street, which closed to passengers in June 1947.

Ilkeston&#x27;s third station was Ilkeston North, on the former Great Northern Railway (later LNER) line from Nottingham to Derby Friargate station, closed in September 1964. A major feature of this line was Bennerley Viaduct, a long, high, wrought iron structure which still crosses the Erewash valley just to the north east of Ilkeston. Once threatened with demolition, it is now a Grade 2 listed building, though the line and embankments have long since been removed. The Viaduct has been the subject of much renewed interest and has been reopened to the public as part of a cycleway and footpath.

Following a long-running local campaign, in March 2013 Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced that Ilkeston was one of three sites &#x27;most likely&#x27; to get a new station as part of the &#x27;New Stations Fund&#x27;, costing £5 million and sited close to the old Ilkeston Junction station. On 15 May 2013 it was announced this new station would be built, which would be named Ilkeston station. It has two platforms, which can take six trains per hour with up to six passenger cars and includes waiting shelters. A 150 space car park, cycle storage, bus stop, drop off point and taxi rank are also on site. The station is unmanned with automated ticket machines.

Due to flood prevention work and the discovery of great crested newts, the opening was significantly delayed, the new station opened on 2 April 2017.

===Buses===
Trentbarton operates the majority of buses around Ilkeston, including the Ilkeston Flyer into Derby, My15 into Long Eaton and East Midlands Airport, The Two into Nottingham, 31 into Kirk Hallam, 32 into Derby, 33 into Mansfield, and 34 into Hucknall. In addition, Notts + Derby and Littles Travel operate some Derbyshire County Council tendered routes around Ilkeston, the latter operating the 14A and 14B routes into Stanton by Dale and Sandiacre.

<text>Carl Heinrich Graun (7 May 1704 – 8 August 1759) was a German composer and tenor. Along with Johann Adolph Hasse, he is considered to be the most important German composer of Italian opera of his time.

==Biography==
Graun was born in Wahrenbrück in the Electorate of Saxony. In 1714, he followed his brother, Johann Gottlieb Graun, to the school of the Kreuzkirche, Dresden, and sang in the Dresdner Kreuzchor and the chorus of the Opernhaus am Zwinger. He studied singing with Christian Petzold and composition with (1664–1728). In 1724, Graun moved to Braunschweig, singing at the opera house and writing six operas for the company. In 1735, Graun moved to Rheinsberg in Brandenburg, after he had written the opera &quot;Lo specchio della fedeltà&quot; for the marriage of the then crown prince Frederick (the Great) and Elisabeth Christine in Schloss Salzdahlum in 1733. He was &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; to Frederick the Great from his ascension to the throne in 1740 until Graun&#x27;s death nineteen years later in Berlin.

Graun wrote a number of operas. His opera &quot;Cesare e Cleopatra&quot; inaugurated the opening of the Berlin State Opera (Königliche Hofoper) in 1742. &quot;Montezuma&quot; (1755) was written to a libretto by King Frederick. His works are rarely played today, though his passion cantata &quot;Der Tod Jesu&quot; (&quot;The Death of Jesus&quot;, 1755) was frequently performed in Germany for many years after his death. His other works include concertos and trio sonatas. He was known for particularly good text-setting, probably due to his background as a vocalist.

He married twice and had a daughter, who became a singer, from his first marriage and four sons from his second. His great-great-great-great-grandson, Vladimir Nabokov, became an eminent 20th-century novelist.

<doc id="385715" wikidata="Q3218249" url="?curid=385715" title="Las Vegas Bowl">
<text>The Las Vegas Bowl is an NCAA Division I FBS annual post-season college football bowl game held in the Las Vegas area. First played in 1992, the bowl was originally held at the 40,000-seat Sam Boyd Stadium in Whitney, Nevada, before moving to the 65,000-seat Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, in 2021. The bowl is owned and operated by ESPN Events.

==Conference tie-ins==
As the Las Vegas Bowl was effectively the replacement for the California Bowl, it inherited that bowl&#x27;s tie-ins with the champions of the Big West Conference and the Mid-American Conference. These remained intact until 1996, after which the Big West&#x27;s champion earned a berth in the Humanitarian Bowl while the MAC&#x27;s champion was given a berth in the Motor City Bowl. 1997 through 1999 saw a team from the Western Athletic Conference face an at-large team, and the Mountain West Conference took over for the WAC for the 1999 and 2000 games (the 1999 game featured both WAC and Mountain West teams). Beginning in 2001, the Mountain West and Pac-12 Conferences (originally known as the Pacific-10 Conference) matched up in Las Vegas.

From 2001 until 2005, the second-place team in the Mountain West was chosen to face the Pac-12. Beginning in 2006, after its contract with the Liberty Bowl expired, the Mountain West agreed to send its champion to the Las Vegas Bowl to face the Pac-12&#x27;s 5th or 6th-place team. From 2006 until 2013, the Mountain West would send a secondary team if the champion qualified for the Bowl Championship Series or, as per the rules of the Hawaiʻi Bowl, was Hawaiʻi. The 2016 game would have pitted the Pac-12&#x27;s #6 team against the winner of the Mountain West Conference Football Championship Game, provided that the winner of the game does not automatically qualify for one of the College Football Playoff&#x27;s six bowls as the highest-ranking member of the &quot;Group of Five&quot; (champions of the Mountain West, Sun Belt, American, or Mid-American Conferences, as well as the Conference USA champion comprise this group). However, since the Pac-12 only had six bowl-eligible teams and two of them qualified for New Years Six bowls, the bowl elected to invite the Houston Cougars of the American Athletic Conference instead of a Pac-12 team.

To heighten the profile of the game with its move to Allegiant Stadium, the Las Vegas Bowl announced a new, five-year, alternating tie-in between the SEC and Big Ten beginning 2020. An SEC team will play the Las Vegas Bowl in even-numbered years, while a Big Ten team will play in odd-numbered years. The conference not playing in the Las Vegas Bowl will play in the Duke&#x27;s Mayo Bowl (formerly Belk Bowl). The Mountain West moved its top selection from the Las Vegas Bowl to the newly-established LA Bowl.

Even though 10 of the current Pac-12 teams are departing this season for other conferences, the Pac-12 or Pac-12 &quot;legacy teams&quot; (the 10 schools leaving for the Big Ten, Big 12, and ACC) are still contractually obligated to fulfill their previous Pac-12 bowl tie-ins through the 2025 season. 

==History==
The game originated from the California Raisin Bowl, which was played in Fresno from 1981 to 1991. In 1992, Fresno State, formerly of the Big West, moved to the Western Athletic Conference. The Big West and MAC then pulled out of Fresno and sought a new home for their conference champions. They found it in Las Vegas, where organizers were looking for a way to boost hotel revenue. In those days, the Christmas season was a slow period for Las Vegas hotels and casinos. The first Las Vegas Bowl was played in 1992.

The NCAA adopted an overtime rule for the 1995 post-season and all games thereafter. In 1995, Toledo defeated Nevada, 40–37, in the first ever overtime game in Division I-A college football. The following season, the policy of overtime was adopted for regular season games to break ties.

In 2001, ESPN Regional Television purchased the Las Vegas Bowl from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

On December 25, 2002, UCLA interim coach Ed Kezirian was victorious in his only game as the UCLA head coach as UCLA won 27–13 over New Mexico. In that game, New Mexico sent Katie Hnida in to kick an extra point which was the first time a woman played in a Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (née Division I-A) college football game. The kick was blocked.

The 2007 Las Vegas Bowl featured a rematch between Mountain West Champion BYU and UCLA who defeated BYU during the regular season. UCLA scored first on a field goal after a fumble by BYU quarterback Max Hall. BYU answered with a touchdown reception by Austin Collie. BYU went up 17–6 with Michael Reed catch for a touchdown. A fumble by BYU with 19 seconds left in the first half allowed UCLA to score and cut the lead to 17–13. UCLA cut the deficit to 17–16 on a 50-yard field goal. With two minutes left UCLA took over at their own two-yard line. They were able to drive down to the BYU 13-yard line with 3 seconds left. The 28-yard field goal attempt was partially blocked by BYU defensive tackle Eathyn Manumaleuna and fell short giving BYU their second Vegas Bowl victory in three tries, also making the Cougars the first school to win back-to-back Las Vegas Bowls. The following year, though, the Arizona Wildcats denied BYU their third consecutive Las Vegas Bowl win by winning 31–21.

On September 25, 2013, Royal Purple was announced as the new title sponsor for the next three years. Following the expiration of Royal Purple&#x27;s sponsorship of the title from 2013 to 2015, the game became officially known as the Las Vegas Bowl.

With the relocation of the Oakland Raiders to the Las Vegas area, Allegiant Stadium was constructed to replace Sam Boyd Stadium. The Las Vegas Bowl along with the other events held at Sam Boyd Stadium moved to the new stadium upon completion.

On December 2, 2020, the 2020 edition of the game was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its tie-ins (SEC and Pac-12) were transferred to the ESPN Events-owned Armed Forces Bowl in Fort Worth, Texas.

==Sponsors==
The bowl was known as the SEGA Sports Las Vegas Bowl from 2001 to 2002. From 2003 to 2008, the title sponsor was the Pioneer Corporation. From 2009 to 2012, the game was known as the Maaco Bowl Las Vegas, as the sponsor was MAACO. From 2013 to 2015, the game was known as the Royal Purple Las Vegas Bowl as the sponsor was Royal Purple. For the 2016 edition, the game was known as the Las Vegas Bowl presented by GEICO as GEICO was the presenting sponsor. On July 12, 2018, it was announced that Mitsubishi would be the new title sponsor, with the game renamed as the Mitsubishi Motors Las Vegas Bowl as part of a two-year deal. On April 20, 2021, SRS Distribution signed a five-year agreement with ESPN to become the title sponsor, making the game the SRS Distribution Las Vegas Bowl.

<text>Utility cycling encompasses any cycling done simply as a means of transport rather than as a sport or leisure activity. It is the original and most common type of cycling in the world. Cycling mobility is one of the various types of private transport and a major part of individual mobility.

== Overview ==

Utility or &quot;transportational&quot; cycling generally involves traveling short and medium distances (several kilometres, not uncommonly 3–15 kilometres one way, or somewhat longer), often in an urban environment. It includes commuting (i.e. going to work, school or university), going shopping and running errands, as well as heading out to see friends and family or for other social activities.

It also includes economic activity such as the delivering of goods or services. In cities, the bicycle courier is often a familiar feature, and cargo bikes are capable of competing with trucks and vans particularly where many small deliveries are required, especially in congested areas. Velotaxis can also provide a public transport service like buses and taxicabs.

Utility cycling is known to have several social and economic benefits. Policies that encourage utility cycling have been proposed and implemented for reasons including: improved public health, individual health and employers&#x27; profits a reduction in traffic congestion and air pollution, improvements in road traffic safety, improved quality of life, improved mobility and social inclusiveness, and benefits to child development.

In the Chinese city of Beijing alone, there are an estimated four million bicycles in use (it has been estimated that in the early-1980s there were approximately 500 million cyclists in China). As of 2000, there were an estimated 80 million bicycles in Japan, accounting for 17% of commuter trips, and in the Netherlands, 27% of all trips are made by bicycle.

Cycling has been considered 

Cycling mobility can be contrasted with mass automobility for which it is an immediate competitor in cities and for shorter distances.

Cities are a hotbed for experimenting with new bicycle-based forms of mobility like bicycle sharing, electric bicycles and transport of bulky goods with cargo bikes. 
After decades of relative stagnation in bicycle development, new technologies and materials are tried to further improve upon the environmental footprint of the bicycle. Even though it is recognized that cycling - the one foremost active mobility besides walking - is the most sustainable kind of mobility and means of transportation, in some countries, cycling is still the mode of transport for the poor; in others, cycling is seen fit only for leisure purposes.
In a 2010 document requested by the European Parliament Committee on Transport and Tourism that mobility not only entails the ability to travel, but also encompasses, more importantly, the possibility for the traveller to decide when and where to travel. In terms of this flexibility and cost, bicycles rank among the top choices for shorter distances, up to several kilometers.

== History ==

The development of the safety bicycle was arguably the most important change in the history of the bicycle. It shifted their use and public perception from being a dangerous toy for sporting young men to being an everyday transport tool for men—and, crucially, women—of all ages.
By the start of the 20th century, cycling had become an important means of transportation, and in the United States an increasingly popular form of recreation. Bicycling clubs for men and women spread across the U.S. and across European countries.
Cycling steadily became more important in Europe over the first half of the twentieth century, but it dropped off dramatically in the United States between 1900 and 1910. Automobiles became the preferred means of transportation. Over the 1920s, bicycles gradually became considered children&#x27;s toys, and by 1940 most bicycles in the United States were made for children.
For most of the twentieth century, the great majority of cycling in the UK took place on roads. Cycling is one of the modes of transport for student transport.

== The bicycle and the cyclist&#x27;s equipment ==

Utility bicycles have many standard features to enhance their usefulness and comfort. Chain guards and mudguards, or fenders, protect clothes and moving parts from oil and spray. Skirt guards prevent long coats, skirts, and other trailing clothes and items catching in the wheel. Kickstands help with parking. Front-mounted wicker or steel baskets for carrying goods are often used. Rear luggage carriers can be used to carry items such as school satchels.

Panniers or special luggage carriers (including waterproof packing bags) enable the transport of goods and are used for shopping. Parents sometimes add rear-mounted child seats and/or an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar to transport children. Trailers of various types and load capacities may be towed to greatly increase cargo capacity. In many jurisdictions bicycles must be fitted with a bell; reflectors; and, after dark, front and rear lights.

The use by cyclists of vests or armbands fluorescent in daylight or reflective at night can increase a cyclist&#x27;s conspicuity, although these are not an alternative to a legally compliant lighting system. A report on the promotion of walking and cycling (Hydén, et al., 1999) discussed safety clothing and equipment and stated that &quot;there is no doubt that both pedestrian reflectors and bicycle helmets are reducing the injury risk of their users quite considerably&quot;, although this assertion is not universally accepted. 
== Factors that influence levels of utility cycling ==
Many different factors combine to influence levels of utility cycling. In developing economies, a large amount of utility cycling may be seen simply because the bicycle is the most affordable form of vehicular transport available to many people. In richer countries, where people can have the choice of a mixture of transport types, a complex interplay of other factors influences the level of bicycle use.

Factors affecting cycling levels may include: town planning (including quality of infrastructure: cyclist &quot;friendly&quot; vs. cyclist &quot;hostile&quot;), trip-end facilities (particularly secure parking), retail policy, marketing the public image of cycling, integration with other transport modes, cycle training, terrain (hilly vs. flat), distance to destinations, levels of motorized transport and climate as well as cost. In developed countries cycling has to compete with, and work with, alternative transport modes such as private cars, public transport and walking. Thus cycling levels are not influenced just by the attractiveness of cycling alone, but also by what makes the competing modes more or less attractive.

In developed countries with high utility cycling levels, utility cyclists tend to undertake relatively short journeys. According to Irish 1996 Census data, over 55% of cycling workers travelled 3 miles (4.8 km) or less, 27% 5 miles (8 km) or less and only 17% travelled more than 5 miles in their daily commute. It can be argued that factors that directly influence trip length or journey time are among the most important in making cycling a competitive transport mode. Car ownership rates can also be influential. In New York City, more than half of all households do not own a car (the figure is even higher in Manhattan, over 75%), and walk/bicycle modes of travel account for 21% of all modes for trips in the city.
E-bike use was shown to increase the distance cycled for commuting as well as the amount of physical activity among E-bike users in seven European cities.

Decisions taken by various levels of government, as well as local groups, residents&#x27; organizations and public- and private-sector employers, can all affect the so-called &quot;modal choice&quot; or &quot;modal split&quot; in daily transport. In some cases, various factors may be manipulated in a manner that deliberately seeks to encourage or discourage various transport modes, including cycling.
The League of American Bicyclists has designated a set of five criteria for evaluating the friendliness of a town or city to bicycles. These criteria are classified under the headings of: Engineering, Encouragement, Evaluation and Planning, Education, Enforcement.

=== Town planning ===

Trip length and journey times are key factors affecting cycle use. Town planning may have a key effect in deciding whether key destinations, schools, shops, colleges, health clinics, public transport interchanges remain within a reasonable cycling distance of the areas where people live. The urban form can influence these issues, compact and circular settlement patterns tending to promote cycling. Alternatively, the low-density, non-circular (i.e., linear) settlement patterns characteristic of urban sprawl tends to discourage cycling. In 1990, the Dutch adopted the &quot;ABC&quot; guidelines, specifically limiting developments that are major attractants to locations that are readily accessible by non-car users.
Settlements that provide a dense road network consisting of interconnected streets will tend to be viable utility cycling environments. In contrast, other communities may use a cul-de-sac based, housing estate/housing subdivision model where minor roads are disconnected and only feed into a street hierarchy of progressively more &quot;arterial&quot; type roads. Such communities may discourage cycling by imposing unnecessary detours and forcing all cyclists onto arterial roads, which may be perceived as busy and dangerous, for all trips regardless of destination or purpose.

There is evidence that people who live in such estates are heavier than people who live in places where walking and cycling are more convenient. It is also reported that the extra motor-traffic such communities generate tends to increase overall per-capita traffic casualty rates. Designs that propose to resolve the contradiction between the cul-de-sac and the traditional interconnected network, such as the Fused Grid, have been proposed and built with varying levels of success. Particular issues have arisen with personal security and public order problems in some housing schemes using &quot;back alley&quot; or &quot;back garden&quot; type links. The UK &quot;Manual for Roads&quot; (2007) states: &quot;The basic tenet is &#x27;public fronts and private backs&#x27;. Ideally, and certainly, in terms of crime prevention, back gardens should adjoin other back gardens or a secure communal space. ... If streets are bounded by back-garden fences or hedges, security problems can increase, drivers may be encouraged to speed, land is inefficiently used, and there is a lack of a sense of place.&quot;

== Cycling infrastructure ==
Cycling infrastructure attempts to maximise cyclists safety against the other road users. The risk of collision with other road users remains high due to speed differences and poor visibility. Infrastructure such as segregated cycle lanes, advance stop lines, cycle routes and networks, roundabout design, speed management, and the use of colour all provide varying degrees of separation and protection from other road users. There is, however, a lack of published evidence identifying a change in rates of collisions after implementation of cycling infrastructure. 

Cycling is a common mode of transport in the Netherlands, with 36% of the people listing the bicycle as their most frequent mode of transport on a typical day as opposed to the car by 45% and public transport by 11%. Cycling has a modal share of 27% of all trips (urban and rural) nationwide.

This high modal share for bicycle travel is enabled by unusually flat topography, excellent cycling infrastructure such as cycle paths, cycle tracks, protected intersections, ample bicycle parking and by making cycling routes shorter, quicker and more direct than car routes.

In the countryside, a growing number of inter-city bicycle paths connect the Netherlands&#x27; villages, towns and cities: some of these paths are part of the Dutch National Cycle Network, a network of routes for bicycle tourism which reaches all corners of the nation.

In cities modal share for bicycles is even higher, such as Amsterdam which has 38%.

Cycling infrastructure attempts to maximise cyclists safety against the other road users. There is, however, a lack of published evidence identifying a change in rates of collisions after implementation of cycling infrastructure. 

== Marketing: the public image of cycling ==
As with other activities, cycling can be promoted by marketing. Promotors may include official agencies and authorities.

=== Positive marketing of cycling ===
Two themes predominate in cycling promotion 1) the benefits for the cyclist and 2) the benefits for society and the environment that may occur if more people choose to cycle. The benefits for the cyclist tend to focus issues like reduced journey times in congested urban conditions and the health benefits which the cyclist obtains through regular exercise. Societal benefits focus on general environmental and public health issues. Promotional messages and tactics may include:
* financial savings on transportation
* keeping travel times predictable; in peak traffic, cycling can be the fastest way of moving around town
* ensuring best use of the space available (during trips and also while parked), therefore reducing congestion on the roads
* reminding people of the advantages in terms of health and of effectiveness of using the bicycle
* making maps of journeys that can be completed by bicycle
* reduction of and harmful emissions by fewer people driving motor vehicles
* reducing demand for oil-based fuels
* the safety in numbers effect if more people cycle
* reduced noise pollution in urban areas
* amusement
* cyclist health
** lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease (when practised for more than a quarter of an hour a day at a moderate pace) and therefore improvement of individual and public health
** using cycling to tackle the obesity crisis facing rich countries
** the financial savings for society if general health improves

Further following positive aspects are:
*transport efficiency - cycling is the fastest and most flexible mode for &#x27;door to door&#x27; travel, like in bicycle commuting.
*environmental benefits - most energy efficient means of transport, with the least pollution.
*health and fitness issues - 4 hours of cycling per week or approximately 10 km of cycling per day, equivalent to the average cycle trip to and from work, is an adequate level of exercise.
*economic and social impacts - cycling provides transport to segments of the population who would not otherwise be able to travel independently for reasons of age (student transport), poverty, insufficient public transport infrastructure, etc.

=== Negative marketing of utility cycling ===
Various interests may wish to portray a negative image of utility cycling on public roads for various reasons. Some governments, wishing to promote private car use, have organized and funded publicity designed to discourage road cycling. Official road safety organisations have been accused of distributing literature that emphasizes the danger of cycling on roads while failing to address attitudinal issues among the drivers of motor vehicles who are the main source of road danger. Some road safety authorities have been accused of having a deliberate policy of discouraging cycling as a means of reducing bicyclist casualty statistics. In 2003, Shanghai police officials released statements blaming cyclists as the cause of &quot;gridlock&quot; in the city and promoting plans to ban cyclists from the city streets. Starting in the 1970s, the authorities in the city of Jakarta declared &quot;war&quot; on the &quot;becak&quot; or Indonesian cycle rickshaw blaming them for traffic congestion among other things.

As with other sellers of consumer goods, the car industry&#x27;s marketing efforts frequently try to associate the use of their product with a perception of increased social status. Observers in some car-focused cultures have noted a tendency to perceive or portray people who use bicycles as members of a social &quot;out-group&quot; with attributed negative connotations. In such cultures, such attitudes are displayed in attacks on cyclists in the media. Common themes include blanket descriptions of cyclists as a group who do not pay taxes, who break the law and who have no, or reduced, &quot;right&quot; to use public roads.

Negative aspects are:
*lack of or inadequacy of road and parking infrastructures - roads are built for cars and bicycle paths are often in worse condition than roads. Cycling infrastructure and bicycle-friendliness is generally neglected in favor of a car-centric infrastructure.
*cyclists’ safety and security - the common space for cars and bicycles on the road is not complemented by the same rights and significantly higher risk of accidents for cyclists.
*weather conditions - rain and snow impact the unsheltered cyclist more than car drivers.
*poor intermodality - because of lack of transport facilities for the bicycles themselves (in trains, buses, etc.) for longer distances.

=== Retail policy ===
If significant use of bicycles for shopping trips is to be achieved, sufficient retail services must be maintained within reasonable cycling distances of residential areas. In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany the high levels of utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle. It is arguable that this is related to policies that favour access to retail services by non-motorised modes. The Danish 1997 Planning Act requires that planning shall encourage a diverse mix of retail shops in small and medium-sized towns and in individual districts of large cities and ensure that retail trade uses will be placed in locations to which people have good access by walking, bicycling and public transport. From the mid-1970s the Netherlands has had policies in place to severely restrict the growth of large out-of-town retail developments. Germany has had federal planning regulations in place to restrict retail uses to designated areas since the 1960s. In addition, since the 1970s federal regulations have been in place specifying that developments above a certain size (1,200 m2) be assessed regarding potential adverse effects. These federal regulations are further strengthened by regionally adopted regulations. This includes regulations specifying that new retail centers be limited to selling products not readily provided by shops at inner city/town center locations. In Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany, this approach not restricted to planning guidelines and is also supported by a ban on below-cost selling. This supports smaller shops by preventing large multiples from engaging in predatory pricing practices by aggressively discounting key goods to use as so-called loss leaders.

==== Alternative retail policies ====
From the 1980s to mid-1990s the UK operated a system of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; with regard to retail policy. The &quot;great car economy&quot; philosophy of the Thatcher government directly favored the growth of out-of-town retail centers at the expense of established retail services in British towns and cities. The UK Town and Country Planning Association cites research by the New Economics Foundation that notes a continuing process of change in retail provision.
* General stores are closing at the rate of one per day.
* Between 1997 and 2002, specialized stores, including butchers, bakers, fishmongers, and newsagents, closed at the rate of 50 per week.
* Nearly 30,000 independent food, drink, and tobacco retailers, or over 40%, have been lost over the past decade.

It is arguable that in such a retail/planning policy environment use of bicycles ceases to be a viable option for many shoppers and access to a private motor-car or public transport becomes a necessary prerequisite for access to basic services.

== Cycle training ==
Cycle training is another measure that is advocated as a means of maintaining or increasing levels of cycle use. The training involves teaching existing or potential cyclists bike handling, various roadcraft or &quot;cyclecraft&quot; skills (vehicular cycling) and educating them on the safe, lawful use of the roads. Bicycle training schemes can be differentiated according to whether they are aimed at children or adults.

In the UK, the now superseded &quot;National Cycle Proficiency&quot; scheme was focused on primary schoolchildren aged 8 and above. In this, children would start by gaining an off-road certificate working up to their on-road certificate by the age of ten. Initial training and examination took place on simulated road layouts within school playgrounds. This approach has now been supplemented by the new &quot;National Standard&quot; for cycle training which is more focussed on practical on-road training. This is part of Cycling England&#x27;s portfolio of practical assistance to local authorities and other bodies, aimed at achieving their aim of &quot;More cycling, more safely, more often&quot;.

In the United States, the League of American Bicyclists Smart Cycling 101/201 courses, based on the Effective Cycling program, has modules aimed at all ages from children to adult beginners to more experienced adults. It is argued that such schemes do not just build confidence in the students but also make it more likely that parents will let their children cycle to school. Cycle training may also be offered in an attempt to overcome cultural unfamiliarity with cycling or perceived cultural obstacles to bicycle use. In the Netherlands, some cycle training courses are targeted at women from immigrant communities, as a means of overcoming such obstacles to cycling by women from developing countries.

== User associations ==
As with other walks of life, utility cyclists may form associations in order to promote and develop cycling as an everyday form of transport. The European Cyclists&#x27; Federation is the umbrella body for such groups in Europe. These associations may lobby various institutions to encourage political support or to oppose measures that they judge counter-productive, such as to oppose the introduction of compulsory bicycle helmet legislation.

== Free bicycle/short term hire schemes ==

Local bike-sharing schemes, a business which blossomed at the turn of the 21st century, are more oriented to utility cycling than other bike rentals.

== Influence of technology ==

Modern bicycle technology supports the shift towards utility cycling:
* easy-running thick tires or damped springs allow cycling over curbs
* dynamo, brakes, and gears improved and increased the riding safety, allowing usage also for elderly
* electric support was further developed in motorized bicycle or electric power-assist system and eases the take up for untrained

<text>Charles-Émile Reynaud (8 December 1844 – 9 January 1918) was a French inventor, responsible for the praxinoscope (an animation device patented in 1877 that improved on the zoetrope) and was responsible for the first projected animated films. His &quot;Pantomimes Lumineuses&quot;
premiered on 28 October 1892 in Paris. His Théâtre Optique film system, patented in 1888, is also notable as the first known instance of film perforations being used. The performances predated Auguste and Louis Lumière&#x27;s first paid public screening of the cinematographe on 26 December 1895, often seen as the birth of cinema.
==Early life==
Charles-Émile Reynaud was born in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, on 8 December 1844, to Brutus Reynaud, an engineer who moved to Paris from Le Puy-en-Velay in 1842, and Marie-Caroline Bellanger, a former schoolteacher who educated Émile at home. Marie-Caroline was trained in watercolor painting by Pierre-Joseph Redouté
and taught her son drawing and painting techniques. By 1862 he started his own career as a photographer in Paris.

Reynaud constructed steam engines at age 13. He worked as an apprentice for Antoine Samuel Adam-Salomon. At age 19 he met François-Napoléon-Marie Moigno at one of Moigno&#x27;s lectures and became his assistant. Brutus died in 1865, and the Reynaud family moved to Le Puy-en-Velay. Reynaud was taught Latin, Greek, physics, chemistry, mechanics, and natural sciences by his uncle, a doctor in the area. He was a nurse during the Franco-Prussian War. 

==Career==

Reynaud started holding free magic lantern shows similar to Moigno&#x27;s in December 1873. He created the praxinoscope out of a cookie box after reading a series of 1876 articles in &quot;La Nature&quot; about optical illusion devices. He patented it in 1877, and received a honourable mention at the 1878 Exposition Universelle. He started production on the device and was able to quit his teaching job after its financial success. The device was initially offered at Le Bon Marché stores. Ernest Meissonier displayed Eadweard Muybridge&#x27;s &quot;The Horse in Motion&quot; using a praxinoscope in 1882.

Reynaud&#x27;s son Paul stated that his father&#x27;s inspiration for the Théâtre Optique came after seeing a penny-farthing. The system was displayed at the 1889 Exposition Universelle. He filed a patent on 1 December 1888, and it was issued on 14 January 1889. He received a patent for it in the United Kingdom on 8 February. He signed a contract with the Musée Grévin on 11 October 1892, and its first regular public screenings started on 28 October. The first showing included screenings of &quot;Un bon bock&quot;, &quot;Le Clown et ses chiens&quot;, and &quot;Pauvre Pierrot&quot;. &quot;Un Rêve au coin du feu&quot; was shown from December 1894 to July 1897, and &quot;Autour d&#x27;une cabine&quot; from December 1894 to March 1900.

Reynaud received 500 francs () per month and 10% of the box office. The contract disadvantaged Reynaud as he paid for the maintenance of the system and was required to oversee all of the daily showings. He closed the theatre from 28 February 1894 to 1 January 1895, and instead had a magician perform so that he could improve his equipment. In 1895, Arthur Meyer, the owner of the Musée Grévin, demanded that Reynaud produce more films, which he painted himself. He created the photo-scénographe, a version of the théâtre optique that could take photographs, in 1895, but it was overshadowed by the cinematograph of Auguste and Louis Lumière. Reynaud estimated that the 12,000 showings were attended by a total of 500,000 people.

Reynaud hired George Foottit and Chocolat to perform a William Tell routine at Parc de Saint-Cloud and recorded them using the photo-scénographe in April 1896. He hand-colored the frames and showed the film from August 1896 to March 1900. A film using Félix Galipaux was shown from July 1897 to December 1898. However, the success of other filmmakers reduced the popularity of Reynaud&#x27;s showings and they ended on 1 March 1900. He destroyed the théâtre optique during a fit of despair and years later he threw most of his films into the Siene. However, his son preserved &quot;Autour d&#x27;une cabine&quot; and &quot;Pauvre Pierrot&quot;. Léon Gaumont wanted to purchase the théâtre optique from Reynaud and donate it to a museum, but it was already destroyed.

Reynaud patented the stéréo-cinéma, a stereo camera that could take 3D film, on 16 October 1902. He made several films with the camera, but was unable to find financial backing.

==Personal life==
Reynaud married Marguerite Rémiatte, with whom he had two sons, on 21 October 1879. During World War I he lived in hospitals and nursing homes before dying on 9 January 1918.

==Legacy==
Henri Langlois convinced Reynaud&#x27;s son to donate surviving praxinoscopes and &quot;Autour d&#x27;une cabine&quot; to the Cinémathèque Française in the 1930s. Langlois reconstructed the théâtre optique for the opening of the Musée de la Cinémathèque in 1972. Julien Pappé restored &quot;Pauvre Pierrot&quot; in 1981, and &quot;Autour d&#x27;une cabine&quot; was transferred to 35mm film in 1985.

==Filmography==
The 5 &quot;Pantomimes Lumineuses&quot; were painted directly onto a transparent strip of images of shellac protected gelatin and manipulated by hand to create an approximately 15 minute show comprising approximately 500 images per title. The three &quot;Photo-peintures animées&quot; (animated photo-paintings) were directed with the Photo-Scénographe, a camera inspired by the &quot;Chronophotographe à bande mobile&quot; of Étienne-Jules Marey.

<text>Irthlingborough () is a town on the River Nene in North Northamptonshire, England. As of 2021, it has a population of 9,325, and was at one point the smallest town in England to have had a Football League team, Rushden &amp; Diamonds F.C.. The parish church, St Peter, has a lantern tower, unusual for Northamptonshire churches, which was built to guide travellers across the Nene valley in foggy weather. It also has doors at the four cardinal points and has eight misericords in the chancel.

Irthlingborough railway station, opened in 1845 and closed to passengers in 1964.

==History==
The town&#x27;s name origin is uncertain. &#x27;Ploughmen&#x27;s fortification&#x27;, with the suggestion that oxen were once kept here. Perhaps, &#x27;fortification of Yrtla&#x27;s people&#x27;. Alternatively, the first element may be an Old English &#x27;yrthling&#x27;, a type of bird such as a wren, wagtail or lapwing. Bird names are frequently used to form compounds with Old English &#x27;burh&#x27;.

Irthlingborough was called &quot;Yrtlingaburg&quot; in the 8th century, &quot;Erdiburn&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, and &quot;Artleborough&quot; later. King Offa of Mercia held court near Irthlingborough &quot;circa&quot; 790.

John Pyel, the mayor of London in 1372, is believed to have been born at Irthlingborough &quot;circa&quot; 1310.

===Mining===
In the past, ironstone was mined near Irthlingborough, and as part of the local ironstone mine, a tunnel was bored between Irthlingborough and nearby Finedon. The tunnel still exists, but the Irthlingborough end has been landscaped over, and the Finedon end sealed with concrete.

Iron ore was mined at Irthlingborough from 1918. The mine was owned and operated by Richard Thomas &amp; Baldwin&#x27;s Ltd., the ore being sent to RTB&#x27;s Redbourne steelworks in Scunthorpe. The ore was extracted from a system of underground tunnels approximately 80–100 ft below the surface. The mine was closed down as no longer economic on 30 September 1965.

===Quarrying===
More recently, the River Nene floodplains between the town and its neighbour, Higham Ferrers, have been quarried for gravel. Quarrying in the area was extensive, stretching to Northampton in the west (upstream) and Thorpe Waterville in the north-northeast (downstream). The quarries were later left to fill with water to produce artificial lakes.

In 2012, the area was acquired by The Wildlife Trust, and has since been turned into Irthlingborough Lakes and Meadows, a nature reserve. It will be part of the Upper Nene Valley Special Protection Area.

==Main roads==
The A6 used to pass through the town, but was bypassed in the 1930s to the north. The former route is the B5348. Irthlingborough Viaduct was built in 1936 and connects the town to Higham Ferrers and the busy A45. The A45 (former A605) is a straighter and more dependable road than the A6.

==Local economy==
Whitworths, the home baking and fruit snack company, has been based in the town since 1886, and in 2024 employed 200 people at the plant on the B571 (Wellingborough Road). Sonifex, a manufacturer of radio broadcast products, has been in the town since its beginning in 1969 and has its research and manufacturing based on Station Road. Dr. Martens has a long history with the town; the manufacturer R. Griggs, owned by Max Griggs, had its head office in the town until production moved to China in 2003, after suffering large losses. The company&#x27;s office is now in Wollaston.

==Education==
There is an infant school, with nursery attached, a junior school and one secondary school, Huxlow Academy, which has a sixth form that is part of the east Northamptonshire sixth form college.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Northampton on 103.6 FM, Heart East on 96.6 FM and Smooth East Midlands (formerly Connect FM) on 107.4 FM.The town is served by the local newspaper, Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph.

==Sport==
Between 2001 and 2006 Irthlingborough held the distinction of being the smallest town to hold a Football League club when Rushden &amp; Diamonds F.C. were promoted to League 2 (then known as Division 3) after winning the 2000-01 Football Conference title. This was in part due to the funding of local businessman Max Griggs who bankrolled the club in the late 1990s until the mid millennium when he sold to a fans group for just £1 in 2005. The club were relegated from the Football League in 2006 and went out of business in 2011 due to severe financial problems. A successor fans owned club, AFC Rushden &amp; Diamonds, was formed two months after Rushden and Diamonds folded in July 2011. In its first season it had an under-18 youth team which played at Raunds Town F.C., then joining the United Counties League (Step 6 in the FA Pyramid) in a ground share arrangement with Wellingborough Town at the Dog and Duck stadium. Two further promotions followed with AFCRD reaching Step 4. In 2018, having played for one season at Hayden Road ground in Rushden (the former home of Rushden Town before the forming of RDFC in 1992) in another ground share with Rushden and Higham Utd, the club won promotion to the FA&#x27;s Step 3 Premier Division Central of the Southern Football League. The original stadium, Nene Park, was demolished in 2017.

==Notable people==
Snooker player Shaun Murphy grew up in the town.

<text>Pier Francesco Tosi (c. 16531732) was a castrato singer, composer, and writer on music. His &quot;Opinoni de&#x27; cantori antichi e moderni...&quot; was the first full-length treatise on singing and provides a unique glimpse into the technical and social aspects of Baroque vocal music.

==Life and career==
Tosi was born in Cesena, Italy in 1653 or 1654. There is a disagreement among sources whether he was the son of composer Giuseppe Felice Tosi. He was castrated before puberty to preserve his high voice. While it is not known where he received his rudimentary music training, he sang at a church in Rome from 1676 to 1677 and at the Milan cathedral from 1681 until 1685, when he was dismissed for “misconduct.” Thereafter, he made his one recorded appearance in opera at Reggio nell’Emilia in 1687 (in Varischino’s &quot;Odoacre&quot;) and was based for a time in Genoa. In 1693 Tosi relocated to London where he took on singing students and sang in weekly public concerts. In 1701 he entered into the service of Austrian Emperor Joseph I and Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, whom he served as a musical and diplomatic agent, traveling extensively until 1723. In 1724 he returned to a London ablaze with the works of Handel, where he again taught and was a founding member of the Academy of Ancient Music. He took holy orders sometime before his death in Faenza, Italy in 1732. In addition to being a well-known soprano (of the cantabile style, singing mostly chamber music) and voice teacher, Tosi was a composer of several arias and cantatas.

==&quot;Opinioni de&#x27; cantori antichi, e moderni...&quot; [&quot;Observations on the Florid Song&quot;]==
&quot;Opinioni&quot; is primarily directed to the singing teacher, laying out what and how they must teach their pupils. It also includes a chapter and several passages addressed to the future professional singer with advice on good taste, ornaments, performance skills and the life and business of singing professionally. Tosi stresses the need for a long period of student training in reading and composing music, singing and constructing ornamentation, as well as in grammar, diction, social decorum and acting. All the standard ornaments of the time are thoroughly presented: &quot;appoggiatura,&quot; &quot;messa di voce,&quot; eight kinds of trills, &quot;passaggi (divisions),&quot; and &quot;portamento&quot;. Tosi also dedicates a chapter each to recitative and aria singing, preaching throughout the necessity of improvising one&#x27;s own graces and divisions on the spot in performances.

There are a few teachings of Tosi&#x27;s in his &quot;Opinioni&quot; that have been particularly interesting to singers and scholars over the years. Tosi clearly advocates uniting and blending the chest and head registers, the first recorded vocal pedagogue to do so. While earlier writers such as Zacconi and Caccini stated that singers ought to only sing in their “natural voice,” Tosi went so far as to say “[I]f [the chest and head register] do not perfectly unite, the Voice will be of divers Registers, and must consequently lose its Beauty.” Tosi&#x27;s is also the first recorded encouragement of the use of &quot;rubato&quot; as an embellishment. While he again and again rails on singers who accidentally sing out of tempo or self-aggrandizingly hold out notes as in the modern &quot;fermata,&quot; he encourages “[t]he stealing of Time […], provided he makes a Restitution with Ingenuity”; meaning, provided the singer catches back up the accompaniment, allowing them to keep tempo.

Another interesting element of &quot;Opinioni&quot; is Tosi&#x27;s discussions on intonation and &quot;sol-fa-ing.&quot; During a period in which various methods of temperament were used by keyboards, strings and even singers, Tosi laments that “except in some few Professors, that modern Intonation is very bad.” He speaks of a differing “Semitone Major and Minor” (or a larger and a smaller semitone) whose “[d]ifference cannot be known by an Organ or Harpsichord, if the Keys of the Instrument are not split.” Consequentially, he warns that “if a Soprano was to sing D sharp, like E flat, a nice Ear will find he is out of Tune, because this last rises.” Tosi&#x27;s remedy to poor intonation is to begin the singer young on &quot;solfege,&quot; using the traditional gamut created by Guido. While both the Guidonian hexachord system and meantone temperament were becoming antiquated at the time Tosi wrote his treatise, he nevertheless insisted on their use.

&quot;Opinioni&quot; was in fact a watershed for much more than just early Baroque music theory and tuning. Tosi spends a considerable amount of time in his treatise praising the “ancient” cantabile (or “Pathetick,” as the original translator put it) style of his generation, around the start of the 18th century. He cannot seem to understand why “the Mode” has moved to the rapid, highly ornate “Allegro” style popular at the time of his writing, which he lumps with insufficient singer training, ignoring the traditional Church modes and “tasteless” virtuosic displays as the great sin of the “modern” music generation. Being a pragmaticist, however, he still encourages “it will be of Use to a prudent Scholar, who is desirous to be expert in both Manners.”

<text>Vaslui (), a city in eastern Romania, is the seat of Vaslui County, in the historical region of Western Moldavia. The city administers five villages: Bahnari, Brodoc, Moara Grecilor, Rediu, and Viișoara.

==History==
Archaeological surveys indicate that the territory of Vaslui was inhabited since the Neolithic. From the 14th century onwards, it developed as the provincial town of Vaslui, with a population that fluctuated considerably in the following centuries. The name of Vaslui appears first in a Polish document from 1375, referring to Koriat&#x27;s son Yuri Koriatovich. The name &quot;Vaslui&quot; was also mentioned in 1435, in connection with the accession of Prince Iliaș to the Moldavian throne. The town was burned to the ground in 1439 and 1440 when Tatars invaded Moldavia.

The peak of Vaslui&#x27;s importance was in the 15th century, when it was a second-rank capital of Moldavia, during the reign of Stephen the Great (r. 1457–1504) and its population approached that of the neighbouring Iași. In 1475, Prince Stephen won his greatest battle against the Ottoman Empire in the Vaslui area. Once the Moldavian capital was moved from Suceava to Iași and the southern town of Bârlad became an administrative center of southern Moldavia, Vaslui declined for the next three centuries to eventually become a local borough (&quot;târg&quot;).
There once was a fairly large Jewish community in the city of Vaslui. Its arrival from Galicia during the second half of the 19th century gave a new impetus to local economic development. In 1899, Jews formed 37% of the population, and Vaslui was home to the &quot;Vasloi&quot; Hasidic dynasty. However, waves of pogroms, associated with the Holocaust (&quot;see Romania during World War II and Holocaust in Romania&quot;) as well as emigration to Israel during Romania&#x27;s communist period decimated this population.

During World War II, the Stephen the Great Monument was relocated from Chișinău to Vaslui. On 22 August 1944, Vaslui was captured by Soviet troops of the 2nd Ukrainian Front in the course of the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive.

The population of Vaslui grew steadily again after 1968, when the town was proclaimed as the administrative center of Vaslui County, with immigration from the neighbouring countryside, attracted by the industries set up by the Communist regime.

==Demographics==

According to the 2021 census, there were 63,035 people living within the city of Vaslui, making it the 40th largest city in Romania. The ethnic makeup was as follows: 98.63% Romanians, 1.19% Romani people, 0.06% Lipovans, and 0.12% other. The majority of the population is of Romanian ethnicity. Members of the Roma minority live compactly in the southwestern suburbs of Rediu and Brodoc, in the southwestern part of the main town (in the neighbourhoods around Traian Street) and also scattered in the rest of the locality. In the 1960s and &#x27;70s nomadic Roma belonging to the Kalderash caste were forcibly settled by the Communists in the northern part of the town, scattered among ethnic Romanians. The third ethnic group is that of the Lipovans, who have in the center of the town a church of their Old Believers Christian branch.

According to data provided by Romanian officials in 2017, the population of Vaslui was 100,170. The substantial increase compared to the 2011 census figures is because tens of thousands of dual citizens from neighboring Moldova come to Vaslui for their identity documents, where a Vaslui address is listed.

==Districts==
Vaslui has several neighborhoods: 13 Decembrie, Ana Ipătescu, Castanilor, Copou, Delea, Alecu Donici, Gheorghe Racoviță, Green Park, Gura Bustei and Traian.

==Education==
The city has ten schools, classes I – VIII, named after Ioan Cuza, Dimitrie Cantemir, Constantin Parfene, Elena Cuza, Ștefan cel Mare, Mihai Eminescu, Constantin Motaș, Alexandra Nechita, Vasile Alecsandri, Mihail Sadoveanu.

The city also has six high schools, named after Mihail Kogălniceanu, Emil Racoviță, Anghel Rugină, Ștefan Procopiu and Ion Mincu, as well as a Sports High School.

==Economy==
The main industries are textiles (clothing and knitted wear) and food (baked goods, vegetable oil, meat, dairy). There are also a number of shopping centers and supermarkets.

==Transport==

The is located in the south of the city. Originally designed by Anghel Saligny, it opened in 1886. The station was renovated in 2013.

In the city, public transport is provided by buses and taxis. In July 1994, a trolleybus line opened. It closed in July 2009, reopening in August 2016.

The national road passes through the city in a north-south direction (Iași-Bârlad). The road heads west to Bacău, and the road goes north-west to Piatra Neamț. European route E581 lies to the south-east.

==Sport==
Vaslui is home to FC Vaslui football club which played in Liga I until 2014, and HC Vaslui handball club which are playing in Liga Națională.

<text>The Ontario Agricultural College (OAC) originated at the agricultural laboratories of the Toronto Normal School, and was officially founded in 1874 as an associate agricultural college of the University of Toronto. Since 1964, it has become affiliated with the University of Guelph, which operates campuses in Guelph and Ridgetown and formerly in Alfred and Kemptville, all in Ontario.
==History==

Ontario farmers increasingly demanded more information on the best farming techniques which led to farm magazines and agricultural fairs. In 1868 the assembly created an agricultural museum, which morphed into the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph in 1874.
Its first building was Moreton Lodge, located where Johnston Hall now stands, which included classrooms, residences, a library, and a dining room. (Several buildings constructed during this time period are still a part of campus life today, including President&#x27;s Residence, Raithby House, and Day Hall.)

The War Memorial Hall is a landmark building built in June 1924 as a lecture hall or theatre at the Ontario Agricultural College to honour students who had enlisted and died in the First World War, and in the Second World War. Two bronze tablets in the Memorial Chapel remembers alumni who have died during these wars.

Subsequently, the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC) became one of three founding colleges of the University of Guelph in 1964. (The other two were the Ontario Veterinary College and the Macdonald Institute.)

The OAC opened on May 1, 1874, with an enrollment of 28 students. The OAC administration was housed in Moreton Lodge until 1931, when the building was torn down to make way for Johnston Hall. The OAC&#x27;s offices have resided in Johnston Hall ever since.

==Campuses==
In 1997, the provincial government amalgamated agriculture education across the province under the University of Guelph and OAC. Three previous Colleges of Agricultural Technology were now being run by the University of Guelph and OAC: &quot;College d&#x27;Alfred&quot;, a francophone college in the eastern part of the province at Alfred, Ontario; &quot;Kemptville College&quot;, founded in 1917 and located at Kemptville, Ontario about 30 minutes south of Ottawa, and Ridgetown College at Ridgetown, Ontario founded in 1922 and located in southwestern Ontario near Chatham. In May 2007, they were renamed Campus d&#x27;Alfred, Kemptville Campus and Ridgetown Campus in order to recognize their full integration into the university.
Serious changes took place in 2015 with the decision to close some OAC campuses, including the Campus of Alfred, the only francophone campus. Financial reasons and the challenge to run the same programs in multiple locations were among the reasons leading to restructuring.

==Programs==
The OAC offers a wide range of degree and diploma programs based on four main pillars: food, agriculture, environment, and rural communities. The following degrees and diplomas are available under the OAC:
*Associate Diploma
**Agriculture

== Community ==
The Student Federation of the Ontario Agricultural College (SFOAC) is the student government for all students studying in OAC&#x27;s programs. Each OAC class has a representative on SFOAC, and these representatives aim to promote spirit, leadership, enthusiasm and opportunity. With the sanction of the dean of the college, the SFOAC gives the student body of the OAC self-governance in matters pertaining to the student body, as well as distributing fees to classes and clubs within the OAC to promote activities.

Students enrolled in OAC programs connected to agriculture often refer to themselves as &#x27;Aggies&#x27;. They are known on and off campus for their strong sense of college pride, which is carried out through various traditions. Many generations of Aggies sport leather jackets. These jackets are ordered for each new class year and sport a class crest, class colours, class graduation year and their program of study. Aggies are also known for their weekly &#x27;pub nights&#x27; hosted on campus.

All students of the University of Guelph, including students of the OAC, participate in the tradition of painting Old Jeremiah.

== Special events ==

=== College Royal ===
An annual feature of the university is its open house, known as College Royal. The event began in 1925 and now welcomes over 20,000 visitors each year. For a weekend each March, every part of the campus and its programs are exhibited to the public, from the barns to the sugar bush in the Arboretum. It is highly popular with visitors of all ages, especially families with children who take advantage of the March Break (the usual Ontario school break) to have an outing. For students, College Royal is a 12-day long experience including events such as Fashion Show, Kick-Off Pub and Super Thursday.

=== Tractor Tug for Tots ===
Tractor Tug for Tots is an event run by the Tractor Tug for Tots club of the Student Federation of the Ontario Agricultural College. The annual charity event raises funds for youth organizations each year by having teams pay to compete against each other in pulling tractors down Reynolds Walk.

=== Good Times ===
Good Times is annual banquet held for OAC students, staff, donors and alumni. The banquet includes a full dinner as well as an awards ceremony recognizing outstanding members of the OAC. Good Times is said to be a favourite event by many of the OAC ‘Aggies’.

=== LABash ===
The LABash is an annual conference originally started by three landscape architecture students at the University of Guelph. This multi-day event is coordinated for landscape architecture students from all across North America and provides students with the opportunity to discuss current landscape architecture trends while networking with fellow students and professionals.

=== Environmental Sciences Symposium ===
The Environmental Sciences Symposium is an annual event organized and hosted by students on the Environmental Sciences Student Executive (ESSE). The day brings together students, experts, and community members to learn about an environmental theme through workshops and discussions that incorporate science and social science perspectives.

<doc id="385729" wikidata="Q180362" url="?curid=385729" title="Sacrilege">
<text>Sacrilege is the violation or injurious treatment of a sacred object, site or person. This can take the form of irreverence to sacred persons, places, and things. When the sacrilegious offence is verbal, it is called blasphemy, and when physical, it is often called desecration. In a more general sense, any transgression against what is seen as the virtue of religion would be a sacrilege, and so is coming near a sacred site without permission.

Most ancient religions have a concept analogous to sacrilege, often considered as a type of taboo. The basic idea is that realm of sacrum or haram stands above the world of the profane and its instantiations, see the Sacred–profane dichotomy.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;sacrilege&quot; originates from the Latin &quot;sacer&quot;, meaning sacred, and &quot;legere&quot;, meaning to steal. In Roman times, it referred to the plundering of temples and graves. By the time of Cicero, sacrilege had adopted a more expansive meaning, including verbal offences against religion and the undignified treatment of sacred objects.

Owing to the phonetic similarities between the words &quot;sacrilegious&quot; and &quot;religious&quot;, and their spiritually-based uses in modern English, many people mistakenly assume that the two words are etymologically linked, or that one is an antonym of the other. Religious is derived from the Latin word &quot;religio&quot;, meaning &quot;reverence, religion&quot;, (from &quot;religare&quot;, &quot;to bind [to the god{s}]&quot;; Tully derived it from &quot;re-&quot; [again] and &quot;legere&quot; [to read]), whereas &quot;sacrilegious&quot; is derived ultimately from the Latin combining form &quot;sacr-&quot;, meaning sacred, and the verb &quot;legere&quot;, meaning &quot;to steal&quot;, &quot;to collect&quot;, or &quot;to read&quot;. The Latin noun &quot;sacrilegus&quot; thus means &quot;one who steals sacred things&quot;.1

==Christianity==

With the advent of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, the Emperor Theodosius criminalized sacrilege in an even more expansive sense, including heresy, schism, and offenses against the emperor, such as tax evasion.

By the Middle Ages, the concept of sacrilege was again restricted to physical acts against sacred objects, and this forms the basis of all subsequent Catholic teachings on the subject. A major offence was to tamper with a consecrated host, otherwise known as the &quot;Body of Christ&quot;. Additionally, Bible desecration has resulted in prosecution.

Most modern nations have abandoned laws against sacrilege out of respect for freedom of expression, except in cases where there is an injury to persons or property. In the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Burstyn v. Wilson&quot; (1952) struck down a statute against sacrilege, ruling that the term could not be narrowly defined in a way that would safeguard against the establishment of one church over another and that such statutes infringed upon the free exercise of religion and freedom of expression.

Despite their decriminalisation, sacrilegious acts are still sometimes regarded with strong disapproval by the public, even by nominal or former members and non-adherents of the offended religion, especially when these acts are perceived as manifestations of hatred toward a particular sect or creed.

=== Catholic Church ===
According to Catholic theology sacrilege is classified as personal, local, or real.

Personal sacrilege is irreverence shown to a person consecrated by religious vows (monks, nuns, etc.) or by holy orders (deacons, priests, bishops). Ridiculing, mocking, or abusing members of the clergy is considered personal sacrilege, as often the animosity is directed not at the person themselves but at the Church or at God whom they represent. Whenever those in religious or clerical life violate the sixth Commandment and break their vow of chastity, it is considered a personal sacrilege on their part. Laying violent hands on a cleric used to incur an automatic excommunication according to the 1917 Code of Canon Law. Since 1983, only someone who physically attacks the pope is excommunicated.

Local sacrilege is the violation and desecration of sacred places and space. Robbing or vandalizing a church, chapel, oratory, convent, or monastery would be of this category. It could also be committing immoral and sinful acts inside a sacred building, such as murder or sexual acts. The 1917 Code considered the burial of a publicly excommunicated person in a Catholic cemetery or hallowed ground to be sacrilege. The current 1983 Code makes no mention of it.

Real sacrilege is the contemptuous irreverence shown for sacred things, especially the Seven Sacraments or anything used for divine worship (altars, vestments, chalices, tabernacles, et al.). This can happen first of all by the administration or reception of the sacraments in the state of mortal sin, as such as receiving Communion, as also by advertently doing any of those things invalidly. Using sacred vessels for secular use, such as a chalice to drink cocktails, or using common items like paper plates and Styrofoam cups for liturgical worship, are also examples of real sacrilege. The worst kind is desecration of the Blessed Sacrament, as it is the most important and most sacred item in Catholicism (far more than any relic or historical artifact whatsoever).

==England and Wales==
In Post-Reformation England, sacrilege was a criminal offence for centuries, though its statutory definition varied considerably. Most English dictionaries of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries appealed to the primary sense of stealing objects from a church.

Criminal law was consolidated by Peel&#x27;s Acts from 1828. Of these, 7 &amp; 8 Geo 4 c 27 repealed the provisions of 1 Ed 6 c 12 in relation to sacrilege, while two created new laws around larceny: 7 &amp; 8 Geo 4 c 29 for England and Wales, and 9 Geo 4 c 55 for Ireland. Section 10 of each was identical:

Both of those sections were replaced by section 50 of the Larceny Act 1861, which was described by its marginal note as &quot;breaking and entering a church or chapel and committing any felony&quot; and which read:

This offence was not triable at quarter sessions

Section 50 of the Larceny Act 1861 was repealed by section 48(1) of, and the schedule to, the Larceny Act 1916. It was replaced by section 24 of the Larceny Act 1916 which provided:

The words &quot;arrestable offence&quot; were substituted for the word &quot;felony&quot;, in subsections (1) and (2), by section 10(1) of, and paragraph 12(1) of Schedule 2 to, the Criminal Law Act 1967.

Section 24 was replaced by sections 9 and 10 of the Theft Act 1968 (which create the offences of burglary and aggravated burglary).

==As violence, self-harm and pride== 

Violence against God was the sign of arrogance which brought attributes of a divine nature down to the material world, while their existence belonged to gods and thus was inviolable.

<doc id="385730" wikidata="Q6682002" url="?curid=385730" title="Los Angeles Christmas Festival">
<text>The Los Angeles Christmas Festival was a post-season college football bowl game played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California, on December 25, 1924, between the USC Trojans and the Missouri Tigers. It was the first and only Festival game ever played, in a time where bowl games were a fairly new concept. It was Missouri&#x27;s first bowl appearance and USC&#x27;s second, having last played in the 1923 Rose Bowl.

==Proposed revival==

A group led by Derek Dearwater looked to create a new Christmas Bowl in 2010. According to Dearwater, the game was supposed to pit the Pac-10&#x27;s No. 7 team (or a school from the Mid-American Conference if the Pac-10 didn&#x27;t have any more bowl-eligible squads) against the Western Athletic Conference&#x27;s No. 2 team. The L.A. Coliseum was the planned venue, either on Christmas Eve or the following Monday, December 27. The Children&#x27;s Miracle Network (&quot;Creating Christmas Miracles for Children in Need&quot;) was to be the game&#x27;s chief benefactor.

However, the bowl proposal &quot;fell short of meeting the NCAA&#x27;s licensing criteria due to an inability to secure a back-up conference agreement&quot; for the Pac-10&#x27;s No. 7 selection. The game applied to the NCAA for certification in 2011 and again in 2014, unsuccessfully.

In 2019, the Los Angeles Bowl was announced, with the game to be played at the new SoFi Stadium.

<doc id="385732" wikidata="Q5281746" url="?curid=385732" title="Discouraged worker">
<text>In economics, a discouraged worker is a person of legal employment age who is not actively seeking employment or who has not found employment after long-term unemployment, but who would prefer to be working. This is usually because an individual has given up looking, hence the term &quot;discouraged&quot;.

A discouraged worker, since not actively seeking employment, has fallen out of the core statistics of the unemployment rate since they are neither working nor job-seeking. Their giving up on job-seeking may derive from a variety of factors including a shortage of jobs in their locality or line of work; discrimination for reasons such as age, race, sex, religion, sexual orientation, and disability; a lack of necessary skills, training, or experience; a chronic illness or disability; or simply a lack of success in finding a job.

As a general practice, discouraged workers, who are often classified as &quot;marginally attached to the labor force&quot;, &quot;on the margins&quot; of the labor force, or as part of &quot;hidden unemployment&quot;, are not considered part of the labor force, and are thus not counted in most official unemployment rates—which influences the appearance and interpretation of unemployment statistics.

One of the reasons why people become discouraged workers is discrimination in the workplace. The research found that minorities are more likely to become discouraged workers due to discrimination. The minorities, such as African Americans, ethnic and racial minorities in Europe, and older workers, tend to become discouraged workers more than others. Discrimination leads workers to be discouraged workers because discrimination caused feelings of helplessness and uncontrollability and decreases a level of self-efficacy. The studies of discouraged workers are undertaken, as it is seen as &quot;hidden unemployment&quot;. However, it is related to major social problems like minority discrimination and the lack of a diverse community.

There are not significant behavioral patterns of labor force participation across age-sex groups in the business cycle. It is related to the unemployment rate in the region. Generally, the discouraged worker effect gets stronger when the unemployment rate exceeds a certain level. Young workers are most dependent on the business cycle, regarding the decision of whether to participate in the labor force. There is a linear relationship only among the prime-age female between the added workers and the discouraged workers. The discouraged worker effects appear more for older workers during the exception phase, which is the phase when the unemployment rates of workers departed.

==United States==

In the United States, a discouraged worker is defined as a person not in the labor force who wants and is available for a job and who has looked for work sometime in the past 12 months (or since the end of his or her last job if a job was held within the past 12 months), but who is not currently looking because of real or perceived poor employment prospects.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not count discouraged workers as unemployed but rather refers to them as only &quot;marginally attached to the labor force&quot;. This means that the officially measured unemployment captures so-called &quot;frictional unemployment&quot; and not much else. This has led some economists to believe that the actual unemployment rate in the United States is higher than what is officially reported while others suggest that discouraged workers voluntarily choose not to work. Nonetheless, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has published the discouraged worker rate in alternative measures of labor underutilization under U-4 since 1994 when the most recent redesign of the CPS was implemented.

The United States Department of Labor first began tracking discouraged workers in 1967 and found 500,000 at the time. Today, In the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics as of April 2009, there are 740,000 discouraged workers. There is an ongoing debate as to whether discouraged workers should be included in the official unemployment rate. Over time, it has been shown that a disproportionate number of young people, blacks, Hispanics, and men make up discouraged workers. Nonetheless, it is generally believed that the number of discouraged workers is underestimated because it does not include homeless people or those who have not looked for or held a job during the past twelve months and is often poorly tracked.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the top five reasons for discouragement are the following:
#The worker thinks no work is available.
#The worker could not find work.
#The worker lacks schooling or training.
#The worker is viewed as too young or too old by the prospective employer.
#The worker is the target of various types of discrimination.

As the world navigates through the effects of the global coronavirus pandemic, a growing number of job seekers in the United States are becoming discouraged, leaving the labor force entirely, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of government data. The number of Americans who are out of work and have experienced long-term unemployment, while still continuing to look for a job for more than six months, has increased considerably in the year since the start of the COVID-19 recession. During periods of economic weakness, the labor force participation rate in the United States has tended to decline during economic downturns. During the 2007–09 recession, the unemployment rate for discouraged workers more than doubled. From late 2007 to early 2011, the number of discouraged workers increased from about 350,000 to a peak of about 1.3 million. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports that the lingering effects of the 2007–2009 recession and the slow recovery will continue to restrain participation. The effects of the coronavirus greatly impacted the United States economy. Pew Research Center reports that overall, 25% of U.S. adults say they or someone in their household was laid off or lost their job because of the coronavirus outbreak, with 15% saying this happened to them personally. Nearly 529,000 Americans were classified as discouraged workers in February 2021, roughly 100,000 more than the number one year ago. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, labor market participation rate sharply declined due to the lack of job opportunities that perpetuated discourage people from searching for employment. Like most economic crisis as the labor market improves and jobs becomes more plentiful, unemployed workers will reenter the labor force. CBO expects that discouraged workers are likely to continue to reenter the labor force as more people find jobs and wage growth increases.

==Canada==
In Canada, discouraged workers are often referred to as &quot;hidden unemployed&quot; because of their behavioral pattern, and are often described as &quot;on the margins&quot; of the labour force. Since the numbers of discouraged workers and of unemployed generally move in the same direction during the business cycle and the seasons (both tend to rise in periods of low economic activity and vice versa), some economists have suggested that discouraged workers should be included in the unemployment numbers because of the close association.

The information on the number and composition of the discouraged worker group in Canada originates from two main sources. One source is the monthly Labour Force Survey (LFS), which is a monthly survey that provides an estimate of both employment and unemployment. The LFS’ definition of discouraged workers has not changed since 1997. It is defined as people who were willing and available to work during the reference week but did not work because they believed there was no suitable work available. The other source is the Survey of Job Opportunities (SJO), which is much closer in design to the approach used in many other countries. In this survey, all those expressing a desire for work and who are available for work are counted, irrespective of their past job search activity.

In Canada, while discouraged workers were once less educated than &quot;average workers&quot;, they now have better training and education but still tend to be concentrated in areas of high unemployment. Discouraged workers are not seeking a job for one of two reasons: labour market-related reasons (worker discouragement, waiting for recall to a former job or waiting for replies to earlier job search efforts) and personal and other reasons (illness or disability, personal or family responsibilities, going to school, and so on).

The table below uses the data from the LFS since 2016. Unemployment was slowly rising from the year 2016 where it was 10,115,700 people to 2019 where the number increased to 10,555,000 people. Similar to the rest of the world, the Covid-19 pandemic caused an even greater increase in the total unemployment, affecting a high of 11,156,000 people. Among the set of the population classified as discouraged workers, there is a greater rise, going from 21,800 people in 2019 to 70,400 in 2020.

LFS Reason for not looking for work x 1000: Both sexes, ages 15 and older.

It is worth noting that there is a vast population of Aboriginal people that reside in Canada. Canada classifies the following three groups under the broad term Aboriginal: the First Nations, Inuit, and the Metis. Statistics Canada does not measure Aboriginal unemployment separate from the population as a whole, but the Aboriginal people make up a big portion of the unemployed and discouraged worker count. The 2008 recession hit the Aboriginals harder than the rest of the population, which created a pattern of high rates of unemployment and discouraged workers.

The Aboriginal have greater restrictions to work than the normal population due to race, lower human capital, and education. These factors subject the population to more part-time-part-year work, layoffs, job loss and lower pay. Dealing with this over time produces more discouraged workers, and produces a smaller labor force participation. Aboriginal peoples were three times as likely to be discouraged workers than the rest of the population.

== Australia ==
In Australia, discouraged workers are recorded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) into a category of potential workers who are not actively seeking work. In order to be categorized as discouraged, individuals must a) want to work, b) be available to start working within 4 weeks, and c) are not actively applying for jobs because they are discouraged. According to ABS, there were 808,000 persons classified as unemployed in February 2021 plus an additional 1.157 million marginally attached to the labor force. The 113,000 discouraged workers fall into this marginally attached group.

The top three reasons that discouraged workers in Australia did not actively seek work in the week prior were:

# Considered too young or too old by employers
# No jobs in locality, line of work or no jobs at all
# No jobs in suitable hours

The table below shows how there has been an overall increase in the number of discouraged workers in Australia, even with decreases from 2015 to 2016 and again from 2018 to 2019. As with many other countries, the number of discouraged workers increases during times of economic downturn which would explain the increases seen in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, women are more likely to be discouraged workers than men in Australia.

The Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research (CAEPR) at The Australian National University has done further research of discouraged workers within Australia’s Indigenous population. As discussed by Hunter and Gray, Indigenous Australians are more than three times more likely to become discouraged than the Australian population as a whole. Similar to what is seen in the entire Australian population, Indigenous females experience higher rates of discouraged workers as compared to males. The top two reasons for becoming discouraged for the indigenous population as a whole were “childcare and other family responsibilities” and “studying/returning to studies.”

==European Union==
Unemployment statistics published according to the ILO methodology may understate actual unemployment in the economy. The EU statistical bureau EUROSTAT started publishing figures on discouraged workers in 2010. According to the method used by EUROSTAT there are 3 categories that make up discouraged workers;
* underemployed part-time workers
* jobless persons seeking a job but not immediately available for work,
* persons available for work but not seeking it

The first group are contained in the employed statistics of the European Labour Force Survey while the second two are contained in the inactive persons statistics of that survey.
In 2012 there were 9.2 million underemployed part-time workers, 2.3 million jobless persons seeking a job but not immediately available for work, and 8.9 million persons available for work but not seeking it, an increase of 0.6 million for underemployed and 0.3 million for the two groups making up discouraged workers.

If the discouraged workers and underemployed are added to official unemployed statistics Spain has the highest number real unemployed (8.4 Million), followed by Italy (6.4 Million), United Kingdom (5.5 Million), France (4.8 Million) and Germany (3.6 Million).

== India ==
The discouraged worker effects in India are divided into two concepts, unexplained gender wage gap and degree of underemployment. The discouraged worker effects are related to the recession in the business cycle, mainly affecting women or the secondary income earners in the household. Gender discrimination in the labor market, the lack of job opportunities, and the wage gap discourage women from entering the labor force in India.
In Kerala, India, it worsened the female-to-male wage ratio between 2004 and 2012, which is one of the causes why it generated discouraged women workers. The discouraged worker effect of the wage gap was 2.6% in 2011/12 in India, which is the ratio of a 1% increase in the wage gap. This ratio of the wage gap for India exceeds the ratio for the Republic of Korea and Japan.

Gender imbalance for the participation rate is historically lower in the southern states than in the northern states. For example, the participation rate was 21% for all all-India of, whereas 25% was in Andhra Pradesh, which is in the south of India, and 14% in Uttar Pradesh, which is in the north of India. The participation rate for Kerala was 42%, which is much higher than the national average, while the rate for Uttarakhand was 21% in 2011/12. The participation rate of the labor force for women is higher in western and southern states than in central India. The participation rate is positively related to the education level. As the education level reached to graduate, the probability of labor force entry increased by 5.7% in 2011/12.

<text>The labor force is the actual number of people available for work and is the sum of the employed and the unemployed. The U.S. labor force reached a record high of 170.7 million civilians in January 2025. In February 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, there were 164.6 million civilians in the labor force. Before the pandemic, the U.S. labor force had risen each year since 1960 with the exception of the period following the Great Recession, when it remained below 2008 levels from 2009 to 2011. In 2021, The Great Resignation resulted in record numbers in voluntary turnover for American workers. 

The labor force participation rate, LFPR (or economic activity rate, EAR), is the ratio between the labor force and the overall size of their cohort (national population of the same age range). Much as in other countries in the West, the labor force participation rate in the U.S. increased significantly during the later half of the 20th century, largely due to women entering the workplace in increasing numbers. Labor force participation has declined steadily since 2000, primarily because of the aging and retirement of the Baby Boom generation. Analyzing labor force participation trends in the prime working age (25-54) cohort helps separate the impact of an aging population from other demographic factors (e.g., gender, race, and education) and government policies. The Congressional Budget Office explained in 2018 that higher educational attainment is correlated with higher labor force participation for workers aged 25 to 54. Prime-aged men who are out of the labor force tend to be out due to disability, while a key reason for women is caring for family members.

==Definition==
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) defines the labor force as:

Included are persons 16 years of age and older residing in the 50 States and the District of Columbia who are not inmates of institutions (for example, penal and mental facilities, homes for the aged), and who are not on active duty in the Armed Forces.

==Gender and the U.S. labor force==
===Women===
In the United States, there were three significant stages of women&#x27;s increased participation in the labor force. During the late 19th century through the 1920s, very few women were employed. Working women were often young single women who typically withdrew from labor force at marriage unless their family needed two incomes. These women worked primarily in the textile manufacturing industry or as domestic workers.

Between 1930 and 1950, female labor force participation increased primarily due to increased demand for office workers, the high school movement, and electrification, which reduced the time spent on household chores. In the 1950s to the 1970s, most women were secondary earners working mainly as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians (pink-collar jobs).

Starting from 1960, the world and the U.S. witnessed a significant increase in female LFP in the labor market, especially in developed countries such as Europe and the U.S. According to Congressional Research Service, the gap for LFP between women and men has been smaller since 1979. The cumulative percentage change in real wages for women increased by 9.6%, while for men it decreased by 7.7%, but still remained higher than that of women. Only men with bachelor&#x27;s degrees or higher averaged higher actual earnings than women.

Claudia Goldin and others, specifically point out that by the mid-1970s there was a period of revolution of women in the labor force brought on by different factors. In the United States, the LFP rate rose from approximately 59% in 1948 to 66% in 2005, with participation among women rising from 32% to 59% and participation among men declining from 87% to 73%.

A common theory in modern economics claims that the rise of women participating in the US labor force in the late 1960s was due to the introduction of a new contraceptive technology, birth control pills, and the adjustment of age of majority laws. According to the University of Chicago Press Journal, there was a significant change in women&#x27;s first marriage and education careers. Most women interviewees answered that the change was because of the pill. However, from 1980, married women were willing to work regardless of their husband&#x27;s employment situation. However, only 40% of the population actually used the birth control pill.

Another factor that may have contributed to the trend was the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex. Such legislation diminished sexual discrimination and encouraged more women to enter the labor market by receiving fair remuneration to help raise children. The 1964 Civil Rights Act and Title IX in 1972 also increased women&#x27;s LFP. The Equal Pay Act protects both men and women against discrimination on account of sex in the payments of wages.

According to Claire Cain Miller, NYT, other wealthy countries, such as Denmark, Germany, and Norway, spend an average of $14,000 annually for childcare while the U.S. government supports only $500.

====Historical trends====

According to the US Census in 1861, one third of women were in the labor force and of these one fourth were married women.

According to Ellen DuBoise and Lynn Dumenil, they estimate that the number of women in the labor force from 1800 - 1900 are:

According to the US Department of Labor and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics:

According to the US Department of Labor, as of 2017 women make up 47% of the total labor force with 70% of them mothers with children under 18 years of age.

===Men===
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, men&#x27;s LFP decreased since 1950 with 86.4%, 79.7% in 1970, 76.4% in 1990, and 73.3% in 2005. In addition, a decline in male education participation, age of marriage, the rise of substance abuse, and addiction to video games could lead to a decrease in Men LFP.

According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, from 1996 to 2015, men in the prime age with a high-school degree or associate&#x27;s degree have a nonparticipation rate much higher than those holding advanced degrees. During the Great Recession, overall, the nonparticipation rate increased for everyone regardless of their education level, but the greatest increase was for those with only a high school diploma.

The aging in the U.S. population also explained the decrease in Men LFP. The median age of males increased from 34 years old to 37.2 years old with more people over 65 years old and fewer people of labor age. According to the 2020 Current Population Survey, most men who were out of the labor force self-reported they could not work due to illness, disability, or due to attending higher education. Regarding the Social Security Disability Program, 35% of recipients responded their disability was due to mental health disorder. Another 30% responded their disability correlated to musculoskeletal disorders, many of which are due to obesity.

Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s LFP rate increased after COVID-19. According to Science Advances, more than half of unemployed men in their 30s have a criminal arrest history.

====Historical Trends====
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics:

== Race and the U.S. Labor Force ==

=== Occupation ===
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2019 Asians are most likely to hold a management position, while Hispanics or Latinos are most likely to hold a job in the service sector.

According to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, male LFP decreased and has continued decreasing since 1950 with 86.4%, 79.7% in 1970, 76.4% in 1990, and 73.3% in 2005. Experts predict that this decrease could remain and become higher over the years because of different policies such as the Social Security Act (1960). In addition, a decline in male education participation, age of marriage, the rise of substance abuse, and addiction to video gaming could lead to the decrease in male LFP. This decrease in male labor force participation rate was probably from the benefit of disability insurance, especially in the group of less-educated men.

According to the article &quot;Why are prime-age men vanishing from the labor force?&quot; (Economic review , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, first quarter 2018), author found that from 1996 to 2015, most men in the prime-age who only hold a high-school degree or associate&#x27;s degree would have a nonparticipation rate much higher than those who hold an advanced degree. There were studies that showed that the demand in low-skilled workers had been down during 1970 to 1980. Alternatively, the demand of middle-skilled labors during that period of time increased significantly, this could be explained since organizations tried to replace the low-skilled workers and used middle-skilled workers. During the Great Recession, overall, the nonparticipation rate increased for everyone regardless of their education level. However, the author tried to dig deeper and categorized men into four different groups: those, who do not have a high school diploma, who have a high school diploma, who have an associate&#x27;s degree, and who have a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. It was obvious that the greatest increase was from the group with only a high school diploma.

The aging in U.S population also explained the decrease in Men LFP. The median-age of male was increased from 34 years old to 37.2 years old. In addition, baby-boomer numbers increased which meant more people over 65 years old, and fewer people who were of labor age. With these numbers, even though the labor force participation rate remained same, the aging in population still could affect and drag the LFPR down. According to the 2020 Current Population Survey, most men reported that they were not able to work due to higher education, ill health, or disability, however, this is a self-report. Regarding the Social Security Disability Program, 35% of recipients responded that their disability was due to mental health disorder. According to National Library of Medicine, the percentage of men diagnosed with depression was lower than women, yet the effect on the male labor force participation rate was considerable. There were different reasons leading to this, it could be unrecognized, undiagnosed, and untreated. Another 30% responded that their disability correlated to musculoskeletal disorder, much due to obesity.

The men LFPR tend to increase further after COVID-19. Experts said that there are many reasons could lead to this results. People within the age that about to retire would like to retire earlier, even though they are healthy, they would prefer to spend their time for family, hobbies, or voluntary. In addition, COVID-19 created a threat to most people, especially who have problem with their health before. Another reason could be many companies are trying to move their plant to different countries where could cut companies&#x27; costs and benefits. According to Science Advances, more than half of men in their 30s has a criminal history arrest. This could be another reason explains why men nonparticipation rate increases. 
=== Health Inequalities in the Labor Force ===
A person&#x27;s occupation is one of the main social determinants of health which greatly contributes to health inequalities and health disparities, racially and ethnically. Determinants under the occupation category include: income, housing, paid sick leave and health insurance; they are related to a person&#x27;s socioeconomic status. The U.S. health care system is connected to employment and it is very likely that a worker is paying for health insurance through their employer; low-wage workers who opt for coverage through their employment pay a higher portion from their income than their middle- income and higher- income counterparts. There is a disproportionate number of employed workers, based on race across the labor sectors, especially those of high- risk.

Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance

The updated data from U.S Census Bureau in September 2022 does not change or is slightly different compared to last year&#x27;s period. Three factors are being discussed:

* The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM)
* People with Health Insurance coverage
* Household Income

The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). According to Congressional Research Service, SPM is a measure of economic deprivation. This tool helps to collect, effort, and report the data of individuals, households, etc., living with a lack of financial resources to reach a certain standard of living. Poverty thresholds are family size and composition. People will be considered their poverty status based on their financial resources against the thresholds. Those whose financial resources are lower than thresholds will be regarded as poor. In 2021, the official poverty rate was 11.6%, equal to 37.9 million people in poverty, and SPM was 7.8%, slightly decreasing compared with 9.2% in 2020 and 11.7% in 2019. SPM in 2021 was also the lowest rate since 2009.

Health Insurance Coverage. There are two sector, public and private insurance. According to Center for Disease Control and Prevention statistics, in 2021, 13.5% of people aged 18–64 were uninsured, 39.5% used public insurance, and 60.4% used private insurance. Even though personal insurance coverage is more common than public insurance coverage, and people typically change insurance type during the calendar year, in 2021, the percentage of general insurance coverage will be higher than private compared to 2020. The data from the National Center for Health Statistics, the ratio of adult aged from 18 to 64 that are uninsured tend to decrease and is related to households&#x27; income level. The percentage of uninsured people from 18 to 64 fell and significantly decreased as the following 24.5%, 23.7%, and 8.4%. The Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is divided into less than 100%, above 100%, less than 200%, and 200%.

Income. Similarly to SPM, there is no significant change in revenue in 2021 compared to 2020, $70,784 vs. $71,186. Although the total number of workers in both years is the same, the status of employees tends to move from part-time to full-time employees in 2021. Part-time employees have higher median earnings than full-time employees, about 4.1%.

==== During COVID-19 ====
The Family First Coronavirus Act (FFCRA), provided mandated paid sick leave for workers that are impacted by COVID-19 and people of color are affected since because of the exemptions in that law; only certain public employers, private employers of less than 500 employees, and small business with less than 50 employees may qualify for the mandate. COVID-19 affected workers disproportionately, with Black and non-White races more likely to make up the baseline of the essential workforce this exposes to them to infections causing them to be unable to or to continue to work; FFCRA (2020) was passed in hopes of protecting workers but the ambiguity of the law puts minorities&#x27; paid sick leave at risk. Less than 30% of the workforce in the United States have paid sick leave that is protected by state law

==Analyzing the labor force participation rate==
===Overall rate===
From 1962 to 1999, women entering the U.S. workforce represented a nearly 8 percentage point increase in the overall LFPR, which may be at least partly due to rising educational attainment level among women. Higher labor force participation is correlated with higher educational attainment. 

The overall LFPR has been falling in the U.S. since its all-time high point of 67.3% reached in January–April 2000, reaching 62.7% by January 2018. This decline since 2000 is primarily driven by the retirement of the Baby Boom generation. Since the overall labor force is defined as those age 16+, an aging society with more persons past the typical prime working age (25-54) exerts a steady downward influence on the LFPR. The decline was forecast by economists and demographers going back into the 1990s, if not earlier. For example, during 1999 the BLS forecast that the overall LFPR would be 66.9% in 2015 and 63.2% in 2025. A 2006 forecast by Federal Reserve economists (before the Great Recession that began in December 2007) estimated the LFPR would be below 64% by 2016, close to the 62.7% average that year.

The LFPR decreases when the percentage increase in the defined population (denominator) is greater than the percentage increase in the labor force (i.e., the sum of employed and unemployed, the numerator). With respect to the unemployment rate, if the percentage increase in the number of unemployed (numerator) is greater than the percentage increase in the number in the labor force (denominator), the unemployment rate will rise.

===Prime working age rate===

Economists also analyze the LFPR for those prime-aged workers, aged 25–54. Mathematically, this ratio is the total civilian labor force age 25–54 divided by the total civilian population of that age cohort. The prime-aged LFPR peaked at 84.5% at three times between October 1997 and April 2000. Prior to the Great Recession, the rate was 83.3% in November 2007, then fell to a trough of 80.5% in July 2015, before steadily climbing back to 81.7% in January 2018. It is one of the few key labor market variables that had yet to recover its pre-crisis level as of January 2018 and is an indicator of slack in the labor market.

*Men&#x27;s prime-aged labor force participation has been falling consistently since at least the 1960s. It ranged between 93% and 95% during the 1980s, fell to around 90% during the 2000s and was 88.5% in October 2017.
*Women&#x27;s prime-aged labor force participation rose consistently from at least the early 1960s, reaching a peak of 77.2% in August 1997. It has fluctuated around 75% since then.

=== Teen labor force participation ===
The LFPR peaked in 1979 in the U.S. AT 57.9%. In the early 21st century, there was a continued decrease in the teen LFPR, which was expected to continue to decline from 2017 to 2024, at least partly due to more young people attending college rather than entering the workforce.

According to a Pew Research Center analysis on monthly 1944-2017 Current Population Survey, Millennials aged 16+ represented the largest generation in the U.S. labor force and the highest quote since the postwar, with more than 35% of participants working or looking for a work.

=== Participation during COVID-19 ===
The COVID-19 pandemic led to a massive drop in persons in the labor force. According to Pew Research Center, from February 2020 to February 2021 an estimated 4.2 million people left the labor force because of COVID-19, 2.4 million of which were women. As a result, women&#x27;s participation in the labor force was at a 30-year low.

==== The Great Resignation ====


The pandemic created a shift in the labor market where workers began voluntarily leaving their jobs in large numbers. By July 2021, 4 million workers had voluntarily separated from their employer. A number of factors were impacting the trend which started in early 2021. With the risks associated with returning to unsafe working conditions, lack of childcare, and overall employee burnout, employers were experiencing higher turnover rates with little evidence of slowdown. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, all industries in the U.S. labor market were impacted with highest numbers in hospitality and healthcare, while construction, mining, and oil/gas industries saw little to no impact. A Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) survey found that younger people were less likely to leave the workforce than older generations. 

A shift in worker attitudes, overall priorities, and perception of their relationship with their jobs was a symptom of the pandemic, which forced many to drastically change the way they work and live. For example, some workers developed a quiet quitting mindset by deliberately limiting their work activities to formal job descriptions, meeting yet not exceeding the preestablished expectations, and never volunteering for additional tasks.

==Foreign-born workers==

There were 27.8 million foreign-born workers in the labor force as of January 2018. This group had an overall LFPR of 65.1% in January 2018. As of 2013, the highest group of people participating in the Foreign-born immigrant labor force in the United States were individuals from Mexico and Central America. They made up of 40.3 percent of the immigrant labor force participation. Mexico heavily outweighed Central America in which they held the majority of workers with 32 percent of workers just from Mexico. In 2013, California held most of the foreign-born worker immigrants in the United States, with about half from Mexico and Central America.

=== Foreign-born women ===
People who stay in the United States but were not born in the U.S. is considered foreign-born. In most cases, they were born in different countries with parents who were not U.S. citizens. Hispanic makes up almost haft of foreign-born workers in the labor market. According to the News Release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, foreign-born added more than 670,000 in 2021. This number was unchanged for the native-born. Regarding gender, foreign-born men contributed to the market more than men native-born in 2021, with 76.8%, and women&#x27;s foreign-born rate is lower than women native-born at 56.6%. Regarding median earnings, foreign-born workers tend to be paid less than native-born workers, with weekly payments of $898 and $1,017, respectively.

Since 1960, foreign-born immigrant women have the lowest labor market participation rate between all of the groups in the United States. The groups include immigrant men and individuals born in the United States. Foreign-born immigrant women participate in the labor force between 75 and 78 percent lower than native born males. In terms of labor force participation, the foreign-born immigrant women from Mexico and Central America are the smallest number of participants in the labor force. As far as foreign-born immigrants that are trying to participate in the labor force but cannot find employment, the unemployment rates are as follows. The unemployment are foreign-born immigrant women workers (9.1 percent), native women workers (7.9 percent), Mexico and Central American foreign-born immigrant women workers (12.1 percent), and other foreign-born immigrant women workers (7.7 percent).

=== Foreign-born men ===
In terms of labor force participation, the foreign-born immigrant men from Mexico and Central America are the largest number of participants in the labor force. The number of potential labor force participants for foreign-born immigrant men are foreign-born immigrant men workers (9.9 percent), native men workers (10.4 percent), Mexico and Central American foreign-born immigrant men workers (11.4 percent), and other foreign-born immigrant men workers (8.6 percent). Foreign-born immigrant men have a similar unemployment rate to native workers, but the unemployment rate for foreign-born immigrant men that are from Mexico and Central America is considerably more than other groups of foreign-born immigrant men looking for work in the United States.

==International comparison==
For 2017, the Central Intelligence Agency ranked the U.S. as having the fourth largest labor force in the world at about 160 million, behind China (807 million), India (522 million), and the European Union (235 million).

<doc id="385738" wikidata="Q2890025" url="?curid=385738" title="Battle of Solway Moss">
<text>The Battle of Solway Moss took place on Solway Moss near the River Esk on the English side of the Anglo-Scottish border in November 1542 between English and Scottish forces.

The Scottish King James V had refused to break from the Catholic Church, as urged by his uncle King Henry VIII, who then launched a major raid into south-west Scotland. The Scottish army that marched against them was poorly led and organised, and many Scots were either captured or drowned in the river. News of the defeat is believed to have hastened the early death of James V.

==Background==
When Henry VIII of England broke from the Roman Catholic Church, he asked James V of Scotland, his nephew, to do the same. James ignored his uncle&#x27;s request and further insulted him by refusing to meet with Henry at York. Furious, Henry VIII sent troops led by Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk against Scotland. In retaliation for the massive English raid into Scotland, James assigned Robert, Lord Maxwell, the Scottish Warden of West March, the task of raising an army.

James wrote to Pope Paul III on 9 November 1542 about the English raid, and explained that he had defied Henry&#x27;s attempts to convert him to the Protestant faith by waging war with his vast resources gained from the dissolution of the monasteries. The Earl of Angus wrote that Cardinal Beaton and the Earl of Moray had intended to follow the Scottish army into England at the East March and serve a papal interdict in English churches.

An order for the muster of Scottish forces at the Kirk of Morton (near Bogrie, in Scotland) before dawn on 22 November survives. Men from Dumfries, Peebles, Selkirk, and Hawick were summoned. The note mentions their routes; from Dumfries to Hoddom and Kirkconnel tower in Ecclefechan; from Peebles to Moffat; from Selkirk to Eskdalemuir.

==Battle==
On 24 November 1542, an army of 15,000–18,000 Scots advanced into England. Lord Maxwell, though never officially designated commander of the force, declared he would lead the attack in person. A report of George Douglas of Pittendreich, who was not present, and some later chronicle accounts, say that in the absence of Maxwell, Oliver Sinclair, James V&#x27;s favourite, declared himself to be James&#x27;s chosen commander. According to this account of the battle, the other commanders refused to accept his command and the command structure disintegrated. The English commanders, Lord Wharton and Sir William Musgrave, made reports of the battle. Musgrave stated that Maxwell was still in charge and fought with the rest of the Scottish nobles, who were forced to dismount on the bank of the River Esk.

The Scots&#x27; advance into England was met near Solway Moss by Lord Wharton and his 3,000 men. The battle was uncoordinated and may be described as a rout. Sir Thomas Wharton described the battle as the overthrow of the Scots between the rivers Esk and Lyne. The Scots, after the first encounter of a cavalry chase at &quot;Akeshawsill&quot;, now Oakshawhill, moved &quot;down&quot; towards Arthuret Howes. They found themselves penned in south of the Esk, on English territory between the river and the Moss (a peat bog), and after intense fighting surrendered themselves and their 10 field guns to the English cavalry. Wharton said the Scots were halted at the Sandy Ford by Arthuret mill dam. The Scots were &#x27;beguiled by their own guiding&#x27;, according to one Scottish writer. Several hundred of the Scots may have drowned in the marshes and river.

James, who was not present at the battle (he had remained at Lochmaben), withdrew to Falkland Palace, humiliated and ill with fever. The news that his wife had given birth to a daughter instead of a son further crushed his will to live, and he is reported to have stated that the House of Stewart &quot;came with a lass and will go with a lass&quot;. He died at Falkland two weeks later at the age of thirty. According to George Douglas, in his delirium he lamented the capture of his banner and Oliver Sinclair at Solway Moss more than his other losses.

==Aftermath==
Gervase Phillips has estimated that only about seven Englishmen and 20 Scots were killed but 1,200 Scottish prisoners were taken, including Sinclair, the Earls of Cassilis, Glencairn, and Maxwell. Prisoners taken to England included Lord Gray and Stewart of Rosyth. A number of the Scottish earls, lords, and lairds were released; they sent hostages, called &#x27;pledges&#x27;, to England in their place. On 14 December 1542, Thomas Wharton&#x27;s report of the battle was read to the Privy Council, and they ordered that Scottish prisoners entering London should wear a red St Andrew&#x27;s cross. Among the captured guns were four falconets with the cast cipher of &#x27;JRS&#x27; for &#x27;Jacobus Rex Scotorum&#x27; and the Scottish royal arms with an imperial crown.

Eustace Chapuys reported that the Scottish prisoners attended Henry&#x27;s court on Christmas Day wearing swords and dirks. They were able to talk to the French ambassador, and Henry gave them each a present of a gold chain. These hostages and prisoners were mostly well treated in England, as it was hoped that when they returned to Scotland after their ransoms had been paid, they would further the English cause. Some of the high-ranking prisoners taken at the battle were exchanged for their &#x27;pledges&#x27; at Carlisle on 10 January 1543. Chapuys said the return of some prisoners was prevented at this time by the Scottish government, which claimed they were traitors for losing the battle, or suspected they were now being influenced by Henry. As their families were arrested, these prisoners could not provide their pledges and stayed on the border at Berwick-upon-Tweed.

However, a modern historian Marcus Merriman sees the battle and hostage-taking more as the culmination of James V&#x27;s war rather than the beginning of Henry VIII&#x27;s War of Rough Wooing (also known as the Nine Years&#x27; War). He notes that the capture of so many Scottish nobles at the time of the birth and accession of Mary, Queen of Scots, did not affect Henry&#x27;s policy or the Scottish lords&#x27; subsequent rejection of the Treaty of Greenwich in December 1543.

===Schedules of prisoners, keepers, and pledges===
The chief Scottish prisoners were taken to Newcastle upon Tyne, and were listed with their English keepers at that time in a schedule prepared by Sir Thomas Wharton; below the keepers of their substitute &#x27;pledges&#x27; or hostages are added from a list compiled later in 1543 amongst the papers of the Earl of Shrewsbury.

* James Douglas of Drumlanrig; keeper, the Master Customar of Carlisle.
* John Maxwell of Cohill; keeper, William Sandes; pledge, Archibald Maxwell, his brother, a child, in Yorkshire.
* James Sinclair; keeper Alexander Musgrave; pledge, as for Oliver Sinclair.
* John Charteris; keeper, William Porter
* Robert Charteris; keeper, John Wharton 
* John Maxwell, brother of Lord Maxwell; pledge, his nephew Hugh Maxwell in Yorkshire.
* Patrick Hepburn; keeper Lionel Carnaby
* Walter Ker, laird of Graddon; keeper Thomas Denton; his pledge with Sir William Gascoigne, senior.
* George Hume, laird of Ayton; keeper Thomas Warcup
* Laird of Awncastell (John Maitland, laird of &#x27;Awik Castle&#x27;, Annan); keeper Simon Musgrave; pledge, his brother with Thomas Wentworth.
* William, Earl of Menteith; keeper Lancelot Lancaster.
* Robert Erskine, son of Lord Erskine; keeper Edward Aglionby.
* Patrick, Lord Gray; keeper Walter Strickland; pledges with the Archbishop of York.
* Laurence, Lord Oliphant: keeper Sir John Lowther; pledges with the Bishop of Durham.
* Oliver Sinclair: keeper Sir John Lowther: pledge, son of the Laird of Cleisburn
* Hugh, Lord Somerville; keeper Sir Thomas Curwen
* Malcolm, Lord Fleming; keeper Sir William Musgrave. Deceased when the Talbot-Shrewsbury papers list was compiled.
* Gilbert Kennedy, Earl of Cassilis; keeper Sir Thomas Wharton: pledge with Archbishop of Canterbury.
* Lord Maxwell; keeper Sir Thomas Wharton; remained at Carlisle in person.
* William Cuninghame, 4th Earl Glencairn, keeper Duke of Norfolk

In March 1544, as the War of Rough Wooing or Nine Years&#x27; War commenced in earnest, Henry VIII sent the Richmond Herald, Gilbert Dethick, to the Privy Council of Scotland at Stirling Castle to demand the return to England of a number of those high-ranking prisoners who had been allowed to go home on licence. These were: the Earls of Cassilis and Glencairn, Lords Somerville, Maxwell, Gray, Oliphant, and Fleming, with Oliver Sinclair, George Hume of Ayton, Robert Master of Erskine, William Seton, Patrick Hepburn, James Pringle, James Sinclair, Alexander Sinclair, John Maitland of Awencastle, Henry Maxwell brother of lord Maxwell, John Ross of Craigie, the laird of Moncrieff, John Leslie younger son of the earl of Rothes, and John Carmichael. If the council did not organise their return, Henry threatened revenge on their pledges in England, and penalties on future captives.

<doc id="385742" wikidata="Q367748" url="?curid=385742" title="The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)">
<text>The Fall of the Roman Empire is a 1964 American epic historical drama film directed by Anthony Mann and produced by Samuel Bronston, with a screenplay by Ben Barzman, Basilio Franchina and Philip Yordan. The film stars Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd, Alec Guinness, James Mason, Christopher Plummer, Mel Ferrer, and Omar Sharif.

When the filming of &quot;El Cid&quot; (1961) had finished, Anthony Mann saw a copy of Edward Gibbon&#x27;s 1776–1789 six-volume series &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; inside Hatchards bookshop. He pitched a film adaptation of the book to Samuel Bronston, who then agreed to produce the project. Philip Yordan was enlisted to write the script while Charlton Heston was initially set to star. However, Heston backed out of the film and agreed to star in &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot; (1963). Prominent actors were cast to portray multiple roles in the film. The final screenplay was written by Ben Barzman and Basilio Franchina with a prologue written by historian Will Durant. Filming began in January 1963 and wrapped in July. The film featured the largest outdoor set in the history of film at that time, a replica of the Roman Forum.

The film&#x27;s name refers not to the final fall of the Western Roman Empire, which did in fact survive for centuries after the period depicted in the film, but rather to the onset of corruption and decadence which led to Rome&#x27;s demise. It deals extensively with the problem of imperial succession, and examines both the relationship between father and son on the background of imperial politics as well as the nature and limits of loyalty and friendship.

On March 24, 1964, the film premiered at the London Astoria. Critics found the script lacking in emotion and humanity and the direction misguided, but accorded a degree of praise for the large spectacles. The film was a financial failure at the box office, earning $4.8 million on a budget of $16 million.

==Plot==
In the winter of 180 AD, the ailing Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius fights to keep Germanic tribes from invading his northern territories on the Danube frontier. His deputies are the Greek ex-slave Timonides and the stern and honest general Gaius Livius. Privately Aurelius holds egalitarian ideals, and wants a successor who will reform the empire and grant equal rights to all its subjects; this disqualifies his son Commodus, who prefers to rule by force. Instead, Aurelius decides to nominate Livius, Commodus&#x27;s closest friend and the lover of the emperor&#x27;s daughter Lucilla.

Before Aurelius can announce his plan, he is poisoned by Commodus&#x27;s crony Cleander, who with his allies hope to secure their own political future by ensuring Commodus&#x27; ascension. Feeling that a plebeian such as himself would never be accepted as emperor without Aurelius&#x27;s explicit backing, Livius lets his old friend take the position instead. Commodus is not part of the murder plot, but nonetheless hates his father for trying to deny him the throne. He dedicates himself to undoing all of Aurelius&#x27;s policies of equality, and to extracting heavy taxes from the provinces to enrich the city of Rome.

Meanwhile, Livius&#x27;s army defeats the Germans on the frontier. Among the captives are the chieftain Ballomar and his court. Timonides and Lucilla convince Livius to advocate for mercy towards the conquered barbarians, thus perpetuating the legacy of Aurelius. Timonides wins the Germans&#x27; trust by successfully undergoing an ordeal, having his hand held in the flame of a torch without crying out, and they agree to submit to the judgement of the Roman Senate. Despite hostility from Commodus, speeches by Livius and Timonides persuade the senators to let the German captives become peaceful farmers on Italian land, thereby encouraging their fellow barbarians to cooperate with Rome instead of fighting it. Thwarted, Commodus sends Livius back to the northern frontier and Lucilla to Armenia, with whose king, Sohaemus, she shares a loveless political marriage.

Lucilla joins a revolt in Rome&#x27;s eastern provinces, where a famine has been exacerbated by the new taxes. Commodus sends his northern army against the rebels, knowing that Livius will put aside personal feelings and fight to preserve the unity of the Empire. As the opposing Roman armies meet for battle, Sohaemus arrives and attacks Livius with both the Armenian army and troops borrowed from Rome&#x27;s archenemy, the Persians. The rebels patriotically decide to fight Persia instead of Rome, joining with Livius and helping him to vanquish Sohaemus. As a reward Commodus declares Livius his co-emperor, but only on condition that the northern army inflicts harsh punishments on the rebellious provinces.

Rejecting this piece of brutality, Livius and Lucilla take their army to Rome, intending to make Commodus abdicate. The emperor responds by bribing away the soldiers&#x27; loyalty and massacring Timonides and the population of the German colony. Lucilla tries to hire Verulus, Commodus&#x27;s gladiator bodyguard, to assassinate her brother; Verulus declines, confessing that he slept with Aurelius&#x27;s wife and that Commodus is his illegitimate son.

The Senate declares Commodus a god, and Livius and Lucilla are sentenced to be burned alive as human sacrifices to the new deity as the Roman citizens drunkenly celebrate. In consideration of their former friendship, Commodus offers Livius a duel for the throne. The two fight with javelins in the Roman Forum, where Livius eventually runs Commodus through. At last Livius is free to become emperor, but he has lost faith in Rome&#x27;s ability to reform. He departs the city with Lucilla, as Commodus&#x27;s old advisers fight over the throne and offer competing bribes to the army in an attempt to gain military support.

A voice-over epilogue states that though the Roman Empire did not fall immediately, internal corruption led to its eventual collapse.

==Production==
===Development===
The idea for &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; originated with Anthony Mann who had just finished directing &quot;El Cid&quot; (1961). In London, while waiting for a taxi cab, he spotted an Oxford concise edition of Edward Gibbon&#x27;s six-volume series &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; near the front window at the Hatchards bookshop. Mann then considered a film adaptation of the book as his next project after reading the book on a flight trip to Madrid. There, he pitched the idea to Samuel Bronston to which the producer agreed. In July 1961, Bronston told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; would be his next project, but he had also ruled out filming on location in Rome. He stated that upon &quot;checking I found the Eternal City was not the &#x27;city&#x27; of the time of the fall of the empire, so we&#x27;ll build our &#x27;Rome&#x27; in Madrid.&quot; Additionally, Philip Yordan had been tasked to write the script while Charlton Heston was being offered the role of Marcus Aurelius.

In September 1961, Bronston formally announced he was planning a trilogy of historical spectacles in Spain, which included &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; with Mann and Heston returning to direct and star in. Filming was initially set in February 1962, with the production design for the recreated Roman Forum supervised by Veniero Colasanti and John Moore. Months later, by December, Heston had disliked Yordan&#x27;s script for the film. At the premiere of &quot;El Cid&quot; (1961), in Madrid, Heston told Bronston associate Michael Waszynski that he was not interested in &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. On the next day, during a jet flight back to Los Angeles, Yordan, who was seated next to Heston, and director Nicholas Ray pitched &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot; (1963) to him. Subsequently, &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot; went into production while &quot;Roman Empire&quot; was placed on hold. The elaborate sets for &quot;Roman Empire&quot; were later demolished and replaced with the Forbidden City sets for &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot;.

===Writing===
In April 1963, Mann explained to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that while the film was not a direct adaptation of Gibbon&#x27;s volume series, the focus on a fifteen-year period from Marcus Aurelius&#x27;s reign to Commodus&#x27;s death was backed by historians as &quot;the turning point in the history of the empire and by concentrating our story on it we can keep the same group of characters within the range of our drama.&quot; Having selected a focal point for the film, screenwriter Basilio Franchina was hired for his broad knowledge of the period while Ben Barzman would handle the actual writing of the script. Together, they subsequently wrote a 350-page film treatment.

After this, Mann consulted with the screenwriters on further developing the characters, in which they wrote six drafts in total. The sixth draft was developed during filming. Mann later explained, &quot;The writing took us more than one year. We did not have artists in mind when we were writing; but we wanted characters with memorable scenes to attract artists of the calibre of Guinness to want to play them.&quot;

As the script was being written, the Roman Forum was constructed on Bronston&#x27;s studio backlot although their script had made no mention of it. Under Yordan&#x27;s supervision, the action was re-written for scenes they had not written for the Forum to occur there, which brought much dismay from Barzman. In January 1963, it was reported that historian Will Durant had written a prologue for the film.

===Casting===
It was envisioned that Heston was cast as Livius, but he turned it down. The part had also been offered to Kirk Douglas, who turned it down as well following an offer of $1.5 million. In 1971, he later said he regretted this &quot;because with $1.5 million there are lots of things you can do that you want to.&quot; In May 1962, it was announced that Stephen Boyd, who had played opposite to Heston in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), was cast as the lead opposite Gina Lollobrigida as Lucilla. In September 1962, it was announced that Sophia Loren had been cast as Lucilla, in which she was paid $1 million.

In August 1962, it was reported that Alec Guinness had been cast as Marcus Aurelius, while Richard Harris, Albert Finney, John Gielgud, and Terence Stamp were being considered for other roles. Later that same month, it was reported that Harris had been cast as Commodus. However, in January 1963, he was replaced by Christopher Plummer who had pulled out of &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; (1963) to do so. Harris later portrayed the role of Marcus Aurelius in the similarly themed 2000 film &quot;Gladiator&quot;. By the time filming was set to begin, Anthony Quayle, Omar Sharif, John Ireland, and Mel Ferrer had been cast in supporting roles.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on January 14, 1963. Marcus Aurelius&#x27;s winter camp on the Danube was shot on location in the snow along the Sierra de Guadarrama in northern Madrid. By the next month, filming in the area was suspended due to a severe blizzard. The battle sequence between the Romans and Persians involved 8,000 extras, and was shot on an undulating plain near Manzanares el Real, which allowed for legions of soldiers to be visible over a long distance.

Meanwhile, Yakima Canutt was hired as the second unit director at the insistence of Mann. As previously done in &quot;El Cid&quot; (1961), Canutt performed his own stunts while his son Tap served as the stunt double for Stephen Boyd. Jack Williams served as the body double for Christopher Plummer. Among the first scenes shot was the chariot race sequence between Livius and Commodus. Canutt was also tasked to gather 1,500 horses from Spain and Portugal, for which they were trained to fall safely during the battle sequences.

Interior scenes were shot in Madrid at the Samuel Bronston Studios (formerly known as the Chamartín Studios) and at the Cinecittà studios in Rome where Commodus&#x27;s baths and gymnasiums were constructed. Filming had been arranged to shoot at Cinecittà in order to make it eligible for government subsidies. In July 1963, filming was finished after 143 days. Second unit directors Canutt and Andrew Marton spent an additional 63 days shooting the action sequences.

===Production design===
Veniero Colasanti and John Moore served as the art directors overseeing the production design with the guidance of Will Durant. Actual construction began on October 1, 1962, using 1,100 men who labored for seven months. About 400 art students and craftsmen throughout Spain worked on the statuary, tiles, frescoes, and details of the set. The film&#x27;s reconstruction of the Roman Forum was constructed in Las Matas near Madrid, approximately sixteen miles from Bronston&#x27;s studio. The entire set was measured at 400 x 230 metres (1312 x 754 feet), which holds the record for the largest outdoor film set. Uniquely for the film, the set was not extended through the use of matte paintings.

The Temple of Jupiter was constructed on a high hill along the plains of Las Matas by which craftsmen built the temple on it. The bronze equestrian figures at the top of the temple were above the pavement of the forum set. For the statuary, 350 statues had to be constructed. There were 76 life-size statues, more than a thousand sculpted bases for the remaining figures and victory columns, and a series of the aforementioned equestrian statues that were high. Ultimately, more than 3,000 sketches were drawn to illustrate the 27 structures that would comprise the sets. The various ancient Rome settings covered . After much of the set was pulled down, the remaining sections were reused in &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1966).

==Music==
Dimitri Tiomkin&#x27;s score, which is one of the notable features of the film, is more than 150 minutes in length. It is scored for a large orchestra, including an important part for cathedral organ. Several cues are extended compositions in their own right. These include &quot;Pax Romana&quot; in which Marcus Aurelius summons the governors of all the Roman provinces. Although Christopher Palmer stated in his book on film music, &quot;The Composer in Hollywood&quot;, that it was a march, the cue is actually in the style of a bolero.

Other notable cues include those for &quot;The Roman Forum&quot;, composed to accompany Commodus&#x27;s triumphal return to Rome as the newly installed Emperor; a percussive scherzo for a barbarian attack by Ballomar&#x27;s army; the Tarantella danced by the Roman mob on the evening presaging the gladiatorial combat between Livius and Commodus (which seems to be modelled on the Tarantella movement from the Piano Concerto of Tiomkin&#x27;s teacher Ferruccio Busoni).

The music was recorded at the Royal Albert Hall. The music editor was George Korngold, son of Erich Wolfgang Korngold. A soundtrack album was released by Columbia Records to coincide with the release of the film.

==Release==
Prior to the film&#x27;s release, columnist Hedda Hopper predicted in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;this beautiful, honest, superbly done film will make millions.&quot; The film had its world premiere screening at the London Astoria on March 24, 1964, and ran there for 70 weeks. Two days later, the film premiered at the DeMille Theater in New York City. In April 1964 the film was screened, although out of competition, at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival. Sophia Loren was a guest, appearing at the Cannes premiere on a chariot.

The film had been shot in Ultra Panavision 70 with a 2.76:1 aspect ratio, although it was never screened in that format. Instead, it was screened with a 2.20:1 aspect ratio for 70mm roadshow presentations, and subsequently in 35mm at 2.35:1 during the film&#x27;s general release. The film&#x27;s original running time had totaled 185 minutes including an overture, intermission, and exit music. However, for the film&#x27;s general release, the film was reduced by half an hour.

===Novelization===

In conjunction with the film&#x27;s release, a paperback novelization also titled &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; was published by Fawcett Publications. The novelization was written by Harry Whittington and was based on the film&#x27;s screenplay. The cover of the novel is a screenshot from the film. The text of the novel provides a more detailed exposition of the film&#x27;s plot line. Other covers that were not screenshots of the film were used for this novel of the film.

===Home media===
The film was first released on LaserDisc in a letterboxed format during the 1990s. The most complete version of the film was released on Super 8mm in the early 1990s, extracted from a 16mm print.

On April 29, 2008, the film was released on a three-disc limited collector&#x27;s edition DVD as part of the Miriam Collection by the Weinstein Company. This edition included bonus materials including an audio commentary by Bill Bronston (son of producer Samuel Bronston) and biographer Mel Martin; a reproduction of the original 1964 souvenir program; a behind-the-scenes look at the fall of the real Roman Empire; a &quot;making of&quot; documentary; five &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; featurettes on the Roman Empire; and a set of six color production stills. The Blu-ray disc was released in the United Kingdom on May 16, 2011.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; sharply criticized the film writing, &quot;So massive and incoherent is it, so loaded with Technicolored spectacles, tableaus and military melees that have no real meaning or emotional pull, that you&#x27;re likely to have the feeling after sitting through its more than three hours (not counting time out for intermission), that the Roman Empire has fallen on you. The reason it misses is obvious — misses as entertainment, that is, not as a mass of noisy footage that leaves the senses flattened and numbed. There isn&#x27;t a character in it for whom you&#x27;re made to care two hoots —or, indeed, made to feel is important, or, for that matter, made to understand. The fellows who wrote the screenplay — Ben Barzman, Basilio Franchina and Philip Yordan—have failed completely to shape a drama that has human interest or even sense.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine criticized the production design as well noting &quot;Bronston&#x27;s Rome is patently too fabulous to have been built in a day, but it doesn&#x27;t look lived-in either. Director Anthony Mann makes it a picture-book setting aswarm with extras behaving like extras and movie stars all dressed up to face posterity in spanking new tunics, togas, and armor.&quot;

Hollis Alpert of &quot;Saturday Review&quot; wrote: &quot;Never before have script writers (there were three involved) written a screenplay like this one, in which the two main parts are complete voids. One must assume Mr. Bronston offered Mr. Boyd and Miss Loren huge sums to journey to Spain for the movie, they took time only to read the contract and not the script. Several others also appear to great disadvantage in the film, among them James Mason, Omar Sharif, Mel Ferrer, and Anthony Quayle.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer, reviewing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, felt the film was &quot;more like a recapitulation of all the great movie spectacles, historical and pseudo, than a monumental entity in itself.&quot; He further wrote &quot;Yet the only emotion it engenders is excitement — intermittent excitement, and its art lies in its parts (the camera work, the color, a few of the performances, even the music) but not in their sum. Its triumph is the triumphs of its technicians, of matter over mind.&quot; In contrast, &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film, summarizing: &quot;Large in theme and concept, colorful in treatment, &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; is Sam Bronston&#x27;s greatest coup de cinema.&quot;

Among later reviews, Mike Cummings from AllMovie gave the film a positive review, praising the film for its performances and musical score. Leonard Maltin awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing &quot;Intelligent scripting, good direction, and fine acting place this far above the usual empty-headed spectacle&quot;. Steven H. Scheuer disliked the film at first and asked his &quot;Movies on TV&quot; readers to &quot;excuse the divine Sophia Loren for looking so uncomfortable,&quot; but later reconsidered his opinion and rated it 3 out of 4 stars.

The film has a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 14 reviews, with an average of 7.20 out of 10.

===Box office===
The film grossed $4.8 million at the box office in the United States and Canada, from which it returned nearly $1.9 million in distributor rentals in the United States and Canada.

===Accolades===
==Aftermath==
Following the release of &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, Bronston was slated to release &quot;Circus World&quot; in the following June. In March 1964, it was reported that Pierre S. du Pont III took over the company, in which he had signed guarantee bonds for the films to reach completion so it would enable Bronston to raise finance. However, two months later, in June 1964, Bronston Production filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reporting over $5.6 million in debts to du Pont.

In May 1971, Bronston attempted a comeback with a planned epic about Isabella of Spain. Glenda Jackson had signed to portray the title role while John Philip Law was to play Ferdinand II, but the film was never made. In the following June, a court ordered Bronston to pay Du Pont $3 million.

During the bankruptcy proceedings, Bronston was asked, under oath, by a lawyer for one of the creditors if he had had an account in Zürich at any time while running the company. He answered that the company had had an account there for six months. While that answer was true, later research found that Bronston personally had had an account in Zürich at another time, and the lawyers referred the case to federal prosecutors who secured a perjury conviction against Bronston. He appealed, on the grounds that while he had not told the whole truth, he had not been lying about the company&#x27;s Zürich account. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the conviction, but in 1973 the United States Supreme Court agreed with Bronston, holding unanimously that &quot;literally truthful but technically misleading&quot; answers to questions under oath did not constitute perjury and instead examiners should ask further questions clarifying the matter.
