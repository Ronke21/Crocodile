<text>Fakhr al-Din Ma&#x27;n (; March or April 1635), commonly known as Fakhr al-Din II or Fakhreddine II (), was the paramount Druze emir of Mount Lebanon from the Ma&#x27;n dynasty, an Ottoman governor of Sidon-Beirut and Safed, and the strongman over much of the Levant from the 1620s to 1633. For uniting modern Lebanon&#x27;s constituent parts and communities, especially the Druze and the Maronites, under a single authority for the first time in history, he is generally regarded as the country&#x27;s founder. Although he ruled in the name of the Ottomans, he acted with considerable autonomy and developed close ties with European powers in defiance of the Ottoman imperial government.

Fakhr al-Din succeeded his father as the emir of the Chouf mountains in 1591. He was appointed over the sanjaks (districts) of Sidon-Beirut in 1593 and Safed in 1602. Despite joining the rebellion of Ali Janbulad in 1606, Fakhr al-Din remained in his post and the Ottomans recognized his takeover of the Keserwan mountains from his rival Yusuf Sayfa. Seven years later, an imperial campaign was launched against him for allying with Tuscany and garrisoning the strategic fortresses of Shaqif Arnun and Subayba. He escaped and became an exile in Tuscany and Sicily. Upon his return in 1618, he resumed control of his former domains and within three years took over northern Mount Lebanon, which was predominantly Maronite. After Fakhr al-Din routed the governor of Damascus at the Battle of Anjar in 1623, he extended his control to the Beqaa Valley, the stronghold of his rivals, the Harfush dynasty. Fakhr al-Din proceeded to capture fortresses across central Syria, gained practical control of Tripoli and its eyalet, and acquired tax farms as far north as Latakia. Although he frequently attained government favor by timely forwarding of tax revenue, bribing officials, and using opportunities of mutual interest to eliminate local rivals, his outsized power and autonomy were considered a rebellion by the imperial government. A near-contemporary historian remarked that &quot;the only thing left for him to do was to claim the Sultanate&quot;. He surrendered to the Ottomans during a siege of his Chouf hideout in 1633 and was executed in Constantinople two years later. In 1697 Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s grandnephew was awarded a tax farm spanning southern Mount Lebanon. It was gradually expanded by the Ma&#x27;ns&#x27; marital relatives, the Shihabs, in 1711, and was a precursor to the Lebanese Republic.

According to the historian Kamal Salibi, Fakhr al-Din &quot;combined military skill and eminent qualities of leadership with a keen business acumen and unusual powers of observation&quot;. During a period when the empire was in a long economic crisis, Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s territories thrived, and Sidon in particular attained political significance for the first time in its modern history. He protected, promoted, and helped modernize commercial agriculture in his domains, inaugurating the lucrative silk trade of Mount Lebanon. By opening his port towns for European commerce, he facilitated the most significant European political and economic penetration of the Levantine coast since the 13th century. Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s wealth, derived mainly from his tax farms, but also from extortion and counterfeiting, enabled him to invest in the fortifications and infrastructure needed to foster stability, order, and economic growth. His building works included palatial government houses in Sidon, Beirut and his Chouf stronghold of Deir al-Qamar, caravanserais, bathhouses, mills, and bridges, some of which remain extant. Tax farming financed his army of mercenaries, which after 1623 mostly replaced the local peasant levies on which he previously depended. Christians prospered and played key roles under his rule, with his main enduring legacy being the symbiotic relationship he set in motion between Maronites and Druze, which proved foundational for the creation of a Lebanese entity.

== Origins and early life ==


Fakhr al-Din was born , the eldest of at least two sons of Qurqumaz ibn Yunus, the other son being Yunus. They belonged to the Ma&#x27;n dynasty, a Druze family of Arab stock established in the Chouf area of southern Mount Lebanon from before the Ottoman conquest of the Levant in 1516; traditional accounts date their arrival in the Chouf to 1120. The Chouf was administratively divided into a number of (subdistricts). They were part of the Sidon Sanjak, a district of Damascus Eyalet. The Chouf, together with the neighboring mountainous of the Gharb, the Jurd and the Matn, all south or east of Beirut, were commonly referred to in contemporary sources as &quot;the Druze Mountain&quot; due to their predominantly Druze population.

Like other Ma&#x27;nids before him, Qurqumaz was a , a local rural chieftain in charge of a small area. He was also a —a holder of a limited-term tax farm known as an —over all or part of the Chouf. He was referred to as &#x27;emir&#x27; by local chroniclers, but the title reflected the traditional prominence of his family in the community and was not an official rank. Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s mother, Sitt Nasab, belonged to the Tanukh, a princely Druze family established in the Gharb from at least the 12th century. In the words of the historian Kamal Salibi, Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s paternal ancestors &quot;were the traditional chieftains of the hardy Druzes&quot; of the Chouf, and his maternal kinsmen &quot;were well acquainted with commercial enterprise&quot; in Beirut (see family tree below).

The Druze were officially considered Muslims by the Ottomans for taxation purposes, though they were not viewed as genuine Muslims by the authorities. Members of the community had to pretend to be of the Sunni Muslim creed to attain any official post, were occasionally forced to pay the poll tax known as which was reserved for Christians and Jews, and were the target of condemnatory treatises and s (religious edicts). In countering their incorporation into the Ottoman administrative and fiscal system, the Druze benefited from rugged terrain and possession of muskets, making it difficult to impose Ottoman authority in the Druze Mountain. Ottoman efforts to tax and disarm the Druze manifested in a series of punitive expeditions between 1523 and 1585. During the summer 1585 expedition, hundreds of Druze elders were slain by the vizier Ibrahim Pasha and the Bedouin chief Mansur ibn Furaykh of the Beqaa Valley, and thousands of muskets were confiscated. Qurqumaz refused to surrender and died in hiding shortly after the expedition.

The period between Qurqumaz&#x27;s death and Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s emergence in local politics is obscure. According to the historian William Harris, the chiefs of the Druze, &quot;long disobedient and fractious, again became ungovernable&quot; after Qurqumaz&#x27;s death. The 17th-century historian and Maronite patriarch Istifan al-Duwayhi, who was an associate of the Ma&#x27;n, holds that Fakhr al-Din and Yunus were afterward taken in by their maternal uncle Sayf al-Din, the Tanukhid chief of Abeih in the Gharb, for about six years.

=== Appearance and personality ===

Most contemporary descriptions of Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s appearance note his small stature. He had an olive complexion, a ruddy face, and black eyes, described as &quot;brilliant&quot; by Eugène Roger, a Nazareth-based Franciscan who served as Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s physician in 1632–1633. His practical court historian, Ahmad al-Khalidi, referred to him as , roughly translating as &#x27;one with a kind face&#x27;. The French consul in Sidon and traveler Chevalier d&#x27;Arvieux commented on his appearance:
Fakhr al-Din was of mediocre height, brown in face; he had a colored complexion, large eyes full of fire, an aquiline nose, a small mouth, white teeth, a beautiful face, a chestnut-blond beard, a very majestic air, of wit infinitely male and a harmonious voice.
According to Harris, the English traveler George Sandys, a contemporary of Fakhr al-Din, offered the &quot;best description&quot; of his personality, calling him &quot;great in courage and achievements ... subtle as a fox, and a not a little inclining to the Tyrant [Ottoman sultan]&quot;. Sandys further noted that he was &quot;never known to pray, nor ever seen in a mosque&quot; and only made major decisions after consulting his mother. Roger remarked that he had &quot;invincible courage&quot; and was &quot;learned in astrology and physiognomy&quot;.

== Rise ==
=== Governor of Sidon-Beirut and Safed ===
Around 1590 Fakhr al-Din succeeded his father as the of all or part of the Chouf. Tax records indicate that he had gained the of the Sidon and Beirut and the port of Beirut from 14 July 1589. Unlike his Ma&#x27;nid predecessors, he cooperated with the Ottomans who, though able to suppress Mount Lebanon&#x27;s local chiefs with massive force, were unable to pacify the region in the long term without local support. When the veteran general Murad Pasha was appointed beylerbey (provincial governor) of Damascus, Fakhr al-Din hosted and gave him expensive gifts upon his arrival at Sidon in September 1593. He appointed him the sanjak-bey (district governor), of Sidon-Beirut in December. While his ancestors were locally referred to as emirs, Fakhr al-Din had attained the official rank of emir or its Turkish equivalent, bey.

The Ottomans&#x27; preoccupation with the wars against Safavid Iranbetween 1578 and 1590 and again between 1603 and 1618and the war with Habsburg Austria afforded Fakhr al-Din the space to consolidate and expand his semi-autonomous power. Between 1591 and 1594 government records indicate that Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s tax farms grew to span the Chouf, Matn, Jurd, the southern Beqaa Valley, the Shaqif and Tibnin in Jabal Amil—in present-day South Lebanon—as well as the salt profits from the ports of Acre, Sidon, and Beirut. Most of his tax farms were renewed by the Ottoman imperial government between 1596 and 1598.

Coinciding interests between Fakhr al-Din and the Ottomans frequently recurred in his career through which he advanced against his local rivals. In 1594 or 1595 Murad Pasha executed Ibn Furaykh and ordered Fakhr al-Din to kill Ibn Furaykh&#x27;s son Qurqumaz. The sources attribute the measures to Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s influence over Murad Pasha, though his role was exaggerated according to the historian Abdul-Rahim Abu-Husayn. Nonetheless, the elimination of the Furaykhs, known for their exactions on the local population and harassment of the Druze, had been a mutual interest of Fakhr al-Din and the government.

Their interests coincided again in 1598 when Fakhr al-Din was commissioned by the beylerbey of Damascus, Seyyed Mehmed Pasha, to drive out Yusuf Sayfa Pasha, the beylerbey of Tripoli and local chief of Akkar, from the of Beirut and the Keserwan. Fakhr al-Din had been wary of Yusuf&#x27;s growing proximity to his domains, while Damascus, to which Beirut and the Keserwan administratively belonged, opposed Tripoli&#x27;s encroachment into its jurisdiction. Fakhr al-Din routed Yusuf&#x27;s forces at the Nahr al-Kalb river and took control of the two for a year before returning them to Yusuf in return for payment. The battle inaugurated a rivalry between Fakhr al-Din and the Sayfas, which lasted for the remainder of his career.

In July 1602, after his patron Murad Pasha became a vizier in Constantinople, Fakhr al-Din was appointed the sanjak-bey of Safed. Shortly before, he had gained the of the Acre, Tiberias and Safed . With the Druze of Sidon-Beirut and Safed under his authority, he effectively became their paramount chief. Although the Druze were often in conflict with the Ottomans, in principle the community was loyal to the ruling Sunni Muslim states, in contrast with the Shia Muslims, who formed a large component of the population of the Safed sanjak. Fakhr al-Din, his military talents proven, may have been appointed to the post to leverage his Druze power base against the Shia.

He cultivated close ties with Safed&#x27;s Sunni religious scholarly class, known as the . Among them was Khalidi, who was of the city&#x27;s Hanafis, the Islamic school of lawfavored by the Ottoman state. Foreseeing that he would benefit from Khalidi&#x27;s close ties to the Damascene authorities and ulema, Fakhr al-Din entered him into his service. Fakhr al-Din was careful to present himself as a Sunni to the Ottoman government.

=== Janbulad rebellion and aftermath ===
In 1606 Fakhr al-Din made common cause with the Kurdish rebel Ali Janbulad of Aleppo against Yusuf; the latter had been invested as commander-in-chief of the Ottoman armies in the Levant to suppress Janbulad. Fakhr al-Din, &quot;who no doubt shared Canpolad&#x27;s [Janbulad&#x27;s] thirst for greater regional autonomy&quot;, according to the historian Stefan Winter, had ignored government orders to join Yusuf&#x27;s army. Yusuf&#x27;s rout by Janbulad and his at Hama demonstrated the weakness of the government&#x27;s troops in the Levant; after the battle, Fakhr al-Din united forces with the Kurdish rebel near Hermel. According to Khalidi, Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s motive was to defend his territory from Yusuf, though Abu-Husayn maintains that he also aimed to take over Beirut and Keserwan, both held by Yusuf.

The rebel allies advanced through the Beqaa Valley toward Damascus where Yusuf was headquartered. Fakhr al-Din and Janbulad gathered the Shihabs of Wadi al-Taym, old allies of the Ma&#x27;ns, and besieged Damascus. They defeated Yusuf&#x27;s troops outside the city and sacked its suburbs for three days, demanding Yusuf&#x27;s surrender. Yusuf escaped after bribing the city&#x27;s officials, and Fakhr al-Din and Janbulad withdrew after the officials bribed them with Yusuf&#x27;s money to lift the siege. Janbulad pursued Yusuf to his redoubt at the Krak des Chevaliers castle where the latter sued for peace, but Fakhr al-Din did not join him. In the course of the fighting, Fakhr al-Din took over the Keserwan.

Murad Pasha, who had become grand vizier in 1606, moved against Janbulad in late 1607 and demanded that Fakhr al-Din join his imperial forces at Payas off the Gulf of Alexandretta. The contemporary Damascene historian al-Burini reported that Fakhr al-Din ignored the summons, waiting for the outcome of the war to decide his position. When Janbulad was defeated, Fakhr al-Din immediately dispatched three hundred men under his son Ali with considerable gifts in the form of 150,000 piasters and 150,000 piasters&#x27; worth in silk to appease Murad Pasha in Aleppo. The high amount was a testament to the Ma&#x27;ns&#x27; wealth and demonstrated why Murad Pasha was invested in their alliance, according to the historian Alessandro Ossaretti. The Grand Vizier had been petitioned by a Damascene delegation to punish Fakhr al-Din for joining Janbulad and damaging their city, but Murad Pasha left him alone, promising the Damascenes he would deal with Fakhr al-Din at a later time. The Aleppine historian al-Urdi (d. 1660) and Sandys attributed Murad Pasha&#x27;s favorable treatment of Fakhr al-Din in the aftermath of Janbulad&#x27;s defeat to Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s large bribes and their cordial ties during Murad Pasha&#x27;s governorship of Damascus.

Fakhr al-Din was kept as sanjak-bey of Safed, his son Ali was appointed to Sidon-Beirut, and their control of the Keserwan was recognized by the Ottoman imperial government. In early 1610 Fakhr al-Din was instructed by Murad Pasha to assist the new beylerbey of Tripoli, Husayn Pasha al-Jalali, with the collection of the eyalet&#x27;s taxes amid the interference of Yusuf, who had been dismissed from his post but still held practical control of Tripoli&#x27;s countryside.

== First conflict with the Ottoman imperial government ==
=== Alliance with Tuscany ===
Toward the close of the 16th century, the Medici grand dukes of Tuscany had become increasingly active in the eastern Mediterranean, pushed for a new crusade in the Holy Land, and began patronizing the Maronite Christians of Mount Lebanon. Fakhr al-Din rebuffed two Tuscan requests to meet between 1599 and 1602, while the Grand Duke Ferdinand I did not act upon his adviser&#x27;s suggestion in 1605 to communicate with Fakhr al-Din about a new crusade and trade relations with Beirut. The Tuscans focused instead on Janbulad, with whom they signed a treaty stipulating his assistance in a new crusade and special interests for the Tuscans in the Levantine ports months before Janbulad was defeated.

After Janbulad&#x27;s defeat, the Tuscans shifted focus to Fakhr al-Din, sending him an arms shipment originally bound for Janbulad. In 1608 they promised him sanctuary in Tuscany if he backed a future crusade. Fakhr al-Din and Tuscany forged a treaty that year. It stipulated military aid and support from the Maronite clergy to Fakhr al-Din against the Sayfas, who controlled predominantly Maronite northern Mount Lebanon, in return for supporting a future Tuscan conquest of Jerusalem and Damascus.

After the Tuscans&#x27; Ottoman ally, the pretender to the throne Sultan Yahya, proved incapable of mustering sufficient support within the Empire in 1609, Fakhr al-Din became Tuscany&#x27;s &quot;last hope for an ally of the region&quot;, according to Ossaretti. The Tuscans, their Papal allies, and Fakhr al-Din maintained correspondence between then and 1611. In mid-1609 Fakhr al-Din gave refuge to the Maronite patriarch Yuhanna Makhlouf upon the latter&#x27;s flight from northern Mount Lebanon. In a 1610 letter from Pope Paul V to Makhlouf, the Pope entrusted Fakhr al-Din with the protection of the Maronite community. Sandys noted in 1610 that Fakhr al-Din had reactivated the port of Tyre for clandestine exchanges and trade with the Tuscans. The following year, he dispatched a Maronite bishop to be his representative in the court of Grand Duke Cosimo II and in the Holy See.

=== Ottoman expedition of 1613 and flight ===
Fakhr al-Din lost favor in Constantinople with the death of Murad Pasha in July 1611 and the succession of Nasuh Pasha. By then, the Ottoman imperial government, freed up from the wars with Austria and Iran and the Jelali revolts in Anatolia, had turned its attention to affairs in the Levant. The authorities had become wary of Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s expanding territory, his alliance with Tuscany, his unsanctioned strengthening and garrisoning of fortresses, and his employment of outlawed . Nasuh Pasha had old grievances with Fakhr al-Din stemming from the latter&#x27;s assistance to the Damascus janissaries in their standoff with imperial troops in Aleppo when the Grand Vizier had been governor there. In 1612 Fakhr al-Din sent his chief aide, or , Mustafa with 25,000 piasters to gain the goodwill of the Grand Vizier, who may have been offended by the gesture when compared with the much larger gift presented to his predecessor by Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s son Ali in 1607. The Grand Vizier demanded Fakhr al-Din disband his , surrender the strategic fortresses of Shaqif Arnun and Subayba, and execute his ally, the chieftain of Baalbek, Yunus al-Harfush; the orders were ignored. Not long after, Fakhr al-Din repulsed an assault by the beylerbey of Damascus, Hafiz Ahmed Pasha, against Yunus al-Harfush and Ahmad Shihab.

To check Fakhr al-Din, the Ottomans appointed Farrukh Pasha to the neighboring sanjaks of Ajlun and Nablus, and drove out two of his allied Bedouin chiefs from Ajlun and the Hauran, both of whom took refuge with Fakhr al-Din. The latter avoided direct conflict with the Ottoman government by deferring the Bedouin chiefs&#x27; requests for assistance while awaiting the imperial authorities&#x27; response to a gift of money and goods he sent. Nonetheless, at the urging of his Damascene janissary ally Hajj Kiwan, Fakhr al-Din moved to restore his allies to their home regions, sending with them his son Ali at the head of 3,000 men. With help from the Sayfas, who sought to mend ties with the Ma&#x27;ns, Ali defeated Farrukh Pasha and the faction of Damascene janissaries opposed to the Ma&#x27;ns at Muzayrib on 21 May 1613. In response, Nasuh Pasha appointed Ahmed Pasha at the head of 2,000 imperial janissaries and the troops of some sixty beylerbeys and sanjak-beys to move against Fakhr al-Din.

Fakhr al-Din garrisoned Shaqif Arnun and Subayba, both containing five years&#x27; worth of provisions and ammunition, with his under the commanders Husayn Yaziji and Husayn Tawil, respectively. He sent Ali to take safety with his Bedouin allies in the desert, while sending a Sunni delegation to Damascus led by Khalidi with a peace proposal entailing large payments to the authorities. The proposal was rejected, and on 16 September, Ahmed Pasha had all the roads from Mount Lebanon into the desert blocked and the port of Sidon blockaded to prevent Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s escape by land or sea. He sent a new sanjak-bey to Safed, where Fakhr al-Din was headquartered at the time, prompting Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s flight to Sidon. He bribed the deputy admiral of the blockade to allow his escape and boarded a European ship for Livorno, Tuscany.

Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s defected to Ahmed Pasha during the campaign, and most of Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s allies and other local chiefs, namely the Shihabs, Harfushes, Turabays, Hayars, and Qansuhs, also joined the Ottomans, with the exception of his Bedouin ally, the Mafarija chief Amr ibn Jabr, who refused to surrender Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s son Ali. Abu-Husayn explains their defections as a reflection of &quot;the precariousness of the alliances made by Fakhr al-Din&quot; and the Ottomans&#x27; ability to reassert control over the Levant when they were &quot;seriously challenged&quot; there. The Sayfas used the campaign to restore their ties with the Ottoman imperial government and revive their former power. Yusuf&#x27;s son Husayn backed Ahmed Pasha&#x27;s siege of Shaqif Arnun and proceeded to burn Deir al-Qamar, the headquarters village of the Ma&#x27;ns. In the invasion of the Chouf, Ahmed Pasha and the Sayfas were helped by Druze rivals of Fakhr al-Din. The Ma&#x27;ns led by Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s brother Yunus sued for peace, sending Sitt Nasab and a delegation of thirty Druze religious notables to Ahmed Pasha with a 25,000-piaster payment to him personally and a promised payment of 300,000 piasters to the Ottoman imperial authorities. Ahmed Pasha accepted and ordered Husayn to halt the burning of Deir al-Qamar.

== Exile in Tuscany and Sicily ==
Shortly after his arrival in Livorno on 3 November, Fakhr al-Din went to Florence. His arrival surprised the Medici, who offered to escort him back to Mount Lebanon and were irked by his refusal. Later that month, Pope Paul V informed the Medici of his opposition to military aid for Fakhr al-Din to avoid provoking a naval war with the Ottomans. The Medici also sought to avoid conflict and in correspondence with Nasuh Pasha in 1614 the latter offered to pardon Fakhr al-Din in return for restricting the port of Sidon to domestic trade with the Ottoman ports of Constantinople, Alexandretta and Alexandria. Ottoman–Tuscan negotiations about Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s fate continued through 1615. After Nasuh Pasha&#x27;s death in 1614, Fakhr al-Din also began direct attempts to reconcile with the Ottoman government.

Khalidi&#x27;s chronicle omits Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s time in Tuscany, mentioning only his departure and return. A supplement attributed to Khalidi by his chronicle&#x27;s 20th-century editors provides a detailed account of Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s time in exile, based in large part on Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s narrations to Khalidi; Abu-Husayn calls its author &quot;unknown&quot;, considering Khalidi&#x27;s authorship to be &quot;doubtful&quot;. Livorno remained Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s primary residence, but during stays in Florence he was housed in the apartment of the late Pope Leo X in the Palazzo Vecchio. He signed a letter in May requesting permission to remain in Tuscany until it was safe for him to return to Mount Lebanon, after which he relocated to the Palazzo Medici where he remained until July 1615.

Afterwards, Fakhr al-Din moved to Messina in Sicily at the invitation of its viceroy, Pedro Téllez-Girón of the Spanish Habsburgs. The Spanish Habsburgs, who were the strongest advocates of a new crusade, probably held Fakhr al-Din against his will for the next two years, possibly to threaten the Ottomans, according to Olsaretti. The viceroy allowed him a reconnaissance visit to Mount Lebanon later in 1615. He was not permitted to disembark; instead, Yunus and other kinsmen and supporters greeted him on board and informed him that &quot;all of the people of the Shuf [Chouf]&quot; awaited his return. On his return to Sicily he stopped in Malta. When the viceroy moved, in succession, to Palermo and Naples, Fakhr al-Din accompanied him.

== Peak of power ==
=== Reestablishment of the Ma&#x27;nid domains ===

In June 1614 the Ottomans administratively reorganized Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s former domains to curtail Ma&#x27;nid power, combining the sanjaks of Sidon-Beirut and Safed into a separate eyalet called Sidon and appointing to it a beylerbey from Constantinople. The new appointee redistributed control of the Druze Mountain&#x27;s among pro-Ottoman Druze chiefs, restricting the Ma&#x27;ns&#x27; to the Chouf. Political circumstances in the Empire soon after shifted to the Ma&#x27;ns&#x27; favor, beginning with the replacement of the executed Nasuh Pasha in November 1614, the dissolution of the Sidon Eyalet in early 1615, and the dismissal of Ahmed Pasha in Damascus in April 1615. The Ottoman–Safavid wars resumed about the same time, siphoning Ottoman troops from the Levant to the Iranian front. The authorities appointed Ali to the governorships of Sidon-Beirut and Safed in December 1615 in return for large payments. The imperial government&#x27;s principal objective, the dismantlement of the Ma&#x27;nid-held fortresses of Shaqif Arnun and Subayba, was carried out in May 1616.

Despite their official appointments, the Ma&#x27;ns faced continued opposition from their traditional Druze rivals, who were backed by the Sayfas. The Ma&#x27;ns defeated them in four engagements in the heart of the Druze Mountain. In the course of the fighting, the Ma&#x27;ns recaptured Beirut and the Keserwan from the Sayfas. Ali granted the in his sanjak mainly to his uncle Yunus and the Ma&#x27;ns&#x27; allies from the Tanukh and Abu al-Lama families. Growing opposition to the Ma&#x27;ns by the Shias of Safed Sanjak culminated with their support for Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s former commander Yaziji&#x27;s efforts to replace Ali as sanjak-bey and their alliance with the Shia Harfushes in 1617–1618. Yaziji was killed after taking up office in Safed in June 1618, and Ali was restored to the post.

The Ottomans pardoned Fakhr al-Din and he returned to Mount Lebanon, arriving in Acre on 29 September 1618. From that point there was no further active Druze opposition to Fakhr al-Din. In Acre Fakhr al-Din held a reception for the rural chieftains across the Levant arriving to greet him, which included all those who joined the 1613 expedition against the Ma&#x27;ns. Uneasy about the growing ties between the Harfushes and the Shia chiefs of Safed, he moved to supervise the collection of taxes in the predominantly Shia Bilad Bishara area in December. This prompted the Shia notable families of Ali Saghir, Munkir, Shukr, and Daghir to take refuge with Yunus al-Harfush and evade payment. Fakhr al-Din responded by destroying their homes. In response to the flight of the Jallaqs, a Shia family from Safed city, to Afiq, he captured Afiq, killed fifteen Shia refugees there and took captive the Jallaq women. Afterward, the Shia chiefs of the sanjak agreed to return and concede to Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s rule; he subsequently released the captives. Shia levies thereafter joined his army in his later military campaigns.

=== War with the Sayfas and control of the Maronite districts ===
During his reception of the Levantine chiefs in Acre, Fakhr al-Din had berated the Sayfas for their hostility in the preceding five years. In 1618 or 1619, he moved against the Sayfas with imperial sanction under the guise of assisting Tripoli&#x27;s beylerbey Umar Kittanji Pasha with the collection of taxes in his eyalet, which continued to be controlled by the Sayfas. On 4 February 1619 he captured and looted their stronghold of Hisn Akkar and four days later besieged Yusuf and the latter&#x27;s Druze allies in the Krak des Chevaliers.

During the siege, word had reached Fakhr al-Din that the Ottoman imperial government, probably seeking to avoid a total victory by the Ma&#x27;ns, reappointed Yusuf to the governorship of Tripoli. Fakhr al-Din pressed on with the siege and demanded a payment of 150,000 piasters from the Sayfas, while he sent a detachment to burn the Sayfas&#x27; home village of Akkar and gained the defection of the Sayfas&#x27; men in the forts of Byblos and Smar Jbeil. The beylerbeys of Damascus and Aleppo mobilized their troops in Homs and Hama, respectively, in support of Yusuf, who afterward persuaded Fakhr al-Din to accept a promissory payment of 50,000 piasters and lift the siege in March. Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s control of the Byblos and Batroun and his earlier leasing of their from Umar Kittanji was recognized by Yusuf in May in lieu of the promised payment.

Fakhr al-Din was charged by the imperial authorities with collecting tax arrears from Yusuf in June/July 1621, thereby giving him imperial cover to assault the Sayfas once again. He captured the Bahsas fort on Tripoli&#x27;s southern outskirts and besieged the Citadel of Tripoli. Under pressure, Yusuf agreed to sell Fakhr al-Din his properties in Ghazir and Antelias, both in the Keserwan, and Beirut, in return for cancelling Yusuf&#x27;s personal debts to him. The siege was maintained pending Yusuf&#x27;s payment of the tax arrears to the government, until Yusuf persuaded the authorities that Fakhr al-Din was using his imperial commission to annex Tripoli. Upon the imperial government&#x27;s orders, Fakhr al-Din withdrew from Tripoli on 2 October 1621. Yusuf was dismissed again in October/November 1622 after failing to remit the promised tax payments, but refused to hand over power to his replacement Umar Kittanji, who in turn requested Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s military support. Fakhr al-Din complied in return for the of the Tripoli of Dinniyeh, Bsharri and Akkar. Once Fakhr al-Din set out from Ghazir, Yusuf abandoned Tripoli for Akkar.

Fakhr al-Din thereafter sent his Maronite ally Abu Safi Khazen, the brother of his fiscal and political adviser and scribe, or , Abu Nadir Khazen, to occupy Maronite-populated Bsharri, thereby ending the rule of the local Maronite established since the late 14th century. The dismissed and his son were soon after executed by Fakhr al-Din in connection to the son&#x27;s raid of a Maronite monastery near Hasroun. The Maronites of Bsharri are likely to have welcomed the end of the , the last several of whom failed to protect the interests of their church and community.

Fakhr al-Din secured the defection of Yusuf&#x27;s son Beylik and their combined forces reentered Tripoli on 13 March 1623. An imperial order arrived a few days later reappointing Yusuf to the eyalet. Umar Kittanji attempted to resist his dismissal, but Fakhr al-Din, by then in practical control of most of the eyalet, insisted that the imperial government&#x27;s orders be followed. He subsequently escorted the outgoing beylerbey to Beirut and ordered Beylik to return to his father. In May/June, Fakhr al-Din mobilized his forces in Bsharri in support of Yusuf&#x27;s rebellious nephew Sulayman, who controlled Safita. Yusuf had moved against Sulayman, but relented after Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s attempted intervention, thereby confirming the Ma&#x27;ns as the practical overlords of Safita. Meanwhile, Beylik, who had been appointed by his father to govern Akkar, expelled Yusuf&#x27;s from the and declared support for Fakhr al-Din.

=== Battle of Anjar and aftermath ===

In 1623, Yunus al-Harfush prohibited the Druze of the Chouf from cultivating their lands in the southern Beqaa, angering Fakhr al-Din. In August/September 1623 he stationed in the southern Beqaa village of Qabb Ilyas and evicted the Harfushes. Meanwhile, in June or July, the imperial authorities had replaced Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s son Ali as sanjak-bey of Safed and replaced his other son Husayn and Mustafa Kethuda as the sanjak-beys of Ajlun and Nablus respectively with local opponents of Fakhr al-Din. The imperial authorities soon after restored the Ma&#x27;ns to Ajlun and Nablus, but not to Safed. The Ma&#x27;ns thereupon moved to assume control of Ajlun and Nablus, prompting Yunus al-Harfush to call on the janissary leader Kurd Hamza, who wielded significant influence over the beylerbey of Damascus, Mustafa Pasha, to block their advance. Kurd Hamza then secured Yunus al-Harfush&#x27;s appointment to Safed, followed by a failed attempt by Fakhr al-Din to outbid him for the governorship.

Fakhr al-Din launched a campaign against the Turabays and Farrukhs in northern Palestine, but was defeated in a battle at the Awja River near Ramla. On his way back to Mount Lebanon from the abortive Palestine campaign, Fakhr al-Din was notified that the imperial government had reappointed his sons and allies to Safed, Ajlun, and Nablus. The reversal was linked to the successions of Sultan Murad IV () and Grand Vizier Kemankeş Ali Pasha, the latter of whom had been bribed by Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s agent in Constantinople to restore the Ma&#x27;ns to their former sanjaks. Mustafa Pasha and Kurd Hamza, nonetheless, proceeded to launch an expedition against the Ma&#x27;ns. Fakhr al-Din arrived in Qabb Ilyas on 22 October, and immediately moved to restore lost money and provisions from the Palestine campaign by raiding the nearby villages of Karak Nuh and Sar&#x27;in, both held by the Harfushes.

Afterward, the Damascenes, the Harfushes, and the Sayfas set out from Damascus, while Fakhr al-Din mobilized his Druze fighters, , and Shia levies. He sent the Shihabs to serve as his vanguard in the tower of Anjar, but by the time Fakhr al-Din arrived there in early November 1623, the Shihabs had been driven off and the Sayfas and Harfushes had taken over the tower. Fakhr al-Din immediately routed the Damascene janissaries at Anjar and captured Mustafa Pasha, while Kurd Hamza and Yunus al-Harfush escaped to Aleppo. Fakhr al-Din extracted from the beylerbey confirmation of the Ma&#x27;ns&#x27; governorships, his appointment over Gaza Sanjak, his son Mansur over Lajjun Sanjak, and Ali over the southern Beqaa . The appointments to Gaza, Nablus and Lajjun were not implemented due to the opposition of local powerholders.

Fakhr al-Din plundered Baalbek soon after Anjar and captured and destroyed its citadel on 28 March, after a months-long siege. The Aleppine historian Utayfi observed in 1634 that &quot;the city of Baalbek ... was in ruins ... destroyed by Fakhr al-Din Ibn Ma&#x27;n in his war with Banu al-Harfush&quot;. Yunus al-Harfush was imprisoned by the beylerbey of Aleppo and executed in 1625, the same year that Fakhr al-Din gained the governorship of the Baalbek , according to Duwayhi. The imperial government had replaced Mustafa Pasha in January 1624, but without Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s agreement, the new beylerbey could not assume office in Damascus. Mustafa Pasha remained in place and Fakhr al-Din secured from him the governorship of the Zabadani for his Shihab proxy Qasim ibn Ali. By March, Fakhr al-Din turned against Mustafa Pasha in favor of his replacement, but the new beylerbey died soon afterward, and Mustafa Pasha was reinstated in April. Relations between Fakhr al-Din and Mustafa Pasha subsequently soured.

=== Takeover of Tripoli and zenith ===
Information about the career of Fakhr al-Din after 1624 is limited due to the deaths of his main contemporary chroniclers and the increasing silence of known Ottoman government sources. Most information about his post-1624 years are provided by Duwayhi. The claim by the local 19th-century chroniclers Haydar al-Shihabi and Tannus al-Shidyaq that Murad IV, powerless against Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; control over large parts of the Levant, recognized him as (&#x27;ruler of the Land [of the Levant]&#x27;) in 1624, is a fabrication, according to Abu-Husayn.

In 1624, Fakhr al-Din lent his backing to Umar Kittanji after the latter was denied entry into Tripoli by Yusuf, who resisted Umar Kittanji&#x27;s reappointment to the eyalet that year. After mobilizing in support of Umar Kittanji in Batroun in April, Fakhr al-Din stalled from further military action while negotiating with Yusuf over fiscal concessions. Fakhr al-Din secured another four-year over Byblos, Batroun and Bsharri. Yusuf was restored as beylerbey in August, but his practical control was limited to Tripoli city, the Krak des Chevaliers, the Koura , and the Jableh sanjak, while most of the remaining areas, including Homs, were held by Fakhr al-Din or his allies and sons-in-law among Yusuf&#x27;s sons and nephews.

A few months after Yusuf&#x27;s death in July 1625, Fakhr al-Din launched an abortive assault against Tripoli. He cooperated with its new beylerbey, Mustafa Pasha ibn Iskandar, in the latter&#x27;s offensive against the Sayfas in the eyalet. He forced out his old ally Sulayman Sayfa from the Safita fortress and was later ceded the fortresses of Krak des Chevaliers and Marqab by Yusuf&#x27;s sons. In return, Fakhr al-Din influenced the beylerbey to leave the Sayfas undisturbed. In September 1626, he captured the fortress of Salamiyah, followed by Hama and Homs, appointing his deputies to govern them.

Following the appointments of two more beylerbeys to the eyalet, Fakhr al-Din was appointed beylerbey of Tripoli in 1627, according solely to Duwayhi. The near-contemporary Aleppine historian Ramadan al-Utayfi noted that Fakhr al-Din controlled Tripoli until his downfall, but does not specify whether he held office. Ottoman government records affirm that he held the of the Tripoli of Arqa, Akkar, Dinniyeh, Safita, Krak des Chevaliers, Byblos, Batroun, in addition to the of Sidon-Beirut, Safed and Baalbek, for most of 1625–1630. His were expanded to Jableh and Latakia in 1628–1629. By the early 1630s, Muhibbi noted that Fakhr al-Din had captured many places around Damascus, controlled thirty fortresses, commanded a large army of , and that the &quot;only thing left for him to do was to claim the Sultanate&quot;.

== Fall and execution ==
In 1630 or 1631, Fakhr al-Din denied the attempted winter housing of imperial troops returning from a failed campaign against the Safavids in territory under his control. The early 18th-century Ottoman historian Mustafa Naima held that Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s growing army and power by this point induced fear among the Ottomans that he would take over Damascus. Murad IV was alarmed at his growing presence in northern Syria, near the Empire&#x27;s Anatolian heartland. Numerous complaints about Fakhr al-Din were submitted to the Sultan. The Ottomans&#x27; victories against the Safavids in 1629 are likely to have freed up their forces to deal with Fakhr al-Din and other rebels across the Empire.

The imperial authorities appointed the veteran general Kuchuk Ahmed Pasha to the governorship of Damascus and promoted him to the high rank of vizier in 1632 for the purpose of eliminating Fakhr al-Din. Kuchuk led a large army toward Mount Lebanon, defeating the Ma&#x27;ns led by Ali, who was slain, near Khan Hasbaya in Wadi al-Taym. Fakhr al-Din and his retinue subsequently took refuge in a cave in Niha in the southern Chouf or further south in Jezzine. Unable to access the cave, Kuchuk started fires around it to smoke out Fakhr al-Din. He and his men consequently surrendered to Kuchuk. His sons Mansur and Husayn, the latter of whom was stationed in Marqab, had already been captured by Kuchuk. His sons Hasan, Haydar, and Bulak, his brother Yunus and nephew Hamdan ibn Yunus were all executed by Kuchuk during the expedition.

Kuchuk confiscated the money and goods in Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s possession. A 1634 document from the Sharia Court in Damascus, which recorded the confiscation and disposal of his estate, referred to Fakhr al-Din as &quot;a man well known for having rebelled against the sublime Sultanate&quot;. Kuchuk escorted him, chained on a horse, through Damascus where the local poets sang Kuchuk&#x27;s praises for toppling Fakhr al-Din. Afterward, Fakhr al-Din was sent to Constantinople. There, he was imprisoned in Yedikule, while his two sons were sent to the Galatasaray.

In March or April 1635, Fakhr al-Din was beheaded and Mansur was strangled and tossed into the sea on the orders of Murad IV. Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s body was displayed in the Hippodrome. The executions may have been prompted by complaints against the Ma&#x27;ns, particularly the operations of Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s nephew Mulhim ibn Yunus against Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s government-appointed replacement in the Chouf, Ali Alam al-Din. After his execution, his wives, all of whom were imprisoned in the Citadel of Damascus, were hanged. His maternal kinsmen, the Tanukh, were all killed by Alam al-Din. Husayn, still a youth, was spared execution and went on to have a career as a high-ranking imperial official and diplomat.

In the assessment of Olsaretti, &quot;more profound causes than a string of military events were responsible for Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s fall&quot;. Among the contributing factors were the unstable relations between Constantinople and the Levantine provinces with every change of sultan and grand vizier; Fakhr al-Din permanently fell out of imperial favor with Murad IV&#x27;s accession in 1623. Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s victories over his local rivals, such as the Sayfas and Mustafa Pasha, removed any serious checks on his power by local forces, eventually provoking an imperial backlash. His increased dependence on mercenaries in the late 1620s allowed and financially necessitated him to raise more revenue from the local population, risking their goodwill towards him. Duwayhi noted that in 1631 Fakhr al-Din sold large quantities of grain to foreign merchants during a period of scarcity, which increased food prices and burdened the inhabitants of his territories. Moreover, social and political conditions in general began to favor stronger, centralized states at the expense of local actors, such as the Ma&#x27;nid emirate.

== Politics ==
=== Economic policies ===
Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s basic governing policy was based on the collection of sufficient revenue to satisfy the exorbitant demands of the Ottoman imperial government and to elicit the goodwill of the pashas of Damascus through bribes. To raise revenue, he introduced more productive agricultural methods to his territories and promoted commerce. Sandys, who visited Sidon in 1611, observed that Fakhr al-Din had amassed a fortune &quot;gathered by wiles and extortion&quot; from locals and foreign merchants, counterfeited Dutch coins, and was a &quot;severe justice&quot;, who restored the ruined structures and repopulated the once-abandoned settlements in his domains. The tax farms which Fakhr al-Din and his family held practically undisturbed from the 1590s were the principal source of his income. The price the Ma&#x27;ns paid the imperial authorities for the tax farms remained fixed despite their increasing value, enabling Fakhr al-Din to keep the greater part of their revenue.

Fakhr al-Din protected commercial agriculture in his tax farms and encouraged the growing of cash crops, which were purchased by foreign merchants at a relatively high cost. Special attention was paid to silk production due to high demand in Europe. The Levantine raw silk market had developed in the mid-16th century due to fluctuations in the Iranian silk supply. Mount Lebanon became a center of production by 1550 and its silk exports became an important commodity in Venetian trade by the 1570s. Once in control of Tripoli Eyalet in 1627, Fakhr al-Din planted 12,000 or 14,000 mulberry trees in Tripoli&#x27;s outskirts and another large mulberry grove in nearby Hisah. As part of his efforts to foster the export of silk, he sent a gift of silk to Tuscany, which reciprocated the following year by sending him five vessels of goods. Significant profits were also derived from cotton, grain, olive oil, and wine. In Safed, where political and economic conditions in the sanjak had deteriorated in the years preceding Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s appointment, the imperial authorities lauded him in 1605 for &quot;guarding the country, keeping the Bedouins in check, ensuring the welfare and tranquility of the population, promoting agriculture, and increasing prosperity&quot;, a state of affairs affirmed by Khalidi.

The Ottoman naval defeat by a Spanish–Venetian coalition at Lepanto in 1571 had increased European economic and political influence in the eastern Mediterranean, including a revival of European–Levantine trade. Towards the end of the 16th century and during the early 17th century, the Ottoman Empire experienced a long-term economic crisis characterized by high inflation, heavy taxation, and political instability. Fakhr al-Din turned the changing economic circumstances to his advantage by opening the ports of Sidon, Beirut and Acre to European trade ships, building hostel-warehouses—known as khans—for merchants there, and establishing friendly ties with European powers. In contrast to the extortion of foreign merchants by the Assafs and Sayfas, the contemporary Arabic, Venetian, and Tuscan sources all emphasized the close relations between Fakhr al-Din, the French, English, Dutch, and Tuscan merchants and the English and French consuls in Sidon.

Fakhr al-Din used a local merchant as his representative in negotiations with foreign traders. In 1622, he secured the release of French traders captured by Moroccan pirates in Acre and assisted the completion of their activities in the town. In 1625, before Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s capture of Tripoli, the governor of Aleppo had that city&#x27;s fortifications dismantled to sway foreign merchants there to operate in Aleppine ports; instead, the mostly French and Flemish traders relocated to Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s Sidon. Under his watch, Sidon was poised to continue prospering at the expense of Aleppo and its Mediterranean ports. In 1630, the Medici granted Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s request to post a permanent representative to Sidon by dispatching an unofficial consul who operated under the French flag to avoid violating Ottoman capitulation agreements. In the assessment of Salibi, at a time when the Empire &quot;was sinking to destitution because of its failure to adapt to changing circumstances, the realm of Faḫr al-dīn Maʿn [sic], in the southern Lebanon [range] and Galilee, attracted attention as a tiny corner into which the silver of Europe flowed&quot;.

=== Fortifications and troops ===

Fakhr al-Din spent the surpluses from his mainly on fortifications and other infrastructure, which promoted the order and stability required for agriculture and trade to thrive. He obtained and strengthened fortresses throughout his early career, starting with the Chouf redoubt of Niha in 1590, followed in 1594 by fortifications in Beirut, Sidon&#x27;s inland fort, and the fort guarding Sidon&#x27;s port. After his appointment to Safed, he obtained Shaqif Arnun in Jabal Amil, formerly held by the Shia Sa&#x27;b family and which he heavily provisioned and garrisoned, and Subayba in Mount Hermon. Sandys noted that Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s &quot;invincible forts&quot; were equipped for a lengthy war. After returning from exile in 1618, he strengthened the fortifications of Acre. The coastal forts of Sidon, Beirut, and Acre were &quot;remarkable for both their strength and the fact they incorporated storage for merchandise&quot;, according to Olsaretti. He built watchtowers to guard the mulberry groves he planted in and around Tripoli.

Fakhr al-Din kept the costs of his private army relatively low during his early career as he relied mainly on local peasant levies. Although generally less skilled than professional soldiers, their permanent presence made them readily available in times of war. European government estimates of his local forces between 1605 and 1614 ranged from 10,000 to 30,000, while Sandys estimated the number to be 40,000 Muslims and Christians. Local levies constituted the bulk of the Ma&#x27;nid army until the Battle of Anjar in 1623. The peasants&#x27; principal responsibility was agriculture, which limited the amount of time and the distance in which the Ma&#x27;ns could deploy them during campaigns. As their territories and agricultural production grew, the Ma&#x27;ns&#x27; use of peasant armies decreased. Khalidi noted that in 1617 the Ma&#x27;ns were not able to mobilize more than a small number of troops because the bulk of the levies were needed to work the mulberry groves.

According to Khalidi and a Tuscan agent sent to Sidon, in 1614 Fakhr al-Din employed 1,500 professional infantry and 150 mounted musketeers, who accounted for his largest single expense. The were a mobile force used in small-scale engagements, sieges, patrols over key roads, and against pirates and brigands. From the 1620s onward, Fakhr al-Din relied on increasing numbers of . He compensated for the higher cost of their employment by taking larger shares of the surplus from his at the expense of the peasantry.

== Assessment ==
Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s political ambitions spanned well beyond the Druze Mountain and he attached equal importance to controlling the sanjaks and eyalets of Sidon-Beirut, Safed, Tripoli, and Ajlun. Harris places Fakhr al-Din, along with the heads of the Janbulad, Assaf, Sayfa, and Turabay families, in a category of late 16th–early 17th-century Levantine &quot;super chiefs ... serviceable for the Ottoman pursuit of &#x27;divide and rule&#x27; ... They could war among themselves and even with the governor of Damascus ... but were in deep trouble if the Ottomans became agitated about revenue or loyalty&quot;. In the assessment of the historian Adnan Bakhit, Fakhr al-Din was a Syrian strongman who was afforded space by the Ottomans to suppress and eliminate other local strongmen until he was destroyed by the Ottomans to facilitate their centralized rule over the Syrian eyalets. The Sunni Muslim establishment in Ottoman Damascus generally considered Fakhr al-Din as a tyrant, rebel, and infidel.

Salibi held that in the &quot;annals of Ottoman Syria&quot; Fakhr al-Din &quot;stands out as a brilliant figure by any standard&quot;. In his assessment, Fakhr al-Din &quot;was a born adventurer who combined military skill and eminent qualities of leadership with a keen business acumen and unusual powers of observation&quot;. The 17th-century English academic and clergyman Henry Maundrell remarked that Fakhr al-Din was &quot;a man much above the ordinary level of a Turkish [Ottoman] genius&quot;.

Salibi further noted that although Fakhr al-Din was &quot;a rapacious tyrant who weighed his subjects down with taxes&quot;, he was &quot;enlightened enough to realize that the better the condition of a people, the more they can pay&quot;. Sidon, Beirut, Acre and their mountainous countryside prospered under Fakhr al-Din. He helped modernize agriculture in his territories with Italian expertise and was the first to promote silk as a cash crop in Mount Lebanon at a time of global demand. Through his ties with the French, the Tuscans and the Papacy, he fostered the most significant European political and economic penetration of Sidon and Beirut since the collapse of the Crusader states in the late 13th century.

Under his stewardship, the city of Sidon attained political significance for the first time in its modern history. The Lebanese nationalist and Arab nationalist histories of Sidon written in the 1960s by Munir al-Khuri and Abd al-Aziz Salim, respectively, both commend Fakhr al-Din and note his rule was a golden age for the city.

== Legacy ==
After Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s downfall, the Ottomans attempted, unsuccessfully, to undo the unity of the Druze-dominated Chouf and the Maronite-dominated Keserwan forged under Fakhr al-Din. In 1660, the Ottomans reestablished the Sidon Eyalet and in 1697, awarded Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s grandnephew Ahmad ibn Mulhim the of its mountain of the Chouf, Gharb, Jurd, Matn, and Keserwan. The singular rule over the mountain by Ahmad and his successors from the Shihab clan inaugurated what became known to later historians as the &quot;Lebanese emirate&quot;, a term that was not used until the days of the Shihab ruler Bashir II (). Nonetheless, the system of fiscal cantons in Mount Lebanon introduced by the Shihabs in 1711 was the precursor to the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate established in 1861, which in turn, was a precursor of the modern Lebanese Republic.

Although he did not actually establish a Lebanese state, Fakhr al-Din is regarded by the Lebanese people as the founder of their modern country because he united the Druze and Maronite districts of Mount Lebanon, the neighboring Mediterranean coastal cities, and the Beqaa Valley under a single authority for the first time in history. According to Salibi, Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s only &quot;enduring&quot; political legacy was the tenuous, symbiotic union of the Maronites and the Druze, which became a significant development throughout Mount Lebanon&#x27;s later history. In the view of Harris, Fakhr al-Din inaugurated the continued interaction among the Druze, Maronite, Shia, and Sunni communal elites of the constituent regions of modern Lebanon, namely Mount Lebanon, Jabal Amil, the Beqaa Valley and the coast. From the establishment of the French Mandatory state of Greater Lebanon in 1920, Lebanese schoolchildren have been taught that Fakhr al-Din was the country&#x27;s historical founder.

Under Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s leadership, Maronite, Greek Orthodox, and Greek Catholic Christians began migrating to the Druze Mountain in large numbers; the devastation wrought on the Druze peasantry during the punitive government campaigns of the 16th century had probably caused a deficit of Druze farm labor for the Druze landowners, which was partly filled by the Christian migrants. Christians were settled in Druze villages by the Druze tribal chiefs in the days of Fakhr al-Din to stimulate agricultural production, centered on silk, and the chiefs donated land to the Maronite Church and monastic institutions to further facilitate Christian settlement. Fakhr al-Din made the first such donation in 1609. Although the Druze chiefs owned much of the Chouf lands on which the silk crop was grown, Christians dominated every other aspect of the silk economy there, including production, financing, brokerage to the markets of Sidon and Beirut, and its export to Europe. Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s religious tolerance endeared him to the Christians living under his rule. According to Duwayhi, Under Emir Fakhr al-Din the Christians could raise their heads high. They built churches, rode horses with saddles, wore turbans of fine muslin and belts with precious inlays, and carried jeweled rifles. Missionaries from Europe came and established themselves in Mount Lebanon. This was because his troops were Christians, and his stewards and attendants Maronites.

=== Nationalist historiography ===
Modern Lebanese historians from the country&#x27;s different religious communities have interpreted Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s emirate, or collection of tax farms, according to their own community&#x27;s conception of the Lebanese state, generally omitting divergent views. Nationalist narratives by Lebanese Druze and Maronites agree on Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s &quot;decisive influence and contribution to Lebanon&#x27;s history&quot;, according to the historian Yusri Hazran, though they differ significantly in determining Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s motives and the historic significance of his rule. Druze authors describe him as the ideal ruler who strove to achieve strong domestic unity, build a prosperous economy, and free Lebanon politically from Ottoman oppression. Making the case that the Ma&#x27;nids worked toward Lebanon&#x27;s integration into the Arab regional environment, the Druze authors generally de-emphasize his relations with Europe and portray his drive for autonomy as the first forerunning of the Arab nationalist movement. On the other hand, Maronite authors viewed the legacy of Fakhr al-Din as one of isolation from the Arab–Islamic milieu. Fakhr al-Din himself has been adopted by a number of Maronite nationalists as a member of the religious group, citing the refuge he may have taken with the Khazen family in the Keserwan during his adolescence, or claiming that he had embraced Christianity at his deathbed.

In the view of the historian Philip Hitti, Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s &quot;long career stood between Lebanon past and Lebanon future. It pointed to the Lebanese their destiny and established a clear-cut break between their country and Syria.&quot; According to the historian Christopher Stone, Fakhr al-Din was utilized by the Rahbani brothers in their Lebanese nationalist play, &quot;The Days of Fakhr al-Din&quot;, as &quot;a perfect historical predecessor for Lebanon&#x27;s Christian nationalism of the twentieth century&quot;.

=== Building works ===
Toward the end of his career Fakhr al-Din requested assistance from the Medici in building modern fortifications in his territory. Tuscan experts, including the architect Francesco Cioli and the builder Francesco Fagni, arrived in Sidon in 1631. D&#x27;Arvieux noted that Fakhr al-Din had a significant interest in the arts, poetry, and music. Nonetheless, the modern historian Elie Haddad holds that his communications with Tuscany indicate that Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s primary concern was utilitarian, namely the defense of his territory, facilitation of movement for his soldiers, and raising the living standards of the inhabitants.

Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s palace in Beirut, possibly built by Cioli, combined Arabic and Tuscan architectural influences, and contained a marble fountain and extensive gardens. It was no longer extant by the end of the 19th century. Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s palace in Deir al-Qamar was built in the Mamluk architectural style with little ornamentation, except its arched doorway entrance with its alternating yellow and white bands of limestone, a style known as .

Haddad assumes that Fagni oversaw the construction of water works and bridges at Nahr al-Kalb, Sidon, and Beirut, as well as the palace in Deir al-Qamar. Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s building works in Sidon, Acre, and Deir al-Qamar &quot;stand as a permanent tribute to the power and wealth that the Ma&#x27;ns achieved under his [Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s] leadership and to their role in the re-emergence of the Levantine coast&quot;, according to Olsaretti.

==== Sidon ====
Fakhr al-Din had his government house—known as a —built in Sidon as early as 1598. It consisted of a large courtyard, an iwan on the ground floor, several rooms, including roofed reception areas known as , a fountain, and gardens. It was positioned immediately south of a large square in the city, today called &#x27;Saray Square&#x27; after Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s construction. Other than the entrance of the building, which is characterized by masonry and a type of ornamented vaulting known as , the rest of the original structure had been gradually replaced through the early 19th century, when it was converted into a school; the courtyard is now a schoolyard and the garden is a playground. In its original form it was the tallest structure in Sidon and its garden had a wide variety of plants.

The expansion of commercial activity and increasing wealth in Sidon overseen by Fakhr al-Din is architecturally testified by his construction of the khans and mosques he built in the city. Fakhr al-Din is commonly, though erroneously, credited with the construction of the Khan al-Franj caravansary complex. It housed the French consul around 1616 until the consul relocated to a neighboring, formerly Ma&#x27;nid-owned property, the Dar al-Musilmani, in the 1630s. The Dar al-Musilmani was built by Fakhr al-Din, who may have used it as his original residence in the city and that of his wives. Following the capture of Fakhr al-Din by Kuchuk, the latter confiscated all of the Ma&#x27;ns&#x27; properties in Sidon, Tyre, Banias, and other places. He initially endowed the family&#x27;s properties in Sidon, sixty-nine in total and mostly owned by Fakhr al-Din, his son Ali, and brother Yunus, in an endowment—known as a waqf—administered from Damascus for the benefit of the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Among the properties were dozens of houses and shops, two khans, several mills, a soap factory, a coffeehouse, and a bathhouse (or hammam).

Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s two khans in Sidon were the Khan al-Ruzz (the Caravansary of Rice) and the Khan al-Qaysariyya, both built directly on the Mediterranean shore of the old city. The first was observed by d&#x27;Arvieux as having large stores for the storage of rice and other commodities on the ground floor, a covered gallery for the rooms housing visitors on the top floor, a large courtyard, and a small mosque. Today, the Khan al-Ruzz is in a poor state, with the lower floor used for small workshops and the upper floor permanently housing Sidonian and Palestinian families, while the mosque has been replaced by a different structure. The smaller, neighboring Khan al-Qaysariyya, which abutted the Bahri Mosque, had a small, square courtyard with four stores, a second floor with a covered gallery leading to twelve rooms for visitors. D&#x27;Arvieux considered it the most beautiful of three khans of Sidon, including the Khan al-Franj. It is a sandstone structure and at present the courtyard has been built on, the lodging rooms and half of the stores have been subdivided and their structure changed. Two of the larger original stores of the Khan al-Qaysariyya remain intact and are used as shops. Fakhr al-Din built dozens of shops in the markets of Suq al-Ars and Suq al-Harir, around the three khans. A number of them continue to function in the Saray Square.

== Marriages and children ==
Fakhr al-Din married at least four women. The sources generally omit their names, identifying them instead by their male relatives. His first wife was the sister of Muhammad ibn Jamal al-Din, a chief of the Arslans of Choueifat in the Gharb. The marriage was arranged by Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s mother and uncle Sayf al-Din to reconcile tensions with the Yamani Druze faction of which the Arslans were part. She was known in the sources by the honorific term &#x27;Sultana&#x27;, as Sitt Nasab was also known. She gave birth to Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s eldest son Ali. His second marriage was to a woman from the Qaysi Druze faction, to which the Ma&#x27;ns belonged, and nothing further is known about her.

In a series of peace settlements with the Sayfas, Fakhr al-Din established marital ties with the family. In 1613, he wed Alwa, a daughter of Yusuf&#x27;s brother Ali Sayfa, who gave birth to his sons Husayn and Hasan in 1621 and 1624, respectively, and a daughter, Sitt al-Nasr. Sitt al-Nasr was married to Yusuf&#x27;s son Hasan before 1618, and when Hasan died in 1623 she was remarried to his brother Umar in January 1624. Another of Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s daughters was wed to Yusuf&#x27;s son Beylik in 1620, while Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s son Ali was wed to Yusuf&#x27;s daughter in the same year. In 1617, one of Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s daughters was officially wed to Ahmad, a son of Yunus al-Harfush who negotiated with the Ottomans on behalf of the Ma&#x27;ns to reinstate them as the sanjak-beys of Sidon-Beirut and Safad in 1615; the daughter was not sent to join Ahmad until December 1620. After Ahmad&#x27;s death, she was married to his brother Husayn.

Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s fourth wife was Khasikiyya bint Zafir, the sister of Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s friend Ali al-Zafiri, who controlled Sidon before Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s governorship. Known for her intelligence and beauty, she became his favorite wife. She continued to live in Sidon where Fakhr al-Din renovated a palace for her. She was the mother of his sons Haydar and Bulak, and daughter Fakhira. While Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s other wives were sent for safety in Shaqif Arnun and Subayba, Khasikiyya accompanied him during his exile. She maintained social relations with the women of the Medici household, as indicated by a letter she sent to the Tuscan grand duchess Maria Maddalena in March 1616. Fakhr al-Din also had a concubine, who bore him his son Mansur.

<text>The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is a United States government agency which explores complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). It was created in 1991 as the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), and renamed the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) before receiving its current name in 2014. NCCIH is one of the 27 institutes and centers that make up the National Institutes of Health (NIH) within the United States Department of Health and Human Services.

NCCIH has been criticized for funding and marketing pseudoscientific medicine.

== Organization and history ==

===Overview===

The Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) was established in October 1991 by the United States Congress. The OAM was expanded from an office into a center and renamed the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) in October 1998. It is one of several centers within the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The founding director of the center was Stephen Straus. In 2008, Josephine Briggs became the second director of NCCAM. The NCCAM was renamed the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) in December 2014. In August 2018, Helene Langevin was named director of the NCCIH.

The 2014 name change to NCCIH has been described by critics as an attempt by the center to mitigate criticism by avoiding the term &quot;alternative&quot; and distancing itself from having funded studies of questionable merit.

The 2001 mission statement of the NCCAM stated that it was &quot;dedicated to exploring complementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science; training complementary and alternative medicine researchers; and disseminating authoritative information to the public and professionals.&quot;

As NCCIH, the mission statement is &quot;to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of complementary and alternative medicine interventions and their roles in improving health and health care&quot;.

===As the OAM (1991–1998)===

Joseph J. Jacobs was appointed the first director of the OAM in 1992. Jacobs&#x27; support for rigorous scientific methodology caused friction with Democrat U.S. Senator Tom Harkin and other OAM patrons. Harkin believed his allergies had been cured by bee pollen pills and expressed frustration with the &quot;unbendable rules&quot; of randomized clinical trials, saying, &quot;it is not necessary for the scientific community to understand the process before the American public can benefit from these therapies.&quot; Harkin&#x27;s office reportedly pressured the OAM to fund studies of favored theories, including the use of bee pollen and antineoplastons as treatments. OAM board member Barrie Cassileth publicly criticized the office as a purveyor of nonsense and described it as a &quot;place where opinions are counted as equal to data&quot;. After Harkin appeared on television in 1994 with cancer patients who blamed Jacobs for blocking their access to antineoplastons, Jacobs resigned from the OAM in frustration. In an interview with &quot;Science&quot;, Jacobs criticized Harkin and other politicians for pressuring his office, promoting certain therapies, and, he says, attempting an end-run around objective science.&quot;

Harkin drew support from Iowa Democrat Representative Berkley Bedell, who believed that cow colostrum had cured his Lyme disease.

The OAM&#x27;s budget grew in the 1990s. The office drew increasing criticism for its perceived lack of rigorous scientific study of alternative approaches favoring uncritical boosterism. Paul Berg, a Nobel laureate in chemistry, wrote to the Senate that &quot;Quackery will always prey on the gullible and uninformed, but we should not provide it with cover from the NIH,&quot; and called the office &quot;an embarrassment to serious scientists&quot;. Allen Bromley, then-president of the American Physical Society, similarly wrote to Congress that the OAM had &quot;emerged as an undiscriminating advocate of unconventional medicine. It has bestowed the considerable prestige of the NIH on a variety of highly dubious practices, some of which clearly violate basic laws of physics&quot;. Leon Jaroff, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1997, described the OAM as &quot;Tom Harkin&#x27;s folly&quot;.

In 1995, Wayne Jonas, a promoter of homeopathy and political ally of Harkin, became the director of the OAM, and continued in that role until 1999. In 1997, the NCCAM budget was increased from $12 million to $20 million annually. From 1990 to 1997, use of alternative medicine in the US increased by 25%, with a corresponding 50% increase in expenditures. The OAM drew increasing criticism from eminent members of the scientific community with letters to the Senate Appropriations Committee when discussion of renewal of funding OAM came up. In 1998, the President of the North Carolina Medical Association publicly called for shutting down the OAM.

In 1998, NIH director and Nobel laureate Harold Varmus came into conflict with Harkin by pushing to have more NIH control of alternative medicine research. The NIH Director placed the OAM under stricter scientific NIH control. Harkin responded by elevating OAM into an independent NIH &quot;center&quot;, just short of being its own &quot;institute&quot;, and renamed it the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). NCCAM had a mandate to promote a more rigorous and scientific approach to the study of alternative medicine, research training and career development, outreach, and &quot;integration&quot;.

Stephen Strauss was the director of NCCAM from 1999 to 2006. He tried to bring more scientific rigor to the organization. In 1999 the NCCAM budget was increased from $20 million to $50 million. The United States Congress approved the appropriations without dissent. In 2000, the budget was increased to about $68 million, in 2001 to $90 million, in 2002 to $104 million, and in 2003, to $113 million.

===As NCCAM (1998–2014)===

In 2008 Josephine Briggs was appointed as director of NCCAM. She was &quot;a nephrologist with impeccable scientific credentials&quot;. The appointment was considered surprising since she did not have a complementary and alternative medicine background or integrative medicine background. Writing for Science-Based Medicine, David Gorski states Briggs was in an impossible position: &quot;She was a real scientist trying to impose scientific rigor on an enterprise that was inherently resistant to such an imposition.&quot; She attempted to impose a more scientific approach with two long-term strategic plans. The plans used &quot;one of the most harmful tactics of quacks to legitimize their quackery under the banner of &#x27;integrative medicine,&#x27; the co-opting of the opioid crisis as an excuse to claim all nonpharmacological treatments for pain as being &#x27;integrative.&#x27; The results are threatening great harm to chronic pain patients by misguided governments wanting to force them to undergo quack treatments like acupuncture as a means of getting them off opioids.&quot; However, she was able to eliminate studies on homeopathy and tried to counter anti-vaccine beliefs. Energy healing was &quot;relegated to the fringes, if not eliminated&quot;. Most of the studies became centered around nutrition, exercise, pharmacognosy, &quot;and other modalities within the realm of science-based medicine&quot;.

In 2009, after 17 years of government testing for $2.5 billion, almost no clearly proven efficacy of alternative therapies had been found. Senator Harkin complained, &quot;One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches. Quite frankly, I must say publicly that it has fallen short. I think quite frankly that in this center and the office previously before it, most of its focus has been on disproving things rather than seeking out and approving.&quot; Members of the scientific community criticized this comment as showing Harkin did not understand the basics of scientific inquiry, which tests hypotheses, but never intentionally attempts to &quot;validate approaches&quot;. In 2009, the NCCAM&#x27;s yearly budget was increased to about $122 million. Overall NIH funding for CAM research increased to $300 million by 2009. By 2009, Americans were spending $34 billion annually on CAM.

In 2012, the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (&quot;JAMA&quot;) published a criticism that NCCAM had funded study after study, but had &quot;failed to prove that complementary or alternative therapies are anything more than placebos&quot;. The &quot;JAMA&quot; criticism pointed to large wasting of research money on testing scientifically implausible treatments, citing &quot;NCCAM officials spending $374,000 to find that inhaling lemon and lavender scents does not promote wound healing; $750,000 to find that prayer does not cure AIDS or hasten recovery from breast-reconstruction surgery; $390,000 to find that ancient Indian remedies do not control type 2 diabetes; $700,000 to find that magnets do not treat arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or migraine headaches; and $406,000 to find that coffee enemas do not cure pancreatic cancer.&quot; It was pointed out that the public generally ignored negative results from testing, that people continue to &quot;believe what they want to believe, arguing that it does not matter what the data show: They know what works for them&quot;. Continued increasing use of CAM products was also blamed on the lack of FDA ability to regulate alternative products, where negative studies do not result in FDA warnings or FDA-mandated changes on labeling, whereby few consumers are aware that many claims of many supplements were found not to be supported.

===As NCCIH (2014–present)===

In 2014, while Josephine Briggs was the director, the NCCAM was renamed the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). Briggs retired in October 2017.

On August 29, 2018, the NCCIH announced Helene Langevin as the new director. She was previously the director of the Osher Center and professor-in-residence of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Her medical interests involve connective tissue. Langevin &quot;believes that the stretching of connective tissue is how several CAM modalities &#x27;work,&#x27; such as chiropractic, massage, and ... acupuncture&quot;. Langevin has been studying acupuncture since the 1990s. At the time of her appointment, Gorski expressed concern that the balance of power at NCCIH would &quot;shift back towards pseudoscience&quot; with a massive budget to fund the shift.

===Operations===

The NCCIH operates under a charter set by the National Advisory Council for Complementary and Integrative Health (NACCIH). The charter states that:Of the 18 appointed members (of the council) 12 shall be selected from among the leading representatives of the health and scientific disciplines (including not less than 2 individuals who are leaders in the fields of public health and the behavioral or social sciences) relevant to the activities of NCCIH, particularly representatives of the health and scientific disciplines in the area of complementary and alternative medicine. Nine of the members shall be practitioners licensed in one or more of the major systems with which the Center is involved. Six of the members shall be appointed by the Secretary from the general public and shall include leaders in public policy, law, health policy, economics, and management. Three of the six shall represent the interests of individual consumers of complementary and alternative medicine.

==Research areas and funding==

=== Research focus ===
NCCIH funds research into complementary and alternative medicine, including support for clinical trials of CAM techniques. The four primary areas of focus are research, research training and career development, outreach, and integration. NCCIH divides complementary and alternative medicine into natural products, including dietary supplements and herbal supplements; mind and body practices, including meditation, yoga, qigong, acupuncture and spinal manipulation (both chiropractic and osteopathic); and other approaches, such as homeopathy, naturopathy, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and ayurveda.

=== Funding trajectory ===
Since 1999, the division&#x27;s funding increased more than six-fold. By 2012, OAM and NCCAM spent $1.6 billion in grant funding. Between 1999 and 2009, NCCAM supported approximately 50% of the National Cancer Institute spending on CAM, with the total amount spent on CAM during that time frame $2.856 billion.

The NCCIH budget for 2005 was $123 million. For fiscal year 2009 (ending September 30, 2009), it was $122 million.

The NIH has also conducted research in alternative medicine at the National Cancer Institute by the Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine which, in 2009, had the same $122 million budget as NCCIH. For FY 2009; NIH&#x27;s total budget was about $29 billion.

The NCCIH budget for 2015 was $124.1 million. They requested a $3,459,000 funding increase for their 2016 budget.

==== Examples of NCCAM research projects funded prior to 2012 ====
Of 52 CAM clinical trial studies on HIV and Cancer, only 8 reported results.

==== Education ====
NCCAM also funds education and outreach programs. Despite the negative findings on the effectiveness of distance healing, NCCAM awarded $180,000 to a consultant to develop an Internet-based wellness program on the healing by Qigong.

==Criticism==

NCCIH has been criticized by Steven E. Nissen, Stephen Barrett, and Kimball Atwood among others, for funding, along with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute a study of EDTA chelation therapy for coronary artery disease, which lasted about 10 years and cost about $31 million, even though smaller, controlled trials found chelation ineffective. Other NCCIH-funded studies have included the benefits of distant prayer for AIDS, the effects of lemon and lavender essential oils on wound healing, &quot;energy chelation&quot;, and &quot;rats stressed out by white noise&quot;.

In 2006, NCCIH was criticized in &quot;Science&quot; with the comment &quot;NCCAM funds proposals of dubious merit; its research agenda is shaped more by politics than by science, and its charter structures it in a manner that precludes an independent review of its performance.&quot; The authors suggested that, while it was appropriate to study alternative therapies, the quality of its research was lower than other NIH institutes and that these studies could be performed under the auspices of other institutes within the NIH. As an example, the authors described a trial of gemcitabine with the Gonzalez regimen for stage II to IV pancreatic cancer, in the belief that a deficiency of pancreatic proteolytic enzymes causes cancer. Severe adverse effects were associated with the Gonzalez regimen, and no evidence in peer-reviewed journals supported the plausibility or efficacy of the regimen or chelation therapy.

A 2012 study published in the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; examined the grants and awards funded by NCCIH from 2000 to 2011, which totaled $1.3 billion. The study found no discoveries in complementary and alternative medicine that would justify the existence of this center. The authors argued that after 20 years and an expenditure of $2 billion, the failure of NCCIH was evidenced by the lack of publications and the failure to report clinical trials in peer-reviewed medical journals. They recommended that NCCIH be defunded or abolished and the concept of funding alternative medicine be discontinued.

In 2019, an analysis by the Center for Inquiry found that NCCIH was continuing to fund questionable science and that &quot;there is little hope of reforming the NCCIH as it is currently incorporated&quot;. It concluded that &quot;There is no legitimate function that the NCCIH can serve that could not be better carried out by other existing organizations within the NIH umbrella.&quot;

Writing for Quackwatch in 2023, William London criticized the NCCIH and its article &quot;6 Things To Know When Selecting a Complementary Health Practitioner&quot; for &quot;misleading consumers&quot; and promoting—rather than warning against—complementary health, which &quot;is often a euphemism for quackery.&quot;

<doc id="391045" wikidata="Q994959" url="?curid=391045" title="Bryan Allen (ice hockey)">
<text>Bryan Nigel Allen (born August 21, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) between 2001 and 2014.

==Playing career==
Allen was the fourth overall selection in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft to the Vancouver Canucks. A big, bruising defender with a mean streak, Allen earned comparisons to Derian Hatcher at the time of his selection.

Allen made the Canucks at age 18 in his first camp, but was unable to reach a contract with the team&#x27;s management and returned to the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)&#x27;s Oshawa Generals, his junior team. Despite being limited to 37 out of his team&#x27;s 66 games, his strong leadership style of play earned him OHL First All-Star Team honours. He was also selected to represent Canada at the 1999 World Junior Championships.

After missing substantial parts of the two previous seasons due to injury, he missed virtually all of the 1999–00 campaign following surgery.

Allen would play most of his first two professional seasons in minor-pro before earning a regular roster spot in the 2002–03 season, appearing in 48 games and scoring 5 goals. With the departure of Murray Baron in the summer of 2003, Allen became a regular for the Canucks and did a fine job of replacing Baron&#x27;s size and physical play. He was especially a standout on the penalty kill, logging heavy minutes as the Canucks finished near the top of the NHL in that category. On November 5, Allen was suspended for two games following an incident on November 3 in which he slashed Detroit Red Wings forward Henrik Zetterberg, breaking his leg.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Allen suited up for Khimik Voskresensk of the Russian Superleague (RSL) to stay in game shape. Back in Vancouver for the 2005–06 season, with the departures of Marek Malík and Brent Sopel, as well as long-term injuries to several other defenders, Allen&#x27;s icetime skyrocketed and he became one of the team&#x27;s most important defenders, finishing with career highs of 7 goals and 17 points.

On June 23, 2006, Allen was involved in a multi-player trade that sent him, Todd Bertuzzi and Alex Auld to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Roberto Luongo, Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth-round draft pick. The 2006–07 season would be the best of his career to date, as he set career highs with 21 assists and 25 points and established himself as one of the Panthers&#x27; top defenders.

A knee injury caused Allen to miss all but two games of the 2008–09 season with the Panthers.

On February 28, 2011, Allen was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for forward Sergei Samsonov.

On July 1, 2012 Allen signed a three-year contract as a free agent with the Anaheim Ducks. On November 20, 2014 during the 2014–15 season, the final year of his contract, Allen was traded to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for forward Rene Bourque.

==International play==

Allen represented Canada at the World Junior Championships. He recorded one goal and three points in 7 games to help Canada to a silver medal. His goal was a huge one, the tying goal late in the final against Russia, but Russia would ultimately win in overtime.

Allen was expected to be a leader for Canada at the 2000 World Junior Championships, but was unable to play as he was recovering from injury.

<doc id="391048" wikidata="Q263477" url="?curid=391048" title="Buckingham Palace Garden">
<text>Buckingham Palace Garden is a large private park attached to the London residence of the British monarch. It is situated to the rear (west) of Buckingham Palace, occupying a site in the City of Westminster and forms the largest private garden in London. It is bounded by Constitution Hill to the north, Hyde Park Corner to the west, Grosvenor Place to the south-west, and the Royal Mews, King&#x27;s Gallery, and Buckingham Palace itself to the south and east.

The royal connection to the site of the garden dates from 1609 when James I purchased four acres of land &quot;near to his palace of Westminster for the planting of mulberry trees&quot;. The garden covers much of the area of the former Goring Great Garden, named after Lord Goring, occupant of one of the earliest grand houses on the site. In 1664 Goring&#x27;s mansion, and the lease on the grounds, was bought by Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington. In 1674 the house was destroyed by fire and Arlington built a replacement, named Arlington House, on the site. This house was sold by Arlington&#x27;s daughter to John Sheffield, Earl of Mulgrave. Created Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1703, Buckingham commissioned a new mansion for the site, named Buckingham House. His architect was William Talman and his builder William Winde. Similar attention was paid to the landscape, where Buckingham engaged Henry Wise to lay out an elaborate garden in the French style, with parterres and a central canal. In the late 18th century, Buckingham House was acquired by George III whose heir, George IV used John Nash to remodel the house which was renamed Buckingham Palace. Nash engaged William Townsend Aiton to implement designs for a new garden. Aiton&#x27;s work forms the basis of the garden that exists today.

Buckingham Palace Garden is the setting for monarch&#x27;s annual garden parties. In June 2002, Queen Elizabeth II invited the public into the garden for entertainment for the first time during her reign. As part of her Golden Jubilee Weekend thousands of Britons were invited to apply for tickets to Party at the Palace where the guitarist Brian May of the band Queen performed his &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; guitar solo on top of Buckingham Palace. This concert was preceded the previous evening by a Prom at the Palace. During the Queen&#x27;s 80th birthday celebrations in 2006 the garden was the scene of Children&#x27;s Party at the Palace.

The garden is Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The planting is varied and exotic, with a mulberry tree dating back to the time of James I. Notable features include a large 19th-century lake which was once graced by a flock of flamingoes, and the Waterloo Vase. There is also a summerhouse attributed to William Kent, a helicopter landing pad on the great lawn below the West Terrace, and a tennis court. Unlike the nearby Royal Parks of London, Buckingham Palace Garden is not usually open to the public. However, when the palace is open during August and September, visitors have access to part of the garden, which forms the exit, via a gift shop in a marquee, at the end of the tour.

==History==

The garden at Buckingham Palace was formed from that created for the palace&#x27;s predecessor, Buckingham House. The landscape design for the earlier garden was by Henry Wise. He constructed an elaborate formal garden with a long central canal running south from the rear of the house. Wise was paid the substantial sum of £1,000 per year for his services. Subsequently, work was undertaken by Capability Brown, who planned more than was achieved. The garden was redesigned at the time of the palace rebuilding by William Townsend Aiton of Kew Gardens and John Nash for George IV. The great manmade lake was completed in 1828 and was supplied with water from the Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park.

Beyond the lake is an artificial rise, called The Mound, made partly from soil that was excavated to build the lake. It was constructed to obscure the view of the Royal Mews from the palace. During the Victorian era, Prince Albert had a pavilion built on the mound. Known as the Milton, or Comus Pavilion, it was decorated with scenes from John Milton&#x27;s masque &quot;Comus&quot;, painted by some of the leading artists of the day. Derelict after World War I, the pavilion was pulled down in 1928. 

The garden is maintained by approximately eight full-time gardeners, with two or three part-timers. The trees include plane, Indian chestnut, silver maple, and a swamp cypress. In the south-west corner, there is a single surviving mulberry tree from the plantation installed by King James I of England when he unsuccessfully attempted to breed silkworms in the Mulberry Garden on the Buckingham Palace site. The garden now holds the UK&#x27;s national collection of mulberry trees, housing some 40 varieties.

The garden is regularly surveyed for its moths by staff from the Natural History Museum, and occasionally visited by the Queen&#x27;s swans. A tennis court was constructed in the garden in 1919 and, in the 1930s, the future George VI played Fred Perry on the court. In 2006 the garden was the site of the &quot;Big Royal Dig&quot; by the Time Team of archaeologists led by Tony Robinson. The results were televised, with some live streaming. Timed to help celebrate the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II, this marked &quot;Time Team&quot;&#x27;s 150th dig.

The garden is not generally open to the public but visitors to the palace during its summer opening exit through the garden. Private tours are occasionally available.

===Garden parties===

The garden is the setting for the Royal Garden Parties held by the reigning monarch. Although earlier Royal owners had held entertainments in the garden, the tradition of large, formal, garden parties was established by Victoria, for whose Golden and Diamond Jubilees, two particularly lavish parties were held in 1887 and 1897. Three garden parties are held at Buckingham Palace, and one at the Palace of Holyroodhouse (in Scotland) each summer. The monarch also gives permission for additional garden parties to be held; in 2008, parties were held for the Centenary of the Royal Charter to the British Red Cross, the Territorial Army, the Not Forgotten Association and for those attending the Lambeth Conference. Some 30,000 guests attend the parties each year, which recommenced in 2022, after a two-year abeyance due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nominations for invitations to the garden parties are made by the Lord-lieutenants, government departments, the armed forces, the Diplomatic corps and a range of charities and societies. The nominations, which are intended to acknowledge public service, are approved by the Lord Chamberlain, who then issues the invitations in the name of the king. 

Guests take tea and sandwiches in marquees erected in the garden. Just prior to 4.00 p.m. the king and accompanying members of the Royal Family emerge from the Bow Room in the palace, as a band plays the National Anthem. The royal party then process through ranks of assembled guests towards the Royal Tea Tent, greeting those previously selected for the honour. A second private tea tent is reserved for diplomatic guests, while all other attendees make use of the general tent. Two military bands alternate in playing a &quot;continuous supply of festive music&quot;.

The garden, the largest in London, covers and contains over 1,000 trees, 325 specimens of wild plants and 35 different species of birds. The largely-flat site forms a rough triangle with Buckingham Palace at the apex. The western (rear) facade opens on to a long terrace, the West Terrace, which overlooks a large lawn, known as the Main Lawn. Beyond the lawn is the lake. The whole is surrounded by a wall and, internally, by a gravel path which runs around the garden&#x27;s perimeter, with branches diverting around the lawns, lake and island flowerbeds. The dominating species of tree is the London Plane &quot;Platanus × hispanica&quot;. There are a large number of commemorative trees, planted to celebrate royal occasions, which continues a tradition begun by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. 24 trees within the garden are designated as &quot;Champion Trees&quot; on the Tree Register of the British Isles.

===Architectural features===
The garden has a number of architectural features. Among the most notable is the Waterloo Vase, a great urn commissioned by Napoleon to commemorate his expected victories, which in 1815 was presented unfinished to the Prince Regent. After the King had had the base completed by sculptor Richard Westmacott, intending it to be the focal point of the new Waterloo chamber at Windsor Castle, it was adjudged to be too heavy for any floor (at high and weighing 15 tons). The National Gallery, to whom it was presented, finally returned it in 1906 to the sovereign, Edward VII. King Edward then solved the problem by placing the vase outside in the garden where it now remains. A pair of ornamental cranes which stand by the lake were presented to Edward when on a tour of India as Prince of Wales in 1875-6.

===Summerhouse and statuary===

A summerhouse stands opposite the Waterloo Vase, which was removed from the old Admiralty garden at the other end of The Mall. The structure is in the form of a small temple, with a pediment supported by four Atlantes. Peter Coats, in his study of 1978, &quot;The Gardens of Buckingham Palace&quot;, notes stylistic similarities to the work of William Kent. Much of the statuary in the garden, including vases and urns on the West Terrace, was designed by Nash, and constructed in Coade Stone, a form of artificial stone popular in the Regency and Victorian periods.

===Lake, Tennis Court, Lawn and Stonework===
There is also a lake and a tennis court, the latter dating from 1919. The lake is long and across and used to be home to a colony of flamingo until they were killed by foxes. The lake was originally fed from The Serpentine in Hyde Park, but is now sourced from a bore hole in the garden. The water is aerated by a waterfall, installed by Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, to replace a cascade constructed by the Queen&#x27;s parents, George VI and Queen Elizabeth. The large island in the lake houses four beehives where, since 1983, honey has been produced. Helicopters land on the great lawn in front of the West Terrace. The garden contains a number of examples of another type of artificial stonework, Pulhamite, including two bridges to the islands in the lake and a large rockery.

===Critical views===
Simon Bradley, in the 2003 revised edition of the Pevsner Buildings of England, &quot;London 6: Westminster&quot;, describes the garden at Buckingham Palace as &quot;beautiful&quot;, noting particularly the &quot;irregular lake and artful Picturesque planting&quot;. The design of the garden has also been criticised; suggesting that, after Wise, no major designer was employed, a writer for &quot;Country Life&quot; concluded that it lacked any of the features of a truly great garden, &quot;originality, surprise, vista, architecture, statuary, planting&quot;, although they acknowledged the garden&#x27;s utility as a &quot;helicopter landing pad&quot;.

===Listing designations===
The garden is Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. The Waterloo Vase and the Kent Summerhouse are Grade I listed structures. Structures on the perimeter of the garden which are also listed at Grade I include the surrounding boundary wall; the garden entrance screen to the front right of the palace, the screen to the Ambassadors&#x27; Court to the left and the main entrance to the Ambassadors&#x27; Court on Buckingham Palace Road; the wall enclosing the royal riding school, and the riding school itself; the Royal Mews; and two flanking lodges. A secondary section of the mews, and four lamp posts in front of the riding school are listed at Grade II.

<doc id="391054" wikidata="Q224986" url="?curid=391054" title="France-Albert René">
<text>France-Albert René (; 16 November 1934 – 27 February 2019) was a Seychellois lawyer, politician and statesman who served as the second President of Seychelles from 1977 to 2004. He also served as the country&#x27;s second Prime Minister from its independence in 1976 to 1977.

He was nicknamed by Seychellois government officials and fellow party members as &quot;the Boss&quot;. His name is often given as simply Albert René or F. A. René; he was also nicknamed Ti France.

== Early life ==

France-Albert René was born to Price René, a plantation manager and administrator, and Luisa Morgan René, a seamstress, on 16 November 1934 in Victoria, on the island of Mahé, Crown Colony of Seychelles, but spent his early childhood on Farquhar. The &quot;modest&quot; family did not belong to the upper class, despite their European origins. The family returned to Victoria, Mahé when France-Albert was 5 years old and was sent to St Joseph&#x27;s Convent, and later to St Louis College. With the help of scholarships, René was able to attend secondary education at Saint Louis College of the Marist Brothers in Victoria on Mahé. In 1952, at the age of 17, René was granted a scholarship in Switzerland to study theology at the Capuchin Seminary of St Maurice in the canton Valais. After his first year, in 1954, he was transferred to study law at St. Mary&#x27;s College, Southampton, England, and later completed his university education at King&#x27;s College London. In 1957 he qualified as a lawyer at King&#x27;s College London, serving until 1961, and joined Middle Temple. While abroad, he became heavily involved in the politics of the Labour Party, at the time led by Clement Attlee and later Hugh Gaitskell. These experiences led him to adopt a moderate socialist ideology that favoured some state intervention in the economy and strong ties with conservative forces such as the Roman Catholic Church – René&#x27;s initial career goal was to join the priesthood. Later, René denounced local church leaders who criticised his policies. From 1962 to 1964 he also studied economics at the London School of Economics. Upon returning to his homeland in 1964, young and enthusiastic René practiced law in Victoria. However, he became disappointed with the social policies of British colonialism that created massive injustice among the population. As a result, he decided to participate in the political development of his country. René also launched a newspaper, The People.

=== Politics ===

It was not until 1964 that any new political movements were created. In that year, the Seychelles People&#x27;s United Party (SPUP, later Seychelles People&#x27;s Progressive Front, SPPF), the forerunner to today&#x27;s party United Seychelles (US), was formed. Led by France-Albert René, a founding member, they campaigned for socialism and independence from Britain. The late London-trained lawyer James Mancham&#x27;s Seychelles Democratic Party (SDP), created the same year, by contrast represented conservatives, businessmen and planters and wanted closer integration with Britain. After being elected to the legislative assembly of the colony in 1965, together with his party comrades, he actively fought for granting it self-government, and then independence. Elections were held in 1966, won by the SDP. In 1970 Seychelles obtained a new constitution, universal adult suffrage, and a governing council with an elected majority.

In March 1970, colonial and political representatives of Seychelles met in London for a constitutional convention, with the Seychelles Democratic Party (SDP) of James Mancham advocating closer integration with the UK, and the Seychelles People&#x27;s United Party (SPUP) of France-Albert René advocating independence. Further elections in November 1970 brought a new constitution into effect, with Mancham as Chief Minister. Further elections were held in April 1974, in which both major political parties campaigned for independence. In 1975, in the colonial government, he became Minister of Public Works and Land Development of the coalition government, which also included representatives of the Democratic Party (DP). Following the election, negotiations with the British resulted in an agreement under which the Seychelles became an independent republic within the Commonwealth on 29 June 1976. The newly knighted Sir James Mancham became the country&#x27;s first President, with René as Prime Minister, following assembly elections in which the Seychelles People&#x27;s United Party (SPUP) came in second place. These negotiations also restored the islands of Aldabra, Farquhar, and Des Roches, which had been transferred from Seychelles in November 1965 to form part of the new British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), to Seychelles upon independence.

=== 1977 coup ===

When Mancham told him he had been seen practicing with rifles on an uninhabited island, Rene coolly told him he had been &quot;shooting rabbits&quot;, and had a brace delivered to the president&#x27;s office.

While James Mancham was away overseas to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference in London and celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, on 4–5 June 1977, less than a year after independence, between 60 and 200 partisan Tanzanian-trained supporters of René installed him as President of the Republic in an almost bloodless coup d&#x27;état. René&#x27;s claim that he was not party to the coup was challenged during hearing of the Truth, Reconciliation and National Unity Commission in 2019 and 2020 when known a participant acknowledged that he had been involved in the planning and execution. The insurgents took control of strategic points on Mahé. The central police station was seized &quot;virtually without a shot being fired.&quot; In contrast, there was an exchange of fire at the Mont Fleuri police station, where the arsenal was kept. Three men were killed and a policeman and one of the insurgents were killed in the fighting. The plotters arrested six British Armed Forces officers, who had been advising the Seychelles Police Force since 1976. The officers and their families, as well as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Aiden O&#x27;Brien Quinn, a judge from Ireland similarly on loan by his Government, were flown to Europe; the island was put under curfew.

When approached by the insurgents, René was said to have accepted the Presidency on three conditions: that the safety of political individuals be guaranteed, that international agreements remain in force, and that elections be planned for 1978 (they were eventually held in 1979). René, who denied knowing of the plan, was then sworn in as president and formed a new government. After coming to power, René declared that he was not a Soviet-style Communist, but rather an &quot;Indian Ocean socialist&quot; and &quot;socialist pan-Africanist&quot;. Early on he opposed the Anglo-American military installation on the Indian Ocean atoll of Diego Garcia because of the possible storage of nuclear weapons. René discouraged over-dependence on tourism and declared that he wanted &quot;to keep the Seychelles for the Seychellois&quot;.

== &quot;Socialist paradise&quot; ==

=== Domestic policies ===

René&#x27;s party, renamed the Seychelles People&#x27;s Progressive Front &quot;(&quot;SPPF) in 1978, was the sole legal party from 1979 to 1991, largely financed from Tanzania, Algeria, Libya and the GDR. The newly reformed system of one-party socialism featured a directly elected president, as well as the original plurality system of legislative representation. All political activity took place under the rule of the Seychelles People&#x27;s Progressive Front, and the President was voted for on a yes-no basis by any Seychelles citizen 17 or older. The President enjoyed almost unchecked executive power, and appointed his own cabinet as well as his own chair of the National Assembly. The legislature itself was unable to rule independently, and instead only enacted the bills proposed by the executive. Criticism of René or any aspect of his government was not tolerated. 
This allowed him to be the only presidential candidate for elections in 1979, 1984, and 1989, which he won with over 90% of the vote. Multiparty democracy commenced around 1994, but René continued to win in 1993, and in 1998 and 2001, when he defeated the opposition leader Wavel Ramkalawan, the candidate of the Seychelles National Party. In addition to the presidency, he held several cabinet posts simultaneously, including Minister of Foreign Affairs (1977–1979) and Minister of Finance (1981–1989), Minister of Finance and Industry (1984–1989), Minister of Planning and External Relations (1986–93), Minister of Interior and Defence, Minister of Industry (since 1998). In 1988 he added the role of Minister of Tourism. The last addition was ironic, as he grudgingly acknowledged in private that he would be happier if no foreigners ever visited. In 1978-84 he also served as chairman, and from June 1984 Secretary General of the SPPF. In 1979, a planned invasion of Seychelles by supporters of Sir James Mancham with the assistance of American diplomatic staff in Kenya and Seychelles was discovered before it could be carried out. An official investigation also implicated France with involvement in the coup.

The SPPF instituted a number of reforms, including universal access to education and healthcare, as well as environmental reforms. Compared to the rest of Africa, the Seychelles scored well in terms of child mortality, literacy rate, median income and standard of living. During this period, the Seychelles developed rapidly, to the point that it became the most developed country in Africa on the Human Development Index. The situation for Seychellois Creole people, who constitute the majority of the nation&#x27;s population, also improved significantly due to domestic policies implemented by President René aimed at racial equity. However, the white minority (mainly Franco-Seychellois) still occupied most important posts (ministerial and parliamentary) in the state administration and dominated the ranks of the party leadership. Like his predecessor Mancham, he focused on expanding tourism. In order to finance social spending, René also promoted the settlement of international banks and established an offshore financial center. Despite the occasional coup attempts, his regime was considered stable due to the balancing of interests between socialism and capitalism.

=== Foreign policy ===

Diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China were established on 30 June 1976. China began providing Seychelles with diplomatic aid in 1977, including things such as constructing a poly-technical school and developing housing project in Les Mamelles. In 2002, China exported US$1.48 million worth of goods, while importing only $100,000 from Seychelles.

Diplomatic ties with India have existed since Seychelles gained independence in 1976. A resident high commissioner of India has been in Victoria since 1987 while Seychelles opened its resident mission in New Delhi in 2008. Relations between the two countries have been warm and cordial with regular high-level exchange visits between the countries. From India, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Presidents R Venkataraman and Pratibha Patil have visited the Seychelles, while Rene, Michel and Faure of Seychelles have paid state visits to India.

In 1986, Seychelles brought around US$600,000 in Malaysian products directly, but purchased U$7 million through indirect trade with Singapore, looking for direct trade with Malaysia to get Malaysian products without using Singapore ports. In 1988, an agreement to promote co-operation in the fields of culture, education, sports and information was signed.

During the rule of René, the socialist and non-aligned government of Seychelles – a small African Indian Ocean island nation – maintained close relations with the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, commonly known as North Korea. The country received significant North Korean developmental aid. Much of the cooperation was military. Uniformed North Korean soldiers were present in the country in 1980. Another example of military cooperation was the 1983 deployment of fifty-five North Korean instructors and interpreters to aid the military of Seychelles. During his time in power, René visited Pyongyang several times, meeting with Kim Il Sung. During one meeting in 1988, he expressed support for Korean reunification, and applauded the idea of a Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo. At the end of that visit, the two countries signed a treaty of economic cooperation.

Relations between Seychelles and the Soviet Union were established a day after the island nation gained its independence from the UK. On 15 February 1980, the USSR and Seychelles signed the &quot;Agreement on merchant navigation&quot; in Victoria. The government of René supported the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In 1987 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, quoting unnamed US intelligence officers, reported that the Soviet Union had landed 50 naval infantry troops in the Seychelles after making landfall on the &quot;Ivan Rogov&quot; in October 1986; a month after a foiled assassination attempt on René. In 1999 an agreement on co-operation in the field of tourism was concluded between the two nations.

The year 1963 marked the beginning of an official U.S. presence in Seychelles when the U.S. Air Force Tracking Station was built and put into operation on Mahé. The USAF Tracking Station facilities were situated on land that was leased from the Seychelles Government ($4.5 million annually). The station&#x27;s complement consisted of five uniformed Air Force personnel (two officers and three sergeants), 65 employees of Loral Corporation and Johnson Instruments, and 150 Seychellois employees. The USAF Tracking Station officially closed down on 30 September 1996. Peace Corps Volunteers served in Seychelles between 1974 and 1995. A U.S. consulate was opened in May 1976 and became an Embassy after Seychelles&#x27; independence in June 1976. The Embassy was subsequently closed in August 1996, and the United States opened a consular agency on 2 September 1996, to provide services to residents of Seychelles. The agency is under the supervision of the American Embassy in Port Louis, Mauritius. The U.S. Ambassador to Mauritius also is accredited to Seychelles.

=== Coups d&#x27;état ===

Numerous coup attempts were thwarted during the 1980s; there were three of them in just the first 2.5 years of government, and similar attempts were also made in 1981, 1982, 1986 and 1987. On 25 November 1981, Seychellois security forces put down a coup attempt sponsored by South Africa. Notorious British Colonel &quot;Mad Mike&quot; Hoare and a team of 43 mercenaries posed as members of the &quot;Ancient Order of Froth Blowers&quot;, a defunct charitable beer-drinking fraternity, visiting the islands as tourists. Shortly after leaving their Royal Swazi National Airways aircraft, an airport security guard spotted a Kalashnikov assault rifle in their luggage; the discovery launched a gun battle in which hostages were taken. Most of the mercenaries escaped after hijacking another Air India plane sitting on the runway.

The author John Perkins has alleged that this was part of a covert action to re-install the pro-American former president in the face of concerns about United States access to its military bases in Diego Garcia.[&quot;&quot;]

An independent inquiry by the United Nations found that South African intelligence was indeed behind the coup; Hoare described the reaction he received from a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent in Pretoria as &quot;extremely timid&quot;. However, it is suspected by Perkins that the United States played a significant direct role in the incident, given that there was co-operation at the time between the CIA and the South African government on other issues. Three million dollars were paid to President René and his government by South Africa for the return of the remaining mercenaries detained in the Seychelles. The 1981 attempt was the second major threat to his government at the time.

The government was threatened again by an army mutiny in August 1982, but it was quelled after 2 days when loyal troops, reinforced by Tanzanian forces &amp; several of the mercenaries that had escaped from the prison, recaptured the rebel-held installations. In the attempts to overthrow him at times resembled a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, he kept such an iron grip on the islands that would-be counter-revolutionaries went in fear of their lives.

Gérard Hoarau, of the exiled opposition, was head of the Mouvement Pour La Resistance (MPR). His opposition to the dictatorship of René was based in London and he was assassinated on 29 November 1985 by an unidentified gunman on the doorstep of his London home. Hoarau is buried in London. In 1985, after the assassination of Hoarau, the Seychelles community in exile put together a program titled SIROP (Seychelles International Repatriation and Onward Program).

In 1986, an attempted coup led by the Seychelles Minister of Defence, Ogilvy Berlouis, caused President René to request assistance from India. In Operation Flowers are Blooming, the Indian naval vessel &quot;Vindhyagiri&quot; arrived in Port Victoria to help avert the coup. Despite these attempts, for the most part René ruled throughout this period with underground opposition at home. He used Seychelles&#x27; strategic importance to obtain significant help from both superpowers of the period without having to commit himself to either. With a suppressed opposition, he was able to power through much needed social reforms. In June 1986, the Indian Navy deployed the &quot;Vindhyagiri&quot; at the Seychelles Port of Victoria to abort an attempted coup against President Rene by Defence Minister Berlouis in what was called Operation Flowers are Blooming. India helped avert a further attempted coup by Berlouis in September 1986, when Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi lent President René his plane so that he could fly back from an international meeting in Harare to the Seychelles. President René reportedly took shelter in the resident of the Indian High Commissioner in Malé.

In February 1992, Conrad Greslé, a local accountant, landowner and advocate of multi-party democracy in Seychelles was arrested and charged with treason for allegedly planning to overthrow President René&#x27;s régime with the apparent aid of foreign mercenaries and with supposed CIA involvement. Greslé died in Seychelles in July 1992 and is survived by his wife Sylvia, son Neville and daughters Natasha and Yvette Greslé.

A number of Seychellois were displaced and exiled by the dictatorship. The Greslé family were one of a few landowners of largely French descent to remain after the coup d&#x27;état of 1977 – most had their land confiscated and were exiled. Any individual who publicly resisted the René régime was vulnerable to threats, intimidation, or exile throughout the 1980s. Disappearances and what appear to be politically motivated killing did take place but these are not officially documented or acknowledged.[&quot;&quot;] A number of Seychellois families are now calling for official acknowledgement of politically motivated violence subsequent to the 1977 coup. Although he was white, he found greatest support among the islanders with a clear African ancestry.

== Democracy ==

Faced with mounting pressure from the country&#x27;s primary sources of foreign aid, René&#x27;s administration began moving toward more democratic rule in the early 1990s. Following the collapse of the Berlin Wall and dissolution of the Soviet Union, at an Extraordinary Congress of the Seychelles People&#x27;s Progressive Front (SPPF) on 4 December 1991, under the pressure of the opposition and France and Great Britain, President René announced a return to the multiparty system of government after almost 16 years of one-party rule. On 27 December 1991, the Constitution of Seychelles was amended to allow for the registration of political parties. Among the exiles returning to Seychelles was James Mancham, who returned in April 1992 to revive his party, the Democratic Party (DP). By the end of that month, eight political parties had registered to contest the first stage of the transition process: election to the constitutional commission, which took place on 23–26 July 1992.

The constitutional commission was made up of 22 elected members, 14 from the SPPF and 8 from the DP. It commenced work on 27 August 1992, with both President René and Mancham calling for national reconciliation and consensus on a new democratic constitution. The first draft of a new constitution failed to receive the requisite 60% of voters in 1992, but an amended version was approved in 1993. A consensus text was agreed upon on 7 May 1993, and a referendum to approve it was called for 15–18 June. The draft was approved with 73.9% of the electorate in favor of it and 24.1% against.

The first multiparty presidential and legislative elections since 1974 held under the new constitution was held between 23 and 26 July 1993, as well as a resounding victory for President René. Three political groups contested the elections – the SPPF, the DP, and the United Opposition (UO) – a coalition of three smaller political parties, including Parti Seselwa. Two other smaller opposition parties threw in their lot with the DP. All participating parties and international observer groups accepted the results as &quot;free and fair&quot;.

Three candidates contested the 20–22 March 1998 presidential election: France-Albert René of the SPPF, James Mancham of the DP, and Wavel Ramkalawan. President René and his SPPF won by a landslide. The president&#x27;s popularity in elections jumped to 66.6% in 1998 from 59.5% in 1993, while the SPPF garnered 61.7% of the total votes cast in the 1998 National Assembly election, compared to 56.5% in 1993. In 1999, Mancham switched to the centrist liberal Seychelles National Party (SNP) which emerged as the major opposition party, losing to the SPPF in 2002 parliamentary election with 42% of the vote. In his State of the Nation Address 2004, France-Albert René said, “I trust that when you walk across our islands, you’ll conclude that I have done my duty as a Seychellois worker”.

== Resignation and later life ==

On 24 February 2004, René announced that he would be stepping down in favour of his long-time lieutenant, comrade and Vice-president James Alix Michel (who served until 2016), who had been in office since 1996. He did so on 14 July, whereupon he remained as leader of the People&#x27;s Progressive Front, which honored him as its patron and founder. Michel would go on to win the 2006 presidential election against SNP leader Ramkalawan with 53.5% of the vote. René&#x27;s political power, however, weakened with time, resulting in his party losing the 2016 parliamentary elections to the opposition. After stepping down in 2004, many believed René remained a powerful influence. However family members report that his successor, upon securing his position, &quot;abandoned&quot; René, rarely conversing or seeking advice from him except just before elections in a bid to get him to vocalise support. René endorsed a book, &quot;“Albert René – The Father of the Modern Seychelles”&quot; by British historian Dr. Kevin Shillington. The full-length biography, published in 2014, analyses his early years in politics and his struggle against colonialism.

René died on 27 February 2019 in Mahé, Seychelles in hospital from respiratory failure, aged 84. The former president had been admitted to hospital with an undisclosed illness for respiratory problems on 12 February.

Dolor Ernesta, who served as a minister in René&#x27;s government, said: “The President will be remembered as a true leader who led the fight for independence. I will also remember him as having a great vision for the development of the new Seychelles as we know it today, for he truly loved his country”. Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed condolences over the passing of René, stating that he had made important contributions to advancing the cause of China-Seychelles friendship.

=== Private life ===

In 1956, René married Englishwoman Karen Handley, with whom he had a daughter. Handley noted regarding the 1977 coup that “René plotted his communist revolution from my semi in Luton”. In 1975 France-Albert married Geva Savy Adam, a relationship that lasted until their divorce in 1992. He married for a third time in 1992, to Sarah Zarqani, 25 years his junior, with whom he had three daughters. She survived him with his children. René had numerous mistresses, regarding which he simply stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve always made a hobby out of fishing&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Until 2018 René was characterized as a prime example of a benevolent dictator as well as a well-loved and respected national figure, leading his country to the point of being the most developed country in Africa – as measured by the Human Development Index – and helping build one of the continent&#x27;s highest gross domestic products per capita.

However, the setting up of the Truth Reconciliation and National Unity Commission (TRNUC) in 2018, and their hearings (televised day after day in real time, and recorded on YouTube) revealed the testimonies of people who had been tortured, and from relatives of people who had been murdered, tortured, disappeared, assassinated, detained without trial, as well as evidence of financial crimes and looting of the state and private individuals, led to a reassessment of his record; critics of René believe that he and his party are responsible for torture and other human rights abuses involving opponents of the government, allegedly including the death of a prominent dissident in London, Gérard Hoarau. After the 1977 coup, a significant portion of the population, including the deposed President Sir James Mancham, fled to the UK and South Africa due to political persecution and fear of the new government&#x27;s expropriation and reprisals, and alignment with the Soviet Union, Tanzania and North Korea. Between 1977 and 1984 four thousand Seychellois left the country (mainly to Britain and South Africa). In the period from 1979 to 1989, according to official statistics, about 1 thousand people a year left the country (which is more than 1% of the country&#x27;s population). René also faced international pressure regarding his government&#x27;s former requirement that all applicants to the country&#x27;s secondary education system graduate a compulsory National Youth Service, which included traditional curricula, political education and, according to some critics, ideological indoctrination and paramilitary training. This requirement was abandoned after the transition to multiparty rule and the organisation was eventually abolished entirely. Some critics of the former René regime also point to corruption and cronyism during his tenure.

<doc id="391056" wikidata="Q307540" url="?curid=391056" title="Abd al-Ilah">
<text>Abd al-Ilah of Hejaz () (; also written Abdul Ilah or Abdullah; 14 November 1913 – 14 July 1958) was a cousin and brother-in-law of King Ghazi of the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq and was regent for his nephew King Faisal II, from 4 April 1939 to 23 May 1953, when Faisal came of age. Abd al-Ilah also held the title of Crown Prince of Iraq from 1943 to 1953.

Abd al-Ilah was killed along with the rest of the Iraqi royal family in the 14 July Revolution in 1958 that ended the Hashemite monarchy in Iraq. His body was mutilated, dragged across the streets of Baghdad, and eventually burnt.

== Biography ==
Son and heir of King Ali ibn Hussein of Hejaz, who was the elder brother of King Faisal I of Iraq, and brother of Aliya bint Ali. His family fled Hejaz when Ibn Saud of Nejd usurped his father&#x27;s authority. Upon King Ghazi&#x27;s death in an automobile accident, Abd al-Ilah assumed power in Iraq as Regent for the under-age King Faisal II.

=== 1941 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état ===
During World War II, Abd al-Ilah was deposed briefly by former Prime Minister Rashid Ali al-Gaylani. Rashid Ali led a pro-German &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against Abd al-Ilah&#x27;s pro-British government. After he fled the country, Abd al-Ilah was replaced as regent by Sharaf bin Rajeh, an ageing, religious relative of Faisal II. Abd al-Ilah, fearing for his life, was taken on a daring escape route that led via the US embassy in Baghdad to the RAF base at Habbaniya, before reaching the safety of the British warship HMS &quot;Cockchafer&quot; and eventually the city of Jerusalem. The deposed regent spent his time with former Prime Minister Nuri al-Said as a refugee in Amman. During his time in exile, Abd al-Ilah was a guest of his uncle Abdullah, the Emir of Transjordan.

On 2 May, the United Kingdom launched an offensive against the Iraqi rebels. On 26 May, &quot;The New York Times&quot; newspaper reported that Abd al-Ilah had called for an uprising of tribal and religious leaders to help him overthrow the insurgent government. He appealed specifically to the Iraqi people, the army and the police to accomplish &quot;this heavy task&quot;.

By 2 June, Rashid Ali&#x27;s &quot;National Defense Government&quot; had collapsed, and Rashid Ali had fled to Iran. Abd al-Ilah returned to Baghdad and was restored as regent.

Working in tandem with Nuri al-Said, Abd al-Ilah pursued a moderate nationalist approach while maintaining close ties to the Allies.

In 1942, Wendell Willkie travelled to Britain and the Middle East as President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s personal representative. In Iraq, Abdul Ilah held a lavish state dinner attended by Willkie.

In 1945, Abd al-Ilah visited the United States. He was the honored guest at the first state dinner hosted by the new American First Lady, Bess Truman. The regent of &quot;friendly Iraq&quot; was awarded a Legion of Merit military decoration by President Harry S. Truman.

In 1953, Crown Prince Abd al-Ilah stepped down when Faisal II came of age. But he continued to be a close adviser of the young King, and an advocate of a pro-Western foreign policy.

In 1955, Iraq adopted the Baghdad Pact (also known as the Central Treaty Organization, or CENTO). The other members of the organization were Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The organization&#x27;s headquarters were initially located in Baghdad.

In May 1957, King Saud of Saudi Arabia made an eight-day visit to Iraq. He was met on his arrival by Faisal II, Abd al-Ilah, and Prime Minister Nuri al-Said. It was the Saudi king&#x27;s first ever visit to Iraq, and it commemorated Iraq&#x27;s membership in the Arab Federation and its break with the United Arab Republic of Gamal Abdel Nasser.

== Death ==

=== 14 July Revolution ===
On 14 July 1958, a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; led by Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim toppled the government and brought an end to the Iraqi monarchy. In the ensuing violence brought on by the coup, Abd al-Ilah was killed, along with most of the royal family, at the Al-Rehab Palace. The body of Crown Prince Abd al-Ilah was trailed on al-Rashid street and was cut into pieces. According to the 21 July edition of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s Middle East News Agency gleefully described the assassination of Crown Prince Abd al-Ilah: &#x27;The people dragged Abd al-Ilah&#x27;s body into the street like that of a dog and tore it limb from limb.&#x27; Then the mobs burned the body, and hung it at the Ministry of Defense gates.

==Private life==
In his book &quot;Closet Queens&quot;, about 20th century British gay politicians, historian and biographer Michael Bloch mentions Prince Abd al-Ilah (whom he calls Prince Abdulilah), on page 157. Bloch describes Prince Abd al-Ilah as being &quot;homosexual&quot; and a close friend of Alan Lennox-Boyd, MP (who was later elevated to the peerage, in 1960, as the 1st Viscount Boyd of Merton). Bloch says that after Abd al-Ilah was killed, &quot;the revolutionaries discovered intimate letters from Lennox-Boyd among the Prince&#x27;s papers, which they released to the world&#x27;s press.&quot;

On page 159 of the book, Bloch says that Lennox-Boyd and Henry Channon organized a memorial service for their friend, the Prince, in 1958.

In the early 1950s he told a Turkish diplomat that he was very fond of the Club rakı, a brand of Turkish rakı.

== Military ranks and awards ==
Abd al-Ilah held the following ranks: 
* Field Marshal, Royal Iraqi Army
* Marshal, Royal Iraqi Air Force
* Honorary Marshal, Royal Air Force

He was awarded the Legion of Merit (Chief Commander) on 1 June 1945.
* Poland (in exile): Order of the White Eagle, 1947.

<text>Jason Paul Allison (born May 29, 1975) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre who played 552 games in the National Hockey League (NHL). Allison was born in North York, Ontario, but grew up in Toronto, Ontario. His most productive seasons were with the Boston Bruins, where he briefly served as team captain. He also played for the Washington Capitals, Los Angeles Kings and Toronto Maple Leafs. A very successful junior hockey player with the London Knights, he won two gold medals as part of the men&#x27;s junior national team in 1994 and 1995 and was the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s 1994 winner of the Red Tilson Trophy as the league&#x27;s most outstanding player. In the NHL, he was top ten in points twice and played in the All-Star Game once. His career was derailed by injuries and a labour dispute. Allison&#x27;s final game was played against the Montreal Canadiens in March 2006 which he was injured. He attempted a comeback in 2009, but ultimately failed.

==Junior hockey==
Allison attended Daystrom Elementary Public School, Humber Summit Middle School and Emery Collegiate Secondary School in the Weston Road and Finch Avenue area of Toronto and Westview Centennial Secondary School in Toronto, Ontario. As a youth, he played in the 1989 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Toronto Red Wings minor ice hockey team.

From 1991 to 1994, Allison played with the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), with his best year coming in 1993–94 when he scored 142 points in 56 games and won the Eddie Power Trophy as the league&#x27;s leading scorer, the OHL&#x27;s Most Gentlemanly Player and the Red Tilson Trophy as the league&#x27;s most outstanding player. Allison was drafted 17th overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft by the Washington Capitals as a result. He played for the men&#x27;s junior national team in both the 1994 and 1995 championships winning gold medals both times. 

==NHL career==
In 1994, Allison signed a four-year entry-level contract with the Capitals with an additional option year. He struggled to break into the Capitals lineup and was demoted to team&#x27;s American Hockey League affiliate, the Portland Pirates. In 1996, the Capitals sent him on a course to improve his skating. He never met the Capitals&#x27; expectations and on March 1, 1997, was part of a major trade with the Boston Bruins. Allison, Anson Carter, Jim Carey, a 1997 third-round draft choice and a conditional 1998 second-round draft choice were traded to the Bruins for Adam Oates, Rick Tocchet and Bill Ranford. Oates, one of the NHL&#x27;s superstars, had requested a trade if the Bruins did not commit to getting more talent. Allison saw a resurgence with the Bruins, putting up a then career-high 83 points in the 1997–98 season, the ninth highest total in the league. Allison led the Bruins in points three times (1997–98, 1998–99 and 2000–01). In the 2000–01 season, Allison was named captain of the team, the first since the departure of Ray Bourque. His 2000–01 season was his best when he had a career-high 95 points, good for fifth in the league. He also played in the 2001 All-Star Game. However, Allison&#x27;s time with the Bruins came to an abrupt end when contract negotiations following the 2001 year reached an impasse. The Bruins traded Allison, now a fan favourite in Boston, to the Los Angeles Kings with Mikko Eloranta for Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray on October 25, 2001. Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, Allison signed a three-year $20-million contract. 

Allison joined the Kings, filling the need for a number one center who could play with Žigmund Pálffy. However, Allison suffered a stream of injuries, including major ones to the knee and neck and one of many Kings players that suffered a concussion. He missed most of the 2002–03 season and all of the following season. The 2004–05 season was cancelled by a labour dispute and Allison did not receive a qualifying offer from the Kings in 2004 allowing him to become an unrestricted free agent. Prior to the 2005–06 season, Allison signed a one-year contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs worth $1.5 million, with bonus incentives for good performance. Allison suffered a hand injury in a game against the Montreal Canadiens, and had to have surgery on his hand, which sidelined him for the remainder of the season. In the 66 games he played in before the injury, he scored 17 goals and had 60 points for the Maple Leafs.

After the 2005–06 season, Allison became an unrestricted free agent. Toronto chose not to re-sign Allison because GM John Ferguson, Jr. did not feel his skating was good enough. Allison subsequently did not sign with a team for the 2006–07 NHL season, as he wanted to be near his family and no situation arose where he could.

===2009 attempted comeback===
On August 28, 2009, Allison received an invitation to the Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; September 2009 training camp, and trained with them through the beginning of the preseason. Allison had not played professionally since 2005–06; in explaining the invitation, Brian Burke, the general manager of the Maple Leafs, said: &quot;He had some personal issues and some major physical issues at that time. He has solved all of those. In my mind, he is a guy who might give us a lift and he deserves that opportunity.&quot;

In an interview after his first exhibition game back, Allison was as confident as ever. &quot;I didn&#x27;t contribute much, but that&#x27;s to be expected, I&#x27;m just shaking the cobwebs off. I fully anticipate regaining my previous form as a point-per-game player.&quot;

Allison&#x27;s bid to make the team on a tryout ended up falling short. The training camp invite yielded a memorable moment, when Allison fought with the Philadelphia Flyers&#x27; Darroll Powe during an exhibition game and ripped his helmet in half with his bare hands. It was not enough, however, and by September 28, Maple Leafs head coach Ron Wilson confessed that Allison was &quot;out of the plans.&quot;

==Personal life==
In retirement Allison operated a horse farm north of Toronto. He bought Reef Island on Lake Joseph in Ontario in 2004. &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;Deadline&quot; in 2018 reported that Allison and his company Don Kee Productions were one of fourteen executive producers on the film &quot;Arkansas&quot;.

<text>Thorismund (also Thorismod or Thorismud, as manuscripts of the chief source confusingly attest) ( 420–453), became king of the Visigoths after his father Theodoric I was killed in the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (also called Battle of Châlons) in 451 CE. He was murdered in 453 and was succeeded by his brother Theodoric II.

==Biography==
Thorismund appears to have played a pivotal role in the Battle of Châlons as he led a contingent of the Visigoth forces in capturing an important summit at the very early stages of the conflict. The summit seems to have extended to the whole of the left flank of the Ostrogoth and Hun forces. Thorismund descended from the hills during the late stages of the conflict, when the Huns had prevailed over the Alans, and the Ostrogoths were pushing the disorganized Visigoths after the death of their king Theodoric. Thorismund led his force of Visigoths in a decisive charge which, according to Edward Gibbon, flanked both the Ostrogoths and subsequently the Huns and snatched the victory from his enemies.

==Early life and education==
Peterson was born in Oakland, Nebraska, the son of Henry C. Peterson and Hermanda (Swanberg) Peterson. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Wayne State Teachers College and a Master of Arts degree in political science from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Following 1933, Peterson maintained his permanent residence in Elgin, Nebraska.

==Career==
Peterson worked as a teacher, school administrator, and newspaper man. He was the Elgin superintendent of schools and was the publisher of &quot;The Elgin Review&quot; for ten years. During World War II he served as lieutenant colonel in the United States Army Air Forces.

Peterson first entered politics as the campaign manager for the Hugh Butler 1940 U.S. senatorial bid. He also was the administrative assistant and secretary to Governor Dwight Griswold from 1941 to 1942. Peterson next secured the Republican gubernatorial nomination, and was elected governor in November 1946. He was reelected to a second term in 1948, and to a third term in 1950.

During his tenure, the Missouri River basin development was endorsed and highway revenue initiatives were sought. Also during Peterson&#x27;s term, he chaired the State Governors Conference and presided over the Council of State Governments in 1952. In December 1951, Governor Peterson appointed Fred Andrew Seaton to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Kenneth S. Wherry.

Peterson served in the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration as director of the Federal Civil Defense Administration from 1953 to 1957. As Federal Civil Defense Administrator, Peterson is reputed to have speculated about the possibility of creating a cobalt doomsday bomb. Peterson served as U.S. ambassador to Denmark, from 1957 to 1961 and U.S. ambassador to Finland, from 1969 to 1973.

== Death ==
Peterson died October 17, 1983, in Fremont, Nebraska, reportedly of respiratory failure following a struggle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He is interred at Oakdale Cemetery, Oakdale, Nebraska.

==Legacy==
The Peterson Fine Arts building at his alma mater, Wayne State College, was named in his honor. A variety of autographed photographs representing his political career (particularly a full Eisenhower Cabinet photo with autographs of each member, as well as a personally inscribed color photograph of Richard Nixon) were on display for many years at the Wayne State library. However, the photos began to deteriorate due to exposure, and had to be removed; they are still in the possession of the college.

<text>Anthony Lewis Amonte (born August 2, 1970) is an American former professional ice hockey player. He played right wing over 17 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Rangers, Chicago Blackhawks, Phoenix Coyotes, Philadelphia Flyers and the Calgary Flames. He previously served as the head coach of the Thayer Academy men&#x27;s varsity hockey team. He is currently a scout with the Florida Panthers.

==Playing career==

Drafted 68th overall in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Rangers, Amonte is best known for his time as a scoring star with the Chicago Blackhawks and for representing the United States in international play. Amonte made his debut in the 1991 playoffs. He impressed as a rookie, scoring over 30 goals and placing third in the balloting for the Calder Memorial Trophy. He played three seasons with the Rangers, scoring 84 goals, before being traded to the Chicago Blackhawks with seven games to go in the 1993–94 season, the year the Rangers went on to win the Stanley Cup. He gained stardom in Chicago where he was initially reunited with former Thayer Academy teammate Jeremy Roenick, scoring at least 30 goals six times and at least 40 three times, including having a five-season-long streak in which he did not miss a single game.

Amonte, playing for Team USA, won the gold medal in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey tournament. Amonte scored the game-winning goal with just two and a half minutes left in the final against Team Canada.

He began the 2002–03 season with the Phoenix Coyotes and was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers near the end of the season. Amonte signed with the Calgary Flames as a free agent on August 2, 2005, and scored his 400th NHL goal for the Flames on December 10, 2005, against the Ottawa Senators.

As of March 2020, he is ranked 13th all-time in points among American-born players, with 900.

He announced his retirement via his personal website in 2008.

<doc id="391079" wikidata="Q2903817" url="?curid=391079" title="Royal Mews">
<text>The Royal Mews is a mews, or collection of equestrian stables, of the British royal family. In London these stables and stable-hands&#x27; quarters have occupied two main sites in turn, being located at first on the north side of Charing Cross, and then (since the 1820s) within the grounds of Buckingham Palace.

The Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace, includes an extensive display of royal carriages and other associated items, and is open to the public for much of the year. It is also a working part of the palace, where horses and people live and work, and where carriages and cars are in daily use supporting the work of the monarch as head of state.

The titular head of the Royal Mews is the Master of the Horse (one of the three great officers of the Royal Household). The executive head is the Crown Equerry, who lives on site and oversees the Royal Mews Department (which is a department of the Royal Household).

==History==
===At Charing Cross===

The first set of stables to be referred to as a mews was at Charing Cross at the western end of The Strand. The royal hawks were kept at this site from 1377 and the name originates from the fact that they were confined there at moulting time (&quot;mew&quot; being derived from the French verb &quot;muer&quot;, to moult).

In the Tudor Period, the Royal Stables were located in Lomesbury (present-day Bloomsbury). In 1534 they were destroyed by fire, whereupon the King, Henry VIII, decided to rebuild the Charing Cross mews as a stables (the hawks having been given alternative accommodation). It kept its former name when it acquired this new function. On old maps, such as the &quot;Woodcut&quot; map of London of the early 1560s, the Mews can be seen extending back towards the site of today&#x27;s Leicester Square.

When George I came to the throne in 1714 he brought with him to London the famous cream stallions which he was wont to use as Elector of Hanover. Bred at the Royal Stud at Hampton Court, these horses pulled state carriages in England for the next two hundred years (except for a hiatus during the Napoleonic wars when George III used black stallions in protest at the French occupation of Hanover).
The mews was rebuilt again in 1732 to the designs of William Kent, and in the early 19th century it was open to the public. This building was usually known as the King&#x27;s Mews (or Queen&#x27;s Mews when there was a woman on the throne), but was also sometimes referred to as the Royal Mews or the Royal Stables.
Kent&#x27;s redesign was a classical building occupying the northern half of the site, with an open space in front of it that ranked among the few large ones in central London at a time when the Royal Parks were on the fringes of the city and most squares in London were garden squares open only to the residents of their surrounding houses.

On 15 June 1820, the Guards in the Royal Mews mutinied in support of Caroline of Brunswick, whom King George IV was seeking to divorce.

The whole site was cleared in the late 1820s to create Trafalgar Square, laid out in 1837–1844 after delays, and the National Gallery which opened in 1838.
===At Buckingham Palace===

The present Royal Mews is in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, to the south of Buckingham Palace Gardens, near Grosvenor Place.

In the 1760s George III moved some of his day-to-day horses and carriages to the grounds of Buckingham House, which he had acquired in 1762 for his wife&#x27;s use. The Riding School, thought to be by William Chambers, dates from this period (it was completed in 1764; the pediment, with sculptural motifs by William Theed, was added in 1859). The main royal stables housing the ceremonial coaches and their horses remained at the King&#x27;s Mews, Charing Cross; however, when his son George IV had Buckingham Palace converted into the main royal residence in the 1820s the whole stables establishment was moved there.
The current Royal Mews was built to designs by John Nash and was completed in 1825 (though the mews buildings have been modified extensively since). The main quadrangle was laid out with coach houses on the east side, and stable blocks (alternating with harness and forage rooms) on the west. Beyond it, the &#x27;back mews&#x27; included accommodation for a veterinary surgeon.
When Victoria came to the throne in 1837, Buckingham Palace became the monarch&#x27;s principal residence. Prince Albert used the back mews for stabling his own horses (for riding and driving). By the 1850s there were just under two hundred people employed at the mews, most of whom lived on site with their families. Standing either side of the entrance were official residences (one for the Crown Equerry, the other for the Clerk of the Stables); other staff were accommodated in rooms above the stables and carriage houses. In 1855 Queen Victoria established a Buckingham Palace Royal Mews School, for the education of the workers&#x27; children.
Under Victoria&#x27;s successor, King Edward VII, motor vehicles were introduced into the mews. In 1904 the Crown Equerry wrote to the Office of Works to request the conversion of &#x27;two small coach-houses in the Back Mews&#x27; into &#x27;a suitable Motor House [...] with a Lantern roof, hot water heating apparatus and electric lighting&#x27;. The conversion duly took place, and accommodation was provided nearby for the chauffeurs.
In the early 20th century problems had arisen due to inbreeding of the Hanoverian creams. In 1920 they were withdrawn from use and in their place, for the rest of the decade, bay horses took pride of place in the Mews. In the early 1930s, however, King George V began using grey horses for the lead carriages in state and ceremonial processions; his son and heir Edward VIII moved the grey horses from Windsor (where they had been used for many years by the Royal Family for their private carriages) to London, where they were nicknamed the &#x27;Windsor Greys&#x27;.

By 1936 motor vehicles were in the ascendency, and following his accession to the throne Edward VIII disposed of several of the more &#x27;day to day&#x27; carriages. George VI made more disposals after the Second World War: for example, sixteen plain Edwardian town coaches were sold off at this time (just one remained, stored away at Windsor; it was later rediscovered, glazed and restored to royal use). A total of nineteen carriages were purchased by Sir Alexander Korda after the war, for use as film props; of these, five Clarences were borrowed back in 1953 for the coronation (to supplement five identical carriages which had been retained by the Mews). The coronation that year involved thirty-four coaches and carriages with seventy-eight horses in harness.

In 1988 a new state coach was presented to the Mews, the Australian State Coach, built by former Mews employee W. J. Frecklington as part of the Australian Bicentenary celebrations; it was the first new royal state coach to be built since the 1902 State Landau. At that time, despite the earlier disposals, the Royal Mews still had custody of over a hundred vehicles, with all but a dozen being in working order; the majority were in London or Windsor, with others spread around the other royal residences.

==Present day==

As well as being a full-time working facility, the Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace, is regularly open to the public. The state coaches and other carriages are kept there, along with about 30 horses, together with their modern counterparts: the state motor cars. Coachmen, grooms, chauffeurs and other staff are accommodated in flats above the carriage houses and stables.

===Carriage horses===
The complement of horses in the Royal Mews today includes around a dozen Windsor Greys and eighteen Cleveland Bays. The horses are regularly exercised in the art of pulling carriages (which is one of the reasons for the continuing use of horse-drawn transport for the daily messenger rounds between Buckingham Palace and St James&#x27;s Palace); they are used for competitive and recreational driving as well as for ceremonial duties. The manure that is produced by the horses is used by the adjacent Buckingham Palace Garden.

===Royal and state carriages===
A few of the carriages stored at the Mews are pictured here in action; several more are illustrated on their own pages (see listing below).
Vehicles in the care of the Royal Mews are listed below. A good number are on public display, though not all are kept in London. Most are in regular use, and some (for example, the broughams) are driven on a daily basis. Others (above all the Gold Coach) are only used on great and rare state occasions. The list includes vehicles for personal, recreational and sporting use, as well as those designed and kept for state occasions:

* The Gold State Coach
* The Irish State Coach
* The Scottish State Coach
* The Australian State Coach
* The Diamond Jubilee State Coach
* Queen Alexandra&#x27;s State Coach
* The Glass Coach
* King Edward VII&#x27;s Town Coach
* Several landau carriages including:
** The 1902 State Landau
** Seven other state landaus
** Five semi-state landaus
** Five Ascot landaus
* Barouches and sociables
* Broughams and clarences
* Phaetons and victorias
* Sporting carriages, including a rare curricle
* Recreational vehicles, such as the Louis-Philippe charabanc (illustrated)
* A variety of pony carriages, drags and exercise vehicles

In less regular use is Queen Victoria&#x27;s state sledge, one of a number of royal sleighs in the Mews.

Also on display are some of the historic and immaculately kept liveries and harnesses (which likewise see regular use), ranging from the plainer items used for exercising and working horses, to the ornamented state liveries and harnesses designed for use with the similarly appointed state coaches.

===Motor vehicles===
The maintenance and provision of modern motor vehicles is as much a part of the work of the Royal Mews as that of carriages and horses. Edward VII first established a garage in the Mews in the early years of the twentieth century.

The principal official cars are all painted in black over claret (known as Royal Claret). They are driven, cared for and maintained by a number of chauffeurs, who are based in the Mews and work under the head chauffeur (who, along with his deputy, is primarily responsible for driving the monarch).

====State cars====

The five principal state cars are without number plates. They comprise:
* Two identical Bentley State Limousines (one was given to Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 to mark her Golden Jubilee, the other was purchased at the same time).
* Two Rolls-Royce Phantom VI limousines: the 1978 Silver Jubilee Phantom VI and a 1986 Phantom VI, both nearly identical outwardly, save for the slightly higher roof on the 1978 example (see photo).
* A rare 1950 Rolls-Royce Phantom IV with body by HJ Mulliner &amp; Co., the first example of this model built; it was fitted with an automatic gearbox in 1955.

====Other official vehicles====
The following vehicles, used for less-formal occasions and as support vehicles, are similarly painted in the royal claret and black livery:
* Three Daimler DS420 limousines, two dating from 1992 (number plates KLL1 and K326EHV) and one from 1988 (F728OUL).
* Two 2012 Jaguar XJ limousines (number plates NGN 1 and NGN 2).
* Three 2022 Range Rovers (number plates MYT1, MYT 2 and MYT 3).
* The State Hearse commissioned for the funeral of Elizabeth II.

Land Rovers, luggage brakes and people carriers are also kept at the Royal Mews. A number of electric vehicles have been acquired since 2012, for various purposes, ranging from a BMW i3 and a BMW 7 Series hybrid to a Nissan van and a Renault Twizy.

===The Royal Mews Department===
The following chart shows the staff structure of the Royal Mews Department at the end of the twentieth century (when around fifty people lived and worked at the Mews). The position of Superintendent, which included oversight of the staff of the Mews, was abolished in 2000.







==Other locations==

The Royal Mews, Hampton Court Palace overlooks Hampton Court Green. It continues to provide accommodation for royal staff, and horses are stabled there from time to time. It is not open to the public.

There is a working Royal Mews at Windsor Castle where the Ascot carriages are normally kept, together with vehicles used in Windsor Great Park. Some horses for riding (rather than driving) are also stabled here.

At Holyrood, the Royal Mews (situated in Abbey Strand) is one of the oldest parts of the Palace, and is still pressed into service whenever royal carriages are used in Edinburgh.

Historically, the old stables of St James&#x27;s Palace, which stood where Lancaster House is now, were also sometime referred to as the Royal Mews.

<text>Theodoric II ( 426 – early 466) was the eighth King of the Visigoths, from 453 to 466.

==Biography==
Theoderic II, son of Theodoric I, obtained the throne by killing his elder brother Thorismund. The English historian Edward Gibbon writes that &quot;he justified this atrocious deed by the design which his predecessor had formed of violating his alliance with the empire.&quot; In late 458 the Western Roman Emperor, Majorian entered Septimania to attack Theodoric and reclaim the province for the empire. Majorian defeated Theodoric at the Battle of Arelate, forcing the Visigoths to abandon Septimania and withdraw west to Aquitania. Under the new treaty with the Romans, the Visigoths had to relinquish their recent conquests in Hispania and return to federate status. However, after the assassination of Majorian in 461, Theodoric recaptured Septimania and invaded Hispania again. Theodoric sided with Ricimer and the new emperor Libius Severus against Majorian&#x27;s magister militum per Gallias Aegidius. Theodorics&#x27; army was defeated by Aegidius at Aurelianum and his brother Frederic died in battle, which Kulikowski writes &quot;would have important consequences for the Gothic succession.&quot; Theodoric was himself murdered in 466 by his younger brother Euric, who succeeded him to the throne.

<doc id="391081" wikidata="Q831597" url="?curid=391081" title="Gray catbird">
<text>The gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), also spelled grey catbird, is a medium-sized North American and Central American perching bird of the mimid family. It is the only member of the &quot;catbird&quot; genus Dumetella. Like the black catbird (&quot;Melanoptila glabrirostris&quot;), it is among the basal lineages of the Mimidae, probably a closer relative of the Caribbean thrasher and trembler assemblage than of the mockingbirds and &quot;Toxostoma&quot; thrashers. In some areas it is known as the slate-colored mockingbird.

==Taxonomy==
The name &quot;Dumetella&quot; is based upon the Latin term &quot;dūmus&quot; (&quot;thorny thicket&quot;); it thus means approximately &quot;small thornbush-dweller&quot; or &quot;small bird of the thornbushes&quot;. It refers to the species&#x27; habit of singing when hidden in undergrowth. The specific name &quot;carolinensis&quot; is Neo-Latin for &quot;from the Carolinas&quot;.

The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1766 edition of &quot;Systema naturae&quot;. His original name &quot;Muscicapa carolinensis&quot; reflected the belief, widespread at that time, that the gray catbird was some sort of Old World flycatcher (presumably due to its remarkably plain coloration, not similar to other mimids).

The genus name has a convoluted nomenclatorial history. The monotypic genus &quot;Galeoscoptes&quot;, proposed by Jean Cabanis in 1850, was widely used up to 1907. This name roughly means &quot;capped mockingbird&quot;, from Latin &quot;galea&quot; &quot;helmet&quot; and Ancient Greek &quot;skóptein&quot; (σκώπτειν, &quot;to scold&quot; or &quot;to mock&quot;). But as it turned out, &quot;Dumetella&quot; was a technically acceptable senior synonym, even though the peculiar circumstances of its publishing left the identity of its author unsolved until 1989. As it turned out, the genus name was published by C.T. Wood in 1837. His description is somewhat eccentric, and was published under his pseudonym &quot;S.D.W.&quot;. Wood misquotes his source—John Latham&#x27;s 1783 &quot;General Synopsis of Birds&quot;—as calling the bird &quot;cat thrush&quot;, probably because he knew the species under that name from George Shaw&#x27;s &quot;General Zoology&quot;. Latham&#x27;s name was &quot;cat flycatcher&quot;, analogous to the scientific name of Linné.

Shaw (and subsequently C.T. Wood) used Louis Pierre Vieillot&#x27;s specific name &quot;felivox&quot;. This means &quot;cat voice&quot;, a contraction of Latin &quot;felis&quot; (&quot;cat&quot;) and &quot;vox&quot; (&quot;voice&quot;). Vieillot, differing from the earlier authors, believed the bird to be a true thrush (&quot;Turdus&quot;).

Though mimids were widely considered Turdidae until the 1850s, this was not any more correct than treating them as Old World flycatchers, as these three families are distinct lineages of the superfamily Muscicapoidea. In the mid-20th century, the Turdidae and even most of the Sylvioidea were lumped in the Muscicapidae—but the Mimidae were not.

Lastly, the smaller gray catbirds from Bermuda, which have proportionally narrow and shorter rectrices and primary remiges, were described as subspecies &quot;bermudianus&quot; (&quot;from Bermuda&quot;) by Outram Bangs in 1901. But this taxon was never widely accepted, and today the gray catbird is generally considered monotypic as a species, too.

==Description==
Adults weigh from , with an average of They range in length from and span across the wings. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the culmen is and the tarsus is . Gray catbirds are plain lead gray almost all over. The top of the head is darker. The undertail coverts are rust-colored, and the remiges and rectrices are black, some with white borders. The slim bill, the eyes, and the legs and feet are also blackish. Males and females cannot be distinguished by their looks; different behaviours in the breeding season is usually the only clue to the observer. Juveniles are even plainer in coloration, with buffy undertail coverts.

===Vocalizations===
This species is named for its cat-like call. Like many members of the Mimidae (in particular mockingbirds), it also mimics the songs of other birds, as well as those of Hylidae (tree frogs), and even mechanical sounds. Because of its well-developed songbird syrinx, it is able to make two sounds at the same time. The alarm call resembles the quiet calls of a male mallard.

A gray catbird&#x27;s song is easily distinguished from that of the northern mockingbird (&quot;Mimus polyglottos&quot;) or brown thrasher (&quot;Toxostoma rufum&quot;) because the mockingbird repeats its phrases or &quot;strophes&quot; three to four times, the thrasher usually twice, but the catbird sings most phrases only once. The catbird&#x27;s song is usually described as more raspy and less musical than that of a mockingbird.

In contrast to the many songbirds that choose a prominent perch from which to sing, the catbird often elects to sing from inside a bush or small tree, where it is obscured from view by the foliage.

==Distribution and habitat==

Native to most of temperate North America east of the Rocky Mountains, gray catbirds migrate to the southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean in winter; except for the occasional vagrant they always stay east of the American Cordillera. They are extremely rare vagrants to western Europe. Normally present on the breeding grounds by May, most leave for winter quarters in September/October; as it seems, this species is increasingly extending its stay in the summer range, with some nowadays remaining until mid-winter as far north as Ohio. The gray catbird is a migratory species. Spring migration ranges from March to May, and in the fall ranges from late August to November.

The catbird tends to avoid dense, unbroken woodlands, and does not inhabit coniferous, pine woodland. Catbirds prefer a dense vegetative substrate, especially if thorny vegetation is present. Scrublands, woodland edges, overgrown farmland and abandoned orchards are generally among the preferred locations of the catbird. In Bermuda, its preferred habitats are scrub and myrtle swamp. During the winter season, the catbird has an affinity for berry-rich thickets, especially within proximity of water sources.

==Behavior==
===Breeding===
Their breeding habitat is semi-open areas with dense, low growth; they are also found in urban, suburban, and rural habitats. In the winter months they seem to associate with humans even more. These birds mainly forage on the ground in leaf litter, but also in shrubs and trees. They mainly eat arthropods and berries. In the winter months, &quot;Cymbopetalum mayanum&quot; (Annonaceae) and &quot;Trophis racemosa&quot; (Moraceae) bear fruit well liked by this species, and such trees can be planted to attract the gray catbird into parks and gardens.

They build a bulky cup nest in a shrub or tree, close to the ground. Eggs are light blue in color, and clutch size ranges from 1–5, with 2–3 eggs most common. Both parents take turns feeding the young birds.

===Feeding===
Gray catbirds are omnivores, and approximately 50% of their diet is fruit and berries. They tend to peck more fruit than they can eat. They also eat mealworms, earthworms, beetles, and other bugs. In summer, gray catbirds will eat mostly ants, beetles, grasshoppers, caterpillars, and moths. They also eat holly berries, cherries, elderberries, poison ivy, bay, and blackberries. They also often peck the eggs of other species of birds, but it is unknown if they do this to supplement their diet or to reduce competition for food from other birds.

==Predation and threats==
The gray catbird can be attracted by &quot;pishing&quot; sounds. Gray catbirds are not afraid of predators and respond to them aggressively by flashing their wings and tails and by making their signature mew sounds. They are also known to even attack and peck predators that come too near their nests. They also will destroy eggs of the brood parasitic brown-headed cowbird (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;) laid in their nests by pecking them.

This species is widespread and generally plentiful, though its reclusive habits often make it seem less common than it is. It is not considered threatened by the IUCN due to its large range and numbers.

On Bermuda however, gray catbirds were once very common, but their numbers have been greatly reduced in recent years by deforestation and nest predation by introduced species (including the great kiskadee &quot;Pitangus sulphuratus&quot; and the European starling &quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;). In the United States, this species receives special legal protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

<text>Psychic TV (aka PTV or Psychick TV or several other aliases) were an English experimental video art and music collective, formed by performance artist Genesis P-Orridge and Scottish musician Alex Fergusson in 1981 after the break-up of Throbbing Gristle. They have released over one hundred full-length albums to date.

Contributors include artists such as Coil, Current 93, Monte Cazazza, Larry Thrasher, Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, Soft Cell, Fred Giannelli, Hafler Trio, The Cult, Master Musicians of Jajouka, William Breeze, Derek Jarman, John Gosling, Timothy Leary, Rose McDowall, Andrew Weatherall, and Z&#x27;EV. Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (a.k.a. T.O.P.Y.) formed as an organisation at the inception of the band, who conceived it as a magical order and the philosophical wing of Psychic TV. T.O.P.Y. functions as a cult-like fan-club for the group. 

Psychic TV was influential in pioneering the acid house genre, releasing several fake compilations in an effort to popularize the sound, such as &quot;Jack the Tab&quot; and &quot;Tekno Acid Beat&quot;. According to some, acid house was given its name by Genesis Breyer P-Orridge. After breaking up in 1999, they reformed as PTV3 with a new line-up in 2003, but disbanded in 2020 when their core member Genesis Breyer P-Orridge died.

== History ==
Since Genesis P-Orridge primarily wrote the lyrics instead of the music for Psychic TV, they would assemble different groups of musicians together to create the music. The history of Psychic TV can be broken up into the periods of the main songwriter that was working with them at the time.

=== 1981–87: Alex Fergusson period ===
Psychic TV was formed with the core membership of Genesis P-Orridge (ex-Throbbing Gristle) and Alex Fergusson in 1981. Alex Fergusson was a member of the punk/experimental outfit Alternative TV, with whom P-Orridge performed at one point throughout Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s run. Similarities can be seen in the artwork for Alternative TV and early Psychic TV releases, with a recurring pastiche on the &#x27;as seen on TV&#x27; marketing style. Fellow ex-TG member Peter Christopherson got involved in 1982 and claimed that the &#x27;TV&#x27; component of the name was intended to focus on the visual elements of the outfit. P-Orridge once claimed that &quot;Psychic TV is a video group who does music unlike a music group which makes music videos&quot;.

Psychic TV made their live debut in Autumn 1982 as a part of the &quot;Final Academy&quot;, a multi-performance event dedicated to and featuring William S. Burroughs. In November 1982, Psychic TV&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Force the Hand of Chance&quot;, was released by Some Bizzare Records and distributed by WEA International; its accompanying single, &quot;Just Drifting&quot;, came out in the same year&#x27;s December. &quot;Dreams Less Sweet&quot;, a follow-up to &quot;Force...&quot; was released in 1983. Lyrics were handled by P-Orridge while the music was written by Fergusson and sound experiments by Christopherson and John Balance – foreshadowing the pair&#x27;s later work as Coil. Marc Almond of Soft Cell also contributed vocals.

The live shows, such as those at the Berlin Atonal festival, continued to include improvised noise elements until Peter Christopherson left and Fergusson brought in new musicians. In 1986, Psychic TV began a series of 23 live show performances being recorded and released, each from a different nation, on the 23rd of each month for 23 months, earning an entry in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for most records released in one year (1986).&gt; though the series was discontinued after 17 albums, it earned the band an entry in &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. Towards the end of this period Fergusson/P-Orridge completed their third proper studio album, &quot;Allegory and Self&quot; (1988, though recorded in 1986). It was at this point that P-Orridge became interested in the burgeoning acid house and techno movements. Alex Fergusson left in early 1987 due to disagreements with band management and was replaced by techno artist Fred Giannelli.

=== 1988–92: Fred Giannelli period ===
During this period Fred Giannelli, Dave Ball from Soft Cell, Richard Norris (who later formed the Grid with Dave Ball), John Gosling, engineer Richard Evans and other techno artists released music not only as Psychic TV but also under a variety of fake names. The idea behind this was to release fake &quot;compilations&quot; by imaginary artists, creating a sense that a healthy acid house scene existed in the UK. The key studio albums of this period were &quot;Jack the Tab – Acid Tablets Volume One&quot; (1988), &quot;Tekno Acid Beat&quot; (1988), &quot;Towards Thee Infinite Beat&quot; (1990; credited to Psychic TV) and &quot;Beyond Thee Infinite Beat&quot; (1992; credited to Psychic TV; 12&quot; remixes of &quot;Towards&quot; tracks which could be played at 33 or 45 rpm). Almost all of the live shows in this period were based around the songs on these albums. From &#x27;88–&#x27;90 PTV was very stable as a live unit and did more gigs and touring than any other version of PTV before or after. They embarked on a long tour of the US and UK in 1988, Europe in 1989 and another long tour of the United States in 1990.

In 1990, Psychic TV released the song &quot;I.C. Water&quot; from the album &quot;Towards Thee Infinite Beat&quot; as a 7&quot; and 12&quot; single on the 10-year anniversary of the death of Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis. The sleeve was a hand drawn image of Ian Curtis derived from a famous photograph.

In the early 1990s, Vice-President of Elektra Records, Howard Thompson took an interest in signing Psychic TV. He explained that he was going to take a one-year sabbatical from the music industry and he had been asked to run a major independent record label and he wanted to sign Psychic TV to that label. The label was in fact, Herb Alpert&#x27;s and Jerry Moss&#x27;s new imprint Almo Sounds, after the sale of A &amp; M Records. Studio time was booked and Genesis P-Orridge, Fred Giannelli and Matthew Best went into Brilliant Studios in San Francisco to record demos. Four tracks were recorded and rough mixes delivered and were rejected by Almo Sounds. The songs were entitled: &quot;Snowflake&quot;, &quot;Intoxication&quot;, &quot;E-Lusive&quot; and &quot;Avatar&quot;. During this period, the band famously performed at Mr Floppy&#x27;s Flophouse events in Oakland.

=== 1992–93: exile ===
In 1992, a video apparently created by Psychic TV was falsely presented as evidence of Satanic ritual abuse in an edition of Channel 4 TV&#x27;s &quot;Dispatches&quot;. As a result, P-Orridge claimed initially that they were deported, although later admitted that they decided not to return to England from Kathmandu, where they and their family had been on holiday after selling an Austin Osman Spare painting to Chris Stein from Blondie for US$10,000 which financed the trip. They also spent some time with Tibetan refugees, and instead of returning to the UK chose to go into &quot;self-imposed exile&quot;. The programme was later discredited, though not before their house was raided by the police and the allegations had been repeated in the tabloid press. They said that they felt they would not get a fair hearing if they returned to England, so the family moved to California.

Shortly after moving to the US, P-Orridge underwent a divorce which traumatised them immensely. Most of the output during this period was made up of re-releases of earlier albums, especially by industrial music record labels who released the albums as a &quot;paying of respects&quot; to the founder of industrial music.

=== 1993–1999: Larry Thrasher period ===
In 1992 Kim Cascone, founder of Silent Records, introduced P-Orridge to Larry Thrasher, co-founder of the mid 80&#x27;s American experimental noise band Thessalonians. This began a new period with Psychic TV returning to its psychedelic pop roots with Thrasher co-producing and co-writing the critically acclaimed &quot;Trip/Reset&quot; as well as the album &quot;Cold Blue Torch&quot; and new experimental explorations which centred around the spoken word poetry of P-orridge in releases like &quot;Thee Fractured Garden&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot;. &quot;Thee Fractured Garden&quot; was a seminal example of this period where Psychic TV blended ambient music, samples and sound collages with spoken word. This eventually led P-Orridge and Thrasher to the create several offshoot groups Splinter Test and later Thee Majesty, which focused on the spoken word and sonic experiments.

Other notable releases upon which P-Orridge collaborated with Thrasher were the Electric Newspapers, a series of open source sample releases that blurred the sampling CD concept with a stream of consciousness listening experience. Material from the Electric Newspaper series of releases (there are six in total, but only four have been released) is mostly taken from the CDs PTV released with Thrasher along with contributors such as Skinny Puppy and other notable musical allies of this time. The original motivation for the Electric Newspaper series was to ensure that the PTV sample files were archived after the loss of the entire PTV sampling library in the dramatic five alarm fire at the Houdini Mansion on Laurel Canyon in Hollywood. This fire, which burned down the mansion, left P-Orridge in the intensive care unit at Cedar Sinai hospital with life-threatening injuries after they (along with members of the band Love and Rockets) jumped from their bedroom windows to escape the flames. Results of this event sent P-Orridge on a two-year health sabbatical to recover, during which they were involved in a million dollar lawsuit against Rick Rubin, who owned the Houdini Mansion. P-Orridge won the case, but was left with a metal plate and eight screws in their permanently disabled and reconstructed arm.

In 1998 P-Orridge announced that they primarily wanted to move into spoken word, which is when Campagna left the band to pursue his own projects, and turned to focus on Thee Majesty with musical line-up of Larry Thrasher and Bryin Dall.

In 2005, the Voiceprint record label in England re-released several older Psychic TV and Genesis P-Orridge albums under the name Thee Majesty, and also a new album recorded with the band Cotton Ferox. Also, a 2005 release, &quot;Mary Never Wanted Jesus&quot;, credited to Genesis P-Orridge &amp; Thee Majesty featured archive PTV material alongside new Thee Majesty recordings. PTV, as a rock entity, had a &quot;final show&quot; in 1999 at The Royal Festival Hall in London. This show also marked the end of P-Orridge&#x27;s exile from the UK.

=== 2003–2020: reformation, PTV3/Edley ODowd period ===

With encouragement from drummer Edley ODowd of Toilet Böys, Genesis reformed Psychic TV with an all new line-up, returning to the stage in 2003 with a concert in New York under the guise of PTV3, with a lineup including Edley ODowd, Alice Genese (bass), Douglas Rushkoff (keyboards) and Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge (sampler). The concert featured video projections by Sam Zimmerman (Crash Worship). In September 2004, an extensive tour of Europe (covering sixteen countries) and North America was launched. 2005 saw the band return to the studio, recording their first album in over ten years (P-Orridge also spent 2005 working with Throbbing Gristle on their first album in over twenty-five years). Additionally, a few more dates were performed in Europe throughout the year.

In January 2006, a new PTV album was announced by P-Orridge on their website entitled &quot;Hell Is Invisible... Heaven Is Her/e&quot;. The album was recorded in New York and features Nick Zinner (Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and Gibby Haynes (Butthole Surfers) guesting on some tracks. P-Orridge described it as &quot;&quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; for the 21st century&quot;.

Concerts in 2006 included Sheffield, Birmingham and London, UK, as well as Brussels, Amsterdam and Moscow. The 2006 line up consisted of Genesis Breyer P-Orridge (vocals, &quot;noise bass&quot;), Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge (samples), Edley ODowd (drums), Alice Genese (bass), David Max (guitar), Markus Aurelius Cirkus Maximus Dangerous Fabulous Persson (keyboards) and Zef Noi$e (electric violin). The 2006 shows included an &#x27;all new video light show&#x27; by Sterile Cowboys &amp; Co. (a.k.a. Nicolas Jenkins) – three screens of heavily overlaid video with the middle screen overlaid by yet another layer of &quot;analog&quot; projections, including moiréd overlays and liquid/oil effects performed by &quot;something human&quot; a.k.a. Caleigh Fisher, a friend from the TOPY years. Videos from the upcoming album and DVDs were previewed as works in process. Much of the video work revolves around Breyer P-Orridges exploration of the &#x27;pandrogyne&#x27;.

P-Orridge and Mo Edley performed a DJ set and were interviewed on New York&#x27;s station WNYU on 5 September 2006. PTV3 performed several songs on WFMU in Jersey City on 7 September. The band were interviewed as well. This was the first time ever Psychic TV had played live on air. To inaugurate the release of &quot;Hell Is Invisible... Heaven Is Her/e&quot;, PTV3 hosted a five night residency in September 2006 at Galapagos Art Space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, USA, followed by the above-mentioned tour. &quot;Hell Is Invisible... Heaven Is Her/e&quot; was released in 2007.

In February 2007 the website Side-Line announced the news that the Fee Lee record label released a Psychic TV live album, &quot;Live in Russia&quot;. In the same year Psychic TV played at the ZXZW festival.

Lady Jaye died suddenly on 9 October 2007 at home in Brooklyn, New York, from a previously undiagnosed heart condition which is thought to have been connected with her long-term battle with stomach cancer. Lady Jaye collapsed and died in Genesis&#x27; arms, as described in the 2011 movie &quot;The Ballad Of Genesis And Lady Jaye&quot; by Marie Losier. 

PTV3 released the CD-DVD set &quot;Mr. Alien Brain vs. The Skinwalkers&quot; in December 2008, the first full-length release since the death of Genesis&#x27; &quot;other half&quot; Jaye Breyer (best known as Lady Jaye). The two had previously embarked on a years-long pursuit of &quot;pandrogyny&quot;, undergoing painful plastic surgery procedures to become gender-neutral human beings that looked like each other.

Band leader Genesis P-Orridge was diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia in October 2017, and died in New York City on 14 March 2020, aged 70.

== Live performances ==
Psychic TV have performed live many times in their career with an ever-changing and eclectic selection of musicians. Live releases account for about half of Psychic TV&#x27;s discography and with one series of live releases they released seventeen live albums in eighteen months, enough to earn them a place in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;.

On 4 November 2009, Genesis P-Orridge announced via their website, &quot;Genesis Breyer P-Orridge is retiring from touring in any and all bands including TG to concentrate on art, writing and music.&quot; However, with PTV3 they eventually went on a short European tour in 2013 and were performing occasionally in the US and elsewhere.

In 2016 Psychic TV toured internationally to support their &quot;Alienist&quot; release.

<doc id="391084" wikidata="Q378439" url="?curid=391084" title="Cao Ren">
<text>Cao Ren () (168 – 6 May 223), courtesy name Zixiao, was a military general serving during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China under the warlord Cao Cao, who was also his older second cousin. He continued serving in the state of Cao Wei – founded by Cao Cao&#x27;s son and successor, Cao Pi – during the Three Kingdoms period. He played a significant part in assisting Cao Cao in the civil wars leading to the end of the Han dynasty. He was appointed as the Grand Marshal (大司馬) when Cao Pi ascended the throne, and was also credited by the latter for the establishment of Wei. However, Cao Ren was also once derided as a mediocre commander by Zhu Huan, a general from Wei&#x27;s rival state Eastern Wu.

==Early life==
Cao Ren was a younger second cousin of Cao Cao. His grandfather Cao Bao (曹襃) and father Cao Chi (曹熾) served in the government of the Eastern Han dynasty. He had a younger full brother, Cao Chun. As their father died when they were still young, Cao Ren and Cao Chun lived with another family. They inherited their family fortune when they became older. They were known for being wealthy and having hundreds of servants and retainers.

As a youth, Cao Ren was fond of horse-riding, archery and hunting. When chaos broke out in China towards the end of the Han dynasty, Cao Ren rallied a militia of over 1,000 men and they wandered around the region near the Huai and Si rivers. Cao Ren and his followers eventually joined Cao Cao around 190 when the latter was raising an army to join the campaign against Dong Zhuo. Cao Ren held the rank of a Major of Separate Command (別部司馬) under Cao Cao but he was actually an acting Sharp Edge Colonel (厲鋒校尉).

==Campaigns in central China==
Throughout the 190s, Cao Ren followed Cao Cao on various campaigns against rival warlords in central China. He made great contributions in the campaign against Yuan Shu between 197 and 199. When Cao Cao invaded Xu Province from 193–194 to attack the provincial governor Tao Qian, Cao Ren was in charge of the cavalry and he led the vanguard. He defeated Tao Qian&#x27;s general Lü You (呂由) and led his force to rendezvous with Cao Cao&#x27;s main army at Pengcheng (彭城; present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu), where they scored a major victory over Tao Qian&#x27;s forces. Cao Ren and his cavalry later defeated Tao Qian&#x27;s subordinates in various battles at the counties in Xu Province. During the conflict between Cao Cao and Lü Bu, Cao Ren attacked Lü Bu&#x27;s subordinate Liu He (劉何) at Gouyang (勾陽) and captured the enemy commander alive.

After Cao Cao had defeated the Yellow Turban rebels, he received Emperor Xian (who had escaped from the clutches of Li Jue and Guo Si) and set up the new capital at Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) in 196. Cao Ren was appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Guangyang Commandery (廣陽郡) for his achievements. However, Cao Ren never exercised governorship over his jurisdiction because Cao Cao appreciated his military skills and kept him by his side in Xu. Cao Ren was still in charge of the cavalry even though he held the position of a civil official as a Consultant (議郎).

The following year, Cao Ren followed Cao Cao on a campaign against the warlord Zhang Xiu, and was authorised to lead a separate force to raid the counties around Zhang Xiu&#x27;s base in Wan (宛; or Wancheng, present-day Wancheng District, Nanyang, Henan) and he captured over 3,000 civilians. Zhang Xiu surrendered to Cao Cao initially, but rebelled later and launched a surprise attack, which led to the Battle of Wancheng. Cao Cao was defeated and he retreated after his forces succeeded in repelling further attacks by Zhang Xiu. However, as they were withdrawing, Zhang Xiu attacked again and Cao Cao&#x27;s men were unable to drive the enemy away. The morale of Cao Cao&#x27;s army started falling but Cao Ren helped to raise the soldiers&#x27; spirits by encouraging and inspiring them. Cao Cao was very impressed with Cao Ren, and he managed to defeat Zhang Xiu later in a counterattack.

==Campaign against Yuan Shao==
In 200, when the forces of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao were locked in a stalemate at the Battle of Guandu, Yuan sent Liu Bei with an army to support the rebellions against Cao Cao in Yinjiang (氵隱疆; southwest of present-day Xuchang, Henan), roughly 8.3 km south of the capital. Cao Cao became worried about such developments in the territories under his control, so he sent Cao Ren to suppress the uprisings. Cao Ren observed that the rebels dared to create trouble because they had Liu Bei&#x27;s support, but the men under Liu were newly recruited and inexperienced, so it was not difficult to defeat them. Cao Ren targeted the rebel chief Liu Pi and killed him in battle, and subsequently defeated Liu Bei as well. Yuan Shao attempted to cut off Cao Cao&#x27;s route to the west by sending Han Meng (韓猛) southwest. Cao Ren responded to the threat by defeating Han Meng at Jiluo Hill (雞洛山; located 50 &quot;li&quot; northeast of present-day Xinmi, Henan). Yuan Shao became afraid and did not dare to send out his troops. Cao Ren and Shi Huan (史渙) later led a force to attack a convoy transporting supplies to Yuan Shao&#x27;s camp and destroyed the food supplies.

After Cao Cao&#x27;s victory at Guandu, Cao Ren continued to join Cao Cao in his campaigns against Yuan Shao&#x27;s heirs in the early 3rd century. During one battle near Hu Pass (壺關; present-day Huguan County, Shanxi), Cao Cao gave orders that all the enemy troops would be buried alive after the city fell. However, after several days of siege, Cao Cao&#x27;s forces were unable to capture the city. Cao Ren then told Cao Cao, &quot;When we besiege a city, we must leave the defenders with a final option of surrendering. Now, as you&#x27;ve already said that the defenders would be slaughtered after the city is taken, all of them would definitely put up fierce resistance. Besides, the city&#x27;s fortifications are strong and the defenders have much supplies, so our forces would suffer heavy casualties if we attack, and we will be held up here if we switch to a defensive stance. It&#x27;s not a wise choice to besiege a city whose defenders are willing to fight to the death.&quot; Cao Cao heeded Cao Ren&#x27;s advice, and the enemy surrendered later. After the campaign, Cao Ren received the title of a &quot;Marquis of a Chief Village&quot; (都亭侯) for his contributions.

==Battle of Jiangling, and campaigns in northwest China==
In 208, after losing to Sun Quan and Liu Bei at the Battle of Red Cliffs, Cao Cao retreated north and left Cao Ren and Xu Huang to defend the strategic Jiangling Commandery (江陵郡; in present-day Jingzhou, Hubei) from the advances of Sun Quan&#x27;s forces, which were led by Zhou Yu. Cao Ren was serving as acting General Who Attacks the South (征南將軍) then. Zhou Yu despatched a several thousand-strong vanguard to challenge Cao Cao&#x27;s forces at Jiangling. Cao Ren was aware that his army&#x27;s morale was low, since they were recently defeated at Red Cliffs, so he ordered his subordinate Niu Jin to lead 300 volunteer soldiers into battle, in the hope that they would display bravery and boost his men&#x27;s morale. Niu Jin and his men were heavily outnumbered and surrounded by the enemy. Cao Ren&#x27;s Chief Clerk (長史), Chen Jiao (陳矯), turned pale when he saw the situation from the top of the city walls. However, unlike what everyone thought, Niu Jin managed to create havoc around the Wu&#x27;s army with just 100 men left by then. Cao Ren experienced a surge of fury and courage after watching how Niu Jin with so little men could make the entire Wu army three times the strength get so tired battling just 300 of his own men, so he ordered every troop in the city to be prepared to go into battle. Chen Jiao and the others attempted to dissuade him from braving danger, but Cao Ren ignored them and every soldiers in his command was ordered to charged into the enemy formation. Cao Ren successfully rescued Niu Jin and his surviving men and even turned back to save his remaining soldiers who were still trapped in the enemy formation. Sun Quan&#x27;s forces retreated. When Cao Ren returned, his subordinates exclaimed, &quot;General, you&#x27;re truly a man from Heaven!&quot; The troops were awed by Cao Ren&#x27;s bravery, and Cao Cao was very impressed when he heard about this incident. Cao Ren&#x27;s marquis title was changed to &quot;Marquis of Anping Village&quot; (安平亭侯).

Around 211, Cao Ren participated in Cao Cao&#x27;s campaigns against a coalition of northwestern warlords led by Ma Chao and Han Sui, which led to the Battle of Tong Pass. Cao Ren held the appointment of acting General Who Stabilises the West (安西將軍) and commanded the defence at Tong Pass (潼關; present-day Tongguan County, Weinan, Shaanxi) before Cao Cao reached the frontline.

When Su Bo (蘇伯) and Tian Yin (田銀) rebelled in 212, Cao Ren was appointed acting General of Valiant Cavalry (驍騎將軍) and he led seven armies to attack the rebels and defeated them.

==Battle of Fancheng==
Cao Ren was reappointed acting General Who Attacks the South (征南將軍) was ordered to garrison at Fan (樊; also called Fancheng, in present-day Fancheng District, Xiangfan, Hubei) and oversee Cao Cao&#x27;s forces in Jing Province. Cao Ren suppressed a rebellion led by Hou Yin (侯音) before massacring the population of Wan (宛; present-day Wancheng District, Nanyang, Henan) between late 218 and early 219, he was then officially commissioned as General Who Attacks the South and he continued to garrison at Fan. 

In the autumn of 219, Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu, who was in charge of Liu&#x27;s territories in southern Jing Province, led an army north to attack Fan. Cao Cao sent the general Yu Jin to lead seven armies to resist Guan Yu, but the armies were destroyed in a flood when the Han River overflowed due to heavy rains. Yu Jin surrendered to Guan Yu while his subordinate Pang De refused and was executed by Guan. Cao Ren was left with a few thousand troops to defend Fan. Guan Yu and his forces sailed towards Fan on boats and besieged the fortress. By then, Cao Ren and his troops had been completely isolated inside Fan as they had lost contact with outside, while their supplies were running out and there were no reinforcements in sight. Cao Ren encouraged his men to fight to the death and they were very inspired by his words. By the time reinforcements led by Xu Huang arrived, the water level had subsided slightly. While Xu Huang was attacking Guan Yu, Cao Ren seized the opportunity to counterattack and break the siege. Guan Yu failed to conquer Fan so he retreated.

==Service under Cao Pi==
Although Cao Ren behaved brashly and had no regard for laws when he was young, but after he joined the Cao Cao&#x27;s Army, he started following rules and regulations strictly and he went by the book in everything he did. Once, when Cao Cao&#x27;s son Cao Zhang was on away on a campaign against the Wuhuan, his brother Cao Pi wrote to him, &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t you follow rules and regulations in the same way Cao Ren does?&quot;

Cao Cao died in 220 and was succeeded as King of Wei by Cao Pi. Later that year, Cao Pi, with the support of all the officials, made Emperor Xian to pass the throne to him, finally putting an end to the crumbling Han dynasty, and established the state of Cao Wei, the strongest of the three Kingdoms. Cao Ren was appointed as General of Chariots and Cavalry (車騎將軍) and was placed in charge of military affairs in Jing, Yang and Yi provinces. He also received the title &quot;Marquis of Chen&quot; (陳侯) and was given 2,000 more taxable households in his marquisate, making it a total of 3,500 households.

Cao Ren moved to Wan (宛; present-day Wancheng District, Nanyang, Henan) in northern Jing Province and garrisoned there. Later, when Sun Quan sent Chen Shao (陳邵) to attack Xiangyang, Emperor Wen(Cao pi) ordered Cao Ren to lead an army to Xiangyang to resist Sun Quan&#x27;s forces. Cao Ren and Xu Huang defeated Chen Shao and their forces entered Xiangyang. Cao Ren had the general Gao Qian (高遷) oversee the relocation of civilians from the southern bank of the Han River to the north. Emperor Wen appointed Cao Ren as General-in-Chief (大將軍). Later, Emperor Wen ordered Cao Ren to move to Linying (臨潁) and promoted him to Grand Marshal (大司馬). Cao Ren was placed in charge of the armies along the Wu River (烏江) and he garrisoned at Hefei. In 222, Cao Ren led several tens of thousands men to assail Sun Quan&#x27;s garrison at Ruxu (濡須; north of present-day Wuwei County, Anhui), where the defending general, Zhu Huan, had only 5,000 troops remaining inside the city walls. However, Cao Ren was deemed only as an inferior commander by Zhu Huan and his colleagues, so the defenders put up a staunch defence. Even though Cao Ren had a complete numerical advantage, the battle concluded with Zhu Huan as the victor – Cao Ren lost not only over 1,000 men, but also two of his subordinates, Chang Diao (常雕) and Wang Shuang.

==Death==
Cao Ren died on 6 May 223 at the age of 56 (by East Asian age reckoning). He was posthumously granted the title &quot;Marquis Zhong&quot; (忠侯), which literally means &quot;loyal marquis&quot;. He was best remembered for his bravery and courage, which placed him above Zhang Liao among all of Cao Cao&#x27;s generals.

==Family==
Cao Ren&#x27;s grandfather Cao Bao (曹褒) served as the Administrator (太守) of Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡) in the Eastern Han dynasty. Cao Ren&#x27;s father Cao Chi (曹熾) also served as a Palace Attendant (侍中) and Changshui Colonel (長水校尉) in the Eastern Han dynasty, and was posthumously awarded the title &quot;Marquis Mu of Chen&quot; (陳穆侯) by Cao Pi. Cao Ren&#x27;s younger brother Cao Chun was also a general under Cao Cao.

Cao Ren&#x27;s titles were inherited by his son Cao Tai (曹泰), who served as General Who Guards the East (鎮東將軍) and later had his marquis title changed to &quot;Marquis of Ningling&quot; (寗陵侯). Cao Tai was succeeded by his son Cao Chu (曹初). Cao Ren&#x27;s other sons (Cao Tai&#x27;s younger brothers) Cao Kai (曹楷) and Cao Fan (曹範) also received marquis titles.

==In popular culture==
Cao Ren is featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series.

In the collectible card game &quot;&quot; there is a card named &quot;Cao Ren, Wei Commander&quot; in the &quot;Portal Three Kingdoms&quot; set.

<doc id="391088" wikidata="Q6078034" url="?curid=391088" title="Isabella Macdonald">
<text>Isabella Macdonald ( Clark; 1809 – 28 December 1857) was the first wife of John A. Macdonald, one of the fathers of the Canadian federation, and ultimately the first Prime Minister of Canada. After marrying Macdonald in Kingston, Ontario in 1843, she enjoyed two years of happy marriage before falling seriously ill. Her first son died at 13 months but her second son, Hugh John Macdonald, became Premier of Manitoba. Despite some better spells, she died aged 48, never recovering from her illness.

== Early life and family ==
Isabella Clark was born in Dalnavert in Inverness-shire, Scotland.

She met her husband to be, her half-cousin John Alexander Macdonald, while he was in Great Britain in 1842. The visit included a trip to Douglas on the Isle of Man to see his cousin Margaret Greene née Clark who lived in a small farmhouse near Douglas together with her sister Isabella. Macdonald took an immediate liking to Isabella, suggesting she should visit Kingston the following year, ostensibly to see another of her sisters, Maria, who had married John Alexander Macpherson. Isabella complied, sailing to Canada in 1843 to visit the Macphersons in Kingston, Ontario, as well as the Macdonalds. It was on this trip that after a few months courting, they were engaged and finally married on September 1, 1843, at the home of her sister, Maria and brother-in-law John Alexander Macpherson with the Rev. Mr. Machar of St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church (Kingston, Ontario)officiating. The couple were related by sharing their maternal grandmother; cousin marriage was not uncommon at the time. They lived together in Kingston. 

Isabella bore two sons with John. The first was named John, born in New York in August 1847. She was 39 years old. Isabella&#x27;s health after the birth was not good - it took several months of rest before she was able to return to Kingston. The baby died at the age of 13 months. She gave birth to their second son at the age of 41. This child was Hugh John Macdonald, who grew up to be a lawyer and politician.

== Illness ==
Approximately two years after her marriage to John A. Macdonald, Isabella&#x27;s health began to deteriorate. She had a variety of symptoms, including headaches, a bad cough, fatigue, and general pain. The pain would often be so bad she would be unable to get out of bed.

Several strategies were used to attempt to improve her health. John took her to New York to see if the doctors there were able to help her, and she would escape the cold climate of Kingston, Ontario by visiting her sister in Savannah, Georgia for a few months at a time. John rented Bellevue House, a home in the Western Liberties neighborhood of Kingston (a quieter, cleaner area of town) as a restful space for Isabella to improve her health, and recover.

Unfortunately, she never recovered her health, and died on December 28, 1857, at the age of 48. She is buried at the Cataraqui Cemetery, in the Macdonald family plot.

<text>Wallace Earle Stegner (February 18, 1909 – April 13, 1993) was an American novelist, writer, environmentalist, and historian. He was often called &quot;The Dean of Western Writers&quot;. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1972 and the U.S. National Book Award in 1977.

==Personal life==
Stegner was born in Lake Mills, Iowa, and grew up in Great Falls, Montana; Salt Lake City, Utah; and the village of Eastend, Saskatchewan, which he wrote about in his autobiography &quot;Wolf Willow&quot;. Stegner says he &quot;lived in twenty places in eight states and Canada&quot;. He was the son of Hilda (née Paulson) and George Stegner. Stegner summered in Greensboro, Vermont. While living in Utah, he joined a Boy Scout troop at an LDS Church (although he himself was a Lutheran) and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. He received a B.A. at the University of Utah in 1930. While at the University of Utah he was initiated into Sigma Nu fraternity. He was inducted into the Sigma Nu Hall of Honor at the 68th Grand Chapter in Washington D.C. He also studied at the University of Iowa, where he received a master&#x27;s degree in 1932 and a doctorate in 1935.

In 1934, Stegner married Mary Stuart Page. For 59 years they shared a &quot;personal literary partnership of singular facility,&quot; in the words of Arthur Schlesinger Jr. Stegner died in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on April 13, 1993, as the result of a car accident on March 28, 1993.

Stegner&#x27;s son, Page Stegner, was a novelist, essayist, nature writer and professor emeritus at University of California, Santa Cruz. Page was married to Lynn Stegner, a novelist. Page co-authored &quot;American Places&quot; and edited the 2008 &quot;Collected Letters of Wallace Stegner&quot;. He was Thomas Heggen&#x27;s cousin.

===Activism===
In the 1940s, Stegner was a leading member of the Peninsula Housing Association, a group of locals in Palo Alto aiming to build a large co-operative housing complex for Stanford University faculty and staff on a 260-acre ranch the group had purchased near campus. Private lenders and the Federal Housing Authority would not provide financing to the group because three of the families were African-American. Rather than be a party to housing discrimination by proceeding without these families, the group abandoned the project and eventually sold the land.

==Career==
Stegner taught at the University of Wisconsin and Harvard University. Eventually he settled at Stanford University, where he founded the creative writing program. His students included Wendell Berry, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, Edward Abbey, Simin Daneshvar, Andrew Glaze, George V. Higgins, Thomas McGuane, Robert Stone, Ken Kesey, Gordon Lish, Ernest Gaines, and Larry McMurtry. He served as a special assistant to Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall and was elected to the Sierra Club&#x27;s board of directors for a term that lasted 1964–1966. He also moved into a house near Matadero Creek on Three Forks Road in nearby Los Altos Hills and became one of the town&#x27;s most prominent residents. In 1962, he co-founded the Committee for Green Foothills, an environmental organization dedicated to preserving and protecting the hills, forests, creeks, wetlands and coastal lands of the San Francisco Peninsula.

Stegner&#x27;s novel &quot;Angle of Repose&quot; (first published by Doubleday in early 1971) won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1972. It was based on the letters of Mary Hallock Foote (first published in 1972 by Huntington Library Press as the memoir &quot;A Victorian Gentlewoman in the Far West&quot;). Stegner explained his use of unpublished archival letters briefly at the beginning of &quot;Angle of Repose&quot; but his use of uncredited passages taken directly from Foote&#x27;s letters caused a continuing controversy.

In 1977 Stegner won the National Book Award for &quot;The Spectator Bird.&quot; In 1992, he refused a National Medal from the National Endowment for the Arts because he believed the NEA had become too politicized. Stegner&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Crossing to Safety&quot; (1987) gained broad literary acclaim and commercial popularity.

Stegner&#x27;s non-fiction works include &quot;Beyond the Hundredth Meridian: John Wesley Powell and the Second Opening of the West&quot; (1954), a biography of John Wesley Powell, the first white man to explore the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. Powell later served as a government scientist and was an advocate of water conservation in the American West. Stegner wrote the foreword to and edited &quot;This Is Dinosaur&quot;, with photographs by Philip Hyde. The Sierra Club book was used in the campaign to prevent dams in Dinosaur National Monument and helped launch the modern environmental movement. A substantial number of Stegner&#x27;s works are set in and around Greensboro, Vermont, where he lived part-time. Some of his character representations (particularly in &quot;Second Growth&quot;) were sufficiently unflattering that residents took offense, and he did not visit Greensboro for several years after its publication.

==Legacy==
The Wallace Stegner Chair in Western American Studies at Montana State University was established to honor more than half a century of wisdom and commitment that novelist, historian, and conservationist Wallace Stegner contributed to the culture and society of the West. Stegner applauded the choice of Montana State University as the site of a chair in his name. “There’s an awakening in the rest of the country to the West and what it’s about,” he wrote shortly before his death in the spring of 1993. “And the West is waking up to itself. A chair in Western American Studies at MSU is a splendid way to inform the West about itself.”

On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Stegner&#x27;s birth, Timothy Egan reflected in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on the writer&#x27;s legacy, including his perhaps troubled relationship with the newspaper itself. Over 100 readers including Jane Smiley offered comments on the subject.

In recognition of Stegner&#x27;s legacy at the University of Utah, The Wallace Stegner Prize in Environmental or American Western History was established in 2010 and is administered by the University of Utah Press. This book publication prize is awarded to the best monograph the Press receives on the topic of American western or environmental history within a predetermined time period.

Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho, has a history of presenting an annual lecture titled after Stegner. The Wallace Stegner Lecture has long been a literary-cultural highlight for the LCSC community. The annual lecture features discussions about the writer&#x27;s relationship with the physical and psychological territories in which he or she resides.

The Stegner Fellowship program at Stanford University is a two-year creative writing fellowship. The house Stegner lived in from age 7 to 12 in Eastend, Saskatchewan, Canada, was restored by the Eastend Arts Council in 1990 and established as a Residence for Artists; the Wallace Stegner Grant For The Arts offers a grant of $500 and free residency at the house for the month of October for published Canadian writers. In 2003, the indie rock trio Mambo Sons released the Stegner-influenced song &quot;Little Live Thing / Cross to Safety&quot; written by Scott Lawson and Tom Guerra, which resulted in an invitation for Lawson to serve as Artist-in-Residency for March 2009.

In 2005, the Los Altos History Museum mounted an exhibition entitled &quot;Wallace Stegner: Throwing a Long Shadow&quot; providing a retrospective of the author&#x27;s life and works.

In May 2011, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that Stegner&#x27;s Los Altos Hills home, which was sold in 2005, was scheduled to be demolished by the current owners. Lynn Stegner said the family attempted to sell the home to Stanford University in an attempt to preserve it, but the university said the home would be sold at market value, customary for real estate donated to Stanford. Wallace Stegner&#x27;s wife, Mary, said that Wallace would disapprove of the fuss surrounding the issue. Wallace initially opposed the creation of a hiking path near his home but Mary Stegner confided that her husband later came to enjoy walking on it, and the path was eventually named for him posthumously, in 2008.

In August 2016 a public charter school called the Wallace Stegner Academy opened in Salt Lake City, Utah. The school was named after Wallace Stegner because the founders valued people like Stegner who are devoted to academics and pursue the advancement of knowledge and art throughout their entire lives.

The Wallace Earle Stegner papers (Ms0676), 1935–2004, can be found at the University of Utah Marriott Library Special Collections Manuscripts Division. With 29 boxes and 139 linear feet, the collections contains personal and professional correspondence, journals, manuscript drafts for work both published and unpublished, research material, memorabilia, scrapbooks, books containing letters of condolence compiled by Mary Stegner, and Wallace&#x27;s personal typewriter.

The Wallace Stegner Research Collection: 1942–1996, Collection 2443, can be found at the Montana State University Archives and Special Collections in Bozeman, Montana. This collection of published materials and correspondence by and about Stegner was compiled by Nancy Colberg, a librarian and the author of &quot;Wallace Stegner: A Descriptive Bibliography&quot; and former owner of Willow Creek Books in Denver, Colorado. The materials were sold to the Archives in 2001. The collection contains Stegner articles and short stories from newspapers and periodicals, published interviews and articles about Stegner and his work, and personal and professional correspondence. A smaller collection of materials relating to Stegner gathered by Thomas H. Watkins was later added to Collection 2443. The collection is divided into four series with a total of 7 boxes or 3.2 linear feet.

<text>In social anthropology, matrilocal residence or matrilocality (also uxorilocal residence or uxorilocality) is the societal system in which a married couple resides with or near the wife&#x27;s parents. 

== Description ==
Frequently, visiting marriage is being practiced, meaning that husband and wife are living apart, in their separate birth families, and seeing each other in their spare time. The children of such marriages are raised by the mother&#x27;s extended matrilineal clan. The father does not have to be involved in the upbringing of his own children; he does, however, in that of his sisters&#x27; children (his nieces and nephews). In direct consequence, property is inherited from generation to generation, and, overall, remains largely undivided.

Matrilocal residence is found most often in horticultural societies.

Examples of matrilocal societies include the people of Ngazidja in the Comoros, the Ancestral Puebloans of Chaco Canyon, the Nair community in Kerala in South India, the Moso of Yunnan and Sichuan in southwestern China, the Siraya of Taiwan, and the Minangkabau of western Sumatra. Among indigenous people of the Amazon basin this residence pattern is often associated with the customary practice of brideservice, as seen among the Urarina of northeastern Peru. 

During the Song Dynasty in medieval China, matrilocal marriage became common for wealthy non-aristocratic families.

In other regions of the world, such as Japan, during the Heian period, a marriage of this type was not a sign of high status, but rather an indication of the patriarchal authority of the woman&#x27;s family (her father or grandfather), who was sufficiently powerful to demand it.

Another matrilocal society is the !Kung San of Southern Africa. They practice uxorilocality for the bride service period, which lasts until the couple has produced three children or they have been together for more than ten years. At the end of the bride service period, the couple has a choice of which clan they want to live with. (Technically, uxorilocality differs from matrilocality; uxorilocality means the couple settles with the wife&#x27;s family, while matrilocality means the couple settles with the wife&#x27;s lineage. Because the !Kung do not live in lineages, they cannot be matrilocal; they are uxorilocal.)

Early theories explaining the determinants of postmarital residence (by, for example, Lewis Henry Morgan, Edward Tylor, and George Peter Murdock) connected it with the sexual division of labor. However, for many years cross-cultural tests of this hypothesis using worldwide samples failed to find any significant relationship between these two variables. On the other hand, Korotayev&#x27;s tests have shown that the female contribution to subsistence does correlate significantly with matrilocal residence in general; however, this correlation is masked by a general polygyny factor. Although an increase in the female contribution to subsistence tends to lead to matrilocal residence, it also tends simultaneously to lead to general non-sororal polygyny which effectively destroys matrilocality. If this polygyny factor is controlled (e.g., through a multiple regression model), division of labor turns out to be a significant predictor of postmarital residence. Thus, Murdock&#x27;s hypotheses regarding the relationships between the sexual division of labor and postmarital residence were basically correct, though, as has been shown by Korotayev, the actual relationships between those two groups of variables are more complicated than he expected.

Matrilocality in the Arikari culture in the 17th–18th centuries was studied anew within feminist archaeology by Christi Mitchell, in a critique of a previous study, the critique challenging whether men were virtually the sole agents of societal change while women were only passive.

According to Barbara Epstein, anthropologists in the 20th century criticized feminist promatriarchal views and said that &quot;the goddess worship or matrilocality that evidently existed in many paleolithic societies was not necessarily associated with matriarchy in the sense of women&#x27;s power over men. Many societies can be found that exhibit those qualities along with female subordination. Furthermore, militarism, destruction of the natural environment, and hierarchical social structures can be found in societies in which goddess worship, matrilocality, or matriliny exist.&quot;

In sociobiology, matrilocality refers to animal societies in which a pair bond is formed between animals born or hatched in different areas or different social groups, and the pair becomes resident in the female&#x27;s home area or group.

In present-day mainland China, matrilocal residence has been encouraged by the government in an attempt to counter the problem of unbalanced male-majority sex ratios caused by the abortion, infanticide and abandonment of girls. Because girls traditionally marry out in virilocal marriage (living with or near the husband&#x27;s parents) they have been seen as &quot;mouths from another family&quot; or as a waste of resources to raise.

<doc id="391100" wikidata="Q313889" url="?curid=391100" title="Perdiccas I of Macedon">
<text>Perdiccas I (; ) was king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon. By allowing thirty years for the span of an average generation from the beginning of Archelaus&#x27; reign in 413 BC, British historian Nicholas Hammond estimated that Perdiccas ruled around 653 BC. 

There are two separate historical traditions describing the foundation of the Argead dynasty. The earlier, documented by Herodotus and Thucydides in the fifth century BC, records Perdiccas as the first king of Macedonia. The later tradition first emerged sometime at the beginning of the fourth century BC and claimed that Caranus, rather than Perdiccas, was the founder. Aside from Satyrus, who adds Coenus and Tyrimmas to the list, Marsyas of Pella, Theopompos, and Justin all agree that Caranus was Perdiccas&#x27; father. Furthermore, Plutarch claimed in his biography of Alexander the Great that all of his sources agreed that Caranus was the founder. This unhistorical assertion is rejected by modern scholarship as Argead court propaganda, possibly intended to diminish the significance of the name &#x27;Perdiccas&#x27; in rival family branches following Amyntas III accession.

<text>Perdiccas II () was the king of Macedonia from 454 BC until his death in 413 BC. During the Peloponnesian War, he frequently switched sides between Sparta and Athens.

== Biography ==

=== Family ===
Perdiccas II was the oldest son of Alexander I. He had four brothers: Alcetas, Amyntas, Menelaus, and Philip. Menelaus was the father of the future king Amyntas II while Amyntas&#x27; grandson would be king Amyntas III. Around 429/428 BC, Perdiccas successfully negotiated an end to a Thracian invasion of Macedonia by arranging for his sister Stratonice to marry Seuthes, nephew of the Thracian king Sitalces.

During his reign, Perdiccas married at least two women: Simache and Cleopatra. The former, mother of Archelaus and Aeropus II, is accused by Plato, through his interlocutors in Gorgias, of having been a slave of Alcetas. It is doubtful, however, that Archelaus would have been treated as legitimate if his mother had been a slave and therefore Simache was most likely a member of the Macedonian elite (albeit nonroyal). 

Cleopatra, possibly a Lyncestian or even Argead, bore one presently unnamed son to Perdiccas. According to Plato, Archelaus drowned this son in a well when he was seven years old because he was considered the legitimate heir. There is strong evidence to suggest that Cleopatra married Archelaus, her step-son, following the death of Perdiccas, but this has been disputed by historians like Nicholas Hammond.

=== Reign ===

The unexpected death of Alexander I in 454 precipitated a dynastic crisis In Macedonia. Perdiccas ascended to the throne as the oldest son, but at least two of his four brothers, Philip and Alcetas, obtained their own local realms (&quot;arkhai&quot;). He annexed Alcetas&#x27; territory at some unknown date, but Philip&#x27;s control of the strategically important Axios Valley around Amphaxitis proved more difficult to overcome. In 433, Philip formed an alliance with King Derdas I of Elimiotis in Upper Macedonia and Athens, promising to defend each other and refrain from aiding Philip&#x27;s enemies. Perdiccas responded by stirring up rebellion in a number of Athenian tribute cities, including Potidaea.

Athens responded with force, and sent 1000 hoplites and 30 ships to Macedonia where they captured Therma. They went on to besiege Pydna, where they were met by reinforcements of a further 2000 hoplites and 40 ships. However, as the Athenians were besieging Pydna, they received news that Corinth had sent a force of 1600 hoplites and 400 light troops to support Potidaea.

In order to combat this new threat, Athens made an alliance with Perdiccas, and proceeded to Potidaea. Perdiccas immediately broke the treaty and marched to Potidaea. While the Athenians were eventually victorious, the battle (along with the Battle of Sybota) directly led to the Peloponnesian War.

In autumn 431, Athens entered into an alliance with the Odyrisian king Sitalces following the diplomatic efforts of his Greek brother-in-law, Nymphodorus of Abdera. Nymphodorus then arranged a deal between Athens and Perdiccas in which Macedonia regained Therma in exchange for Perdiccas agreeing to march alongside them against the rebel Chalcidians. It was at this point that Athens finally abandoned Philip and he fled to Thrace with his son Amyntas. 

However, Thucydides then reports that Sitalces invaded Macedonia in 429 with a large army and Amyntas in tow, apparently upset with Perdiccas for an unfulfilled (and thus far unknown) promise made in 431. Attacking &#x27;Lower Macedonia from the top,&#x27; Sitalces marched through Mt. Cercine (now Mt. Ograzden) and entered Philip&#x27;s former territory via Valandovo, supposedly with an army of 150,000 men. A number of cities in the region, with the notable exception of Europus, went over to the Thracians and the Macedonians were forced to retreat to their strongholds. That they were unprepared for the invasion is possibly a consequence of Perdiccas having earlier sent 1000 Macedonians to support the Spartan general Cnemus&#x27; invasion of pro-Athenian Acarnania. Macedonian resistance proved limited, and Sitalces freely ravaged Mygdonia, Crestonia, and Anthemus, save for an ineffective cavalry attack by Perdiccas&#x27; Orestian allies. Nevertheless, the invasion faltered for a number of reasons. Firstly, supplies began to run low as it was winter and a promised Athenian fleet never materialized. Although they were ostensibly allies, the Athenians were likely concerned about the prospect of a Thracian client on the Macedonian throne following the rapid advance of the ambitious Sitalces. Furthermore, Seuthes, an influential nephew and officer of Sitalces, successfully persuaded the king to return home after Perdiccas had secretly promised him a large dowry and the marriage of his sister Stratonice. Thucydides states that Sitalces left after &quot;a stay of thirty days in all, eight of which were spent in Chalcidice.&quot; 

After this, Perdiccas was allied to the Spartans and, in 424, helped the Spartan Brasidas to take Amphipolis from the Athenians, one of her most important colonies, mainly for its ready access to timber for her fleets. This was a severe blow to Athens, and would tie them to Macedonian timber for years to come, which strengthened Macedonia&#x27;s bargaining power considerably. In return for this, the Spartans helped Perdiccas secure his borders, by leading an assault on King Arrhabaeus of Lyncestis, with the promise of support from the Illyrians (Battle of Lyncestis). However, the Illyrians switched sides and attacked Perdiccas and his Spartan allies. The poorly trained Macedonian troops fled, and so the Spartans also retreated and attacked the Macedonian baggage train in anger. This soured relations between Macedonia and the Peloponnese for years to come, and pushed Perdiccas closer to Athens, allying himself with them in 423.

By 417, Perdiccas had left the Athenians and joined the Spartan-Argive alliance. Just four years later, bowing to Athenian pressure, Perdiccas broke with the Peloponnese, and aided Athens in their attack on Amphipolis.

In 413/2 BC he died, leaving his son Archelaus as heir.

<text>Perdiccas III (Greek: Περδίκκας Γ΄) was king of the Hellenistic kingdom of Macedonia from 365 BC to 360 BC, succeeding his brother Alexander II.

Son of Amyntas III and Eurydice, he was a child when in 369 BC his brother Alexander II was killed by their brother-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros, who then ruled as regent. In 365 BC, Perdiccas killed Ptolemy and assumed government.

There is very little information about the reign of Perdiccas III. He was at one time engaged in hostilities with Athens over Amphipolis, and he was distinguished for his patronage of men of letters. Among these we are told that Euphraeus of Oreus, a disciple of Plato, rose so high in Perdiccas&#x27;s favour as to completely govern the young king and to exclude from his society all but philosophers and geometers.

He also served as &quot;theorodokos&quot; in the Panhellenic Games that took place in Epidaurus around 360/359 BC.
In 360 BC, Perdiccas tried to reconquer upper Macedonia from the Illyrian Bardylis, but the expedition ended in disaster, with Perdiccas being killed. Diodorus Siculus attests that four thousand men had died in the expedition, and that the remainder, panic-stricken, had become exceedingly afraid of the Illyrian armies and had lost heart for continuing the war.

Perdiccas was succeeded by his infant son, Amyntas IV. The throne was soon usurped by Perdiccas&#x27;s younger brother Philip II.

<text>Moshé Pinchas Feldenkrais (, May 6, 1904 – July 1, 1984) was a Ukrainian-Israeli engineer and physicist, known as the founder of the Feldenkrais Method.

Feldenkrais&#x27; theory is that &quot;thought, feeling, perception and movement are closely interrelated and influence each other.&quot;

==Life==
Moshé Pinchas Feldenkrais was born in 1904 to a Ukrainian Jewish family in the Russian Empire city of Slavuta (now in Ukraine) and grew up in the Russian Empire city of Baranovichi (now in Belarus). In 1918, he immigrated to The British Mandate of Palestine. He worked as a laborer and obtained his high school diploma from Gymnasia Herzliya in 1925. After graduation, he worked as a cartographer for the British survey office and began to study self-defense, including Ju-Jitsu. He suffered a soccer injury in 1929 that was aggravated during World War II, prompting him to develop his own method of healing.

During the 1930s, Feldenkrais lived in France, where he earned his engineering degree from the École Spéciale des Travaux Publics. Later he earned his Doctor of Science in Physics at the University of Paris, where Marie Curie was one of his teachers.

He worked as a research assistant to nuclear chemist and Nobel Prize laureate Frédéric Joliot-Curie at the Radium Institute. In September 1933, he met Jigoro Kano, the founder of judo in Paris. Kano encouraged him to study judo under Mikinosuke Kawaishi. Feldenkrais became a close friend of Kano and corresponded with him regularly. In 1936, he earned a black belt in judo, and later gained his 2nd degree black belt in 1938. He was a co-founding member of the Ju-Jitsu Club de France, one of the oldest Judo clubs in Europe, which still exists today. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie and Bertrand Goldschmidt took Judo lessons from Feldenkrais during their time together at the institute.

On the eve of the Nazi invasion of France in 1940, Feldenkrais fled to Britain with a jar of heavy water and a sheaf of research material, with instructions to deliver them to the British Admiralty War Office. Until 1946, he was a science officer in the Admiralty working on anti-submarine weaponry in Fairlie, Scotland. His work on improving sonar led to several patents. He also taught self-defense techniques to his fellow servicemen. On slippery submarine decks, he re-aggravated an old soccer knee injury. Refusing an operation, he was prompted to intently explore and develop self-rehabilitation and awareness techniques by self-observation, which he later developed as his method. His discoveries led him to begin sharing with others (including colleague J. D. Bernal) through lectures, experimental classes, and one-on-one work with a few.

After leaving the Admiralty, Feldenkrais lived and worked in private industry in London. His self-rehabilitation enabled him to continue his judo practice. From his position on the International Judo Committee, he began to study judo scientifically, incorporating the knowledge that he had gained by self-rehabilitation. In 1949, he published the first book on his method, &quot;Body and Mature Behavior: A Study of Anxiety, Sex, Gravitation and Learning&quot;. He studied the work of Gurdjieff, F. Matthias Alexander, Elsa Gindler and William Bates. He also traveled to Switzerland to study with Heinrich Jacoby.
In 1951, he returned to Israel. In 1954, after directing the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Department of Electronics for several years, he settled in Tel Aviv and began to teach his method full-time. In 1957, he met Mia Segal, who became his assistant and worked with him for thirty years. He also became the personal trainer of David Ben-Gurion, the Prime Minister of Israel, whom he taught to stand on his head in a yoga pose.

Throughout the 1960s, 1970s and in 1980 he presented his method in Europe and in North America (including an Awareness Through Movement program for human potential trainers at Esalen Institute in 1972). He trained the first group of 13 teachers in the method from 1969 to 1971 in Tel Aviv. Over the course of four summers, from 1975 to 1978, he trained 65 teachers in San Francisco at Lone Mountain College under the auspices of the Humanistic Psychology Institute. In 1980, 235 students began his summer teacher-training course at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. After becoming ill in the fall of 1981, after teaching two of the planned four summers, he stopped teaching publicly.

==Feldenkrais Method==
The Feldenkrais Method is intended to teach better movement and improve quality of life, by means of instruction and gentle manipulation of the body.

<text>Charlotte, Princess Royal (Charlotte Augusta Matilda; 29 September 1766 – 6 October 1828), was Queen of Württemberg as the wife of King Frederick I. She was the eldest daughter and fourth child of George III of the United Kingdom and his wife, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

==Early life==
Princess Charlotte was born on 29 September 1766 at Buckingham House, London, to King George III and Queen Charlotte. She was christened on 27 October 1766 at St James&#x27;s Palace by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Secker, and her godparents were her paternal aunt and uncle, Queen Caroline Matilda and King Christian VII of Denmark, and her paternal aunt Louisa. The Duke of Portland, Lord Chamberlain, and the Dowager Countess of Effingham, stood proxy for the King and Queen of Denmark.

Charlotte was officially designated as Princess Royal on 22 June 1789. After the birth of three sons in a row, her parents were delighted to have a daughter in the nursery. Like all of her siblings, Charlotte was inoculated, in her case, in December 1768 along with her brother William. As the eldest daughter of the monarch, Charlotte was assumed to be destined for an important marriage on the continent, and her education was considered to be of the utmost importance, beginning when she was only eighteen months old. Since French was the official language in every European court, the little Princess was given a Frenchwoman to be her tutor, in order that she should have no accent. Her memory was another of her early subjects. She was taught to recite little verses and stories, and as a result had an almost uncanny ability to recall detail for the rest of her life. Her early childhood, however, was not only focused on scholarly pursuits. When she was almost three years old, she took part in her first tableau dressed like Columbine, where she danced with her seven-year-old brother George, Prince of Wales. She was not a naturally musical child and later abhorred such displays of children, declaring that they made children vain and self-important. This did not stop her parents from continuing to show her off. In late 1769, she and the Prince of Wales were once again displayed, this time to the public in a &quot;junior drawing room&quot; in St James&#x27;s Palace. Charlotte was dressed in a Roman toga and lay on a sofa. Though this type of thing was common in German courts, it was considered vulgar in England, where in reaction a London mob drove a hearse into the Palace courtyard. Afterwards, the Prince of Wales told Lady Mary Coke that the whole event had made Charlotte &quot;terribly tired&quot;. Wisely, the King and Queen decided to never repeat the experience.

Though she was the eldest daughter, Charlotte was constantly compared to her sister Augusta Sophia, only two years younger than she. When Augusta was a month old, Lady Mary Coke called her &quot;the most beautiful baby I have ever seen&quot; while Charlotte was &quot;very plain&quot;. Passing judgement once again three years later, Charlotte was now &quot;the most sensible agreeable child I ever saw, but in my opinion far from pretty&quot; while Augusta was still &quot;rather pretty&quot;. Although the Princess Royal was never as beautiful as her younger sister, she did not share in Augusta&#x27;s primary flaw: painful shyness. Charlotte also had a stammer that her attendant Mary Dacres tried to help her young charge manage. In 1770, the cluster of the three eldest princesses was completed with the birth of Princess Elizabeth, the seventh child. For the time being the family remained comparatively small (there were fifteen royal children in all), and Charlotte was fortunate in having parents who preferred spending time with their numerous children to spending all their time at court and took her education seriously. However, given the frequency with which children were being produced and the troubles that plagued George III&#x27;s reign, Charlotte&#x27;s childhood was not as utopian as her parents planned it to be.

Like her siblings, the Princess Royal was educated by tutors and spent most her childhood at Buckingham House, Kew Palace, and Windsor Castle, where her wet nurse was Frances, wife of James Muttlebury.

==Marriage==
On 18 May 1797, the Princess Royal was married at the Chapel Royal, St James&#x27;s Palace, London, to Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Württemberg, the eldest son and heir apparent of Frederick II Eugene, Duke of Württemberg and his wife, Margravine Sophia Dorothea of Brandenburg-Schwedt.

The younger Frederick succeeded his father as the reigning Duke of Württemberg on 23 December 1797. Duke Frederick III had two sons and two daughters by his first marriage to the late Princess Augusta (3 December 1764 – 27 September 1788), the daughter of Duke Karl II of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Princess Augusta of Great Britain (the elder sister of George III) and thus Charlotte&#x27;s first cousin; Princess Augusta was also the mother of Caroline of Brunswick, the estranged wife of the future George IV (then Prince of Wales). The marriage between Duke Frederick and the Princess Royal produced one child: a stillborn daughter on 27 April 1798.

==Württemberg==
In 1800, the French army occupied Württemberg and the Duke and Duchess fled to Vienna. The following year, Duke Frederick concluded a private treaty that ceded Montbéliard to France and brought him Ellwangen in exchange two years later. He assumed the title Elector of Württemberg on 25 February 1803. In exchange for providing France with a large auxiliary force, Napoleon recognized the Elector as King of Württemberg on 26 December 1805. Electress Charlotte became queen when her husband formally ascended the throne on 1 January 1806 and was crowned as such on the same day at Stuttgart, Germany.

Württemberg seceded from the Holy Roman Empire and joined Napoleon&#x27;s Confederation of the Rhine. However, the newly elevated king&#x27;s alliance with France technically made him the enemy of his father-in-law, George III. George III, incensed by his son-in-law&#x27;s assumption of the title and his role as one of Napoleon&#x27;s most devoted vassals, accordingly refused to address his daughter as &quot;Queen of Württemberg&quot; in correspondence. In 1813, King Frederick changed sides and went over to the Allies, where his status as the brother-in-law of the Prince Regent (later George IV) helped his standing. After the fall of Napoleon, he attended the Congress of Vienna and was confirmed as king. He died in October 1816.

==Dowager Queen==

The Dowager Queen of Württemberg continued to live at the Ludwigsburg Palace, near Stuttgart, and received visits from her younger siblings, the Duke of Kent, the Duke of Sussex, the Duke of Cambridge, the Landgravine of Hesse-Homburg, and Princess Augusta Sophia. She was a godmother (by proxy) at the christening of her niece, Princess Victoria of Kent (the future Queen Victoria), in 1819.

In 1827, Charlotte returned to Britain for the first time since her wedding in 1797. By that time, the 60-year-old princess was very heavy and wanted to have surgery for dropsy in England. Steam propulsion had just been introduced on the Rhine, and ensured that the voyage back home would be convenient. On 31 May she embarked on the new steamboat &quot;Friedrich Wilhelm&quot;. After descending the Rhine the steamboat arrived at Bath on the Western Scheldt. Given her weight, Charlotte had to be lifted aboard &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; on a chair that was hoisted. Owing to bad weather, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; then had to leave Bath, and anchor near Vlissingen. On 5 June Charlotte was in Greenwich. In London, she resided at St James&#x27;s Palace, where she received many visits from her family. The king made a final visit from Windsor Castle on 6 October. On Tuesday 9 October Charlotte left England on board &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, but a storm forced her back into Harwich. On the 14th, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; anchored before Klundert on the Hollands Diep. After spending the night on board, Charlotte embarked on the steamboat &quot;Stad Nijmegen&quot;. On 19 October she arrived in Frankfurt, where she met the king and queen of Württemberg and the Duke of Cambridge. On 24 October she was back at Ludwigsburg Palace.

Charlotte died at Ludwigsburg Palace on 6 October 1828 and is buried in its royal vault.

==Honours and arms==
===Honours===
* Royal Family Order of King George IV
* Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Catherine, &quot;5 April 1797&quot;

===Arms===
As a daughter of the sovereign, Charlotte had use of the arms of the kingdom, differenced by a &quot;label argent of three points, the centre point bearing a rose gules, the outer points each bearing a cross gules&quot;.

<doc id="391109" wikidata="Q133802" url="?curid=391109" title="Portlandia (statue)">
<text>Portlandia is a sculpture by Raymond Kaskey located above the entrance of the Portland Building in downtown Portland, Oregon. It is the second largest copper repoussé statue in the United States, after the Statue of Liberty.

==History==
Portlandia was commissioned by the City of Portland in 1985. Sculptor Raymond Kaskey was paid $228,000 in public funds and reportedly an additional $100,000 in private donations.

Kaskey and his assistant Michael Lasell built sections of the statue in a Maryland suburb of Washington, D.C., and sent the parts to Portland by ship. It was assembled at a barge-building facility owned by Gunderson, Inc, and was installed on the Portland Building on October 6, 1985, after being floated up the Willamette River on a barge.

==Description==
The statue is based on the design of the Portland city seal. The statue depicts a female figure, Lady Commerce, dressed in classical clothes, holding a trident in her left hand and reaching down with her right. The statue is above street level and faces a relatively narrow, tree-lined street. 

The statue is high and weighs .

An accompanying plaque includes the official dedication poem, also titled &quot;Portlandia&quot;, written by Portland lawyer and poet Ronald Talney:

==Copyright==
Despite being funded largely by the City’s Public Art Program, Kaskey retained the copyright to the sculpture and has threatened lawsuits against unlicensed depictions of Portlandia. 

The statue appears in the title sequence of the TV series &quot;Portlandia&quot;, the result of &quot;lengthy&quot; negotiations with Kaskey that required the statue not be used &quot;in a disparaging way&quot;. In 2012, Laurelwood Brewing used an illustration of the statue on the label of Portlandia Pils, a beer it introduced; the brewery later found out about Kaskey&#x27;s copyright and reached a cash settlement with Kaskey.

<doc id="391110" wikidata="Q154855" url="?curid=391110" title="Javier Solana">
<text>Francisco Javier Solana de Madariaga CYC (; born 14 July 1942) is a Spanish physicist and PSOE politician. After serving in the Spanish government as Foreign Affairs Minister under Felipe González (1992–1995) and as the Secretary General of NATO (1995–1999), leading the alliance during Operation Allied Force, he was appointed the European Union&#x27;s High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary General of the Council of the European Union and Secretary-General of the Western European Union and held these posts from October 1999 until December 2009.

==Background and career as a physicist==
Solana was born in Madrid, Spain. He comes from a prominent Spanish family, being a first cousin, twice removed, of diplomat, writer, historian, and pacifist Salvador de Madariaga (Javier&#x27;s grandfather, Rogelio de Madariaga and Salvador de Madariaga were cousins). His father was a chemistry professor, Luis Solana San Martín, who died when Javier was nineteen. His mother, Obdulia de Madariaga Pérez, died in 2005. Javier is the third of five children. His older brother Luis was once imprisoned for his political activities opposing the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, subsequently became a distinguished leader in the Spanish telecommunications industry and was one of the first socialist members of the Trilateral Commission.

Solana studied at the Nuestra Señora del Pilar School, an exclusive Catholic Marianist secondary school, before going to Complutense University (UCM). There as a student in 1963 he suffered sanctions imposed by the authorities for having organised an opposition forum at the so-called Week of University Renovation. In 1964 he clandestinely joined the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), which had been illegal under Franco since the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939. In the same year he graduated and then spent a year furthering his studies at Spain&#x27;s Higher Council for Scientific Research (CSIC) and in the United Kingdom.

In 1965 he went to the United States, where he spent six years studying at various universities on a Fulbright Scholarship. He visited the University of Chicago and the University of California, San Diego, and then enrolled in the Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. There, he taught physics classes as a teaching assistant and carried on independent research; he also joined in the protests against the Vietnam War and was president of the Association of Foreign Students. He received his doctorate in physics from Virginia in 1971 with a thesis on &quot;Theory of the Elementary Excitation Spectrum of Superfluid Helium: the Roton Lifetime&quot;, extending his planned stay in the US by a year in order to continue his research. Returning to Spain he became a lecturer in solid-state physics at the Autonomous University of Madrid, UAM, and then in 1975 he became a professor at Complutense University. During these years he published more than 30 articles. For a time he worked as assistant to Nicolás Cabrera, whom he had met when Cabrera was professor at the University of Virginia. The last PhD dissertations that he directed were in the early 1990s.

==Spanish politics==
On returning to Spain in 1971 Solana joined the Democratic Co-ordination of Madrid as the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) representative.

In 1976, during PSOE&#x27;s first national congress inside Spain since the civil war, he was elected Secretary of the party&#x27;s Federal Executive Commission, and also Secretary for Information and Press, remaining in the post for five years. He was a close personal friend of the party&#x27;s leader Felipe González, and is considered one of the PSOE leaders responsible for the transformation of the party in the post-Franco era. In 1976 he represented the PSOE at a Socialist International congress held in Suresnes, France, and again when it was held in Spain in 1977. On 20 May 1977 he accompanied González in visiting King Juan Carlos at the Zarzuela Palace.

He became a representative of a teachers&#x27; union in the Complutense University, and in this role won a parliamentary seat for PSOE on 15 June 1977 and represented the Madrid region until December 1995. On 23 February 1981 he was in the parliament when it was taken over for 18 hours in an attempted coup by gunmen led by Antonio Tejero.

On 28 October 1982 PSOE won a historic victory with 202 out of 350 seats in the lower house. On 3 December, along with the other members of González&#x27;s first cabinet, Solana was sworn in as Minister for Culture, where he remained until moving to the Ministry of Education in 1988. In July 1983 he adhered to the position of Alfonso Guerra calling for an exit of Spain from NATO. On 5 July 1985 he was made the Spokesman for the Government for three years.

He was made Minister for Foreign Affairs on 22 July 1992, the day before the opening of the II Ibero-American conference of heads of state in Madrid, replacing the terminally ill Francisco Fernández Ordóñez. On 27–28 November 1995, while Spain held the Presidency of the Council of the EU, Solana convened and chaired the Barcelona Conference. A treaty was achieved between the twenty-seven nations in attendance with Solana gaining credit for what he called &quot;a process to foster cultural and economic unity in the Mediterranean region&quot;.

It was during these thirteen years as a cabinet minister that Solana&#x27;s reputation as a discreet and diplomatic politician grew. By going to the foreign ministry in the later years of the González administration, he avoided the political scandals of corruption, and of the dirty war allegedly being fought against ETA, that characterised its last years. Towards the end of 1995, Solana – the only surviving member of González&#x27;s original cabinet – was talked about in the press as a possible candidate to replace him and lead the PSOE in the following March elections. Instead, he made the leap to international politics.

During and after his spell as NATO secretary general (see below) Solana continued to play an active role in PSOE and Spanish politics. In June 1997, at the 34th PSOE Congress, Solana left their Executive Commission and joined their Federal Committee, being re-elected in second place three years later. By supporting Colin Powell&#x27;s 5 February 2003 speech to the UN Security Council which claimed that Iraq had WMDs Solana contradicted the position of his party leader José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, who opposed the PP government of José María Aznar&#x27;s support for the invasion of Iraq. Solana is seen, along with González, as representing the older wing of the party. On 15 February 2005 he criticised the Plan Ibarretxe for its position on Basque Country independence, saying that its call for separate Basque representation within the EU had no place within the proposed EU constitution.

==Secretary General of NATO==

On 5 December 1995, Solana became the new Secretary-General of NATO, replacing Willy Claes who had been forced to resign in a corruption scandal. His appointment created controversy as, in the past, he had been an opponent of NATO. He had written a pamphlet called &quot;50 Reasons to say no to NATO&quot;, and had been on a US subversives list. On 30 May 1982 Spain joined NATO. When PSOE came to power later that year, Solana and the party changed their previous anti-NATO positions into an atlanticist, pro-NATO stance. On 12 March 1986 Spain held a referendum on whether to remain in NATO, with the government and Solana successfully campaigning in favour. When criticised about his anti-NATO past, Solana argued that he was happy to be its representative as it had become disassociated from its Cold War origins.
Former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers had been the leading candidate to replace Claes. According to the then-director
of policy planning at the State Department, James Steinberg, Lubbers&#x27; disagreement with the United States regarding NATO expansion caused concern in Washington: “we decided afterward that we weren’t going to let” Lubbers have the job. The United States worked behind the scenes so as not to appear domineering in what is supposed to be an alliance-wide decision. In an attempt to play on French insecurities, Washington highlighted the French-language skills of Solana in comparison to Lubbers, who did not speak French. Sensing American opposition, Lubbers withdrew his candidacy in November 1995, and Solana became Secretary General in December of that year.

Solana immediately had to deal with the Balkans NATO mission Operation &quot;Joint Endeavour&quot; that consisted of a multinational peacekeeping &quot;Implementation Force&quot; (IFOR) of 60,000 soldiers which took over from a United Nations mission on 20 December.
This came about through the Dayton Agreement, after NATO had bombed selected targets in Bosnia and Herzegovina (positions held by VRS) the previous August and September. He did this by deploying the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC). In December 1996 the ARRC was again activated, with IFOR being replaced by a 32,000-strong Stabilisation Force (SFOR) operating under codenames &quot;Joint Guard&quot; and later &quot;Joint Forge&quot;.

During Solana&#x27;s term, NATO reorganised its political and military structure and changed its basic strategies. He gained the reputation of being a very successful, diplomatic Secretary General who was capable of negotiating between the differing NATO members and between NATO and non-NATO States. In December 1995 France partially returned to the military structure of NATO, while in November 1996 Spain joined it. On 27 May 1997, after five months of negotiations with Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov, an agreement was reached resulting in the Paris NATO–Russia Founding Act. On the same day, Solana presided over the establishment of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council to improve relations between European NATO and non-NATO countries.
Keeping the peace in the former Yugoslavia continued to be both difficult and controversial. IFOR and SFOR had received a lot of criticism for their inability to capture the Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić. In late 1998 the conflict in Kosovo, between the Yugoslav authorities and the Kosovar Albanian guerilla Kosovo Liberation Army deteriorated, culminating in the Račak massacre on 15 January 1999, in which 45 Albanians were killed. NATO decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a proper military peacekeeping force under their auspices, to forcibly restrain the two sides. On 30 January 1999, NATO announced that it was prepared to launch air strikes against Yugoslav targets. On 6 February, Solana met both sides for negotiations at the Château de Rambouillet, but they were unsuccessful.

On 24 March, NATO forces launched air attacks on military and civilian targets in Yugoslavia. Solana justified the attacks on humanitarian grounds, and on the responsibility of NATO to keep peace in Europe and to prevent recurrences of ethnic cleansing and genocide similar to those which occurred during the Bosnian War (1992–1995).

Solana and NATO were criticised for the civilian casualties caused by the bombings.
On 23–24 April, the North Atlantic Council met in Washington D.C. where the Heads of State of the member nations agreed with the &quot;New Strategic Concept&quot;, which changed the basic defensive nature of the organisation and allowed for NATO intervention in a greater range of situations than before.

On 10 June, Serbian forces withdrew from Kosovo, and NATO stopped its attacks, which ended the Kosovo War. The same day UN Security Council Resolution 1244 authorised NATO to activate the ARRC, with the Kosovo Force launching Operation &quot;Joint Guardian&quot; and occupying the province on 12 June. Solana left NATO on 6 October 1999, two months ahead of schedule, and was replaced by George Robertson.

==EU foreign policy chief==
After leaving NATO, Solana took up a role in the European Union. Earlier in the year, on 4 June 1999, he was appointed by the Cologne European Council as Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union. An administrative position but it was decided that the Secretary-General would also be appointed High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). In this role he represented the EU abroad where there was an agreed common policy. He took up the post on 18 October 1999, shortly after standing down from NATO. The post has a budget of €40 million, most of which went to Balkan operations. From 25 November 1999 he was also appointed Secretary-General of Western European Union (WEU), overseeing the transfer of responsibilities from that organisation to the CFSP. In 2004 his 5-year mandate was renewed. He also became president of the European Defence Agency.

The Clinton administration claimed in May 2000 that Solana was the fulfilment of Henry Kissinger&#x27;s famous desire to have a phone number to talk to Europe. In December 2003 Solana released the European Security Strategy, which sets out the main priorities and identifies the main threats to the security of the EU, including terrorism. On 25 March 2004 Solana appointed Gijs de Vries as the anti-terrorist co-ordinator for the CFSP, and outlined his duties as being to streamline, organise and co-ordinate the EU&#x27;s fight against terrorism.

On 29 June 2004 he was designated to become the EU&#x27;s first &quot;Union Minister for Foreign Affairs&quot;, a position created by the European Constitutional Treaty combining the head of the CFSP with that of the European Commissioner for External Relations. It would give a single voice to foreign policy and combine the powers and influence of the two posts with a larger budget, more staff and a coherent diplomatic corps. The position (colloquially known as &quot;Mr. Europe&quot;) has been partly maintained in the Reform Treaty as &quot;High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy&quot;, but Solana is not going to take the post as he announced that he would step down at the end of his term.

In late 2004, Solana held secret negotiations with Hamas leaders, saying that he met them at a time when there seemed to be an opportunity for progress, and were to &quot;pass a clear message of what the international community wants&quot;, and said that the meetings occurred &quot;months&quot; before.

===Foreign affairs===

He negotiated numerous Treaties of Association between the European Union and various Middle Eastern and Latin American countries, including Bolivia and Colombia. Solana played a pivotal role in unifying the remainder of the former Yugoslavian federation. He proposed that Montenegro form a union with Serbia instead of having full independence, stating that this was done to avoid a domino effect from Kosovo and Vojvodina independence demands. Local media sarcastically named the new country &quot;Solania&quot;.

On 21 January 2002 Solana said that the detainees at Guantanamo Bay should be treated as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention. The EU has stated that it hopes to avoid another war like the Iraqi invasion through this and future negotiations, and Solana has said the most difficult moments of his job were when the United Kingdom and France, the two permanent EU Security Council members, were in disagreement.

The so-called Vilnius letter, a declaration of support by eastern European countries for the United States&#x27; aim of régime change in Iraq, and the letter of the eight, a similar letter from the UK, Italy, and six second-tier countries, are generally seen as a low-water mark of the CFSP.
Solana has played an important role working toward a resolution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and continues to be a primary architect of the &quot;Road Map for Peace,&quot; along with the UN, Russia, and the United States in the Quartet on the Middle East. On 22 July 2004 he met Ariel Sharon in Israel. Sharon had originally refused to meet Solana, but eventually accepted that, whether he liked it or not, the EU was involved in the Road Map. He criticised Israel for obstructing the Palestinian presidential election of 9 January 2005, but then met Sharon again on 13 January.

In November 2004 Solana assisted the United Kingdom, France and Germany in negotiating a nuclear material enrichment freeze with Iran. In the same month he was involved in mediating between the two presidential candidates in the post-election developments in Ukraine, and on 21 January 2005 he invited Ukraine&#x27;s new President Viktor Yushchenko to discuss future EU membership.

In 2010, after he had left office, Solana signed a petition along with 25 other EU leaders directed at his successor, Catherine Ashton, calling for EU sanctions on Israel in response to continued settlement construction in the West Bank.

<doc id="391121" wikidata="Q4171078" url="?curid=391121" title="Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster">
<text>Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster (27 January 1795 – 31 October 1869), styled The Honourable Richard Grosvenor from 1795 to 1802, Viscount Belgrave from 1802 to 1831 and Earl Grosvenor from 1831 to 1845, was an English politician, landowner, property developer and benefactor.

==Background and education==
Grosvenor was born at Millbank House, Westminster, London, the eldest of the three sons of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster and Lady Eleanor Egerton. He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford where he graduated MA. He undertook the Grand Tour in 1815.

==Political and public life==
In 1818 Grosvenor was elected as Whig MP for Chester and was later appointed as a Justice of the Peace. In 1830 he was elected MP for Cheshire until the constituency was divided in 1832, and from then until 1834 he represented South Cheshire. He was Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire from 1845 to 1867 and Lord Steward of the Household between 1850 and 1852 in the Whig administration headed by Lord John Russell. On 22 March 1850 he was admitted to the Privy Council. He was presented with the Order of the Garter on 6 July 1857. Of his political activity it is said that &quot;he seldom spoke in the House of Lords&quot;.

==Development of the estate==
Grosvenor &quot;devoted himself ... to the improvement of his London property&quot;, and added to his properties in Dorset and Cheshire; he was described as being a &quot;model landlord&quot;. Eaton Hall, Cheshire, had been rebuilt in flamboyant Gothic style for his father by William Porden. Grosvenor commissioned the Scottish architect William Burn to make alterations to it, including raising the centre of the south front to make it look like a tower. Burn also designed Fonthill House, Wiltshire, for him in Scottish Baronial style. On his estates Grosvenor built farms, schools and &quot;numerous&quot; cottages. Among his schools were the Bishopsfield Schools in Hoole, Chester. He also commissioned Shaftesbury Town Hall for the people of the town.

==Personality and personal interests==

Grosvenor continued the family interest in horse racing and, when he was living in the country estate, he spent time hunting and fishing. He gave generously to charity, and built and restored churches. He was an early patron of the Chester architect John Douglas. In 1865–66 Douglas designed St John&#x27;s Church for him in his estate village of Aldford. About the same time, Grosvenor gave fields in Chester to the city council for the formation of Grosvenor Park. For this park Douglas designed a number of items, including the Entrance Lodge, the gates, and a cover for Billy Hobby&#x27;s Well. In 1865 the citizens of Chester began to raise money for the erection of a statue &quot;to mark the public and private worth of his lordship, and the high estimation in which he is held by his neighbours and tenants, as well as by all classes of the community&quot;. Over £5,000 (equivalent to £ as of ) was raised. The statue showing the marquess in his Garter robes was designed by Thomas Thornycroft, and erected in 1869; it still stands in Grosvenor Park.

Grosvenor&#x27;s parents had instilled &quot;high moral principles&quot; in their children, and these stayed with Richard throughout his life. He has been described as &quot;of austere character and unswerving devotion to duty as family man, politician and landlord&quot;. His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; says &quot;he administered his vast estate with a combination of intelligence and generosity not often witnessed&quot;.

==Family==
Lord Westminster married Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower, younger daughter of George Leveson-Gower, 2nd Marquess of Stafford (later 1st Duke of Sutherland), in 1819. Following their marriage, Westminster and his wife initially lived at Eaton Hall, Cheshire, the family&#x27;s country house, with Lord and Lady Grosvenor. During the London season, from April each year, the family lived in Grosvenor House. In 1827 the couple visited Norway, Sweden and Russia and in 1835–36 they toured through Germany and Italy. When the 1st Marquess died in 1845 they followed the family tradition of using Eaton Hall as their country house and Grosvenor House as their London residence, where they entertained lavishly.

Lord Westminster and his wife had thirteen children, ten of whom survived into adulthood and three of whom lived into their nineties. Their second son Hugh Lupus Grosvenor succeeded him as 3rd Marquess; he was later created Duke of Westminster. Their youngest son Lord Richard Grosvenor was ennobled as Baron Stalbridge.

<text>General Sir Alexander Frank Philip Christison, 4th Baronet, (17 November 1893 – 21 December 1993) was a British Army officer who served with distinction during the world wars. After service as a junior officer on the Western Front in the First World War, he later distinguished himself during the Second World War, where he commanded XV Indian Corps, part of Sir William Slim&#x27;s Fourteenth Army, during the Burma campaign. He then went on to have a successful postwar career, and lived to the age of 100.

==Early life and First World War==
Philip Christison was born on 17 November 1893 in Edinburgh, Scotland the eldest son of five children of Sir Alexander Christison, 3rd Baronet and his second wife, Florence. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and University College, Oxford where, as a cadet in the latter&#x27;s Officer Training Corps (OTC), he was made a second lieutenant in March 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War that August.

As with so many others of his generation, the outbreak of war in August 1914 saw Christison volunteering for service with the British Army. Subsequently, he was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant into the 6th (Service) Battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders on 5 September 1914. The battalion, a Kitchener&#x27;s Army unit created from volunteers, formed part of the 45th Brigade of the 15th (Scottish) Division and, after training in the United Kingdom, departed for the Western Front in July 1915. He saw action in the battles of Loos (where he was wounded and awarded the Military Cross), the Somme and Arras. Promoted to lieutenant on 11 February 1917, in July 1917 he was awarded a Bar to his Military Cross. The citation for this award reads:

Promoted to captain on 4 August 1917, three years since the outbreak of war, on 24 October 1918 he was promoted to the acting rank of major, and served as second-in-command (2IC) with the 1/6th Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders, a Territorial Force (TF) unit, part of the 152nd (Seaforth and Cameron) Brigade of the 51st (Highland) Division. The war came to an end soon after, with the signing of the Armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918.

==Between the wars==
In August 1919, he relinquished his last wartime appointment and reverted to the rank of captain, and, by now a Regular Army officer, served with his regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, then serving in Germany as part of the British Army of the Rhine. From 19 April 1920 Christison returned to the United Kingdom and took up the post of adjutant of a Territorial Army (TA) unit.

After vacating his position as adjutant of the 4th Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, another TA unit, in November 1923, Christison was assistant manager of the British Olympic team in Paris in 1924 which was followed by a further appointment as an adjutant, this time with his regiment. Still a captain, he attended the Staff College, Camberley from January 1927 to December 1928. His fellow students there included several who, like Christison, would eventually rise to high command, such as Oliver Leese, John Whiteley, Evelyn Barker, Robert Bridgeman, Eric Dorman-Smith, Ronald Penney and John Hawkesworth. His instructors included the likes of Richard O&#x27;Connor, Bernard Paget, Edwin Morris, Harold Franklyn, Henry Pownall, George Giffard and Bernard Montgomery. Shortly after graduating from Camberley he was appointed as a General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) at the War Office.

Having been promoted to the brevet rank of major on 1 January 1930, a sign of approval and likely future promotion at a time when prospects for promotion in the peacetime army were slow, Christison saw service from 22 January 1931 as the brigade major (a brigade&#x27;s senior staff officer) of the 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s 3rd Brigade, relinquishing the appointment on 20 January 1933. He was promoted to major on 4 November 1933. On 1 January 1934 Christison was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel and returned to the Staff College, Camberley as an instructor (GSO2) where he became good friends with a fellow instructor, William Slim.

On 18 March 1937, Christison, due to a lack of promotion in his own regiment, transferred to the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (DWR) where he received an immediate promotion to lieutenant-colonel, and was appointed Commanding Officer (CO) of the 2nd Battalion, DWR in the Multan area of the Punjab, North-West Frontier Province. On 18 February 1938 he was promoted to colonel and, on the same date, to the temporary rank of brigadier, and was selected to command the Quetta Brigade in India, an unusual posting for a British Army officer.

==Second World War==
Christison remained in command of the brigade until 15 March 1940, over six months since outbreak of the Second World War, when, at the relatively young age of 46, he was made Commandant of the Staff College, Quetta in the former British India (now Pakistan). The length of the course at the college had, in pre-war days, lasted almost two years, but had now been reduced to a relatively brief period of five months, due to the outbreak of war and the urgent need to train large numbers of competent staff officers to fill the increasing number of jobs for the expanding British and Indian Armies.

In May 1941 Christison returned to the United Kingdom and, after serving briefly as a Brigadier General Staff (BGS), on 17 June 1941 was promoted to the acting rank of major-general and became General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, taking over from Major-General Sir Oliver Leese, who had been a fellow student at the Staff College in the late 1920s, and who he would encounter later in the war. The division, with the 44th, 45th and 46th Brigades along with supporting divisional troops under control, was slightly different from that which he had served during the First World War, being a second line TA formation, composed largely of part-time soldiers and, instead of recruiting from all over Scotland, now recruited mainly from the Scottish Lowlands.

Following this, in June 1942, he returned to India, after handing over the 15th Division to Major-General Charles Bullen-Smith. On 5 July 1942 his rank of major-general was made permanent. After a short appointment as a military district commander, he was promoted to the acting rank of lieutenant-general on 12 November 1942 and became GOC of XXXIII Indian Corps. On 1 January 1943 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. His rank of lieutenant-general was made temporary on 12 November 1943. He handed over XXXIII Corps to Lieutenant-General Montagu Stopford in mid-November 1943 and then assumed command of the XV Indian Corps, part of the new Fourteenth Army, succeeding Lieutenant-General William Slim, who he knew from years before as a fellow instructor at the Staff College, and had been promoted to command the Fourteenth Army. The XV Corps made up the Southern Front of the Burma campaign in the coastal region known as the Arakan.

During the Second Arakan Offensive in February 1944, XV Corps advanced southwards. A Japanese attempt to outflank and isolate elements of the Corps failed when the 7th Indian Infantry Division held off the attacks and the Corps&#x27; administrative area–the &quot;Admin Box&quot;–defeated attacks by the Japanese 55th Division in the Battle of the Admin Box. This was the first time in the Second World War that a British army had defeated the Japanese in a land battle. XV Corps was withdrawn on 22 March to participate in the Battle of Imphal. In December 1944 Christison and his fellow corps commanders, Lieutenant-Generals Montagu Stopford and Geoffry Scoones, were knighted and invested as Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire by the viceroy Lord Wavell at a ceremony at Imphal in front of the Scottish, Gurkha and Punjab regiments. Slim was knighted and invested as Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath at the same occasion.

In 1945, Christison assumed temporary command of the Fourteenth Army and also deputised for Slim as Commander of Allied Land Forces, South East Asia when Slim was on leave, reverting to XV Corps on Slim&#x27;s return. Christison led XV Corps into Rangoon in May of that year.

In September 1945 Christison deputised for Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten as commander of South East Asia Command, and took the surrender of the Japanese Seventh Area Army and Japanese South Sea Fleet at Singapore on 3 September. Christison on 29 September 1945 became the Allied Commander of forces in Indonesia. In November, Christison&#x27;s troops were involved in the Battle of Surabaya against pro-Independence Indonesian soldiers and militia in Surabaya. Christison&#x27;s stance on negotiations with the Indonesian nationalists was criticised by the Dutch and eventually at the end of January 1946 he was relieved of his command by Lord Mountbatten. 

==Postwar==
Christison was General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of Northern Command from 1946 to 1947; he was then GOC-in-C of Scottish Command and Governor of Edinburgh Castle from 1947 to 1949 He was promoted to full general in August 1947. He held the honorary appointments of aide-de-camp general to the King (1947 to 1949) and Colonel of his regiment, the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (1947 to 1957). In 1947 Christison was appointed Colonel of the 10th Gurkha Rifles and in late 1949 he was also made Colonel of a Territorial artillery unit.

He retired from the army in 1949 and farmed at Melrose in Scotland. During the 1950s and 1960s he was Secretary of the Scottish Education Department.

Christison married twice: to Betty Mitchell, with whom he had three daughters and a son, from 1916 until her death in 1974; and then to Vida Wallace Smith until her death in 1992. He lived to the age of 100 on 17 November 1993 but died little more than a month later, on 21 December 1993.

==Memorial==
A brass memorial plaque to his memory lies on the south aisle of St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Edinburgh (Episcopal).

<doc id="391141" wikidata="Q107988" url="?curid=391141" title="Basophil">
<text>Basophils are a type of white blood cell. Basophils are the least common type of granulocyte, representing about 0.5% to 1% of circulating white blood cells. They are the largest type of granulocyte. They are responsible for inflammatory reactions during immune response, as well as in the formation of acute and chronic allergic diseases, including anaphylaxis, asthma, atopic dermatitis and hay fever. They also produce compounds that coordinate immune responses, including histamine and serotonin that induce inflammation, and heparin that prevents blood clotting, although there are less than that found in mast cell granules. Mast cells were once thought to be basophils that migrated from the blood into their resident tissues (connective tissue), but they are now known to be different types of cells.

Basophils were discovered in 1879 by German physician Paul Ehrlich, who one year earlier had found a cell type present in tissues that he termed &quot;mastzellen&quot; (now mast cells). Ehrlich received the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries.

The name comes from the fact that these leukocytes are basophilic, i.e., they are susceptible to staining by basic dyes, as shown in the picture.

== Structure ==

Basophils contain large cytoplasmic granules which obscure the cell nucleus under the microscope when stained. However, when unstained, the nucleus is visible and it usually has two lobes. The mast cell, another granulocyte, is similar in appearance and function. Both cell types store histamine, a chemical that is secreted by the cells when stimulated. However, they arise from different branches of hematopoiesis, and mast cells usually do not circulate in the blood stream, but instead are located in connective tissue. Like all circulating granulocytes, basophils can be recruited out of the blood into a tissue when needed.

== Function ==
Basophils appear in many specific kinds of inflammatory reactions, particularly those that cause allergic symptoms. Basophils contain anticoagulant heparin, which prevents blood from clotting too quickly. They also contain the vasodilator histamine, which promotes blood flow to tissues. They can be found in unusually high numbers at sites of ectoparasite infection (e.g., ticks).

Like eosinophils, basophils play a role in both parasitic infections and allergies. They are found in tissues where allergic reactions are occurring and probably contribute to the severity of these reactions. Basophils have protein receptors on their cell surface that bind IgE, an immunoglobulin involved in macroparasite defense and allergy. It is the bound IgE antibody that confers a selective response of these cells to environmental substances (e.g., pollen proteins or helminth antigens).

Recent studies in mice suggest that basophils may also regulate the behavior of T cells and mediate the magnitude of the secondary immune response.

===CD200===
Basophil function is inhibited by CD200. Herpesvirus-6, herpesvirus-7, and herpesvirus-8 produce a CD200 homolog which also inhibits basophil function. This suggests that basophils may play a role in the immune response to these viruses. The role of basophils in the immune response to these viruses is further supported by findings that the CD200 receptor is expressed more frequently in basophils than in other circulating leukocytes.

===Secretions===

Basophils arise and mature in bone marrow. When activated, basophils degranulate to release histamine, proteoglycans (e.g. heparin and chondroitin), and proteolytic enzymes (e.g. elastase and lysophospholipase). They also secrete lipid mediators like leukotrienes (LTD-4), and several cytokines. Histamine and proteoglycans are pre-stored in the cell&#x27;s granules while the other secreted substances are newly generated. Each of these substances contributes to inflammation. Recent evidence suggests that basophils are an important source of the cytokine, interleukin-4, perhaps more important than T cells. Interleukin-4 is considered one of the critical cytokines in the development of allergies and the production of IgE antibody by the immune system. There are other substances that can activate basophils to secrete which suggests that these cells have other roles in inflammation.

The degranulation of basophils can be investigated &quot;in vitro&quot; by using flow cytometry and the so-called basophil-activation-test (BAT). Especially, in the diagnosis of allergies including of drug reactions (e.g. induced by contrast medium), the BAT is of great impact.

Basopenia (a low basophil count) is difficult to demonstrate as the normal basophil count is so low; it has been reported in association with autoimmune urticaria (a chronic itching condition). Basophilia is also uncommon but may be seen in some forms of leukemia or lymphoma.

==Clinical significance==
===Immunophenotyping===
Basophils of mice and humans have consistent immunophenotypes, including FcεRI+, CD123, CD49b(DX-5)+, CD69+, Thy-1.2+, 2B4+, CD11bdull, CD117(c-kit)−, CD24−, CD19−, CD80−, CD14−, CD23−, Ly49c−, CD122−, CD11c−, Gr-1−, NK1.1−, B220−, CD3−, γδTCR−, αβTCR−, α4 and β4-integrin negative.

Recently, Heneberg proposed that basophils may be defined as the cellular population positive for CD13, CD44, CD54, CD63, CD69, CD107a, CD123, CD164, CD193/ CCR3, CD203c, TLR-4, and FcεRI. When activated, some additional surface markers are known to be upregulated (CD13, CD107a, CD164), or surface-exposed (CD63, and the ectoenzyme CD203c).

===Allergy diagnosis===
Basophils are easily isolated from venous blood and present good &quot;indicator cells&quot; of an IgE-mediated allergic response based on the upregulation of activation markers such as CD63 and/or CD203c upon suspect allergen stimulation. Therefore, the BAT serves to confirm IgE-mediated allergy following uncertain results from classical testing based on anamnesis, skin testing or specific IgE results. More recently, BAT has also been used for the monitoring of successful allergen immunotherapy (desensitization) to differentiate short-term desensitization versus sustained unresponsiveness to the allergen.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;basophil&quot; uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, yielding &quot;base-loving&quot;.

<doc id="391149" wikidata="Q376283" url="?curid=391149" title="Mad Season (band)">
<text>Mad Season was an American rock supergroup formed in 1994 as a side project of members of other bands in the Seattle grunge scene. The band&#x27;s principal members included guitarist Mike McCready of Pearl Jam, lead singer Layne Staley of Alice in Chains, drummer Barrett Martin of Screaming Trees, and bassist John Baker Saunders. Mad Season released only one album, &quot;Above&quot;, in March 1995. Its first single, &quot;River of Deceit&quot;, was a radio success, and &quot;Above&quot; was certified a gold record by the RIAA in June.

The band went on a semi-permanent hiatus in 1996 due to the band members&#x27; conflicting schedules and Staley&#x27;s problems with substance abuse. Attempts were made in the late 1990s to revive the group with Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan instead of Staley, and material for a follow-up release to &quot;Above&quot; had been worked on. The band permanently dissolved in 1999 following the death of bassist John Baker Saunders from a drug overdose. Staley would also die from an overdose three years later. Martin and McCready have since made two short partial reunions, one in 2012 and one from 2014 to 2015. A special edition box set containing a remastered edition of &quot;Above&quot; and various unreleased material was released in March 2013.

==History==

===Career beginnings (1994-1995)===
During the production of 1994&#x27;s &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready went into drug and alcohol rehab at the Hazelden Clinic in Minnesota, where he met bassist John Baker Saunders. In 1994, when the two returned to Seattle, Washington, they formed a side band with drummer Barrett Martin. McCready played in bands such as Pearl Jam and Temple of the Dog, Martin with Skin Yard and the Screaming Trees and Saunders with blues talents such as Little Pat Rushing, Hubert Sumlin, Sammy Fender, and The Lamont Cranston Band. Immediately the trio set up rehearsal time together and wrote the music for two songs that would later become Mad Season&#x27;s &quot;Wake Up&quot; and &quot;River of Deceit&quot;, both of which would later appear on the band&#x27;s album &quot;Above&quot;. McCready then brought in friend and Alice in Chains frontman Layne Staley to round out the line-up. McCready had hoped that being around sober musicians would push Staley to get himself sober.

Despite not having a single song completely prepared (only beginnings of songs, according to Martin) and not even having a name for the band, McCready scheduled an unannounced show at the Crocodile Cafe on October 12, 1994, which was a big success. The song &quot;Artificial Red&quot;, which was also to appear on the album, actually came together during the show itself. Two more gigs were scheduled (November 6 &amp; 20, 1994) at the same venue, with the band calling itself The Gacy Bunch, after both the notorious serial killer John Wayne Gacy of Chicago and the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch. On January 8, 1995, the band made an appearance on Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Self-Pollution&quot; satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour-long pirate broadcast out of Seattle which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it, performing &quot;Lifeless Dead&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Anything&quot;.

===&quot;Above&quot; (1995)===
After gaining more popularity, the band recorded its only album and changed its name to Mad Season, which is an English term for the time of the year when psilocybin mushrooms are in full bloom, and a term which McCready related to &quot;the seasons of drinking and drug abuse.&quot; The album, &quot;Above&quot;, which was recorded in Seattle, Washington at Bad Animals Studio (co-owned by Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart) and co-produced by the band and Pearl Jam sound engineer Brett Eliason, featured ten songs. It also included guest vocals and additional lyrics by Screaming Trees frontman and solo artist Mark Lanegan. McCready said, &quot;We did all the Mad Season music in about seven days. It took Layne just a few more days to finish his vocals, which was intense since we only rehearsed twice and did four shows.&quot; The album was released on March 14, 1995, through Columbia Records to critical and commercial success. Over the course of 1995, &quot;Above&quot; scaled the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, eventually peaking at No. 24 and spawning two singles: &quot;River of Deceit&quot; (#2 Mainstream Rock Tracks, No. 9 Modern Rock Tracks) and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Anything&quot; (#20 Mainstream Rock Tracks). &quot;Above&quot; was certified gold on June 14, 1995.

===Dormancy, Disinformation, and dissolution (1996-1999)===
The band continued to play shows during the spring of 1995 before going on hiatus so that the members could return to work with their main bands. During this time the band released the &quot;Live at the Moore&quot; concert film, which was a live performance recorded at Seattle&#x27;s Moore Theatre on April 29, 1995. Also, during this time the band contributed a cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Be a Soldier&quot; to the 1995 John Lennon tribute album, &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;. In 1996, a live version of &quot;River of Deceit&quot; surfaced on the &quot;Bite Back: Live at Crocodile Cafe&quot; compilation album, although by this time Mad Season had long been dormant from live work as McCready and Martin went back to work with their respective bands and Saunders joined The Walkabouts.

In 1997, attempts were made by McCready, Saunders and Martin to revive Mad Season, although by this point Staley&#x27;s health had worsened due to severe drug addiction; he would never perform again after a July 1996 Alice in Chains show. As a result, Mad Season was without a singer. With Staley now out of the picture, the band recruited vocalist Mark Lanegan (of the Screaming Trees), who had previously guested on the &quot;Above&quot; album (as well as at live shows) as its new permanent singer. With the switch in frontmen the group also switched names adopting the Disinformation moniker in late 1997.

Work reportedly began in 1998 on what would have been Disinformation&#x27;s debut album, although between everyone&#x27;s busy schedules, it became difficult to meet in the studio together. Over the course of the year the quartet gradually grew apart, making a Disinformation album all the more unlikely. Another critical blow was dealt to the project in January 1999 with the death of bassist John Baker Saunders from an overdose of heroin. Although no official announcement by the band was ever given, Staley confirmed in July 1999 (during an Alice in Chains interview) that the group had disbanded.

===Post-breakup===
Following Saunders&#x27; death, McCready returned to working and touring with Pearl Jam and also later formed a new side project, The Rockfords. Martin briefly returned to work with Screaming Trees before the band disbanded in 2000. Since then Martin has worked as an occasional touring drummer for R.E.M. and performs with R.E.M guitarist Peter Buck in the band Tuatara. Staley briefly reunited with Alice in Chains in the late 1990s before dropping out of the public eye permanently. His body was later found on April 19, 2002, in his condominium, the victim of an apparent overdose of cocaine and heroin about two weeks prior. Lanegan went on to a relatively successful solo career, worked with Queens of the Stone Age, and performed with Isobel Campbell on the 2006 Mercury Prize nominated album, &quot;Ballad of the Broken Seas&quot;, and as part of a duo with Greg Dulli under the name The Gutter Twins.

On February 28, 2010, McCready performed at the &quot;Hootenanny For Haiti&quot; at the Showbox at the Market in Seattle along with the likes of Velvet Revolver, Loaded and former Guns N&#x27; Roses bassist Duff McKagan, Fastbacks bassist Kim Warnick, and former Alien Crime Syndicate, Sirens Sister and Vendetta Red bassist Jeff Rouse as well as Truly and former Screaming Trees drummer Mark Pickerel among others. A number of songs were covered during the show, including Belinda Carlisle&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot;, Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;, and the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; among others however one of the more notable moments came when McCready performed &quot;River of Deceit&quot; for the first time since the breakup of Mad Season with Jeff Rouse performing vocal duties on the song.

===Partial reunion===
On May 23, 2012, the surviving members of Mad Season (Mike McCready and Barrett Martin) reunited at the Showbox Theatre in Seattle for Mike&#x27;s annual benefit concert for Crohn&#x27;s disease. They were joined by Loaded singer Jeff Rouse and The Rockfords bassist Rick Friel.

In 2012, Martin, McCready and McKagan, along with singer Jeff Angell and keyboardist Benjamin Anderson collaborated on an album called &quot;Walking Papers&quot;. Spurred by this collaboration, Martin, McCready and McKagan revisited the unreleased Mad Season material. In July 2012, Martin confirmed that Mark Lanegan would be singing several songs on a new Mad Season release.

In October 2012, Barrett Martin announced a Mad Season box set:

Legacy Recordings released an expanded deluxe edition of &quot;Above&quot; in April 2013. A three-disc boxset comprising two CDs and one DVD, it includes a digitally remastered version of the studio album, the John Lennon cover &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Be a Soldier&quot;, some unreleased tracks from the band&#x27;s unfinished second album with lyrics and vocals by Mark Lanegan, the band&#x27;s &quot;Live at the Moore&quot; performance on April 29, 1995, on CD, DVD, and vinyl, and a previously unreleased full concert video of the band&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve performance from the now-defunct Seattle club RKCNDY as well as video of the band&#x27;s performance from the &quot;Self-Pollution&quot; radio broadcast.

Mad Season reunited again for a special concert titled &quot;Sonic Evolution&quot; with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra on January 30, 2015, at Benaroya Hall in Seattle. At this show, Chris Cornell filled in for Staley on vocals, and McKagan filled in for Saunders on bass. Kim Virant of Lazy Susan and Jeff Angell of Walking Papers also provided vocals at the gig. The concert was recorded for the live album Mad Season &amp; The Seattle Symphony - &quot;Sonic Evolution / January 30, 2015 / Benaroya Hall&quot; and was released August 28, 2015. The album debuted at number four on the Billboard Top Classical Crossover Albums chart.

===New material===
In July 2015, Martin announced on Facebook that he was recording new Mad Season material with McCready and McKagan. The fruits of the collaboration resulted in a project called The Levee Walkers, which released the songs &quot;Freedom Song&quot; and &quot;Tears for the West&quot; in 2016 with singer Jaz Coleman and the song &quot;All Things Fade Away&quot; in 2017 with singer Ayron Jones.

==Musical style==

McCready described the songs on the band&#x27;s only album, &quot;Above&quot;, as &quot;some jazzy stuff, some blues, some arena rock.&quot; Before his review was revised, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that the album &quot;sounds like a cross between Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam, taking the ponderous seriousness of Alice and PJ&#x27;s &#x27;90s update of winding &#x27;70s guitar rock.&quot; Staley&#x27;s lyrics dealt with his personal troubles, with Martin saying, &quot;Layne Staley felt as though he was on a spiritual mission through his music.&quot; During the lyric writing process, Staley was reading the book &quot;The Prophet&quot; by Kahlil Gibran, which was a strong influence on the lyrics and the overall tone of the album. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Anything&quot; is a heavier, blues-influenced track, while &quot;Long Gone Day&quot; takes considerable jazz influence, combining the use of samba-style bass, xylophone, and saxophone.

Staley is credited for writing all the lyrics on the original release within the liner notes of the 2013 deluxe issue. As was the case with much of his work with Alice in Chains, Staley&#x27;s lyrics dealt with his struggle against addiction as well as other personal troubles. Lyrically, much of &quot;River of Deceit&quot; was inspired by Khalil Gibran&#x27;s &quot;The Prophet&quot;. Vocalist Mark Lanegan of Screaming Trees contributes guest vocals on &quot;I&#x27;m Above&quot; and &quot;Long Gone Day&quot;; he is also credited for co-writing the music to those tracks along with McCready and Martin. Lanegan also wrote the lyrics for the three bonus tracks on Disc 1 of the deluxe issue - &quot;Locomotive&quot;, &quot;Black Book of Fear&quot;, and &quot;Slip Away&quot;. R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck is credited for co-writing the music to &quot;Black Book of Fear&quot; along with McCready, Martin, Saunders, and Lanegan.

<text>Actons Corners is a community in the municipality of North Grenville, United Counties of Leeds and Grenville, in eastern Ontario, Canada. An unincorporated place and compact rural community, it is located on County Road 43 (formerly provincial Highway 43) between Kemptville and Merrickville at the intersection with Actons Corners Road (north to the Rideau River) and County Road 25 (south to Oxford Mills).

Except for an historic stone church built in the late 19th century, the North Grenville Archives, and a brickyard, the area consists mainly of farms and homes set in a mixture of farmland and cedar forest.

Addresses in the community are either listed as RR #1, Oxford Mills or RR #5, Kemptville.

==History==
The intersection was created between Lots 15 and 16 of Concessions 2 and 3 of Oxford Township in the early 19th century and was originally named Bobtown, with only a Blacksmith&#x27;s shop in the area. In the late 1820s, Robert Acton (for whom the community is named) and his family arrived from West Connaught, Ireland, and settled on Lot 16, Concession 3. Robert&#x27;s son, John Acton, was a capable shoemaker, but worked on the Rideau Canal as a stonemason and later constructed several buildings in the township including the grist mill at Oxford Mills and the stone house at Actons Corners that replaced the family&#x27;s original log dwelling.

At its height, Actons Corners boasted a post office, a school, two churches, a cheese factory, and an Orange Hall.

The post office operated between the 1890s and 1912, when it was replaced by rural mail delivery from Kemptville. A stone school was first opened in 1858 to replace two log schools to the east and west of the village. In 1905 the school was demolished and replaced with a new stone building which became the North Grenville Archives in 1998. A white-framed Methodist Church was constructed in 1875 and a stone Anglican church, St. Augustine, was built in 1879. The Methodist church was sold and removed in 1963, while the Anglican church remains standing, though it has been deconsecrated and is now privately owned. Scott&#x27;s Cheese Factory was built in 1886 and operated until 1948. The Orange Hall served as a community centre until it was closed and the building sold and moved in the late 1930s.

<doc id="391154" wikidata="Q2292767" url="?curid=391154" title="Glinda">
<text>Glinda is a fictional character created by L. Frank Baum for his &quot;Oz&quot; novels. She first appears in Baum&#x27;s 1900 children&#x27;s classic &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, and is the most powerful sorceress in the Land of Oz, ruler of the Quadling Country South of the Emerald City, and protector of Princess Ozma.
==Inspiration==
Baum spent a great deal of time with his mother-in-law, activist Matilda Joslyn Gage, who encouraged him to write down his Oz stories. Baum&#x27;s biographers have drawn correlations between Baum&#x27;s &quot;Good Witch&quot; and Gage&#x27;s feminist writings.

==Literature==
===L. Frank Baum===
Baum&#x27;s 1900 children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; refers to Glinda as the &quot;Good Witch of the South&quot;; she does not appear in the novel until late in its storyline. After the Wizard flies away in his balloon, the Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, Dorothy, and Toto travel South to the land of the Quadlings to ask Glinda for her advice. Glinda tells Dorothy of how she can return home to Kansas using the Silver Shoes, and frees the Winged Monkeys by giving them the Golden Cap that controls them, after having them escort Dorothy&#x27;s three companions safely from Quadling Country. In the 1939 film, Glinda is a composite character with the Witch of the North. Later books call her a &quot;Sorceress&quot; rather than a &quot;witch&quot;, though Baum&#x27;s writings make clear that he did not view witches as inherently wicked.

In the books, Glinda is depicted as a beautiful young woman with long, rich rare red hair and blue eyes, wearing a pure white dress. She is much older than her appearance would suggest, but &quot;knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived&quot;—a fact that is established in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, by the Soldier with the Green Whiskers. She has ruled the Quadling Country ever since she overthrew the Wicked Witch of the South during the period when Ozma&#x27;s grandfather was king of Oz.

Glinda plays the most active role in finding and restoring Princess Ozma, the rightful heir, to the throne of Oz, the search for whom takes place in the second book, &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, although Glinda had been searching for Ozma ever since the princess disappeared as a baby. It may well be that she did not overthrow the Wicked Witches of the East and West, despite being more powerful than they were, because she wanted all of Oz to be unified under its rightful ruler, Ozma, first. After Ozma&#x27;s ascent to the throne, Glinda continues to help the Princess of Oz shape the future of the Land of Oz as a whole, no longer confining her powers to guarding her Quadling Kingdom in the South alone; true to her character, Glinda does not interfere in affairs of State unless Ozma seeks her counsel or help specifically.

In addition to her vast knowledge of magic, Glinda employs various tools, charms, and instruments in her workshop. &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; reveals that she owns a Great Book of Records that allows her to track everything that goes on in the world from the instant it happens. Starting with &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; she trains the formerly humbug Wizard in magic; he becomes a formidable practitioner, but acknowledges that she is more powerful yet.

Glinda lives in a palace near the Deadly Desert in the far south of the Quadling Country, attended by fifty beautiful maidens from each country of Oz. She also employs a large army of female soldiers, with which she takes on General Jinjur&#x27;s Army of Revolt, who had conquered the Emerald City in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;. Men are not prominent in Glinda&#x27;s court.

Glinda is strongly protective of her subjects in the South. She creates walled, gated communities for the rabbits of Bunnybury and the paper dolls of Miss Cuttenclip, showing a personal interest in the concerns of not only the humanoid Quadlings, but also the other inhabitants of her jurisdiction.

In &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;, when Ozma goes to consult Glinda about the security of her Ozian citizens, the Sorceress seals off all of Oz from the Great Outside World, making Oz invisible to the eyes of mortals flying overhead in airplanes and such. However, unlike Ozma, Glinda is willing to ignore strife and oppression in remote corners of Oz like Jinxland and the Skeezer territory as long as it does not threaten the Emerald City or innocent outsiders. The readers are left with the sense that Glinda is experienced and seasoned to the point of knowing that there is not a magic cure for everything, and that certain things cannot be changed or perhaps should not be changed for better or for worse.

One of the more obscure facts about Glinda is that she created the Forbidden Fountain with the Waters of Oblivion, at the center of Oz, whose waters redeemed a former King of Oz who was exceptionally cruel. This happened &quot;many centuries ago&quot; according to Ozma (again alluding to Glinda&#x27;s advanced age), and it is this fountain that saves Oz from the invading Nome King and his allies in &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;, by making them forget their nefarious intentions. Glinda clearly made the Fountain at a point in Oz&#x27;s history when the Land was unified under one of the members of the Royal Family of Oz, albeit a tyrannical king in this isolated incident, and so she was able to intervene in a way that she could not when the country was divided between the Wizard and the Wicked Witches of the East and West et al., prior to Dorothy&#x27;s arrival.

Most intriguingly, in &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;, when the Nome King considers invading Oz, he is told by a minion, General Guph, that Glinda the Good&#x27;s castle is located &quot;at the North of the Emerald City,&quot; when it has been established that Glinda rules the South, while another Witch (the one who welcomed Dorothy to Oz, and was retroactively named Tattypoo) reigned in the North. Guph may have gotten his facts muddled, as none of the Gnomes had been to Oz at that time, but it portends the depiction of Glinda as the Good Witch of the North rather than the South in the 1939 MGM film (which is the most widely known version of Oz to date).

General Guph also tells the Nome King that Glinda &quot;commands the spirits of the air&quot;. As mentioned above, he is not an expert on Oz, but this statement made by Guph once again foreshadows a much later cinematic rendition of Glinda, in the film version of the Broadway musical &quot;The Wiz&quot; in which Glinda (played by Lena Horne) and the original (played by Billie Burke) is responsible for the twister that brings Dorothy&#x27;s house to Oz and sets all subsequent events into motion.

Of all the characters in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Oz, Glinda is the most enigmatic. Despite being titled &quot;Glinda the Good,&quot; she is not a one-dimensional caricature whose sole purpose is to embody and generate all that is generically considered &quot;good,&quot; as indicated above.

She ultimately becomes the adult anchor in the Oz books, because she is never distracted or swayed, and always maintains absolute firmness of purpose—something that cannot be said for the other adult characters in the series such as the Wizard and the Shaggy Man or even the Good Witch of the North. They all fall short of Glinda&#x27;s wisdom and resoluteness.

In Baum&#x27;s final book, &quot;Glinda of Oz&quot;, we learn that Glinda resides in a castle with one hundred of the most beautiful women in Oz at her beck and call.

In Alexander Volkov&#x27;s Magic Land series, the witch is called Stella and appears very rarely. However, she is often referred to by the author and the characters and always offers people help or refuge during hard times. She is described as a golden-haired eternally young beauty in a pink dress. She rules the Pink Country which is inhabited by the tribe of Chatterboxes. She seems to be a good friend of the Winged Monkeys ever since releasing them.

In Philip Jose Farmer&#x27;s novel &quot;A Barnstormer in Oz&quot;, Glinda is portrayed as young and beautiful enough to attract the protagonist, though the interest is not mutual.

===&quot;Wicked&quot; (novel)===
In Gregory Maguire&#x27;s 1995 revisionist novel &quot;Wicked&quot;, she is initially called &quot;Galinda&quot;, and (through her mother) is descended from the noble clan of the Arduennas of the Upland. Her character is seen extensively in the first half of the novel, but disappears for most of the second half, compared to her musical counterpart.

Though originally snobbish and superficial, she is also intelligent enough to be accepted to Shiz University&#x27;s Crage Hall, where she is assigned to share a room with Elphaba. After a long period of mutual loathing, the two girls later become close friends.

Galinda removes the first &#x27;a&#x27; in her name in the middle of the story, in tribute to Dr. Dillamond, a martyred Goat who taught at Shiz (Dillamond made the habitual mistake of calling her &quot;Glinda&quot; instead of &quot;Galinda&quot; while they shared a carriage, before her arrival to the university). The Goat&#x27;s death also prompts Glinda to re-evaluate her life, and she dedicates herself to studying sorcery, at which she proves to be quite skilled.

It is stated that she marries Sir Chuffrey in the second half of the novel, and they have no children. She initially dislikes Elphaba&#x27;s sister Nessarose (who goes on to become the Wicked Witch of the East), but becomes close to her after Elphaba leaves Shiz, and enchants the Silver Shoes that enable Nessarose to walk without any assistance.

As in the original Oz books, she is revered as a powerful sorceress. Maguire follows the 1939 movie in having Glinda ultimately become the Witch of the North, not the South. Glinda also appears in &quot;Son of a Witch&quot;, Maguire&#x27;s sequel to &quot;Wicked&quot;, now widowed from Sir Chuffrey.

==Films and TV==

=== &quot;The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays&quot; (1908) ===
In &quot;The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays&quot;, Glinda was portrayed by Evelyn Judson. She was played by Olive Cox in the 1910 version of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. In the latter, she appears in one scene in which she enlarges Toto to make him a better protector for Dorothy.

===&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939)===

In the 1939 film version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Glinda is the Good Witch of the North. She is played in the film by Billie Burke. Glinda performs the functions of not only the novel&#x27;s Good Witch of the North and Good Witch of the South, but also the novel&#x27;s Queen of Field Mice, by being the one who welcomes Dorothy to Oz, sends her &quot;off to see the Wizard,&quot; and orchestrates her rescue from the deadly poppy field in addition to revealing the secret to going back home.

Like Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, who do not have Oz counterparts, Glinda does not have a sepia-tone Kansas counterpart.
However, when performed on stage, the actress playing Aunt Em will sometimes also play Glinda.

=== &quot;The Wonderful Land of Oz&quot; (1969) ===
In &quot;The Wonderful Land of Oz&quot;, Glinda is played by Hilary Lee Gaess; her singing voice was dubbed. She is portrayed as much younger than the Billie Burke incarnation, although her pink costume/gown is similar. She sings 2 stirring solos titled &quot;Try To Touch a Star&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Watched Over You.&quot; In the latter song, she makes the touching and astute observation that the Scarecrow possesses not only a brain, but also a heart (at least metaphorically).

She is able to summon the powers of &quot;all the good fairies&quot; when restoring Princess Ozma to her rightful form, almost making her equal to L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Queen Lurline (whereas Baum&#x27;s Glinda is a stately sorceress showing no association with fairy magic or &quot;unscrupulous&quot; witchcraft, insisting that the witch Mombi herself disenchant Ozma unlike in this film). Apart from undoing Mombi&#x27;s evil magic herself, this incarnation of Glinda also tells the old Gillikin witch that she has &quot;allowed&quot; her to practice some of her &quot;less horrible tricks&quot; thus far, suggesting that every practitioner of magic in Oz is ultimately answerable to Glinda should they go too far.

===&quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot; (1972)===
In &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot;, the unofficial sequel to the 1939 film, operatic mezzo-soprano Risë Stevens provides the voice of &quot;Glinda, the Good Fairy&quot; as she is described in the opening title sequence (however, the Cowardly Lion refers to her as the Good Witch of the North later in the film). In L. Frank Baum&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot;, the Wizard says: &quot;Ozma is a fairy, and so is Glinda, so no power can kill or destroy them, but you girls are all mortals and so are Button-Bright and I, so we must watch out for ourselves.&quot; However, the only fact established by this statement is that Glinda is one of Oz&#x27;s &quot;fairy people&quot; (L. Frank Baum&#x27;s term for anyone native to an enchanted land) rather than a Fairy proper. Even the citizens of Oz who do not possess magical powers are referred to as &quot;fairy people&quot; by Baum in &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;, meaning that they are not mortals like Dorothy and the Wizard who were born in the outside world.

In this film, it is revealed that this Glinda&#x27;s magic is no match for Mombi&#x27;s (the exact opposite was true in Baum&#x27;s original books). Still, she helps Dorothy confront Mombi and her army of green elephants in a way that evokes the help offered by the Queen of Field Mice in Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Land of Oz&quot;. She sings a climactic song called &quot;You Have Only You (To Look To)&quot; to Dorothy, making her look inside herself for the strength that is not forthcoming from old companions such as the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion. In this regard, Glinda reveals how in touch she is with stark reality, a trait that hearkens back to Baum&#x27;s original Glinda.

At the end of the film, she sends Dorothy back to Kansas by conjuring up another tornado. This too is in keeping with L. Frank Baum&#x27;s original Glinda, who had the power to &quot;command the spirits of the air&quot; according to &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;.

=== &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1982) ===
In the 1982 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Glinda, looking very young and with long blonde hair, voiced by Wendy Thatcher, claims to be the sister of the Good Witch of the North despite the appearance of quite a large age gap (Baum did always say she is much older than she looks), and appears in the Emerald City in a deus ex machina similar to the MGM film.

=== &quot;Return to Oz&quot; (1985) ===
Glinda appears in &quot;Return to Oz&quot;. She is seen in the background at the coronation of Princess Ozma.

===&quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1986)===
In Panmedia&#x27;s 1986 animated series, Glinda is portrayed as a tall and very slender sorceress with long blue hair. It is she who offers to make Dorothy a Princess of Oz in this series, during their very first encounter, but Dorothy maintains that she wishes to return to Kansas.

In Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Land of Oz&quot;, Glinda categorically states that she does not engage in &quot;transformations&quot; because &quot;they are not real&quot;, but in this series, the Good Witch transforms into an eagle in order to pursue Mombi, who attempts to fly away from the Emerald City in the form of a dragon.

After restoring Princess Ozma to the throne, Glinda uses her magic on Mombi and Jinjur to &quot;make&quot; them reform, when the witch and the rebel queen refuse to mend their villainous ways. Having thus changed Mombi and Jinjur&#x27;s inherent natures, Glinda ensures that they will never create trouble for anyone again.

Glinda entrusts Dorothy with the task of preparing Ozma for her official coronation ceremony, confident that the maturer Dorothy will mould the series&#x27; playful young Ozma into a responsible queen. As the series draws to an end, Glinda telepathically contacts and saves Dorothy from falling to her death from a tower, following a confrontation with the Nome King and his minions.

===&quot;DiC&#x27;s The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1990)===
Glinda appears in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; voiced by B.J. Ward. Glinda&#x27;s portrayal in this short-lived series is much more in keeping with the 1939 MGM film, although the character looks significantly younger than Billie Burke did, wears a white gown with pink embroidery (rather than a wholly pink gown), and has blonde hair. However, her voice and her personality are extremely close to the 1939 version of this Oz character. She arranges for Dorothy to return to the Land of Oz by means of the Ruby Slippers, because the Wicked Witch of the West has been brought back to life, and Glinda needs Dorothy&#x27;s help to set things right again.

===&quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990)===
Actress Sheryl Lee portrays a version of the Good Witch, who appears in a hallucination to Nicolas Cage&#x27;s character, Sailor Ripley, in David Lynch&#x27;s 1990 black comedy thriller &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;. Glinda persuades Sailor to return to Lula Fortune (Laura Dern), his lover, and Pace, his six-year-old son during an hallucinatory conversation with her near the end of the film.

===&quot;The Oz Kids&quot; (1996)===
In &quot;The Oz Kids&quot;, Glinda becomes a mother and has a daughter Andrea. Voiced by Erika Schickel. Her daughter Andrea has a dress similar to Princess Ozma&#x27;s.

===&quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot; (2005)===
In &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot;, Glinda is the Good Witch of the South and is played by Miss Piggy, as are her sisters the Good Witch of the North and the two Wicked Witches. In keeping with the traditions of Muppet films, she is attracted to the Scarecrow (played by Kermit the Frog). She is portrayed in a lavender dress with a feather boa, an archetypal Hollywood starlet much more in keeping with the character of Miss Piggy rather than Glinda. Miss Piggy&#x27;s other role is herself. Prior to Dorothy&#x27;s journey, she appears with Kermit and tries to get rid of Dorothy. After Dorothy&#x27;s journey, she returns for the Muppets&#x27; show.

===&quot;Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz&quot; (2011)===
Frances Conroy voices Glinda in &quot;Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz&quot; in 2016.

===&quot;Supernatural&quot; (2013)===
In the &quot;LARP and the Real Girl&quot; an episode of season 8 of &quot;Supernatural&quot; appears a fairy based in Glinda called Gilda. She describes herself as the good kind of fairy and is portrayed by Tiffany Dupont.

===&quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot; (2013)===

Glinda is portrayed by Michelle Williams in the 2013 Disney film &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;. In this prequel, she is Glinda the Good Witch of the South as well as the daughter of the slain king of Oz. Theodora (Mila Kunis) and Evanora (Rachel Weisz), are the future Wicked Witches of the West and East, respectively. In the film, she helps a good-hearted con artist named Oscar Diggs (James Franco) defeat the sisters and become the Wizard of Oz.

===&quot;Legends of Oz: Dorothy&#x27;s Return&quot; (2013)===
Glinda was voiced by Bernadette Peters in the 3D animated film &quot;Legends of Oz: Dorothy&#x27;s Return&quot;, which was released in 2014.

===&quot;RWBY&quot; (2013)===
In the American 3D anime &quot;RWBY&quot;, Glinda the Good Witch is represented by Glynda Goodwitch, a skilled Huntress with telekinetic abilities. Unlike her inspiration, Goodwitch, voiced by Kathleen Zuelch, possesses a noticeably short temper. Goodwitch serves as the right-hand associate of Professor Ozpin (whose likeness alludes to the Wizard of Oz) and plays an integral part in training the students of Beacon Academy to protect the world from evil forces.

===&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; (2014)===

Glinda appears in the second half of Season 3 of &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; played by Sunny Mabrey. In a sisterhood of witches, Glinda, the Witch of the South, along with the Witch of the East (Sharon Taylor) and the Witch of the North (Karen Holness), protect Oz with each of their magic affinities. Only the 4th seat of the sisterhood—representing innocence—remains empty, but through Glinda&#x27;s guardianship of the Book of Records, a prophecy foretells of a sorceress coming to Oz via a cyclone to join them. Secondly, the book also states this witch will &quot;unseat the greatest evil the realm has ever seen&quot;. After seeing Zelena (Rebecca Mader) punish the deceitful Walsh/Wizard of Oz (Christopher Gorham), Glinda believes this woman, who arrived to Oz many years ago from a cyclone, will fulfill the prophecy. Though Zelena is more interested in changing her past, Glinda convinces the unsure redhead that her destiny lies in changing her own future by becoming a good witch, however, she does not tell Zelena about the second part of the prophecy. From joining the sisterhood, she gifts Zelena a pendant to harness her powers. While showing Zelena the western area of Oz, they approach wreckage from a cyclone and take in a girl, Dorothy Gale (Matreya Scarrwener). Zelena, from reading the Book of Records, believes Dorothy will become the Witch of the West and defeat her. Glinda doesn&#x27;t believe this to be true, but she witnesses Zelena attack Dorothy, who causes her assailant to melt with water. Realizing the prophecy was right, Glinda offers Dorothy a place with the sisterhood, but the latter wishes to go home. With Zelena defeated, the Wizard reverts to his old self and thus Glinda helps her to return home with his assistance. Only after, Zelena reveals she masqueraded as the Wizard to get rid of Dorothy. Glinda vows to find another sorceress to fulfill the prophecy, but Zelena banishes her to the Enchanted Forest. In this new realm, she begins living in the north of woods, south of Rumpelstiltskin&#x27;s (Robert Carlyle) castle, hidden in a pocket dimension of ice and snow, which only the pure of heart may enter through.

Sensing the incoming presence of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) crossing into her realm, Glinda makes herself known to them. When Snow White asks for Regina&#x27;s whereabouts since she was just with them, Glinda states that the Queen didn&#x27;t meet the qualifications needed for entering through the door. The banished Good Witch briefly explains her past friendship with Zelena and tells them the Wicked Witch&#x27;s greatest weakness is light magic. Recalling that her own daughter, Emma, is a product of the strongest magic of all—true love, Snow White believes she may be able to defeat Zelena. Glinda agrees with this sentiment; further prompting Snow White to go through with casting another Dark Curse to send everyone back to Storybrooke.

=== &quot;Emerald City&quot; (2015) ===
Glinda appears in the first season of &quot;Emerald City&quot;, portrayed by Joely Richardson (based on both the characters of Glinda the Good Witch and the Good Witch of the North from the L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Oz Books). The Mistress of the North &quot;Maiden of the Northern Light, Mother of the Sound and Pure&quot; and one of the last Cardinal Witches of Oz, Glinda is an authoritative woman who has had a deep-seated hatred towards the Wizard (Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio) ever since he outlawed magic. Since the change of regime in Oz, Glinda also runs a boarding house for orphaned girls where she oversees their education and chooses the best of them to join the Wizard&#x27;s High Council. It is revealed that she in fact conspires against the Wizard&#x27;s rule and prepares to overthrow him, using the Wizard&#x27;s councilwomen as spies and aiming to use the secretly raised young witches for war.

&quot;Emerald City&quot; also has another witch half based on the Witch of the South, named Mother South, that is a cardinal witch together with her daughters Glinda, West and East. Mother South gave birth to all of the witches in Oz, over a thousand years ago.

=== &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot; (2017) ===
Glinda appears in the cartoon series &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot;, voiced by Grey Griffin. In this show, she is depicted as having an evil twin sister named Melinda the Mean (also voiced by Grey Griffin).

===&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1942, stage adaptation)===
In 1942 the 1939 film was adapted into a stage musical for performance at The MUNY in St. Louis. This version has been performed widely throughout the United States. Glinda in this version is called the Sorceress of the North; and Broadway star and ballerina Patricia Bowman portrayed the role in its initial staging.

===&quot;The Wiz&quot;===
In the Broadway musical &quot;The Wiz&quot;, Glinda is the Good Witch of the North, as she appears in the Oz books. She appears only once at the end of the musical to help Dorothy return to Kansas from the Land of Oz. Glinda is the sister of Addaperle (Abrakadabra), Evillene (Sadista), and Evvamean, the other three witches of Oz. The role was originated by Dee Dee Bridgewater. In the film version, she is played by Lena Horne, and she causes the snowstorm that brings Dorothy to Oz. She is portrayed by Uzo Aduba in the 2015 television special.

===&quot;Wicked&quot;===

&quot;Wicked&quot; is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman. It is based on the 1995 Gregory Maguire novel &quot;Wicked&quot;, an alternative telling of the 1939 film and L. Frank Baum&#x27;s classic story. The musical is told from the perspective of the witches of the Land of Oz; its plot begins before and continues after Dorothy&#x27;s arrival in Oz from Kansas, and it includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum&#x27;s novel. &quot;Wicked&quot; tells the story of two unlikely friends, Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West) who was born in Munchkinland as well as Galinda of the Upper Uplands, Gillikin County. The two friends struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the Wizard&#x27;s corrupt government and, ultimately, Elphaba&#x27;s public fall from grace. Kristin Chenoweth originated the role. Ariana Grande plays the role in the film adaptation of the musical.

<text>The Staatsoper Unter den Linden ( State Opera under the Lime Trees), also known as the Berlin State Opera (), is a listed building on Unter den Linden boulevard in the historic center of Berlin, Germany. The opera house was built by order of Prussian king Frederick the Great from 1741 to 1743 according to plans by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff in the Palladian style. Damaged during the Allied bombing in World War II, the former Royal Prussian Opera House was rebuilt from 1951 to 1955 as part of the Forum Fridericianum square. Nicknamed &quot;Lindenoper&quot; in Berlin, it is &quot;the world´s oldest state opera&quot; and &quot;the first theater anywhere to be, by itself, a prominent, freestanding monumental building in a city.&quot;

==History==
===Names===
Originally called the (&#x27;Royal Opera&#x27;), the company was renamed the (&#x27;Prussian State Opera&#x27;) in 1919. After World War II it began operating as the national opera company for Communist East Germany, taking the name (&#x27;German State Opera&#x27;) in 1955. 

In the West and colloquially, however, people used the name (&#x27;State Opera &#x27;) after the boulevard on which the theatre sits. This usage became more common after the collapse of East Germany in 1990, but, contrary to the company&#x27;s website, it was not officially adopted until 1995 and the old name still appeared on new recordings issued by the company as late as the following year.

===Early years===

King Frederick II of Prussia, shortly after his accession to the throne, commissioned the original building on the site. Though architecturally significant as an early example of the Palladian revival in Germany, the north and west façades are direct copies of Colen Campbell&#x27;s elevations at Stourhead and Wanstead respectively. Construction work began in July 1741, with what was designed by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff to be the first part of a &quot;Forum Fredericianum&quot; on present-day Bebelplatz. Although not entirely completed, the Court Opera (&quot;Hofoper&quot;) was inaugurated with a performance of Carl Heinrich Graun&#x27;s &quot;Cesare e Cleopatra&quot; on 7 December 1742. This event marked the beginning of the successful, 250-year co-operation between the Staatsoper and the Staatskapelle Berlin, the state orchestra, whose roots trace back to the 16th century.

In 1821, the Berlin Opera—hosted at the Schauspielhaus Berlin—gave the premiere of Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;. In 1842, Wilhelm Taubert instituted the tradition of regular symphonic concerts. In the same year, Giacomo Meyerbeer succeeded Gaspare Spontini as General Music Director. Felix Mendelssohn also conducted symphonic concerts for a year.

On 18 August 1843 the Linden Opera was destroyed by fire. The reconstruction of the building was supervised by architect Carl Ferdinand Langhans, and the Königliches Opernhaus (Royal Opera House) was inaugurated the following autumn by a performance of Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Ein Feldlager in Schlesien&quot;. In 1849, Otto Nicolai&#x27;s &quot;Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor&quot; was premiered at the Royal Opera House, conducted by the composer.

===20th century===

At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the Royal Court Opera, Berlin, attracted many illustrious conductors. They included Felix von Weingartner, Karl Muck, Richard Strauss, Leo Blech and George Szell. After the collapse of the German Empire in 1918, the Opera was renamed &quot;Staatsoper Unter den Linden&quot; and the &quot;Königliche Kapelle&quot; became &quot;Kapelle der Staatsoper&quot;.

In the 1920s, Kurt Adler, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Erich Kleiber, Otto Klemperer, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Bruno Walter occupied the conductor&#x27;s post. In 1925, Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, was given its premiere in a production conducted by Erich Kleiber in the composer&#x27;s presence.

After having undergone an extensive renovation, the Linden Opera reopened on 28 April 1928 with a new production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;. The cast included Delia Reinhardt, Richard Tauber, Friedrich Schorr and Leo Schützendorf, conducted by Erich Kleiber. The same year, the famous Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin and Serge Diaghilev&#x27;s &quot;Ballets Russes&quot; with conductor Ernest Ansermet were guest performers. In 1930 Erich Kleiber conducted the premiere of Darius Milhaud&#x27;s &quot;Christophe Colomb&quot;. However, in 1934, when symphonic pieces from Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot; were performed by Kleiber, the National Socialists provoked a scandal and the conductor was forced into exile.

After the &quot;Machtergreifung&quot; by the Nazis, members of Jewish origin were dismissed from the ensemble. Many German musicians associated with the opera went into exile, including the conductors Kurt Adler, Otto Klemperer and Fritz Busch. Clemens Krauss became a prominent German conductor first at the Berlin State Opera in 1933 and was then appointed as its director in 1935 due to Fritz Busch and Erich Kleiber resigning, respectively, their positions in protest over Nazi rule. In Nazi Germany, Robert Heger, Herbert von Karajan (1939–1945) and Johannes Schüler were the &quot;Staatskapellmeister&quot;.

The opera house was destroyed on the night of 9/10 April 1941, during an air raid by the RAF. Hitler ordered its immediate reconstruction, despite wartime shortages, to increase morale. It reopened on 12 December 1942 with a performance of &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, conducted by Wilhelm Furtwängler, in celebration of the building&#x27;s 200th anniversary.

The opera house was ruined again in an air raid on 3 February 1945, when it was hit by three bombs that destroyed most of the structure, except the main facade on Unter den Linden.

===Postwar years===
The second rebuilding took a long time. From 1945, the opera company performed at the Admiralspalast. From 1949, the company served as the state opera of East Germany. It moved back to its original home after the rebuilding in freely adapted baroque forms was finally completed in 1955. The newly rebuilt opera house was opened, again, with Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. The capacity is now about 1,300. After the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, the Opera was somewhat isolated, but still maintained a comprehensive repertoire that featured the classic and romantic period together with contemporary ballet and operas.

After reunification, the Linden Opera rejoined the operatic world. Important works that had already performed in the past were rediscovered and discussed anew within the framework of a &quot;Berlin Dramaturgy&quot;. Baroque Opera in particular was at the center of attention, with Graun&#x27;s &quot;Cleopatra e Cesare&quot;, Keiser&#x27;s &quot;Croesus&quot;, Florian Leopold Gassmann&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;opera seria&quot; and Scarlatti&#x27;s &quot;Griselda&quot;. These works were performed by Belgian conductor René Jacobs together with the Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin and the Freiburger Barockorchester on period instruments. In the 1990s, the opera was officially renamed &quot;Staatsoper Unter den Linden&quot;.

In 1992, the Argentine-Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim was appointed &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot; (GMD). In 2000, the orchestra, according to its official website, elected Barenboim &quot;conductor for life.&quot; During the 2002 &quot;Festtage&quot;, he led a Wagner cycle in ten parts, a production created in collaboration with director Harry Kupfer. 

In 2009, the Berlin State Opera was closed for renovation work led by German architect HG Merz. The roof of the opera building was raised and the proscenium prolonged to improve the acoustics. Other renovation and extension efforts included the director&#x27;s building, the below-ground connection building and the depot building. The latter houses the new rehearsal center. The house was reopened in 2017 with premieres of Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot; and Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; on one weekend. The opera house also hosts the Staatskapelle Berlin orchestra.

On 6 January 2023, the company announced the resignation of Barenboim as its GMD, for health reasons. In January 2023, Christian Thielemann stepped in as an emergency substitute conductor for Barenboim in a new company production of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. In September 2023, the company announced the appointment of Thielemann as its next GMD, effective 1 September 2024.

<text>The Battle of Alesia or siege of Alesia (September 52 BC) was the climactic military engagement of the Gallic Wars, fought around the Gallic &quot;oppidum&quot; (fortified settlement) of Alesia in modern France, a major centre of the Mandubii tribe. It was fought by the Roman army of Julius Caesar against a confederation of Gallic tribes united under the leadership of Vercingetorix of the Arverni. It was the last major engagement between Gauls and Romans, and is considered one of Caesar&#x27;s greatest military achievements and a classic example of siege warfare and investment; the Roman army built dual lines of fortifications—an inner wall to keep the besieged Gauls in, and an outer wall to keep the Gallic relief force out. The Battle of Alesia marked the end of Gallic independence in the modern day territory of France and Belgium.

The battle site was probably atop Mont Auxois, above modern Alise-Sainte-Reine in France, but this location, some have argued, does not fit Caesar&#x27;s description of the battle. A number of alternatives have been proposed over time, among which only Chaux-des-Crotenay (in Jura in modern France) remains a challenger today.

The event is described by Caesar himself in his &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot; as well as several later ancient authors (namely Plutarch and Cassius Dio). After the Roman victory, Gaul (very roughly modern France) was subdued, although Gallic territories north of Gallia Narbonensis would not become a Roman province until 27 BC. The Roman Senate granted Caesar a thanksgiving of 20 days for his victory in the Gallic War.

==Background==
In 58 BC, following his first consulship in 59 BC, Julius Caesar engineered his own appointment as proconsul (governor) of three Roman provinces by the First Triumvirate. These were Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy), Illyricum (on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea) and Gallia Narbonensis (in southeastern France and the rest of France&#x27;s Mediterranean coast). Although the proconsular term of office was meant to be one year, Caesar&#x27;s governorship was for an unprecedented five years. He also had the command of four legions.

Caesar engaged in the Gallic Wars (58–50 BC), which led to his conquest of Gaul beyond Gallia Narbonensis. When the Helvetii, a federation of tribes from what is now Switzerland, planned a migration to the Atlantic coast through Gaul, Caesar went to Geneva and forbade the Helvetii to move into Gaul. While he went to Gallia Cisalpina to collect three other legions, the Helvetii attacked the territories of the Aedui, Ambarri, and Allobroges, three Gallic tribes, which called for Caesar&#x27;s help. Caesar and his Gallic allies defeated the Helvetii. The Gallic tribes then asked for Caesar to intervene against an invasion by the Suebi, a Germanic tribe. Caesar defeated the Suebi and, to demonstrate Roman power, crossed the Rhine in 56 BC. In 57 BC he intervened in intra-Gallic conflicts and marched on the Belgae of northern Gaul. From then on he conquered the Gallic peoples one by one. His successes in Gaul brought Caesar political prestige in Rome and great wealth through the spoils of wars and the sale of war captives as slaves.

Gallic existential concerns came to a head in 52 BC and caused the widespread revolt the Romans had long feared. The campaigns of 53 BC had been particularly harsh, and the Gauls feared for their prosperity. Previously, they had not been united, which had made them easy to conquer. But this changed in 53 BC, when Caesar announced that Gaul was now being treated as a Roman province, subject to Roman laws and religion. This was a subject of immense concern for the Gauls, who feared the Romans would destroy the Gallic holy land, which the Carnutes watched over. Each year the druids met there to mediate between the tribes on the lands considered the center of Gaul. A threat to their sacred lands was an issue that finally united the Gauls. Over the winter the charismatic king of the Arverni tribe, Vercingetorix, assembled an unprecedented grand coalition of Gauls.

==Prelude==

Caesar was still in Rome when news of the revolt reached him. He rushed north in attempt to prevent the revolt from spreading, heading first to Provence to see to its defense, and then to Agedincum to counter the Gallic forces. Caesar took a winding route to the Gallic army to capture several &quot;oppidum&quot; for supplies. Vercingetorix was forced to withdraw from his siege of the Boii (allied to Rome) capital of Gorgobina. However, it was still winter, and Vercingetorix realised the reason Caesar had detoured was that the Romans were low on supplies. Thus, Vercingetorix set out a strategy to starve the Romans. He avoided attacking the Romans outright, and instead raided foraging parties and supply trains. Vercingetorix abandoned a great many &quot;oppidum&quot;, seeking to only defend the strongest, and to ensure the others and their supplies could not fall into Roman hands. Once again, Caesar&#x27;s hand was forced by a lack of supplies, and he besieged the &quot;oppidum&quot; of Avaricum where Vercingetorix had pulled back to.

Vercingetorix had originally been opposed to defending Avaricum, but the Bituriges Cubi had persuaded him otherwise. The Gallic army was camped outside the settlement. Even while defending, Vercingetorix wished to abandon the siege and outrun the Romans. But the warriors of Avaricum were unwilling to leave it. Upon Caesar&#x27;s arrival, he promptly began construction of a defensive fortification. The Gauls continuously harassed the Romans and their foraging parties while they built their camp, and attempted to burn it down. But not even the fierce winter weather could stop the Romans, and a very sturdy camp was built in just 25 days. Siege engines were built, and Caesar waited for an opportunity to attack the heavily fortified &quot;oppidum&quot;. He chose to attack during a rainstorm, where the sentries were distracted. Siege towers were used to assault the fort, and artillery battered the walls. Eventually, the artillery broke a hole in the wall, and the Gauls were unable to stop the Romans from taking the settlement. The Romans then looted and raped the settlement; Caesar took no prisoners and claimed the Romans slew 40,000. That the Gallic coalition did not fall apart after this defeat is a testament to the leadership of Vercingetorix. Despite this setback, the Aedui were willing to revolt and join the coalition. This was yet another setback to Caesar&#x27;s supply lines, as he could no longer get supplies through the Aedui (though the taking of Avaricum had supplied the army for the moment).
Vercingetorix now withdrew to Gergovia, the capital of his own tribe, which he was eager to defend. Caesar arrived as the weather warmed and fodder finally became available which somewhat eased supply issues. As usual, Caesar promptly set to building a fortification for the Romans. Caesar then set about capturing territory closer to the &quot;oppidum&quot;. What happened in the ensuing Battle of Gergovia remains somewhat unclear. Caesar claimed that he had just ordered his men to take a hill near to the &quot;oppidum&quot;, and that he then sounded a retreat. But no such retreat occurred and the Romans directly assaulted the settlement. Gilliver finds it likely that Caesar did not actually sound a retreat and that it was his plan all along to directly assault the settlement. Caesar&#x27;s dubious claim is likely to distance himself from the ensuing and overwhelming failure of the Romans. The Roman assault ended in clear defeat as the Romans were greatly outnumbered. Caesar (whose self-reported casualty numbers are likely much lower than the actual amount) claims that 700 men died including 46 centurions. Caesar withdrew from his siege and Vercingetorix&#x27;s victory attracted many new tribes to his cause. So too, however, did the Romans who convinced numerous Germanic tribes to join them.

Vercingetorix marched the army he had gathered thus far, mainly cavalry, to intercept Caesar. The two armies met in the Battle of the Vingeanne, where Caesar won the subsequent victory defeating Vercingetorix&#x27;s cavalry.

==Siege==
With his cavalry routed Vercingetorix withdrew towards the Mandubii &quot;oppidum&quot; of Alesia, in what would become the siege of Alesia. After the poor performance at Gergovia, a direct assault on the Gauls by Caesar was no longer a viable solution. Thus, Caesar opted simply to besiege the settlement and starve out the defenders. Vercingetorix was fine with this, as he intended to use Alesia as a trap to conduct a pincer attack on the Romans, and sent a call for a relieving army at once. Vercingetorix likely did not expect the intensity of the Roman siege preparations. Although modern archeology suggests that Caesar&#x27;s preparations were not as complete as he describes, it is apparent that Caesar laid some truly incredible siege works. Over the span of a month, some 25 miles of fortifications were built. They included a trench for soldiers, an anti-cavalry moat, towers at regular intervals, and booby traps in front of the trenches. The fortifications were dug in two lines, one to protect from the defenders, and one to protect from the relievers. Archeological evidence suggests the lines were not continuous as Caesar claims, and made much use of the local terrain, but it is apparent that they worked. Vercingetorix&#x27;s relieving army arrived quickly, yet concerted coordinated attacks by both the defenders and relievers failed to oust the Romans.

Alesia was an &quot;oppidum&quot; (fortified settlement) on a lofty hill, with two rivers on two different sides. Due to such strong defensive features, Caesar decided on a siege to force surrender by starvation. Considering that about 80,000 men were garrisoned in Alesia, together with the local civilian population, this would not have taken long. To guarantee a perfect blockade, Caesar ordered the construction of an encircling set of fortifications, a contravallation, around Alesia. It was eleven Roman miles long (16 km or 10 modern miles, each Roman mile equal to 1,000 paces), and had 23 redoubts (towers). While work was in progress, the Gauls carried out cavalry sallies to disrupt the construction. Caesar placed the legions in front of the camp in case of a sortie by the enemy infantry and got his Germanic allies to pursue the Gallic cavalry.

Before the encompassing fortifications were complete and under cover of night, Vercingetorix sent out all his cavalry to rally the tribes to war and come to aid him at Alesia. When Caesar heard of this from deserters and captives, he dug a trench twenty &quot;pedes&quot; (6 metres, 19 modern feet) with perpendicular sides and built all the other works four hundred stades (probably 592 m, 1943 feet) away from that trench. The object of placing this trench so far away from the rest of the works was, as Caesar explained, that the manning of the entrenchment was not easy and, thus, this distance was a protection against surprise enemy advances at night or against javelins or other missiles being thrown at the Roman troops who were building the works during the day. Between this advance trench and the entrenchment, he dug two more trenches 15 &quot;pedes&quot; (4.45 m, 14.6 ft) wide and deep. He filled the inner one, where the ground was level with the plain or sank below it, with water from the river. Behind the three trenches he built a rampart riveted with palisades 12 &quot;pedes&quot; high (3.57 m, 11.7 ft). On top of this he built battlements (parapets with squared openings for shooting through) and breastwork (wooden screens at breast height to protect the defenders) with large horizontal pointed stakes projecting from the joints of the screens to prevent the enemy from scaling it. All round the works he set turrets at intervals of 80 &quot;pedes&quot; (24 m, 78 ft).

Some of the Roman soldiers had to go a considerable distance to get the timber for the construction of the works and grain to feed the troops. This reduced the number of troops at the Roman works. The Gauls made sorties with large forces to attack the works. Therefore, Caesar added further structures to the works to make them defensible by the reduced number of troops. Cut tree trunks were sharpened to create stakes. They were fastened at the bottom and sunk into a five &quot;pedes&quot; deep trench (1.5 m, 4.9 ft) with the boughs protruding from the ground. They were tied in rows of five so that they could not be pulled up without the attackers being impaled by the sharp stakes. Pits three &quot;pedes&quot; (0.9 m, 2.9 ft) deep which sloped inwards slightly to the bottom were dug in front of the stakes. They were placed in five intersected rows in the shape of a quincunx (an arrangement of five objects with four at the corners and the fifth at the centre). Tapering stakes, the thickness of a man&#x27;s thigh, were sharpened at the top, hardened with fire, and sunk in the pits. They protruded from the bottom of the pit to a height of four fingers. Earth was pressed hard to a height of one foot from the bottom of the pit to make the stakes firm. The rest of the pit was covered with twigs and broken-off tree branches to hide the trap. Eight rows of this kind were placed three &quot;pedes&quot; (0.9 m, 2.9 ft). In front of these, one &quot;pes&quot; (0.3 m, 0.97 ft) stakes with iron hooks were sunk into the ground and scattered close to each other all over the field.

To prepare for the arrival of the Gallic relief forces, Caesar constructed an outer fortification (a circumvallation) with the same specifications but facing the opposite way as protection against the external attack by this relief force. It followed the most favourable ground and formed a circuit of 14 Roman miles (20.7 km, 12.86 modern miles).

The food supply of the population of Alesia and the 80,000 soldiers it hosted could not last long. Vercingetorix ordered all the grain to be brought to him and rationed it. The Gauls held a council, and it was decided that the old and the sick should leave the town. The inhabitants of the town also sent out their wives and children to save food for the fighters, hoping that Caesar would take them as captives and feed them. However, Caesar forbade their being admitted to his fortification, and Vercingetorix left his people out between the fortifications to starve to death.

===Battle===
Meanwhile, the Gallic relief force arrived and encamped on a hill one mile from the Roman fortification. The next day the Gauls encamped near the town. They then attacked the outer Roman fortification. The besieged Gauls simultaneously attacked the inner Roman fortification. However, this combined attack was unsuccessful. The next day the Gauls attacked at night. Marc Antony and Caius Trebonius brought in troops from the remotest forts in support of their comrades. At the first light of day, the Gallic relief forces, fearing being surrounded by a Roman sally, withdrew. The advance of the besieged Gauls, led by Vercingetorix, was delayed by having to fill trenches dug by the Romans. On hearing of the retreat of their comrades the besieged Gauls returned to the town.

The Gauls spotted a weakness in the Roman fortification. The north side of a hill could not be included in the Roman works and they placed a camp with two legions on steep and disadvantageous ground (this is indicated by a circle in the figure). Thus, the Gauls selected 60,000 men and appointed Vercassivellaunus, a near relative of Vercingetorix, to lead the attack on that spot. They marched there before dawn and launched the attack at noon. Vercingetorix made a sally and attacked any part of the inner fortification which seemed weak. Caesar sent Labienus to support the defense of the weak area with six cohorts of cavalry. He sent Brutus with six cohorts of cavalry and then Caius Fabius with a further seven cohorts of cavalry to defend the inner fortification. Finally, leading fresh troops, he joined in. The attack was repelled. Caesar then marched to the assistance of Labienus, drafting four cohorts and ordering part of the cavalry to follow him and part of it to leave the outer fortification and attack the Gallic relief force from the rear. Labienus was on the verge of collapse and informed Caesar of his decision of making a sally as he had been instructed. Caesar hastened. His arrival galvanised the Roman troops, who &quot;lay aside their javelins [and] carr[ied] on the engagement with their swords.&quot; The Roman cavalry was suddenly seen at the rear of the Gauls, the Roman troops advanced rapidly and the Gauls fled. They were intercepted by the cavalry and slaughtered. The besieged Gauls were pulled back from the fortification. They fled their camps and Caesar commented that &quot;had not the soldiers been wearied by sending frequent reinforcements, and the labour of the entire day, all the enemy&#x27;s forces could have been destroyed&quot;. At midnight the Roman cavalry was sent to pursue them. Many were killed and many fled to the lands they came from.

After multiple attacks, the Gauls realized that they could not overcome the truly impressive Roman siege works. At this point, it became clear that the Romans would be able to outlast the defenders, and that the revolt was doomed. The relieving army melted away.

The next day Vercingetorix convened the Gallic council and proposed that he should be killed or surrendered alive to appease the Romans. Caesar ordered the Gauls to surrender their weapons and deliver their chieftains. The chieftains were brought before him and Vercingetorix was surrendered. Captives were given to the Roman soldiers as part of the spoils of war apart from the Aedui and Arverni, whom he hoped to win over.

== Aftermath ==
With the revolt crushed, Caesar set his legions to winter across the lands of the defeated tribes to prevent further rebellion. Troops were also sent to the Remi, who had been steadfast allies to the Romans throughout the campaign. But resistance was not entirely over: southwest Gaul had not yet been pacified.
Alesia proved to be the end of generalized and organized resistance against Caesar&#x27;s invasion of Gaul and effectively marked the end of the Gallic Wars. In the next year (50 BC) there were mopping-up operations. During the Roman civil wars Gallia was essentially left on its own. Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa became its first governor in 39–38 BC. In 39 BC he settled the Ubians on the west bank of the River Rhine and in 38 BC he suppressed a rebellion in Aquitania. He built a radial network of roads centred on the Gallic capital, Lugdunum (Lyon). Gallia was divided into three Roman provinces; Gallia Aquitania, Gallia Lugdununensis and Gallia Belgica. Only the Arverni kept their independence thanks to their victory against Caesar at the Battle of Gergovia.

For Caesar, Alesia was an enormous personal success, both militarily and politically. The Senate declared 20 days of thanksgiving for this victory but, due to political reasons, refused Caesar the honour of celebrating a triumphal parade, the peak of any general&#x27;s career. Political tension increased, and two years later, in 49 BC, Caesar crossed the Rubicon, precipitating the Roman Civil War of 49–45 BC, which he won. After having been elected consul for each of the years of the civil war, and appointed to several temporary dictatorships, he was finally made &quot;dictator perpetuus&quot; (dictator for life), by the Roman Senate in 44 BC. His ever-increasing personal power and honours undermined the tradition-bound republican foundations of Rome. More civil wars followed his assassination. The last one was a conflict between Octavian (later known as Augustus) and Marc Antony over who would be the sole ruler of Rome, which Octavius won. This led to the &quot;de facto&quot; end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of rule by emperors.

Vercingetorix was taken prisoner and held as a captive in Rome for the next five years awaiting Caesar&#x27;s triumph (which was delayed by the Civil War). As was traditional for such captured enemy leaders, he was paraded in the triumph, then taken to the Tullianum and ritually garrotted in 46 BC.

The Gallic Wars lack a clear end date. The legions continued to be active in Gaul through 50 BC, when Aulus Hirtius took over the writing of Caesar&#x27;s reports on the war. The campaigns may well have continued, if not for the impending Roman civil war. The legions in Gaul were eventually pulled out in 50 BC as the civil war drew near, for Caesar would need them to defeat his enemies in Rome. The Gauls had not been entirely subjugated, and were not yet a formal part of the empire. But that task was not Caesar&#x27;s, and he left that to his successors. Gaul would not formally be made into Roman provinces until the reign of Augustus in 27 BC, and there may have been unrest in the region as late as AD 70.

==Importance==
Paul K. Davis writes that &quot;Caesar&#x27;s victory over the combined Gallic forces established Roman dominance in Gaul for the next 500 years. Caesar&#x27;s victory also created a rivalry with the Roman government, leading to his invasion of the Italian peninsula.&quot;

== Identification of the site ==
For many years, the actual location of the battle was unknown. Competing theories focused first on two towns, Alaise in the Franche-Comté and Alise-Sainte-Reine in the Côte-d&#x27;Or. Emperor Napoleon III of France supported the latter candidate, and, during the 1860s, funded archaeological research that uncovered the evidence to support the existence of Roman camps in the area. He then dedicated a statue to Vercingetorix in the recently discovered ruins.

Uncertainty has nevertheless persisted, with questions being raised about the validity of Alise-Sainte-Reine&#x27;s claim. For example, the site is said to be too small to accommodate even revised estimates of 80,000 men with the Gallic infantry, along with cavalry and additional personnel. It is also alleged that the topography of the area does not fit with Caesar&#x27;s description. In the 1960s, a French archaeologist, André Berthier, argued that the hill top was too low to have required a siege, and that the &quot;rivers&quot; were actually small streams.

Berthier proposed that the location of the battle was at Chaux-des-Crotenay at the gate of the Jura mountains – a place that better suits the descriptions in Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Gallic Wars&quot;. Roman fortifications have been found at this site. Danielle Porte, a Sorbonne professor, continues to challenge the identification of Alise-Sainte-Reine as the battle site, but the director of the Alesia museum, Laurent de Froberville, maintains that scientific evidence supports this identification. Classical historian and archaeologist Colin Wells took the view that the excavations at Alise-Sainte-Reine in the 1990s should have removed all possible doubt about the site and regarded some of the advocacy of alternative locations as &quot;...passionate nonsense&quot;.

==Numbers involved==
Precise figures for the size of the armies involved, and the number of casualties suffered, are difficult to know. Such figures have always been a powerful propaganda weapon, and are thus suspect. Caesar, in his &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;, refers to a Gallic relief force of a quarter of a million, probably an exaggeration to enhance his victory. The only records of the events are Roman and, therefore, presumed to be biased. Modern historians usually believe that a number between fifty thousand and one hundred thousand men is more credible.

<text>Judith, Countess of Listowel (12 July 1903 – 15 July 2003) was a Hungarian-born journalist and anti-Communist writer who was married to William Hare, 5th Earl of Listowel from 1933 to 1945.

==Biography ==
She was born Judit Márffy-Mantuano de Versegh et Leno on the family estate in Kaposvár, Hungary, on 12 July 1903. She was the daughter of Rodolfo Mantuano (1869–1940), an economic adviser in the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who acquired the title and estates of the Hungarian Márffy family in 1902 and was later known as Rezső (Raoul) de Márffy-Mantuano; and the sister of Tamás Márffy. In 1926, she won a scholarship to study economic history at the London School of Economics (graduating in 1929), where she met &quot;Billy&quot; Hare, a lieutenant in the Intelligence Corps, from 1931 the 5th Earl of Listowel and a Labour Party peer, whom she married in Budapest in 1933. The couple were ill-fitted due to differences in worldview: she was a conservative Catholic, while his convictions were socialist and atheist. They separated in 1938 and the Countess never re-married. She is said to have benefitted from her husband&#x27;s political network.

In the 1920s, she wrote a volume of short stories about Hungarian society. After her graduation in 1929, she worked as a journalist in England for the Hungarian newspapers &quot;Nemzeti Újság&quot; and &quot;Pester Lloyd&quot; until 1940. In 1932, she interviewed Hitler&#x27;s early American patron and a Nazi Party chief, Ernst Hanfstaengl, on economic matters, before he fell from favour in 1933. In 1934, she returned to Germany with her husband and attempted to investigate the Nazi concentration camps, which resulted in their names being put on the &quot;Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.&quot;.

After World War II was declared, Lady Listowel urged both Galeazzo Ciano, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s son-in-law, and her own brother&#x27;s in-law, the Hungarian prime minister Pál Teleki, not to side with Adolf Hitler. From 1939 to 1941, she was a lecturer for the British Ministry of Information and Ministry of Defence, and from 1942 to 1944 a civilian lecturer in the British Armed Forces. On 19 December 1940, she addressed the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House with a talk entitled &quot;Why Hungary Had to Do It&quot;.

She and her husband, then Under-Secretary of State for India, divorced in 1945, the year he was appointed Postmaster General of the United Kingdom in the Labour government of Clement Attlee. They had one daughter, Deirdre, later Baroness Grantley (born 1935).

From October 1944 to September 1954, she published the weekly news bulletin &quot;East Europe&quot; as a joint effort with the two wartime commanders of the Second Department of Polish General Staff (military intelligence and counterintelligence) in exile, Jan Kowalewski and Jerzy Niezbrzycki. It appeared as &quot;East Europe. Bulletin of Seven East European Countries&quot; (&quot;S.E.E.C. Bulletin&quot;) between 1944–50, as &quot;East Europe and Soviet Russia&quot; between 1950–53, and as &quot;Soviet Orbit&quot; during 1954. In total, 493 issues of the title were produced over the ten years of existence. Due to the bulletin&#x27;s anti-Soviet and anti-Communist propaganda, she was banned from entering Hungary until 1964. She travelled to Austria and crossed the border illegally on 4 November 1956 to cover the events of the Hungarian uprising, but returned after a few days and eventually produced her report by interviewing refugees.

By the late 1940s, she was part of C. A. Smith&#x27;s anti-Communist network of aristocrats and industrialists which, along with the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists and former members of the Freedom and Democracy Trust, helped launch the British chapter of Natalie Paine&#x27;s American anti-Communist action group Common Cause in November 1951. She also worked with the Foreign Office&#x27;s secret anti-Communist propaganda arm, the Information Research Department, where her contact person in December 1951 was Mollie Hamilton.

By the 1960s, she took an active interest in the decolonisation process within the British-ruled territories in Africa, which is said to have stemmed from her ex-husband&#x27;s involvement in colonial governance. The publication of her first book on the subject, &quot;The Making of Tanganyika&quot; (1965), written on request as a semi-official history of the country, coincided with the shift to one-party state in Tanzania under President Julius Nyerere in 1965, and with the white government of Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence also in 1965. Listowel followed the activities of Oscar Kambona as the emergent leader of the opposition to Nyerere and the TANU Party in Tanzania dating to 1968–71. She travelled to Rhodesia and held conversations with oppositionists Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the founder of the African National Council (1971), and Pat Bashford, the founder of the Centre Party between 1974–75. Her papers preserved at the Borthwick Institute for Archives include material on the Pearce Commission of 1971, the Rhodesian Constitution, and the Catholic Church in Rhodesia. In 1973, she produced an Irish University Press-commissioned book on the rise of Idi Amin to power in Uganda and lost the resulting lawsuit for defamation to Milton Obote.

She was a regular contributor to &quot;The Listener&quot;, &quot;The Tablet&quot;, and &quot;The Statist&quot;.

During the 1980s, her interests shifted to the disintegration of the Eastern Bloc and she made several visits to Poland. She returned to Hungary after 1990 and received compensation from the state.

She died 3 days after her 100th birthday in July 2003, possibly in England.

<text>A curator (from , meaning &#x27;to take care&#x27;) is a manager or overseer. When working with cultural organizations, a curator is typically a &quot;collections curator&quot; or an &quot;exhibitions curator&quot;, and has multifaceted tasks dependent on the particular institution and its mission. The term &quot;curator&quot; may designate the head of any given division, not limited to museums. Curator roles include &quot;community curators&quot;, &quot;literary curators&quot;, &quot;digital curators&quot;, and &quot;biocurators&quot;.

== Collections curator ==

A &quot;collections curator&quot;, a &quot;museum curator&quot;, or a &quot;keeper&quot; of a cultural heritage institution (e.g., gallery, museum, library, or archive) is a content specialist charged with an institution&#x27;s collections and involved with the interpretation of heritage material including historical artifacts. A collections curator&#x27;s concern necessarily involves tangible objects of some sort—artwork, collectibles, historic items, or scientific collections.

In smaller organizations, a curator may have sole responsibility for acquisitions and even for collections care. A curator makes decisions regarding what objects to select, oversees their potential and documentation, conducts research based on the collection and its history, provides proper packaging of object for transportation, and shares research with the public and community through exhibitions and publications. In very small, volunteer-based museums, such as those of local historical societies, a curator may be the only paid staff-member.

In larger institutions, the curator&#x27;s primary function is that of a subject specialist, with the expectation that he or she will conduct original research on objects and guide the organization in its collecting. Such institutions can have multiple curators, each assigned to a specific collecting area (e.g., curator of ancient art, curator of prints and drawings, etc.) and often operating under the direction of a head curator. In such organizations, the physical care of the collection may be overseen by museum collections-managers or by museum conservators, with documentation and administrative matters (such as personnel, insurance, and loans) handled by a museum registrar.

In France, the term &quot;collections curator&quot; is translated as &quot;conservateur&quot;. There are two kinds of &quot;conservateurs&quot;: heritage curators (&quot;conservateurs du patrimoine&quot;) with five specialities (archeology, archives, museums, historical monuments, natural science museums), and librarian curators (&quot;conservateurs des bibliothèques&quot;). These curators are selected by competitive examination and attend the INP (Institut National du Patrimoine). The &quot;conservateurs du patrimoine&quot; are civil servants or work in the public service; the use of the title by private workers is not possible.

In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;curator&quot; also applies to government employees who monitor the quality of contract archaeological work under Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and Planning (PPG 16) and manage the cultural resource of a region. In a museum setting, a curator in the United Kingdom may also be called a &quot;keeper&quot;.

== Exhibitions curator ==
An &quot;exhibitions curator&quot; is a person in charge of conceiving and organising exhibitions.

The title &quot;curator&quot; identifies someone who selects and often interprets works for an exhibit. In addition to selecting works, the curator is often responsible for writing labels, catalog essays, and other content supporting exhibitions. Such curators may be permanent staff members, &quot;guest curators&quot; from an affiliated organization or university, or &quot;freelance curators&quot; working on a consultancy basis.

In France, the term &quot;exhibitions curator&quot; is translated as &quot;commissaire d&#x27;exposition&quot; or &quot;curateur&quot;.

The late-20th century saw an explosion of artists organizing exhibitions. The artist-curator has a long tradition of influence, notably featuring Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792), inaugural president of the Royal Academy of Arts, London, founded in 1768.

== Education and training for collections and exhibitions curators ==
Curators hold a high academic degree in their subject, typically a Doctor of Philosophy or a master&#x27;s degree in subjects such as history, art, history of art, archaeology, anthropology, or classics. Curators are also expected to have contributed to their academic field, for example, by delivering public talks, publishing articles, or presenting at specialist academic conferences. It is important that curators have knowledge of the current collecting market for their area of expertise, and are aware of current ethical practices and laws that may impact their organisation&#x27;s collecting.
The increased complexity of many museums and cultural organisations has prompted the emergence of professional programs in fields such as public history, public humanities, museum studies, arts management, and curating/curatorial practice. 
(See &quot;→External links&quot; for further information on courses.)

== Biocuration ==
A biocurator is a professional scientist who curates, collects, annotates, and validates information that is disseminated by biological databases and model organism databases.

== Engagement and community curation ==
Education and outreach play an important role in some institutions. It has led to the emergence of titles such as &quot;Curator of Education&quot; and &quot;Curator of Public Practice&quot;.

Community curation— also known as &quot;co-curation&quot;, &quot;public curation&quot; or &quot;inclusive curation&quot;—is a movement in museums, public humanities organizations, and within the biocuration field to involve community members in various curatorial processes, including exhibit development and programming.

Community members involved in community curation are likely not trained as museum professionals, but have vested interests in the outcomes of curatorial projects. Community curation is a response to the 19th century &quot;information transmission&quot; model of learning, in which museums are sources of expert knowledge and visitors are the recipients of that expertise. Community curation seeks not to abandon expertise, but to broaden definitions of expertise to &quot;include broader domains of experience&quot; that visitors bring to museums.

Community curation practices are varied. Organizations have conducted community outreach at the beginning of exhibition projects, and convenes community advisory committees at various stages in the curatorial process. or have accepted exhibit proposals from community members and trained them in curatorial skills to co-create exhibits. Such efforts to allow communities to participate in curation can require &quot;more not less expertise from museum staff&quot;.

== Literary curation ==
The term &quot;literary curator&quot; has been used to describe persons who work in the field of poetry, such as former 92nd Street Y director Karl Kirchwey.

== Technology and society ==
More recently, advances in new technologies have led to a further widening of the role of curator. This has been a focus in major art institutions internationally and has become an object of academic study and research.

In the same way that a museum curator may acquire objects of relevance or an art curator may select or interpret a work of art, the injection of technology and impact of social media into every aspect of society has seen the emergence of technology curators.

Technology curators are people who are able to disentangle the science and logic of a particular technology and apply it to real-world situations and society, whether it is for social change, commercial advantage, or other purposes. The first U.K. &quot;Wired&quot; Conference had a test lab, where an independent curator selected technology that showcased radical technology advancements and their impact on society, such as the ability to design and &quot;print&quot; physical objects using 3D printers (such as a fully working violin) or the ability to model and represent accurate interactive medical and molecular models in stereoscopic 3D.

As US museums have become increasingly more digitized, curators find themselves constructing narratives in both the material and digital worlds. Historian Elaine Gurian has called for museums in which &quot;visitors could comfortably search for answers to their own questions regardless of the importance placed on such questions by others&quot;. This would change the role of curator from teacher to &quot;facilitator and assistor&quot;. In this sense, the role of curator in the United States is precarious, as digital and interactive exhibits often allow members of the public to become their own curators, and to choose their own information. Citizens are then able to educate themselves on the specific subject they are interested in, rather than spending time listening to information they have no desire to learn.

== Other definitions ==
In Scotland, the term &quot;curator&quot; is also used to mean the guardian of a child, known as curator &quot;ad litem&quot;.

In Australia and New Zealand, the term also applies to a person who prepares a sports ground for use (especially a cricket ground). This job is equivalent to that of groundsman in some other cricketing nations.

Obsolete terms referring to a female curator are &quot;curatrix&quot; and &quot;curatress&quot;.

<text>Arena Hall (originally known as the Marista Hall) is an events centre in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, located on the campus of the Colégio Marista Dom Silvério. The goal was to create an environment with a great diversity of spaces. It includes a multipurpose room, a theater, an arena, courts, and a parking lot; this structure is suitable for a wide variety of cultural, artistic, and sports events, be it of a technical, commercial or recreational nature.

==About the centre==

Construction began in March 1997, and the original deadline was December 1998. However, this deadline was progressively postponed, and the building did not open until June 25, 2003.

Since a good part of the construction was financed by students of the Colégio Marista Dom Silvério, Marista Hall is a target of jokes and dissatisfaction, because thousands of students paid for it but never benefited from it, having left school before construction was completed. Further dissatisfaction came when Chevrolet began to sponsor the centre in 2005; as a result the place changed its name to &quot;Chevrolet Hall&quot;. There is a community in orkut dedicated to &quot;refusing&quot; the new name, mostly former and current students of college who feel their contributions to the site should be recognized in its name. In 2016, GM chose not to renew the contract for naming rights and the venue became known as the &quot;BH Hall&quot; until March 2017, when fuel company Ipiranga secured the naming rights. Beginning 19 March 2017, the centre is known as the &quot;KM de Vantagens Hall&quot;. It is considered the biggest house of shows of BH.

<text>Frances Ellen Watkins Harper (September 24, 1825 – February 22, 1911) was an American abolitionist, suffragist, poet, temperance activist, teacher, public speaker, and writer. Beginning in 1845, she was one of the first African American women to be published in the United States.

Born free in Baltimore, Maryland, Harper had a long and prolific career, publishing her first book of poetry at the age of 20. At 67, she published her widely praised novel &quot;Iola Leroy&quot; (1892), placing her among the first Black women to publish a novel.

As a young woman in 1850, Harper taught domestic science at Union Seminary in Columbus, Ohio, a school affiliated with the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME). In 1851, while living with the family of William Still, a clerk at the Pennsylvania Abolition Society who helped refugee slaves make their way along the Underground Railroad, Harper started to write anti-slavery literature. After joining the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1853, Harper began her career as a public speaker and political activist.

Harper also had a successful literary career. Her collection &quot;Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects&quot; (1854) was a commercial success, making her the most popular African American poet before Paul Laurence Dunbar. Her short story &quot;Two Offers&quot; was published in the &quot;Anglo-African&quot; in 1859, making literary history as the first short story published by a Black woman.

Harper founded, supported, and held high office in several national progressive organizations. In 1886, she became superintendent of the Colored Section of the Philadelphia and Pennsylvania Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. In 1896 she helped found the National Association of Colored Women and served as its vice president.

Harper died at age 85 on February 22, 1911.

== Early life and work ==

Frances Ellen Watkins was born free on September 24, 1825 in Baltimore, Maryland (then a slave state), the only child of free parents. Her parents, whose names are unknown, both died in 1828, making Watkins an orphan at the age of three. She was raised by her maternal aunt and uncle, Henrietta and Reverend William J. Watkins, Sr., who gave her their last name.

Frances Watkins&#x27;s uncle was the minister at the Sharp Street African Methodist Episcopal Church. Watkins was educated at the Watkins Academy for Negro Youth, which her uncle had established in 1820. As a civil rights activist and abolitionist, Reverend Watkins was a major influence on his niece&#x27;s life and work.

At 13, Watkins became employed as a seamstress and nursemaid for a white family that owned a bookshop. She stopped attending school but used her spare time to read from the books in the shop and work on her own writing.

In 1850, at age 26, Watkins moved from Baltimore to teach domestic science at Union Seminary, an AME-affiliated school for Black students near Columbus, Ohio. She worked as the school&#x27;s first female teacher. Union closed in 1863 when the AME Church diverted its funds to purchase Wilberforce University, the first Black-owned and operated college. The school in Wilberforce was run by the Reverend John Mifflin Brown, later a bishop in the AME Church. The following year Watkins took a position at a school in York, Pennsylvania.

==Writing career==

Harper&#x27;s writing career started in 1839 when she published pieces in antislavery journals. Her politics and writing informed each other. Her writing career started 20 years before she was married, so several of her works were published under her maiden name of Watkins.

Harper published her first volume of verse, &quot;Forest Leaves&quot;, or &quot;Autumn Leaves,&quot; in 1845 when she was 20 years old. This book marked her as an important abolitionist voice. A single copy of this volume, long lost, was rediscovered in the early 21st century by scholar Johanna Ortner in Baltimore, at the Maryland Historical Society in the 2010s. Her second book, &quot;Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects&quot; (1854), was extremely popular. Over the next few years, it was reprinted several times.

In 1858, Harper refused to give up her seat or ride in the &quot;colored&quot; section of a segregated trolley car in Philadelphia (97 years before Rosa Parks). In the same year, she published her poem &quot;Bury Me in a Free Land&quot; in &quot;The Anti-Slavery Bugle,&quot; which became one of her best known works.

In 1859, Harper&#x27;s story &quot;The Two Offers&quot; was published in &quot;The Anglo-African Newspaper&quot;, making her the first Black woman to publish a short story. That same year, &quot;Anglo-African Magazine&quot; published her essay &quot;Our Greatest Want,&quot; in which Harper linked the common religious trope of oppression of African Americans to the oppression of the Hebrew people while enslaved in Egypt. &quot;Anglo-African Magazine&quot; and the weekly &quot;Anglo-African&quot; newspaper were both Civil War-era periodicals that served as a forum for debate among abolitionists and scholars.

Harper published 80 poems. In her poem &quot;The Slave Mother&quot;, she writes: &quot;He is not hers, although she bore / For him a mother&#x27;s pains; / He is not hers, although her blood / Is coursing through his veins! / He is not hers, for cruel hands / May rudely tear apart / The only wreath of household love / That binds her breaking heart.&quot; Throughout the two stanzas, Harper demonstrates the restricted relationship between an enslaved mother and her child, while including themes of family, motherhood, humanity and slavery. Another of her poems, &quot;To the Cleveland Union Savers,&quot; published in &quot;The Anti-Slavery Bugle&quot; of Feb. 23, 1861, champions Sara Lucy Bagby, the last person in the United States to be returned to slavery under the Fugitive Slave Law.

Harper published &quot;Sketches of Southern Life&quot; in 1872. This anthology detailed her experience touring the Southern United States and meeting newly freed Black people. In these poems she described the harsh living conditions faced by a Black woman during both slavery and the Reconstruction era. Harper uses the figure of a former slave, called Aunt Chloe, as a narrator in several of these sketches.

From 1868 to 1888, Harper had three novels serialized in a Christian magazine: &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Sacrifice&quot;, &quot;Sowing and Reaping&quot;, and &quot;Trial and Triumph.&quot;

Harper is also known for what was long considered her first novel, &quot;Iola Leroy, or Shadows Uplifted&quot;, published as a book in 1892 when she was 67. This was one of the first books published by a Black woman in the United States. While using the conventions of the time, Harper dealt with serious social issues, including education for women, the social passing as white of mixed-race people, miscegenation, abolition, reconstruction, temperance, and social responsibility.

Harper was also a friend and mentor to many other African American writers and journalists, including Mary Shadd Cary, Ida B. Wells, Victoria Earle Matthews, and Kate D. Chapman.

==Gendered stereotypes of black womanhood==

When Harper began giving antislavery lectures, the first of which took place in 1854, her gender attracted attention. The challenges she faced were not limited to racial prejudices, for in those days black women who spoke publicly about racial issues were still few in number and scientific racism was deeply intertwined with scientific sexism. It was taken by some as confirmation of gendered stereotypes about the differences between black women and white women, as in the scientific thinking of the day black women were cast as a Jezebel type, &quot;governed almost entirely by her libido,&quot; drawing a stark contrast with the 19th century ideal of sexually pure white femininity.

==Progressive causes==

Frances Ellen Watkins Harper was a strong supporter of abolitionism, prohibition and woman&#x27;s suffrage, progressive causes that were connected before and after the American Civil War. She was also active in the Unitarian Church, which supported abolitionism. Harper wrote to John Brown after he had been arrested and before his execution: &quot;I thank you that you have been brave enough to reach out your hands to the crushed and blighted of my race; I hope from your sad fate great good may arise to the cause of freedom.&quot;

In 1853, Watkins joined the American Anti-Slavery Society and became a traveling lecturer for the group. She delivered many speeches during this time and faced much prejudice and discrimination along the way. In 1854, Watkins delivered her first anti-slavery speech called &quot;The Elevation and Education of Our People.&quot; The success of this speech resulted in a lecture tour in Maine for the Anti-Slavery Society. She recalled New England warmly: &quot;Dear old New England! It was there kindness encompassed my path; it was there kind voices made their music in my ear. The home of my childhood, the burial-place of my kindred, is not as dear to me as New England.&quot; She continued to travel, lecturing throughout the East, the Midwest, and Canada from 1856 to 1860. Of Pennsylvania&#x27;s treatment of African American people, Harper stated: &quot;Now let me tell you about Pennsylvania. I have been traveling nearly four years, and have been in every New England State, in New York, Canada, and Ohio; but of all these places, this is about the meanest of all.&quot;

After the Civil War ended in 1865, Harper moved South to teach newly freed Black people during the Reconstruction Era. During this time she also gave many large public speeches. In 1870, Harper worked with the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau encouraging many freedmen in Mobile, Alabama, to &quot;get land, everyone that can&quot; so they could vote and act independently once Congress passed the Fifteenth Amendment.

Harper was active in the growing number of Black organizations and came to believe that Black reformers had to be able to set their own priorities. From 1883 to 1890, she helped organize events and programs for the National Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. She had worked with members of the original WCTU, because &quot;it was the most important women&#x27;s organization to push for expanding federal power.&quot; In her role as superintendent of the Colored Section of the Philadelphia and Pennsylvania WCTU, Harper facilitated both access and independent organizing for Black women, promoting the collective action of all women as a matter of both justice and morality. &quot;Activists like Harper and Frances Willard campaigned not only for racial and sexual equality but also for a new understanding of the federal government&#x27;s responsibility to protect rights, regulate morality, and promote social welfare&quot;. Harper was disappointed, however, when Willard gave priority to white women&#x27;s concerns, rather than supporting Black women&#x27;s goals of gaining federal support for an anti-lynching law, defense of Black rights, or abolition of the convict lease system.

Harper&#x27;s public activism also continued in later years. In 1891, Harper delivered a speech to the National Council of Women of America in Washington D.C., demanding justice and equal protection by the law for the African American people. In her speech, she stated:

== Suffrage activism ==
=== Activism techniques ===
Frances Harper&#x27;s activism took an intersectional approach, which combined her campaign for African American civil rights with her advocacy for women&#x27;s rights. One of Harper&#x27;s major concerns regarded the brutal treatment Black women—including Harper herself—encountered on public transportation, and this matter foregrounded her advocacy for women&#x27;s suffrage. In the 1860s and beyond, Harper delivered various speeches pertaining to women&#x27;s issues and more specifically, Black women&#x27;s issues. One of her speeches, &quot;We Are All Bound Up Together,&quot; delivered in 1866 at the National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention in New York City, demanded equal rights for all, emphasizing the need to raise awareness for African American suffrage while also advocating for women&#x27;s suffrage. In her speech, she stated:After Harper delivered this speech, the National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention agreed to form the American Equal Rights Association (AERA), which incorporated African American suffrage into the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Movement. Harper served as a member of AERA&#x27;s Finance Committee, though Black women comprised only five of the organization&#x27;s fifty-plus officers and speakers. AERA was short-lived, ending when Congress proposed the Fifteenth Amendment, which would grant African American men the right to vote. Some of AERA&#x27;s suffragists, such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, did not support the Amendment&#x27;s aim to enfranchise Black men without extending suffrage rights to women. Harper, on the other hand, supported the Fifteenth Amendment, and endorsed the Amendment at AERA&#x27;s final meeting. Shortly afterward, AERA divided into two separate movements: the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), which did not support the Amendment, and the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which supported the Amendment. Neither organization fully promoted the rights of Black women. As a proponent of the Fifteenth Amendment, Harper helped found the AWSA. After all, Harper did not want to undermine the progress of Black men by choosing to fight for women&#x27;s suffrage over African American suffrage. Harper did, however, support the proposed Sixteenth Amendment, which would have granted women the right to vote. After the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870, Harper also encouraged formerly enslaved people to vote.

In addition to delivering speeches, Harper also promoted her intersectional suffrage advocacy in later years by helping found the National Association for Colored Women (NACW) in 1896. Harper was often the only Black woman at the progressive conferences she attended, which isolated her from the predominantly white reformers. Harper therefore helped organize the NACW to avoid the racism of white progressives. In 1897, Harper became the NACW&#x27;s vice president and used her platform to advocate for Black women&#x27;s civil rights.

=== Suffragism in literature ===
Various examples of Harper&#x27;s writing contain themes of suffrage. Her poem, &quot;The Deliverance,&quot; published in her 1872 anthology, &quot;Sketches of Southern Life&quot;, discusses the vote through the lens of fictional Black female narratives during the Reconstruction era. As scholar Elizabeth A. Petrino argues, in &quot;The Deliverance,&quot; Harper communicates how &quot;women within the home are the catalysts for political rebellion&quot; and likewise &quot;posits women as moral exemplars and centers of political power within the home.&quot; Indeed, during her years of activism, Harper expressed concern regarding how individuals would cast their ballots once granted the right to vote. Harper&#x27;s &quot;The Deliverance&quot; conveys these sentiments through several vignettes telling how different fictional men exercised their right to vote. Harper writes:In these particular stanzas, the speaker questions how the voting population will exercise their right to vote. As the character John Thomas Reeder &quot;sold his vote&quot; for food, Aunt Kitty expresses her frustration that not all people—and particularly men, in this instance—fully understand the importance of the vote. Not only does Aunt Kitty, the sole female figure in the text, &quot;toss&quot; the meat and flour, but she also scolds Reeder and makes him cry. While Aunt Kitty has agency in her encounter with Reeder, Reeder has a power of his own in possessing the right to vote. Within &quot;The Deliverance,&quot; Harper expresses a desire for Black women to obtain suffrage rights alongside their male counterparts.

In addition to &quot;The Deliverance,&quot; Harper&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Fifteenth Amendment,&quot; describes in positive terms the Fifteenth Amendment, which granted African-American men the right to vote:In these stanzas, Harper includes exclamation points, alongside imagery such as &quot;chimes&quot; of the bells, and a command for the African American people to &quot;shake off the dust.&quot; Harper additionally incorporates positive diction, such as the phrases &quot;gladness thrill&quot; and &quot;joyful triumph.&quot; Harper also uses regal language to describe the newly enfranchised population. Upon receiving voting rights, Black men are &quot;crowned&quot; and become &quot;amid the noblest of the land,&quot; posing a contrast with their &quot;once despised name&quot; that Harper references. In general, the language in &quot;The Fifteenth Amendment&quot; casts the Fifteenth Amendment in a positive light, which aligns with Harper&#x27;s previous support for the Amendment that led her to help found the American Woman Suffrage Association. Unlike &quot;The Deliverance,&quot; however, Harper&#x27;s &quot;The Fifteenth Amendment&quot; poem does not express a particular yearning for Black women&#x27;s suffrage.
Alongside her poetry, Harper&#x27;s prose also presents suffrage activism. Her novel &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Sacrifice&quot;, published in 1869—in the same year as the Fifteenth Amendment debates—describes the vote as a defense mechanism for Black women as victims of racial violence in the Reconstruction South.&quot;Minnie&#x27;s Sacrifice&quot; also highlights the intersectional struggles faced by Black women. For example, scholar Jen McDaneld argues in her analysis of the novel that the need for protection of the law, which the vote could help Black women obtain, is &quot;rooted in both radicalized and gendered injustices that cannot be extricated from one another.&quot; Near the end of the novel, Minnie expresses a desire for Black women&#x27;s suffrage, contending the right of suffrage should not be based upon &quot;service or sex, but on the common base of humanity.&quot; Responding to the male character Louis, who believes the nation is &quot;not prepared for&quot; Black women&#x27;s suffrage, Minnie states:Through Minnie&#x27;s statement, Harper conveys a desire for Black women to achieve suffrage rights in order to defend themselves from oppression. Shortly after making this claim, Minnie is killed—the result of racial violence. Minnie is not protected by the law, and she is a victim of the oppression she protests against in her pro-suffrage rhetoric. In this excerpt, Minnie also shows support for the Black man&#x27;s vote, stating how she &quot;would not throw a straw in the way of the colored man.&quot; At the same time, though, similar to the speaker in &quot;The Deliverance,&quot; Minnie additionally expresses uncertainty regarding how these men might cast their ballots. Within &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Sacrifice&quot;, Harper communicates a determination for Black women to obtain the right to suffrage.

=== Scholarship of suffrage ===
There is little scholarship detailing Frances Harper&#x27;s involvement in the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Movement. Indeed, Harper does not appear in the &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot; anthology written by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who were original members of the NWSA. As scholar Jennifer McDaneld argues, the &quot;suffrage split&quot; that created NWSA and AWSA alienated Harper—who appeared to refuse white feminism—from the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Movement.

== Personal life ==

In 1860, Frances Watkins married a widower named Fenton Harper. The couple had a daughter together, named Mary Frances Harper, and three other children from Fenton Harper&#x27;s previous marriage. When Fenton Harper died four years later, Frances Harper kept custody of Mary and moved to the East Coast. The two would continue to live there for the rest of their lives. While on the East Coast, Harper continued to give lectures to support herself.

Frances Ellen Watkins Harper died of heart failure on February 22, 1911, at the age of 85. Her funeral service was held at First Unitarian Church on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia. She was buried in Eden Cemetery in Collingdale, Pennsylvania, next to her daughter, Mary.

<text>Unterhaching (; Central Bavarian: &quot;Haching&quot;) is the second largest municipality in the district of Munich in Bavaria, Germany, located to the south of Munich city centre and easily accessible via two federal motorways, Bundesautobahn 8 and Bundesautobahn 995, and also on the Munich S-Bahn, connecting Unterhaching to Marienplatz in less than 20 minutes. The municipality is best known for its football club SpVgg Unterhaching, who played in the Bundesliga in 1999–2001 and is also home to a CO2 neutral district heating network.

==History==
Based upon the discovery of graves, the settlement of the Haching Valley can be traced back as far as 1100 B.C. The settlement of the Bavarian tribes is believed to have occurred between the fifth and eighth centuries.

The name &quot;Haching&quot; comes from the family name &quot;Hacho&quot; and the aristocracy of the Hahilinga. The name Haching is first recorded in a document from the Schäftlarn monastery in the year 806, left by the abbot Petto. Therefore, Haching is hundreds of years older than Munich.

The name &quot;Unterhaching&quot; (lat. &quot;inferiori hachingin&quot;) emerges for the first time in the year 1180 in a possession listing of the bishop of Freising (Freesing).

Up until the 1803 secularization the surrounding monasteries were the primary landowners in the area. Also derived from this is the municipal coat of arms, which today shows the abbot staff of the Schäftlarn monastery and the sea-rose sheet from the coat of arms of the monastery Tegernsee.
Unterhaching began the 20th century as purely a farming village. The number of inhabitants exploded from 616 inhabitants in 1900 to 20,545 in 2000.

In 1955 Unterhaching split from Ottobrunn and became an independent municipality.

In 1968 the building of two new large housing estates began, &quot;Grünau&quot; and &quot;Fasanenpark&quot;, which began the development of the City into a modern housing development.

==Sports==
Unterhaching is well known in Germany for its football team SpVgg Unterhaching, which played in the Bundesliga during the 1999–2000 and 2000–01 seasons. The club now oscillates between the regional state league (the fourth tier) and the third division and share local rivalries with 1860 Munich and Bayern Munich&#x27;s reserve team. In 2001, SpVgg Unterhaching won the national five-a-side indoor football cup.

The SpVgg Unterhaching also has a very successful bob-sledding team, with multiple world and European titles. The Olympic gold-medalist Christoph Langen is a member.

The volleyball department is just as successful TSV Unterhaching and played for six years in Bundesliga.

==Economics==
Unterhaching is undergoing dynamic development in recent years. Unterhaching is the base for Develey, a manufacturer of mustards and other fine foods, and the headquarters for the chewing gum manufacturer Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company. The company Anton Schrobenhauser has become one of the largest building contractors in Munich and the surrounding areas. The headquarters campus (Campeon) of Infineon Technologies, a global leader in semiconductors, is accessible on foot despite being officially part of the neighboring city of Neubiberg. Several other large service companies are also headquartered in Unterhaching, such as Sportscheck formerly part of Otto Group and now part of Signa Holding as well as software firms, e.g. InterFace AG

==Geothermal plant==
Unterhaching began construction on a geothermal power plant called Geothermie Unterhaching in 2004. The plant was the first industrial-scaled project in Germany to use the Kalina cycle. The drilling works lasted about six month for each of the two boreholes. While the first drill hole was finished in fall 2004, the second was completed in winter 2007. The plant became operational in the winter of 2007/2008. The plant was shut down in 2017, as temperature fluctuations meant it could only generate power effectively in the summer.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Unterhaching is twinned with:
* Adeje, Spain
* Bischofshofen, Austria
* Le Vésinet, France
* Witney, England, United Kingdom
* Żywiec, Poland

<doc id="391190" wikidata="Q4895359" url="?curid=391190" title="Right of conquest">
<text>The right of conquest was historically a right of ownership to land after immediate possession via force of arms. It was recognized as a principle of international law that gradually deteriorated in significance until its proscription in the aftermath of World War II following the concept of crimes against peace introduced in the Nuremberg Principles. The interdiction of territorial conquests was confirmed and broadened by the UN Charter, which provides in article 2, paragraph 4, that &quot;All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.&quot; Nations that have resorted to the use of force since the Charter came into effect have typically invoked self-defense or the right of collective defense.

==History and arguments==

Proponents state that the right of conquest acknowledges the status quo, and that denial of the right is meaningless unless one is able and willing to use military force to deny it. Further, the right was traditionally accepted because the conquering force, being by definition stronger than any lawfully entitled governance which it may have replaced, was, therefore, more likely to secure peace and stability for the people, and so the right of conquest legitimizes the conqueror towards that end.

The completion of colonial conquest of much of the world (see the Scramble for Africa), the devastation of World War I and World War II, and the alignment of both the United States and the Soviet Union with the principle of self-determination led to the abandonment of the right of conquest in formal international law. The 1928 Kellogg–Briand Pact, the post-1945 Nuremberg and Tokyo Trials, the UN Charter, and the UN role in decolonization saw the progressive dismantling of this principle. The UN Charter&#x27;s guarantees the &quot;territorial integrity&quot; of member states, but enforcement difficulties in the 21st century lead to a contentious debate on possible re-emergence of the right of conquest as international law.

==Conquest and military occupation==
Until 1945, the disposition of territory acquired under the principle of conquest had to be conducted according to the existing laws of war. This meant that there had to be military occupation followed by a peace settlement, and there was no reasonable chance of the defeated sovereign regaining the land. While a formal peace treaty &quot;makes good any defects in title&quot;, it was not required. Recognition by the losing party was not a requirement: &quot;the right of acquisition vested by conquest did not depend on the consent of the dispossessed state&quot;. However, the alternative was annexation (part or in whole) which if protested as unlawful, a peace treaty was the only means to legitimize conquest in a time of war. Essentially, conquest itself was a legal act of extinguishing the legal rights of other states without their consent. Under this framework, it is notable that conquest and subsequent occupation outside of war were illegal.

In the post-World War II era, not all wars involving territorial acquisitions ended in a peace treaty. For example, the fighting in the Korean War paused with an armistice, without any peace treaty covering it. As of 2025, North Korea is still technically at war with South Korea and the United States.

<text>Kettler () is a German company based in Ense-Parsit. The company produces riding toys, leisure gear, patio furniture and exercise equipment.

==History==
The company was founded in 1949 in Parsit by Heinz Kettler. Originally starting in the attic of a sawmill, Kettler grew into a worldwide manufacturing and distribution organization, selling products in over 60 countries. In 2005, Heinz Kettler died and his daughter Karin took over the company. The CEO is Ludger Busche.

The company filed for bankruptcy under own management (similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy) to avoid an uncontrolled takeover by an investor. The bicycle unit was subsequently sold to ZEG (Zweirad Einkaufs Genossenschaft) in December 2015, and the company exited the bankruptcy proceedings in March 2016. Karin Kettler, who had mostly retired from the day to day business, died in a traffic accident in March 2017, aged 57.

The company filed for bankruptcy again in July 2018, and the court opened the bankruptcy proceedings again in October 2018. On October 11, 2019, the end of the company was decided, and the employees were informed about this on October 14. Production officially ended at the end of January 2020.

==Products==
In 1949, Kettler started producing patio furniture and added the Kettcar toy car to their inventory in 1962.

In 1977, Kettler added aluminium bicycles to their product line and started producing fitness equipment and table tennis tops soon after. Kettler now sells a full line of children&#x27;s toys, from push trikes for toddlers to licensed pedal tractors for children.

===Toys===
====Kettcar====
The Kettcar was introduced in 1962 as Kettler&#x27;s first pedal vehicle. Similar to a bicycle, the pedals turn the wheels over a chain. The Kettcar, however, has four wheels and requires no balancing to ride. Since its debut, Kettler has made many different varieties of the Kettcar and has sold more than 15 million of them worldwide.

The popularity of the Kettcar in Germany is so immense that the word &quot;Kettcar&quot; has become a synonym for four wheeled pedal cars and was entered into the &quot;Duden&quot;, the official German dictionary, describing it as a &quot;pedal powered chain vehicle for children&quot; The first four letters of the word Kettcar are derived from the company &quot;Kettler&quot; and the German word for chain, &quot;Kette&quot;. The last three letters are derived from the word &quot;car&quot;.

====Licensed pedal vehicles====
Next to their own brand name, Kettler produces and sells pedal vehicles under the license of multiple other companies. Kettler is the sole producer of CAT, Case, Massey Ferguson and New Holland pedal tractors.

===Table tennis tables===

Kettler produces a number of table tennis tables, that are tournament bounce certified. In January 1996, the committee of the Olympics in Atlanta chose Kettler as the official provider for table tennis gear for the summer games. Kettler still manufactures and sells the same table that was used in the Olympics under the name &quot;Atlanta&quot;.

===Bicycles===
Kettler started manufacturing aluminium bicycles in 1977. The bicycle unit was sold in 2015; ZEG as the new owners continue to manufacture the bicycles under the &quot;Kettler Alurad&quot; brand.

===Fitness===
Kettler has a fitness equipment line, ranging from exercise bikes and crosstrainers to treadmills and rowers.

===Furniture===
Having its roots in building furniture, Kettler continued producing it and expanded its selection to aluminum, wrought iron, resin and teak wood furniture. Kettler produces furniture mainly for outdoor use.

<doc id="391206" wikidata="Q705530" url="?curid=391206" title="Art Ensemble of Chicago">
<text>The Art Ensemble of Chicago is an avant-garde jazz group that grew out of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) in the late 1960s. The ensemble integrates many jazz styles and plays many instruments, including &quot;little instruments&quot;: bells, bicycle horns, birthday party noisemakers, wind chimes, and various forms of percussion. The musicians would wear costumes and face paint while performing. These characteristics combined to make the ensemble&#x27;s performances both aural and visual. While playing in Europe in 1969, five hundred instruments were used.

==History==
Members of what was to become the Art Ensemble performed together under various band names in the mid-sixties, as members of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). They performed on the 1966 album &quot;Sound,&quot; as the Roscoe Mitchell Sextet. The Sextet included saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell, trumpeter Lester Bowie, and bassist Malachi Favors. For the next year, they played as the Roscoe Mitchell Art Ensemble. In 1967, they were joined by fellow AACM members Joseph Jarman (saxophone) and Phillip Wilson (drums) and recorded for Nessa Records.

All of the musicians were multi-instrumentalists. Jarman and Mitchell&#x27;s primary instruments were alto and tenor saxophone, respectively, Additionally, they both played other saxophones ranging from the small sopranino to the large bass saxophone, as well as the flute and clarinet. In addition to trumpet, Bowie played flugelhorn, cornet, shofar, and conch shells. Favors added touches of banjo and bass guitar. Most of them dabbled in piano, synthesizer, and other keyboards, and they all played percussion instruments.

They were known for wearing costumes and makeup on stage. Member Joseph Jarman described part of their style: 

In 1967, Wilson left the group to join Paul Butterfield&#x27;s band, and for a period the group was a quartet without a full-time drummer. Jarman and Mitchell served as artistic directors at the cooperative summer camp Circle Pines Center in Delton, Michigan, in August of 1968, during the same week that the Democratic Convention was in Chicago. After a farewell concert at the Unitarian Church in Evanston, Illinois, in fall, 1968, the remaining group traveled to Paris. In Paris, the ensemble was based at the Théâtre des Vieux Colombier.
 In France, they became known as the Art Ensemble of Chicago. The impetus for the name change came from a French promoter who added &quot;of Chicago&quot; to their name for descriptive purposes. The new name stuck because band members felt that it better reflected the cooperative nature of the group. In Paris, the ensemble was based at the Théâtre des Vieux Colombier and they recorded for the Freedom and BYG labels. They also recorded &quot;Comme à la radio&quot; with Brigitte Fontaine and Areski Belkacem but without a drummer until percussionist Don Moye became a member of the group in 1970. During that year, they recorded the albums &quot;Art Ensemble of Chicago with Fontella Bass&quot; and &quot;Les Stances a Sophie&quot; with singer Fontella Bass, who was Lester Bowie&#x27;s wife. The latter was the soundtrack to the French movie of the same title.
===Fifty years on===
Lester Bowie died of liver cancer in 1999. Malachi Favors died in 2004 of pancreatic cancer. Joseph Jarman died on January 9, 2019, of respiratory failure.

As of 2017-2019 Mitchell and Moye remained active, with new and previous collaborators as guest under the name &quot;Art Ensemble of Chicago - 50th Anniversary Large Ensemble&quot;. They released an album in 2019:

<text>Anatoli Nikolaevich Boukreev (; January 16, 1958 – December 25, 1997) was a Soviet-born Kazakh mountaineer who made ascents of 10 of the 14 eight-thousander peaks—those above —without supplemental oxygen. From 1989 through 1997, he made 18 successful ascents of peaks above 8,000 m.

Boukreev had a reputation as an elite mountaineer in international climbing circles for summiting K2 in 1993 and Mount Everest via the North Ridge route in 1995, and for his solo speed ascents of some of the world&#x27;s highest mountains. He became even more widely known for saving the lives of climbers during the 1996 Mount Everest disaster. 

In 1997, Boukreev was killed in an avalanche during a winter ascent of Annapurna in Nepal. Boukreev&#x27;s companion, Linda Wylie, edited his memoirs and published them in 2002 under the title, &quot;Above the Clouds: The Diaries of a High-Altitude Mountaineer&quot;.

==Biography==
Boukreev was born in Korkino, within the Soviet Union&#x27;s Russian SFSR. He came from the &quot;narod&quot;, the common people, and his parents were both poor. After completing high school in 1975, he attended Chelyabinsk University for Pedagogy, where he majored in physics and earned his Bachelor of Science degree in 1979. At the same time, he also completed a coaching program for cross-country skiing.

After graduation, the 21-year-old dreamed of mountain climbing. Boukreev moved to Alma-Ata, the capital of the neighbouring Kazakh SSR (present-day Kazakhstan) located in the Tian Shan mountain range. From 1985 he was part of a Kazakhstani mountaineering team, and he became a citizen of Kazakhstan in 1991 after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

Boukreev worked as a commercial mountain guide in the 1990s, and was working with Scott Fischer&#x27;s adventure company Mountain Madness during the 1996 Mount Everest disaster. He managed to survive and was also instrumental in saving the lives of others, including New York socialite Sandy Hill Pittman.

===Denali===
In May 1990, Boukreev was invited by an American climber to guide several clients to the summit of Denali in Alaska. Denali, previously known as Mount McKinley, has challenges such as hidden crevasses and unpredictably cold weather due to its proximity to the Arctic Circle and the ocean.

The expedition was a success, and the team reached the summit and returned without incident. During the climb, there had been somewhat of a language barrier, and Boukreev felt the sting of needing to borrow equipment due to his economic circumstances. After the team had returned home, Boukreev decided to attempt a solo speed ascent of Denali before returning to the Soviet Union.

Boukreev&#x27;s solo speed ascent of Denali in 1990 was completed in 10½ hours from the base to the summit. That season acclimatized climbers were normally taking three to four days and five camps to summit — Boukreev&#x27;s feat was noted by &quot;Climbing&quot; magazine in a 1990 issue, and commented on by Denali Park rangers who described it as &quot;unreal&quot;.

===K2===
In 1993, Boukreev reached the summit of K2 via the Abruzzi Spur, where he shared the peak with team members Peter Metzger of Germany and Andrew Lock of Australia. The other team members were German climbers Reinmar Joswig (the team leader) and Ernst Eberhardt. With a peak elevation of 8,611 metres (28,251 ft), K2 is the second-highest mountain on Earth after Mount Everest.
As part of the Karakoram range, K2 is located on the border between Pakistan and China. K2 is referred to as the &quot;Savage Mountain&quot; — notable for its steep pyramidal relief, dropping quickly in almost all directions, and the inherent danger in climbing it.
The danger facing Boukreev on K2 was that the summit felt like the finish line. Boukreev would later write that he did not feel the emotions of victory in that moment on top of K2&#x27;s peak because he was physically and emotionally spent. Boukreev found himself in a dangerous position. He had expended too much energy placing fixed lines along a narrow, steep portion earlier that day. But since the team wanted to push on to the summit that same afternoon, rather than return to their tents to sleep and make a summit bid the next morning, Boukreev acquiesced. Boukreev would later write:
Boukreev later described feeling like a &quot;squeezed lemon&quot;. When Boukreev and the other two climbers began their descent just after sundown they met Reinmar Joswig ascending and near the peak. Relying heavily on intuition and his previous mountaineering experiences, Boukreev slowly made his way down the steep rock and ice of the mountain. A crampon kept coming off of his boot, and at one point he had to use his ice axe to arrest a fall, keeping himself from sliding into the abyss. Eventually he made his way to the tents at the highest elevation camp. However, teammates Peter Metzger and Reinmar Joswig never returned from the summit, both having fallen to their death during the descent.

===Everest===

Boukreev became widely known as the lead climbing guide for the Mountain Madness expedition headed by Scott Fischer in May 1996. The expedition was one of several attempting to summit Everest on the same day (May 10). Soon after summiting on May 10, a disastrous blizzard struck, stranding many climbers above the South Col overnight, and by May 11, eight climbers from three different expeditions had perished. Boukreev rescued three climbers stranded in the disaster above 8,000 m, and all six of the climbing clients on the Mountain Madness expedition survived the ordeal.

Galen Rowell described Boukreev&#x27;s rescue efforts in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; as:
==Controversy==
Author Jon Krakauer was generally critical of Boukreev in his book, &quot;Into Thin Air.&quot; Subsequently, Boukreev was contacted by various media for a response, and also wrote his own account of the events on Everest in &quot;The Climb&quot;, a book co-written with Gary Weston DeWalt.

The core of the controversy was Boukreev&#x27;s decision to attempt the summit without supplementary oxygen and to descend to the camp ahead of his clients in the face of approaching darkness and blizzard. He was one of the first to reach the summit on the day of the disaster and stayed at or near the summit for nearly 1.5 hours helping others with their summit efforts, before returning to his tent by 5 pm on May 10, well ahead of the later summiters on his team.

Boukreev&#x27;s supporters point to the fact that his return to camp allowed him enough rest that, when the blizzard had subsided around midnight, he was able to mount a rescue attempt and to lead several climbers still stranded on the mountain back to the safety of the camp. Boukreev&#x27;s detractors say that had he simply stayed with the clients, he would have been in better position to assist them down the mountain, though every one of Boukreev&#x27;s clients survived, including the three (Pittman, Fox, Madsen) that he rescued on May 11 after he had rested and overcome hypoxia. The only client deaths that day were suffered by the Adventure Consultants expedition, led by guide Rob Hall, who lost his own life when he chose to stay and help a client summit the mountain past the safe turnaround time of 14:00. Reinhold Messner criticized Boukreev, saying &quot;[n]o one should guide Everest without using bottled oxygen&quot; while David Breashears pointed out that Boukreev, despite climbing down first, was &quot;sitting in his tent unable to assist anyone&quot; until the clients themselves staggered into the camp with the information vital to their rescue.

According to Krakauer, Boukreev&#x27;s &quot;refusal or inability to play the role of a conventional guide&quot; caused dissension between him and Scott Fischer (who later died while returning from the summit). On the way to the summit, Fischer had directed Boukreev to bring up the rear of the group and keep an eye on everybody, but he instead remained at Base Camp and followed the group some five hours later. When a client named Dale Kruse fell ill, Boukreev was nowhere to be found, forcing Fischer to descend from Camp II to Kruse and help him back to Base Camp. According to Krakauer, Fischer encountered Boukreev at the Khumbu Icefall and &quot;harshly reprimanded the guide for shirking his responsibilities&quot;. Back at Base Camp, Fischer called his Seattle business partner Karen Dickinson and publicist Jane Bromet to complain about Boukreev&#x27;s actions before resuming his ascent.

Before returning to the U.S. after the events on Everest in 1996, Boukreev climbed the Lhotse, which is in proximity to Everest. He decided on a solo ascent because he hoped that in the process of climbing it he might find some inner clarity to what had just transpired on Everest.

In 1997 Anatoli Boukreev was awarded the David A. Sowles Memorial Award by the American Alpine Club. The award recognizes people &quot;who have distinguished themselves, with unselfish devotion at personal risk or sacrifice of a major objective, in going to the assistance of fellow climbers imperiled in the mountains. It is dedicated to the memory of David A. Sowles.&quot; It was presented to him by Jim Wickwire, the first American to summit K2. The award is the American Alpine Club&#x27;s highest award for valor in recognition of his role in rescuing climbers in the 1996 Everest disaster.

==Death==
Three weeks after receiving the David A. Sowles Memorial Award, Boukreev began his attempt to climb the south face of Annapurna I () along with Simone Moro, an accomplished Italian mountaineer. They were accompanied by Dimitri Sobolev, a cinematographer from Kazakhstan who was documenting the attempt. On December 25 around noon, Boukreev and Moro were fixing ropes in a couloir at around the level. 

Suddenly, an enormous cornice broke loose from the heights of Annapurna&#x27;s Western Wall and rumbled down the long couloir. The avalanche knocked Moro down the mountain where he landed just above their tent at Camp I . Fortuitously, Moro had somehow stayed near the top of the avalanche debris and managed to dig himself out after a few minutes. Unable to see or hear any signs of Boukreev or Sobolev (whom Moro had witnessed disappearing beneath &quot;car-sized blocks of ice&quot;), Moro descended to Annapurna base camp where he was flown by helicopter back to Kathmandu for surgery on his hands, which had been ripped down to the tendons during the fall.

News of the accident reached New Mexico on December 26. Linda Wylie, Boukreev&#x27;s girlfriend, left for Nepal on December 28. Several attempts were made to reach the avalanche site by helicopter but inclement weather in late December prevented search teams from reaching Camp I. On January 3, 1998, searchers were finally able to reach Camp I and an empty tent. Linda Wylie subsequently issued a somber statement from Kathmandu:
This is the end... there are no hopes of finding him alive.

Boukreev had dreamt in detail of dying in an avalanche nine months before his death. The only thing missing was the name of the mountain. When Boukreev&#x27;s companion tried to convince him to take a different path in life to avoid a fate that Boukreev was convinced of, he responded, &quot;Mountains are my life...my work. It is too late for me to take up another road.&quot;

===Memorial===
At the site of Annapurna base-camp there is a memorial chorten to Boukreev including one of his favorite quotes:&quot;Mountains are not stadiums where I satisfy my ambition to achieve, they are the cathedrals where I practice my religion.&quot;

On January 18, 2023, a sculpture of Boukreev by Nurlan Dalbai was unveiled at the Medeu ice sports rink. The mountaineer is shown at rest with his hand on an ice axe.

Boukreev Summit (3010m) near Almaty, Kazakhstan is named after Boukreev. 

==In popular culture==
Icelandic actor Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson portrays Boukreev in the Baltasar Kormákur film, &quot;Everest&quot;, about the 1996 Everest disaster.

<text>Patrick Joseph McGoohan (; March 19, 1928 – January 13, 2009) was an Irish-American actor of film, television, and theatre. Born in New York City to Irish parents, he was raised in Ireland and England. He began his career in England during the 1950s and became well known for the titular role of secret agent John Drake in the ITC espionage programme &quot;Danger Man&quot; (1960–1968). He then created, produced, and starred as former British intelligence agent Number Six in the surrealistic ITV series &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1967–1968).

Beginning in the 1970s, McGoohan maintained a long-running association with the television series &quot;Columbo&quot;, writing, directing, producing and appearing in several episodes. His notable film roles included David Jones in &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; (1968); James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray in &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971); the Warden in &quot;Escape from Alcatraz&quot; (1979); Dr. Paul Ruth in &quot;Scanners&quot; (1981); Edward I of England in &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995); Judge Omar Noose in &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; (1996); and the voice of Billy Bones in &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002).

During the height of &quot;Danger Man&quot;″s fame in the 1960s, McGoohan was the highest-paid actor on British television. McGoohan won the 1960 BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor for his work on &quot;Danger Man&quot;, and twice won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series, including its inaugural 1975 entry, for roles on &quot;Columbo&quot;.

==Early life==
Patrick Joseph McGoohan was born in Astoria, Queens, New York City on March 19, 1928, to Irish Catholic immigrant parents Thomas McGoohan and Rose McGoohan (née Fitzpatrick). Soon after he was born, the family returned to Ireland, settling in the Mullaghmore area of Carrigallen, County Leitrim.

Seven years later, they relocated to England, settling in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire. McGoohan attended St Marie&#x27;s School, then St Vincent&#x27;s School, and De La Salle College, all in Sheffield. During World War II, he was evacuated to Loughborough, where he attended Ratcliffe College at the same time as future actor Ian Bannen. McGoohan excelled in mathematics and boxing, and left school at the age of 16 to return to Sheffield, where he worked as a chicken farmer, bank clerk, and lorry driver before getting a job as a stage manager for Sheffield Repertory Theatre. When one of the actors became ill, McGoohan substituted for him, which began his acting career.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1955, McGoohan featured in a West End stage production of &quot;Serious Charge&quot;, as a Church of England vicar accused of being homosexual.

&quot;Intimidated&quot; by McGoohan&#x27;s stage presence, Orson Welles cast him as Starbuck in his York theatre production of &quot;Moby Dick—Rehearsed&quot;. Welles said in 1969 that he believed McGoohan &quot;would now be, I think, one of the big actors of our generation if TV hadn&#x27;t grabbed him,&quot; reflecting that he had &quot;all the required attributes, looks, intensity, unquestionable acting ability and a twinkle in his eye&quot;.

McGoohan&#x27;s first television appearance was as Charles Stewart Parnell in &quot;The Fall of Parnell&quot; for the series &quot;You Are There&quot; (1954). He had an uncredited role in the movie &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955), standing guard outside a briefing room. He delivered the line, &quot;Sorry, old boy, it&#x27;s secret—you can&#x27;t go in. Now, c&#x27;mon, hop it!,&quot; which was cut from some prints of the movie.

He also had small roles in &quot;Passage Home&quot; (1955), &quot;The Dark Avenger&quot; (1955) and &quot;I Am A Camera&quot; (1955). He could also be seen in &quot;Zarak&quot; (1956) for Warwick Films. For television he was in &quot;Margin for Error&quot; in &quot;Terminus&quot; (1955), guest featured on &quot;The Adventures of Sir Lancelot&quot; and &quot;Assignment Foreign Legion&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of Aggie&quot;. He played the lead in &quot;The Makepeace Story&quot; for BBC &quot;Sunday Night Theatre&quot; (1955). He also appeared in Welles&#x27; movie version of &quot;Moby Dick—Rehearsed&quot;.

He did &quot;Ring for Catty&quot; on stage in 1956.

===Rank Organisation===
While working as a stand-in during screen tests, McGoohan was signed to a contract with The Rank Organisation. They gave him mostly villainous parts in films, including &quot;High Tide at Noon&quot; (1957), directed by Philip Leacock; &quot;Hell Drivers&quot; (1957), directed by Cy Endfield; and &quot;The Gypsy and the Gentleman&quot; (1958), directed by Joseph Losey.

He had frequent roles in television anthology series such as &quot;Television Playwright&quot;, &quot;Folio&quot;, &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, &quot;ITV Play of the Week&quot; and &quot;ITV Television Playhouse&quot;. He was given a leading role in &quot;Nor the Moon by Night&quot; (1958), filmed in South Africa. After some disputes with Rank management, the contract was dissolved. He then did some TV work, winning a BAFTA in 1960.

His favourite part for stage acting was the lead in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Brand&quot;, for which he received an award. He also played the role in a BBC television production in August 1959. Michael Meyer, who translated the stage version, thought McGoohan&#x27;s performance was the best and most powerful he had ever seen. It was McGoohan&#x27;s last stage appearance for 28 years.

===&quot;Danger Man&quot;===

Production executive Lew Grade soon approached McGoohan about a television series where he would play a spy named John Drake. Having learned from his experience at Rank, McGoohan insisted on several conditions: all the fistfights should be different; the character would always use his brain before using a gun; and—much to the executives&#x27; horror—no kissing. The show debuted in 1960 as &quot;Danger Man&quot;, a half-hour programme intended for American audiences. It did fairly well, but not as well as hoped.

Production lasted a year and 39 episodes. After the first series was over, an interviewer asked McGoohan if he would have liked it to continue. He replied, &quot;Perhaps, but let me tell you this: I would rather do twenty TV series than go through what I went through under that Rank contract I signed a few years ago and for which I blame no one but myself.&quot;

===Post-&quot;Danger Man&quot;===
McGoohan appeared in the movie &quot;Two Living, One Dead&quot; (1961), filmed in Sweden. He featured in two movies directed by Basil Dearden: &quot;All Night Long&quot;, an updating of &quot;Othello&quot;, and &quot;Life for Ruth&quot; (both 1962). He also featured in an adaptation of &quot;The Quare Fellow&quot; (1962) by Brendan Behan.

McGoohan was one of several actors considered for the role of James Bond in &quot;Dr. No&quot;. While McGoohan, a Catholic, refused the role on moral grounds, the success of the Bond films is generally cited as the reason for &quot;Danger Man&quot; being revived. (He was later considered for the same role in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, but refused again.)

McGoohan spent some time working for The Walt Disney Company on &quot;The Three Lives of Thomasina&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot; (1963). A staid English vicar, Dr. Christopher Syn (a reformed pirate captain - played by McGoohan) disguised as a scarecrow and mounted on a magnificent black stallion thwarts King George III&#x27;s Revenue officers in daring night-time smuggling adventures on the remote Kent coast.

===Return of &quot;Danger Man&quot;===
After he had also refused the role of Simon Templar in &quot;The Saint&quot;, Lew Grade asked McGoohan if he wanted to give John Drake another try. This time, McGoohan had even more say about the series. &quot;Danger Man&quot; (&quot;Secret Agent&quot; in the US) was resurrected in 1964 as a one-hour programme. The scripts now allowed McGoohan more range in his acting. Because of the popularity of the series, he became the highest-paid actor in the UK, and the show lasted almost three more years.

After shooting the only two colour episodes of &quot;Danger Man&quot;, McGoohan told Grade that he would quit the role.

===&quot;The Prisoner&quot;===

Knowing McGoohan&#x27;s intention to quit &quot;Danger Man&quot;, Grade asked if he would at least work on &quot;something&quot; for him. McGoohan pitched a miniseries about a secret agent who angrily quits and is abducted to a surreal, cheerful holiday resort village. Grade asked for a budget, McGoohan had one ready, and they made a deal over a handshake early on a Saturday morning to produce &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.

In addition to being the series&#x27; protagonist, McGoohan was its executive producer, forming Everyman Films with producer David Tomblin, and also wrote and directed several episodes, in some cases using pseudonyms. The originally commissioned seven episodes became seventeen.

The title character, the otherwise-unnamed &quot;Number Six&quot;, spends the entire series trying to escape from a mysterious prison community called &quot;The Village&quot;, and to learn the identity of its ruler. The Village&#x27;s administrators try just as much to force or trick him into revealing why he resigned as a spy, which he refuses to divulge. The series&#x27; main exterior filming location was the Italianate resort village of Portmeirion, Gwynedd, Wales, which had been featured in some episodes of &quot;Danger Man&quot;.

===MGM===
During production of &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, MGM cast McGoohan in an action movie, &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; (1968), for which his performance as a British spy drew critical praise.

After the end of &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, he presented a TV show, &quot;Journey into Darkness&quot; (1968–69). He was meant to follow it with the lead role of Dirk Struan in an expensive adaptation of the James Clavell best-seller &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; but the project was cancelled before filming. Instead he made the movie &quot;The Moonshine War&quot; (1970) for MGM.

===1970s===
McGoohan played James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray in &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971). He directed Richie Havens in a rock opera version of &quot;Othello&quot;, entitled &quot;Catch My Soul&quot; (1974), but disliked the experience.

McGoohan received two Emmy Awards for his work for the television series &quot;Columbo&quot;, with his long-time friend Peter Falk. McGoohan said that his first appearance on &quot;Columbo&quot; (in the 1974 episode &quot;By Dawn&#x27;s Early Light&quot;) was probably his favourite American role. He directed five &quot;Columbo&quot; episodes (including three of the four in which he appeared), one of which he also wrote and two of which he also produced. McGoohan was involved with the &quot;Columbo&quot; series in some capacity from 1974 to 2000; his daughter Catherine McGoohan appeared with him in the episode &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; (1998). The other two &quot;Columbo&quot; episodes in which he appeared are &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; (1975) and &quot;Agenda for Murder&quot; (1990).

As he had done early in his career with the Rank Organisation, McGoohan began to specialise in villains, appearing in &quot;A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe&quot; (1975), &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1977).

In 1977, he had the main role of the television series &quot;Rafferty&quot; as a retired army doctor who moves into private practice.

He had the lead in a Canadian movie, &quot;Kings and Desperate Men&quot;; then had supporting parts in &quot;Brass Target&quot; (1978) and the Clint Eastwood movie &quot;Escape from Alcatraz&quot; (1979), portraying the prison&#x27;s warden.

===1980s ===
In 1980 he appeared in the UK television movie &quot;The Hard Way&quot;.

In 1981 he appeared in the science fiction/horror movie &quot;Scanners&quot;, and in &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; (1983) and &quot;Trespasses&quot; (1984).

In 1985 he appeared in his only Broadway production, featuring opposite Rosemary Harris in Hugh Whitemore&#x27;s &quot;Pack of Lies&quot;, in which he played another British spy. He was nominated for a Drama Desk Award as Best Actor for his performance.

He could also be seen in the movies &quot;&quot; (1985) and &quot;Of Pure Blood&quot; (1986) as well as an episode of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;.

===1990s===
McGoohan featured in &quot;The Best of Friends&quot; (1991) , and featured as Edward I of England in &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995) which revitalised his career; he was seen the following year as Judge Omar Noose in &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; and in &quot;The Phantom&quot;, a cinema adaptation of the comic strip.

===2000s===
In 2000, he reprised his role as Number Six in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Computer Wore Menace Shoes&quot;. In it, Homer Simpson concocts a news story to make his website more popular, and he wakes up in a prison disguised as a holiday resort. Dubbed Number Five, he meets Number Six, and later betrays him and escapes with his boat; referencing his numerous attempts to escape on a raft in &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, Number Six splutters &quot;That&#x27;s the third time that&#x27;s happened!&quot;

McGoohan&#x27;s last movie role was the voice of Billy Bones in the Disney animated film &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002). That same year, he received a Prometheus Hall of Fame Award for &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.

McGoohan&#x27;s name was associated with several aborted attempts at producing a new movie version of &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. In 2002, Simon West was signed to direct a version of the story. McGoohan was listed as executive producer for the movie, which never came to fruition. Later, Christopher Nolan was proposed as director for a movie version. However, the source material remained difficult and elusive to adapt into a feature movie. McGoohan was not involved with the project that was ultimately completed. A miniseries was filmed for the AMC network in late 2008, with its broadcast occurring during November 2009.

==Personal life==
McGoohan married actress Joan Drummond on May 19, 1951. They had three children including Catherine McGoohan.

For most of the 1960s they lived in a secluded detached house on the Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London. They settled in the Pacific Palisades district of Los Angeles during the mid-1970s.

==Death==
McGoohan died following a &quot;short illness&quot; at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, on January 13, 2009, at the age of 80.

A biography of McGoohan was published in 2007 by Tomahawk Press, and another followed in 2011 by Supernova Books.

<text>Argenteuil () is a regional county municipality located in the Laurentides region of Quebec, Canada. Its seat is Lachute.

==History==
In 1682, Charles-Joseph d&#x27;Ailleboust was granted by Louis de Buade de Frontenac, Governor General of New France, a domain of of land. This fiefdom was bounded by the Ottawa River to the south, a line through the center of the hamlet of Carillon in the west and Clear Lake (&quot;Lac Clair&quot;) to the north. Since Ailleboust already owned a house in Argenteuil near Paris, he called his domain Argenteuil Seigneury. In 1697, the Lord of Ailleboust and his wife Catherine Le Gardeur sold their seigneury to their son Pierre d&#x27;Ailleboust d&#x27;Argenteuil. Subsequently over the years, the fiefdom was held by Pierre-Louis Panet, and then by Major Murray.

After the conquest of New France by the British in 1759 during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the British implemented their laws, but maintained certain French seigneurial rights. In 1796, Jedediah Lane, from Jericho, Vermont, bought from Major Murray several thousand acres of land on both sides of the North River (&quot;Rivière du Nord&quot;), where Lachute is today. In 1809, Thomas Barron bought the land of the territory that would become the center of the town of Lachute. Five years later, Sir John Johnson, a Loyalist from New York who had resettled in Canada after the American Revolution, bought the rest of the Argenteuil Seigneury. He built a sawmill and gave land for churches, helping to attract new settlers to Argenteuil.

In 1854, the Parliament of the Province of Canada abolished the seigneurial system, and the County of Argenteuil was created the following year. In January 1983, the Argenteuil Regional County Municipality succeeded the County of Argenteuil.

<text>Karin Dor (; born Kätherose Derr; 22 February 1938 – 6 November 2017) was a German actress. She was famous to international audiences for her role as Bond girl Helga Brandt in the James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967) and her appearance in the Alfred Hitchcock thriller &quot;Topaz&quot; (1969).

==Biography==
Dor was born in Wiesbaden on 22 February 1938. She starred in the James Bond movie &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967) and the Alfred Hitchcock movie &quot;Topaz&quot; (1969).

She appeared in German movies adapted from the works of Edgar Wallace (Krimis from Kriminalfilm) and Karl May. These two-film series were mainly directed by Harald Reinl, her first husband. 

In 2008, she was in a Munich stage production, &quot;Man liebt nur dreimal&quot; (&quot;You Only Love Thrice&quot;). In later years, she performed mainly stage roles but still appeared in some films.

She was married three times: her last marriage was to George Robotham, an American stunt director, from 1988 until his death in 2007. The couple lived in Los Angeles and Munich. Her previous marriage was to Harald Reinl (1954–68); the couple had a child. In 1954, the year of their marriage, Dor was 16 years old (born 1938), while Reinl was 46 (born 1908). 

==Accident and death==

In July 2016, while vacationing in South Tyrol, Dor was knocked to the ground after being accidentally rammed by a woman with a stroller. The backwards fall onto concrete resulted in a gashing 4-cm head wound that had to be stitched in hospital. She lost her memory for the duration of an hour. 

According to Dor, the doctors detected neither a brain concussion nor an intracranial injury. Only during rehearsals for the theatre play &quot;Der Dressierte Mann&quot; weeks after her fall did doctors realize her injuries were more serious than previously thought, as she began suffering from headaches and was often tired. Even months past the accident, the aftereffects were still present and Dor was not feeling up to her usual energetic self. Her attitude however remained positive and, despite her doctors advising against it, she continued working as an actress. Between October and November 2016, she appeared on stage every evening performing at the Komödie im Bayerischen Hof in Munich. By that time, she was already experiencing limited motor function in her right leg.

Suddenly, in January 2017, she relapsed. Her condition rapidly worsened in March 2017 and she was confined to a care home, where she ultimately died on 6 November, aged 79.

<doc id="391218" wikidata="Q3180746" url="?curid=391218" title="Canyon towhee">
<text>The canyon towhee (Melozone fusca) is a bird of the family Passerellidae. Until 1989, the canyon towhee and the California towhee were considered to be a single species which was called the brown towhee.

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomy of the group of towhees to which this species belongs is debated. At the higher level, some authors place the towhees in the family Fringillidae. Within the genus, there has been dispute about whether the canyon towhee is a distinct species from the California towhee (&quot;Melozone crissalis&quot;) found in coastal regions from Oregon and California in the United States through Baja California in Mexico. At present, molecular genetics seems to have settled this issue in favour of separation of the species.

==Description==
It is long, and has a noticeably long tail, at . This species weighs from , though on average weigh only around . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . It is earthy brown in color, with somewhat lighter underparts and a somewhat darker head with a rufous cap (except that birds in central Mexico have the cap the same color as the back); there is also a slightly reddish area beneath the tail. There is little sexual dimorphism.

==Distribution and habitat==
The towhee is native to lower-lying areas from Arizona, southern Colorado, New Mexico and western Texas south to northwestern Oaxaca, Mexico, mostly avoiding the coasts. Its natural habitat is brush or chaparral.

==Behavior==
The towhee feeds on the ground or in low scrub rather than in the tree canopy. Near human habitation, it is often seen in parking lots, where it feeds on insects on the cars&#x27; grilles and takes cover under the cars when disturbed.

<text>Jeffrey Franklin Kent (born March 7, 1968) is an American former professional baseball second baseman. He played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1992 to 2008 for the Toronto Blue Jays, New York Mets, Cleveland Indians, San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Los Angeles Dodgers.

Kent won the National League Most Valuable Player award in 2000 with the San Francisco Giants, and is the all-time leader in home runs among second basemen. He drove in 90 or more runs from 1997 to 2005. Kent is a five-time All-Star, and his 560 career doubles put him in 30th on the all-time doubles list.

Kent attended the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), where he played college baseball for the Golden Bears before being selected in the 20th round of the 1989 MLB draft by the Blue Jays.

==Early life==
Born in Bellflower, California, Kent graduated from Edison High School in Huntington Beach, California, where he was dismissed from the baseball team after clashing with his coach over a position change.

==College career==
Kent played college baseball at UC Berkeley from 1987 to 1989. In 1988 he played both collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League and the College World Series.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Kent was selected in the 20th round of the 1989 MLB Draft by the Toronto Blue Jays.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1992)===
After three seasons in the minor leagues, Kent was invited to spring training with the Blue Jays in 1992 and made the opening day roster. He made his debut on April 12 against the Baltimore Orioles and recorded his first career hit in his first career at-bat, a double in the 6th inning against José Mesa. He hit his first home run on April 14 against New York Yankees pitcher Lee Guetterman. He saw limited at-bats early in the season; however, an injury to starting third baseman Kelly Gruber granted Kent a more regular role in the line-up.

===New York Mets (1992–1996)===
Kent was traded to the Mets on August 27, 1992, for pitcher David Cone, as Toronto bolstered their pitching rotation for a successful World Series run; Kent earned a World Series ring despite the trade. Kent&#x27;s time with the Mets was marked with some success and some failure. Although he batted well, particularly for a second baseman, the Mets were among the worst teams in the National League. Furthermore, he acquired a very poor reputation in the clubhouse, where he was known for a quick temper and isolationism. He refused to participate in his hazing ritual with the Mets, feeling he had left his rookie status back in Toronto. During the 1992 season, he started the only game of his career at shortstop in order to allow Willie Randolph to play his final career game at second base.

===Cleveland Indians (1996)===
In a deal made prior to the 1996 trade deadline, the Mets sent Kent and José Vizcaíno to the Cleveland Indians for Álvaro Espinoza and Carlos Baerga. The following offseason, Kent was again traded, this time to the San Francisco Giants along with José Vizcaíno and Julián Tavárez. The San Francisco trade was initially very unpopular, as it sent Matt Williams, a longtime Giant and a fan-favorite, to the Indians. Brian Sabean, in his first year as general manager of the Giants, was so widely criticized for the move that he famously defended himself to the media by saying, &quot;I am not an idiot.&quot;

===San Francisco Giants (1997–2002)===

Kent&#x27;s career took off in San Francisco, starting in 1997. Immediately inserted in the line-up behind superstar Barry Bonds, and with the confidence of manager Dusty Baker, Kent finally rose to his full potential, hitting .250 with 29 home runs and 121 RBI. He was consistently among the top RBI hitters in the league over his next five seasons with the Giants, amassing 689 RBI over six years. He also won the 1998 Willie Mac Award for his spirit and leadership. Kent&#x27;s contributions were recognized in 2000 (33 home runs, 125 RBI, .334 batting average, and a .986 fielding percentage) with the National League MVP Award, beating out teammate and perennial MVP candidate Barry Bonds. Despite the fact that Bonds overshadowed Kent in almost every offensive category, it was Kent&#x27;s clutch hitting in RBI spots that won many games for the Giants that year, and ultimately won him the award. The Giants finished first in the NL West at 97–65, but lost to the Mets in the National League Division Series 3–1.

In 2002, Kent had another stellar year for a second baseman (37 home runs, 108 RBI, .313 batting average, and a .978 fielding percentage). The combination of Kent and MVP-winner Bonds propelled the Giants to a 95–66 record, good enough for the NL Wild Card. The Giants would beat the Atlanta Braves in the National League Division Series 3–2 and the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series 4–1. In the World Series for the first time since 1989, the Giants would nearly clinch the championship (failing to hold a 5–0, 7th-inning lead) in the sixth game, before falling to the Anaheim Angels in seven games. Despite the team&#x27;s success that season, Kent&#x27;s relationship with the Giants had soured. The Giants front office had lost confidence in Kent after an incident during spring training left him with a broken wrist. Kent had initially claimed that he had broken his wrist after slipping and falling while washing his truck; ensuing media reports indicated that, in reality, Kent had crashed his motorcycle while performing wheelies and other stunts, in direct violation of his contract.

During his time with the San Francisco Giants, Kent was involved in a well-documented incident of racial hostility directed towards his teammate Tsuyoshi Shinjo. According to reports, Kent exhibited a &quot;white supremacist&quot; attitude, particularly in relation to minority players like Shinjo, who was Japanese. It was said that Kent and other white players ostracized players of color, including catcher Benito Santiago and Shinjo, whom they viewed as part of a group with Bonds. Shinjo himself faced direct hostility from Kent, who, upon encountering Japanese media during interviews, would often stop speaking and make derogatory comments such as, &quot;I won’t talk because the Japanese media only wants to cover Shinjo,&quot; and &quot;Leave now.&quot; These interactions reflected a broader atmosphere of tension and discrimination within the team during that period. This behavior reportedly led to strained relations between Kent and Shinjo, adding to the internal conflicts within the Giants&#x27; clubhouse at the time.

In addition, growing tension that had been developing between Kent and Bonds for years finally boiled over: a midseason fight in the Giants dugout was widely reported in 2002 and caught on television. The feud between the two was so bad that, at the end of the season, San Francisco Chronicle beat reporter Ray Ratto said of the two, &quot;The one who lives longer will attend the other&#x27;s funeral, just to make sure he&#x27;s dead.&quot; The departure of manager Dusty Baker also factored into Kent&#x27;s eventual decision to leave the Giants.

===Houston Astros (2003–2004)===
During the 2002 offseason, Kent signed a two-year, $19.9 million deal with the Houston Astros, citing his desire to be closer to his family&#x27;s Texas ranch.
Kent turned one of the outs and collected an assist during a triple play on August 19, 2004, against Philadelphia, when Todd Pratt grounded out with the bases loaded in the fifth inning. Kent forced Marlon Byrd out at second base before throwing Pratt out at first base. It was Houston&#x27;s first triple play turned in 13 years.

From May 14 to June 11, he collected a hit in 25 straight games, which set a new franchise record; Willy Taveras topped his mark in 2006. On October 2, 2004, he hit his 288th home run as a second baseman, surpassing Ryne Sandberg as the all-time home run leader at that position. In Game 5 of the 2004 National League Championship Series, Kent hit a three-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth to break a scoreless tie and put Houston ahead of the St. Louis Cardinals three games to two in the series. However, the Cardinals would win Games 6 and 7 in St. Louis to capture the pennant.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2005–2008)===

On December 14, 2004, he signed a $21 million contract for three years with his hometown Los Angeles Dodgers. Kent started at second base for the National League in the 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Comerica Park, his fifth career All-Star selection and fourth career All-Star start. Kent became the first player in the history of the Dodgers–Giants rivalry to make and start the Midsummer Classic for both clubs. Joc Pederson has since joined this list. Kent had a good 2005 season, leading the Dodgers in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging, runs, hits, doubles, home runs and RBI (.289, .377, .512, 100, 160, 36, 29, and 105 respectively). While missing games early on in the 2006 season because of an oblique injury, he came back late in the season and helped the Dodgers reach the postseason. After the 2005 season, Kent signed an extension that would take him to the 2008 season. His last major league at-bat took place on October 15, 2008 in game five of the 2008 NLCS, in which he struck out looking against Cole Hamels to end the 7th inning. Following 2008, Kent announced his retirement from baseball on January 22, 2009.

===Career statistics===
In 2,298 games over 17 seasons, Kent posted a .290 batting average (2461-for-8498) with 1320 runs, 560 doubles, 47 triples, 377 home runs, 1518 RBI, 94 stolen bases, 801 bases on balls, .356 on-base percentage and .500 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .978 fielding percentage. In 49 postseason games, he hit .276 (47-for-170) with 25 runs, 11 doubles, 9 home runs, 23 RBI and 13 walks. Kent hit 351 home runs as a second baseman, the most in MLB history in either league; he is one of only two second baseman to hit 300 home runs at the position of second base.

==Post-playing career==
Kent and his wife Dana reside near Austin, Texas, where they raise their four children, a daughter and three sons. He also owns the &quot;Diamond K&quot; cattle ranch near Tilden, Texas. In 2008, Kent purchased the Lakecliff Country Club in Spicewood, Texas. Kent also owns Kent Powersports, a chain of motorcycle and ATV dealerships.

Kent appeared as a contestant on the Summer 2009 television series &quot;Superstars&quot;, where he was teamed with actress Ali Landry in a series of sports competitions. They finished in fifth place in the competition. In 2012, Kent participated in &quot;&quot;, the 25th season of the American CBS competitive reality television series &quot;Survivor&quot;. He was the ninth contestant voted off, which placed him tenth and made him the second member of the jury, giving him a right to vote for the eventual winner at the Final Tribal Council. When he was voted off, Kent claimed that the million dollar prize was &quot;six hundred grand by the time Obama takes it&quot;.

He has been an advocate for Major League Baseball using blood tests for HGH. Since 2011, Kent has served as a spring training instructor for the San Francisco Giants. He also coaches his sons&#x27; Little League teams, and in 2014 he became a volunteer assistant for Southwestern University&#x27;s baseball team. In 2011, Kent donated $100,000 and raised awareness to help reinstate the Cal baseball program, which was being cut for cost-saving purposes. In 2014, Kent announced the creation of the Jeff Kent Women Driven Scholarship Endowment to provide a full scholarship each year to one female student-athlete at UC Berkeley in perpetuity.

In 2008, Kent donated to the campaign to ban same-sex marriage in California.

===National Baseball Hall of Fame consideration===
Eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame for the first time in 2014, Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) voters gave Kent just 15.2% of their votes in his first year, well short of the 75% required for induction. Among 17 returnees to the ballot in 2015, Kent was one of only three who saw a decrease in support, dropping to 14.0%. His support increased in subsequent elections, reaching 32.7% in 2022, his ninth appearance on the ballot. In 2023, his tenth and final appearance on the BBWAA ballot, he received 46.5%, falling short of the necessary threshold. Kent&#x27;s underperformance relative to his offensive prowess has been attributed to poor defense, the tainted era he played in, and his reputation as a negative presence in the locker room.

==Personal life==

Kent and his wife, Dana, are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His daughter, Lauren, and his eldest son, Hunter, both attended Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. Lauren graduated from BYU in December 2017, and Hunter played on the practice squad for the Cougars, before taking leave to serve a two-year mission in Mexico.

Kent&#x27;s son, Colton, played his prep baseball at Lake Travis High School, in Austin, Texas. Colton signed to play college baseball at BYU, but transferred to the College of Southern Idaho (CSI) after a year at BYU.

Kent&#x27;s other son, Kaeden, currently plays baseball at Texas A&amp;M University.

<doc id="391224" wikidata="Q4850539" url="?curid=391224" title="Baldwin DR-12-8-1500/2">
<text>The Baldwin DR-12-8-1500/2 (known informally as the &quot;Centipede&quot;) was the Baldwin Locomotive Works&#x27; first serious attempt at a production road diesel locomotive. The Baldwin type designation was ″&quot;DR-12-8-1500/2&quot;,″ meaning Diesel Road locomotive, with 12 axles (8 of which were driven), and two engines of  each. The trucks were configured in a 2-D+D-2 wheel arrangement. The nickname came from the numerous axles set in a nearly unbroken line, much like the legs of a centipede.

==History==
Built between December 1945 and July 1948, the &quot;Babyface&quot; design reflected Baldwin steam and electric locomotive practice. The carbody rode on two massive articulated cast steel half-frames cast by General Steel Castings, linked at the middle with a hinged joint. Unpowered four-wheel trucks at each end guided the locomotive through curves for stability at speed. Internal wiring was passed through metal conduits exactly like those used on a steam locomotive, which proved troublesome in practice.

The prototype 2-unit set was built in 1945 and toured American railroads. Orders followed from the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, and the National Railways of Mexico (NdeM). The two demonstrators (originally ordered by Union Pacific Railroad as #998 and #999) were never sold and were eventually scrapped. The &quot;Centipedes&quot; were essentially obsolete during production, unable to compete with the more advanced locomotive design and technology offered by EMD. 

Reliability was an ongoing problem, and as they were built one at a time (like steam locomotives) each one was a bit different in the placement of wiring and equipment, which complicated even routine maintenance. The PRR units were eventually derated and relegated to helper service. Most PRR and SAL units were scrapped by the early 1960s, while NdeM units lasted slightly longer and were in service until the late 1960s. No Centipedes have been preserved.

The models manufactured for Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México (NdeM) were sent back to Baldwin shops to receive the MU receptacles in order to work in a trailing position with other locomotives. Those Mexican Centipedes end their days as Helper Service in División San Luis, for the &quot;Carneros&quot; hill.

==Original buyers==
==Other information==
In 1943 Baldwin built an experimental &quot;Centipede&quot; as a demonstrator unit, which was assigned road #6000. The uniquely styled unit, with its upright, aggressive prow, also utilized the 2-D+D-2 wheel arrangement, but was to be powered with eight V8 8LV diesel engines, though only four were actually installed. The lone unit was classified by Baldwin as the 
4-8-8-4-750/8DE1 and scrapped soon after production, and its running gear was used for the Seaboard Air Line’s first centipede #4500.

<doc id="391225" wikidata="Q251668" url="?curid=391225" title="Province of Quebec (1763–1791)">
<text>The Province of Quebec () was a colony in British North America which comprised the former French colony of Canada. It was established by the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1763, following the conquest of New France by British forces during the Seven Years&#x27; War. As part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris, France gave up its claim to the colony; it instead negotiated to keep the small profitable island of Guadeloupe. 

Following the Royal Proclamation of 1763, Canada was renamed the Province of Quebec, and from 1774 extended from the coast of Labrador on the Atlantic Ocean, southwest through the Saint Lawrence River Valley to the Great Lakes and beyond to the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers in the Illinois Country. Portions of its southwest, those areas south of the Great Lakes, were later ceded to the newly established United States in the 1783 Treaty of Paris at the conclusion of the American Revolution; although the British maintained a military presence there until 1796 and the Jay Treaty. In 1791, the territory north of the Great Lakes was reorganised and divided into Lower Canada and Upper Canada.

==History==
Under the Proclamation, Quebec included the cities of Quebec and Montreal, as well as a zone surrounding them, but did not extend as far west as the Great Lakes or as far north as Rupert&#x27;s Land.

In 1774, the Parliament of Great Britain passed the Quebec Act that allowed Quebec to restore the use of French customary law () in private matters alongside the English common law system, and allowing the Catholic Church to collect tithes. The act also enlarged the boundaries of Quebec to include the Ohio Country and part of the Illinois Country, from the Appalachian Mountains on the east, south to the Ohio River, west to the Mississippi River and north to the southern boundary of lands owned by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, or Rupert&#x27;s Land.

Western District was one of four districts of the Province of Quebec created in 1788 in the western reaches of the Montreal District which were later detached in 1791 to create the new colony of Upper Canada. Known as Hesse District (named after Hesse in Germany) until 1792.

Through Quebec, the British Crown retained access to the Ohio and Illinois Countries after the Treaty of Paris (1783) ceded control of this land to the United States. By well-established trade and military routes across the Great Lakes, the British continued to supply not only their own troops but a wide alliance of Native American nations through Detroit, Fort Niagara, Fort Michilimackinac, and so on, until these posts were turned over to the United States following the Jay Treaty (1794).

Quebec retained its seigneurial system after the conquest. Owing to an influx of Loyalist refugees from the American Revolutionary War, the demographics of Quebec came to shift and now included a substantial English-speaking Protestant element from the former Thirteen Colonies. These United Empire Loyalists settled mainly in the Eastern Townships, Montreal, and what was known then as the pays d&#x27;en haut west of the Ottawa River. The Constitutional Act 1791 divided the colony in two at the Ottawa River, so that the western part (Upper Canada) could be under the English legal system, with English speakers in the majority. The eastern part was named Lower Canada.

==Governors==
In 1760, following the capitulation of Montreal, the colony was placed under military government, with civil government only instituted beginning in 1764. The following were the governors:
* James Murray 1760–1766
* Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester 1766–1778
* Sir Frederick Haldimand 1778–1786
* Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester 1786–1796

There were also &quot;lieutenant governors&quot;, but these were merely the deputies of the governors, and should not be confused with the subsequent to 1791 Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec.

* Guy Carleton (lieutenant governor to James Murray) 1766–1768
* Hector Theophilus de Cramahé (lieutenant governor to Guy Carleton) 1771–1782
* Henry Hamilton (lieutenant governor to Frederick Haldimand) 1782–1785
* Henry Hope (lieutenant governor to the Lord Dorchester) 1785–1788
* Alured Clarke (lieutenant governor to the Lord Dorchester) 1790

==Counsellors to the governor==

The Province of Quebec did not have an elected legislature and was ruled directly by the governor with advice from counsellors. A council responsible to advise the governor (then James Murray) on all affairs of state was created in 1764. The Quebec Act 1774 created a &quot;Council for the Affairs of the Province of Quebec&quot; to advise the governor on legislative affairs. The Legislative Council served as an advisory council to the governor until a legislative assembly was established after 1791.

The individuals James Murray called into the council from 1764 to 1766:

==Geography==

Around 1763 to 1764, the province was divided into two judicial districts:

* Montreal District – covering the western parts of Quebec along the St. Lawrence River including Montreal and much of Ontario (Eastern and Southern Ontario)
* Quebec District – covering the eastern parts of Quebec along the St. Lawrence and Labrador

In 1790, the Trois-Rivières District was formed out of part of Quebec District.

The Trois-Rivières and Quebec districts continued after 1791 when Lower Canada came into existence, while Montreal District west of the Ottawa River became Upper Canada and east of the Ottawa River was partitioned into many electoral districts.

<text>Robert Alastair Addie (10 February 1960 – 20 November 2003) was an English film and theatre actor, who came to prominence playing the role of Sir Guy of Gisburne in the 1980s British television drama series &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;.

==Early life==
Addie was born in Stroud, Gloucestershire, the son of a stable owner, and was educated at Marlborough College. After initially being employed as a trainee estate agent on a ranch in Argentina, he returned to England and joined the National Youth Theatre in London in 1976 at the age of 16. Subsequently, he trained in acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, which he left after a year after successfully auditioning for the role of Mordred in the 1981 film &quot;Excalibur&quot;.

==Career==
Addie was a professional polo player; his skills as a horseman and also with sword and bow led to his frequently appearing in historical dramas set in the medieval era.

At the beginning of his career in the early 1980s he appeared on British television in a number of advertisements for products ranging from Polycell plastering repair wall filler to Mr Kipling cakes. In the early 1980s he also appeared in a variety of theatrical productions, including &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; in 1981 at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley, and &quot;Conduct Unbecoming&quot; in 1982 at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford.

His most prominent film role was Prince Mordred in John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981). Other films included &quot;Another Country&quot; (1984), as Delahay.

On television, Addie starred as &quot;Stalky&quot; in a 1982 BBC television mini-series of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Stalky &amp; Co.&quot;. In 1987, he played Sir Charles Kirkgordon in the CBS mini-series &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Manhattan&quot; and Lord Peter Gillingham in &quot;A Hazard of Hearts&quot;. His role as Sir Guy of Gisburne in the 1984–1986 English television series &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; brought his career national exposure.

In 1989, he abandoned acting and spent several years living in Spain and the United States. Returning to his career in 1995, he initially performed in touring fringe theatre original productions with the Chichester-based Exiled Theatre Company. In 1995 he appeared with the company in &quot;Shades in Time - Martyrs&quot;, involving a promenading performance within Gloucester Cathedral, and as the character of a mouse in the play &quot;Shades in Time - The Docks&quot; set at Gloucester Docks as a part of the 1995 Gloucester Festival. In late 1995, he performed with the company in Cheltenham in a theatrical monologue he wrote about a Mohammedan jihadist suicide bomber entitled &quot;Acts of Revenge&quot;, and in 1996 he appeared in the new plays by the company: &quot;Edmund, Son of Gloucester&quot; (a prequel to Shakespeare&#x27;s King Lear) and &quot;Into the Mist&quot; – a play set in early medieval Scotland with Addie playing St Columba.

After this Addie resumed a film and television career, also acting in a number of television commercials in 1998 for designer kitchens, whisky, and habit-breaking products for cigarettes.

==Personal life and death==
Addie was married three times and had three children; Alex, Alastair, and Caitlin. His marriages all ended in divorce. He died on 20 November 2003 at age 43 in Cheltenham General Hospital from the effects of lung cancer, less than three weeks after the disease was diagnosed. On the tenth anniversary of his death, fans planted a cherry tree bearing a commemorative plaque in his memory in the Jack Gardner Memorial Garden in Cirencester.

<text>Kosmos 60 ( meaning &quot;Cosmos 60&quot;) was an E-6 No.9 probe (Ye-6 series), launched by the Soviet Union. It was the sixth attempt at a lunar soft-landing mission, with a design similar to that of Luna 4.

Kosmos 60 was launched by a Molniya 8K78 rocket, serial number G15000-24, flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The launch took place at 09:25:31 GMT. The spacecraft achieved a low Earth orbit, with a perigee of , an apogee of , an inclination of 64.7°, and an orbital period of 89.1 minutes, but failed to leave orbit for its journey to the Moon due to a failure when the Blok L upper stage failed to fire for the trans-lunar injection burn. Instead, the spacecraft remained stranded in Earth orbit. A later investigation indicated that there might have been a short circuit in the electric converter within the control system of the spacecraft (which also controlled the Blok L stage) preventing engine ignition. It had an on-orbit mass of . The satellite reentered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on 17 March 1965.

Kosmos 60 carried two instruments: an imaging system and the SBM-10 radiation detector.

<text>Kosmos (, , meaning &quot;(outer) space&quot; or &quot;Kosmos&quot;) is a designation given to many satellites operated by the Soviet Union and subsequently Russia. Kosmos 1, the first spacecraft to be given a Kosmos designation, was launched on 16 March 1962.

== History ==
The first Soviet satellites orbiting Earth were named Sputnik, Polyot (starting in 1963), Elektron (in 1964), Proton (in 1965), and Molniya (in 1965), but most have been called Kosmos since Kosmos 1 on 16 March 1962. The program has included uncrewed tests of crewed spacecraft and satellites for scientific research and military purposes. , 2548 Kosmos satellites have been launched. The spacecraft do not form a single programme, but instead consist of almost all Soviet and Russian military satellites, as well as a number of scientific satellites, and spacecraft which failed during or immediately after launch, but still reached orbit.

Most Soviet and subsequently Russian military satellites were given Kosmos designations. Spacecraft include optical reconnaissance satellites, communications satellites, early warning missile defence spacecraft, nuclear-powered radar reconnaissance satellites, anti-satellite weapons and their targets, navigation satellites and technology demonstrators. Some scientific spacecraft such as Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik, Bion and Meteor satellites were also given Kosmos designations.

The designation is given only to satellites which are in Earth orbit. Typically, Soviet Lunar and planetary missions were initially put into a low Earth parking orbit along with an 
upper stage, which would later burn for around four minutes to place the spacecraft into a cislunar or a heliocentric orbit. If the engine misfired or the burn was not completed, the probes which would be left in Earth orbit would be given a Kosmos designation.

Control systems for 152 spacecraft which were later assigned Kosmos designations were developed and manufactured by NPO Electropribor (Kharkiv).

<text>Landsat 1 (LS-1), formerly named ERTS-A and ERTS-1, was the first satellite of the United States&#x27; Landsat program. It was a modified version of the Nimbus 4 meteorological satellite and was launched on July 23, 1972, by a Delta 900 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

It was the first satellite to carry a Multispectral Scanner.

The near-polar orbiting spacecraft served as a stabilized, Earth-oriented platform for obtaining information on agricultural and forestry resources, geology and mineral resources, hydrology and water resources, geography, cartography, environmental pollution, oceanography and marine resources, and meteorological phenomena.

==Background==

The multi-agency Earth Resources Satellites Program was begun in 1966 by the Department of the Interior. The goal of the program was to gather data from the Earth via remote sensing techniques. The following year a feasibility study was performed for the Earth Resources Technology Satellite. The Bureau of Budget (BOB) did not grant funding to build the satellite, but provided $2 million to continue the feasibility studies.

==Satellite design==
===Development===
Definition studies for two Earth observation satellites began in 1967. The satellites were named Earth Resources Technology Satellite and were individually known as ERTS-A and ERTS-B.

In 1970, General Electric was selected as the prime contractor for ERTS-A. It was manufactured by GE&#x27;s Space Division in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.

===Operation===
The spacecraft was tall with a diameter. Two solar panel arrays that were long each, with single axis articulation, generated power for the spacecraft. ERTS-A had a liftoff weight of .

The main spacecraft propulsion was three hydrazine thrusters. An attitude control system permitted the spacecraft&#x27;s orientation to be maintained within plus or minus 0.7 degrees in all three axes.

Spacecraft communications included a command subsystem operating at 154.2 and 2106.4 MHz and a PCM narrow-band telemetry subsystem, operating at 2287.5 and 137.86 MHz, for spacecraft housekeeping, attitude, and sensor performance data. Video data from the three-camera RBV system was transmitted in both real-time and tape recorder modes at 2265.5 MHz, while information from the MSS was constrained to a 20 MHz radio-frequency bandwidth at 2229.5 MHz.

The satellite also carried two wide-band video tape recorders (WBVTR) capable of storing up to 30 minutes of scanner or camera data, giving the spacecraft&#x27;s sensors a near-global coverage capability.

The satellite was also equipped with a data collection system (DCS) to collect information from remote, individually equipped ground stations and to relay the data to central acquisition stations. Due to the orbit of the satellite, data could be obtained at a minimum of every 12 hours. No data processing or signal multiplexing occurred on the satellite. The design of the DCS came from the Nimbus-3 platform, then known as the interrogation, recording, and location system (IRLS).

===Sensors===
ERTS-A had two sensors to achieve its primary objectives: the return beam vidicon (RBV) and the multispectral scanner (MSS).

The RBV was manufactured by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). The RBV obtained visible light and near infrared photographic images of Earth. At launch, the RBV was considered the primary sensor.

The MSS was designed by Virginia Norwood at Hughes Aircraft Company, which also manufactured it. Norwood is called &quot;The Mother of Landsat.&quot; The sensor was considered an experimental sensor, and was the secondary sensor, until scientists reviewed the data that was beamed back to Earth. After the data was reviewed, the MSS was considered the primary sensor. The MSS was a four-channel scanner that obtained radiometric images of Earth.

==Mission==
===Launch===
ERTS-A was launched July 23, 1972, on a Delta 0900 out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The spacecraft was placed in a sun-synchronous orbit, with an altitude between 907 and 915 km. The spacecraft was placed in an orbit with an inclination of 99 degrees which orbited the Earth every 103 minutes. It was the first satellite launched with the sole purpose of studying and monitoring the planet.

Upon reaching orbit, it was renamed to ERTS-1. On January 14, 1975, eight days before ERTS-B was to launch, NASA announced that ERTS-1 was renamed Landsat 1 and ERTS-B would be Landsat 2 after launch.

===Operations===
Landsat 1&#x27;s tape recorders malfunctioned in January 1978, and the satellite was taken out of service.

==Results==

From launch until 1974, Landsat 1 transmitted over 100,000 images, which covered more than 75% of the Earth&#x27;s surface. The majority of these images were taken with the multispectral scanner. On 5 August 1972 the return beam vidicon failed after taking only 1690 images.

In 1976, Landsat 1 discovered a tiny uninhabited island 20 kilometers off the eastern coast of Canada. This island was thereafter designated Landsat Island after the satellite.

The MSS provided more than 300,000 images over the lifespan of the satellite. NASA oversaw 300 researchers that evaluated the data that Landsat 1 transmitted back to Earth.

Landsat 1 images were used in the first study of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), now an ubiquitous measure of global plant greenness.

<text>In number theory, the Heegner theorem establishes the complete list of the quadratic imaginary number fields whose rings of integers are principal ideal domains. It solves a special case of Gauss&#x27;s class number problem of determining the number of imaginary quadratic fields that have a given fixed class number.

Let denote the set of rational numbers, and let be a square-free integer. The field is a quadratic extension of . The class number of is one if and only if the ring of integers of is a principal ideal domain. The Baker–Heegner–Stark theorem can then be stated as follows:

:If , then the class number of is one if and only if formula_1
These are known as the Heegner numbers.

By replacing with the discriminant of this list is often written as:
:formula_2

==History==
This result was first conjectured by Gauss in Section 303 of his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; (1798). It was essentially proven by Kurt Heegner in 1952, but Heegner&#x27;s proof was not accepted until an academic mathematician Harold Stark published a proof in 1967 which had many commonalities to Heegner&#x27;s work, though Stark considers the proofs to be different. Heegner &quot;died before anyone really understood what he had done&quot;. Stark formally paraphrases Heegner&#x27;s proof in 1969; other contemporary papers produced various similar proofs using modular functions.

Alan Baker&#x27;s slightly earlier 1966 proof used completely different principles which reduced the result to a finite amount of computation, with Stark&#x27;s 1963/4 thesis already providing this computation; he won the Fields Medal for his methods. Stark later pointed out that Baker&#x27;s proof, involving linear forms in 3 logarithms, could be reduced to a statement about only 2 logarithms which was already known from 1949 by Gelfond and Linnik.

Stark&#x27;s 1969 paper also cited the 1895 text by Heinrich Martin Weber and noted that if Weber had &quot;only made the observation that the reducibility of [a certain equation] would lead to a Diophantine equation, the class-number one problem would have been solved 60 years ago&quot;. Bryan Birch notes that Weber&#x27;s book, and essentially the whole field of modular functions, dropped out of interest for half a century: &quot;Unhappily, in 1952 there was no one left who was sufficiently expert in Weber&#x27;s &quot;Algebra&quot; to appreciate Heegner&#x27;s achievement.&quot;

Deuring, Siegel, and Chowla all gave slightly variant proofs by modular functions in the immediate years after Stark. Other versions in this genre have also cropped up over the years. For instance, in 1985, Monsur Kenku gave a proof using the Klein quartic (though again utilizing modular functions). And again, in 1999, Imin Chen gave another variant proof by modular functions (following Siegel&#x27;s outline).

The work of Gross and Zagier (1986) combined with that of Goldfeld (1976) also gives an alternative proof.

==Real case==
On the other hand, it is unknown whether there are infinitely many &quot;d&quot; &gt; 0 for which Q() has class number 1. Computational results indicate that there are many such fields. Number Fields with class number one provides a list of some of these.

<text>Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water is a 1986 American history book by Marc Reisner about land development and water policy in the western United States. The book largely focuses on the history of two federal agencies, the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and their struggles to remake the American West in ways to satisfy national settlement and energy generation goals. The book concludes that the development-driven policies, formed when settling the West was the country&#x27;s main concern, have had serious long-term negative effects on the environment and water quantity. 

The book was revised and updated in 1993, with a new Afterword by the author. The book was again reissued in 2017, with a lengthy Postscript by Lawrie Mott, a former staff scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

== Reception ==
In a review written shortly after publication, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the book as &quot;a revealing, absorbing, often amusing and alarming report on where billions of their dollars have gone – and where a lot more are going.&quot; In 1986, &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot; was a finalist for both the National Book Critics&#x27; Circle Award and the Bay Area Book Reviewers&#x27; Award (BABRA).

In 1999, a Modern Library panel of authors and critics ranked it 61st on a list of the 100 most notable English-language works of nonfiction of the 20th century. 

The Property and Environment Research Center reviewed the book 25 years after first publication, calling it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and saying that it is &quot;compelling today as it was on publication in 1986&quot;. It praised the research that went into work, calling out the interviews performed by Reisner to produce the book. &quot;Summit Daily News&quot; has also praised Reisner&#x27;s research and called out Reisner&#x27;s framing of the Bureau of Reclamation as the &quot;clear villain&quot; and the Colorado River as its &quot;most abused victim&quot;, ultimately calling the book &quot;prophetic.&quot;

== Adaptations and representations in other media ==
A portion of the 1993 update was printed in the 1994 inaugural edition of the &quot;Hastings West-Northwest Journal of Environmental Law and Policy&quot;.

A four-part television documentary based on the revised book was produced in 1996 by KTEH, the PBS affiliate in San Jose, California.

This book has been referred to in 21st-century fiction about the effects of climate change (so-called climate fiction), such as Paolo Bacigalupi&#x27;s &quot;The Water Knife&quot; (2015), a thriller set in the near-future. Several characters refer to &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot; as having anticipated the environmental decline they are living through. The physical book also plays an important role. Claire Vaye Watkins refers to &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot; as a source in her acknowledgments for her novel, &quot;Gold Fame Citrus&quot; (2015).

<doc id="391255" wikidata="Q433939" url="?curid=391255" title="René Jacobs">
<text>René Jacobs (born 30 October 1946) is a Belgian musician. He came to fame as a countertenor, but later in his career he became known as a conductor of baroque and classical opera.

==Biography==
===Countertenor===
Born in Ghent, Jacobs began his musical career as a boy chorister at the Cathedral. Later he studied classical philology at the University of Ghent while continuing to sing in Brussels and in The Hague.

The Kuijken brothers, Gustav Leonhardt and Alfred Deller all encouraged him to pursue a career as a countertenor, and he quickly became known as one of the best of his time. He recorded a large amount of less-known Baroque music by such composers as Antonio Cesti, d&#x27;India, Ferrari, Marenzio, Lambert, Guédron, William Lawes and others. He also sang in much-acclaimed recordings of the major works of Bach (such as the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; led by Gustav Leonhardt and Philippe Herreweghe).

===Conductor===
In 1977, he founded the ensemble Concerto Vocale.

As a conductor, Jacobs recorded numerous operas and sacred and secular works of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. His recording of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; is especially renowned, having won such awards as &quot;Gramophone&quot;″s Record of the Year for 2004, &quot;Le Monde de la musique&quot;″s &quot;Choc&quot; of the Year for 2004, a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Opera recording of 2005&quot;, and two Midem Classical Awards in 2004. Other award-winning recordings include George Frideric Handel&#x27;s &quot;Rinaldo&quot; (Cannes Classical Award, 2004), and Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot; (&quot;Diapason d’Or&quot; of 2005). The partial discography below lists some of the many other awards won by Jacobs&#x27; recordings.

His recordings and work have won numerous awards, including the Grammy Award for &quot;Best Opera&quot;, &quot;Gramophone&quot;″s &quot;Record of the Year&quot;, the &quot;III Premio Traetta 2011&quot;, and numerous European awards. His recording of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; was Record of the Year at the inaugural International Classical Music Awards in April 2011.

He is particularly noted as a singer&#x27;s conductor, and for his handling of recitative.

<text>The IBM Information Management System (IMS) is a joint hierarchical database and information management system that supports transaction processing. Development began in 1966 to keep track of the bill of materials for the Saturn V rocket of the Apollo program, and the first version on the IBM System/360 Model 65 was completed in 1967 as ICS/DL/I and officially installed in August 1968.

IBM rebranded it IMS/360 in 1969, and ported it to new platforms as they emerged. In 1988, the company claimed that there were 7,000 IMS sites active worldwide. and went on to see extensive use and continual improvement to this day. IMS&#x27;s most successful year in terms of sales was in 2003, 35 years after it was released. It was in use by over 95% of the Fortune 1000.

== History ==
===DATE and DL/1===
IMS ultimately traces its history to a 1963 contract from NASA to help control the continual list of changes being made to the Apollo command and service module at the North American Rockwell (NAR) plants in Downey, California (Los Angeles area). IBM sent Uri Berman to build an application to track the latest change number for any given part on NAR&#x27;s IBM 7010 mainframe computer.

Working with Rockwell&#x27;s Pete Nordyke, they developed a system based on the recently introduced hard disk which could be queried by NAR&#x27;s network of computer terminals spread through the engineering department. The database stored the parts number and their latest revisions, which ensured that any changes being made by the engineers were being applied to the latest version of any related parts, which they could find by looking up the relationships between the parts in the database.

The resulting system, known as DATE for &quot;Disk Applications in a Teleprocessing Environment&quot;, was flexible due to Berman&#x27;s decision to separate the portions of the system responsible for the physical storage on disk with the portions that handled user interaction. The user interaction side was realized to be a separate concept and began to be known as DL/1, for &quot;Data Language/One&quot;. The system was installed on the 7010 in 1965.

===ICS===
By the time DATE was running, the 7010 was obsolete and the entire 7000 series was replaced by the System/360 family. NAR selected the IBM System/360 Model 65 as their replacement for the 7010. As part of a port to the 360, IBM proposed an extended version of the DATE concept that could further develop the storage side of the system to allow the data format to be defined separately from the DL/1 side that would query it. This would allow the same system to be used for any sort of data by changing what would today be known as the data definition. Rockwell management was skeptical, but the technical manager, Robert Brown, was a former IBM employee and eventually came to support the concept based on the promise that it would allow it to be more easily ported.

The first formal definition was written in 1966. The team was expanded with twelve people from IBM, ten from NAR, and three from Caterpillar Tractor who also planned to use the system. The new system was known as ICS/DL/I, for &quot;Information Control System and Data Language/Interface&quot; The first version was completed in 1967, and officially installed at NAR on 14 August 1968 when the first &quot;READY&quot; message appeared on an NAR IBM 2740 terminal.

===IMS===
The next year, IBM put the product on the market after rebranding it IMS/360. It has been developed and expanded continually since then, as IBM System/360 technology evolved into the current z/OS and IBM zEnterprise System technologies. In 1988, as part of its 20th year of use, IBM announced that IMS was in use at 7,000 locations. In &quot;From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, Martin Campbell-Kelly put the number at 30,000 at the end of 1989.

Vern Watts had worked continuously on IMS since the 1960&#x27;s and was IMS&#x27;s chief architect for many years. Watts joined IBM in 1956 and worked at IBM&#x27;s Silicon Valley development labs until his death on April 4, 2009. For his work as the &quot;father of DL/1&quot;, Berman received an IBM Outstanding Contribution Award and its associated $100,000.

==Database==
IBM Information Management System (IMS) utilizes a hierarchical database model, distinct from IBM&#x27;s later relational database model as seen in IBM Db2. In IMS, data is organized into segments (known today as records or structs), each comprising multiple fields, structured hierarchically to manage complex relationships effectively. For instance, in a customer database, a root segment at the top of the hierarchy may include fields such as phone number, name, and age. Child segments can be added beneath, such as order segments under each customer segment, representing orders placed by customers, with further child segments for individual items on each order.

==Types of IMS Hierarchical Databases==

*Full Function Databases*
- Originating from the Data Language Interface (DL/I) databases developed for Apollo, full function databases support primary and secondary indexes, accessed via DL/I calls similar to SQL calls in IBM Db2 or Oracle.
- These databases can be accessed through various methods, with Hierarchical Direct (HDAM) and Hierarchical Indexed Direct (HIDAM) being prominent. Other formats include Simple Hierarchical Indexed Sequential (SHISAM), Hierarchical Sequential (HSAM), and Hierarchical Indexed Sequential (HISAM).
- Data in full-function databases is stored using VSAM, a native z/OS access method, or OSAM, an IMS-specific method optimizing I/O for IMS access patterns, particularly benefiting from sequential access (OSAM Sequential Buffering).

*Fast Path Databases*
- Optimized for high transaction rates, Fast Path databases include Data Entry Databases (DEDBs) and Main Storage Databases (MSDBs).
- DEDBs employ direct (randomizer) access similar to HDAM in full-function databases, offering enhanced performance through high-performance access methods and asynchronous write after commit. They leverage a Unit of Work (UOW) concept for simplified online reorganization utilities starting from IMS Version 11.

*High Availability Large Databases (HALDBs)*
- Introduced in IMS V7, HALDBs extend the capabilities of full function databases to enhance availability and handle large data volumes effectively.
- IMS V9 introduced online reorganization for HALDBs, supporting continuous availability and accommodating data volumes exceeding 40 terabytes.

== Transaction Manager ==
IMS is a transaction manager, (IMS TM, also known as IMS DC) which interacts with an end user connected through VTAM or TCP/IP, (including 3270 and Web user interfaces) or another application. It can process a business function (such as a banking account withdrawal), and maintain state throughout the process, making sure that the system records the business function correctly to a data store. 

IMS TM uses a messaging and queuing paradigm. An IMS control program receives a transaction entered from a terminal (or Web browser or other application) and then stores the transaction on a message queue (in memory or in a dataset). IMS then invokes its scheduler on the queued transaction to start the business application program in a message processing region. The message processing region retrieves the transaction from the IMS message queue and processes it, reading and updating IMS and/or Db2 databases and ensuring proper recording of the transaction. Then, if required, IMS enqueues a response message back onto the IMS message queue. Once the output message is complete and available, the IMS control program sends it back to the originating terminal. IMS TM can handle this whole process thousands (or even tens of thousands) of times per second. In 2013, IBM completed a benchmark on IMS Version 13 demonstrating the ability to process 100,000 transactions per second on a single IMS system.

== Application ==
IMS TM provides a standard environment for transaction execution. Several Chinese banks had purchased IMS by the late 2000s to support the country&#x27;s burgeoning financial industry.

IMS complements IBM Db2, IBM&#x27;s relational database system introduced in 1982. IMS generally performs faster than Db2 for common tasks, but may require more programming effort to design and maintain for non-primary duties. 

A relational data warehouse may be used to supplement an IMS database. For example, IMS may provide primary ATM transactions because it performs well for such a specific task.
