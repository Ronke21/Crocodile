<text>Strother Douglas Martin Jr. (March 26, 1919 – August 1, 1980) was an American character actor who often appeared in support of John Wayne and Paul Newman and in Western films directed by John Ford and Sam Peckinpah.

Among Martin&#x27;s memorable performances is his portrayal of the warden or &quot;captain&quot; of a state prison camp in the 1967 film &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;, in which he utters the line, &quot;What we&#x27;ve got here is failure to communicate.&quot; The line is number 11 on the American Film Institute list of &quot;100 Years...100 Movie Quotes&quot;.

==Early life==
Martin was born March 26, 1919, in Kokomo, Indiana to Ethel (née Dunlap) and Strother Douglas Martin. For a short time, the Martins lived in San Antonio, Texas, but soon returned to Indiana. As a child, he excelled at swimming and diving. He was nicknamed &quot;T-Bone Martin&quot; because of his diving expertise. At 17 he won the National Junior Springboard Diving Championship. He served as a swimming instructor in the United States Navy during World War II and was a member of the diving team at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He entered the adult National Springboard Diving competition in hopes of gaining a berth on the U.S. Olympic team, but finished third in the competition.

==Acting career==
After the war, Martin moved to Los Angeles and worked as a swimming instructor and as a swimming extra in water scenes in films, including the 1950 crime drama &quot;The Damned Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. He earned bit roles in a number of pictures and soon gained frequent character roles in films and television through the 1950s, having appeared in such programs as the Western anthology series &quot;Frontier&quot; on NBC and the syndicated American Civil War drama &quot;Gray Ghost&quot;. He was cast in 1955 as Landry Kersh in the episode &quot;Shadow of God&quot; on the ABC religion anthology series &quot;Crossroads&quot;. Martin also portrays a man with learning difficulties in &quot;Cooter&quot;, an episode written by Sam Peckinpah in 1956 for the second season of the long-running Western series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. He had many various, and prominent, roles throughout the entire series. The next year on that series he played the character &quot;Dillard&quot; in &quot;The Constable&quot;.

Martin appeared in the first Brian Keith series, &quot;Crusader&quot;, a Cold War drama on CBS. He guest-starred, as a circus tightrope walker Dooley Delaware, in the 1957 episode &quot;High Wire&quot; in CBS&#x27; &quot;Have Gun - Will Travel&quot;. He portrayed a henpecked soldier in a 1958 episode of the syndicated Western series, &quot;Boots and Saddles&quot; and starred in a &quot;Trackdown&quot; episode &quot;A Stone for Benny French&quot;. That same year, he played the lead in the episode &quot;Pete Henke&quot; of NBC&#x27;s Western &quot;Jefferson Drum&quot;.

In 1959, Martin played Polk, with Denver Pyle as Houston, in the episode &quot;No Place to Stop&quot; of the CBS Western series, &quot;The Texan&quot;, starring Rory Calhoun as Bill Longley. In another 1959 Western series, Martin was cast as Deputy Jess in the episode &quot;Johnny Yuma&quot; of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Rebel&quot;, starring Nick Adams. He played land surveyor Meeker in &quot;Rawhide&quot; S2 E8 &quot;Incident of the Haunted Hills&quot; which aired 11/5/1959. Also in 1959 on the Western TV series Lawman, Season 2 E8, he played Jack Foley. In 1960, Martin guest-starred in James Whitmore&#x27;s ABC crime drama, &quot;The Law and Mr. Jones&quot;.

In 1961, Martin portrayed Pete Gibson in the episode &quot;The Case of the Brazen Bequest&quot; on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;. In 1962, he was cast as Harold Horton in &quot;The Chocolate Cake Caper&quot; of the CBS sitcom, &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;, starring Harry Morgan and Cara Williams. He guest-starred in Jack Lord&#x27;s ABC adventure/drama series, &quot;Stoney Burke&quot;. In 1963, he was cast as Private Anton Copang in the episode &quot;Walk Through the Badlands&quot; of the ABC/Warner Brothers Western series, &quot;The Dakotas&quot;. In 1966, Martin appeared twice as &quot;Cousin Fletch&quot; in the short-lived ABC comedy Western &quot;The Rounders&quot;, with Ron Hayes, Patrick Wayne, and Chill Wills.

In 1967, Martin played Arizona miner Ed Schieffelin in the episode &quot;Silver Tombstone&quot; of the syndicated television series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;. Martin played villainous roles in many of the best-known Westerns of the 1950s and 1960s, including &quot;The Horse Soldiers&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot;. He played an Indian agent in the John Wayne film, &quot;McLintock!&quot; (1963) and a horse trader in the 1969 film, &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969).

By the late 1960s, Martin was almost as well-known a figure as many top-billed stars. In 1967, the same year as his role in &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;, he appeared in the episode &quot;A Mighty Hunter Before the Lord&quot; of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Road West&quot; series starring Barry Sullivan. In 1972, he appeared as James Garner&#x27;s uncle in the &quot;Zacharia&quot; episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Nichols&quot;. He also had a pronounced physical and vocal resemblance to playwright Tennessee Williams and occasionally parodied him, notably in the &quot;Baby Fat&quot; episode of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;.

The play &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; was revived on March 17, 1972, at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles with Martin, Henry Fonda, Richard Dreyfuss, Gloria Grahame, Lewis J. Stadlen, Ron Thompson, Jane Alexander, Richard X. Slattery, and Pepper Martin among the cast with Edwin Sherin directing.

Martin appeared in all three of the classic Westerns released in 1969: Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (as Coffer, a bloodthirsty bounty hunter), George Roy Hill&#x27;s &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (as Percy Garris, the &quot;colorful&quot; Bolivian mine boss who hires the two title characters), and Henry Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;True Grit&quot; (as Colonel Stonehill, a horse dealer). He frequently acted alongside L.Q. Jones, who in real life was one of his closest friends.

Though he usually appeared in supporting roles, he had major parts in &quot;Hannie Caulder&quot; (1971), &quot;The Brotherhood of Satan&quot; (1971), &quot;Pocket Money&quot; (1972) with Paul Newman and Lee Marvin, and in the horror film &quot;SSSSSSS&quot; (1973). Martin later appeared in another George Roy Hill film, &quot;Slap Shot&quot; (1977), again with Paul Newman, as the cheap general manager of the Charlestown Chiefs hockey club. He appeared six times each with John Wayne and Paul Newman. In an interview originally published in &quot;Movietone News&quot; in 1981, Martin commented on his professional relationship with both Wayne and Newman:

Martin can also be seen in Cheech and Chong&#x27;s &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; (1978) as Arnold Stoner, the father of Tommy Chong&#x27;s character Anthony.

Martin made many guest appearances on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; including the two-part episode &quot;Island in the Desert&quot;, in which he portrayed a crazy desert hermit named Ben Snow. Previously, he guest-starred as Marv Rowley in the 1961 &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; episode &quot;Tall Trapper&quot; playing an angry man who murders his wife out of jealousy then tries to pin the killing on a quiet, respectful trapper who his wife fell for.

He also made many guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; throughout the nine-year run from 1957 to 1966, including a horseman in the 1962 episode &quot;The Case of the Fickle Filly&quot;, a college employee in &quot;The Case of the Brazen Bequest&quot;, and as Gerald Sommers in &quot;The Case of the Drowsy Mosquito&quot;. In 1963, he appeared in Glynis Johns&#x27; short-lived comedy series &quot;Glynis&quot; in the episode &quot;Ten Cents a Dance&quot;. In 1965, Martin appeared in the episode &quot;Most Precious Gold&quot; of the NBC comedy/drama series &quot;Kentucky Jones&quot;, starring Dennis Weaver. In 1965, he guest-starred as Meeker in the episode &quot;Return to Lawrence&quot; on the ABC Western &quot;The Legend of Jesse James&quot;. In 1966, he guest-starred in the &quot;Lost In Space&quot; episode &quot;Blast Off Into Space&quot; as a gritty mining engineer named Nerim. On a &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; episode, Martin played a man living supposedly alone on the island for a radio show contest. In 1973–1974, he was a regular cast member of the James Stewart legal drama and murder mystery series &quot;Hawkins&quot;. He also starred in a two-part &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; 1977 episode as T.T. Flowers &quot;The Trees, the Bees and T. T. Flowers&quot;, an episode that took on urban invasion and the environment.

One of his last acting jobs was as host of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on April 19, 1980. In one of the skits, Martin played the strict owner of a French language camp for children, based on his role as the prison captain from &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;. He even paraphrased his most famous line from the film, &quot;What we have here is failure to communicate BILINGUALLY!&quot; In another, he played a terminally ill man who videotaped his last will and testament. During his monologue, he again did his Tennessee Williams impression. That episode was supposed to be rerun during the summer of 1980, but it was pulled and replaced with another episode due to Martin&#x27;s death.

==Death==
Martin was married to Helen Meisels-Martin from 1967 until his death; they had no children. In the last few years of his life, Martin was under a doctor&#x27;s care for diabetes and cardiac problems. After attending a dinner at a Beverly Hills hotel, he awoke early the next morning (August 1, 1980) at his home in Agoura, California with chest pains and died of a heart attack aged 61, at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, California.

<doc id="383267" wikidata="Q6835335" url="?curid=383267" title="Michael Wilbon">
<text>Michael Wilbon ( ; born November 19, 1958) is an American commentator for ESPN and former sportswriter and columnist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. He is an analyst for ESPN and has co-hosted &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; on ESPN since 2001.

==Early life and education==
Wilbon was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from St. Ignatius College Preparatory School in 1976 and received his journalism degree in 1980 from Northwestern University&#x27;s Medill School of Journalism. While in college, Wilbon wrote for &quot;The Daily Northwestern&quot;.

==Career==
=== Newspapers ===
Wilbon began working for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1980 after summer internships at the newspaper in 1979 and 1980. He covered college sports, Major League Baseball, the National Football League and the National Basketball Association before being promoted to full-time columnist in 1990. His column in the &quot;Post&quot;, which dealt as much with the culture of sports as the action on the court or field, appeared up to four times a week until he left to work full-time for ESPN on December 7, 2010.

In his career, Wilbon covered ten Summer and Winter Olympic Games for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, every Super Bowl since 1987, nearly every Final Four since 1982 and each year&#x27;s NBA Finals since . Notably, he was also the only reporter based outside of Hawaii to cover the historic basketball upset of top-ranked Virginia by then-NAIA member Chaminade in 1982 (he was in Honolulu to cover a college football bowl game).

During his time at the &quot;Post&quot;, Wilbon earned the reputation as one of &quot;the best deadline writer[s] in American newspapers.&quot; In 2001, Wilbon was named the top sports columnist by the Society of Professional Journalists.

In recent years, Wilbon has become more known as an ESPN personality than as a reporter. On December 7, 2010, he wrote his last column for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and officially dedicated full-time to work for ESPN and ABC.

=== Television ===
After contributing to ESPN&#x27;s &quot;The Sports Reporters&quot; and other shows on the cable network, Wilbon began co-hosting ESPN&#x27;s daily opinion forum &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; (&quot;PTI&quot;) with Tony Kornheiser on October 22, 2001. Wilbon was also a member of ABC&#x27;s &quot;NBA Countdown&quot; (which he hosted with Jalen Rose, Bill Simmons and Magic Johnson), which was the pre-game show for the network&#x27;s NBA telecasts. Prior to joining ESPN, Wilbon worked on the BET Budweiser Sports Report show. One memorable segment had Wilbon taking issue with Brian Williams (née Bison Dele) transferring from Maryland to Arizona.

In addition to his work at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;PTI&quot; and ESPN, Wilbon appeared weekly on WRC-TV in Washington, D.C., with WRC Sports Director George Michael, and Pro Football Hall of Famers John Riggins and Sonny Jurgensen on &quot;Redskins Report&quot; during the football season. He also appeared with Michael, &quot;USA Today&quot; basketball writer David Dupree and Tony Kornheiser on &quot;Full Court Press&quot; during the basketball season. Both of these shows were canceled in December 2008 due to budget cuts. Wilbon also forged a close friendship with former Marshall and former NFL quarterback Byron Leftwich while the young passer was a standout player for HD Woodson in Washington, D.C.

In late 2006, Wilbon agreed to a multi-year contract extension with ESPN. After accepting the contract, Wilbon offered to resign from the &quot;Post&quot;, but the newspaper&#x27;s chairman Don Graham and executive editor Len Downie both asked him to stay on. The network gained priority therein with regards to conflicts with his newspaper assignments. The first major conflict occurred on February 4, 2007, when Wilbon covered a Detroit Pistons–Cleveland Cavaliers game instead of Super Bowl XLI.

==Personal life==
Wilbon currently lives in Bethesda, Maryland, and also has a home in Scottsdale, Arizona. Wilbon and his wife Cheryl Johnson Wilbon had their first child, Matthew Raymond Wilbon, via surrogate on March 26, 2008. Kornheiser often refers to Matthew affectionately as &quot;Lilbon.&quot;

Wilbon has a cousin, Travon Bellamy, who played for the University of Illinois football team. Former ABC News reporter Carole Simpson is Wilbon&#x27;s cousin.

Wilbon suffered a heart attack on January 27, 2008. After complaining of chest pains, he was taken to a Scottsdale hospital where doctors performed an angioplasty. Wilbon is also a type-2 diabetic.

On August 10, 2008, during a Cubs–Cardinals game at Wrigley Field, Wilbon threw out the ceremonial first pitch and then sang &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot; as part of the seventh-inning stretch. Footage of Wilbon wearing a tucked-in Cubs jersey and bouncing the pitch is frequently shown on &quot;Pardon The Interruption&quot; as a friendly teasing by Kornheiser.

In May 2009, Wilbon competed in a made-for-TV &quot;King of Bowling&quot; show against pro bowling star Wes Malott. Wilbon beat Malott by a score of 256–248, but Wilbon received a 57-pin handicap and Malott had to use a plastic ball.

Wilbon has served as a trustee of Northwestern University.

==White House visit==

On July 12, 2013, Wilbon, Kornheiser and Tony Reali (PTI statistician and de facto co-host) were guests at the White House. After lunch the trio met in the Oval Office with President Barack Obama.

<text>The Mount Allison Mounties are the varsity athletic teams that represent Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick, Canada.

The Mounties sports teams play their matches at Alumni Field which seats 2,500.

==Athletics and recreations==
The Mount Allison University Athletics &amp; Recreation is led by Pierre Arsenault. Arsenault came to Mount Allison from the New Brunswick Golf Association, where he served as executive director for seven years. Prior to this, Arsenault worked with Hockey Canada&#x27;s Atlantic Centre of Excellence, the Saskatchewan Hockey Association, and with the University of Ottawa&#x27;s Gee-Gees Varsity Hockey Team. He holds a Bachelor of Physical Education (concentration in sports administration) from the University of New Brunswick and a master&#x27;s degree in sport administration from the University of Ottawa.

==Varsity teams==
Mount Allison Mounties teams compete in:
* Badminton (m/w)
* Basketball (m/w)
* Football (m)
* Ice Hockey (w)
* Soccer (m/w)
* Swimming (m/w)

==Club teams==
The Mount Allison Mounties also field club teams in:
* Curling (w)
* Cross country (mixed)
* Dance (mixed)
* Field Hockey (w)
* Field Lacrosse (m)
* Ringette (w)
* Rugby (m/w)
* Ultimate frisbee (mixed)

==Logo==
In 1977, Garney Henley, a former Canadian Football League player with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, became Athletics Director at Mount Allison and changed the logo from the &quot;Double-Winged&quot; A to the famous &quot;Flying A&quot; which remained the Mounties&#x27; logo until 2011. The Flying A became synonymous with Mounties athletics, and was arguably the most recognizable aspect of the department and the university.

In 2011, the university&#x27;s administration undertook a re-branding initiative that would be campus-wide, stretching into the athletics department as well. Adopting a new, more modern look became the goal, and thus the current logo with an &quot;A&quot; adorned with a flame/torch was born. Taken from the university&#x27;s crest, the flame, which also forms a stylized &quot;A&quot;, along with the slanted font spelling &quot;MOUNTIES&quot; below the logo became the new look for the Mounties. Along with a new partnership with popular brand UnderArmour, it introduced the Mounties to the 21st century, and spearheaded by Athletics Director Pierre Arsenault became the one identity among all of the Mounties&#x27; varsity sports teams.

During the 2012 AUS Women&#x27;s Hockey Playoffs, a new movement emerged on the Social Media website Twitter, when it is believed the phrase #MountiePride was first used in a popular fashion. Since then, the movement has leaped to new heights, and is now considered to be a part of this new identity, and a trademark of the Mounties teams.

==Mounties football==
The Mounties football program has been in operation since 1955. The team has made two appearances in the Vanier Cup, first in 1984, and then in 1991. The team has won six Jewett Trophy conference championships in their 14 appearances, most recently during the team&#x27;s undefeated 2014 season. The program has also featured a Hec Crighton Trophy winner, Éric Lapointe, who won the award twice and was elected into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame based on his university career with the Mounties.

<doc id="383270" wikidata="Q669219" url="?curid=383270" title="Sweatt v. Painter">
<text>Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950), was a U.S. Supreme Court case that successfully challenged the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine of racial segregation established by the 1896 case &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;. The case was influential in the landmark case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; four years later.

The case involved a black man, Heman Marion Sweatt, who was refused admission to the School of Law of the University of Texas, whose president was Theophilus Painter, on the grounds that the Texas State Constitution prohibited integrated education. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of law student Sweatt, reasoning that the state&#x27;s racially separate law school was in fact unequal. Nonetheless, the Court limited its ruling in finding that it was not [yet] necessary to &quot;reach [Sweatt]&#x27;s contention that &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; should be reexamined in the light of contemporary knowledge respecting the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment and the effects of racial segregation.&quot; The decision was delivered on the same day as another case involving similar issues, &quot;McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents,&quot; also decided in favor of integrated graduate education.

==Procedural history==
The state district court in Travis County, Texas, instead of granting the plaintiff a writ of &quot;mandamus&quot;, continued the case for six months. This allowed the state time to create a law school only for black students, which it established in Houston, rather than in Austin. The &#x27;separate&#x27; law school and the college became the Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University (known then as &quot;Texas State University for Negroes&quot;).

The Dean of the Law School at the time was Charles T. McCormick. He wanted a separate law school for black students.

Texas Attorney General at the time was Price Daniel who advocated fiercely for racial segregation.

The trial court decision was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals and the Texas Supreme Court denied &quot;writ of error&quot; on further appeal. Sweatt and the NAACP next went to the federal courts, and the case ultimately reached the U.S. Supreme Court. Robert L. Carter and Thurgood Marshall presented Sweatt&#x27;s case.

==U.S. Supreme Court==
The Supreme Court reversed the lower court decision, saying that the separate school failed to qualify, both because of quantitative differences in facilities and experiential factors, such as its isolation from most of the future lawyers with whom its graduates would interact. The court held that, when considering graduate education, experience must be considered as part of &quot;substantive equality.&quot; The court&#x27;s decision documented the differences between white and black facilities:
* The University of Texas Law School had 16 full-time and 3 part-time professors, while the black law school had 5 full-time professors.
* The University of Texas Law School had 850 students and a law library of 65,000 volumes, while the black law school had 23 students and a library of 16,500 volumes.
* The University of Texas Law School had moot court facilities, an Order of the Coif affiliation, and numerous graduates involved in public and private law practice, while the black law school had only one practice court facility and only one graduate admitted to the Texas Bar.

==Legacy==
On June 14, 2005, the Travis County Commissioners voted to rename the courthouse as The Heman Marion Sweatt Travis County Courthouse in honor of Sweatt&#x27;s endeavor and victory.

<text>David J. Remnick (born October 29, 1958) is an American journalist, propagandist, writer, and editor. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994 for his book &quot;Lenin&#x27;s Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire&quot;, and is also the author of &quot;Resurrection&quot; and &quot;King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero&quot;. Remnick has been editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine since 1998. He was named &quot;Editor of the Year&quot; by &quot;Advertising Age&quot; in 2000. Before joining &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Remnick was a reporter and the Moscow correspondent for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. He also has served on the New York Public Library board of trustees and is a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 2010, he published his sixth book, &quot;The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama&quot;.

==Background==
Remnick was born to a Jewish family in Hackensack, New Jersey, the son of Barbara (Seigel), an art teacher, and Edward C. Remnick, a dentist. He was raised in Hillsdale, New Jersey, in a Jewish home with, he has said, &quot;a lot of books around.&quot; He attended Yavneh Academy in Paramus. Remnick was also a childhood friend of comedian Bill Maher. He attended Pascack Valley High School in Hillsdale. At Pascack Valley High School he studied Russian and was thereby inspired to also study the politics and culture of the USSR.

He was graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1981 with an A.B. in comparative literature; there he met writer John McPhee, was a member of the University Press Club, and helped found &quot;The Nassau Weekly&quot;. Remnick completed a 122-page-long senior thesis titled &quot;The Sympathetic Thread: &#x27;Leaves of Grass&#x27; 1855-1865.&quot; Remnick has implied that after college he wanted to write novels, but due to the illnesses of his parents, he needed to get a job. Wanting to be a writer, he took a job at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

==Career==

===&quot;The Washington Post&quot;===

Remnick began his reporting career at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1982 shortly after his graduation from Princeton. His first assignment was to cover the United States Football League. After six years, in 1988 he became the newspaper&#x27;s Moscow correspondent, which provided him with the material for &quot;Lenin&#x27;s Tomb&quot;. He also received the George Polk Award for excellence in journalism in 1993.

===&quot;The New Yorker&quot;===

Remnick became a staff writer at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in September 1992, after ten years at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

Remnick&#x27;s 1997 &quot;New Yorker&quot; article &quot;Kid Dynamite Blows Up&quot;, about boxer Mike Tyson, was nominated for a National Magazine Award. In July 1998, he became editor, succeeding Tina Brown. Remnick promoted Hendrik Hertzberg, a former Jimmy Carter speechwriter and former editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, to write the lead pieces in &quot;Talk of the Town&quot;, the magazine&#x27;s opening section. In 2005, Remnick earned $1 million for his work as the magazine&#x27;s editor.

In 2003, Remnick penned an editorial in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in the lead-up to the Iraq War saying &quot;the United States has been wrong, politically and morally, about Iraq more than once in the past... but... a return to a hollow pursuit of containment will be the most dangerous option of all.&quot; In the months leading up to the war, the magazine also published several articles connecting Saddam Hussein to al-Qaida, often relying on unnamed sources, or simply the claims of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, as evidence. The magazine received some criticism for their journalism during this period. The claims that Hussein and al-Qaida had a close operational relationship were false, as confirmed by numerous sources including a U.S military study in 2008.

In 2004, for the first time in its 80-year history, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; endorsed a presidential candidate, John Kerry.

In May 2009, Remnick was the subject of an extended Twitter thread by former &quot;New Yorker&quot; staff writer Dan Baum, whose contract with the magazine was not renewed by Remnick. The tweets, written over the course of a week, described the difficult relationship between Baum and Remnick, his editor.

Remnick&#x27;s biography of President Barack Obama, &quot;The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama&quot;, was released on April 6, 2010. It features hundreds of interviews with friends, colleagues, and other witnesses to Obama&#x27;s rise to the presidency of the United States.

In 2010, Remnick lent his support to the campaign urging the release of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, the Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning after being convicted of adultery and ordering the murder of her husband by her lover.

Remnick provided guest commentary and contributed to NBC coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, including the opening ceremony and commentary for NBC News.

Remnick is also the host of &quot;The New Yorker Radio Hour&quot;, produced by WNYC and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

In May 2014, Remnick served as the commencement speaker at the 160th commencement of Syracuse University.

==Personal life==

In 1987, Remnick married reporter Esther Fein in a Jewish ceremony at the Lincoln Square Synagogue in Manhattan. Fein has worked as a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. The couple has three children, Alex, Noah, and Natasha. Remnick is fluent in Russian.

<doc id="383275" wikidata="Q657196" url="?curid=383275" title="Medley swimming">
<text>Medley swimming is a combination of four different swimming strokes (freestyle (usually front crawl), backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly) into one race. This race is either swum by one swimmer as individual medley (IM) or by four swimmers as a medley relay.

== Individual medley ==
Individual medley consists of a single swimmer swimming equal distances of the four strokes within one race.

=== Stroke order ===
Individual medley consists of four strokes. These four strokes go in an order by Butterfly, Backstroke, Breaststroke and finally Freestyle. The swimmer will swim one quarter of the race in each style, in a certain order. The strokes are swum in this order:

# Butterfly
# Backstroke
# Breaststroke
# Freestyle: It can be any stroke except butterfly, backstroke, or breaststroke. All swimmers use the front crawl.

=== Competitions ===
A number of competitions in the individual medley are regularly contested, by both men and women. The competitions are limited in that every distance must consist of either four lengths of the pool (100-yard or -meter) or a multiple of four lengths (200- or 400-yard/- meter), so that no stroke must change mid-length. Regardless of the length of the individual medley, each stroke comprises a quarter of the overall distance.

* 100 m/yd individual medley: Swam in short-course (25 m/yd pool) competition only. This is not an Olympic event.
* 200 m/yd individual medley: Swam in both short course and long-course (50 m pool) competitions. This was swum as an Olympic event in the 1968 Summer Olympics, Mexico City, Mexico but then omitted until the 1984 Summer Olympics, Los Angeles, United States. The event has been swum ever since.
* 400 m/yd individual medley: Swum in both short course and long course competitions. This has been an Olympic event since the 1964 Summer Olympics, Tokyo, Japan.

=== Technique ===
The technique for individual medley events does not differ much from the technique for the separate events for the four strokes. The main difference is the turning technique needed when transitioning from one stroke to the next stroke. Each section has to be completed as described by the stroke rules of this section.

The transitions are as follows:

* Butterfly to Backstroke
* Backstroke to Breaststroke
* Breaststroke to Freestyle

When transitioning from Butterfly to Backstroke, swimmers must abide by FINA rules and regulations in regards to turns. They are listed as follows:

* When transitioning from butterfly to backstroke, swimmers must be on their stomach, and touch the wall with both hands simultaneously, either in, out, or at the surface of the water, then turn in any matter they wish as long as the swimmer&#x27;s shoulder is vertical or towards the back when they leave the wall. An acceptable turn includes an open turn, which is commonly used. 
* When transitioning from backstroke to breaststroke, swimmers must touch the wall with some part of their body while still on their back. The swimmer&#x27;s shoulder may be turned vertical to the chest but no more than that when executing a turn. Some acceptable turns are the bucket turn, crossover turn, or an open turn.
* When transitioning from breaststroke to freestyle, swimmers must touch the wall with both hands simultaneously, similar to butterfly, either in, out, or at the surface of the water before turning. An acceptable turn includes an open turn.

For all the transitions, the swimmer may conduct their underwater phase for up to 15m, where then swimmers will have to resurface and continue swimming with proper technique.

== Medley relay ==
The medley relay consists of four different swimmers in one relay race, each swimming one of the four strokes.

=== Stroke order ===
The stroke order of the medley relay is different from that of the individual medley. Backstroke is the first event as this stroke is started from the water. If backstroke were not the first event, the starting backstroke swimmer and the finishing previous swimmer could block each other. The remaining strokes are sorted according to the speed, with breaststroke being the slowest, butterfly in the middle, and freestyle being the fastest stroke. The order of the strokes for medley relay is as follows:

* Backstroke
* Breaststroke
* Butterfly
* Freestyle: It can be any stroke except butterfly, backstroke, or breaststroke. Swimmers will generally use the front crawl.

Backstroke performances (only) are eligible for backstroke records, as they are performed under normal controlled starting conditions (i.e., reflex latency for the starting gun makes the average split time marginally quicker); for example, Ryan Murphy set the world record for the 100 m backstroke during the first leg of the medley relay at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

=== Competitions ===
There are a number of competitions swum regularly in medley relay, both by men and women.

*4×50 m/yd medley relay: Swum in both short course and long course pools. This is not an Olympic event.
*4×100 m/yd medley relay: Swum in both short course and long course pools. This was the first Olympic medley competition and has been swum since the 1960 Summer Olympics, Rome, Italy. The first Olympic butterfly event itself was first swum in the previous 1956 Summer Olympics.

Mixed-gendered medley relays were introduced at the 2014 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) (4×50 m) and 2015 World Aquatics Championships (). The event debuted at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics and 2020 Summer Olympics ().

Standard United States high school swim meets have short course events, that is the lengths are typically swum in a 25-yard or meter long pool. One relay event swum in State or Sectional Championships is the 4×50 yard medley relay.

Many collegiate programs hold competition in the 4×50 medley relay, and 4×100 medley relay.

=== Technique ===
The technique for medley relay events does not differ much from the technique for the separate events for the four strokes and the basic set of relay rules. The only difference between the Medley Relay and the Individual Medley is the order of the strokes and the number of swimmers. The order for the medley relay is: backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and freestyle.

The main difference is for the second, third, and fourth swimmers on the relay team. The first swimmer swims backstroke normally, but all of the following swimmers must accurately judge the swimmer current swimming&#x27;s distance, and conduct a relay dive right as the current swimmer touches the wall. There is no start signal for those swimmers. It is very important for the next swimmer off the block to accurately judge the time at which the swimmer in the water will touch the wall. A fast reaction could result in a significantly faster time in the race, but a false start (diving early) will result in a disqualification.

World Aquatics rules require that a foot of the second, third or fourth swimmer must be touching the platform while (and before) the incoming teammate is touching the wall; the starting swimmer may already be in motion, however, which saves 0.6 – 1 second compared to a regular start. Furthermore, many swimmers may perform better in a relay than in an individual race owing to a team spirit atmosphere. As a result, relay times are typically 2–3 second faster than the sum of best times of individual swimmers.

== History ==
Until 1952, the butterfly was not defined as a separate stroke from the breaststroke, and so medley races featured three styles: backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle. The usual distance of both the IM and the medley relay was thus 300 metres or yards rather than 400. During a 150-meter Individual Medley race, Henry Myers was one of the first to use an overarm recovery while swimming breaststroke, becoming one of the earliest forms of butterfly. In the United States, during the year of 1953, some medley races included the butterfly stroke, and the Amateur Athletic Union made it mandatory in 1954.

From the beginning of the medley events, swimming times have drastically decreased due to science, technology, and improved training; e.g. technical swimming suits that reduce drag in the water and underwater cameras that help to analyze a swimmer&#x27;s stroke.

== Rules ==
These are the official rules of World Aquatics, USA Swimming, and US Masters Swimming regarding medley swimming:

* In individual medley events, the swimmer covers the four swimming styles in the following order: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle.
* In medley relay events, swimmers will cover the four swimming styles in the following order: backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.
* Each section must be finished in accordance with the rule which applies to the style concerned.

Freestyle includes a special regulation for medley events:

* Freestyle means that in an event so designated the swimmer may swim any style, except that in individual medley or medley relay events, freestyle means any style other than backstroke, breaststroke or butterfly.

Additionally, the normal rules of relay events apply:

* Each swimmer should only swim in one leg of the relay
* The continuing swimmer should not start their leg until the previous swimmer has completed their leg
* No other team member shall jump into the pool apart from the one swimming the leg
* The proceeding swimmer&#x27;s feet should not leave the diving block until the previous swimmer has completed their leg
* There shall be four swimmers on each relay team
* Mixed relay teams must consist of two men and two women. (In any order)

Failure to abide by any of the rules listed above will result in a disqualification if found appropriate by the referee.

== Para-Swimmers in the Medley ==
In 1960, the U.S. Paralympics added swimming as a sport. Para-Swimming is where swimmers with physical disabilities can compete with other swimmers with physical disabilities in swimming. While swimming, those swimmers are not allowed to wear any prosthetics or any assistive devices.

While swimming the Individual Medley, para-swimmers are put into different categories depending on their physical disability. They are listed below:

* SM1: para swimmers who are highly affected in their arms, legs, and trunk.
* SM2: para swimmers who are highly affected in their trunks, legs, and hands. Their arms are a little more viable but are still affected.
* SM3: para swimmers who have lowly affected arms, but may be missing legs. Their legs and trunks remain barely viable.
* SM4: para swimmers who have trouble with their hands. They may be missing their hand(s).
* SM5: para swimmers who have difficulty coordinating in the water. Their legs are highly affected.
* SM6: para swimmers who have one side of their body heavily affected.
* SM7: para swimmers who have one side of their body moderately affected, but still have trouble.
* SM8: para swimmers who can use one arm, moderately affected legs, or lack overall muscle power.
* SM9: para swimmers who have a lot of weakness in one leg.
* SM10: para swimmers who have little issue(s) with their leg. They have trouble keeping a stroke pattern.

There are also visual ratings:

* SM11: para swimmers who are almost totally blind.
* SM12: para swimmers who have a hard time seeing.
* SM13: para swimmers who are able to see the end of the pool at the length of 5 meters.

And finally, there is an intellectual category:

* SM14: para swimmers who are intellectually challenged. They have difficulty understanding techniques and strategies.

<text>The Islamic Consultative Assembly (), also called the Iranian Parliament, the Iranian Majles (Arabicised spelling Majlis) or ICA, is the unicameral national legislative body of Iran. The parliament currently consists of 290 representatives, an increase from the previous 272 seats since the 18 February 2000 election.

==History==

===Islamic Republic of Iran===
Following the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the Senate of Iran was abolished and effectively succeeded by the Guardian Council, maintaining the bicameral structure of the Iranian legislature. In the 1989 constitutional revision, the &quot;National Consultative Assembly&quot; was renamed the &quot;Islamic Consultative Assembly&quot;.

Since the Iranian Revolution, the Parliament of Iran has been led by six chairmen. Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani served as the inaugural chairman from 1980 to 1989. Subsequently, Mehdi Karroubi held the position in two separate terms (1989–1992 and 2000–2004), followed by Ali Akbar Nategh-Nouri (1992–2000), Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel (2004–2008), Ali Larijani (2008–2020), and, since 2020, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf.

Throughout its history, the Parliament&#x27;s character has evolved from being a &quot;debating chamber for notables&quot; to a &quot;club for the shah&#x27;s &quot; during the Pahlavi era. In the era of the Islamic Republic, it has shifted to being a body primarily influenced by members of the &quot;propertied middle class.&quot;

=== 2017 attack ===

On 7 June 2017, there were shootings at the Iranian parliament and at the shrine of Ayatollah Khomeini. Gunmen opened fire at the Iranian Parliament and the mausoleum of religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini in Tehran. The attack on the mausoleum reportedly left 17 persons dead and more than 30 people injured. The parliament was attacked by four gunmen which left seven to eight people injured. Both attacks took place around the same time and appear to have been coordinated.

== Functions ==

The Islamic Consultative Assembly holds the authority to legislate laws on all matters within the boundaries defined by the Constitution. Nevertheless, it is restricted from enacting laws that contradict the fundamental principles of the official religion of the nation (Islam) or the Constitution itself.

Government bills are submitted to the Islamic Consultative Assembly only after obtaining the approval of the .

The Islamic Consultative Assembly possesses the prerogative to investigate and scrutinize all matters concerning the country.

International treaties, protocols, contracts, and agreements necessitate approval from the Islamic Consultative Assembly.

Sanctioning and obtaining national or international loans or grants by the government requires ratification from the Islamic Consultative Assembly.

The President must secure a vote of confidence from the Assembly, through a Council of Ministers approval, upon forming the government and prior to conducting any other business.

In the event that at least one-fourth of the total members of the Islamic Consultative Assembly raise a question to the President, or if any Assembly member poses a question to a minister regarding their duties, the President or the minister is obligated to attend the Assembly and address the query.

All legislation endorsed by the Islamic Consultative Assembly must be submitted to the Guardian Council. Within a maximum of ten days from its receipt, the Guardian Council must review the legislation to ensure its compatibility with Islamic criteria and the Constitution. If any incompatibility is identified, the legislation is returned to the Assembly for further review. Otherwise, the legislation is deemed enforceable.

== Eligibility ==

People need to sign up online and upload their university degree document. Candidates need to be 30 at least and 75 years maximum, have a master&#x27;s degree or equal Level 3 Islamic seminary, and be Iranian born.

==Membership==

Currently, there are 290 members of Parliament, elected for a four-year term. There are five seats reserved for religious minorities (1.7% of the total members), with two for the Armenians and one each for the Assyrians, Jews and Zoroastrians. About 8% of the parliament are women, while the global average is 13%.

The parliament can force the dismissal of cabinet ministers through no-confidence votes and can impeach the president for misconduct in office. Although the executive proposes most new laws, individual deputies of the parliament also may introduce legislation. Deputies also may propose amendments to bills being debated. The parliament also drafts legislation, ratifies international treaties, and approves the national budget.

All candidates running for election, and proposed legislation from the assembly must be approved by the Guardian Council. Candidates must pledge in writing that they are committed, in theory and in practice, to the Iranian constitution.

=== Constituencies ===

The parliament currently has 207 constituencies, including the five reserved seats for religious minorities. The remaining 202 constituencies are territorial, each covering one or more of Iran&#x27;s 368 counties.

==Leadership==

Members of Parliament elect their speaker and deputy speakers during the first session of Parliament for a one-year term. Every year, almost always in May, elections for new speakers are held in which incumbents may be re-elected.

The current Speaker of Parliament is Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, with First Deputy Speaker Hamid-Reza Haji Babaee and Second Deputy Speaker Ali Nikzad.

==Hack==
Prior to the 1 March legislative election, on February 14, 2024, the Assembly servers were hacked, revealing monthly payments of 270 million tomans to members. The following day, the voting system was hacked, and journalists were barred from entering.

==Current composition==

The last election of Parliament of Iran were held on 1 March 2024 and a second round was held on 10 May 2024 in those 22 districts where no candidate received 20% or more of the votes cast. More than 48,000 candidates registered, but leaving about 15,000 candidates to run for the 290 seats representing the 31 provinces. The final results showed that principlists won 233 of 290 seats in the assembly.

==Historical Composition==
==Building==

After 1979, the Parliament convened at the building that used to house the Senate of Iran. A new building for the Assembly was constructed at Baharestan Square in central Tehran, near the old Iranian Parliament building that had been used from 1906 to 1979. After several debates, the move was finally approved in 2004. The first session of the Parliament in the new building was held on 16 November 2004.

The old building is depicted on the reverse of the Iranian 100 rial banknote.

<text>Philipp Frank (March 20, 1884 – July 21, 1966) was a physicist, mathematician and philosopher of the early-to-mid 20th century. He was a logical positivist, and a member of the Vienna Circle. He was influenced by Mach and was one of the Machists criticised by Lenin in &quot;Materialism and Empirio-criticism&quot;.

==Biography==
He studied physics at the University of Vienna and graduated in 1907 with a thesis in theoretical physics under the supervision of Ludwig Boltzmann. He joined the faculty there in 1910. Albert Einstein recommended him as his successor for a professorship at the German Charles-Ferdinand University of Prague, a position which he held from 1912 until 1938. Doctoral students included Reinhold Furth and Peter Bergmann.

In 1938, he was invited by Harvard University to America as a visiting lecturer on quantum theory and the philosophy of modern physics. The Germans having invaded Czechoslovakia as he was about to begin his scheduled lecture tour, Frank, a Jew, never returned to his position at Prague. And instead became a lecturer on physics and mathematics at Harvard from that year until his retirement in 1954.

In 1947 he founded the Institute for the Unity of Science as part of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS). This arose after Howard Mumford Jones (then president of the AAAS) had issued a call to overcome the fractionalization of knowledge, which he felt the AAAS well suited to address. The institute held regular meetings attracting a broad range of participants. Quine regarded the organisation as a &quot;Vienna Circle in exile&quot;. Politically Frank was a socialist.

Astronomer Halton Arp described Frank&#x27;s Philosophy of Science class at Harvard as being his favorite elective.

His younger brother Josef Frank was a noted architect and designer.

==Frank on Mach&#x27;s principle==
In lectures given during World War II at Harvard, Frank attributed to Mach himself the following graphic expression of Mach&#x27;s principle:

&quot;When the subway jerks, it&#x27;s the fixed stars that throw you down.&quot;

In commenting on this formulation of the principle, Frank pointed out that Mach chose the subway for his example because it shows that inertial effects are not shielded (by the mass of the earth): The action of distant masses on the subway-rider&#x27;s mass is direct and instantaneous. It is apparent why Mach&#x27;s Principle, stated in this fashion, does not fit with Einstein&#x27;s conception of the retardation of all distant action.

<doc id="383282" wikidata="Q948329" url="?curid=383282" title="Character actor">
<text>A character actor is an actor known for playing unusual, eccentric or interesting characters in supporting roles, rather than leading ones. The term is somewhat abstract and open to interpretation. While all actors play &quot;characters&quot;, the term character actor is often applied to an actor who frequently plays a distinctive and important supporting role. In another sense, a character actor may also be one who specializes in minor roles.

A character actor may play a variety of characters in their career, often referred to as a &quot;chameleon&quot;, or may be known for playing the same type of roles. Character actor roles are more substantial than bit parts or non-speaking extras. The term is used primarily to describe television and film actors, as opposed to theater actors. An early use of the term was in the 1883 edition of &quot;The Stage&quot;, which defined a character actor as &quot;one who portrays individualities and eccentricities&quot;. Actors with a long career history of playing character roles may be difficult for audiences to recognize as being the same actor.

==Overview==
In contrast to leading actors, they are generally seen as less glamorous. While a leading actor often has the physical attractiveness considered necessary to play the love interest, a character actor typically does not. In fact, some character actors are known for their unusual looks. For example, Chicago character actor William Schutz&#x27;s face was disfigured in a car accident when he was five years old, but his appearance after reconstructive surgery helped him to be distinctive to theater audiences. Generally, the names of character actors are not featured prominently in movie and television advertising on the marquee, since a character actor&#x27;s name is not expected to attract film audiences. Some character actors have been described as instantly recognizable despite their names being little known. They are colloquially referred to as &quot;that guy&quot;, or &quot;that guy&quot; actors, as in the 2014 documentary &quot;That Guy Dick Miller&quot;; with a prime example of a &quot;that guy&quot; actor being John Carroll Lynch.

Over the course of an acting career, an actor can sometimes shift between leading roles and supporting roles. Some leading actors, as they get older, find that access to leading roles is limited by their age. Sometimes character actors have developed careers based on specific talents needed in genre films, such as dancing, horsemanship, acrobatics, swimming ability, or boxing. Many up-and-coming actors find themselves typecast in character roles due to an early success with a particular part or in a certain genre, such that the actor becomes so strongly identified with a particular type of role that casting directors and theatrical agents steer the actor to similar roles. Some character actors are known as &quot;chameleons&quot;, able to play roles that vary wildly, such as Gary Oldman and Christian Bale.

Many character actors tend to play the same type of role throughout their careers, like Harvey Keitel as tough, determined characters; Christopher Lloyd as eccentrics; Claude Rains as sophisticated, sometimes morally ambiguous men; Abe Vigoda as aging criminals; Fairuza Balk as moody goth girls; Doug Jones as non-human creatures; and Forest Whitaker as composed characters with underlying volatility. Ed Lauter usually portrayed a menacing figure because of his &quot;long, angular face&quot;, which was easily recognized in public, although audiences rarely knew his name. Character actors can play a variety of types, such as the femme fatale, gunslinger, sidekick, town drunk, villain, hooker with a heart of gold, and many others. Prolific character actors, such as Margo Martindale, are rarely out of work, and they often have long careers that span decades. They are often highly esteemed by fellow actors.

<text>Maria of Montferrat (1192–1212) was Queen of Jerusalem from 1205 until her death. She was the daughter of Isabella I of Jerusalem and her second husband, Conrad of Montferrat. Maria succeeded her mother under the regency of her half-uncle John of Ibelin. In 1210 Maria married John of Brienne and two became co-rulers of Jerusalem. She died giving birth to her successor, Isabella II.

==Childhood==
Maria was born in 1192 in Tyre to Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem. She was named after her maternal grandmother, Maria Komnene. Maria&#x27;s father was Isabella&#x27;s second husband, Marquis Conrad of Montferrat, and Maria was known as &quot;La Marquise&quot; after him. Conrad was assassinated on 28 April 1192. Isabella was pregnant at the time, but Maria may have been born before her father&#x27;s death.

Within a week of Conrad&#x27;s death, Isabella married Count Henry II of Champagne, who had had some misgivings because Isabella might be succeeded by Conrad&#x27;s child. Henry wanted to be on good terms with Aimery of Cyprus. Maria, his stepdaughter, and Alice and Philippa, his daughters with Isabella, were therefore betrothed to Aimery&#x27;s sons Guy, John, and Hugh, but Guy and John died young and only Alice&#x27;s betrothal to Hugh materialized into a marriage. Henry fell from a window to his death on 10 September 1197. Maria&#x27;s next stepfather was King Aimery. The surviving children of this marriage, Queen Isabella&#x27;s final, were two daughters, Sibylla and Melisende, and so Maria remained her mother&#x27;s heir presumptive.

==Reign==
Queen Isabella I died shortly after King Aimery in April 1205, two months after the death of their infant son. Five daughters survived Isabella and the eldest of them, 13-year-old Maria, succeeded to the throne of Jerusalem, while the crown of Cyprus passed to Maria&#x27;s stepbrother Hugh I. John of Ibelin was made regent; he was the half-brother of Isabella, who may have nominated him on her deathbed, and held the Lordship of Beirut, the richest fief in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. John ruled peacefully on Maria&#x27;s behalf for three years.

A search for a husband began in 1208. The plan to have the queen marry King Peter II of Aragon failed. King Philip II of France was visited by the bishop of Acre, Florent, and the lord of Caesarea, Aymar de Lairon, who asked him to find a capable candidate. The task proved difficult, and only in 1210 the king declared the search successful; an impoverished and aged knight, John of Brienne, had accepted. John arrived in Acre, the capital of the kingdom due to the fall of Jerusalem to the Muslims in 1187, on 13 September 1210. The Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Albert of Vercelli, pronounced Maria and John married the next day. Their coronation was held in the Cathedral of Tyre on 3 October.

Queen Maria died after giving birth to a daughter, Isabella II, in 1212. Though John had been a prudent king during their marriage, Maria&#x27;s death cast doubt on his future role. Isabella inherited Maria&#x27;s kingdom, while John continued to rule it on the infant&#x27;s behalf. Maria&#x27;s line became extinct in 1268 with the death of her great-grandson Conrad III, and the kingdom passed to the descendants of her half-sister Alice.

<text>Atlantic Coast Airlines (ACA) was an airline based in the United States owned by Atlantic Coast Holdings, Inc. It operated as United Express for United Airlines and Delta Connection for Delta Air Lines. It was headquartered in the Dulles area of unincorporated Loudoun County, Virginia, United States. Previously it was headquartered in Reston, unincorporated Fairfax County. Before then, it was headquartered in Sterling, unincorporated Loudoun County.

==History==
The airline was established and started operations on December 15, 1989, and had been in a marketing agreement with United Airlines since its inception. In 1999 it established Atlantic Coast Jet to operate as a Delta Connection carrier, but this was later reintegrated.

Atlantic Coast Airlines operated United Express flights out of Dulles and O&#x27;Hare International Airport in Chicago with Jetstream 32, Jetstream 41, DeHavilland DHC-8, Embraer 120 Brasilia and Canadair regional jet aircraft. Their Delta Connection flights out of Logan International Airport in Boston, New York City&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport, and Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Covington, Kentucky were operated with the Fairchild Dornier 328. During 2003 revenues were generated about 80% from United Express operations and 20% from Delta Connection.

United Airlines entered bankruptcy protection in December 2002. At that time United Airlines contracted a consulting firm, Bain, to renegotiate its regional partners contracts. Atlantic Coast Airlines employees and management went through a significant cost reduction program to remain competitive as a United Express carrier. Presented with overwhelming competition from other regional airlines Atlantic Coast Airlines and United Airlines were unable to negotiate a mutual agreement. At that time Atlantic Coast Airlines continued to honor its 10-year contract with United Airlines. Expecting that United would be unable to honor that contract, Atlantic Coast Airlines developed an alternate business plan.

After announcing plans to part with United Airlines, Atlantic Coast Airlines&#x27; significant cash position made it a prime target for a takeover attempt. Mesa Air Group launched an attempt at a hostile takeover in the summer of 2003, engaging in what some allege were significant U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission violations. At the same time the employees of Atlantic Coast Airlines organized a grass roots effort to avert the takeover attempt. Within a few months the stock purchase plan was removed by Mesa.

On November 19, 2003, Atlantic Coast Airlines announced that it would become a low-cost carrier under the name of Independence Air. Its status as a United Express carrier ended on August 4, 2004, and its status as a Delta Connection carrier ended November 2, 2004. Operations as Independence Air began on June 16, 2004. On January 5, 2006, Independence Air ceased operations.

On March 10, 2006, Northwest Airlines purchased the DOT Operating Certificate of then-Independence Air with the intent to use that certificate to form a new regional subsidiary. The result was Compass Airlines, which began service using Embraer E175 jets in August 2007.

<doc id="383305" wikidata="Q707186" url="?curid=383305" title="Joseph Wharton">
<text>Joseph Wharton (March 3, 1826January 11, 1909) was an American industrialist and philanthropist. He was instrumental in the development of the nickel and zinc metal industries in the United States. He created the first plant in the United States to produce metallic zinc, or spelter, and became the largest producer of nickel and pig iron in the country. His innovations in malleable nickel and magnetic nickel won him the gold medal at the Paris exposition of 1878. He was the largest shareholder in Bethlehem Steel, held multiple investments in railroads, and owned vast amounts of land containing iron, coal, copper and gold ores. He founded the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and was one of the founders of Swarthmore College.

==Early life and education==
Wharton was born in Philadelphia, on March 3, 1826, the fifth child of ten to William and Deborah Fisher Wharton. He was raised in the Quaker religion.

Wharton&#x27;s youth was spent in the family&#x27;s house near Spruce and 4th streets in Center City Philadelphia and at Bellevue, a country mansion near the Schuylkill River. He attended boarding schools in Byberry, Pennsylvania, and West Chester, Pennsylvania, as well as schools in Philadelphia. Between the age of 14 and 16, Wharton was prepared for college by a private tutor. At age 16, his health became a concern and he moved to East Fallowfield Township, Chester County, to work on the farm of Joseph and Abigail Walton for three years. During the winter months, he returned to Philadelphia and studied in the chemistry laboratory of Martin Hans Boyè and learned French and German languages.

Wharton matured to a strong frame, and was just over tall. He was accomplished in sports, including horseback riding, swimming, and rowing. He competed in crew races as a member of the Camilla Boat Club.

The University of Pennsylvania and Swarthmore College both granted him honorary degrees.

==Career==

When he was 19, Wharton apprenticed with an accountant for two years and became proficient in business methods and bookkeeping. In 1847, he partnered with his older brother Rodman to start a business manufacturing white lead. Wharton also partnered with his brother in a cottonseed oil business for four years but disbanded the venture in 1849. 

He started a business manufacturing bricks in 1849 using a patented machine which formed dry clay into bricks. He left the brick-making business due to the significant competition and cyclical business swings.

===Zinc and nickel manufacturing===
In 1853, Wharton joined the Pennsylvania and Lehigh Zinc Company near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He first managed the mining operation and then the zinc oxide works. Wharton negotiated a new charter for the works, and in the difficult financial environment of 1857–1858, he took over control of the zinc works, and managed it carefully so that it turned a profit. In 1859, he developed the first production of metallic zinc, or spelter, in the United States. He brought in experienced workers from the Vieille Montagne works in Belgium, built sixteen furnaces and by 1863 had produced nine million pounds of spelter.

Wharton was asked by James Pollock, the Director of the United States Mint, to secure an American source of nickel to provide raw material for the minting of one-cent coins. In 1863, he sold his interest in zinc and started the manufacture of nickel at Camden, New Jersey. He took a controlling interest in the Gap Mining Company, a nickel mine and refining works in Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania. In 1866, Congress passed a law authorizing the creation of a 3-cent coin consisting of 75% copper and 25% nickel, and the nickel, as it became known, was created.

He partnered with Theodor Fleitmann for several years to improve the manufacturing process. The Camden plant was located on the east side of 10th Street, adjacent to Cooper Creek, and had several large brick buildings and smokestacks. Wharton renamed the Camden plant the American Nickel Works, and his office there became his center of operations. In July 1868, the plant burned down but was quickly rebuilt with brick and stone replacing the original wood structure. Wharton had success due to his production of the first in the world malleable nickel. He also created nickel magnets, and received a Gold Medal at the Paris Exposition of 1878 for his inventions.

For the next 25 years, Wharton&#x27;s operations were the largest nickel manufacturer in the United States and produced 17% of the world&#x27;s supply. The surface deposits at the Gap mine were eventually depleted, and Wharton began to purchase nickel ore from mines in the Sudbury Basin.

After the American Civil War, demand for coinage declined and the amount of nickel purchased from Wharton by the United States Mint decreased. Wharton became frustrated with the Mint since they had requested that he enter the nickel industry. He did not sell any nickel to the mint in 1870 and 1871 and temporarily closed the plant in 1870. He threatened to completely close the only nickel manufacturer in the United States.

By the 1870s, Wharton had made several million dollars in profit from his nickel business. He made huge profits from 1873 to 1876 by supplying Prussia with nickel to mint their coins. In 1877, the price of nickel plummeted due to new reserves discovered in New Caledonia and the formation of the French conglomerate Société Le Nickel. By 1900, the nickel industry outlook was fading and Wharton and a group of other American and Canadian nickel enterprises formed the International Nickel Company in 1902. In 1905, Wharton&#x27;s American Nickel Works were merged with the Orford Copper Company which ended Wharton&#x27;s involvement in nickel manufacturing.

===Water supply efforts===
The Wharton family&#x27;s Bellevue Mansion estate in North Philadelphia, along with several others nearby that had been annexed into the city, were threatened with condemnation by the city for the construction of a new reservoir to hold potable water. Wharton started purchasing land in South Jersey in the 1870s, eventually acquiring in the Pinelands, which contained an aquifer replenished by several rivers and lakes. The water from the Pinelands was relatively pure and he planned to export the water to Philadelphia. Wharton suggested that a city-controlled company could develop the necessary water mains and pump, funded by public purchase of stocks and bonds. Opposition to the plan emerged in Philadelphia and in New Jersey, and eventually, a law was passed in New Jersey preventing the export of water.

===Mining and railroads===
Wharton traveled widely and became involved in many industrial enterprises such as mines, factories and railroads. He started several enterprises on South Jersey property, including a menhaden fish factory that produced fertilizer, a modern forestry planting operation, and cranberry and sugar beet farms. Wharton purchased land in Port Oram, New Jersey, to expand his iron operations. He added furnaces to the site with the capacity to produce over 1,000 tons of iron per day.

He owned over 5,000 acres of ore-containing land. He had extensive ownership of coal-containing lands, with 7,500 acres in Indiana County, Pennsylvania, and 24,000 acres in West Virginia and New York. He owned iron and copper mines in Michigan, and gold mines in Arizona and Nevada. Wharton became involved in railroads including the Reading, Lehigh Valley Railroad, San Antonio Railroad, Arkansas Pass Railroad, Oregon Pacific Railroad, and Hibernia Mine Railroad.

===Bethlehem Steel===

In the 1870s Wharton began to invest in Bethlehem Iron Company which produced pig iron and steel for railroads. He became the largest shareholder with a position on the board of managers, and eventually purchased a controlling share of the company. He was the largest single producer of pig iron in the United States. In 1885, Wharton successfully bid a contract with the United States Navy for forged steel armor, and in 1886 he visited England (Whitworth Co.) and France (Schneider Co.) to research the designs for a plant to forge steel of higher quality. With these designs, Bethlehem Iron built the first plant to forge high-strength steel in the United States. The plant fabricated armor plates and guns for warships.

===Science===
Wharton was a scientist interested in the natural world, and wrote scientific papers on a variety of topics including astronomy and metallurgy, presenting several to the American Philosophical Society. He was elected to the Society in 1869. 

In the winter of 1883–1884 there was a period of several months when sunsets were extraordinarily red worldwide. Some imagined that the red color was from dust dispersed in the atmosphere worldwide by the volcano Krakatoa, which erupted. Others imagined that the reddish hue might come from iron and steel furnaces because they were known to create a reddish-brown dust. Wharton was curious, and one morning when a light snow was falling, collected some from a field near his house, melted and evaporated it, studying the remaining particles under a microscope, which he had on hand for metallurgy. The particles looked like &quot;irregular, flattish, blobby&quot; glass particles. He visited a ship from Manila that arrived in port in Philadelphia, a course that took a few hundred miles from Krakatoa. It had been slowed by a huge amount of pumice floating in the ocean, evidently spewed out by Krakatoa. Wharton obtained some pumice from one of the ship&#x27;s crew, compared it with the dust he had collected, and found almost identical particles. In 1893, Wharton presented a paper about the dust to the 150th anniversary meeting of the American Philosophical Society. 

Wharton also wrote a paper about the use of the Doppler effect on the color of light emitted by binary stars to determine their distance from Earth, and made the analogy to a train whistle which changes tone as it passes.

Wharton served as president of the American Iron and Steel Association and as a member of the Iron and Steel Institute. He led the electoral tickets for the Republican Party nomination of William McKinley for president.

==Philanthropy==
===Swarthmore College===

In 1864, Wharton along with his mother Deborah Fisher Wharton and a group of like-minded Hicksite Quakers from Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York City were the founders of Swarthmore College, a Hicksite Quaker college outside Philadelphia. Swarthmore filled an important need of a college where both men and women could receive a high-quality education in the tradition of Friends not dominated by religion.

Wharton donated $150,000 for the construction of Wharton Hall, $40,000 for the endowment of the Chair of Economics and Political Science, $10,000 for the construction of a library, $15,000 for the construction of a Friends Meeting House, and $10,000 for the construction of a science hall. His mother Deborah served on the Swarthmore Board of Managers from 1862–1870, and Joseph served on the board from 1870–1909, and from 1883–1907 as its president. He was often on campus and gave many commencement addresses.

===Wharton School===

Wharton wrote extensively on economic matters, including protective tariffs and business cycles. In the last half of the 19th century, business education typically consisted mainly of training on the job or an apprenticeship. Wharton conceived of a school that would teach how to develop and run a business, and to anticipate and deal with the cycles of economic activity. 

In 1881, Wharton donated $100,000 to the University of Pennsylvania to found a &quot;School of Finance and Economy&quot; to help students succeed in business. He insisted that the Wharton School faculty educate on economic protectionism, similar to the lobbying he had done for American businesses in Washington. However, the school soon began to broaden its outlook to a global one and to teach other disciplines such as politics and the developing social sciences, and introduced the teaching of business management and finance as these disciplines gradually coalesced. The Wharton School was the first to include such a practical focus on business, finance, and management. During its first century through the present day, it was and is widely known as one of the most prominent schools of business in the world. In 2023, the Wharton School fell off of the &quot;Financial Times&quot;″ 2023 MBA rankings for the first time since the ranking&#x27;s inception.

==Final years and death==

Wharton was active to near the end of his life both physically and in business affairs. Until he was 72, he skated with guests on the pond at his Ontalauna estate near Philadelphia and would often go on walks with his family after dinner. He practiced total abstinence from tobacco and restricted use of alcohol. When he was nearly 80, he visited his Nevada silver mine by canoeing down the Colorado River and descending into the mine in a bucket, and when he was 81, he traveled to Germany with his grandson, Joseph Wharton Lippincott, to visit Kaiser Wilhelm II and had dinner on the kaiser&#x27;s yacht.

He read widely in literature and was an accomplished poet. Many of his poems were inspired by trips abroad. He wrote &quot;Stewardson&#x27;s Yarn&quot; after an 1873 visit to Europe, &quot;The Royal Palm&quot; and &quot;The &#x27;Sweet Reasonableness&#x27; of a Yankee Philistine in Cuba&quot; after a visit to Cuba to inspect mines there, and &quot;Mexico&quot; after an 1889 visit to Mexico. A domestic journey to Nevada to see his gold mines there resulted in &quot;The Buttes of the Canyon&quot;.

In 1907, Wharton experienced a stroke while travelling in London. He survived the stroke and was able to travel home but never fully recovered his health. In 1908 he established the Wharton Steel Company with assets valued over $10 million and transferred all of his coke, iron, limestone, pig iron and railroad interests into this entity. His health was worsened by a fall and he died at his Ontalauna estate on January 11, 1909, at age 82. He was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

==Personal life==
Wharton married Anna Corbit Lovering, on June 15, 1854. After living with Anna&#x27;s family for several months, the couple moved into a near 12th and Walnut streets in Philadelphia. They had a daughter named Joanna. Wharton lived apart from the family while managing the zinc works in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Anna cared for their child at their home in Philadelphia.
In 1856, Wharton rented the house in Philadelphia and moved with his family to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. After Wharton sold his interest in zinc, they returned to Philadelphia. He purchased a 63-acre estate in the Branchtown neighborhood of Philadelphia, and built a Second Empire style mansion he named &quot;Ontalauna&quot;.

He was a member of the Union League of Philadelphia.

In the 1880s, Wharton purchased land in Jamestown, Rhode Island, and built an estate he named &quot;Marabella&quot; for usage as a summer residence.
Wharton is the grandfather of the publisher Joseph Wharton Lippincott, great grandfather to the publisher Joseph Wharton Lippincott Jr. and the great-great-great grandfather of former UCLA and Miami Dolphins quarterback Josh Rosen.

==Legacy==
In 1908, Wharton granted a plot of forested land to the city of Philadelphia for the creation of a park. In 1954, the Wharton family sold his vast Pinelands properties in South Jersey to the state of New Jersey, which now form the core of Wharton State Forest.

In 1981, a Joseph Wharton 18-cent commemorative postal stamp designed by Rudolph de Harak, was issued to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Wharton School.

In 1997, Wharton has inducted into the National Mining Hall of Fame.

The borough of Wharton, New Jersey, originally known as Port Oram, was renamed in his honor.

<text>French Sign Language (, LSF) is the sign language of deaf and hard-of-hearing people in France and in French-speaking parts of Switzerland. According to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, it has 100,000 native signers.

French Sign Language is related and partially ancestral to Dutch Sign Language (NGT), Flemish Sign Language (VGT), Belgian-French Sign Language (LSFB), Irish Sign Language (ISL), American Sign Language (ASL), Quebec (also known as French Canadian) Sign Language (LSQ), Brazilian Sign Language (LSB or Libras) and Russian Sign Language (RSL).

== History ==

French Sign Language is frequently, though mistakenly, attributed to the work of Charles Michel de l&#x27;Épée (l&#x27;abbé de l&#x27;Épée). In fact, he is said to have discovered the already existing language by total accident; having ducked into a nearby house to escape the rain, he fell upon a pair of deaf twin sisters and was struck by the richness and complexity of the language that they used to communicate among themselves and the deaf Parisian community. The abbé set himself to learning the language, now known as Old French Sign Language, and eventually he established a free school for the deaf. At this school, he developed a system he called &quot;methodical signs&quot;, to teach his students how to read and write. The abbé was eventually able to make public demonstrations (1771–1774) of his system, demonstrations that attracted educators and celebrities from all over the continent and that popularised the idea that the deaf could be educated, especially by gesture.

The methodical signs he created were a mixture of sign language words he had learned with some grammatical terms he invented. The resulting combination, an artificial language, was over-complicated and completely unusable by his students. For example, where his system would elaborately construct the word &quot;unintelligible&quot; with a chain of five signs (&quot;interior-understand-possible-adjective-not&quot;), the deaf natural language would simply say &quot;understand-impossible&quot;. LSF was not invented by the abbé, but his major contributions to the deaf community were to recognize that the deaf did not need oral language to be able to think, and to indirectly accelerate the natural growth of the language by virtue of putting so many deaf students under a single roof.

From this time French Sign Language flourished until the late 19th century when a schism developed between the manualist and oralist schools of thought. In 1880 the Milan International Congress of Teachers for the Deaf-Mute convened and decided that the oralist tradition would be preferred. In due time the use of sign language was treated as a barrier to learning to talk and thus forbidden from the classroom.

This situation remained unchanged in France until the late 1970s, when the deaf community began to militate for greater recognition of sign language and for a bilingual education system. In 1991 the National Assembly passed the Fabius law, officially authorising the use of LSF for the education of deaf children. A law was passed in 2005 fully recognising LSF as a language in its own right.

===Alphabet===
The French manual alphabet is used both to distinguish signs of LSF and to incorporate French words while signing.

<text>Burford is a rural community and is part of the County of Brant, in central southwestern Ontario. It has 1,058 residents (2021 Census). It is located eight kilometres west of the City of Brantford along Highway 53, and seventy kilometres east of London, Ontario. It is approximately 100 km southwest of Toronto.

Administrative offices for the County of Brant are located in Burford, making it one of three service hubs for the county (the others being Paris and St. George). Amongst designated heritage properties in the area is the former Burford Armoury, built in 1906, which was important for military training in earlier days when Canada had an active militia force in each county (the role now served by the Canadian Forces Reserves).

Burford is home to the Burford Bulldogs, a junior hockey team that plays in the Provincial Junior Hockey League.

Burford has a local golf course, Burford Golf Links, which was founded in 1980. It has gone through a number of different owners and is now part of the GolfNorth group of golf courses.

Burford also hosts the Burford Fall Fair every year. The fair was established in 1858 and after being hosted in Harley as the World&#x27;s Fair, was relocated to Burford, when the Burford fair grounds were purchased in 1893. Over the years the Burford fair has grown from a one-day fair in 1893 to its current three days, hosted every Thanksgiving weekend. The fair attracts tourists and visitors from the surrounding towns as well as larger county of Brant and beyond.

==History==
Burford, at one time known as Claremont, was the largest community in the former Burford Township (land area 71,122 acres (287.82 km2), population (1996) 5858), which included Cathcart, Harley, Princeton and other smaller communities. Burford Township was part of the County of Oxford before the formation of Brant County in 1851, and due to its location on the primary roadway leading into Oxford, built upon the ancient footpath leading from Burlington Bay through Brant&#x27;s Ford to the Thames River known as the Detroit Trail, Burford was Oxford&#x27;s gateway community. In the days before automobiles it served a great many travellers, but now is hardly noticed by motorists with distant destinations. Burford&#x27;s &#x27;downtown&#x27;, the intersection of Maple Avenue and King Street (Highway 53), now includes only a stop light, several small businesses and a post office.

===Early history===
The community was founded by the family of Abraham Dayton, who was granted authority in 1793 to settle Burford Township with a religious congregation led by the Public Universal Friend, whom Governor Simcoe believed to be Quakers. According to Burford historian Robert Muir, &quot;Wilkinson had drawn together a considerable body of free thinkers, undecided characters, and disgruntled members of other Christian bodies. These followers... were looked upon by the inhabitants who surrounded them, as a set of religious fanatics&quot; who &quot;decided at last, like the followers of Joseph Smith at a later date, to seek out a &quot;New Canaan&quot;&quot; and appointed Dayton as their emissary to seek land in Upper Canada. &quot;Abraham Dayton was an intelligent and estimable citizen, and his connection with the peculiar religious society, the infliction of whose presence Burford narrowly escaped, which first brought him to Burford, was doubtless brought about by force of circumstances and the nature of his local surroundings.&quot;

Dayton fell ill and became bedridden shortly after moving his family into Burford, so continuation of work to bring settlers into the township fell to his son-in-law, Benajah Mallory. Dayton died in 1797 and his family&#x27;s control of the township was rescinded by the government the same year. Benajah Mallory inherited the land which had been claimed by Dayton (including 600 acres at the western end of what became Burford Village) and he remained the flamboyant, but disgruntled leader of the settlement, and was elected as the member in the provincial assembly in 1804 and again in 1808 for Oxford, Norfolk and Middlesex. As a politician he was aligned with opposition members led by Joseph Willcocks, and with Willcocks turned traitor half way through the War of 1812.

===Duncombe rebellion===

Shortly after the outbreak of the Rebellion of 1837 in Toronto, Burford Township was the centre of an abortive rebellion in the London District of Upper Canada led by Dr. Charles Duncombe. An American by birth, Duncombe made his home east of Burford Village in 1828 and by popular demand entered politics, being elected to the legislative assembly as member for Oxford County in 1830 and again in 1834. He was increasingly drawn to a leadership role for the Reform cause and by 1837 was as well known in the province as William Lyon Mackenzie. Duncombe was at his home in Burford when rumour arrived that Mackenzie had launched his Rebellion and his supporters had taken control of Toronto. &quot;Carried away with the excitement of Mackenzie s reputed success, the people of South Dumfries, Oxford, Burford and Oakland urged Dr. Duncombe to lead a movement in support of the advance on the capital. Reluctantly, 
but willing to stake everything on the result of a strike for freedom, he consented, and appointed a rendezvous at the Village of Scotland&quot; with the intention of marching through Oakland township, Brantford and Hamilton to support Mackenzie. Over 300 men had gathered in Oakland before the news arrived that Mackenzie had been defeated, and on learning this, Duncombe ordered those in Oakland to disband.

The antithesis of Duncombe and Mallory, Charles Strange Perley then came to the fore, as described in Beer &amp; Company&#x27;s History of the County of Brant (1883): &quot;In this township, where fifty years ago political passions were so heated, it is pleasant to look back on the honourable career of some of the leading men who, though keen partisans, have closed their course amid the applause of both sides in the political arena. Such a man, on the Loyalist side, was Charles S. Perley, the well-known Colonel Perley of the last forty years of Burford&#x27;s history. His burly figure, genial face, and brusque manner, the boisterous frankness of Squire Western masking the kindly nature of an Allworlhy, will long be remembered by the people of Bishopsgate and Burford Villages, among whom his life was spent... In 1837 Mr. Perley took an active part in raising a company, which he commanded with the rank of Captain, confirmed to him in 1838. He received and most hospitably entertained Colonel MacNab and those &quot;Men of Gore,&quot; the Wentworth Militia, in their march against Duncombe&#x27;s force at Scotland. Captain Perley accompanied the Loyalists when they occupied Scotland, where Duncombe&#x27;s force being disbanded, they found no enemy on whom to exercise their valour. Then followed the &quot;Tory Terror,&quot; which lasted till peremptory orders from England and the recall in disgrace of Sir Francis Bond Head gave it a sudden check. But in those days Captain Perley was quite ready and willing to hang a good many of those neighbours to whom for many years of his after life he showed such unfailing kindness... For his many services he was soon promoted to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel. But his life was thenceforward to be that of a man of peace, erecting mills clearing farms, introducing new agricultural improvements, and by action and counsel aiding in the development of the township in which he lived.&quot;

===Railway development===

The railway era dawned in the area in 1853 with the opening of the Great Western Railway between Hamilton and London, but it passed north of Burford, leaving the community languishing as horse-drawn traffic dwindled along its main roadway. A new boost of prosperity came when a rail line was opened from Brantford to Norwich and Tillsonburg in Oxford County in 1878, passing through Burford south of the fairgrounds. Initially the advantage was easier access to and from Brantford and Tillsonburg by rail for passengers, and Burford remained a quiet village, described in 1883 as &quot;built up to a great degree by farmers who have realized enough to retire from business and take up their abode there. In summer time Burford Village is as pleasant a holiday resort as can be found in the Province, and the hotel provides most comfortable accommodation. There are no saloons or liquor stores; the village enjoys an Arcadian freedom from drunkenness and other offences against law and order.&quot; It was probably this which convinced British artist Robert Whale to make Burford his home when he brought his family to Canada. Eventually a milk processing factory and a canning factory located on the rail line at Burford, and freight traffic kept the line in operation for a century, but it was abandoned between Burford and Tillsonburg in 1987, and between Brantford and Burford in 2001. The tracks have since then been removed along the line, but the path of the railway right-of-way is still visible using Google Maps satellite view.

===Recent history===
Burford is now populated by Canadians of German, Dutch and British backgrounds. In 1999, Burford became part of the County of Brant, an amalgamation of several local municipalities including Brantford Township, the town of Paris, Oakland Township, Onondaga Township and South Dumfries Township. The current mayor of the County of Brant is David Bailey.

Historically, when tobacco was lucrative, the farms and families surrounding Burford were relatively prosperous. However, when smoking habits began to change in the 1980s, the economy slipped into decline. Currently, farmers are more likely to be growing ginseng for Asian markets than tobacco. Dairy, poultry, hog and fish farming persist and range from large scale commercial operations to subsistence type family farms. The community has lost population since the 1970s and is eager to attract new investment.

==Education==

Burford District High School was the only secondary institution for eighty years, opening in 1922 and closing in June 2002 due to low enrollment. The building was then revamped to become Burford District Elementary School and drew students from three elementary schools which were closed around the same time: Maple Avenue, Coronation and Harley-Northfield. The Maple Avenue School was also home to the Burford Islamic School or Darul Uloom Al Islamiah Burford, a private school with a Muslim based education. The building is now for sale after multiple incidents of defacement resulted in the closure of the school. Most high school age students now attend Paris District High School, Brantford Collegiate Institute or Assumption College and St. John&#x27;s College Catholic schools.

<text>The 2004 United States House of Representatives elections were held on November 2, 2004, to elect all 435 seats of the chamber. It coincided with the re-election of President George W. Bush as well as many Senate elections and gubernatorial elections. Prior to the election in the 108th Congress, Republicans held 227 seats, Democrats held 205, with two Republican vacancies and one independent. As a result of this election, the 109th Congress began composed of 232 Republicans, 201 Democrats, one independent (who caucuses with the Democrats), and one vacancy (Democrat Bob Matsui won reelection but died just two days before the beginning of the 109th Congress).
Democrats won open seats in Colorado, South Dakota, and New York while ousting incumbents in Georgia and Illinois. Republicans won an open seat in Kentucky while ousting an incumbent in Indiana. They gained five seats in Texas after a controversial mid-decade redistricting placed several rural Democratic incumbents into new districts. Two seats in Louisiana swapped party control.

As of 2025, this is the last election in which someone who was not from the Democratic or Republican Party was elected to the House (Independent Bernie Sanders). Republicans would not make consecutive net gains in the House (after gaining seats in the 2002 election) until 2020 and 2022. This was also the last election in which the Republicans made any gains in a presidential election year until 2020.

<doc id="383326" wikidata="Q654444" url="?curid=383326" title="Inkatha Freedom Party">
<text>The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP; ) is a conservative political party in South Africa, which is a part of the current South African government of national unity together with the African National Congress (ANC). Although registered as a national party, it has had only minor electoral success outside its home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who served as chief minister of KwaZulu during the Apartheid period, founded the party in 1975 and led it until 2019. He was succeeded as party president in 2019 by Velenkosini Hlabisa.

During the first decade of the post-Apartheid period, the IFP received over 90% of its support from ethnic Zulus. Since then, the party has worked to increase its national support by promoting social and economic conservative policies. In the 2019 general election, the IFP came in fourth place nationally, winning 3.38% of the vote and 14 seats in the National Assembly.

In the 2024 general election, IFP won 17 seats with 3.85% of the vote. In June 2024, Inkatha Freedom Party agreed to join the ANC-led government of national unity (GNU). Leader of the IFP, Velenkosini Hlabisa, became
Minister of the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) in the coalition.

== Policies and ideology ==
Policy proposals of the IFP include:
* Devolution of power to provincial governments
* Making the head of state and head of government posts separate, with a ceremonial figurehead as head of state.
* Mixed-member proportional representation for the National Assembly.
* Liberalisation of trade
* Lower income taxes.
* Looser labour laws
* Autonomy for traditional African communities and their leaders
* Allowing traditional authorities to exercise local government functions
* Opposing the notion that tribalism is inherently regressive and antithetic to development and progress.
In 2018, the party issued an official statement, penned by MP, Narend Singh, stating that the time had come to discuss the possibility of reinstating the death penalty in South Africa.

Ideologically, the party has been positioned on the right-wing of the spectrum, although on its platform the IFP places itself in the political centre ground, stating it rejects &quot;both centralised socialism, as well as harsh &quot;anything goes&quot; liberalism.&quot; The party states that it bases its values on &quot;Ubuntu/Botho&quot; tribal values and supports a pluralist, shared future for South Africa in which all groups have equal rights. The party supports strong law &amp; order policies, in particular calling for harsher penalties for people who commit violence against women and children. The IFP supports the Zulu monarchy and investing more powers and recognition of the constitutional monarch of the KwaZulu-Natal region. In 2023, the party criticised the African National Congress&#x27; close relations to Hamas and Iran following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and denounced antisemitism in South Africa.

== History ==
=== Apartheid era ===
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a former member of the ANC Youth League, founded the Inkatha National Cultural Liberation Movement (INCLM) on 21 March 1975. In 1994, the name was changed to Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). Buthelezi used a structure rooted in &quot;Inkatha&quot;, meaning &quot;crown&quot; in Zulu, a 1920s cultural organisation for Zulus established by his uncle, Zulu king Solomon kaDinuzulu. The party was established in what is now KwaZulu-Natal, after which branches of the party quickly sprang up in the Transvaal, the Orange Free State and the Western Cape.

Because of Buthelezi&#x27;s former position in the African National Congress, the two organisations were initially very close and each supported the other in the anti-apartheid struggle. However, by the early 1980s the Inkatha had come to be regarded as a thorn in the side of the ANC, which wielded much more political force through the United Democratic Front (UDF), than Inkatha and the Pan Africanist Congress. Although the Inkatha leadership initially favoured non-violence, there is clear evidence that during the time that negotiations were taking place in the early 1990s, Inkatha and ANC members were at war with each other, and &quot;Self-Protection Units (SPUs)&quot; and &quot;Self-Defence Units (SDUs)&quot; were formed, respectively, as their protection forces.

As a Homeland leader, the power of Buthelezi depended on the South African state and economy. With anti-apartheid leaders inside South Africa and abroad demanding sanctions, Buthelezi came to be regarded more and more as a government puppet, along with other Bantustan leaders. His tribal loyalties and focus on ethnic interests over national unity were also criticised as contributing to the divisive programme of Inkatha. This led to a virtual civil war between Zulu loyalist supporters and ANC members in KwaZulu-Natal. Although Inkatha was allied with the African National Congress in the struggle against apartheid, they took opposing views on sanctions placed by the international community on South Africa. In 1984, Buthelezi travelled to the USA and met personally with President Ronald Reagan and argued divestment was economically harming black South African workers.

Fearing erosion of his power, Buthelezi collaborated with the South African Defence Force, and received military training for Zulu militia from SADF special forces starting in the 1980s as part of Operation Marion. Inkatha members were involved in several massacres in the run-up to South Africa&#x27;s first democratic elections, including the Trust Feed massacre on 3 December 1988, and the Boipatong massacre on 17 June 1992. In November 1993, the IFP signed a solidarity pact with the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, with the AWB providing the IFP with military training and agreeing that &quot;Boer and Zulu would fight together for freedom and land should they be confronted by a common enemy&quot;.

During the phase of establishing a constitution for South Africa and prior to the first free elections in South African history, bloodshed frequently occurred between Inkatha and the ANC. Both Inkatha and the ANC attempted to campaign in each other&#x27;s KwaZulu-Natal strongholds, and were met with resistance, sometimes violent, by members of the opposing party. Inkatha was also initially opposed to parts of the proposed South African constitution regarding the internal politics of KwaZulu, and, in particular, they campaigned for an autonomous and sovereign Zulu king (King Goodwill Zwelethini kaBhekuzulu), as head of state.

As a result, Inkatha initially refused to register its intention to participate in the 1994 election, a necessity in order to receive votes. However, once it became obvious that its efforts were not going to stop the election, the party was registered as the Inkatha Freedom Party at the eleventh hour. However, due to their opposition to the constitution, concessions were made. KwaZulu-Natal, and thus all the other provinces, were granted double ballots for provincial and national legislatures, greater provincial powers, the inclusion of &#x27;KwaZulu&#x27; in the official name of the province (formerly &#x27;Natal&#x27;) and recognition of specific ethnic and tribal groups within the province.

On election day, the IFP displayed its political strength by taking the majority of the votes for KwaZulu-Natal.

=== Post-apartheid politics ===
After the dismantling of apartheid system in 1994, the IFP formed an uneasy coalition in the national government with their traditional political rival, the ANC. Despite these challenges, the coalition was to last until 2004, when the IFP joined the opposition benches.

The ANC/IFP rivalry, characterised by sporadic acts of political violence, has been firm since 1993. In 2004, while campaigning in Vulindlela, an IFP bastion in the Pietermaritzburg Midlands region, Thabo Mbeki was reportedly debarred by an IFP-affiliated traditional leader in Mafunze. Previously the stronghold of Moses Mabhida, this area has long been the site of heated clashes between the parties.

The IFP&#x27;s manifesto seeks the resolution to a number of South African issues, especially the AIDS crisis, in addition to addressing &quot;unemployment, crime, poverty and corruption and prevent the consolidation of a one-party state;&quot; said &quot;party&quot; is implied to be the ANC.

=== Gavin Woods report===
Gavin Woods, one of the party&#x27;s most respected MPs, drew up a highly critical 11-page internal discussion document at the request of the parliamentary caucus after a discussion in October 2004. In it, he said that the IFP &quot;has no discernible vision, mission or philosophical base, no clear national ambitions or direction, no articulated ideological basis and offers little in the way of current, vibrant original and relevant policies&quot;. Woods also warned the party that &quot;it must treat Buthelezi as the leader of a political party and not the political party itself&quot;. Woods pinpointed 1987 as the year when the IFP started losing ground as a political force. Before 1987, Woods contends, the party had a strong, unambiguous national identity. He further criticised the IFP&#x27;s inability to end the ANC&#x27;s campaign of violence against it, and an &quot;impotent&quot; attitude towards the attacks conducted against it by the ANC.

At the first caucus discussion, Woods read out the 11-page paper in full and caucus members were generally positive about its frank nature. IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi was absent from that meeting but raised it at a meeting of the party&#x27;s national council, which Woods did not attend. At a subsequent caucus meeting where both were present, Buthelezi read from a prepared statement attacking Woods. All the numbered copies were ordered to be &quot;shredded&quot; but some survived.

===Electoral decline===
After the 1994 elections, the IFP suffered a gradual decline in support. The party ceded control of the KwaZulu-Natal province to the ANC following the 2004 general election and its presence in Northern KwaZulu-Natal, its stronghold, started to become diminished. Party member Ziba Jiyane left the IFP to form the National Democratic Convention (Nadeco). Prominent IFP MP Gavin Woods and IFP ward councillors in KwaZulu-Natal joined his new party.

After the party&#x27;s results in the 2009 general elections, party members began debating a change in leadership for the 2011 local government elections. Buthelezi had previously announced his retirement but rescinded it. Senior IFP politician Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi wanted Buthelezi to step down and had supporters advocating for her to take over the party&#x27;s leadership. She later resigned from the party and formed a breakaway party, the National Freedom Party (NFP). The NFP obtained 2.4% of the national vote and 10.4% in KwaZulu-Natal in the 2011 municipal elections, mainly at the expense of the IFP.

In the 2014 general elections, the party achieved its lowest support levels since 1994. The party lost its status as the official opposition in the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature to the Democratic Alliance. Nationally, the party lost eight seats in the National Assembly. The NFP factor also contributed to the IFP&#x27;s decline on the national and provincial level.

Buthelezi later said in 2019 that the reason the party had lost support, was because of ANC president Jacob Zuma being from the Zulu tribe. He insisted that the exodus voters leaving the IFP occurred on ethnic grounds.

===Resurgence and succession===
In the 2016 municipal elections, the party&#x27;s support grew for the first time since 1994. The party had reclaimed support in Northern KwaZulu-Natal. The ANC and DA both suggested that the NFP not being able to participate in the election, contributed to the party&#x27;s surge in support. The party managed to retain control of the Nkandla Local Municipality, the residence of former ANC president Jacob Zuma.

In October 2017, Buthelezi announced that he would step down as leader of the IFP at the party&#x27;s National General Conference in 2019. The party&#x27;s Extended National Council pledged its support to Velenkosini Hlabisa, mayor of the Big Five Hlabisa Local Municipality, to succeed Buthelezi as party leader. The party grew its support in the May 2019 general elections and won back the title of official opposition in KwaZulu-Natal. Hlabisa became the leader of the opposition in the legislature, as he was the party&#x27;s premier candidate. Buthelezi confirmed his intention to stand down as leader. Hlabisa was elected president of the IFP at the party&#x27;s 35th National General Conference in August 2019.

===Return to power in KwaZulu-Natal Province===
In 2024, the IFP, which was by now in a coalition agreement with the ANC, as well as the Democratic Alliance (DA) and National Freedom Party (NFP) parties would regain the position of Premier of KwaZulu-Natal for the first time since 2004 after its candidate Thami Ntuli was elected by the province&#x27;s legislature. Ntuli&#x27;s election as premier was seen as a setback for the influence of Jacob Zuma, who by now had defected from the ANC to lead the KwaZulu-Natal based uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party. Ntuli defeated Zulu Nation deputy prime minister and MK party candidate Phathisizwe Chiliza with 41 votes to 39. He then took office and appointed his cabinet on 18 June 2024.

<text>John Elefante (born March 18, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer. From 1981-1984, he was lead vocalist of the rock group Kansas and is currently touring with several groups that have featured members from classic rock bands. His credits include writing and singing lead vocals on three multi-platinum albums. He produced albums that have earned numerous GMA Dove Awards, four Grammy Awards (most recently in 2000), and ten Grammy nominations. He has maintained a close working relationship with his brother, Dino, co-writer of several Kansas songs.

==Early life==
He was born in Levittown, New York, and his family soon moved to Long Beach, California. He sang and played drums for his family band, The Brotherhood.

==1981–1984: Kansas==
In late 1981, Elefante auditioned for his second band position, as the new lead singer and keyboardist for Kansas, after the departure of its co-founder Steve Walsh. The previous year, Kansas was one of the top-grossing concert acts in the world. Several of the top vocalists of the time applied for the job, including Sammy Hagar, Dennis &quot;Fergie&quot; Fredriksen, and Jim Stafford.

Elefante did lead vocals and keyboards on two albums, and was a major songwriter along with Kerry Livgren. On 1982&#x27;s &quot;Vinyl Confessions&quot;, he sang the No. 4 Billboard Mainstream Rock hit, &quot;Play the Game Tonight&quot;. He wrote &quot;Chasing Shadows and the Top 40 single, &quot;Right Away&quot;. In 1983, on the following album, &quot;Drastic Measures&quot;, he wrote &quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot;, which remains the band&#x27;s highest charting single at No. 3 (Mainstream Rock). He wrote &quot;Everybody&#x27;s My Friend&quot;, which is the second single and reached No. 34 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.

While with Kansas, he became a record producer. He issued &quot;Perfect Timing&quot; (1984) for the Southern California group, Sweet Comfort Band. Though not a major commercial success, Petra&#x27;s &quot;Back to the Street&quot; was a Grammy-nominated, breakthrough, commercial success for both Elefante and the band. He also contributed songwriting, keyboards, background vocals, and engineering to the effort.

In 1984, on the retrospective collection &quot;The Best of Kansas&quot;, he wrote the album&#x27;s one new track, &quot;Perfect Lover&quot;. That year, he, Kerry Livgren, and Dave Hope left the band.

==1985–1994==
In 1985, &quot;Young and Innocent&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; and was credited to &quot;Elefante&quot; – a collaborative effort by John and his brother Dino Elefante.

With both John and Dino Elefante as the band&#x27;s primary producers, Petra&#x27;s already popular Christian pop/rock niche was given a timely boost. Their accolades include multiple gold albums, 10 consecutive &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; Reader&#x27;s Choice Awards, induction into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and Hard Rock Cafe, and becoming the only artist to ever have four albums in the SoundScan top-100 Christian chart.

In 1987, while producing a various-artists album called &quot;California Metal&quot;, the album&#x27;s production team of John and Dino Elefante ended up one track short and they decided to add a song which had been written for Kansas called &quot;Wasn&#x27;t It Love&quot; (originally titled &quot;What About Love&quot;) as the band Mastedon. Regency later requested a full-length album which became Mastedon&#x27;s debut, &quot;It&#x27;s a Jungle Out There&quot;.

He produced Petra&#x27;s further releases, and 30 other albums. He usually performed on them, often sharing songwriting credits. He was committed as producer, eschewing other opportunities such as an offer to replace Bobby Kimball as lead singer for Grammy winners, Toto.

Elefante focused on heavier music in the early 1990s, including the Guardian release, &quot;Fire and Love&quot;, reaching regular rotation on MTV. He continued Mastedon with his brother. The band&#x27;s name is a pachyderm-inspired reference to the brothers&#x27; last name. Its albums feature multiple lead singers and performances by other artists, creating an eclectic sound anchored by Elefante&#x27;s songwriting. His brother Dino was songwriter and main guitarist.

Mastedon&#x27;s first release is &quot;It&#x27;s a Jungle Out There!&quot; (1989). In 1990, the band released &quot;Lofcaudio&quot;. This album continued the guest performance theme, though Elefante sang more of the lead vocals. Unfortunately, John and Dino&#x27;s production schedule preempted any touring to commercially support the album (though the band did appear at least one Christian rock festival, Cornerstone, in 1991). The albums charted at No. 25 and No. 10, respectively.

John and Dino Elefante formed their own record label, Pakaderm. Most of the music they produced in the next 10 years was released from it. With major distribution through Word Records and A&amp;M Records, Pakaderm became an important element in the brothers&#x27; success. Their label afforded them and their artists significant creative control, while still benefiting from major label resources.

With intense recording schedules in 1993, the brothers built their own recording studio in Nashville, called Sound Kitchen. In addition to their own productions, the brothers planned to rent time in the studio to other artists and producers.

==1995–1999==
Elefante continued as producer, became record label chief, and began a solo career. He released two solo albums: &quot;Windows of Heaven&quot; (1995) and &quot;Corridors&quot; (1997).

Under the brothers’ management, Sound Kitchen recorded artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, and Buddy Guy. The complex was soon expanded to .

Elefante was hired by Pamplin Records in 1998, working with Dino to generate artist development. They produced 32 albums, most of which feature Elefante as arranger and performer. The styles include rock, gospel, pop, and metal.

In 1999, Elefante released his most popular solo effort, &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; (1999). It spawned several hit singles and mainstream music videos. He planned a 25-date solo tour but he was badly injured in an accident before the first concert and had to cancel the tour.

==2000–2007==
Elefante rebounded, beginning with the production of Petra&#x27;s Grammy award-winning album, &quot;Double Take&quot;. He continued working at Pamplin, producing 20 more albums for them in just three years. Simultaneously, he and Dino continued managing Sound Kitchen.

In 2002, he left Pamplin after a string of successful albums, including the debut for Natalie Grant.

That year, John and Dino sold Sound Kitchen. It had become the largest recording studio in the southeastern United States. Artists included Alabama, Amy Grant, Barry Manilow, Brad Paisley, Brooks &amp; Dunn, Carrie Underwood, Dixie Chicks, Dolly Parton, Donna Summer, George Strait, Gretchen Wilson, Jewel, Jimmy Buffett, Julio Iglesias, Keith Urban, Kenny Rogers, LeAnn Rimes, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Michael W Smith, Peter Cetera, Reba McEntire, Rascal Flatts, Third Day, Trisha Yearwood, and Vince Gill.

Elefante started a new major-distributed label with his brother in 2003, Selectric Records. Co-managing the label with his brother, he produced 10 albums over the next three years. As a singer, he recorded with artists including Pat Boone and Bono.

In late 2006, the brothers closed the label but he produced three albums in 2007.

Elefante made a new Mastedon album, &quot;3&quot;, featuring former Kansas bandmate Kerry Livgren. Its style is similar to Mastedon, his Kansas work, and his solo albums.

==2010==
As of 2010, Elefante had produced and or performed on more than 100 major label albums.

In 2010, Big3 Records rereleased &quot;3&quot; as Elefante&#x27;s &quot;Revolution of Mind&quot;.

His latest studio album, &quot;On My Way to the Sun&quot;, released in May 2013, reunited Elefante with former Kansas bandmate Rich Williams and also featured current Kansas violinist David Ragsdale.

In 2013, Elefante released a single, &quot;This Time&quot; which was accompanied by a music video, that tells the story of his adopted daughter who was nearly aborted by her birth mother. The video shows a pregnant teenager entering an abortion clinic and then having a dream about a little girl she knew to be her unborn daughter.

Elefante is a member of the Jay Sekulow Band which is named after band leader Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law &amp; Justice (ACLJ), and one of Donald Trump&#x27;s personal lawyers during his US presidency.

<text>The Ballymun Flats referred to a number of flats—including the seven Ballymun [[High-rise building|tower blocks]]—in Ballymun, Dublin, Ireland. Built rapidly in the 1960s, there were 36 blocks in total, consisting of 7 fifteen-storey, 19 eight-storey, and 10 four-storey blocks. The complex was built in a Corbusian style known as towers in the park, which was popular in European and American cities in the mid-20th century.

The 15-storey blocks actually had 17 storeys, including the entrance floor and a plant room on their roofs. Joseph Plunkett tower, named after one of the signatories of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, was typical of the taller tower blocks. It was a 42-metre, 8,500-tonne building that housed 90 families in 30 three-, two-, and one-bedroom units.

The entire complex was demolished in the early 21st century. By October 2013, there were just three remaining blocks, all of which were empty. The last block was demolished in September 2015.

==History==

The Ballymun Flats were built in the 1960s to accommodate the rising population, particularly to accommodate former residents of inner-city areas which were being cleared in the process of 1960s urban slum clearances. Whilst suffering from a lack of sufficient public amenities, several schools served the area (Holy Spirit N.S. and Ballymun Comprehensive), as well as an Eastern Health Board medical centre and a purpose-built shopping centre. The area suffered from many social problems such as drugs and rampant crime. The causes of these social problems, and the subsequent discrimination faced by many people with Ballymun addresses when seeking employment outside the suburb, have been disputed, but Ballymun generally paralleled the experience of many working-class people in the 1960 and 1970s when placed in high-rise locations.

Despite the negative perceptions of many non-residents of Ballymun, many of the residents insist that there is a strong sense of pride and community in the area. Lynn Connolly, whose 2006 memoir &quot;The Mun: Growing Up in Ballymun&quot; detailed her raising there in the 1970s and 1980s, readily acknowledged the problems there and wanted to get out at the time. But she later came to realise that there had been much that was good at the towers – in terms of a collective wit among residents and a helping sense of community – which had been ignored by the media.

The Ballymun Flats were the first homes with cable television in Ireland. RTÉ Relays Ltd, a subsidiary of the national broadcaster RTÉ, installed cable television into the flats in 1963, giving each residence access to Irish stations such as RTÉ Television and UK stations such as BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, and from 1982, Channel 4.

==Four-storey flats==

The four-storey flats were situated on Sandyhill Avenue, Sillogue Avenue, and Shangan Avenue. They were the earliest complexes to be demolished. The former flats of Sillogue Avenue are now open land, whilst the former flats of Shangan Avenue have been replaced by new complexes. A new area called Marewood, consisting of houses and apartments, is now situated where the Sandyhill Avenue flats once stood.

==Eight-storey flats==

The eight-storey flats were situated along Balbutcher Lane, where there were two blocks; Shangan Road, where there were three blocks; Coultry Road, where there were four blocks; and Balcurris and Sillogue Roads, each of which had five blocks.

The flats had two different designs, the more common being with the lift on the opposite side of the stairwell, Balbutcher and Shangan were the only ones to feature this design. Balcurris contained one of the alternative blocks, Sillogue contained the alternative blocks and three of the other blocks, three of the four Coultry blocks were made contained the lift on the side of the stairwell. Balcurris was the only row of flats to have its blocks separated by a road, the latter three blocks faced a different direction to the first two blocks and were the most visible from Dublin Airport.

Balbutcher Lane was upgraded in the 1990s where only residents were allowed to enter and had to buzz their way in, visitors needed permission from residents in order to enter. Windows were placed on the balconies and post would be delivered similar to how an apartment block would receive their mail. Railings were also placed around the flats and a playground was built at the back of the complex.

Sections of Coultry and Balcurris were demolished first, with the latter becoming the first complex to be completely demolished by 2009, it was originally noted that the Ballymun Shopping Centre and Metro North would be situated on the old Balcurris site, although these plans failed to materialize. Many of the complexes were demolished by 2012, after the removal of the Sillogue flats. Balbutcher Lane were the last eight-storey flats to go in 2015.

==Fifteen-story flats==

The Ballymun tower blocks were seven landmark residential towers built in the 1960s. The seven towers were named after the seven leaders of the 1916 rising; Patrick Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh, Seán Mac Diarmada, Éamonn Ceannt, Thomas Clarke, James Connolly, and Joseph Plunkett.

In 2004, demolition of the first tower began. The Pearse tower was demolished slowly by mechanical means, whilst MacDermott and MacDonagh Towers were demolished by controlled implosion. Ceannt, Plunkett, Clarke, and Connolly towers were demolished by mechanical means.

The red aircraft warning lights on these structures were not connected to any form of back-up power for many years, leaving the towers completely dark in a power outage.

===Construction/Demolition===
*Patrick Pearse tower (1966–2004) was the first tower to be erected, in 1966. It was halfway through construction when the construction of MacDonagh Tower started. Pearse Tower was the first one to be demolished in 2004.
*Thomas MacDonagh tower (1966–2005) was the second tower, built in 1966, and in 2005 was demolished by controlled implosion.
*Éamonn Ceannt tower (1966–2005) was the third tower, built in 1966; in 2005 it was demolished.
*James Connolly tower (1966–2007) was the fourth tower, built in 1966. In 2007 it was demolished.
*Seán MacDermott tower (Seán Mac Diarmada) (1966–2005) was the fifth tower to be built, in 1966. In 2005, it was demolished by controlled implosion and collapsed in less than eight seconds.
*Thomas Clarke tower (1966–2008) was the sixth tower, built in 1966. Before it was demolished in 2008, the top floor was turned into a short-stay hotel.
*Joseph Plunkett tower (1967–2015) was the last one built, in 1967. The tower&#x27;s demolition began on 22 September 2015.

===Gallery===
==In popular culture==
* The line &quot;I see seven towers, but I only see one way out&quot; from U2&#x27;s 1987 song &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot; (on &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; album) refers to these towers. The link between the towers and the song was pervasive enough to be mentioned in some tourist books about Dublin.
* Ballymun flats feature in M. J. Hyland&#x27;s Booker-shortlisted novel &quot;Carry Me Down&quot; (2006), symbolising John&#x27;s family&#x27;s descent into poverty.
* The Ballymun Trilogy is a series of three plays about the process of change in Ballymun, written by Dermot Bolger and staged by the Axis Art Centre located close to the original site of McDonagh Tower. They are &quot;From These Green Heights&quot;, &quot;The Townlands of Brazil&quot;, and &quot;The Consequences of Lightning&quot;.
* Lynn Connolly followed up her memoir with a 2012 mystery set in the Ballymun flats entitled &quot;Elizabeth III&quot;&#x27;.
* On an episode of the podcast Song Exploder, U2&#x27;s Bono detailed the track &quot;Cedarwood Road&quot; focuses on the violence that youth faced in the Ballymun Flats community during the &#x27;70s.
* Ballymun also appears in the popular Irish film &quot;The Commitments&quot; where some of its residents become members of the titular band. This film was voted the best Irish film of the decade, favoured mostly for its wry humour. Some of the quips in the film directly reference this part of North Dublin.
* The flats feature in the opening scene of the 2004 film &quot;Adam &amp; Paul&quot; which follows a day in the lives of two addicts looking to score heroin. Later on in the film they return to the Ballymun flats, where they finally have success.

<text>Robert the Devil () is a legend of medieval origin about a Norman knight who discovers he is the son of Satan. His mother, despairing of heaven&#x27;s aid in order to obtain a son, had asked for help from the devil. Robert&#x27;s satanic instincts propel him into a violent and sinful life, but he eventually overcomes them to achieve repentance.

The story originated in France in the 13th century and has since provided the basis for many literary and dramatic works, most notably the Meyerbeer opera &quot;Robert le diable&quot;.

== Literature and legend ==

===Story===
The 19th-century Italian writer Arturo Graf gives this version of the legend in his 1889 book &quot;Il Diavolo&quot;:There was once a duchess of Normandy who was tormented with a desire to have children and yet could have none. Weary of recommending herself to God, who will not listen to her, she betakes herself to the Devil, and her wish is speedily satisfied. A son is born to her, a veritable firebrand. As an infant, he bites his nurse and tears out her hair; as a lad, he knifes his teachers; at the age of twenty, he becomes a bandit chief. He is dubbed knight, in the belief that thus the wicked instincts raging within him may be overcome; but thereafter he is worse than he was before. No one surpasses him in strength or in courage. In a tourney he overthrows and slays thirty opponents; then he goes roaming about the world; then he returns to his native land, and begins once more to play the bandit, robbing, burning, murdering, ravishing. One day, after cutting the throats of all the nuns of a certain abbey, he remembers his mother and goes in search of her. Soon as they spy him, the servants take to their heels, scattering in all directions; not one tarries to ask him whence he comes or what he desires. Then, for the first time in his life, Robert is astounded at the horror which he inspires in his fellow-beings; for the first time, he becomes conscious of his own monstrous wickedness, and he feels how his heart is pierced by the sharp tooth of remorse. But why is he wickeder than other men? Why was he born thus? Who made him what he is? An ardent longing seizes him to unravel this mystery. He hastens to his mother, and with drawn sword he adjures her to unveil to him the secret of his birth. Learning this, he becomes frantic with terror, shame, and grief. But his sturdy nature is not weakened; he does not yield to despair; instead, the hope of a laborious redemption, of a marvelous victory, urges and spurs on his proud spirit. He will learn to conquer Hell, to subdue himself, to thwart the designs of that accursed fiend who created him to serve his own ends, who has made of him a docile instrument of destruction and of sin. And he makes no delay. He goes to Rome, casts himself at the feet of the pope, makes confession to a holy hermit, submits himself to the harshest kind of penance, and swears that henceforth he will taste no food that he has not first wrested from the jaws of a dog. On two separate occasions, when Rome was besieged by the Saracens, he fights incognito for the Emperor and gains the victory for the Christians. Recognized at last, he refuses all rewards and honors, the imperial crown, even the monarch&#x27;s own daughter, goes away to dwell with his hermit in the wilderness, and dies a saint, blessed by both God and men. In other accounts, he finally weds the beautiful princess who is deeply in love with him.

===Literary history===

The oldest-known account of this legend is a Latin prose narrative by a Dominican friar, Etienne de Bourbon ( 1250), in which no information on Robert&#x27;s family is given. Then it appears in a French metrical romance of the 13th century, in which Robert is described as the son of the duchess of Normandy. An English translation by Samuel N. Rosenberg of the 13th-century French romance was published in 2018 by Penn State University Press. It appears also in a &quot;dit&quot; of somewhat later date, and in a miracle play of the 14th century. A French prose version was also prefixed to the old &quot;Croniques de Normandie&quot; (probably of the 13th century). But the legend owes its popularity to the story-books, of which the earliest known appeared at Lyons in 1496, and again at Paris in 1497, under the title &quot;La Vie du terrible Robert le dyable&quot;. Since the 16th century the legend was often printed together with that of Richard sans Peur (Richard I, Duke of Normandy); it was published in completely recast form in 1769 under the title &quot;Histoire de Robert le Diable, duc de Normandie, et de Richard Sans Peur, son fils&quot;.

From France the legend spread to Spain, where it was very popular. In England, the subject was treated in the metrical romance, &quot;Sir Gowther&quot;, probably written around the end of the 14th century (though in this version the devil disguises himself as the mother&#x27;s husband). An English translation from the French chapbook was made by Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton&#x27;s assistant, and published without date under the title &quot;Robert deuyll&quot;. Another version, not based on the preceding, was written by Thomas Lodge in his book on &quot;Robin the Divell&quot;, in which Robert is the &quot;second Duke of Normandy&quot; (London, 1591). In the Netherlands, the romance of &quot;Robrecht den Duyvel&quot; was put on the index of forbidden books by the Bishop of Antwerp in 1621.

In Germany, the legend never attained much of a vogue; not until the 19th century did it pass into the &quot;Volksbücher&quot;, being introduced by Görres. It was treated in epic form by Victor von Strauß (1854), in dramatic form by Raupach (1835) and in comic travesty (after the 1831 Meyerbeer opera &quot;Robert le diable&quot;) by W. S. Gilbert in 1868.

The villain in Erich Kästner&#x27;s 1931 children&#x27;s story &quot;Pünktchen und Anton&quot;, a petty criminal and thief, is rather facetiously nicknamed &quot;Robert the Devil&quot;.

==Historicity==
Various attempts have been made to identify Robert with a historical individual, generally a Norman aristocrat of the 11th century. F. J. Furnivall, following earlier writers, argued that Robert I, Duke of Normandy was the source of the story, writing that, &quot;The original of Robert the Devil was Robert, father of William the Conqueror, and sixth Duke of Normandy. Part of the legends about him have been transferred to a different person, Robert, King of Sicily (and of Jerusalem), Duke of Apulia etc., who tried to make peace between Edward III and the French king, and whom Froissart and others tell us of.&quot;

Other scholars have dismissed this. Charles Homer Haskins says that it is nothing more than &quot;an unwarranted confusion with this hero, or rather villain, of romance and grand opera&quot;. Another Norman aristocrat, Robert of Bellême, has also been suggested as the original. According to William Hunt in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, various stories of his sadistic cruelty were circulated after his death. In Maine, &quot;his abiding works are pointed to as the works of Robert the Devil, a surname that has been transferred from him to the father of the Conqueror.&quot;

A Norman castle near Rouen, known as Château de Robert le Diable, is associated with the legend. The Elizabethan statesman Robert Cecil was called &quot;Robert the devil&quot; by his enemies, but this was with reference to the existing legend.

== Folkloristic analysis ==
Scholars (e.g., , , Laura Hibbard Loomis, Jack Zipes, , Maxime Chevalier (es), Francisco Vaz da Silva) have noted similarities between the medieval tale of &quot;Robert le Diable&quot; and two folktales classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as types ATU 314, &quot;Goldener&quot;, and ATU 502, &quot;The Wild Man as Helper&quot;, in their common second part: the hero leaves home and goes to work in a lowly position in another kingdom (usually, as a gardener); later, he rides into battle to save the kingdom from a foreign enemy, and is injured during a battle; his wound or bandaged injury is used to identify him.

<doc id="383350" wikidata="Q652000" url="?curid=383350" title="Bray, County Wicklow">
<text>Bray ( ) is a coastal town in north County Wicklow, Ireland. It is situated about south of Dublin city centre on the east coast, and parts of the town&#x27;s northern outskirts are in County Dublin. It has a population of 33,512 making it the tenth largest urban area within Ireland (at the 2022 census). Bray is home to Ardmore Studios, and some light industry is located in the town, with some business and retail parks on its southern periphery. Commuter links between Bray and Dublin are provided by rail, Dublin Bus and the M11 and M50 motorways. The town is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

Originally developed as a planned resort town in the 19th century, Bray&#x27;s popularity as a seaside resort was serviced by the Dublin and Kingstown Railway, which was extended to Bray in 1854. During the late 20th century, the town&#x27;s use as a resort declined when foreign travel became an option for holiday-makers. However, day-trippers continued to come to Bray during the summer months.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Bray&quot; is an anglicisation of the Irish , whose meaning is unclear. Liam Price suggested it may be an old name for the River Dargle or a tributary. In 1875 P. W. Joyce mistakenly ascribed the Irish name , an old word meaning &quot;hill&quot;, referring in this case to Bray Head. In a 1905 Gaelic League publication advocating use of Irish-language postal addresses, Seosamh Laoide coined the name &quot;Brí in Cualu&quot;, as part of his policy that &quot;If the name of the town [in Irish] be one word, the [ancient Gaelic] territory should be added to it in the genitive case&quot;. and remained in use in the mid 20th century despite having been refuted by Liam Price and Osborn Bergin. was adopted by statute in 1975.

==History==
During the medieval period of Irish history, Bray was situated on the southern border of the Pale, and the coastal district was governed directly by the English crown from Dublin Castle. Inland, the countryside was largely under the control of Gaelic Chieftains, such as the O&#x27;Toole and O&#x27;Byrne clans. Bray features on the 1598 map &quot;A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles&quot; by Abraham Ortelius as &quot;Brey&quot;. William Brabazon, 1st Earl of Meath purchased the Killruddery Estate in Bray in 1627 with the establishment of the Earl title.
The Dublin and Kingstown Railway, the first in Ireland, opened in 1834 and was extended as far as Bray in 1854. With the coming of the railway in the mid-19th century, the town grew to become a seaside resort. It was developed primarily by local entrepreneurs as a planned resort town, modelled on the seaside resorts of the English south-coast, specifically Brighton. Hotels and residential terraces were built in the vicinity of the seafront. Railway entrepreneur William Dargan developed Victorian Turkish baths, designed by architect and sculptor Richard Barter in a Moorish style at a cost of £10,000. They opened in 1859 and were demolished in 1980, though the baths closed long before that.

Bray was a popular destination from the 1860s onwards. While small amenities such as regattas, firework displays and band performances were plentiful in the town, Bray failed to secure the necessary capital to develop major attractions and sustain tourism, leading to its decline in the early 1900s. Pleasure piers such as the Palace Pier were a mainstay of resorts at that time. Despite repeated efforts, Bray never acquired such a pier and abandoned plans to build one in 1906. Additional planned amenities which were never built included a concert hall, a theatre, an exhibition centre, a marine aquarium, winter gardens and an electrified tramway along the seafront. It experienced a brief revival from British tourists in the years immediately after World War II. However, Bray&#x27;s popularity as a seaside resort declined significantly when foreign travel became an option for holiday-makers. Its proximity to Dublin still makes it a popular destination for day-trippers from the capital.

==Location==

The town is situated on the east coast to the south of County Dublin. Shankill, County Dublin lies to the north, and Greystones, County Wicklow to the south. The village of Enniskerry lies to the west of the town, at the foot of the Wicklow Mountains. People participate in such sports as sailing, rowing, and swimming. The beach and seafront promenade are used by residents and visitors. While Bray&#x27;s promenade and south beach is to a Blue Flag standard, the north beach has been impacted by erosion and leaching pollution since the closure and sale of a municipal landfill in the late 20th century.

The River Dargle which enters the sea at the north end of Bray rises from a source near Djouce, in the Wicklow Mountains. Bray Head is situated at the southern end of the Victorian Promenade with paths leading to the summit and along the sea cliffs. The rocks of Bray Head are a mixture of greywackes and quartzite. There is a large cross at the summit.

=== Climate ===
Bray has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), similar to most other towns in Ireland, with few extremes of temperature and abundant precipitation year round. However, Bray is relatively sheltered from the prevailing south-westerly winds by the Wicklow Mountains and receives around of rainfall per year. The sunniest months on average are May and June, while October is by far the wettest.

==Access==
===Rail===
A public transport network, both north into Dublin and south into County Wicklow and County Wexford, serves the town. Bray is on the Irish Rail DART Rail Network which stretches north to Malahide and Howth and south to Greystones. The town is also on the mainline InterCity and Commuter rail network which connects north to Connolly Station in Dublin city centre and further to Drogheda and Dundalk. To the south, the rail line goes through Arklow and Gorey before reaching Rosslare Europort. Bray&#x27;s railway station is named after Edward Daly, an executed leader of the 1916 Easter Rising. Bray Station was opened on 10 July 1854. The Dublin and South Eastern Railway had two lines out from Bray into Dublin, the coastal line (formerly known as the Kingstown and Bray branch line) and the Harcourt Street line. The latter was closed in 1958 but most of it has been reopened as part of the Luas Green Line, which is proposed for an extension to Bray.

===Road===
Bray lies along the M11 motorway corridor; an interchange at its northern side links with the M50 Dublin bypass.
Several bus companies pass through Bray: Dublin Bus, Go-Ahead Ireland, Bus Éireann, Aircoach, and St. Kevin&#x27;s Bus Service to Glendalough. Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland are the two primary bus operators in the town operating service on behalf of the NTA. Bus services serving the town include the E1 which is routed from Ballywaltrim, just south of Bray, to Northwood via UCD and Dublin city centre. Other routes include the 45A/B, 84N, 131, 181, 185t, 702, L1, L2, L12, L14, X1, and X2.

Wexford Bus also offer services to the village of Kilmacanogue, just to the south of Bray, with routes 740/A/X and UM11, and Bus Éireann route 133 from the same stop.

Finnegan Bray formerly offered two local town services (routes 143 and 144, which finished on the 24th of January 2025, becoming part of route L14) as well as a night bus service from Dublin (route 984N), however, this was suspended in March 2020 due to Covid restrictions. It was discontinued in late 2022, with the company blaming &quot;unfair competition from state subsidised services&quot; in a Facebook post.

===Air===
Dublin Airport is reachable via the M50, which passes to the west of Dublin City, and is served by Aircoach route 702 at Castle Street and Vevay Road, though this is scheduled to be removed on the 2nd of March 2025. Newcastle Aerodrome is the closest private airfield a short distance south of Bray.

==Demography==

Bray has a growing population of permanent residents.
==Local government==

Bray is represented on Wicklow County Council by two local electoral areas. Bray East (4 seats) is approximately two-thirds of the town, while Bray West (4 seats) is the other third and includes the neighbouring villages of Enniskerry and Kilmacanogue. The electoral divisions of Bray East are Bray No. 1 Urban, Bray No. 2 Urban, Bray No. 3 Urban and Rathmichael (Bray). The electoral divisions of Bray West are Enniskerry, Kilmacanoge and Powerscourt. Bray Municipal District consists of both of these local electoral areas.

The Bray Town Commissioners were established by a local act in 1866. The Earl of Meath was named in the act as the first chairman of the commissioners. In 1899, this body became an urban district council under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. At the same time, a portion of the town which had been in County Dublin was transferred to County Wicklow and the jurisdiction of the urban district. The boundary of the town was further extended in 1952 (taking in the area around Killruddery), in 1958 (taking in the area in Rathmichael which had been transferred the previous year from County Dublin to County Wicklow), and in 1978 (extending the town to the west).

The urban district council became a town council in 2002. It was abolished by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, with the powers and functions of the town council given to the county council, but its functions could be administered by the new municipal district council created by the act.

Part of the northern Bray area lies within the local authority area of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, and forms part of the Shankill–Killiney local electoral area. The border between County Wicklow and County Dublin (Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown) lies along Old Connaught Avenue and runs down along and across the Dublin Road to Ravenswell, making all areas north of that line Bray, County Dublin.

==Tourism==

Bray is a long-established holiday resort dating back to the early 19th century. The Parliamentary gazetteer of 1846 described it thusly:

The town has for many years been a favourite summer resort of the wealthier of the Dublin citizens and of the gentry from a large part of Ireland; and it possesses, in a state of high facility and polish, the various appliances required for their accommodation and comfort, whether as lodgers or as tourists. Handsome cottages ornees, boarding houses on different scales of economy, and furnished houses from the small abode to the luxurious mansion, abound both in the town and in its environs, for the special use of visitors. 
Bray has numerous hotels and guesthouses, shops, restaurants and evening entertainment. The town also hosts a number of festival events. In the town&#x27;s vicinity are an 18-hole golf courses, a tennis club, fishing, a sailing club and horse riding. Other features of Bray are the amusement arcades and the National Sealife Centre. It has a beach of sand and shingle which is over long, fronted by an esplanade and Bray Head, which rises from the coast, has views of mountains and sea. The concrete cross at the top of Bray head was erected in 1950 for the holy year.

Bray is used as a base for walkers, and has a promenade which stretches from the harbour, with its colony of mute swans, to the base of Bray Head at the southern end. A track leads to the summit. Also used by walkers is the Cliff Walk along Bray Head out to Greystones.

In January 2010, Bray was named the &quot;cleanest town in Ireland&quot; in the 2009 Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL) survey of 60 towns and cities.

===Tourist sites===
Tourist sites in the area include the Elizabethan-revival mansion Killruddery House (which is open to the public in the summer months), and the hill and headland at Bray Head (which has a number of walking trails). Raheen-a-Cluig, a medieval church which is catalogued as national monument, is located on the north face of Bray Head. Other religious sites and churches in the area include the Fassaroe Cross (12th century), the Holy Redeemer Church, Bray (1792), and the Gothic Revival churches of Christ Church (1863) and Bray Methodist Church (1864).

===Festivals and events===

The Bray St. Patrick&#x27;s Carnival and Parade is presented by Bray and District Chamber to celebrate Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day.

Bray also hosts a yearly silent film festival, the Killruddery Film Festival in Killruddery Gardens. Bray Jazz Festival takes place annually on the May bank holiday weekend and includes performances by jazz and world music artists.

The annual Bray Summerfest takes place over six weeks in July and August and includes free entertainment, live music, markets, sporting events, and carnivals. Performers who have headlined include Mundy, Brian Kennedy, the Undertones, the Hothouse Flowers and Mary Black.

A short-lived greyhound racing track existed in the town from 1949 until 1955, run by the Bray Greyhound Racing Association Ltd. In December 1947, notice was given that a track would be constructed at Sunnybank but the Wicklow County Manager refused the application. However, the greyhound company continued to build the facilities and in 1949 the track opened. It was not until 1950 that the High Court ruled against the company for building without planning permission and levied a fine of £470. The dispute continued until, in 1955, the track was bought by Bray Urban Council under a compulsory purchase order. The site, consisting of almost five acres, was bought at £440 per acre, and 36 houses were built on the land.

Thousands of people turned out on the seafront to see Olympic boxing champion Katie Taylor, return home from London in August 2012.

<text>U Sports (stylized as U SPORTS) is the national sport governing body for universities in Canada, comprising the majority of degree-granting universities in the country and four regional conferences: Ontario University Athletics (OUA), Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec (RSEQ), Canada West (CW), and Atlantic University Sport (AUS). The equivalent body for organized sports at colleges in Canada is the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA). Some institutions are members of both bodies for different sports.

== History ==

=== Formation, CIAU, CIS ===
The original Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union (CIAU) was founded in 1906 and existed until 1955, composed only of universities from Ontario and Quebec. The semi-national organization, CIAU Central, provided common rules and regulations.

A growth spurt between 1944–55 saw the CIAU Central grow into a large group of nineteen (19) member universities each of which had diverse enrollment, philosophy, and practices both academically and athletically. The result saw the collapse of CIAU Central as there was no forum to evaluate or research policy in order to adjudicate conflicts within the organization

At the same time women&#x27;s programs were expanding and required organization. In 1923, the Women&#x27;s Intercollegiate Athletic Union (WIAU) was founded to provide athletic competition for female students in Ontario and the Ontario-Quebec Women&#x27;s Intercollegiate Athletics (O-QWICA) coordinated programs for female students in Ontario and Quebec.

With the collapse of the CIAU Central in the mid-1950s, calls for a new, national governing body for university sport accelerated. Once the Royal Military College of Canada became a degree granting institution, Major W. J. (Danny) McLeod, athletic director at the RMC directed the establishment of the Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union (CIAU) in 1961. 

With financial assistance from the federal government, universities committed themselves to excellence in their sports programs, increased their schedules, and assigned coaches to year round programs to assist the federal government in identifying talent, national training centers, provision of facilities, sport research, and testing, all with an eye on developing international competitors. 

Major McLeod ran the CIAU from his office at RMC as the first CIAU Secretary-Treasurer. In the 1960s the CIAU functioned as a voluntary, autonomous, educational sport organization which represented by the various universities from coast to coast. 

In 1978, the Canadian Women&#x27;s Interuniversity Athletic Union (CWIAU), which had formed in 1970, merged with the CIAU; the expanded CIAU reinforced its university focus by adjusting its name to the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union.

In June 2001, the membership of the CIAU voted to change the name and logo of the organization to Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS).

=== Rebrand and new approach ===
On October 20, 2016, CIS announced that it would be changing its name to U Sports, accompanied by a new logo and approach to Canadian University sports. The name was chosen in part to better represent Canada as a bilingual nation with a united name as opposed to separate acronyms. The new name and look were also intended to increase the marketability of Canadian University sports.

== Athletic funding &amp; eligibility ==
The U Sports member institutions offer athletic scholarships known as Athletic Financial Awards (AFA); subject to minimum academic requirements. The AFA&#x27;s are capped and may not exceed the value of the tuition and compulsory fees for the student-athlete. Universities also may provide additional non-athletic awards including academic scholarships and needs-based grants for athletes in addition to this cap, provided the additional awards do not include athletic criteria. In 2008-09 one in two U Sports athletes was receiving an athletic scholarship.

Increasingly, U Sports schools are offering booster-support programs, where alumni, parents and/or corporations can donate money to a targeted fund especially designed to off-set a student-athlete&#x27;s tuition and living costs. The University of Windsor has an &quot;Adopt-A-Lancer&quot; program, for example. U Sports has no regulations regarding how much each school can provide to teams through private support. The Université Laval&#x27;s Rouge et Or football team, winner of seven of the last 12 Vanier Cups, is so successful with fund raising that the team trains in Florida during the spring.

Canadian Hockey League teams offer financial support for their graduates – who attend school within two years of playing major junior – who choose to play for a U Sports school after graduating from major junior hockey based on a model where the league will give scholarships commensurate with the seasons they played in the CHL. 

Beginning with the 2024–25 season, students will be able to receive athletic scholarships regardless of the grades they receive in their final year of high school or CEGEP. U Sports institutions will also be required to give a minimum of 45 per cent of their total athletic scholarship units to athletes on men&#x27;s teams and a minimum of 45 per cent to athletes on women&#x27;s teams.

== Sponsored sports ==
Sports sanctioned include the following: basketball, cross country, curling, field hockey (women), football (men), ice hockey, rugby union (women), soccer, swimming, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling.

=== Men&#x27;s team sports ===
=== Men&#x27;s individual sports ===
=== Women&#x27;s team sports ===
=== Women&#x27;s individual sports ===
== National championships ==
U Sports hosts national championships for the following sports:
== Conferences and members ==
There are 58 member universities in U Sports. These 58 member universities are currently organized into the four following regional associations. In some of these sports, these associations are sometimes referred to as conferences. These conferences also organize regional championships.

<doc id="383360" wikidata="Q27074616" url="?curid=383360" title="Spotted shag">
<text>The spotted shag or pārekareka (Phalacrocorax punctatus) is a species of cormorant endemic to New Zealand. Though originally classified as &quot;Phalacrocorax punctatus&quot;, it is sufficiently different in appearance from typical members of that genus that for a time it was placed in a separate genus, &quot;Stictocarbo&quot;, along with a similar species, the Pitt shag. Subsequent genetic studies show that the spotted shag&#x27;s lineage is nested within the typical shags.

==Taxonomy==
The spotted shag was initially called the ‘crested shag’ by Johann Forster. He shot the bird while out hunting with the famous James Cook. Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman was Forster&#x27;s assistant on this second voyage of James Cook, and he described the spotted shag in 1786 as &quot;Pelicanus punctatus&quot;. Bonaparte erected the separate genus &quot;Stictocarbo&quot; for it in 1855. It was later returned to its original genus.

In 1930, the Stewart Island population was described as a separate species, the blue shag (&quot;Stictocarbo steadi&quot;), distinguished by its narrow rather than broad white stripe on its head and neck.

A 2014 molecular study by Kennedy and Spencer found that the spotted shag belongs to a clade of Old World cormorants. Its closest relative is the Pitt shag (&quot;P. featherstoni&quot;), and their common ancestor split from a lineage giving rise to the black-faced, pied and little black cormorants of Australia.

==Description==
The spotted shag is a medium-sized marine bird. They are usually between high and weigh between . Their bodies are very slim and they have a very distinctive black, decurved, double crest growing on their nape and their forehead. They have a long, slender, orange-brown coloured, hooked bill and yellow-orange feet. The feathers on their bodies are grey and blue. The adults have small black spots on their backs and wings, which gave them their name. Their irises are brown, while the ring around the iris is blue. They have a small patch of bare facial skin between their eyes and bill, which turns green-blue just before breeding season. Furthermore, non-breeding adults do not have crests and have paler underparts. The males and females do look very alike, there is almost no sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism means that the males and females of a species look different and can be easily told apart, which is not the case for the spotted shag. However, the males and females can be told apart by their calls and mating behavior. Normally they do not produce much noise, only when they are at resting, roosting and nesting areas. When they produce sounds, it can be heard as loud grunts. Spotted shags usually fly in V-formation and it is hard to tell males and female apart. In flight, they look slender and pale, while their rump and tail look darker.
It is hard to estimate the total number of spotted shags in New Zealand; estimates are between 10,000 and 50,000 breeding pairs (20,000 to 100,000 birds). In the past, the number of spotted shags has been limited by the availability of food, which caused an increase in number during the late 1980s.

==Distribution and habitat==

The spotted shag is endemic to New Zealand. It breeds only on the coastlines of New Zealand and some of the offshore islands, being mainly found on the South Island. High numbers can be found on the west coast and near Stewart Island, but they also inhabit some places on the North Island. During breeding, they can mostly be found on their breeding sites, but otherwise they are more dispersed to other coastal areas. Large colonies can be found around Banks Peninsula near Christchurch, and in a rocky outcrop named the &#x27;Shag Rock&#x27; in Wellington Harbour. Phalacrocorax punctatus are locally common, with estimates of numbers nationwide varying from 10,000 to 50,000 pairs.

This species prefers to nest on cliffs along rocky coasts where they occupy ledges or cracks, forming colonies of over a thousand birds. They seldom go into freshwater environments or enclosed estuaries (Heather &amp; Robertson, 2000). Seaweed is often used in lining the nests, the foundation of which is made of sticks.

==Breeding==

The spotted shag lays one to four (usually three) blue eggs with chalky covering, with both parents continuously guarding the chicks for about 30 days. Chicks do not leave the nest until they are at least 52 days old. They may breed all year round. When the spotted shag hatches, it is completely blind, naked and weak and has very poor coordination. They will beg their parents for food, but are not able to direct it. Between day 4 and 6, their eyes start to open and between day 7 and 11 their begging starts to become more directed towards the parent. They also become a lot stronger and they start calling loudly. Down starts to cover their body and is becoming thicker between day 12 and 17. Then, they also become more active and start flapping their wings. Between day 18 and 23, the chicks start to move more rapidly, though clumsily. By this time, the tail feathers have grown to about 1 cm. Between day 24 and 30, the spotted contour feathers are developing on the top surface of their wings. Some chicks start to leave the nests. Between day 30 and 35, the birds have almost reached adult size, but the down is still covering their bodies. The contour feathers will appear between day 35 and 40 and will be complete between day 40 and 50. By this time, the tail is also fully grown and many birds will have left the nests to form small groups. Later in life, they will form monogamous breeding pairs. Breeding colonies can sometimes consist of even 700 pairs. These pairs lay 3 to 4 blue eggs and the tasks of incubation and the rearing of the chicks are shared. Both parents feed the young by the ordinary manner in the nest. The fast flight of spotted shags up to a cliff-side perch makes its approach to nest spectacular. After breeding, most spotted shags remain within 200 kilometres of their breeding grounds. They form large winter flocks of up to 2000 birds, often flying in long lines between their feeding and roosting areas.

It is common to find red-billed gull hanging around the spotted shag colony. Also, it is easy to find that the gulls’ nesting colony are built nearby. The fact is that after the young spotted shag have been fed, parents have to leave nests to find more food to raise their young shags. At this moment, gulls forthwith fly to the nest and standing on the edge of it, their whole manner and tone of voice convey the impression of swearing. The young immediately disgorge some of their food, which the gull promptly eats.

==Diet and foraging==

Spotted shags are able to feed up to 16 km offshore. Their main diet consists of small fish and marine invertebrates, but they barely affect the New Zealand fish stock. The birds catch fish by diving from the sea surface and propelling themselves underwater with their webbed feet. They dive for an average of about 30 seconds, usually resting on the surface for 10 to 15 seconds between dives. The longest dive ever recorded was 70 seconds. Spotted shags often carry some small stones in their gizzard, which might function as to grind food or to avoid unwanted gut parasites. Sometimes they may be seen fishing singly, but more often a number are seen together, fishing by long dives or following a shoal.

==Predators, parasites and disease==

Some birds are accidentally caught by fishing nets and drown. Spotted shags might be affected by the lice species &quot;Eidmanniella pellucida&quot; (Rudow, 1869) and &quot;Pectinopygus punctatus&quot; (Timmermann, 1964) (Pilgrim &amp; Palma, 1982). Furthermore, they might be affected by the following tick species: &quot;Carios capensis&quot; (Neumann, 1901), &quot;Ixodes eudyptidis&quot; (Maskell, 1885), &quot;Ixodes jacksoni&quot; (Hoogstraal, 1967) that only appears on the spotted shag and &quot;Ixodes uriae&quot; (White, 1852) (Heath et al., 2011). They also might carry the flea species &quot;Parapsyllus longicornis&quot; (Enderlein, 1901) (Part &amp; Part, 1990). The spotted shag does not appear to be subject to significant predation and disease. A parasite that may affect it is &quot;Contracaecum spiculigerum, Eustrongylides sp&quot;.

==Conservation status==
The species is considered to be not threatened. However, although the species used to be prevalent in the Hauraki Gulf, their populations have undergone a significant decline in the last century. DNA analysis has recently indicated that the birds originating from the northern parts of New Zealand are genetically distinct thus increasing the concern over the continuing decline of the species in and around Auckland.

==In culture==
In 1988, New Zealand released a series of postage stamps devoted to the native birds of the country. The spotted shag was featured on the 60-cent stamp.

<text>Bassline (also known as a bass line or bass part) is the term used in many styles of music, such as blues, jazz, funk, dub and electronic, traditional, and classical music, for the low-pitched instrumental part or line played (in jazz and some forms of popular music) by a rhythm section instrument such as the electric bass, double bass, cello, tuba or keyboard (piano, Hammond organ, electric organ, or synthesizer).

In unaccompanied solo performance, basslines may simply be played in the lower register of any instrument while melody and/or further accompaniment is provided in the middle or upper register. In solo music for piano and pipe organ, these instruments have an excellent lower register that can be used to play a deep bassline. On organs, the bass line is typically played using the pedal keyboard and massive 16&#x27; and 32&#x27; bass pipes.

==Riffs and grooves==
Basslines in popular music often use &quot;riffs&quot; or &quot;grooves&quot;, which are usually simple, appealing musical motifs or phrases that are repeated, with variation, throughout the song. &quot;The bass differs from other voices because of the particular role it plays in supporting and defining harmonic motion. It does so at levels ranging from immediate, chord-by-chord events to the larger harmonic organization of entire work.&quot; 

Bassline riffs usually (but not always) emphasize the chord tones of each chord (usually the root note, the third note, or the fifth note), which helps to define a song&#x27;s key. Basslines align or syncopate with the drums. Other rhythm instruments join in to create a more interesting rhythmic variations.
The type of rhythmic pulse used in basslines varies widely in different types of music. In swing jazz and jump blues, basslines are often created from a continuous sequence of quarter notes in a mostly scalar, stepwise or arpeggio-based part called a &quot;walking bass line&quot;. In Latin, salsa music, jazz fusion, reggae, electronica, and some types of rock and metal, basslines may be very rhythmically complex and syncopated. In bluegrass and traditional country music, basslines often emphasize the root and fifth of each chord. 

Though basslines may be played by many different types of instruments and in a broad musical range, they are generally played on bass instruments and in the range roughly at least an octave and a half below middle C (roughly the range of the bass clef). In classical music such as string quartets and symphonies, basslines play the same harmonic and rhythmic role; however, they are usually referred to as the &quot;bass voice&quot; or the &quot;bass part&quot;.

==Instruments==
Most popular musical ensembles include an instrument capable of playing bass notes. In the 1890s, a tuba was often used. From the 1920s to the 1940s, most popular music groups used the double bass as the bass instrument. Starting in the 1950s, the bass guitar began to replace the double bass in most types of popular music, such as rock and roll, blues, and folk. The bass guitar was easier to transport and, given that it uses magnetic pickups, easier to amplify to loud stage volumes without the risk of audio feedback, a common problem with the amplified double bass. By the 1970s and 1980s, the electric bass was used in most rock bands and jazz fusion groups. The double bass was still used in some types of popular music that recreated styles from the 1940s and 1950s such as jazz (especially swing and bebop), traditional 1950s blues, jump blues, country, and rockabilly.

In some popular music bands, keyboard instruments are used to play the bass line. In organ trios, for example, a Hammond organ player performs the basslines using the organ&#x27;s pedal keyboard. In some types of popular music, such as hip-hop or house music, the bass lines are played using bass synthesizers, sequencers, or electro-acoustically modeled samples of basslines.
Basslines are important in many forms of dance and electronic music, such as electro, drum and bass, dubstep, and most forms of house and trance. In these genres, basslines are almost always performed on synthesizers, either physical, such as the Minimoog and the Roland TB-303, or virtual, such as Sytrus and ZynAddSubFX. In hip-hop, producer Rick Rubin popularized the technique of creating basslines by lengthening the bass drum decay of the TR-808 drum machine and tuning it to different pitches.

Chinese orchestras use the zhōng ruǎn (中阮) and dà ruǎn (大阮) for creating basslines. Other, less common bass instruments are the lā ruǎn (拉阮), dī yīn gé hú (低音革胡), and da dī hú (大低胡) developed during the 1930s. Russian balalaika orchestra use bass balalaika and contrabass balalaika.

Australia&#x27;s indigenous music and some World music that is influenced by Australian music uses didjeridus for basslines.

===Classical music===
In classical music, the bassline is always written out for the performers in musical notation. In orchestral repertoire, the basslines are played by the double basses and cellos in the string section, by bassoons, contrabassoons, and bass clarinets in the woodwinds and by bass trombones, tubas and a variety of other low brass instruments. In symphonies from the Classical period, a single bassline was often written for the cellos and basses; however, since the bass is a transposing instrument, and it is notated an octave higher than it sounds, when cellos and basses play the same bassline, the line is performed in octaves, with the basses an octave below the cellos. By the end of the Classical period, with Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies, cellos and double basses were often given separate parts. In general, the more complex passages and rapid note sequences are given to the cellos, while the basses play a simpler bassline. The timpani (or kettledrums) also play a role in orchestral basslines, albeit confined in 17th and early 18th century works to a few notes, often the tonic and the dominant below it. In a small number of symphonies, the pipe organ is used to play basslines.

In chamber music, the bassline is played by the cello in string quartets and the bassoon in wind chamber music. In some larger chamber music works, both a cello and a double bass are used to play the bassline. In a Baroque era (–1750) piece accompanied by basso continuo, the accompanying musicians would include a chordal instrument (e.g., harpsichord, pipe organ or lute) and a number of bass instruments might perform the same bassline, such as the cello, viol, double bass, theorbo, serpent (an early wind instrument), and, if an organist was present, the lower manual of the organ and the low-pitched pedal keyboard. In 2000s-era performances of Baroque music, the basso continuo is typically performed by just two instruments: a chordal instrument and one bass instrument (often harpsichord and cello).

===Popular music===

In many genres of modern traditional music (ranging from folk rock to blues) and popular music (ranging from rock and pop to reggae to funk), the bassline is generally played by an electric bass player. In rockabilly, psychobilly, traditional blues and bluegrass music, the bassline is played by a double bass player. The bassline uses low notes that provide a rhythm while simultaneously setting out the foundation of the chord progression. The bassline bridges the gap between the rhythmic part played by the drummer and the melodic lines played by the lead guitarist and the chordal parts played by the rhythm guitarist and/or keyboard player. In most traditional and popular music styles, the bass player is expected to be able to improvise a bassline which they base in the chord progression of a song. When a bassist is playing a cover song, they may play the bassline that was originally used on the recording. A session bassist playing in a music studio is expected to be able to read a bassline written in musical notation. Bass players also perform fills in between the phrases of the vocal melody, and they may also perform bass runs or bass breaks, which are short solo sections. Rhythmic variations by the bass, such as the introduction of a syncopated figure can dramatically change the feel of a song, even for a simple groove.

&quot;In any style, the bass&#x27;s role in the groove is the same: to keep time and to outline the tonality. When developing bass lines, these two things should always be your goal&quot;

==Walking bass==

A walking bass is a style of bass accompaniment or line, common in Baroque music (1600–1750) and 20th century jazz, blues and rockabilly, which creates a feeling of regular quarter note movement, akin to the regular alternation of feet while walking. Walking basslines generally consist of unsyncopated notes of equal value, usually quarter notes (known in jazz as a &quot;four feel&quot;). Walking basslines use a mixture of scale tones, arpeggios, chromatic runs, and passing tones to outline the chord progression of a song or tune, often with a melodic shape that alternately rises and falls in pitch over several bars. To add variety to a walking bassline, bassists periodically interpolate various fills, such as playing scale or arpeggio fragments in swung eighth notes, plucking muted percussive grace notes (either one grace note or a &quot;raked&quot; sequence of two or three grace notes), or holding notes for two, three, or four beats. Some songs lend themselves to another type of variation: the pedal point, in which the bassist holds or repeats a single note (often the tonic or the dominant) under the chord changes.

Walking basslines are usually performed on the double bass or the electric bass, but they can also be performed using the low register of a piano, Hammond organ, tuba or other instruments. They can also be sung, as is done by some a capella vocal groups. While walking bass lines are most commonly associated with jazz and blues, they are also used in rock, rockabilly, ska, R&amp;B, gospel, Latin, country, and many other genres.

=== Examples ===
Walking bass in the pedal keyboard part of Baroque organ music (J.S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland&quot;, BWV 659, from the Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes):


Other walking bass lines can be heard in the opening movements of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 22 (nicknamed &quot;The Philosopher&quot;), Anton Bruckner&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 and Edward Elgar&#x27;s Symphony No. 1.

Walking bass often alternates quarter notes:

&lt;score&gt;\relative c&#x27; \repeat volta 2{ c g c g c g b a g d&#x27; g, d&#x27; g, d&#x27; e d}&lt;/score&gt;

giving rise to the term.

Many boogie-woogie basslines are walking bass lines:
: or 

Walking bass often moves in stepwise (scalar) motion to successive chord roots, such as often in country music:


In this example, the last two quarter notes of the second measure, D and E, &quot;walk&quot; up from the first quarter note in that measure, C, to the first note of the third measure, F (C and F are the roots of the chords in the first through second and third through fourth measures, respectively).

In both cases, &quot;walking&quot; refers both to the steady duple rhythm (one step after the other) and to the strong directional motion created; in the examples above, from C to F and back in the second, and from root to seventh and back in the first.

In bebop jazz, the walking bass has a stabilising effect, offsetting and providing a foil to the complexity of the improvised melodic lines, for example in Sonny Rollins’ “Blue Seven”.

==Bass run==

A bass run (or &quot;bass break&quot;) is a short instrumental break or fill in which the bass instrument (such as an electric bass or a double bass) or instruments (in the case of a marching band) and the bassline are given the forefront. The bass part for a bass run often differs from the usual bass accompaniment style, in terms of the register, timbre, or melodic style that is used, or the number of notes per beat which are played.

A bass run may be composed by the performer or by an arranger prior to a performance, or it may be improvised onstage by the performer using scales, arpeggios, and standard licks and riffs. In some cases, a bass run may incorporate a display of virtuoso techniques such as rapid passages or high notes. During a bass run, the main vocal or melody line usually stops, and in some cases, the percussion or drums may also stop. The technique originated in the marches of the &quot;Sousa school&quot;, though its resemblance to call and response techniques familiar to African American musicians indicates an earlier origin.

===Electric bass===

In a rock song in which the bassline consists of low-pitched quarter notes played on the electric bass, a bass run may consist of a rapid sequence of sixteenth notes in a higher register, or of a melodic riff played in a higher register. In some cases, the bassist will select a &quot;brighter&quot;-sounding pickup or increase the treble response of the instrument for a bass run, so that it will be easier to hear.

In a heavy metal song where the bassist was ordinarily playing low notes without overdrive to accompany, for a solo, they may turn on a fuzz bass pedal and use a wah pedal to create a more pronounced tone (an approach used by Cliff Burton), and then play an upper register riff or scale run. Some shred guitar-style bassists may do two-handed tapping during a bass solo (e.g., Billy Sheehan).

In a pop song in which the bassline consists of notes plucked on the electric bass, a bass run may consist of several bars of percussive slapping and popping. Bass solos and guitar solos are rare in pop. In the rare cases that instrumental solos occur in pop, they are often played by synthesizer or, in some bands, by saxophone.

In a EDM, house, dubstep, grime, and related genres, synthesiser bass is used (along with kickdrums).

In a funk song in which the bassline already consists of percussive slapping and popping, a bass run may consist of a virtuosic display of rapid slapping and popping techniques combined with techniques such as glissando, note-bending, and harmonics.

===Double bass===

In a jump blues tune in which the bassline consists of low-pitched quarter notes played on the double bass in a scalar walking bass style, a bass run may consist of a bar of swung eighth notes played using a percussive slap bass style, in which the right hand strikes the strings against the fingerboard.

In a swing tune in which the bassline consists of low-pitched quarter notes played on the double bass in a scalar walking bass style, a bass run may consist of a descending chromatic scale played in a higher register.

In a bluegrass tune in which the bassline consists of low-pitched quarter notes played on the double bass on the root and fifth of each chord on beats one and three (of a 4/4 tune), a bass run may consist of a walking bass line played for several bars.

In a psychobilly band, a bass solo will often consist of a virtuosic display of triple and quadruple slaps, creating a percussive, drum solo-like sound.

===Wind bass===
In a marching band, a bass run may consist of a several bar unaccompanied passage composed for the tubas and sousaphones which displays either rapid passages of notes or higher-register techniques. In New Orleans jazz, the tuba may provide a walking bass line similar to that of the double bass.

<text>USS &quot;Chicago&quot; (CL/CA-29) was a of the United States Navy that served in the Pacific Theater in the early years of World War II. She was the second US Navy ship to be named after the city of Chicago. After surviving a midget submarine attack at Sydney Harbour and serving in battle at the Coral Sea and Savo Island in 1942, she was sunk by Japanese aerial torpedoes in the Battle of Rennell Island, in the Solomon Islands, on 30 January 1943.

==Construction==
&quot;Chicago&quot; was launched on 10 April 1930 by Mare Island Naval Shipyard under the supervision of Naval constructor Charles W. Fisher Jr., sponsored by Miss E. Britten; and commissioned on 9 March 1931, Captain Manley H. Simons in command. She was originally classified as a light cruiser, CL-29, because of her thin armor. From 1 July 1931, &quot;Chicago&quot; was redesignated a heavy cruiser, CA-29, because of her 8-inch guns in accordance with the provisions of the London Naval Treaty of 1930.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
After a shakedown cruise to Honolulu, Tahiti and American Samoa, &quot;Chicago&quot; departed Mare Island on 27 July 1931 and sailed to the east coast, arriving at Fort Pond Bay, New York, on 16 August. There, she became flagship of Commander, Cruisers, Scouting Force, and operated with that force until 1940.

In February 1932, &quot;Chicago&quot; conducted gunnery exercises with other ships of the Scouting Force preliminary to Fleet Problem XIII off the California coast. The fleet was based on the West Coast thereafter and, until 1934, operated in the Pacific, from Alaska to the Panama Canal Zone and the Hawaiian Islands.
On 24 October 1933, &quot;Chicago&quot; collided with the British freighter &quot;Silver Palm&quot; in dense fog off Point Sur, California. Three officers aboard &quot;Chicago&quot; were killed in their quarters during the collision, and an enlisted man&#x27;s arm had to be amputated as well. &quot;Silver Palm&quot; penetrated around into the cruiser&#x27;s port bow, forward of the Number 1 gun mount. At the time of the incident damage was estimated to be around $200,000 ($ today). The vessel was repaired at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, departing there on 24 March 1934.

In 1934, the annual fleet exercises were held in the Caribbean, followed in May 1934 by the Presidential Fleet Review in New York Harbor. The Scouting Force operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean until October and then returned to base at San Pedro, California. &quot;Chicago&quot; was one of six ships to receive the new RCA CXAM radar in 1940. &quot;Chicago&quot; continued to operate out of San Pedro until 29 September 1940, when she sailed to Pearl Harbor.

During the next 14 months, &quot;Chicago&quot; operated out of Pearl Harbor, exercising with various task forces to develop tactics and cruising formations, and cruising to Australia and to the west coast.
===World War II===
When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, &quot;Chicago&quot; was at sea with Task Force 12 and the Force immediately began a five-day sweep in the Oahu-Johnston-Palmyra triangle in an effort to intercept the enemy. The Force returned to Pearl Harbor on 12 December; from 14–27 December, &quot;Chicago&quot; operated with Task Force 11 on patrol and search missions.

On 2 February 1942, &quot;Chicago&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for Suva, where she joined the newly formed ANZAC Squadron, later redesignated as Task Force 44. During March and April, the cruiser operated off the Louisiade Archipelago, covering the attacks on Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea. In a position to intercept enemy surface units which attempted to attack Port Moresby, &quot;Chicago&quot; also provided cover for the arrival of American troops on New Caledonia.

On 1 May, &quot;Chicago&quot; was ordered from Nouméa to join Commander, Southwest Pacific, and on the 4th she supported in her strike against the Japanese on Tulagi, Solomon Islands during the Battle of the Coral Sea. On 7 May, she proceeded, with the Support Group, to intercept and attack the Japanese Port Moresby invasion group. The following day, the group underwent several Japanese air attacks, during which &quot;Chicago&quot; suffered several casualties from strafing, but drove off the planes and proceeded ahead until it was clear that the Japanese force had been turned back.
On the night of 31 May – 1 June, while in port in Sydney Harbour, Australia, &quot;Chicago&quot; fired on an attacking Japanese midget submarine. &quot;Chicago&quot;″s captain, Howard D. Bode, was ashore when his ship opened fire. After coming back aboard on his ship, he initially accused all the officers of being drunk. Shortly afterwards, the presence of the submarine was confirmed. Three Japanese midget submarines had attacked Sydney Harbour. One became entangled in an anti-submarine boom net, and two were able to pass through. One was then disabled by depth charges, but the other managed to fire two torpedoes at &quot;Chicago.&quot; One torpedo passed near &quot;Chicago&quot; and destroyed the converted ferry , nearby, killing 21 sailors, while the second torpedo failed to detonate, and skidded ashore onto Garden Island.

During June and July 1942, &quot;Chicago&quot; continued to operate in the Southwest Pacific. From 7–9 August, she supported the initial landings on Guadalcanal and others of the Solomon Islands, beginning the second US counter-offensive after New Guinea against Japan. On 9 August, she engaged in the Battle of Savo Island. Early in the engagement a hit from a Japanese destroyer&#x27;s torpedo caused significant damage to the ship&#x27;s bow. &quot;Chicago&quot; fought damage while continuing to engage until contact with the enemy was lost. Capt. Bode&#x27;s actions during the engagement were questioned in an inquiry headed by Admiral Arthur Japy Hepburn. Though the report was not intended to be made public, Bode learned of its findings and shot himself on 19 April 1943, dying the next day.

After Savo Island, &quot;Chicago&quot; was repaired at Nouméa, Sydney, and San Francisco, where she arrived 13 October.

===Loss at the Battle of Rennell Island===


Early in January 1943, &quot;Chicago&quot; departed San Francisco, action-bound once more. On 27 January, she sailed from Nouméa to escort a Guadalcanal convoy. On the night of the 29th, as the ships approached that bitterly contested island, Japanese aircraft attacked the force and the Battle of Rennell Island was underway. During the attacks, two burning Japanese planes silhouetted &quot;Chicago&quot;, providing enough light for further torpedo attacks; two hits caused severe flooding and loss of power. By the time the attack ended, work by the crew had checked &quot;Chicago&#x27;s&quot; list. took the disabled ship in tow, and was relieved by the following morning. Fighters from the nearby carrier &quot;Enterprise &quot; provided CAP for the wounded cruiser as she tried to make her way away from the battle area. During the afternoon, the Japanese attacked again with 20 G4M “Betty” bombers. The ship was hit by four torpedoes, one forward of the bridge and three others in her engineering spaces. The patrolling fighters downed 8 of the attacking planes, but the damage was done. Captain Ralph O. Davis gave the order to abandon ship shortly before &quot;Chicago&quot; sank stern first, 20 minutes later at . &quot;Navajo&quot; and the escorting destroyers rescued 1,049 survivors from &quot;Chicago&quot;, but 62 of her crew died. A final attack force of Japanese torpedo bombers failed to find the remaining U.S. ships.

The Japanese widely publicized the results of the engagement, claiming to have sunk two battleships and three cruisers. In reality they sank only the heavy cruiser &quot;Chicago&quot; on 30 January (two days later they also sank the destroyer much farther north in an air attack off Savo Island). The U.S. did not report the loss of &quot;Chicago&quot; to the public for some time, with Admiral Chester Nimitz—commander in chief of Allied Pacific forces—threatening to shoot any of his staff who leaked the loss to the press.

<text>The Ha&#x27;penny Bridge ( ; , or &quot;Droichead na Life&quot;), known later for a time as the &quot;Penny Ha&#x27;penny Bridge&quot;, and officially the Liffey Bridge, is a pedestrian bridge built in May 1816 over the River Liffey in Dublin, Ireland. Made of cast iron, the bridge was cast in Shropshire, England.

== Name ==

Originally called the Wellington Bridge (after the Dublin-born Duke of Wellington), the name of the bridge was changed to Liffey Bridge after the Irish War of Independence in 1922. Liffey Bridge () remains the bridge&#x27;s official name to this day, although it is most commonly referred to as the Ha&#x27;penny Bridge.

==History==

Before the Ha&#x27;penny Bridge was built there were seven ferries, operated by William Walsh, across the Liffey. The ferries were in bad condition and Walsh was informed that he had to either fix them or build a bridge. Walsh chose the latter option and the bridge was opened in May 1816, with Walsh holding the right to extract a ha&#x27;penny toll from anyone crossing it for 100 years.

Initially, the toll charge was based not on the cost of construction, but to match the charges levied by the ferries it replaced. A further condition of construction was that, if the citizens of Dublin found the bridge and toll to be &quot;objectionable&quot; within its first year of operation, it was to be removed at no cost to the city.

The toll was increased for a time to a penny-ha&#x27;penny (1½ pence), but was eventually dropped in 1919. While the toll was in operation, there were turnstiles at either end of the bridge.

The manufacture of the bridge was commissioned by the then Lord Mayor of Dublin, John Claudius Beresford with the Coalbrookdale Company of England. Using ore originally mined in County Leitrim&#x27;s Sliabh an Iarainn, the bridge&#x27;s cast iron ribs were made in 18 sections and then shipped to Dublin. The design and erection was supervised by John Windsor, one of the company&#x27;s foremen and a pattern-maker.

==Renovation and maintenance==
In 2001, the number of pedestrians using the bridge on a daily basis was 27,000 and, given these traffic levels, a structural survey indicated that renovation was required. The bridge was closed for repair and renovations during 2001 and was reopened in December 2001, sporting its original white colour.

The structure was rebuilt to retain many of its old components, although, controversially, some features were removed. The repair work was carried out by Harland &amp; Wolff.

In 2012, citing a maintenance and damage risk, Dublin City Council removed a number of love locks from the Ha&#x27;penny Bridge and nearby Millennium Bridge, and asked people not to add any more. In 2013, the council removed over of locks from the bridge, and signage was added asking people not to put padlocks on the bridge.

On 19 May 2016, the bicentenary of the bridge was celebrated with a symbolic procession over the bridge involving the current Lord Mayor, Críona Ní Dhálaigh, descendants of J.C. Beresford and John Windsor from England.

<text>Life insurance (or life assurance, especially in the Commonwealth of Nations) is a contract between an insurance policy holder and an insurer or assurer, where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money upon the death of an insured person. Depending on the contract, other events such as terminal illness or critical illness can also trigger payment. The policyholder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. The benefits may include other expenses, such as funeral expenses. 

Life policies are legal contracts and the terms of each contract describe the limitations of the insured events. Often, specific exclusions written into the contract limit the liability of the insurer; common examples include claims relating to suicide, fraud, war, riot, and civil commotion. Difficulties may arise where an event is not clearly defined, for example, the insured knowingly incurred a risk by consenting to an experimental medical procedure or by taking medication resulting in injury or death. 

Modern life insurance bears some similarity to the asset-management industry, and life insurers have diversified their product offerings into retirement products such as annuities. 

Life-based contracts tend to fall into two major categories:

* Protection policies: designed to provide a benefit, typically a lump-sum payment, in the event of a specified occurrence. A common form of a protection-policy design is term insurance.
* Investment policies: the main objective of these policies is to facilitate the growth of capital by regular or single premiums. Common forms (in the United States) are whole life, universal life, and variable life policies.

==History==

An early form of life insurance dates to Ancient Rome; &quot;burial clubs&quot; covered the cost of members&#x27; funeral expenses and assisted survivors financially. In 1816, an archeological excavation in Minya, Egypt (under an Eyalet of the Ottoman Empire) produced a Nerva–Antonine dynasty-era tablet from the ruins of the Temple of Antinous in Antinoöpolis, Aegyptus that prescribed the rules and membership dues of a burial society &quot;collegium&quot; established in Lanuvium, Italia in approximately 133 AD during the reign of Hadrian (117–138) of the Roman Empire. In 1851, future U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Joseph P. Bradley (1870–1892), once employed as an actuary for the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, submitted an article to the &quot;Journal of the Institute of Actuaries&quot; detailing an historical account of a Severan dynasty-era life table compiled by the Roman jurist Ulpian in approximately 220 AD during the reign of Elagabalus (218–222) that was included in the &quot;Digesta seu Pandectae&quot; (533) codification ordered by Justinian I (527–565) of the Eastern Roman Empire.

The earliest known life insurance policy was made in Royal Exchange, London on 18 June 1583. A Richard Martin insured a William Gybbons, paying thirteen merchants 30 pounds for 400 if the insured dies within one year. The first company to offer life insurance in modern times was the Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office, founded in London in 1706 by William Talbot and Sir Thomas Allen. Each member made an annual payment per share on one to three shares with consideration to age of the members being twelve to fifty-five. At the end of the year a portion of the &quot;amicable contribution&quot; was divided among the wives and children of deceased members, in proportion to the number of shares the heirs owned. The Amicable Society started with 2000 members.

The first life table was written by Edmund Halley in 1693, but it was only in the 1750s that the necessary mathematical and statistical tools were in place for the development of modern life insurance. James Dodson, a mathematician and actuary, tried to establish a new company aimed at correctly offsetting the risks of long-term life assurance policies, after being refused admission to the Amicable Life Assurance Society because of his advanced age. He was unsuccessful in his attempts at procuring a charter from the government.

His disciple, Edward Rowe Mores, was able to establish the Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorship in 1762. It was the world&#x27;s first mutual insurer and it pioneered age based premiums based on mortality rate laying &quot;the framework for scientific insurance practice and development&quot; and &quot;the basis of modern life assurance upon which all life assurance schemes were subsequently based&quot;.

Mores also gave the name actuary to the chief official—the earliest known reference to the position as a business concern. The first modern actuary was William Morgan, who served from 1775 to 1830. In 1776 the Society carried out the first actuarial valuation of liabilities and subsequently distributed the first reversionary bonus (1781) and interim bonus (1809) among its members. It also used regular valuations to balance competing interests. The Society sought to treat its members equitably and the Directors tried to ensure that policyholders received a fair return on their investments. Premiums were regulated according to age, and anybody could be admitted regardless of their state of health and other circumstances.
The sale of life insurance in the U.S. began in the 1760s. The Presbyterian Synods in Philadelphia and New York City created the Corporation for Relief of Poor and Distressed Widows and Children of Presbyterian Ministers in 1759; Episcopalian priests organized a similar fund in 1769. Between 1787 and 1837 more than two dozen life insurance companies were started, but fewer than half a dozen survived. In the 1870s, military officers banded together to found both the Army (AAFMAA) and the Navy Mutual Aid Association (Navy Mutual), inspired by the plight of widows and orphans left stranded in the West after the Battle of the Little Big Horn, and of the families of U.S. sailors who died at sea.

==Overview==

===Parties to contract===
The person responsible for making payments for a policy is the policy owner, while the insured is the person whose death will trigger payment of the death benefit. The owner and insured may or may not be the same person. For example, if Joe buys a policy on his own life, he is both the owner and the insured. But if Jane, his wife, buys a policy on Joe&#x27;s life, she is the owner and he is the insured. The policy owner is the guarantor and they will be the person to pay for the policy. The insured is a participant in the contract, but not necessarily a party to it.

The beneficiary receives policy proceeds upon the insured person&#x27;s death. The owner designates the beneficiary, but the beneficiary is not a party to the policy. The owner can change the beneficiary unless the policy has an irrevocable beneficiary designation. If a policy has an irrevocable beneficiary, any beneficiary changes, policy assignments, or cash value borrowing would require the agreement of the original beneficiary.

In cases where the policy owner is not the insured (also referred to as the &quot;celui qui vit&quot; or CQV), insurance companies have sought to limit policy purchases to those with an insurable interest in the CQV. For life insurance policies, close family members and business partners will usually be found to have an insurable interest. The insurable interest requirement usually demonstrates that the purchaser will actually suffer some kind of loss if the CQV dies. Such a requirement prevents people from benefiting from the purchase of purely speculative policies on people they expect to die. With no insurable interest requirement, the risk that a purchaser would murder the CQV for insurance proceeds would be great. In at least one case, an insurance company that sold a policy to a purchaser with no insurable interest (who later murdered the CQV for the proceeds), was found liable in court for contributing to the wrongful death of the victim (&quot;Liberty National Life v. Weldon&quot;, 267 Ala.171 (1957)).

===Contract terms===
Special exclusions may apply, such as suicide clauses, whereby the policy becomes null and void if the insured dies by suicide within a specified time (usually two years after the purchase date; some states provide a statutory one-year suicide clause). Any misrepresentations by the insured on the application may also be grounds for nullification. Most US states, for example, specify a maximum contestability period, often no more than two years. Only if the insured dies within this period will the insurer have a legal right to contest the claim on the basis of misrepresentation and request additional information before deciding whether to pay or deny the claim.

The face amount of the policy is the initial amount that the policy will pay at the death of the insured or when the policy matures, although the actual death benefit can provide for greater or lesser than the face amount. The policy matures when the insured dies or reaches a specified age (such as 100 years old).

===Costs, insurability, and underwriting===
The insurance company calculates the policy prices (premiums) at a level sufficient to fund claims, cover administrative costs, and provide a profit. The cost of insurance is determined using mortality tables calculated by actuaries. Mortality tables are statistically based tables showing expected annual mortality rates of people at different ages. As people are more likely to die as they get older, the mortality tables enable insurance companies to calculate the risk and increase premiums with age accordingly. Such estimates can be important in taxation regulation.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the SOA 1975-80 Basic Select &amp; Ultimate tables were the typical reference points, while the 2001 VBT and 2001 CSO tables were published more recently. As well as the basic parameters of age and gender, the newer tables include separate mortality tables for smokers and non-smokers, and the CSO tables include separate tables for preferred classes.

The mortality tables provide a baseline for the cost of insurance, but the health and family history of the individual applicant is also taken into account (except in the case of Group policies). This investigation and resulting evaluation is termed underwriting. Health and lifestyle questions are asked, with certain responses possibly meriting further investigation. 

Specific factors that may be considered by underwriters include:

* Personal medical history;
* Family medical history;
* Driving record;
* Height and weight matrix, otherwise known as BMI (Body Mass Index).

Based on the above and additional factors, applicants will be placed into one of several classes of health ratings which will determine the premium paid in exchange for insurance at that particular carrier.

Life insurance companies in the United States support the Medical Information Bureau (MIB), which is a clearing house of information on persons who have applied for life insurance with participating companies in the last seven years. As part of the application, the insurer often requires the applicant&#x27;s permission to obtain information from their physicians.

Automated Life Underwriting is a technology solution which is designed to perform all or some of the screening functions traditionally completed by underwriters, and thus seeks to reduce the work effort, time and data necessary to underwrite a life insurance application. These systems allow point of sale distribution and can shorten the time frame for issuance from weeks or even months to hours or minutes, depending on the amount of insurance being purchased.

The mortality of underwritten persons rises much more quickly than the general population. At the end of 10 years, the mortality of that 25-year-old, non-smoking male is 0.66/1000/year. Consequently, in a group of one thousand 25-year-old males with a $100,000 policy, all of average health, a life insurance company would have to collect approximately $50 a year from each participant to cover the relatively few expected claims. (0.35 to 0.66 expected deaths in each year × $100,000 payout per death = $35 per policy.) Other costs, such as administrative and sales expenses, also need to be considered when setting the premiums. A 10-year policy for a 25-year-old non-smoking male with preferred medical history may get offers as low as $90 per year for a $100,000 policy in the competitive US life insurance market.

Most of the revenue received by insurance companies consists of premiums, but revenue from investing the premiums forms an important source of profit for most life insurance companies. Group insurance policies are an exception to this.

In the United States, life insurance companies are never legally required to provide coverage to everyone, with the exception of Civil Rights Act compliance requirements. Insurance companies alone determine insurability, and some people are deemed uninsurable. The policy can be declined or rated (increasing the premium amount to compensate for the higher risk), and the amount of the premium will be proportional to the face value of the policy.

Many companies separate applicants into four general categories. These categories are &quot;preferred best&quot;, &quot;preferred&quot;, &quot;standard&quot;, and &quot;tobacco&quot;. Preferred best is reserved only for the healthiest individuals in the general population. This may mean, that the proposed insured has no adverse medical history, is not under medication, and has no family history of early-onset cancer, diabetes, or other conditions. Preferred means that the proposed insured is currently under medication and has a family history of particular illnesses. Most people are in the standard category.

People in the tobacco category typically have to pay higher premiums due to higher mortality. Recent US mortality tables predict that roughly 0.35 in 1,000 non-smoking males aged 25 will die during the first year of a policy. Mortality approximately doubles for every additional ten years of age, so the mortality rate in the first year for non-smoking men is about 2.5 in 1,000 people at age 65. Compare this with the US population male mortality rates of 1.3 per 1,000 at age 25 and 19.3 at age 65 (without regard to health or smoking status).

===Death benefits===
Upon the insured&#x27;s death, the insurer requires acceptable proof of death before it pays the claim. If the insured&#x27;s death is suspicious and the policy amount is large, the insurer may investigate the circumstances surrounding the death before deciding whether it has an obligation to pay the claim.

Payment from the policy may be as a lump sum or as an annuity, which is paid in regular installments for either a specified period or for the beneficiary&#x27;s lifetime.

Death benefits are the primary feature of life insurance policies, and they provide a lump sum payment to the beneficiaries of the policyholder in the event of the policyholder&#x27;s death. The amount of the death benefit is typically determined at the time the policy is purchased, and it is based on factors such as the policyholder&#x27;s age, health, and occupation.

The death benefit is only payable if the policyholder dies while the policy is in effect. If the policyholder outlives the policy, the death benefit is not paid, and the policy will typically expire. Some policies may allow the policyholder to receive a portion of the premiums paid if they outlive the policy.

===Insurance vs assurance===
The specific uses of the terms &quot;insurance&quot; and &quot;assurance&quot; are sometimes confused. In general, in jurisdictions where both terms are used, &quot;insurance&quot; refers to providing coverage for an event that &quot;might&quot; happen (fire, theft, flood, etc.), while &quot;assurance&quot; is the provision of coverage for an event that is &quot;certain&quot; to happen. In the United States, both forms of coverage are called &quot;insurance&quot; for reasons of simplicity in companies selling both products. By some definitions, &quot;insurance&quot; is any coverage that determines benefits based on actual losses whereas &quot;assurance&quot; is coverage with predetermined benefits irrespective of the losses incurred.

Life insurance may be divided into two basic classes: temporary and permanent; or the following subclasses: term, universal, whole life, and endowment life insurance.

===Term insurance===
Term assurance provides life insurance coverage for a specified term (usually 10–30 years). Term life insurance policies do not accumulate cash value, but are significantly less expensive than permanent life insurance policies with equivalent face amounts. Policyholders can save to provide for increased term premiums or decrease insurance needs (by paying off debts or saving to provide for survivor needs).

&quot;Mortgage life insurance&quot; insures a loan secured by real property and usually features a level premium amount for a declining policy face value because what is insured is the principal and interest outstanding on a mortgage that is constantly being reduced by mortgage payments. The face amount of the policy is always the amount of the principal and interest outstanding that are paid should the applicant die before the final installment is paid.

==== Group life insurance ====
&quot;Group life insurance&quot; (also known as &quot;wholesale life insurance&quot; or &quot;institutional life insurance&quot;) is term insurance covering a group of people, usually employees of a company, members of a union or association, or members of a pension or superannuation fund. Individual proof of insurability is not normally a consideration in its underwriting. Rather, the underwriter considers the size, turnover, and financial strength of the group. Contract provisions will attempt to exclude the possibility of adverse selection. Group life insurance often allows members exiting the group to maintain their coverage by buying individual coverage. The underwriting is carried out for the whole group instead of individuals.

===Permanent life insurance===
&quot;Permanent life insurance&quot; is life insurance that covers the remaining lifetime of the insured. A permanent insurance policy accumulates a cash value up to its date of maturation. The owner can access the money in the cash value by withdrawing money, borrowing the cash value, or surrendering the policy and receiving the surrender value.

The three basic types of permanent insurance are &quot;whole life&quot;, &quot;universal life&quot;, and &quot;endowment&quot;.

====Whole life====

Whole life insurance provides lifetime coverage for a set premium amount.

====Universal life coverage====
Universal life insurance (ULl) is a relatively new insurance product, intended to combine permanent insurance coverage with greater flexibility in premium payments, along with the potential for greater growth of cash values. There are several types of universal life insurance policies, including &quot;interest-sensitive&quot; (also known as &quot;traditional fixed universal life insurance&quot;), &quot;variable universal life (VUL)&quot;, &quot;guaranteed death benefit&quot;, and has &quot;equity-indexed universal life insurance&quot;.

Universal life insurance policies have cash values. Paid-in premiums increase their cash values; administrative and other costs reduce their cash values.

Universal life insurance addresses the perceived disadvantages of whole life—namely that premiums and death benefits are fixed. With universal life, both the premiums and death benefit are flexible. With the exception of guaranteed-death-benefit universal life policies, universal life policies trade their greater flexibility for fewer guarantees.

&quot;Flexible death benefit&quot; means the policy owner can choose to decrease the death benefit. The death benefit can also be increased by the policy owner, usually requiring new underwriting. Another feature of flexible death benefit is the ability to choose option A or option B death benefits and to change those options over the course of the life of the insured. Option A is often referred to as a &quot;level death benefit&quot;; death benefits remain level for the life of the insured, and premiums are lower than policies with Option B death benefits, which pay the policy&#x27;s cash value—i.e., a face amount plus earnings/interest. If the cash value grows over time, the death benefits do too. If the cash value declines, the death benefit also declines. Option B policies normally feature higher premiums than option A policies.

====Endowments====

The endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term (on its &#x27;maturity&#x27;) or on death. Typical maturities are ten, fifteen, or twenty years up to a certain age limit. Some policies also pay out in the case of critical illness.

Policies are typically traditional with-profits or unit-linked (including those with unitized with-profits funds).

Endowments can be cashed in early (or surrendered) and the holder then receives the surrender value which is determined by the insurance company depending on how long the policy has been running and how much has been paid into it.

====Accidental death====
Accidental death insurance is a type of limited life insurance that is designed to cover the insured should they die as a result of an accident. &quot;Accidents&quot; run the gamut from abrasions to catastrophes but normally do not include deaths resulting from non-accident-related health problems or suicide. Because they only cover accidents, these policies are much less expensive than other life insurance policies.

Such insurance can also be &quot;accidental death and dismemberment insurance&quot; or &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;. In an AD&amp;D policy, benefits are available not only for accidental death but also for the loss of limbs or body functions such as sight and hearing.

Accidental death and AD&amp;D policies pay actual benefits only very rarely, either because the cause of death is not covered by the policy or because death occurs well after the accident, by which time the premiums have gone unpaid. Various AD&amp;D policies have different terms and exclusions. Risky activities such as parachuting, flying, professional sports, or military service are often omitted from coverage.

Accidental death insurance can also supplement standard life insurance as a rider. If a rider is purchased, the policy generally pays double the face amount if the insured dies from an accident. This was once called &quot;double indemnity insurance&quot;. In some cases, triple indemnity coverage may be available.

==== Senior and pre-need products ====
Insurance companies also offer products targeted at niche markets, such as seniors. These policies are often low face value whole life insurance policies, allowing individuals (ages 50-90) to purchase affordable insurance later in life. These may also be marketed as &quot;final expense insurance&quot; or burial insurance and usually have death benefits between $1,000 and $50,000. A major reason for their popularity is their use of &quot;simplified underwriting&quot;. With simplified underwriting, applicants are not required to take a medical exam; approval depends on the applicant&#x27;s answers to a set of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; health questions as well as a check of their prescription drug history.

Health requirements can vary substantially between exam and no-exam policies. It may be possible for individuals with certain conditions to qualify for one type of coverage and not another. .

&quot;Pre-need life insurance policies&quot; are limited-premium whole life policies that are usually purchased by older applicants, though they are available to everyone. This type of insurance is designed to cover specific funeral expenses that the applicant has designated in a contract with a funeral home. The policy&#x27;s death benefit is initially based on the funeral cost at the time of prearrangement, and it then typically grows as interest is credited. In exchange for the policy owner&#x27;s designation, the funeral home typically guarantees that the proceeds will cover the cost of the funeral, no matter when death occurs. Excess proceeds may go either to the insured&#x27;s estate, a designated beneficiary, or the funeral home as set forth in the contract. Purchasers of these policies usually make a single premium payment at the time of prearrangement, but some companies also allow premiums to be paid over as much as ten years.

==Related products==
&quot;Riders&quot; are modifications to the insurance policy added at the same time the policy is issued. These riders change the basic policy to provide some features desired by the policy owner. A common rider is &quot;accidental death&quot;. Another common rider is a &quot;premium waiver&quot;, which waives future premiums if the insured becomes disabled.

&quot;Joint life insurance&quot; is either term or permanent life insurance that insures two or more persons, with proceeds payable on the death of &quot;either&quot;.

===Unit-linked insurance plans===

Unit-linked insurance plans are unique insurance plans which are similar to mutual funds and term insurance plans combined as one product. The investor does not participate in the profits of the plan per se but gets returns based on the returns on the chosen funds.

===With-profits policies===

Some policies afford the policyholder a share of the profits of the insurance company—these are termed with-profits policies. Other policies provide no rights to a share of the profits of the company—these are &quot;non-profit&quot; policies.

With-profit policies are used as a form of collective investment scheme to achieve capital growth. Other policies offer a guaranteed return not dependent on the company&#x27;s underlying investment performance; these are often referred to as &quot;without-profit&quot; policies, which may be construed as a misnomer.

==Taxation==

=== India ===
According to section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (now to be replaced by Section 123 of Income Tax Act, 2025 with effect from 01.04.2026) premiums paid towards a valid life insurance policy can be exempted from the taxable income. Along with life insurance premiums, section 80C allows an exemption for other financial instruments such as Employee Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), National Savings Certificate (NSC), and health insurance premiums are some of them. The total amount that can be exempted from the taxable income for section 80C is capped at a maximum of INR 150,000. The exemptions are eligible for individuals (Indian citizens) or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF).

Apart from tax benefit under section 80C, in India, a policy holder is entitled for a tax exemption on the death benefit received. The received amount is fully exempt from Income Tax under Section 10(10D).

===Australia===
Where the life insurance is provided through a superannuation fund, contributions made to fund insurance premiums are tax deductible for self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons and employers. However, where life insurance is held outside of the superannuation environment, the premiums are generally not tax deductible. For insurance through a superannuation fund, the annual deductible contributions to the superannuation funds are subject to age limits. These limits apply to employers making deductible contributions. They also apply to self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons. Included in these overall limits are insurance premiums. This means that no additional deductible contributions can be made for the funding of insurance premiums. Insurance premiums can, however, be funded by undeducted contributions. For further information on deductible contributions see &quot;under what conditions can an employer claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of their employees?&quot; and &quot;what is the definition of substantially self-employed?&quot;. The insurance premium paid by the superannuation fund can be claimed by the fund as a deduction to reduce the 15% tax on contributions and earnings. (Ref: ITAA 1936, Section 279).

===South Africa===
Premiums paid by a policyholder are not deductible from taxable income, although premiums paid via an approved pension fund registered in terms of the Income Tax Act are permitted to be deducted from personal income tax (whether these premiums are nominally being paid by the employer or employee). The benefits arising from life assurance policies are generally not taxable as income to beneficiaries (again in the case of approved benefits, these fall under retirement or withdrawal taxation rules from SARS). Investment return within the policy will be taxed within the life policy and paid by the life assurer depending on the nature of the policyholder (whether natural person, company-owned, untaxed, or a retirement fund).

===United States===
Premiums paid by the policy owner are normally not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes, and proceeds paid by the insurer upon the death of the insured are not included in gross income for federal and state income tax purposes. However, if the proceeds are included in the &quot;estate&quot; of the deceased, it is likely they will be subject to federal and state estate and inheritance tax.

Cash value increases within the policy are not subject to income taxes unless certain events occur. For this reason, insurance policies can be legal and legitimate tax shelter wherein savings can increase without taxation until the owner withdraws the money from the policy. In flexible-premium policies, large deposits of premiums could cause the contract to be considered a &quot;modified endowment contract&quot; by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which negates many of the tax advantages associated with life insurance. The insurance company, in most cases, will inform the policy owner of this danger before deciding their premium.

The tax ramifications of life insurance are complex. The policy owner would be well advised to carefully consider them. As always, both the United States Congress and state legislatures can change the tax laws at any time.

In 2018, a fiduciary standard rule on retirement products by the United States Department of Labor posed a possible risk.

===United Kingdom===
Premiums are not usually deductible against income tax or corporation tax, however, qualifying policies issued prior to 14 March 1984 do still attract LAPR (Life Assurance Premium Relief) at 15% (with the net premium being collected from the policyholder).

Non-investment life policies do not normally attract either income tax or capital gains tax on a claim. If the policy has an investment element such as an endowment policy, whole of life policy, or an investment bond then the tax treatment is determined by the qualifying status of the policy.

Qualifying status is determined at the outset of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long-term contracts (10+ years) tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax. Single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made. All UK insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) of liability for policyholders. Therefore, a policyholder who is a higher-rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called top-slicing based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance-based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes (unit trusts, investment trusts, and OEICs). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the &quot;5% cumulative allowance&quot;—the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax-deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the HMRC (Her Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs) to be a payment of capital and therefore, the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful tax planning tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future, as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being due.

The proceeds of a life policy will be included in the estate for death duty (in the UK, inheritance tax) purposes. Policies written in trust may fall outside the estate. Trust law and taxation of trusts can be complicated, so any individual intending to use trusts for tax planning would usually seek professional advice from an independent financial adviser or solicitor.

====Pension term assurance====
Although available before April 2006, from this date pension term assurance became widely available in the UK. Most UK insurers adopted the name &quot;life insurance with tax relief&quot; for the product. Pension term assurance is effectively normal term life assurance with tax relief on the premiums. All premiums are paid at a net basic rate tax of 22%, and higher-rate taxpayers can gain an extra 18% tax relief via their tax return. Although not suitable for all, PTA briefly became one of the most common forms of life assurance sold in the UK until Chancellor Gordon Brown announced the withdrawal of the scheme in his pre-budget announcement on 6 December 2006.

==Stranger originated==
&quot;Stranger-originated life insurance&quot; or STOLI is a life insurance policy that is held or financed by a person who has no relationship to the insured person. Generally, the purpose of life insurance is to provide peace of mind by assuring that financial loss or hardship will be alleviated in the event of the insured person&#x27;s death. STOLI has often been used as an investment technique whereby investors will encourage someone (usually an elderly person) to purchase life insurance and name the investors as the beneficiary of the policy. This undermines the primary purpose of life insurance, as the investors would incur no financial loss should the insured person die. In some jurisdictions, there are laws to discourage or prevent STOLI.

==Criticism==

Although some aspects of the application process (such as underwriting and insurable interest provisions) make it difficult, life insurance policies have been used to facilitate exploitation and  fraud. In the case of life insurance, there is a possible motive to purchase a life insurance policy, particularly if the face value is substantial, and then murder the insured. Usually, the larger the claim or the more serious the incident, the larger and more intense the ensuing investigation by police and insurer investigators. Multiple fictional and non-fictional works, including books, films, television series and podcasts have featured the scenario as a plot device or actually occurring as a true crime. There was also a documented case in Los Angeles in 2006 where two elderly women were accused of taking in homeless men and assisting them. As part of their assistance, they took out life insurance for the men. After the contestability period ended on the policies, the women are alleged to have had the men killed via hit-and-run vehicular homicide.

On April 17, 2016, a report by Lesley Stahl on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; claimed that life insurance companies do not pay significant numbers of beneficiaries. This is because many people named as beneficiaries never submit claims to the insurance companies upon the death of the insured, and are unaware that any benefit exists to be claimed, though the insurance companies have full knowledge. The amounts of such benefits are often small, but the numbers of would-be beneficiaries are quite large. These unclaimed benefits eventually become sources of profit.

<doc id="383368" wikidata="Q11848755" url="?curid=383368" title="Grey-tailed tattler">
<text>The grey-tailed tattler (Tringa brevipes, formerly &quot;Heteroscelus brevipes&quot;), also known as the Siberian tattler or Polynesian tattler, is a small shorebird in the genus &quot;Tringa&quot;. The English name for the tattlers refers to their noisy call. The genus name &quot;Tringa&quot; is the Neo-Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek &quot;trungas&quot;, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific &quot;brevipes&quot; is from Latin &quot;brevis&quot;, &quot;short&quot;, and &quot;pes&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;.

This tattler breeds in northeast Siberia. After breeding, they migrate to an area from southeast Asia to Australia.

== Description ==
The grey-tailed tattler is closely related to its North American counterpart, the wandering tattler (&quot;T. incana&quot;) and is difficult to distinguish from that species. Both tattlers are unique among the species of &quot;Tringa&quot; for having unpatterned, greyish wings and back, and a scaly breast pattern extending more or less onto the belly in breeding plumage, in which both also have a rather prominent supercilium.

These birds resemble common redshanks in shape and size. The upper parts, underwings, face and neck are grey, and the belly is white. They have short yellowish legs and a bill with a pale base and dark tip. There is a weak supercilium.

They are very similar to their American counterpart, and differentiation depends on details like the length of the nasal groove and scaling on the tarsus. The best distinction is the call; grey-tailed has a disyllabic whistle, and wandering a rippling trill.

== Behaviour ==
Its breeding habitat is stony riverbeds in northeast Siberia. It nests on the ground, but these birds will perch in trees. They sometimes use old nests of other birds as well.

Grey-tailed tattlers are strongly migratory and winter on muddy and sandy coasts from southeast Asia to Australia. They are very rare vagrants to western North America and western Europe. These are not particularly gregarious birds and are seldom seen in large flocks except at roosts.

These birds forage on the ground or water, picking up food by sight. They eat insects, crustaceans and other invertebrates.

== Conservation status ==

=== Australia ===
Grey-tailed tattlers are not listed as &quot;threatened&quot; on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

The grey-tailed tattler is listed as &quot;threatened&quot; on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988). Under this Act, an &quot;Action Statement&quot; for the recovery and future management of this species has not been prepared. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the grey-tailed tattler is listed as critically endangered.

<text>Patrick George Hentgen (born November 13, 1968) is an American former professional baseball pitcher, and currently a special assistant with the Toronto Blue Jays organization. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Blue Jays, St. Louis Cardinals, and Baltimore Orioles from 1991 to 2004. In 1996, he won the American League (AL) Cy Young Award.

==Early life==
Hentgen was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1968. He attended Fraser High School in Fraser, Michigan, and was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the fifth round of the 1986 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Blue Jays in June 1986.

==Professional baseball career==
Hentgen pitched in the minor leagues from 1986 to 1990. He then split the 1991 and 1992 seasons with the Syracuse Chiefs of the International League and the Toronto Blue Jays. He made his major league debut with the Blue Jays in September 1991.

Hentgen spent the 1993 season with Toronto. He was an All-Star and finished the year with a 19–9 win–loss record and a 3.87 earned run average. He won his only start in the 1993 World Series and helped the Blue Jays win the championship. The following season, Hentgen was an All-Star again and went 13–8 with a 3.40 ERA. In 1995, he pitched poorly, going 10–14 with a 5.11 ERA and leading the AL with 236 hits allowed and 114 earned runs allowed.

In 1996, Hentgen went 8–6 before the All-Star break and then went 12–4 after the All-Star break. He won back-to-back AL pitcher of the month awards in July and August. Hentgen finished the season with a 20–10 win–loss record and a 3.22 ERA, ranking second in the AL in wins and ERA. He led the league with 265.2 innings pitched, 10 complete games, and 3 shutouts. For his efforts, he won the AL Cy Young Award, the first in Blue Jays franchise history.

The following year, Hentgen was an All-Star for the third and final time. He went 15–10 with a 3.68 ERA and led the AL with 264 innings pitched, 9 complete games, and 3 shutouts. In 1998, he went 12–11 with a 5.17 ERA. In 1999, he went 11–12 with a 4.79 ERA.

In November 1999, the Blue Jays traded Hentgen to the St. Louis Cardinals. He spent the 2000 season with the Cardinals, going 15–12 with a 4.72 ERA. In December 2000, Hentgen signed as a free agent with the Baltimore Orioles. In 2001, he went 2–3 with a 3.47 ERA and had Tommy John surgery in August. He went 0–4 with a 7.77 ERA in 2002 and 7–8 with a 4.09 ERA in 2003.

Hentgen signed as a free agent with the Blue Jays in November 2003. In 2004, he went 2–9 with a 6.95 ERA and then announced his retirement in July. Hentgen finished his MLB career with a 131–112 record, a 4.32 ERA, and 1,290 strikeouts in 2,075.1 innings pitched.

==Post-playing career==
Hentgen rejoined the Toronto Blue Jays under new manager John Farrell as their new bullpen coach for the 2011 season. It was Hentgen&#x27;s first coaching assignment. He stepped down in November 2011 due to family reasons, and was given the title of Special Assistant to the Organization. On December 10, 2012, Hentgen was again appointed as the Blue Jays bullpen coach.

On January 4, 2014, the Blue Jays announced that Bob Stanley would be replacing Hentgen as their bullpen coach. Hentgen continued to work with the Blue Jays, as a special assistant to the organization.

Hentgen was named to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in the Class of 2016.

* &quot;Yankee Go Home?: Canadians and Anti-Americanism&quot; (1996) Granatstein maintains that what began as a justifiable fear of invasion eventually became a tool of the economic and political elites bent on preserving their power. At first, anti-Americanism was largely the Tory way of keeping pro-British attitudes uppermost in the minds of Canadians. Later, with the right wing embracing the free-trade deal, it became the most important weapon of the nationalist left.

<text>The nankeen kestrel (Falco cenchroides), also known as the Australian kestrel, is a raptor native to Australia and New Guinea. It is one of the smallest falcons, and unlike many, does not rely on speed to catch its prey. Instead, it simply perches in an exposed position, but it also has a distinctive technique of hovering over crop and grasslands. 

== Taxonomy ==
The nankeen kestrel is a species of the genus &quot;Falco&quot;, allied to a subgenus &quot;Tinnunculus&quot;. They were first described by Nicholas Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827. Further descriptions — regarded as synonyms for the species — were published: &quot;Cerchneis immaculata&quot; Brehm, 1845; the later name &quot;Cerchneis unicolor&quot; by Alexander Milligan was published in &quot;Emu&quot; in 1904; and that author&#x27;s name appearing in the assignment to a subspecies, &quot;Cerchneis cenchroides milligani&quot;, published by Gregory Mathews in 1912.

The generic name is Late Latin &quot;falco&quot; &#x27;falcon&#x27; (from &quot;falx&quot; &quot;falcis&quot;, &#x27;sickle&#x27;) and the specific epithet is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;kenkhris&quot; &#x27;kestrel&#x27; and &quot;-oides&quot; &#x27;resembling&#x27;. 

The common names Mosquito Hawk, Kestrel, Windhover, Hoverer are cited in the Australian Faunal Directory. Its common descriptor refers to the colour of nankeen cloth, originally a yellowish cotton from Nankeen or Nanking (modern Nanjing), China. 

This bird is thought to be a very close relative of the Eurasian kestrel (&quot;Falco tinnunculus&quot;), and probably also the spotted kestrel (&quot;Falco moluccensis&quot;). It seems to have evolved from ancestral common kestrels dispersing to the Australian region in the Middle Pleistocene — less than years ago — and adapting to local conditions.

Two subspecies are recognised: the nominate subspecies &quot;Falco cenchroides cenchroides&quot; is found throughout Australia and Tasmania, as well as Christmas Island, Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island, and as a non-breeding visitor to southern New Guinea; and &quot;F. c. baru&quot; Rand, 1940 is found in the Snow Mountains of west central New Guinea.

==Description==
The nankeen kestrel is a small, slim falcon long with a wingspan of . The male weighs while the female weighs . It has pale rufous upper-parts with contrasting black flight-feathers and is finely streaked white below, with a black subterminal band. The , eye-ring, and legs are yellow. The male has a pale grey crown and tail with a darker grey tear-mark, while the female and juvenile have a pale rufous crown and finely barred rufous tail. Plumage varies considerably in detail, and some birds can look very scruffy, but the slim build, small size and distinctive straight-winged hovering habit make identification easy. The only other Australasian raptors to hover are the elanid kites, which are much lighter in colour and a little larger, and the brown falcon, which is much larger and more heavily built, and hovers only occasionally. Altogether, the nankeen kestrel looks just like a pale, less patterned, and smaller derivate of the Eurasian kestrel, which it indeed is (see Gloger&#x27;s Rule, Bergmann&#x27;s Rule).

==Distribution and habitat==

A very common and easily seen raptor, the nankeen kestrel is found in Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands, and is an irregular visitor to New Zealand. It occupies any type of land that is not too densely vegetated, but in particular temperate grasslands and open woodlands. In the tropical north and the sandy deserts of the west, it has a patchy and seasonal distribution. It can be seen in Western Australia on coastal cliffs and windy conditions. Also seen on phone lines and power lines. 

Like many Australian birds, it has no clear migratory pattern: in the grasslands of the south, established pairs are resident year-round, but many other birds migrate north during the austral winter, or roam the arid interior following food supplies. Typically seen singly or in pairs, they can aggregate into loose flocks of up to 30 when conditions are right. Pairs are typically monogamous and may or may not disperse to different areas during the non-breeding season. The nest is any convenient structure: a tree hollow, cliff ledge or disused corvid&#x27;s nest, for example, and is not modified or added to by the kestrels.

==Feeding==
Diet is varied, with a large number of insects, but also small birds and reptiles, and in particular, small rodents, mostly mice. Nankeen kestrels are adaptable and hunt in a number of different ways: of these, simply perching in an exposed position (such as on a dead tree or a telephone pole) and watching for prey is the most common, but it is their habit of hovering motionless over crop and grasslands that is most distinctive.

==Breeding==
Three to seven eggs are laid in late winter (usually about four) and incubated by the female alone. Hatching takes place after 26 to 28 days, and the male brings food while the female continues to incubate until the young are close to fledging, at which time the female leaves the nest to hunt for them too. Multiple broods are raised in good seasons.

<doc id="383384" wikidata="Q7054941" url="?curid=383384" title="North County">
<text>North County is a region in the northern area of San Diego County, California. It is the second-most populous region in the county (after San Diego), with an estimated population of 869,322. North County is well known for its affluence, especially in Encinitas, Carlsbad, Del Mar, Rancho Santa Fe, Poway and Solana Beach, where house prices range, on average, above $1,000,000. Cities along the 78 freeway (Oceanside, Vista, San Marcos and Escondido) have more mixed incomes.

Beach culture is prominent in the area, and many of the region&#x27;s beaches and lagoons are protected areas to help ensure the environment remains pristine, though there has been pressure from commercial entities to develop some of these areas.

==History==
The name dates to at least the 1970s, when many of the communities in the area were yet to become incorporated cities and local community decisions were made away at the county seat. The North County section of San Diego County has historically been the most expensive region of San Diego, with such affluent neighborhoods as Aviara, Cardiff-by-the-Sea, Carlsbad, Carmel Valley, Del Mar, Encinitas, La Costa, Leucadia, Olivenhain, Rancho Santa Fe, and Solana Beach.

In modern times, North County continues to grow as a highly influential region of Greater San Diego. The top 25 employers in San Diego County are closer to the North County city of Carlsbad than San Diego proper.

==Geography==
North County is commonly divided into coastal and inland regions. The coastal region is almost entirely incorporated, consisting of the cities of Oceanside, Carlsbad, Encinitas, Solana Beach and Del Mar, along with Camp Pendleton South. The inland region includes the cities of Escondido, Vista, San Marcos, as well as numerous unincorporated areas. Semi-rural inland communities such as Valley Center and Ramona, which have traditionally been primarily agricultural but now function increasingly as bedroom communities for the more populous areas to their south and west, are generally included within inland North County. More remote inland communities like Julian and Borrego Springs are generally not included. Some consider communities in the northern parts of the city of San Diego like Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Peñasquitos, and Carmel Valley to be part of North County as well.

Both coastal and inland North County contain two types of topography. In coastal areas of North County, the land is generally flat with low rolling hills. The beaches are sandy with occasional tidepools and rocky reefs. In some cases, the coast is dominated by type geography, where the land meeting the ocean sharply drops into the sea with a short beach. In some cases, such as in Encinitas, a whole city is bisected by a coastal foothill ridge. The foothills of mountains soon become visible as one travels further east and encounters the rocky peaks of inland North County. Such peaks include Black Mountain, San Marcos Mountain, Palomar Mountain. The coastal area also becomes more rugged to the north, where the Santa Margarita Mountains dominate the area within the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.

North San Diego County is known as one of the most geographically diverse places on earth, with bluffs, sandy beaches, canyons and rolling hills on the coast, humid inland valleys, rocky foothills, temperate mountains, rolling grassland and large lakes and rivers in the interior, and arid deserts, lush oases and sand dunes in the far east region.

Rivers and creeks that flow west from the mountains farther inland mostly end up draining into the region&#x27;s four main lagoons. Throughout their course, these rivers are interrupted by many lakes and reservoirs which support an array of native species.

Spanning in the northwestern corner of the county, Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton forms a large buffer separating the coastal populated areas of North County from neighboring Orange County, preventing the creation of a complete coastal megalopolis stretching from Santa Monica to Imperial Beach.

===Ecology===

The region has strong ties to its coastline and has made notable efforts to preserve many marine environments, including lagoons and tidal wetlands, many of those being the final few on the South Coast. Unlike developments in many Orange County coastal cities, the lagoons and large areas of coast have not yet been so heavily developed. Major lagoons and inlets lining the coast from north to south include: Oceanside Harbor, Buena Vista Lagoon, Agua Hedionda Lagoon, Batiquitos Lagoon, San Elijo Lagoon, and Los Peñasquitos Lagoon.

===Flora and fauna===
The lagoons provide valuable wetland habitat for many birds, reptiles, fish, and plant species. The waters off the coast are also very rich in species diversity, supporting large kelp forests and rocky reefs.

Fish species included the tidewater goby, topsmelt, striped mullet, surfperch and Pacific staghorn sculpin. Leopard sharks forage near the lagoons, and their pups frequent the shallow rocky reefs off the coast.

Bird species included the great blue heron, snowy plover, Ridgway&#x27;s rail and least tern. The lagoons support various species of shorebirds, wading birds, waterfowl, raptors and diving birds. The number of bird species in the San Dieguito wetlands have tripled due to restoration projects by Del Mar.

The Torrey Pine is also one of the most famous trees in the region.

==Culture==
===Recreation===
North County contains forty golf courses, including Torrey Pines, which hosted the 2008 and 2021 U.S. Open. North County is also known for its beaches, which stretch about thirty miles from Del Mar to San Onofre. These beaches experience a large tourist influx from June to November. Symbolic of North County&#x27;s surf culture are the various statues proliferating the region including the Cardiff Kook in Cardiff-by-the-Sea. As surf culture is an integral part of North County, so is equestrian culture. Numerous equestrian centers, including the Del Mar Fairgrounds, Rancho Camino Equestrian Center, and San Diego Country Estates International Equestrian Center, are found in the region from Del Mar to San Diego Country Estates.

North County is home to Southern California&#x27;s only five-star, five-diamond and Michelin starred restaurants: Addison at The Grand Del Mar (three Michelin stars), and El Bizcocho at Rancho Bernardo Inn.

===Fairs and shopping===
The Del Mar Fairgrounds is home to one of the most famous racetracks in the world and is the site of the annual San Diego County Fair. Shopping malls include the North County Mall in Escondido and the Shoppes at Carlsbad in Carlsbad. The Cedros Design District in Solana Beach offers more than 85 shops, boutiques and galleries that specialize in antiques, handmade jewelry, unique artifacts, fine art, and more. Famous beaches include Moonlight Beach in Encinitas and the Oceanside Pier.

===In the media===
Locations in North County appear in popular television and films. Camp Pendleton is often featured in military-themed shows such as &quot;&quot;, and is the setting of the first season of &quot;Major Dad&quot;. The Del Mar Fair is also portrayed in shows such as &quot;Entourage&quot;. &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; is set in a fictional city north of San Diego; much of the show was filmed in Oceanside. Other crime-related shows, such as TNT&#x27;s &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot; and Netflix&#x27;s &quot;American Vandal&quot;, are filmed and set in Oceanside. For two seasons the Showtime comedy &quot;Weeds&quot; was set in the fictional San Diego suburb of Ren Mar, which is implied to be in North County. &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, which is set in Pasadena, features an episode (&quot;The Zarnecki Incursion&quot;) where the main characters make a three-hour drive to Carlsbad to confront a World of Warcraft hacker.

A notable fictional character from North County is shock jock Dave Rickards&#x27; &quot;Aunt Edna&quot;, frequently featured on the popular &quot;Dave, Shelly, and Chainsaw&quot; radio program, which airs in the San Diego area.

==Demographics==
North County is wealthier and more conservative than the city of San Diego and has traditionally leaned toward the Republican Party. In recent decades, however, like many highly-educated metropolitan regions throughout the United States, the region has shifted toward the Democratic Party and political liberalism more generally. This shift has been most pronounced along the coast, while some inland communities continue to lean Republican, particularly more rural ones.

In North County, white-collar jobs outnumber blue-collar jobs at a ratio of 3:1. More people have Bachelor of Arts degrees than associate&#x27;s degrees at a ratio of 2:1. More people are married than single by 2:1. Statistics compiled by the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency reveal that coastal North County is 59% white, 18% Hispanic and 6% Asian, with blacks and people of other races less than 5%. Inland North County has roughly the same racial makeup, except that 9% are Asian. 19% of coastal North County residents make more than $100,000 per year, and 44% make less than $45,000, with the rest in the medium income range. Inland North County income stats are largely the same, except that only 42% make less than $45,000.

<text>The pectoral sandpiper (Calidris melanotos) is a small, migratory wader that breeds in North America and Asia, wintering in South America and Oceania. It eats small invertebrates. Its nest, a hole scraped in the ground and with a thick lining, is deep enough to protect its four eggs from the cool breezes of its breeding grounds. The pectoral sandpiper is long, with a wingspan of .

==Taxonomy==
The pectoral sandpiper is sometimes separated with the &quot;stint&quot; sandpipers in &quot;Erolia&quot;. This may or may not represent a good monophyletic group, depending on the placement of the phylogenetically enigmatic curlew sandpiper (&quot;&quot;C.&quot; ferruginea&quot;), the type species of &quot;Erolia&quot;. In any case, the genus name &quot;Ereunetes&quot;—formerly used for the western sandpiper (&quot;&quot;C.&quot; mauri&quot;) and semipalmated sandpiper (&quot;&quot;C.&quot; pusilla&quot;), which are also members of the stint clade—was established before &quot;Erolia&quot;.

&quot;Cox&#x27;s sandpiper&quot; (&quot;Calidris&quot; × &quot;paramelanotos&quot;) is a stereotyped hybrid between this species and the curlew sandpiper. This does not prove a particularly close relationship between these two species, as far more distantly related waders have successfully hybridized. In any case, among the stint clade the red-necked stint (&quot;&quot;C.&quot; ruficollis&quot;) and the long-toed stint (&quot;&quot;C.&quot; subminuta&quot;) are particularly close relatives of the pectoral sandpiper.

The scientific name is from Ancient Greek. The genus name &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, is a term used by Aristotle for some gray-colored waterside birds. The specific &quot;melanotos&quot; is from &quot;melas&quot;, &quot;black&quot; and &quot;notos&quot;, &quot;backed &quot;.

==Description==

This bird looks similar to the widely sympatric sharp-tailed sandpiper (&quot;&quot;C.&quot; acuminata&quot;), which is not a member of the stint clade however. The pectoral sandpiper is a largish calidrid ( in length, with a wingspan of ) with a grey-brown back, brownest in the summer male, and grayest in winter. The pectoral sandpiper has a grey breast, sharply demarcated at its lower edge, which gives this species its English name; this clear dividing line is particularly conspicuous if the birds are turned towards the observer. The legs are yellowish, and the bill is olive with a darker tip.

The juveniles are more brightly patterned above with rufous coloration and white mantle stripes.

This species differs from the sharp-tailed sandpiper in its breast pattern, weaker supercilium and grayer crown.

==Distribution and ecology==

It is a very long-distance migrant, and about half of the species breeds in the boggy tundra of northeast Asia, the rest nesting in a range from Alaska to central Canada. The American and most of the Asian birds winter in South America, but some Asian breeders winter in southern and Australia and New Zealand. On migration and in winter, the pectoral sandpiper is typically found in freshwater habitats.

This species also occurs as a regular migrant to western Europe, and is seen most years in Ireland or Great Britain. While the pectoral sandpiper has not been recorded as breeding species in Europe, vagrant individuals were found in Scotland in suitable breeding habitat during summer. Many of the birds occurring in Western Europe may be on a regular migration from Asian breeding grounds to winter in Southern Africa. September 2003 saw a record influx to those two countries, with 40 found in Ireland and 150 in Great Britain. On the US Pacific coast, such stagings of migrant flocks appear to be rarer. Vagrant individuals are sometimes seen elsewhere off the usual migration routes, e.g. on the Marianas, the Marshall Islands and Palau in Micronesia; they are somewhat more frequently encountered on the Hawaiian Islands.

The pectoral sandpiper&#x27;s migration might be affected by global warming, as is suspected for many Arctic-breeding birds: 100 years ago, migrating pectoral sandpipers were observed to pass through northern Ohio in early-mid May and again in late August; today, the bulk of the northward migration takes place in April already, and most birds do not return until mid-September.

These birds forage on grasslands and mudflats, picking up food by sight, sometimes by probing. They mainly eat arthropods (such as flies and their larvae, spiders and crustaceans) and other invertebrates, as well as seeds. The male has a courtship display which involves puffing up his breast, which has a fat sac in the breeding season to enhance his performance.

The pectoral sandpiper builds a steep-sided scrape nest with a considerable volume of lining material. The nest is deep enough that the eggs sit about below ground level, which helps to minimize heat loss from the cool breezes which occur at the latitudes where the species nests. The female lays four eggs.

Pectoral sandpipers have decreased in number 50% since 1974.

<doc id="383390" wikidata="Q514827" url="?curid=383390" title="Blood knot">
<text>A blood knot (barrel knot) is a bend knot most usefully employed for joining sections of monofilament nylon line while maintaining a high portion of the line&#x27;s inherent strength. Other knots used for this purpose can cause a substantial loss of strength. In fly fishing, this serves to build a leader of gradually decreasing diameter with the castable fly line attached at the large diameter end and the fly or hook at the small diameter end. The principal drawback to the blood knot is the dexterity required to tie it. It is also likely to jam, which is not a concern in fishing line, which is no great loss to cut, but may be a concern in normal rope. &quot;Blood knot&quot; may refer to &quot;a double overhand knot tied in a cat-o&#x27;-nine-tails.&quot;

A half blood knot (also clinch knot) is a knot that is used for securing a fishing line to a fishing lure, snap or swivel. When two half blood knots are used to join two lines they are considered as one knot and called a blood knot. A half blood knot is one of the strongest knots for tying a medium-size hook to a medium-size line such as hooksize 4 to 4/0 onto line size 6 lb to 30 lb.

==Tying the knot==

In tying the blood knot, the two lines to be joined are overlapped for 6–8 cm with the short ends of the two lines in opposite directions. The short end of one line is then wrapped 4–6 times around the second line and the remaining portion of the first short end brought back and passed between the lines at the beginning of the wraps. 
The short end of the second line is then wrapped 4–6 times around the first line and the end of this line brought back and passed through what is now an oval space between the first wrap of each set.
The above method has been called by Stanle Barnes (&quot;Anglers&#x27; Knots in Gut &amp; Nylon&quot;, 2nd ed., 1951) &quot;outcoil&quot;, and is contrasted with the method that resembles the finished knot from the start, &quot;incoil&quot;. In fishing line, and in other material if not deliberately set snug and maybe re-set after some initial tensioning, the outcoil form will transform into the incoil form.

The knot is tightened by moistening it and pulling on the long ends of the line. This causes the wraps to tighten and compress, creating two short sections of &quot;barrel&quot;, which look much like a hangman&#x27;s knot, that slide together. The short ends of the line are then trimmed close to the wraps, or one of the ends may be left intact to be used for a second fly or lure, called a &quot;dropper&quot;.

<doc id="383393" wikidata="Q5600099" url="?curid=383393" title="Great Triumvirate">
<text>In U.S. politics, the Great Triumvirate (known also as the Immortal Trio) refers to a triumvirate of three statesmen who dominated American politics for much of the first half of the 19th century, namely Henry Clay of Kentucky, Daniel Webster of Massachusetts, and John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. These men&#x27;s interactions in large part tell the story of politics under the Second Party System. All three were extremely active in politics, served at various times as Secretary of State, as Congressmen in the House of Representatives and served together as Senators in the Senate.

Clay, the oldest, emerged on the national political scene first, serving as counsel for Aaron Burr in his treason trial and serving two short stints in the Senate before being elected Speaker of the House of Representatives for the Twelfth Congress. Calhoun was a freshman member of this Congress and his friendship and ideological closeness with Clay helped propel him to prominence as a leader of the war hawk faction agitating for a war which would eventually be declared as the War of 1812. Webster was elected in 1813 to Congress and immediately became a leading anti-war and anti-administration Federalist. Webster wrangled with the nationalists Clay and Calhoun on post-war issues such as the chartering of the Second Bank of the United States and the Tariff of 1816. After the Fourteenth Congress, Calhoun became Secretary of War and Webster declined reelection to focus on his law practice in Boston, a practice which took him before the Supreme Court in landmark cases like &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot;, &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot;, and &quot;McCullouch v. Maryland&quot; in which he represented the Bank of the United States. 

The three were reunited in the Senate in 1832, with Calhoun&#x27;s resignation from the vice presidency and election to the Senate in the midst of the Nullification Crisis. The three would remain in the Senate until their deaths, with exceptions for Webster and Calhoun&#x27;s tenures as Secretary of State and Clay&#x27;s presidential campaigns in 1844 and 1848. The time these three men spent in the Senate represents a time of rising political pressure in the United States, especially on the matter of slavery. With each one representing the three major sections of the United States at that time and their respective mindsets (the Western settlers, the Northern businessmen, and the Southern slaveholders), the Great Triumvirate was responsible for symbolizing the opposing viewpoints of the American people and giving them a voice in the government. The debates leading to the Compromise of 1850 were the last major contribution of the three as they were eclipsed by a new generation of political leaders like Jefferson Davis, William H. Seward, and Stephen A. Douglas.

Calhoun was so ill at the time of the Senate debate on the Compromise that he was unable to deliver his fiery speech opposing it, instead having it read for him by James Mason while he sat in the chamber. Calhoun would die just two weeks later on March 31, 1850. Within three years, Clay and Webster would die as well.

<doc id="383395" wikidata="Q610242" url="?curid=383395" title="Battle of Rennell Island">
<text>The took place on 29–30 January 1943. It was the last major naval engagement between the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Guadalcanal Campaign of World War II. It occurred in the South Pacific between Rennell Island and Guadalcanal in the southern Solomon Islands.

In the battle, Japanese land-based torpedo bombers, seeking to provide protection for the impending evacuation of Japanese forces from Guadalcanal, made several attacks over two days on U.S. warships operating as a task force south of Rennell Island. In addition to approaching Guadalcanal with the objective of engaging any Japanese ships that might come into range, the U.S. task force was protecting an Allied transport ship convoy carrying replacement troops there.

As a result of the Japanese air attacks on the task force, one U.S. heavy cruiser was sunk, a destroyer was heavily damaged, and the rest of the U.S. task force was forced to retreat from the southern Solomons area. Partly because they turned back the U.S. task force in this battle, the Japanese successfully evacuated their remaining troops from Guadalcanal by 7 February 1943, leaving it in the hands of the Allies and ending the battle for the island.

==Background==

On 7 August 1942, Allied forces, consisting primarily of U.S. troops, landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.

The last major attempt by the Japanese to drive Allied forces from Guadalcanal and Tulagi was defeated during the decisive Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in early November 1942. Thereafter, the Japanese Navy was able to deliver only subsistence supplies and a few replacement troops to Japanese Army forces on Guadalcanal. Because of the threat from Allied aircraft based at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, plus nearby U.S. aircraft carriers, the Japanese delivered these supplies at night, usually by destroyer or submarine, in operations the Allies called the &quot;Tokyo Express.&quot; These supplies and replacements were not enough to sustain Japanese troops on the island, who by 7 December 1942, were losing about 50 men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. On 12 December 1942, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. Despite initial opposition from Army leaders, who still hoped that Guadalcanal could eventually be retaken from the Allies, on 31 December 1942 the Imperial General Headquarters, with approval from the Emperor, agreed to evacuate all Japanese forces from the island and establish a new line of defense for the Solomons on New Georgia.

The evacuation was code-named &quot;Operation Ke&quot; (ケ号作戦), and was scheduled to begin on 14 January 1943. An important element in the plan was an air superiority campaign starting 28 January 1943, to inhibit Allied aircraft or warships from disrupting the final stage of the &quot;Ke&quot; operation, which was the actual evacuation of all Japanese troops from Guadalcanal.

Allied forces misinterpreted the &quot;Ke&quot; preparations as the beginning of another Japanese offensive to try to retake Guadalcanal. At the same time, Admiral William Halsey Jr., the Allied theatre commander, was under pressure from his superiors to complete the replacement of the 2nd Marine Regiment, which had been in combat on Guadalcanal since August, with fresh U.S. Army troops. Halsey hoped to take advantage of what he believed was an impending Japanese offensive to draw Japanese naval forces into a battle, while at the same time delivering the replacement Army troops to Guadalcanal. On 29 January 1943, Halsey sent five task forces toward the southern Solomons area to cover the relief convoy and to engage any Japanese naval forces that came into range. These five task forces included two fleet carriers, two escort carriers, three battleships, 12 cruisers, and 25 destroyers.

Leading this array of task forces was Task Group 62.8, the troop convoy of four transports and four destroyers. Ahead of the troop convoy, between Rennell Island and Guadalcanal, was Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen&#x27;s Task Force 18 (TF 18), a close support group of heavy cruisers , , and , light cruisers , , and ; escort carriers and ; and eight destroyers. Giffen commanded TF 18 from &quot;Wichita&quot;. A fleet carrier task force—centered on the carrier —steamed about behind TG 62.8 and TF 18. The other fleet carrier and battleship task forces were about farther back. Giffen, with &quot;Wichita&quot; and the two escort carriers, had just arrived in the Pacific after participating in Operation Torch in the North African Campaign. Also, &quot;Chicago&quot; had just arrived back in the South Pacific, after completing repairs from damage suffered during the Battle of Savo Island almost six months before.

==Battle==

===Prelude===
In addition to protecting the troop convoy, TF 18 was charged with rendezvousing with a force of four U.S. destroyers, stationed at Tulagi, at 21:00 on 29 January in order to conduct a sweep up &quot;The Slot&quot; through New Georgia Sound north of Guadalcanal the next day to screen the unloading of the troop transports at Guadalcanal. The escort carriers, under Commodore Ben Wyatt, and travelling at , were too slow to allow Giffen&#x27;s force to make the scheduled rendezvous, so Giffen left the carriers behind with two destroyers at 14:00 and pushed on ahead at . Wary of the threat from Japanese submarines, which Allied intelligence indicated were likely in the area, Giffen arranged his cruisers and destroyers for anti-submarine defense, not expecting an air attack. The cruisers were aligned in two columns, spaced apart. &quot;Wichita&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, and &quot;Louisville&quot;, in that order, to starboard, and &quot;Montpelier&quot;, &quot;Cleveland&quot;, and &quot;Columbia&quot; to port. The six destroyers were in a semicircle ahead of the cruiser columns.

Giffen&#x27;s force was tracked by Japanese submarines, who reported its location and movement. Around mid-afternoon, based on the submarine reports, 16 Mitsubishi G4M Type 1 bombers from the 705 Air Group (Misawa Kōkūtai) and 16 Mitsubishi G3M Type 96 bombers from the 701 Air Group (Mihoro Kōkūtai) took off from Rabaul carrying torpedoes to attack Giffen&#x27;s force. One G3M turned back with engine trouble, leaving 31 bombers in the attack force. The leader of the 705AG aircraft was Lieutenant Tomoo Nakamura and Lieutenant Commander Joji Hagai commanded the 701AG planes.

===Action on 29 January===
At sunset, as TF 18 headed northwest north of Rennell Island and south of Guadalcanal, several of Giffen&#x27;s ships detected unidentified aircraft on radar west of their formation. Having previously insisted on absolute radio silence, Giffen gave no orders about what to do about the unidentified contacts, or any orders at all, for that matter. With the setting of the sun, TF 18&#x27;s combat air patrol (CAP) from the two escort carriers returned to their ships for the night, leaving Giffen&#x27;s ships without air cover.

The radar contacts were the approaching Japanese torpedo bombers, who circled around to the south of TF 18 so that they could attack from the east, with the black backdrop of the eastern sky behind them. From this direction, the Japanese bombers were hidden by the night sky, but Giffen&#x27;s ships were silhouetted against the twilight of the western horizon. The 705AG aircraft attacked first, beginning at 19:19. Nakamura&#x27;s aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen&#x27;s ships.

Believing the attack was over, Giffen ordered his ships to cease zigzagging and continue towards Guadalcanal on the same course and at the same speed. Meanwhile, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft began dropping flares and floatlights to mark the course and speed of TF 18 for the impending attack by Hagai&#x27;s bombers.

At 19:38, 701AG attacked, hitting &quot;Chicago&quot; with two torpedoes, causing heavy damage and bringing the cruiser to a dead stop. Another torpedo hit &quot;Wichita&quot; but did not explode. Two bombers were shot down by anti-aircraft fire, including Hagai&#x27;s; he was killed. At 20:08, Giffen ordered his ships to reverse direction, to slow to and to cease firing their anti-aircraft guns. The absence of muzzle flashes concealed the ships from the Japanese aircraft, who all departed the area by 23:35. In pitch darkness, &quot;Louisville&quot; managed to take the crippled &quot;Chicago&quot; under tow and slowly headed south, away from the battle area, escorted by the rest of TF 18.

===Action on 30 January===
Halsey immediately took steps to try to protect &quot;Chicago&quot;, notifying the escort carriers to make sure they had a CAP in place at first light, ordering the &quot;Enterprise&quot; task force to approach and to augment the escort carrier CAP, and sending the fleet tug to take over the tow from &quot;Louisville&quot;, which was achieved at 08:00. Between daybreak and 14:00, numerous Japanese scout aircraft approached TF 18. Although they were all chased away by the CAP, they observed and reported the position of &quot;Chicago&quot;. At 12:15, Lieutenant Commander Kazuo Nishioka led a force of 11 G4M torpedo bombers from the 751 Air Group (Kanoya Kōkūtai), based at Kavieng and staging through Buka, New Guinea, launched to attack the damaged U.S. cruiser. An Australian coastwatcher in the Solomon Islands warned the U.S. forces of the bombers and estimated their arrival time as 16:00. However, Halsey ordered the other cruisers to leave &quot;Chicago&quot; behind and head for Efate in the New Hebrides. They departed at 15:00, leaving behind six destroyers to protect &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Navajo&quot;.

At 15:40, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was away from &quot;Chicago&quot;, with ten of her fighters forming a CAP over the damaged cruiser. At this time, four of the CAP fighters chased and shot down a scouting G4M bomber. At 15:54, &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s radar detected the incoming bombers and launched 10 more fighters. The escort carriers, however, had difficulties in getting their aircraft launched and their aircraft did not attack the bombers until the engagement was over.
At first, the Japanese bombers appeared to be trying to approach and attack &quot;Enterprise&quot; but turned toward &quot;Chicago&quot; after six &quot;Enterprise&quot; CAP fighters began to engage them. Four other CAP fighters chased the 751AG aircraft as they entered the anti-aircraft fire from &quot;Chicago&quot;″s escorting destroyers. Two of the bombers were shot down before they could release their ordnance. Six more were shot down moments later, but not before they dropped their torpedoes.

One torpedo hit the destroyer in her forward engine room, killing 22 of her crew and causing heavy damage. &quot;Chicago&quot; was hit by four torpedoes, one forward of the bridge and three others in her engineering spaces. Captain Ralph O. Davis of &quot;Chicago&quot; ordered the ship to be abandoned, and she sank, stern first, 20 minutes later. &quot;Navajo&quot; and the escorting destroyers rescued 1,049 survivors from &quot;Chicago&quot;, but 62 of her crew died. A final attack force of Japanese torpedo bombers failed to find the remaining U.S. ships. &quot;Navajo&quot; took &quot;La Vallette&quot; under tow, and all of the remaining ships of TF 18 made port at Espiritu Santo without further incident.

==Aftermath==
The Japanese widely publicized the results of the engagement, claiming to have sunk a battleship and three cruisers. The U.S. on the other hand, tried to conceal the loss of &quot;Chicago&quot; from the public for some time, with Admiral Chester Nimitz threatening to &quot;shoot&quot; any of his staff who leaked the loss of &quot;Chicago&quot; to the press. Halsey and Nimitz blamed Giffen for the defeat and wrote this in Giffen&#x27;s official performance report for the period. The defeat and resulting recriminations did not affect Giffen&#x27;s career; he continued to lead Allied battleship and cruiser task forces in the Pacific until 1944 and was later promoted to vice admiral.

With Japanese aircraft engaged with TF 18, the Allied transports completed their mission of replacing the remaining marines on Guadalcanal over the last two days in January 1943. During this time, the other Allied task forces, including the two fleet carrier task forces, took station in the Coral Sea, in anticipation of an expected Japanese offensive in the southern Solomons.

With TF 18 forced to retreat, very few Allied naval forces were left in the immediate Guadalcanal area, allowing the Japanese to retrieve most of their remaining ground forces from Guadalcanal over three nights between 2 and 7 February 1943. This left any remaining Allied ships in the area highly exposed to Japanese attacks. Because the Allies believed that the Japanese were not evacuating, but actually sending in more reinforcements, U.S. destroyers and troop transports were proceeding with normal amphibious operations in western Guadalcanal despite losing the heavy firepower of TF 18. The destroyer was sunk by Japanese planes with 167 men killed and the destroyer was slightly damaged and suffered two killed. Three PT boats, &quot;PT-37&quot;, &quot;PT-111&quot;, and &quot;PT-123&quot;, were sunk by Japanese forces on the same day as the sinking of &quot;De Haven&quot; with the loss of 15 sailors. The Allies were not aware of the Japanese withdrawal until it was over, but the evacuation of 11,000 starving troops and the loss of one cruiser became a footnote to the securing of Henderson Field and Guadalcanal, which provided the air support springboard to successfully complete the Solomon Islands campaign, a major turning point in the Pacific War.

<doc id="383398" wikidata="Q2100791" url="?curid=383398" title="Point Reyes National Seashore">
<text>Point Reyes National Seashore is a park preserve located on the Point Reyes Peninsula in Marin County, California. As a national seashore, it is maintained by the US National Park Service as an important nature preserve. No other park in the world hosts breeding hoofed megafauna (elk) and marine megafauna (elephant and other seals). Some existing agricultural uses are allowed to continue within the park. Clem Miller, a US Congressman from Marin County, wrote and introduced the bill for the establishment of Point Reyes National Seashore in 1962 to protect the peninsula from development which was proposed at the time for the slopes above Drake&#x27;s Bay. About half of the national seashore is protected as wilderness.

==Geography ==
The Point Reyes peninsula is a well defined area, geologically separated from the rest of Marin County and almost all of the continental United States by a rift zone of the San Andreas Fault, about half of which is sunk below sea level and forms Tomales Bay. The peninsula is part of the Salinian Block while across the fault is the Franciscan Complex; the difference in soil composition affects the mix of flora on either side of the fault.

The small town of Point Reyes Station, while not located on the peninsula, provides most services to it. Some services are also available at Inverness on the west shore of Tomales Bay. The small town of Olema, about south of Point Reyes Station, serves as the gateway to the Seashore and its visitor center.

The peninsula includes wild coastal beaches and headlands, estuaries, and uplands. Parts of the park are private farms and ranches which have commercial cattle grazing. These were leased back when the park was purchased to continue these historic uses. Other parts are under the jurisdiction of other conservation authorities with the National Park Service providing signage and managing visitor impact on the entire peninsula and Tomales Bay. The Seashore also administers the parts of the Golden Gate National Recreation area, such as the Olema Valley, that are adjacent to the Seashore.

== Wildlife and ecology ==
Point Reyes National Seashore lies at the convergence of two marine ecological provinces (southern Oregonian and northern Californian) and harbors 45% of North America&#x27;s bird species and 18% of California&#x27;s plant species. The National Seashore&#x27;s of coastline include estuaries, bays and lagoons which provide rich habitats including subtidal seagrasses, tidal mudflats and marshes that support a rich diversity of wildlife. There are at least 42 rare and endangered plants of the more than 850 plant species identified. Almost 40 species of land mammals plus a dozen marine mammals such as the harbor seal live or through this area. Bird species counts are well over 400.

It is part of the Golden Gate Biosphere Network, recognized in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves.

===Fauna===
Until recently, the northernmost part of the peninsula, Tomales Point, was maintained as a reserve for tule elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis nannodes&quot;), a species historically native to the region. Although they had been completely extirpated from Point Reyes by the nineteenth century, in 1978, ten tule elk were reintroduced to Point Reyes from the San Luis National Wildlife Refuge near Los Banos. By 2009, the population climbed to over 440 elk at Tomales Point&#x27;s of coastal scrub and grasslands. In 1999, 100 elk from Tomales Point were moved to the Limantour wilderness area of the Seashore and above Drakes Beach to Ranch A, as that ranch&#x27;s long-term lease expired and was not renewed. The drought in 2012–2015 was also a threat to the elk confined north of the fence on Tomales Point, with nearly half the elk there dying from lack of water. In 2012 there were 540 elk, then only 357 in 2013, and by 2014 only 286. In August and September 2020, drought and wildfires again threaten the Tomales Point elk, leading some conservationists to illegally bring water to the elk north of the fence. The Park Service began a public review and comment period in 2023 on a proposal remove of the tule elk fence with a final decision expected in the summer of 2024. In December, 2024 the Tomales Point fence was breached by the National Park Service, allowing the confined elk herds to roam freely through the park. Then, in January, 2025 a deal brokered by The Nature Conservancy led to a buy-out of most of the peninsula&#x27;s ranchers, reducing the number of cattle from about 10,000 to 200 over the next 1.5 years, and returning most of the park to wilderness status.

The preserve is also very rich in raptors and shorebirds. The western snowy plover that nests here is considered &quot;threatened&quot; under the Endangered Species Act.

The Point Reyes Lighthouse attracts whale-watchers looking for the gray whale migrating south in mid-January and north in mid-March.

When Elephant seals (&quot;Mirounga angustirostris&quot;) established a rookery in 1981, Point Reyes National Seashore became the only park in the world with breeding ungulates and pinnipeds. The first elephant seal breeding colony was established at Chimney Beach, which is protected by cliffs, although the first documented pup was born at Point Reyes in 1976. In January 2019, during the federal government shutdown, park rangers were not working and the seals had pups on Drakes Beach and its parking lot. Small-group tours to view the seals from the edge of the parking lot began the following month after the shutdown ended. Docents help keep the public safe during the winter months as the colony continues to grow each year.

=== Flora ===
Point Reyes lies within the California interior chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. The Point Reyes area has more than 50 species of rare, threatened or endangered plants. Perennial wildflowers include the yellow larkspur (&quot;Delphinium luteum&quot;), federally listed as endangered, and state listed as rare since 1979. It has yellow flowers that bloom from March through May, grows in plant communities of coastal scrub, and is extremely poisonous (major toxicity class 1 ). Rare grasses include the endemic Sonoma shortawn foxtail (&quot;Alopecurus aequalis&quot; var. &quot;sonomensis&quot;) in the family Poaceae, federally listed as endangered since 1997. The California Native Plant Society lists this subspecies population as seriously endangered, and that more taxonomic information is needed.

In his book &quot;The Natural History of the Point Reyes Peninsula&quot;, Jules Evens identifies several plant communities. One of the most prominent is the Coastal Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;) forest, which includes Coast live oak, Tanoak, and California bay and reaches across the southern half of Inverness Ridge toward Bolinas Lagoon. Unlogged parts of this Douglas-fir forest contain trees over 300 years old and up to in diameter. But despite these large, old trees, the forest may nevertheless be a result of European settlement. The Coast Miwok people who once lived in the area set frequent fires to clear brush and increase game animal populations, and early explorers&#x27; accounts describe the hills as bare and grassy. But as the Native American settlements were replaced by European ones from the seventeenth century onward, the forests expanded as fire frequency decreased, resulting in the forests we see today.

The Bishop pine (&quot;Pinus muricata&quot;) forest is found on slopes in the northern half of the park. Many of these trees growing in thick swaths came from seeds released after the 1995 Mt. Vision fire. The bishop pines of the Phillip Burton Wilderness are considered an intermediate between the northern variety (&quot;Pinus muricata&quot; v. &quot;borealis&quot;) and the southern (&quot;Pinus muricata&quot; v. &quot;muricata&quot;). The Monterey cypress (&quot;Callitropsis macrocarpa&quot;), a closed-cone conifer, is also present.

Salt, brackish, and freshwater marshlands are found adjacent to Drakes Estero and Abbotts Lagoon. The other communities identified by Evens are the coastal strand, dominated by European beach grass (&quot;Ammophila arenaria&quot;), ice plant (&quot;Carprobrotus edulis&quot;, also called sea fig or Hottentot fig), sea rocket (&quot;Cakile maritima&quot;) and other species that thrive on the immediate coast; northern coastal prairie, found on a narrow strip just inland from the coastal strand that includes some native grasses; coastal rangeland, the area still grazed by the cattle from the peninsula&#x27;s remaining working ranches; northern coastal scrub, dominated by coyote bush (&quot;Baccharis pilularis&quot;); and the intertidal and subtidal plant communities.

Point Reyes is home to the only known population of the endangered Sonoma spineflower, &quot;Chorizanthe valida&quot;.
===Cattle ranches===
The park has of dairy and beef cattle ranching. Extremely high levels of fecal coliform bacteria (&quot;Escherichia coli&quot;) concentrations have been documented in streams adjacent to existing dairy operations. Cattle manure spreading areas are correlated with the increased presence of invasive and noxious weed species. Tomales Bay, Drakes Estero and Abbotts Lagoon are all affected by E. coli discharges from cattle operations in rainy winter months. A joint inspection in 2022 by the Marin County Environmental Health Services and the National Park Service found the ranches were discharging raw sewage either through leaks or missing septic systems.

==Landmarks and facilities==

The Point Reyes Lifeboat Station is a National Historic Landmark. It is the last remaining example of a rail-launched lifeboat station that was common on the Pacific coast.

Nova Albion, Francis Drake&#x27;s 1579 campsite; Sebastião Rodrigues Soromenho&#x27;s 1595 wreck; and fifteen associated Native American sites are included in the Drakes Bay Historic and Archaeological District National Historic Landmark. This encompasses along the coast of Drakes Bay.

Kule Loklo, a re-created Coast Miwok village, is a short walk from the visitor center.

Lairds Landing was the site of a wharf on the southwest shore of Tomales Bay. It was named after ranchers, Charles and George Laird, who leased the site in 1858 to transport supplies and produce across the bay. The location was settled by the Felix family around 1861, a family of Filipino and Miwok heritage. After the descendants of the Felix family left in 1955, the land was zoned for development, then made part of the Point Reyes National Seashore, before becoming home to artist Clayton Lewis. In 2015, structures built by the Felix family were placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Point Reyes National Seashore attracts 2.5 million visitors annually. Hostelling International USA (part of Hostelling International) maintains a 45-bed youth hostel at the Seashore.

The Point Reyes National Seashore Association, formed in 1964, collaborates with the Seashore on maintenance, restoration and educational projects.

=== Wilderness ===
More than of the Point Reyes National Seashore are designated as the Phillip Burton Wilderness, named in honor of California Congressman Phillip Burton, who wrote the legislation creating the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and was instrumental in helping to pass the California Wilderness Act of 1984. The US Congress passed legislation (Public Law 94-544) in 1976 that created the Point Reyes Wilderness, and in 1985, Congress, in recognition of Burton&#x27;s dedication to wilderness preservation, renamed the wilderness after him (P.L. 99-68). It is one of only three designated wilderness areas along the California coast, the others being the King Range Wilderness and the Rocks and Islands Wilderness.

There are three separate sections:

The southeastern area protects the Inverness Ridge down to a long coastline and is the largest unit. Within this area are forests of Douglas fir and California buckeye, coastal foothills, terraces, caves, beaches, several small inland lakes and the high point of Mount Wittenberg. The four trailcamps are in this section, with Wildcat and Coast camps located near shore, and Sky and Glen camps inland. Each camp has a different number of individual sites, with 52 sites total and four group sites.

The central section, which is separated from the southeastern unit by Limantour Road, protects the crest of the Inverness Ridge, the east shore of Estero de Limantour and the Limantour Spit. An endemic (restricted to one area) and rare coastal pine known as the Bishop pine grows here.

The north segment includes the Tomales Point area, which is an open grassland peninsula that separates the Pacific Ocean to the west from the Tomales Bay, a submerged valley, on the east. A reserve for the reintroduced tule elk is in this section. Although there are no trailcamps, boat-in camping is allowed on Tomales Bay.

===Hiking===

Point Reyes has a system of about 150 miles of hiking trails for day hiking and backpacking. Bear Valley Trail is the most popular hike in the park. It travels mostly streamside through a shaded, fern-laden canyon, breaking out at Divide Meadow before heading downward to the coast, where it emerges at Arch Rock. A portion of Arch Rock collapsed on March 21, 2015, killing one person. 
Three trails connecting from the west with the Bear Valley trail head upward toward Mount Wittenberg, at , the highest point in the park. The Earthquake Trail, a loop that runs over the San Andreas Fault. The trail provides descriptions of the fault and the surrounding geology, and features a fence that was pulled apart during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

At the western end of the Point Reyes Peninsula is the historic Point Reyes Lighthouse, reached by descending 308 steps. Unlike many lighthouses, that were built high so the light could be seen by ships far out to sea, the Point Reyes lighthouse was built low to get the light below the fog that is so prevalent in the area. Nearby is the short Chimney Rock hike, which is noted for its spring wildflower displays.

Point Reyes offers several beach walks. Limantour Spit winds up on a narrow sandy beach, from which Drakes Beach can be glimpsed across Drakes Bay. North Beach and South Beach are often windswept and wave-pounded. Ocean vistas from higher ground can be seen from the Tomales Point Trail and, to the south, from the Palomarin trailhead at the park&#x27;s southern entrance outside the town of Bolinas. All of the park&#x27;s beaches were listed as the cleanest in the state in 2010.

For backpackers, Point Reyes has four hike-in campgrounds available by reservation.

Point Reyes is a terminus of the American Discovery Trail which is the only transcontinental trail in the United States.

===Marine Protected Areas===
Point Reyes State Marine Reserve &amp; Point Reyes State Marine Conservation Area, Estero de Limantour State Marine Reserve &amp; Drakes Estero State Marine Conservation Area and Duxbury Reef State Marine Conservation Area adjoin Point Reyes National Seashore. These marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

===Oyster farm===
A large oyster farm was located in Drakes Estero until, under court order, it closed down at end of 2014. Court appeals to keep the operation in place were dropped in December, 2014.

The farm was purchased by the National Park Service in 1972, and the agency issued a permit to allow the previous owner to continue operations for 40 years. The business was sold to a new owner in 2004, the Drakes Bay Oyster Company, who was informed by the NPS at the time of purchase that their permit to operate would not be renewed beyond the November 30, 2012 expiration date. A federal law enacted in 2009 authorized, but did not require, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to renew the permit. The NPS and conservation groups viewed the farm as an inappropriate and environmentally-insensitive use of the estero, which was designated a &quot;potential wilderness area&quot; by Congress. The farm&#x27;s supporters argued that it was not ecologically harmful and was important to the local economy.

On November 29, 2012, Salazar announced that he would not renew the permit, citing the original intent of the Point Reyes Wilderness Act to designate the area as wilderness upon the removal of the oyster farm. Salazar visited the farm the previous week and later personally phoned the farm&#x27;s owner to give him the news.

The oyster farm closure was challenged in U.S. District Court on January 25, 2013. The challenge was rejected by a federal court judge, who ruled that the law gave Salazar unfettered discretion to approve or deny a renewal of the permit. The California Coastal Commission voted on February 7, 2013 to unanimously approve cease and desist and restoration orders for violations of the California Coastal Act. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected an appeal of the district court&#x27;s decision, ruling on Sept. 3, 2013 that the oyster farm&#x27;s owner had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits because Salazar had acted within his discretion in denying the permit. An attempt to have the appeals court rehear the case was rejected on January 14, 2014 and a petition to the United States Supreme Court was denied on June 30, 2014. The oyster farm closed its on site retail operation on July 31, 2014. However, controversy continued over the condition of the estero sea floor and the ongoing off shore operations. Another lawsuit challenging the closure itself was rejected in September 2014.

The work to remove the offshore racks and onshore buildings was completed in May 2017; of debris had been hauled away. The estero is part of the Phillip Burton Wilderness.

<text>Mercury-Atlas 5 was an American spaceflight of the Mercury program. It was launched on November 29, 1961, with Enos, a chimpanzee, aboard. The craft orbited the Earth twice and splashed down about south of Bermuda, and Enos became the first primate from the United States and the third great ape to orbit the Earth.

==History==
By November 1961, the Soviet Union had launched Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov into orbit during the Vostok 1 and Vostok 2 crewed orbital flights while the United States had managed only suborbital ones. At that time NASA was still debating placing a chimpanzee in orbit as part of the Mercury-Atlas subprogram, with NASA headquarters questioning the wisdom of the Manned Spacecraft Center launching another uncrewed Mercury mission. 

The NASA Public Affairs Office issued a press release prior to the flight, stating &quot;The men in charge of Project Mercury have insisted on orbiting the chimpanzee as a necessary preliminary checkout of the entire Mercury program before risking a human astronaut.&quot;

==Launch and orbit==

The flight used Mercury capsule #9 and Atlas #93-D. On February 24, 1961, spacecraft # 9 arrived at Cape Canaveral. It took 40 weeks of preflight preparation. This was the longest preparation time in the Mercury program. The mission of spacecraft #9 kept changing. It was first configured for a suborbital instrumented flight, then for a suborbital chimpanzee flight, then a three-orbit instrumented mission, and finally for the orbital flight that Enos flew.

MA-4&#x27;s successful flight in September had renewed confidence in the Atlas&#x27;s reliability. Seven Atlas launches since September, including four failures, were reviewed for any items of interest but most were not of concern to Mercury. Atlas 32E, also carrying a monkey on a biological mission, experienced a sustainer shutdown and was destroyed by Range Safety action shortly after liftoff on November 10 but the failure was due to an improperly installed component that was not of concern to the more tightly supervised Mercury program. Only MIDAS 4 was a possible problem as it experienced a flight control system malfunction--a week before MA-5&#x27;s flight, SAMOS 4 had a similar fault that resulted in failure to attain orbit and the exact cause of these failures was still under investigation when MA-5 launched.

Although MA-4 had performed well, there was still some concern about high vibration levels during the first 20 seconds of liftoff, so the autopilot on MA-5&#x27;s booster was modified slightly to correct this problem.

Atlas 93D arrived at CCAS on August 12 and was erected on LC-14 on October 6. Prelaunch preparation proceeded relatively smoothly, with a number of minor repairs, including a potentially serious problem with the vernier engines not being bolted in place tightly, which could have resulted in damage to the airframe during launch.

The Range Safety system on Atlas 93D was modified so that a manual cutoff command could be sent to the sustainer engine. This was to prevent the capsule from being accidentally boosted into a higher than planned orbit if engine over-acceleration occurred.

A more compact all-solid state telemetry unit replaced the bulky vacuum tube-based package used previously.

Atlas 93D was the second D-series Atlas to contain the new SMRD (Spin Motor Rotation Detection System), designed to ensure proper gyroscope operation prior to launch.

MA-5 was planned as a close approximation of the upcoming MA-6 crewed orbital mission. Mercury-Atlas 5 would be launched from Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral on a heading 72.51 degrees east of north. Orbital insertion of the Mercury spacecraft would occur from Cape Canaveral. The altitude would be and the speed would be . Retrofire was planned to take place at 4 hours, 32 minutes, and 26 seconds after launch. The spacecraft would land 21 minutes and 49 seconds after retrofire. Reentry temperatures were expected to reach on the heatshield, on the antenna housing, on the cylindrical section, and on the conical section. The spent Atlas sustainer engine was expected to reenter the atmosphere after 9⅓ orbits.

Spacecraft #9 had originally been intended to fly on MA-4, but Spacecraft #8 was used instead after having been recycled from the failed MA-3 launch. #9 was the second of the &quot;Mark II&quot; Mercury capsules with a larger square window and explosive bolt hatch, while the older &quot;Mark I&quot; capsule had small port windows and a heavy locking mechanism. Gus Grissom&#x27;s flight on MR-4 had used a Mark II capsule, but it was necessary to test it on a proper orbital mission to ensure that the large window could handle the much higher heat of reentry there.

On October 29, 1961, three chimpanzees and 12 medical specialists moved into quarters at the Cape to prepare for the flight. The name given to Enos, the chimpanzee selected to fly the MA-5 mission, in Hebrew means &quot;man&quot;. Enos&#x27;s backups were (in order of possible call-up) Duane, Jim, Rocky, and Ham (the Mercury-Redstone 2 veteran). Enos was from Cameroon, Africa (originally called Chimp # 81), and was purchased by the USAF on April 3, 1960. He was about 5 years old at the time of flight and weighed just under 40 pounds (18 kilograms).

On November 29, 1961, about five hours before launch, Enos and his spacesuit-couch were inserted in the spacecraft. During the countdown, various holds took 2 hours and 38 minutes. Liftoff came at 15:08 UTC. The Atlas launched the MA-5 spacecraft into an orbit of . The modified autopilot apparently worked as vibration remained within comfortable levels and the boost phase was uneventful. All Atlas systems performed excellently and there were no performance deviations of any significance. BECO occurred at T+130 seconds and SECO/VECO at T+300 seconds, followed by capsule separation two seconds later.

The turnaround and damping maneuver consumed of the of control fuel aboard. The spacecraft used less fuel than the MA-4 did during the same maneuver. MA-5 assumed its planned 34-degree orbital attitude and after that, through the first orbit the thrusters used only of fuel to maintain a correct position.

At the end of the first orbit, ground controllers noticed the capsule clock was 18 seconds too fast. As it passed over Cape Canaveral a command was sent to update the clock to the correct time. The Mercury Control Center at Cape Canaveral received information that all spacecraft systems were in good condition.

As the MA-5 passed over the Atlantic tracking ship at the beginning of the second orbit, indications were received that inverter temperatures were rising. The environmental control system malfunction was also confirmed by Canary Island trackers. Abnormal heating had occurred on earlier flights; in such cases, inverters had continued working or had been switched to standby. There was no alarm at Mercury Control. When the spacecraft reached Muchea, Australia, high thruster signals and capsule motion excursions were detected. Other data indicated that the 34° orbit mode was being maintained. When the MA-5 crossed the tracking station at Woomera, Australia, attitude control problems were not detected, so earlier reports were discounted.

===Problems===
As the MA-5 capsule reached the Canton Island station, Mercury Control realized that the attitude control system was malfunctioning. A metal chip in a fuel supply line had caused one of the clockwise roll thrusters to fail. The failed thruster allowed the spacecraft to drift from its normal attitude. This drift caused the automatic stabilization and control system to correct the spacecraft attitude. The spacecraft would swing back into the normal 34° orbital attitude, and the sequence would start again. The spacecraft repeated this drift and correction process nine times before retrofire. It did it once more between retrofire and the receipt of the 0.05 &quot;g&quot; (0.49 m/s²) light telemetry signal. The remaining thrusters used of fuel to keep the spacecraft properly aligned during the second orbit. Each loss of attitude cost over of fuel as compared with the entire first orbit consumption of only .

In addition to the attitude control problems, the environmental control system started having problems during the second orbit. The couch-suit circuit temperature rapidly rose from . This was an indication that the heat exchanger was freezing. The rise in suit temperature caused Enos&#x27; body temperature to rise to , then to . The medical observers began to worry about the chimpanzee&#x27;s condition. At , his body temperature stabilized. This indicated that the environmental system had started to function again. The cooling system seemed to correct itself, but the attitude problems continued.

As the spacecraft neared Hawaii on its second orbit, medical monitors were willing to let Enos continue the flight for a third orbit. However, the engineering team were concerned about the stuck thruster causing high fuel consumption, so they advised terminating the flight before the capsule ran out of attitude control gas.

Flight Director Christopher Kraft alerted the Hawaii controllers to be ready to initiate retrofire to bring the spacecraft down in the Pacific, if necessary. He also alerted controllers at Point Arguello, California, to be ready to initiate retrofire as MA-5 passed over their position. He allowed the spacecraft to continue to its normal second orbit retrofire position near California. Twelve seconds before the retrofire point was reached for the normal second-orbit Atlantic primary recovery point, Kraft decided to bring Enos back to Earth. Arnold Aldrich, the chief flight controller at Point Arguello, executed the command.

There was one more attitude control excursion early in reentry; after that, the rest of reentry and recovery were uneventful. The destroyers and and a P5M aircraft were waiting for the spacecraft at Station 8, the predicted landing point. Three hours and 13 minutes after launch and nine minutes before splashdown, the aircraft spotted the spacecraft at an altitude of descending on its main parachute, about 250 miles south of Bermuda. The information was relayed to &quot;Stormes&quot; and &quot;Compton&quot;, who were away. The spacecraft recovery aids were all functioning, except for the SARAH beacon. During the descent, the aircraft continued to circle and report landing events. It remained in the area until &quot;Stormes&quot; arrived, an hour and 15 minutes after the landing. &quot;Stormes&quot; hauled Enos and his spacecraft aboard. On the deck of &quot;Stormes&quot;, the MA-5 hatch was blown explosively. It was released from outside the capsule by pulling a lanyard. Blowing the hatch caused the spacecraft &quot;picture&quot; window to crack.

==Post-landing==

The spacecraft and Enos were both found to have survived the mission in good condition, although the chimpanzee had removed all of the medical electrodes and the urine collection device from his body.

On November 4, 1962, Enos died of dysentery caused by shigellosis, which was resistant to antibiotics of the time. He had been under constant observation for two months before his death. Pathologists at Holloman reported that they found no symptom that could be attributed or related to his space flight a year before.

The Mercury spacecraft and Atlas booster had now been qualified to carry a human into orbit.

<text>The Brunei dollar (sign: B$, Malay: &quot;ringgit Brunei&quot;, currency code: &quot;BND&quot;), has been the currency of the Sultanate of Brunei since 1967. It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively B$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. The currency is divided into 100 cents (Malay: sen) and is issued by the Brunei Darussalam Central Bank.

Under a Currency Interchangeability Agreement in 1967, the Brunei dollar is interchangeable with the Singapore dollar at par. As such, the Brunei dollar is accepted in Singapore as &quot;customary tender&quot;; likewise, the Singapore dollar is accepted in Brunei.

==History==

Early currency in Brunei included cowrie shells. Brunei is also famous for its bronze teapots, which were used as currency in barter trade along the coast of northern Borneo. The Spanish-American silver dollar brought over by the Manila galleons was in wide use for Brunei&#x27;s international trade from the 16th to 19th centuries; the 19th century Straits dollar was itself derived from the same coin.

Brunei issued tin coins denominated in pitis in AH1285 (AD1868). These were followed by a one cent coin in AH1304 (AD1888). This cent was one hundredth of a Straits dollar.

As a protectorate of Britain in the early 20th century, Brunei used the Straits dollar from 1906, the Malayan dollar from 1939 and the Malaya and British Borneo dollar from 1953 until 1967, when it began issuing its own currency.

The Brunei dollar replaced the Malaya and British Borneo dollar in 1967 after the formation of Malaysia and the independence of Singapore. Until 23 June 1973, the Malaysian ringgit was exchangeable at par with the Singapore dollar and Brunei dollar. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Brunei Currency and Monetary Board (now the Authoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (Monetary Authority of Brunei Darussalam)) still maintain the exchangeability of their two currencies. The dollar is accepted as &quot;customary tender&quot; in Singapore according to the Currency Interchangeability Agreement, although it is not legal tender there.

===History of coins used in Brunei===
Coins were used in Brunei from the 10th century. The Straits dollar was also used in Brunei from 1906.

Due to the close ties between China and Brunei, the first type of coins used in Brunei were Chinese coins. This was initially called &#x27;Pitis&#x27;. They were later known as &#x27;Kue&#x27; when local &#x27;Pitis&#x27; were introduced. The local &#x27;Pitis&#x27; coins had &#x27;Sultanate of Brunei&#x27; stamped in front of the coin and the royal umbrella was imprinted at the back. These were issued from the 16th to the 19th century. Previous Islamic coins were also called the &#x27;Pitis&#x27;. Another type of coin that was used in Brunei were &#x27;Duit besi&#x27; (which roughly translates to &#x27;Iron money&#x27;). Iron was considered valuable those days that it was used as money. 100 one-square inch pieces were valued at 1 dollar.

The last coin to be issued before the introduction of the Straits Settlements currency was the &#x27;Duit Bintang&#x27;, otherwise known as the &#x27;Star coin&#x27; or the &#x27;Star Cent&#x27;. It is called the Star coin because of the star imprinted on the obverse of the coin. It was minted in Birmingham, England, in 1887. It was made from copper.

With the introduction of the Straits Settlements currency, the previously used coins were taken out of circulation. They were, however still used with certain exchange rates.

Prior to 1984, the coins were made by the Royal Mint of the United Kingdom.

In 1984, Brunei Currency Board ordered four million circulation coins from the Singapore Mint. The circulation coins consisted of one cent coint in bronze and five, ten, twenty and fifty cents coins in cupro-nickel. The 50 cents has an additional security feature with a reeded edge with dots between lines at regular interval while other countries&#x27; circulation coins are mill-edged.

===History of banknotes used in Brunei===
The Straits dollar was introduced in Brunei in 1906. It was later replaced by the Malayan dollar which was introduced to British colonies and Brunei in 1939. It replaced the Straits dollar at par with a 1:1 exchange rate. The Malayan dollar was issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya. The board stopped issuing the Malayan dollar during the Japanese invasion during World War II. The Malayan dollar had the portrait of King George VI in front of the note.

In 1952, the board was renamed the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo. The board then began to issue notes to Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, British North Borneo, and Brunei in 1953. This was known as the Malaya and British Borneo dollar. 
In 1967, the Malaya and British Borneo dollar was replaced by three new currencies: the Malaysian dollar, Singapore dollar and the Brunei dollar, all at par. The Interchangeability Agreement which the three countries adhered to as original members of the currency union meant the Brunei dollar was exchangeable at par with the Singapore dollar and Malaysian dollar. This ended on 8 May 1973, when the Malaysian government withdrew from the agreement. 

The Singapore dollar is still interchangeable with the Brunei dollar today.

==Coins==

In 1967, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents. Except for the bronze 1 cent, the coins were struck in cupro-nickel. 

In 1986, copper-clad steel replaced bronze. Later, in 2008, the 1 cent coins switched compositions to brass.

==Banknotes==

On 12 June 1967, the government (&quot;Kerajaan Brunei&quot;) introduced notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 dollars. Notes for 500 and 1,000 dollars followed in 1979. In 1989, the title on the paper money was changed to &quot;Negara Brunei Darussalam&quot;, the official name of the country, and the Malay term for &quot;State of Brunei, Abode of Peace&quot;. 10,000 dollar notes were introduced the same year. All notes bear the denomination in Malay (in both Rumi and Jawi) and in English. The English denomination appeared on the obverse below the denomination in Malay on the earlier series, but now appears on the reverse together with the Jawi.

Five series of notes have been issued. The colours of $1, $5, and $10 notes have been the same for all the series of banknotes. 

===1967 series===

First series (1967) – currency with the portrait of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin III, the 28th ruler of Brunei.
* $1 – blue
* $5 – green
* $10 – red
* $50 – brown
* $100 – purple

===1972 series===

Second series – This series was the same as the first series with exception that the portrait of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin was replaced by the portrait of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the 29th and current ruler of Brunei. All subsequent currency has the portrait of Hassanal Bolkiah. In addition, two new higher denominations were issued in 1979.
* $1 ~ $100 like 1967 series
* $500 – pink
* $1,000 – yellow

===1989 series===

Third series – the post independence series. This series was gradually being replaced by the fourth series.
* $1 – blue
* $5 – green
* $10 – red
* $50 – brown, green, orange
* $100 – purple
* $500 – orange
* $1,000 – red-violet, purple, olive
* $10,000 – green, orange

===1996–2000 polymer and paper series===

Fourth Series (1996–2000) all notes except for the polymer issues are no longer printed.
=== 2004–2007 (polymer) series ===

Polymer banknotes were introduced in (2004) due to high cases of banknote forgery. All of them are polymer. The $100 note of this series has won a gold medal award for its security features in the 22nd National Print Award in Australia in May 2005.
The S$10,000 and B$10,000 notes are the world&#x27;s most valuable banknotes, (worth US$7,375 as of May 2024) that are officially in circulation. They are worth eight times as much as the next most valuable, the 1,000 Swiss franc note (US$1,100). From 6 November 2020, AMBD has announced it will stop printing B$10,000 notes to reduce the risk of money laundering. Brunei has also stopped the issuance of B$10,000 and is in the process of withdrawing it from active circulation.

===2011 polymer series===
* $1 – blue (2011)
* $5 – green and yellow (2011)
* $10 – red, yellow and brown (2011)
: To commemorate the 65th birthday of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. Shortly after the notes were issued, the Braille dots on the upper left front corner of the new polymer notes are not raised. The Braille dots cannot be felt tactilely, and they are not accurately rendered as Braille numbers corresponding to the denominations. Specifically, the spacing of the dots is wrong, and they lack the lead-in character that indicates that numbers follow.

===Commemorative banknotes===

* $25 – purple and beige (1992)
:This was issued during the silver jubilee (25th anniversary) of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah acceding to the throne. The design is of the 1989 series of currency.

* $20 – yellow (polymer, 2007)
:On 27 June 2007, Singapore and Brunei celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Currency Interchangeability Agreement (since 12 June 1967) by joint-issuing commemorative $20 notes.

:The two authorities issue distinct versions of the new $20 notes. They are both yellow, 149 × 72 mm in size, and made of polymer. The reverses are almost identical except that the Brunei version has their state title in Jawi script, while the Singaporean version has the state title of Brunei in Latin script. The obverse of the Singaporean version is similar to the current Portrait Series, whereas the obverse of the Brunei version is similar to the $50 and $100 of the 2004 series.

:There is a limited edition set, which consists of both versions in a folder, with matching serial number. The notes have &quot;40th Anniversary Currency Interchangeability Agreement&quot; overprinted on obverse. In addition, the Singaporean version has the two countries&#x27; state crests above the commemorative text. Only 12,000 sets are available, 10,000 from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and 2,000 from the Brunei Currency and Monetary Board.

:The circulation version has been available since 16 July 2007.

* $50 - yellow (polymer, 2017)
: In 2017, both Brunei and Singapore issued $50 polymer banknotes in commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of its Currency Interchangeability Agreement.

* $50 - yellow (polymer, 2017)
: In 2017, the Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam issued a $50 polymer banknote, alongside a 50 cent coin, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Sultan Hassan al-Bolkiah&#x27;s accession to the throne. On the front it depicts the monarch&#x27;s coronation alongside a portrait of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. One notable security feature of the note is the use of an optically variable ink called &quot;spark live&quot;.

<text>The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers and Greys) is a cavalry regiment of the British Army, and the senior Scottish regiment. The regiment, through the Royal Scots Greys, is the oldest surviving Cavalry Regiment of the Line in the British Army. The regiment is based at Waterloo Lines, Leuchars Station, as part of 51st Infantry Brigade and Headquarters Scotland, a light adaptable force brigade.

==History==
The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards were formed on 2 July 1971 at Holyrood, Edinburgh, by the amalgamation of the 3rd Carabiniers (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Dragoon Guards) (themselves the product of the amalgamation in 1922 of 3rd Dragoon Guards (Prince of Wales&#x27;s) and 6th Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers), and The Royal Scots Greys (2nd Dragoons).

Soon after, the regiment deployed on four tours of Northern Ireland in 1972, 1974, 1976 and 1980, suffering one fatality in 1972, when Trooper Ian Hunter Caie was killed by a bomb in a beer barrel that exploded in the path of his Ferret scout car in Moybane, near Crossmaglen County Armagh.
The regiment saw active service during the Gulf War in 1991 deploying 57 Challenger tanks and in Bosnia as part of SFOR in 1996–97. In 1998, it became the first regiment in the British Army to operate the Challenger 2 main battle tank. It deployed to Kosovo, as part of KFOR, in 2000.

The regiment deployed to Iraq for Operation Telic, the British element of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The bulk of the regiment deployed as part of the Scots Dragoon Guards Battle Group with a single squadron (A Squadron) detached to the First Battalion The Black Watch Battle Group. All deployed elements of the regiment took part in the advance on Iraq&#x27;s second largest city, Basra. Prior to reaching Basra, A Squadron fought in and around Az Zubayr and C Squadron was detached from the SCOTS DG BG to fight with 3 Commando Brigade in actions south of Basra that included Britain&#x27;s largest tank engagement since the Gulf War, when 14 Challenger 2 tanks engaged and destroyed 14 Iraqi tanks (the so-called &#x27;14–0&#x27; engagement).

The regiment saw more deployments to Iraq in 2006 and 2008, where it suffered two casualties, Lieutenant Richard Palmer and Corporal Gordon Pritchard. In 2008, 2011 and 2013/14 the regiment deployed to Afghanistan. The pipes and drums distinguished themselves, winning the award for &quot;Album of the Year&quot; at the 2009 Classical Brits for &quot;Spirit of the Glen: Journey,&quot; recorded on active service.

In November 2013, the unit was converted to a light cavalry unit, armed with Jackal vehicles. Under the Army 2020 plan, it was re-roled as a light cavalry unit, and moved to Leuchars Station in summer 2015. On 29 September 2015, Queen Elizabeth II visited Leuchars, where she named the north part of the camp &#x27;Waterloo Lines&#x27; in celebration of 200 years since the Battle of Waterloo.

The Regiment deployed to Cyprus with the United Nations on Operation TOSCA 27, where they conducted peace-keeping for six months from September 2017.

The Regiment deployed to Poland in 2019 and 2020 on Operation CABRIT as part of the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence Poland Battlegroup on two separate six month deployments with the A Squadron lead contingent named &quot;Dragoon Troop&quot; and the C Squadron lead Contingent named &quot;Balaklava Troop&quot;.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the unit deployed on Operation RESCRIPT where they assisted the NHS and local authorities across the UK.

In 2022, the unit resubordinated to 7th Brigade Combat Team as part of Future Soldier and deployed to Mali on Operation Newcombe.

==Organisation==
The regiment converted to the role of light cavalry as part of restructuring in the army under Army 2020. It is equipped with Jackal armoured fighting vehicles. The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards is paired with the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry, an Army Reserve light cavalry regiment.

The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards is broken into the following structure:

* Regimental Headquarters based at Edinburgh Castle
* Armoured Regiment Headquarters
** Headquarters Squadron - MAN Support vehicles, Land Rovers and Panther CLV equipped
*** Pipes and Drums of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards
** A Squadron - Jackal equipped
** B Squadron (Mutants) - Jackal equipped
** C Squadron - Jackal equipped
In common with other cavalry regiments of the British Army, all soldiers with the rank of OR-2 are called &#x27;Troopers&#x27;.

==Regimental museum==
The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Museum is situated at Edinburgh Castle. Opened in 2006, the exhibits include uniforms, medals, weapons, regalia, music and the French Imperial Eagle that was captured by Sergeant Charles Ewart of the Royal Scots Greys from the French &quot;45th Régiment d&#x27;Infanterie de Ligne&quot; at the Battle of Waterloo.

==Official abbreviation==
The regiment&#x27;s official abbreviation (as listed in Joint Service Publication 101 (Service Writing)) is SCOTS DG, the format of which follows the traditional Cavalry line.

==Accoutrements and uniform==

The cap badge features an eagle, which represents the French Imperial Eagle that was captured by Sergeant Charles Ewart of the Royal Scots Greys from the French 45th Regiment of Foot at the Battle of Waterloo. It is always worn with a black backing in mourning for Tsar Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia, who was their Colonel-in-Chief at the time of his execution. The cap badge also has the crossed carbines of the 3rd Carabiniers at the rear of the eagle.

The Plume of The Prince of Wales with its motto is worn by all members of the Regiment embroidered on the upper part of the left sleeve. The right to wear this badge was granted to the 3rd Dragoon Guards in 1765; it subsequently became the regiment&#x27;s cap badge and later, with the crossed carabines, formed the badge of the 3rd Carabiniers (Prince of Wales&#x27;s).

The distinctive yellow zigzag (or &quot;vandyke&quot;) cap band was inherited from the Royal Scots Greys, who had worn it since the mid-19th century.

As a royal regiment, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards is permitted to wear the Royal Stewart tartan, which was a privilege granted by King George VI, and is worn by the regiment&#x27;s pipers.

==Regimental mottos==
*The regimental motto is (No one provokes me with impunity), also the motto of the Order of the Thistle, to which it refers.
*The regiment also uses the motto &quot;Second to None&quot;.

==Traditions==
The Loyal Toast is drunk at formal dinners in the Mess and is always taken seated, except when Royalty is present. On evenings when a military band is present, besides playing God Save the King the band also plays &quot;God Bless the Prince of Wales&quot;, an old 3rd Dragoon Guards custom, and the &quot;Imperial Russian Anthem&quot; in memory of Tsar Nicholas II, the Colonel-in-Chief of the Scots Greys, murdered with his family during the Russian Civil War (1918).

==Pipes and drums==
The regiment has its own pipe band, who were first formed in 1946 and tour widely, performing in competitions, concerts and parades. It was the first official organized pipes and drums in the history of the regiment. Their most famous piece is &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, which reached number one in the charts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa in 1972. The track sold over seven million copies by mid 1977, and was awarded a gold disc. The track was also featured in the 1978 version of &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;. In Canada, the originating LP, &quot;Farewell To The Greys&quot;, was number nine for four weeks, beginning 24 June 1972.

The band released a new CD in late November 2007 through Universal Music, featuring a number of classic pipe tunes along with some modern arrangements, which was recorded while the regiment was based in Iraq. The album &quot;Spirit of the Glen&quot; was produced by Jon Cohen and released by Universal on 26 November 2007. It was a remake of their most popular song &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and featured the Czech Film Orchestra. &quot;Spirit of the Glen&quot; was officially launched at Edinburgh Castle and won &quot;Album of the Year&quot; at the 2009 Classical Brits. They have also made regular appearances at the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo over the years.

The bass drummer parades with a distinctive white bearskin cap with red plume. Adopted in 1887 for the jubilee of Queen Victoria, it was originally worn by the mounted kettle drummer of the band. At some point, the cap passed to the pipes and drums of the regiment. Folklore has it that the white bearskin was presented to the regiment by Tsar Nicholas II, the Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Scots Greys, however this is incorrect according to the regimental history. Additionally, pictures exist of this cap in use by the regimental kettle drummer prior to 1894 when Tsar Nicholas II was crowned.

== Band ==
Following the formation of the new regiment, the regimental bands of the 3rd Dragoon Guards and The Royal Scots Greys merged to form the Band of The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. The band deployed with the regiment on all operations, including during the Gulf War. Following significant reductions to the army in 1994, the band amalgamated with the Band of the Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards and Band of the Royal Dragoon Guards to form the new, smaller, Band of the Dragoon Guards. The percussion section of the new band, as an ode to The Royal Scots Greys, wore bearskins with a large crimson plume extending over the crest of the cap and black pants lined with yellow stripes. This was a direct copy of The Royal Scots Greys band&#x27;s old uniforms. In addition, the Drum Major&#x27;s uniform consisted of a black bearskin with large crimson plume over the crest of the cap and yellow pants, with the tunic of the Royal Dragoon Guards.

In 2006, this band amalgamated with the Cambrai Band of the Royal Tank Regiment to form the Heavy Cavalry and Cambrai Band, maintaining the percussion uniforms of the old band. Following the formation of the Band of the Royal Armoured Corps, the bearskin cap was lost, but the black and yellow pants were carried over.

<text>A regional park is an area of land preserved on account of its natural beauty, historic interest, recreational use or other reason, and under the administration of a form of local government.
==Definition==
A regional park can be a special park district covering a region crossing several jurisdiction boundaries, or a park system of a single jurisdiction, such as a province, county, or city.

==By country==

===Canada===

====Saskatchewan====
There are 101 regional parks in Saskatchewan. All parks are operated by volunteer boards.

===Italy===

Regional parks in Italy are administered by each region in Italy, a government unit like a U.S. state.

===Ireland===
Distinguished from National Parks in the Republic of Ireland, which are owned and run centrally by the state&#x27;s National Parks and Wildlife Service, Ireland&#x27;s regional parks are managed and operated by individual local authorities in Ireland. Examples include Ballincollig Regional Park (managed by Cork City Council), Millennium Regional Park (Fingal County Council), and Malahide Demesne Regional Park (also Fingal County Council).

===Lithuania===

A law to establish regional parks in Lithuania took effect in 1992. As of 2022, there were 30 such regional parks (&quot;regioniniai parkai&quot;). 

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, regional parks are administered by regional councils rather than the Department of Conservation or territorial authorities.

===United States===

====Definitions====
In the United States, a regional park is sometimes referred to as a &#x27;Metropolitan Park (Metropark)&#x27; or as an open space reserve. The terms &quot;region&quot; and &quot;metropolitan&quot; can have different meanings in U.S. local government agencies. Regional parks can be administered by a regional park board, a state, county or other units of local government. A special authority can be set up, under the joint jurisdiction of two or more government bodies or as an independent park district to administer parks. Individual parks may or may not cross governmental boundaries. The park district holds the authority, similar to fire protection districts, to manage and raise taxes to cover park acquisition and management costs.

====Midwest====
Examples of large regional park systems are the Cleveland Metroparks in Northeast Ohio, Huron-Clinton Metroparks in Southeast Michigan; and the Three Rivers Park District in Minnesota. In Ohio, under Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1545, metroparks such as the Cleveland Metroparks Park District, Columbus and Franklin County Metro Parks have their own Police Departments with sworn police officers. The Toledo Metroparks, and Dayton Five Rivers Metroparks are also in the state.

====California====

The East Bay Regional Park District and Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District have extensive parklands in the San Francisco Bay Area, protecting habitat and offering recreation.

===United Kingdom===
====Scotland====

In Scotland, regional parks are defined to co-ordinate the management of areas of attractive countryside that are of importance for recreation due to their proximity to population centres. The parks have been defined and are managed by local authorities. As of 2018, Scotland had three regional parks:
*Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park
*Lomond Hills Regional Park
*Pentland Hills Regional Park

====England====
*Lee Valley Regional Park

Northern Ireland 
Lagan Valley Regional Park
