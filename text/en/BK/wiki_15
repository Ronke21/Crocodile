<text>André Pierre Gabriel Amédée Tardieu (; 22 September 1876 – 15 September 1945) was three times Prime Minister of France (3 November 1929 – 17 February 1930; 2 March – 4 December 1930; 20 February – 10 May 1932) and a dominant figure of French political life in 1929–1932. He was a moderate conservative with a strong intellectual reputation, but became a weak prime minister at the start of the worldwide Great Depression.

==Biography==
Tardieu&#x27;s paternal grandmother was the composer and pianist Charlotte Tardieu. Andre Tardieu was a graduate of the elite &quot;Lycée Condorcet&quot;. He was accepted by the even more prestigious &quot;École Normale Supérieure&quot;, but instead entered the diplomatic service. Later, he left the service and became famous as foreign affairs editor of the newspaper &quot;Le Temps&quot;. He founded the conservative newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Echo National&quot; in association with Georges Mandel.

In 1914, Tardieu was elected to the Chamber of Deputies from the &quot;département&quot; of Seine-et-Oise, as a candidate of the center-right Democratic Republican Alliance (&quot;Alliance Démocratique&quot; – AD). He retained this seat till 1924. From 1926 to 1936, he represented the &quot;département&quot; of &quot;Territoire de Belfort&quot;.

When World War I broke out, Tardieu enlisted in the army and served before he was wounded and invalided home in 1916. He then returned to politics. He served as Georges Clemenceau&#x27;s lieutenant in 1919 during the Paris Peace Conference and as Commissioner for Franco-American War Cooperation. On 8 November 1919, he became Minister of Liberated Regions, administering Alsace and Lorraine, and served until Clemenceau&#x27;s defeat in 1920.

In 1926, Tardieu returned to government as Minister of Transportation under Raymond Poincaré. In 1928, he moved to Minister of the Interior, continuing under Poincaré&#x27;s successor Aristide Briand.

In November 1929, Tardieu himself succeeded Briand as &quot;Président du Conseil&quot; (Prime Minister) and remained Interior Minister. Though generally considered a conservative, he introduced a program of welfare measures, including public works, social insurance, and free secondary schooling, and he encouraged modern techniques in industry. On 11 March 1932, legislation was passed that established universal family allowances for all wage earners in business and industry with at least two children.

He hoped to replace the old ideological standoff between the right and left to a more relevant division based on the modern economy. He argued that &quot;a more dynamic capitalism would dry up the Marxism of the working classes.&quot; The goal of his leadership was prosperity. When the Great Depression began in 1929, his goal was to evade a depression in France, which worked for several years. According to Monique Clague, &quot;An obstinate deflationist throughout the thirties Tardieu would clearly not have given France a new deal.&quot; In the election of 1932 &quot;he acknowledged the responsibility of the modern state for curing unemployment, but, devoted to the Poincaré franc, he would have sacrificed employment to the maintenance of the gold standard.&quot;

Tardieu was displaced from both offices for ten days in February–March 1930 by Radical Camille Chautemps, but he returned until December. He was then Minister of Agriculture in 1931, Minister of War in 1932, and again Prime Minister (this time, also Minister of Foreign Affairs), from 20 February to 3 June 1932, until his coalition was defeated in the May elections.

As Prime Minister, Tardieu served for three (7–10 May 1932) days as the Acting President of the French Republic, between the assassination of Paul Doumer and the election of Albert Lebrun.

He was briefly a Minister of State without portfolio in 1934.

His later political activity was largely concerned with containing and responding to German expansion.

In his two-volume book &quot;La Révolution à refaire&quot;, Tardieu criticized the French parliamentary system.

<doc id="377014" wikidata="Q313763" url="?curid=377014" title="George Graham">
<text>George Graham (born 30 November 1944) is a Scottish former football player and manager.

Nicknamed &quot;Stroller&quot;, he made 455 appearances in England&#x27;s Football League as a midfielder or forward for Aston Villa, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United, Portsmouth and Crystal Palace. Approximately half of his appearances were for Arsenal, and he was part of the side that won the Football League Championship and FA Cup double in 1971. Graham also made 17 appearances for California Surf in the NASL in 1978.

He then moved to the coaching staff at Crystal Palace, before joining former Palace manager Terry Venables as a coach at Queens Park Rangers. As a manager, he won numerous honours with Arsenal between 1987 and 1995, including two league titles (in 1989 and 1991), the 1993 FA Cup, two Football League Cups (in 1987 and 1993), as well as the 1994 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. He also managed Millwall, Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur.

He was one of the most successful managers in Arsenal&#x27;s history, remaining in charge for almost a decade until he was sacked by the club&#x27;s board after being found guilty by the Football Association of taking money from transfers. Graham was banned despite paying back the money, which he always claimed was an &quot;unsolicited gift&quot;.

==Early life==
The youngest of seven children, Graham was born at Dykehead Road, Bargeddie, near Coatbridge on Thursday 30 November 1944. He grew up in poverty and was raised by his mother, Janet (26 April 1908 – 27 March 1977), after his father, Robert Young Graham (born 22 June 1900), died of tuberculosis and heart failure on Christmas Day 1944, when George was not yet a month old. His elder sister also died of tuberculosis on 22 February 1950.

While growing up, Graham showed considerable promise as a footballer, and Newcastle United, Chelsea and Aston Villa displayed an interest in signing him.

==Playing career==
===Aston Villa===
Graham received offers from Aston Villa, Chelsea and Newcastle United aged 15, in 1959, and visited all three clubs to see their facilities. He chose Aston Villa mainly as he and his family liked manager Joe Mercer, initially playing for their youth side, he signed professionally in 1961, on his 17th birthday. He spent five seasons at the Birmingham club, but only made ten appearances – though one of them was the club&#x27;s 1963 League Cup final loss to Birmingham City.

===Chelsea===
Chelsea signed Graham in July 1964 for £5,000. He scored 35 goals in 72 league games for the club and won a League Cup medal in 1965 but he, along with several other Chelsea players, increasingly clashed with their volatile manager Tommy Docherty. This culminated in Graham and seven others being sent home and disciplined by Docherty for breaking a pre-match curfew in 1965.

===Arsenal===
Bertie Mee&#x27;s Arsenal were looking for a replacement for Joe Baker, and paid £50,000 plus Tommy Baldwin in 1966 to bring Graham to Highbury. He made his debut on 1 October 1966 at home to Leicester City, and although the result was a 4–2 defeat he immediately became a regular in the Arsenal side. He was Arsenal&#x27;s top scorer in both 1966–67 and 1967–68, having started out as a centre forward for the club, but later moved back into midfield as an inside forward with John Radford moving from the wing to central striker.

With Arsenal, Graham was a runner-up in both the 1968 and 1969 League Cup finals, before finally winning a medal with the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. He followed it up with being an integral part of Arsenal&#x27;s Double-winning side of 1970–71, and even had a claim to scoring Arsenal&#x27;s equaliser in the FA Cup Final against Liverpool, although Eddie Kelly is officially credited with the goal.

Winning the Double brought the attention of Scotland and Graham was selected for the national side for the first time against Portugal on 13 October 1971. He would go on to win twelve caps over the next two years for Scotland, scoring three goals, his final one coming against Brazil on 30 June 1973. By then, however, Graham was no longer an Arsenal player. The arrival of Alan Ball midway through 1971–72 had made his place in the Arsenal side less assured. In total, he played 308 matches for Arsenal, scoring 77 goals. His final appearance was on 4 November 1972 when he came on as a substitute against Coventry City.

===Manchester United===
Graham moved for £120,000 to Manchester United in December 1972, where he was soon reunited with Docherty. He spent two years at United and was relegated to Division Two in 1974. He was sold to Portsmouth during the 1974–75 season.

===Portsmouth, Crystal Palace and California Surf===
Graham saw out his career in England at Portsmouth and Crystal Palace. He played the summer of 1978 in America for the California Surf.

==Managerial career==

===Millwall===
After retiring from playing in 1978, Graham became the youth team coach at Crystal Palace and then from October 1980 Queens Park Rangers. On 6 December 1982, he was appointed manager of Millwall, who were then bottom of the old Third Division. Graham turned the side around in a short period of time—they avoided relegation that season on the final match of the season with a 1–0 win at Chesterfield. The following season they finished 9th and in 1984–85 they were promoted to the old Second Division. After Graham left the club in 1986 when Millwall finished mid table, they went on to win the Second Division and win promotion to the First in 1987–88.

===Arsenal===
Graham&#x27;s achievements at Millwall attracted attention from First Division clubs, and with the resignation of Don Howe as Arsenal manager in March 1986, their directors first offered the job to FC Barcelona coach Terry Venables, but he rejected their offer and Arsenal switched their attention to Alex Ferguson, the Aberdeen manager, as their new manager with Graham as his assistant. However, Ferguson (then in temporary charge of the Scotland national football team following the death of Jock Stein the previous September, and still in charge of Aberdeen) had decided to wait until after the World Cup that summer before deciding on his future. Graham himself had never even applied for the Arsenal position but on 12 May 1986 his chairman at Millwall, Alan Thorne, told him that Arsenal wanted to speak to him about the manager&#x27;s job. After an interview with Peter Hill-Wood, David Dein and Ken Friar at Hill-Wood&#x27;s home, the Arsenal directors appointed Graham as their new manager on 14 May 1986. A month after arriving at Highbury, Graham was himself linked with the Scotland national team, possibly combining it with the Arsenal manager&#x27;s job, but that role went to Andy Roxburgh instead.

Arsenal had not won a trophy since the FA Cup in 1978–79, and were drifting away from the top teams in the League, having not finished in the top five during any of the previous four seasons, during which the major honours were picked up by an all-conquering Liverpool as well as the likes of Manchester United and Everton.

Graham quickly discarded the likes of Paul Mariner, who already had been released on a free transfer, Tony Woodcock, Stewart Robson and Tommy Caton, and replaced them with new signings and youth team products. He also imposed much stricter discipline than his predecessors, both in the dressing room and on the pitch and told the team he expected them to be dressed in club blazers on match day. Arsenal&#x27;s form immediately improved, so much so that the club were top of the League at Christmas 1986, the club&#x27;s centenary, for the first time in a decade. However, Graham said he knew the team weren&#x27;t ready to mount a sustained title challenge. This was proven to be correct as Arsenal finished fourth in Graham&#x27;s first season in charge, but they went on to win the 1987 League Cup, beating Liverpool 2–1 at Wembley on 5 April. The key players in the upturn were young defender Tony Adams and high-scoring winger Martin Hayes.

While Arsenal lost the League Cup final the following year (a shock 3–2 defeat to Luton Town), they remained consistent in the league. Graham&#x27;s side featured tight defensive discipline, embodied by his young captain Tony Adams, who along with Lee Dixon, Steve Bould and Nigel Winterburn, would form the basis of the club&#x27;s defence for over a decade. However, contrary to popular belief, during this time Arsenal were not a purely defensive side; Graham also built up an impressive midfield containing David Rocastle, Paul Davis, Michael Thomas and Paul Merson, and striker Alan Smith, whose prolific goal-scoring regularly brought him more than 20 goals per season.

At the end of Graham&#x27;s third season (1988–89), the club won their first League title since 1971 (when Graham had been an Arsenal player), in highly dramatic fashion, in the final game of the season against holders and league leaders Liverpool at Anfield. Arsenal needed to win by two goals to take the title; Alan Smith scored early in the second half to make it 1–0, but as time ticked by Arsenal struggled to get a second, and with the 90 minutes elapsed on the clock, they still needed another goal. With only seconds to go, a Smith flick-on found Michael Thomas surging through the Liverpool defence; the young midfielder calmly lifted the ball over Bruce Grobbelaar and into the net, and Arsenal were League Champions. However, there was no chance to enter the European Cup just yet for Graham&#x27;s team, as the ban on English clubs in European competitions (which was imposed by UEFA in 1985 following the Heysel disaster) continued for another season.

After finishing fourth in 1989–90, Graham signed goalkeeper David Seaman and Swedish winger Anders Limpar in the close season; both players proved vital as Arsenal won a second title in 1990–91 and reached the FA Cup semi-finals, losing to arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur. They lost just one league game all season - their 24th match of the league campaign against Chelsea on 2 February.

Arsenal finished ahead of runners-up Liverpool in the race for the league title that season; in February 1991 the Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish had suddenly announced his resignation as manager, and Graham&#x27;s name was among those mentioned by the media as a possible successor to Dalglish. However, Graham was quick to rule himself out of the running, and the job instead went to another Scot, Graeme Souness.

In the autumn of 1991, Graham went on to sign a striker who would break the club&#x27;s all-time top scoring records, Ian Wright from Crystal Palace, and led the club into their first entry in the European Cup for twenty years. However, the continental adventure was short-lived: Arsenal were knocked out by S.L. Benfica in the second round and failed to make the lucrative final stages. 1991–92 brought more disappointment when the &quot;Gunners&quot; were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by lowly Wrexham, though Arsenal did reasonably well in the league, finishing fourth.

After this season, Graham changed his tactics; he became more defensive and turned out far less attack-minded sides, which depended mainly on goals from Wright rather than the whole team. Between 1986–87 and 1991–92, Arsenal averaged 66 League goals a season (scoring 81 in 1991–92), but between 1992–93 and 1994–95 only averaged 48; this included just 40 in 1992–93, when the club finished 10th in the inaugural season of the FA Premier League, scoring fewer than any other team in the division.

Graham&#x27;s Arsenal became cup specialists, and in 1992–93 they became the first side to win the FA Cup and League Cup double, both times beating Sheffield Wednesday, 2–1 in the League Cup Final and 2–1 in the FA Cup Final replay. The next season they continued in the same vein, winning the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, their second European trophy; in the final Arsenal beat favourites and holders Parma 1–0 with a tight defensive performance and Alan Smith&#x27;s 21st-minute goal from a left foot volley.

The 1994 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup proved to be Graham&#x27;s last trophy at the club. It was on 21 February 1995 that Graham, who had led Arsenal to six trophies in eight seasons, lost his job after a Premier League inquiry found he had accepted an illegal £425,000 payment from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge following Arsenal&#x27;s 1992 acquisition of John Jensen and Pål Lydersen, two of Hauge&#x27;s clients. Graham was eventually banned for a year by the Football Association for his involvement in the scandal, after he admitted he had received an &quot;unsolicited gift&quot; from Hauge. At the time, Arsenal were struggling a little in the league, had lost a League Cup quarter final to Liverpool, been dumped out of the FA Cup after a third round replay by Millwall, and (as Cup Winners&#x27; Cup holders) had also lost the Super Cup to AC Milan. Regardless, Graham&#x27;s sacking was more down to the illegal &#x27;brown envelopes&#x27; of money, as the word &quot;bung&quot; embedded itself in the football lexicon.

===Leeds United===
After serving his ban, Graham&#x27;s return to football management came with Leeds United in September 1996. After the fifth game of the season he replaced the long serving Howard Wilkinson. Graham was swiftly appointed but found himself unable to make an immediate impact, leading Leeds to five losses from his first six in the league and another defeat to Aston Villa in the League Cup.

Going into November, Leeds hovered just above the relegation zone and no side in the division had conceded more goals. Graham&#x27;s miserable start to the job was compounded with a 3–0 defeat away to Arsenal, one of Arsène Wenger&#x27;s first games in charge. But soon enough, the Scottish coach&#x27;s methods started to bear fruit in a brutally efficient fashion.

By the turn of the year, Leeds were unmistakably a George Graham team – risk-averse to the point of parody, yet unarguably solid as a rock. Before Christmas, they went a club-record five games without conceding, with goalless draws in successive outings against Middlesbrough, Tottenham and Everton. Packing the defence with as many bodies as possible, with Lucas Radebe becoming a top-class operator and Nigel Martyn offering a strong argument to be England&#x27;s No. 1. Leeds had become a defensive powerhouse. It was The Graham Way: at least eight of Leeds&#x27; 11 men were focused first and foremost on nullifying the opposition. It invariably worked. They ended the season with 20 clean sheets – a club record for a 38-game season that&#x27;s unlikely to be broken. In the end, Leeds scored just 28 goals. Not only did they stay up, but they somehow finished 11th.

Where Leeds scored 28 goals in the 1996–97 season, they notched 57 in the 1997–98 season. That one season would prove useful in laying solid organisational foundations for the years to come. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was signed in the summer of 1997, scoring 16 Premier League goals, and 22 in all competitions, as Leeds finished 5th during Graham&#x27;s one full season in charge, while the club continued their ascent under his former assistant and successor David O&#x27;Leary. Graham left Leeds in acrimonious circumstances, returning to London to take over at Tottenham on 1 October 1998.

The move came at Leeds&#x27; hotel on the island of Madeira following Leeds UEFA Cup first round penalty shootout victory over Portuguese League side Maritimo 29 September 1998. Spurs&#x27; Alan Sugar telephoned Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale, who admitted that after a brief telephone conversation a deal was done, with compensation agreed which would allow Graham to fulfil his wish of returning to London. Graham made no secret of his desire to head back to the capital following Leeds&#x27; 3–3 draw with Tottenham in North London on 26 September 1998. He cited family and personal reasons.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Five months after taking charge of Tottenham Hotspur, he guided the club to victory over Leicester City in the 1999 League Cup Final, and with it a place in the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup. Despite guiding the club to its first trophy in eight seasons, Graham could not achieve a finish higher than tenth in the Premier League.

Tottenham reached the last four of the 2000–01 FA Cup with a 3–2 victory over West Ham United on 11 March 2001 and Graham was looking forward to pitting his wits against his former club Arsenal in the semi-finals. He was sacked five days later, on 16 March 2001, soon after the club had been purchased by ENIC, for alleged breach of contract. The club stated that Graham had been issued &quot;several written warnings prior to his sacking for giving out what was deemed by the club as being private information&quot; before, earlier that week, apparently informing the media he had &quot;a limited budget&quot; for new players and expressing his disappointment with it. This led to his being summoned to a meeting with Spurs executive vice-chairman David Buchler, after which he was dismissed. Buchler subsequently questioned whether Graham had the interests of the club at heart and described his conduct in the meeting as &quot;aggressive and defiant&quot;. Graham&#x27;s legal representatives issued a statement expressing he was &quot;shocked and upset to have been sacked and could not believe such a flimsy excuse was given&quot;. It went on to say that Graham &quot;believes ENIC always intended to sack him.&quot;

===Since 2001===
After Spurs, Graham never returned to management. He was a pundit on Sky TV for several years, in particular their PremPlus channel. He also commentated on the 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2005 FA Cup Finals featuring Arsenal.

However, he was linked with several managerial vacancies after leaving Tottenham. In October 2001, following the dismissal of Peter Taylor at Leicester City, he was linked with that vacancy, but it was filled by Dave Bassett instead.

The following season, with Glenn Roeder under fire at the helm of a West Ham United side heading for Premier League relegation, Graham&#x27;s name was mentioned as a possible replacement, but Roeder actually lasted until the opening weeks of the 2003–04 season and this time there was little mention of Graham&#x27;s name in the hunt for a successor, which ended with the appointment of Alan Pardew. In the 2003 close season, the resignation of Graham Taylor at Aston Villa saw Graham&#x27;s name mentioned by the media as a possible successor, but again nothing came of it, with this vacancy being filled by David O&#x27;Leary, who had played under Graham at Arsenal and worked as his assistant at Leeds. He and O&#x27;Leary had both been mentioned as candidates for the job at Sunderland twice during the 2002–03 season following the departure of Peter Reid in October and Howard Wilkinson in March.

==Personal life==
On 16 September 1967, Graham married model Marie Zia at Marylebone Register Office; his close friend Terry Venables acted as his best man and the two players took to the field the same afternoon for opposing teams in a North London derby; the groom&#x27;s team won 4–0. The couple had two children. The marriage ended in 1988.

Graham married Susan Schmidt on 13 December 1998 in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and live in Hampstead, London.

Graham revealed in 2009 that he suffers from arthritis. &quot;I love my golf but because of my arthritis, I&#x27;ve not played much in the last two years, if any. When I was a player, when I had a lot of time on my hands, I got down to an eight handicap. But when I was manager, I went back to 12. I&#x27;ve just taken up tennis and have to say I&#x27;m not very good.&quot;

<text>A combination lock is a type of locking device in which a sequence of symbols, usually numbers, is used to open the lock. The sequence may be entered using a single rotating dial which interacts with several discs or &quot;cams&quot;, by using a set of several rotating discs with inscribed symbols which directly interact with the locking mechanism, or through an electronic or mechanical keypad. Types range from inexpensive three-digit luggage locks to high-security safes. Unlike ordinary padlocks, combination locks do not use keys.


==History==
The earliest known combination lock was excavated in a Roman period tomb on the Kerameikos, Athens. Attached to a small box, it featured several dials instead of keyholes. In 1206, the Muslim engineer Ismail al-Jazari documented a combination lock in his book &quot;al-Ilm Wal-Amal al-Nafi Fi Sina&#x27;at al-Hiyal&quot; (&quot;The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices&quot;). Muhammad al-Asturlabi (ca. 1200) also made combination locks.

Gerolamo Cardano later described a combination lock in the 16th century.

U.S. Patents regarding combination padlocks by J.B. Gray in 1841 and by J.E. Treat in 1869 describe themselves as improvements, suggesting that such mechanisms were already in use.

Joseph Loch was said to have invented the modern combination lock for Tiffany&#x27;s Jewelers in New York City, and from the 1870s to the early 1900s, made many more improvements in the designs and functions of such locks. However, his patent claim states: &quot;I do not claim as my invention a tumbler composed of two disks, one working within the other, such not being my invention.&quot;, but there is no reference to prior art of this type of lock.

The first commercially viable single-dial combination lock was patented on 1 February 1910 by John Junkunc, owner of American Lock Company.

== Types ==

===Multiple-dial locks===
One of the simplest types of combination lock, often seen in low-security bicycle locks, briefcases, and suitcases, uses several rotating discs with notches cut into them. The lock is secured by a pin with several teeth on it which hook into the rotating discs. When the notches in the discs align with the teeth on the pin, the lock can be opened.

===Single-dial locks===
The rotary combination locks found on padlocks, lockers, or safes may use a single dial which interacts with several parallel discs or &quot;cams&quot;. Customarily, a lock of this type is opened by rotating the dial clockwise to the first numeral, counterclockwise to the second, and so on in an alternating fashion until the last numeral is reached. The cams typically have an indentation or notch, and when the correct permutation is entered, the notches align, allowing the latch to fit into them and open the lock.

The C. L. Gougler Keyless Locks Company manufactured locks for which the combination was a set number of audible clicks to the left and right, allowing them to be unlocked in darkness or by the vision-impaired.

In 1978 a combination lock which could be set by the user to a sequence of his own choosing was invented by Andrew Elliot Rae. At this time the electronic keypad was invented and he was unable to get any manufacturers to back his mechanical lock for lockers, luggage, or brief-cases. The silicon chip locks never became popular due to the need for battery power to maintain their integrity. The patent expired and the original mechanical invention was instantly manufactured and sold worldwide mainly for luggage, lockers, and hotel safes. It is now a standard part of the luggage used by travellers.

===Other designs===
Many doors use combination locks which require the user to enter a numeric sequence on a keypad to gain entry. These special locks usually require the additional use of electronic circuitry, although purely mechanical keypad locks have been available since 1936. The chief advantage of this system is that multiple persons can be granted access without having to supply an expensive physical key to each person. Also, in case the key is compromised, &quot;changing&quot; the lock requires only configuring a new key code and informing the users, which will generally be cheaper and quicker than the same process for traditional key locks.

Electronic combination locks, while generally safe from the attacks on their mechanical counterparts, suffer from their own set of flaws. If the arrangement of numbers is fixed, it is easy to determine the lock sequence by viewing several successful accesses. Similarly, the numbers in the combination (but not the actual sequence) may be determined by which keys show signs of recent use. More advanced electronic locks may scramble the numbers&#x27; locations randomly to prevent these attacks.

There is a variation of the traditional dial based combination lock wherein the &quot;secret&quot; is encoded in an electronic microcontroller. These are popular for safe and bank vault doors where tradition tends towards dial locks rather than keys. They allow many valid combinations, one per authorized user, so changing one person&#x27;s access has no effect on other users. These locks often have auditing features, recording which combination is used at what time for every opening. Power for the lock may be provided by a battery or by a tiny generator set in operation by spinning the dial.

==Internal mechanisms ==
* A relock trigger, or internal relocker, is an integral part of the combination lock itself. It is usually designed to activate when the dial spindle is punched through. The trigger may consist of a spring-loaded lever or plunger that engages the bolt when the back cover is dislodged from the lock case. Some combination locks also are equipped with a thermal relock trigger that activates in the event of a torch attack. Nearly all safes made after World War II have relock triggers in their combination locks.

<text>James Butler Hickok (May 27, 1837August 2, 1876), better known as &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok, was a folk hero of the American Old West known for his life on the frontier as a soldier, scout, lawman, cattle rustler, gunslinger, gambler, showman, and actor, and for his involvement in many famous gunfights. He earned a great deal of notoriety in his own time, much of it bolstered by the many outlandish and often fabricated tales he told about himself. Some contemporaneous reports of his exploits are known to be fictitious, but they remain the basis of much of his fame and reputation.

Hickok was born and raised on a farm in northern Illinois at a time when lawlessness and vigilante activity were rampant because of the influence of the &quot;Banditti of the Prairie&quot;. Drawn to this criminal lifestyle, he headed west at age 18 as a fugitive from justice, working as a stagecoach driver and later as a lawman in the frontier territories of Kansas and Nebraska. He fought and spied for the Union Army during the American Civil War and gained publicity after the war as a scout, marksman, actor, and professional gambler. He was involved in several notable shootouts during the course of his life.

In 1876, Hickok was shot and killed while playing poker in a saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory (present-day South Dakota) by Jack McCall, an unsuccessful gambler. The hand of cards that he supposedly held at the time of his death has become known as the dead man&#x27;s hand: two pairs; black aces and eights.

Hickok remains a popular figure of frontier history. Many historic sites and monuments commemorate his life, and he has been depicted numerous times in literature, film, and television. He is chiefly portrayed as a protagonist, although historical accounts of his actions are often controversial, and much of his career is known to have been exaggerated both by himself and by contemporary mythmakers. While Hickok claimed to have shot numerous gunmen in his lifetime, he killed only six or seven, all between 1861 and 1871 according to Joseph G. Rosa, Hickok&#x27;s biographer and the foremost authority on him.

==Early life==
James Butler Hickok was born May 27, 1837, in Homer, Illinois, (present-day Troy Grove, Illinois) to William Alonzo Hickok (1801–1852), a farmer and abolitionist, and his wife, Pamelia Hickok (née Butler, 1804–1878). Hickok was of English ancestry. James was the fourth of six children. His father was said to have used the family house, now demolished, as a station on the Underground Railroad. William Hickok died in 1852, when James was 15.

Hickok was a good shot from a young age, and was recognized locally as an outstanding marksman with a pistol. Photographs of Hickok appear to depict dark hair, but all contemporaneous descriptions affirm that he had red hair.

In 1855, at age 18, James Hickok fled Illinois following a fight with Charles Hudson, during which both fell into a canal; each thought, mistakenly, that he had killed the other. Hickok moved to Leavenworth in the Kansas Territory, where he joined Jim Lane&#x27;s Free State Army (also known as the Jayhawkers), an antislavery vigilante group active in the new territory during the Bleeding Kansas era. While there he met 12-year-old William Cody (later known as &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;), who, despite his youth, served as a scout just two years later for the U.S. Army during the Utah War.

===Nicknames===

Hickok used his late father&#x27;s name, William Hickok, from 1858, and the name William Haycock during the American Civil War. Most newspapers referred to him as William Haycock until 1869. He was arrested while using the name Haycock in 1865. He afterward resumed using his given name, James Hickok. Military records after 1865 list him as Hickok, but he was also known as Haycock. In an 1867 article about his shootout with Davis Tutt, his surname was misspelled as Hitchcock.

While in Nebraska, Hickok was derisively referred to by one man as &quot;Duck Bill&quot; for his long nose and protruding lips. He was also known before 1861 among Jayhawkers as &quot;Shanghai Bill&quot; because of his height and slim build. He grew a moustache following the McCanles incident, and in 1861 began calling himself &quot;Wild Bill&quot;.

==Early career==
In 1857, Hickok claimed a tract in Johnson County, Kansas, near present-day Lenexa. On March 22, 1858, he was elected one of the first four constables of Monticello Township. In 1859, he joined the Russell, Majors and Waddell freight company, the parent company of the Pony Express.

In 1860, Hickok was badly injured by a bear, while driving a freight team from Independence, Missouri, to Santa Fe, New Mexico. According to Hickok&#x27;s account, he found the road blocked by a cinnamon bear and its two cubs. Dismounting, he approached the bear and fired a shot into its head, but the bullet ricocheted off its skull, infuriating it. The bear attacked, crushing Hickok with its body. Hickok managed to fire another shot, wounding the bear&#x27;s paw. The bear then grabbed his arm in its mouth, but Hickok was able to grab his knife and slash its throat, killing it.

Hickok was severely injured, with a crushed chest, shoulder, and arm. He was bedridden for four months before being sent to Rock Creek Station in the Nebraska Territory to work as a stable hand while he recovered. There, the freight company had built a stagecoach stop along the Oregon Trail near Fairbury, Nebraska, on land purchased from David McCanles.

===McCanles shooting===
On July 12, 1861, David McCanles went to the Rock Creek Station office to demand an overdue property payment from Horace Wellman, the station manager. McCanles reportedly threatened Wellman, and either Wellman or Hickok, who was hiding behind a curtain, killed McCanles. Two men with McCanles (James Wood and James Gordon) were also killed. Hickok, Wellman, and another employee, J.W. Brink, were tried for killing McCanles, but were found to have acted in self-defense. McCanles may have been the first man Hickok killed. Hickok subsequently visited McCanles&#x27; widow, apologized for the killing, and offered her $35 [$ in dollars] in restitution, all the money he had with him at the time.

===Civil War service===
After the Civil War broke out in April 1861, Hickok became a teamster for the Union Army in Sedalia, Missouri. By the end of 1861, he was a wagon master, but in September 1862, he was discharged for unknown reasons. He then joined General James Henry Lane&#x27;s Kansas Brigade, and while serving with the brigade, met his friend Buffalo Bill Cody, who was serving as a scout.

In late 1863, Hickok worked for the provost marshal of southwest Missouri as a member of the Springfield detective police. His work included identifying and counting the number of troops in uniform who were drinking while on duty, verifying hotel liquor licenses, and tracking down individuals who owed money to the cash-strapped Union Army.

Buffalo Bill claimed that he encountered Hickok disguised as a Confederate officer in Missouri in 1864. Hickok had not been paid for some time, and was hired as a scout by General John B. Sanborn by early 1865. In June, Hickok mustered out and went to Springfield, where he gambled. The 1883 &quot;History of Greene County, Missouri&quot; described him as &quot;by nature a ruffian ... a drunken, swaggering fellow, who delighted when &#x27;on a spree&#x27; to frighten nervous men and timid women.&quot;

==Lawman and scout==
===Duel with Davis Tutt===
While in Springfield, Hickok and a local gambler named Davis Tutt had several disagreements over unpaid gambling debts and their common affection for the same women. Hickok lost a gold watch to Tutt in a poker game. The watch had great sentimental value to Hickok, so he asked Tutt not to wear it in public. They initially agreed not to fight over the watch, but when Hickok saw Tutt wearing it, he warned him to stay away. On July 21, 1865, the two men faced off in Springfield&#x27;s town square, standing sideways before drawing and firing their weapons. Their quick-draw duel was recorded as the first of its kind. Tutt&#x27;s shot missed, but Hickok&#x27;s struck Tutt through the heart from about away. Tutt called out, &quot;Boys, I&#x27;m killed&quot;, before he collapsed and died.

Two days later, Hickok was arrested for murder. The charge was later reduced to manslaughter. He was released on $2,000 bail and stood trial on August 3, 1865. At the end of the trial, Judge Sempronius H. Boyd told the jury they could not find that Hickok acted in self-defense if he could have reasonably avoided the fight. However, if they felt the threat of danger was real and imminent, he instructed that they could apply the unwritten law of the &quot;fair fight&quot; and acquit. The jury voted to clear Hickok, resulting in public backlash and criticism of the verdict.

Several weeks later, an interview Hickok gave to Colonel George Ward Nichols, a journalist who subsequently became known as the creator of the Hickok legend, was published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot;. Under the name &quot;Wild Bill Hitchcock&quot;, the article recounted the &quot;hundreds&quot; of men whom Hickok had personally killed and other exaggerated exploits. The article was controversial wherever Hickok was known, and several frontier newspapers wrote rebuttals.

===Deputy U.S. marshal in Kansas===
In September 1865, Hickok came in second in the election for city marshal of Springfield. Leaving Springfield, he was recommended for the position of deputy federal marshal at Fort Riley, Kansas. This was during the Indian Wars, in which Hickok sometimes served as a scout for General George A. Custer&#x27;s 7th Cavalry.

Henry M. Stanley, of the &quot;Weekly Missouri Democrat&quot;, reported Hickok to be &quot;an inveterate hater of Indian People&quot;, perhaps to enhance his reputation as a scout and American fighter. But separating fact from fiction is difficult considering his recruitment of Indians to cross the nation to appear in his own Wild West show. Witnesses confirm that while working as a scout at Fort Harker, Kansas, on May 11, 1867, Hickok was attacked by a large group of Indians, who fled after he shot and killed two. In July, Hickok told a newspaper reporter that he had led several soldiers in pursuit of Indians who had killed four men near the fort on July 2. He reported returning with five prisoners after killing 10. Witnesses confirm that the story was true to the extent the party had set out to find whoever had killed the four men, but the group returned to the fort &quot;without nary a dead Indian, [never] even seeing a live one&quot;.

In December 1867, newspapers reported that Hickok had come to stay in Hays City, Kansas. He became a deputy U.S. marshal, and on March 28, 1868, he picked up 11 Union Army deserters who had been charged with stealing government property. Hickok was assigned to bring the men to Topeka for trial, and he requested a military escort from Fort Hays. He was assigned Buffalo Bill Cody, a sergeant, and five privates. They arrived in Topeka on April 2. Hickok remained in Hays through August 1868, when he brought 200 Cheyenne Indians to Hays to be viewed by &quot;excursionists&quot;.

On September 1, 1868, Hickok was in Lincoln County, Kansas, where he was hired as a scout by the 10th Cavalry Regiment, a segregated African-American unit. On September 4, Hickok was wounded in the foot while rescuing several cattlemen in the Bijou Creek basin who had been surrounded by Indians. The 10th Regiment arrived at Fort Lyon in Colorado in October and remained there for the rest of 1868.

===Marshal of Hays, Kansas===

In July 1869, Hickok returned to Hays and was elected city marshal of Hays and sheriff of Ellis County, Kansas, in a special election held on August 23, 1869. Three sheriffs had quit during the previous 18 months. Hickok may have been acting sheriff before he was elected; a newspaper reported that he arrested offenders on August 18, and the commander of Fort Hays wrote a letter to the assistant adjutant general on August 21 in which he praised Hickok for his work in apprehending deserters.

The regular county election was held on November 2, 1869. Hickok ran as an Independent; but lost to his deputy, Peter Lanihan, who ran as a Democrat. Hickok and Lanihan, however, remained sheriff and deputy, respectively. Hickok accused a J.V. Macintosh of irregularities and misconduct during the election. On December 9, Hickok and Lanihan both served legal papers on Macintosh, and local newspapers acknowledged that Hickok had guardianship of Hays City.

===Killings as sheriff===
In September 1869, his first month as sheriff, Hickok killed two men. The first was Bill Mulvey, who was galloping through town on a rampage, drunk, shooting out mirrors and whisky bottles behind bars. Citizens warned Mulvey to behave, because Hickok was sheriff. Mulvey angrily declared that he had come to town to kill Hickok. When he saw Hickok, he leveled his cocked rifle at him. Hickok waved his hand past Mulvey at some supposed onlookers and yelled, &quot;Don&#x27;t shoot him in the back; he is drunk.&quot; Mulvey wheeled his horse around to face those who might shoot him from behind, and before he realized he had been fooled, Hickok shot him through the temple.

The second man killed by Hickok was Samuel Strawhun, a cowboy, who was causing a disturbance in a saloon at 1:00 am on September 27, when Hickok and Lanihan went to the scene. Strawhun &quot;made remarks against Hickok&quot;, and Hickok killed him with a shot through the head. Hickok said he had &quot;tried to restore order&quot;. At the coroner&#x27;s inquest into Strawhun&#x27;s death, despite &quot;very contradictory&quot; evidence from witnesses, the jury found the shooting justifiable.

On July 17, 1870, Hickok was attacked by two troopers from the 7th U.S. Cavalry, Jeremiah Lonergan and John Kyle (sometimes spelled Kile), in a saloon. Lonergan pinned Hickok to the ground, and Kyle put his gun to Hickok&#x27;s ear. When Kyle&#x27;s weapon misfired, Hickok shot Lonergan, wounding him in the knee, and shot Kyle twice, killing him. Hickok again lost his re-election bid to his deputy.

===Marshal of Abilene, Kansas===
On April 15, 1871, Hickok became marshal of Abilene, Kansas. He replaced Tom &quot;Bear River&quot; Smith, who had been killed while serving an arrest warrant on November 2, 1870.
Outlaw John Wesley Hardin arrived in Abilene at the end of a cattle drive in early 1871. Hardin was a well-known gunfighter, and is known to have killed more than 27 men. In his 1895 autobiography, published after his death, Hardin claimed to have been befriended by Hickok, the newly elected town marshal, after he had disarmed the marshal using the road agent&#x27;s spin, but Hardin was known to exaggerate. In any case, Hardin appeared to have thought highly of Hickok.

Hickok later said he did not know that &quot;Wesley Clemmons&quot; was Hardin&#x27;s alias, nor that he was a wanted outlaw. He told Clemmons (Hardin) to stay out of trouble in Abilene and asked him to hand over his guns, and Hardin complied. Hardin alleged that when his cousin, Mannen Clements, was jailed for the killing of two cowhands (Joe and Dolph Shadden) in July 1871, Hickok—at Hardin&#x27;s request—arranged for his escape.

In August 1871, Hickok sought to arrest Hardin for killing Charles Couger in an Abilene hotel &quot;for snoring too loud&quot;. Hardin left Kansas before Hickok could arrest him. A newspaper reported, &quot;A man was killed in his bed at a hotel in Abilene, Monday night, by a desperado called ″Arkansas″. The murderer escaped. This was his sixth murder.&quot;

===Shootout with Phil Coe===
Hickok and Phil Coe, a saloon owner and acquaintance of Hardin&#x27;s, had a dispute that resulted in a shootout. The Bull&#x27;s Head Saloon in Abilene had been established by gambler Ben Thompson and Coe, his partner, businessman, and fellow gambler. The two entrepreneurs had painted a picture of a bull with a large erect penis on the side of their establishment as an advertisement. Citizens of the town complained to Hickok, who requested that Thompson and Coe remove the image. They refused, so Hickok altered it himself. Infuriated, Thompson tried to incite John Wesley Hardin to kill Hickok by exclaiming to Hardin that &quot;He&#x27;s a damn Yankee. Picks on rebels, especially Texans, to kill.&quot; Hardin was in town under his assumed name Wesley Clemmons, but was better known to the townspeople by the alias &quot;Little Arkansas&quot;. He seemed to have respect for Hickok&#x27;s abilities and replied, &quot;If Bill needs killing, why don&#x27;t you kill him yourself?&quot; Hoping to intimidate Hickok, Coe allegedly stated that he could &quot;kill a crow on the wing&quot;. Hickok&#x27;s retort is one of the West&#x27;s most famous sayings (though possibly apocryphal): &quot;Did the crow have a pistol? Was he shooting back? I will be.&quot;

On October 5, 1871, Hickok was standing off a crowd during a street brawl when Coe fired two shots. Hickok ordered him to be arrested for firing a pistol within the city limits. Coe claimed that he was shooting at a stray dog, and then suddenly turned his gun on Hickok, who fired first and killed Coe. In another account of the Coe shootout: Theophilus Little, the mayor of Abilene and owner of the town&#x27;s lumber yard, recorded his time in Abilene by writing in a notebook, which was ultimately given to the Abilene Historical Society. Writing in 1911, he detailed his admiration for Hickok and included a paragraph on the shooting that differs considerably from the reported account:

After shooting Coe, Hickok caught a glimpse of someone running toward him and quickly fired two more shots in reaction, accidentally shooting and killing Abilene Special Deputy Marshal Mike Williams, who was coming to his aid. This was the last time Hickok was ever involved in a gunfight; the accidental death of Deputy Williams was an event that haunted Hickok for the remainder of his life.

Hickok was relieved of his duties as marshal less than two months after the accidental shooting, this incident being only one of a series of questionable shootings and claims of misconduct during his career.

==Later life==

In 1872, Hickok recruited six Native Americans and three cowboys to accompany him to Niagara Falls, where he put on an outdoor demonstration called &quot;The Daring Buffalo Chase of the Plains&quot;. Since the event was outdoors, he could not compel people to pay, and the venture was a financial failure. The show featured six buffalo, a bear, and a monkey, and one show ended in disaster when a buffalo refused to act, prompting Hickok to fire a bullet into the sky. This angered the buffalo and panicked audience members, causing the animals to break free of their wire fencing and chase audience members, some of whom were trampled. The incident helped contribute to the overall failure of the show.

In 1873, Buffalo Bill Cody and Texas Jack Omohundro invited Hickok to join their troupe after their earlier success. Hickok did not enjoy acting, and often hid behind scenery. In one show, he shot the spotlight when it focused on him. He was released from the group after a few months.

===Eye trouble===
From 1871 until his death in 1876, Hickok had vision problems. A former cavalryman, J.W. &quot;Doc&quot; Howard, who had known Hickok, stated that Hickok had left Buffalo Bill&#x27;s &quot;Scouts of the Plains&quot; exhibition &quot;because the lights affected his eyes, so he had to give it up&quot;.

Charles Snyder, the Lucien Howe Librarian of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, said &quot;Granular conjunctivitis, ophthalmia, trachoma—call it what you will—was common on the Western Frontier. Jesse James suffered from it.&quot;

In 1876, Hickok sought treatment from an eye specialist in Kansas City, Missouri. No definitive diagnosis has survived, but speculation ranges from secondary syphilis to glaucoma. Although he was just 39, his marksmanship and health were apparently in decline, and he had been arrested several times for vagrancy, despite earning a good income from gambling and displays of showmanship only a few years earlier.

===Marriage===
Hickok met Agnes Thatcher Lake, at the time 45 years old, on July 31, 1871. Lake, a widow and the proprietor of Lake&#x27;s Hippo-Olympiad circus, arrived in Abilene and went to the office of the town marshal to pay the performance fee. She and the circus departed the next day, but Lake and Hickok continued to correspond. On March 5, 1876, Hickok married Lake in Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory. Hickok left his new bride a few months later, joining Charlie Utter&#x27;s wagon train to seek his fortune in the gold fields of South Dakota.
Shortly before his death, Hickok wrote a letter to his new wife, which read in part, &quot;Agnes Darling, if such should be we never meet again, while firing my last shot, I will gently breathe the name of my wife—Agnes—and with wishes even for my enemies I will make the plunge and try to swim to the other shore.&quot;

Martha Jane Cannary, known popularly as Calamity Jane, claimed in her autobiography that she was married to Hickok and had divorced him so he could be free to marry Agnes Lake, but no records that support her account have been found. The two possibly met for the first time after Jane was released from the guardhouse in Fort Laramie and joined the wagon train in which Hickok was traveling. The wagon train arrived in Deadwood in July 1876. Jane confirmed this account in an 1896 newspaper interview, although she claimed she had been hospitalized with illness rather than in the guardhouse.

==Death==
On August 1, 1876, Hickok was playing poker at Nuttal &amp; Mann&#x27;s Saloon No. 10 in Deadwood, Dakota Territory. When a seat opened up at the table, a drunk man named Jack McCall sat down to play. McCall lost heavily. Hickok encouraged McCall to quit the game until he could cover his losses and offered to give him money for breakfast. Although McCall accepted the money, he was apparently insulted.

The next day, Hickok was playing poker again. He usually sat with his back to a wall so he could see the entrance, but the only seat available when he joined the game was a chair facing away from the door. He twice asked another man at the table, Charles Rich, to change seats with him, but Rich refused. McCall then entered the saloon, walked up behind Hickok, drew his Colt Model 1873 Single Action Army .45-caliber revolver and shouted, &quot;Take that!&quot; as he shot Hickok in the back of the head at point-blank range.

Hickok died instantly. The bullet emerged through his right cheek and struck Captain [William] Massie in the left wrist. Hickok may have told his friend Charlie Utter and others who were traveling with them that he thought he would be killed while in Deadwood.

Hickok was playing five-card stud or five-card draw when he was shot. He was holding two pairs: black aces and black eights (although there is some dispute as to the suit of one of the aces, diamond vs. spade) as his &quot;up cards&quot;, which has since become widely known as the &quot;dead man&#x27;s hand&quot;. The identity of the fifth card (his &quot;hole card&quot;) is also the subject of debate.

===Jack McCall&#x27;s two trials===
McCall&#x27;s motive for killing Hickok is the subject of speculation, largely concerning McCall&#x27;s anger at Hickok&#x27;s having given him money for breakfast the day before, after McCall had lost heavily.

McCall was summoned before an informal &quot;miners&#x27; jury&quot; (an &quot;ad hoc&quot; local group of miners and businessmen). He claimed he was avenging Hickok&#x27;s earlier slaying of his brother, which may have been true; a man named Lew McCall had indeed been killed by an unknown lawman in Abilene, Kansas, but whether or not the two McCall men were related is unknown. McCall was acquitted of the murder, which prompted editorializing in the &quot;Black Hills Pioneer&quot;: &quot;Should it ever be our misfortune to kill a man ... we would simply ask that our trial may take place in some of the mining camps of these hills.&quot; Calamity Jane is reputed to have led a mob that threatened McCall with lynching, but at the time of Hickok&#x27;s death, Jane was actually being held by military authorities.

After bragging about killing Hickok, McCall was rearrested. The second trial was not considered double jeopardy because of the irregular jury in the first trial and because Deadwood was at the time in unorganized Indian country. The new trial was held in Yankton, the capital of the Dakota Territory. Hickok&#x27;s brother, Lorenzo Butler, traveled from Illinois to attend the retrial. McCall was found guilty and sentenced to death.

Leander Richardson, a reporter, interviewed McCall shortly before his execution, and wrote an article about him for the April 1877 issue of &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;. Lorenzo Butler Hickok spoke with McCall after the trial, and said McCall showed no remorse.

Jack McCall was hanged on March 1, 1877, and buried in a Roman Catholic cemetery. The cemetery was moved in 1881, and when McCall&#x27;s body was exhumed, the noose was found still around his neck.

===Burial===

Charlie Utter, Hickok&#x27;s friend and companion, claimed Hickok&#x27;s body and placed a notice in the local newspaper, the &quot;Black Hills Pioneer&quot;, which read:
Almost the entire town attended the funeral, and Utter had Hickok buried with a wooden grave marker reading:
Hickok is known to have fatally shot six men and is suspected of having killed a seventh (McCanles). Despite his reputation, Hickok was buried in the Ingelside Cemetery, Deadwood&#x27;s original graveyard. This cemetery filled quickly, and in 1879, on the third anniversary of Hickok&#x27;s original burial, Utter paid to move Hickok&#x27;s remains to the new Mount Moriah Cemetery. Utter supervised the move and noted that, while perfectly preserved, Hickok had been imperfectly embalmed. As a result, calcium carbonate from the surrounding soil had replaced the flesh, leading to petrifaction. One of the workers, Joseph McLintock, wrote a detailed description of the reinterment. McLintock used a cane to tap the body, face, and head, finding no soft tissue anywhere. He noted that the sound was similar to tapping a brick wall and believed the remains weighed more than . William Austin, the cemetery caretaker, estimated . This made it difficult for the men to carry the remains to the new site. The original wooden grave marker was moved to the new site, but by 1891, it had been destroyed by souvenir hunters whittling pieces from it, and it was replaced with a statue. This, in turn, was destroyed by souvenir hunters and replaced in 1902 by a life-sized sandstone sculpture of Hickok. This, too, was badly defaced, and was then enclosed in a cage for protection. The enclosure was cut open by souvenir hunters in the 1950s, and the statue was removed.

Hickok is currently interred in a square plot at the Mount Moriah Cemetery, surrounded by a cast-iron fence, with a U.S. flag flying nearby. The flag never goes down on Mt. Moriah Cemetery, as Deadwood was granted permission by the U.S. Congress during World War I to fly the flag 24 hours a day to honor all veterans who have served their country.

Calamity Jane was reported to have been buried next to Hickok according to her dying wish. Four of the men on the self-appointed committee who planned Calamity&#x27;s funeral (Albert Malter, Frank Ankeney, Jim Carson, and Anson Higby) later stated that, since Hickok had &quot;absolutely no use&quot; for Jane in this life, they decided to play a posthumous joke on him by laying her to rest by his side.

===Pistols known to have been carried by Hickok===
Hickok&#x27;s favorite guns were a pair of Colt 1851 Navy Model (.36 caliber) cap-and-ball revolvers. They had ivory grips and nickel plating, and were ornately engraved with &quot;J.B. Hickok–1869&quot; on the backstrap. He wore his revolvers butt-forward in a belt or sash (when wearing city clothes or buckskins, respectively), and seldom used holsters; he drew the pistols using a &quot;reverse&quot;, &quot;twist&quot;, or cavalry draw, as would a cavalryman. As Marshal of Hays, Hickok had an Adams and Deane percussion .44-caliber pistol.

At the time of his death, Hickok was wearing a Smith &amp; Wesson Model No. 2 Army revolver, a five-shot, single-action, .32-caliber weapon, innovative as one of the first metallic cartridge firearms and favored by many Union officers during the Civil War. Bonhams auction company offered this pistol at auction on November 18, 2013, in San Francisco, California, described as Hickok&#x27;s Smith &amp; Wesson No. 2, serial number 29963, a .32 rimfire with a six-inch barrel, blued finish, and varnished rosewood grips. The gun did not sell because the highest bid of $220,000 was less than the reserve set by the gun&#x27;s owners. A second pistol Hickok had at his death was a Sharps Model 1859 .32-caliber four-barreled rim-fire derringer.

==In popular culture==
Hickok has remained one of the most popular and iconic figures of the American Old West, and is still frequently depicted in popular culture, including literature, film, and television.

Paramount Pictures&#x27; Western silent film &quot;Wild Bill Hickok&quot; (released on November 18, 1923) was directed by Clifford Smith and stars William S. Hart as Hickok. A print of the film is maintained in the Museum of Modern Art film archive.

The movie &quot;The Plainsman&quot; (1936), starring Gary Cooper as Hickok, features the alleged romance between Calamity Jane and him as its main plot line. It is a loose adaptation of Hickok&#x27;s life, ending with his famous aces-and-eights card hand. A later film (1953) and subsequent stage musical, both titled &quot;Calamity Jane&quot;, also portray a romance between Calamity Jane and Hickok. In the film version, Howard Keel co-stars as Hickok to Doris Day&#x27;s Calamity Jane.

&quot;Prairie Schooners&quot; is a 1940 American Western film directed by Sam Nelson, which stars Wild Bill Elliott as Hickok.

In 1954, an episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; on CBS radio featured John Dehner as Hickok. Hickok was sent from Abilene to arrest Matt Dillon (William Conrad) for the murder of a man he had thrown out of Dodge earlier that month. In the episode Dillon and Hickok are old friends.

&quot;The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok&quot; was a 1950s TV series starring Guy Madison and Andy Devine.

&quot;The White Buffalo&quot; (1977), starring Charles Bronson as Hickok, tells a tale of Hickok&#x27;s hunt for a murderous white buffalo that follows him in his nightmares.

A highly fictional film account of Hickok&#x27;s later years and death, titled &quot;Wild Bill&quot; (1995), stars Jeff Bridges as Hickok and David Arquette as Jack McCall, and was written and directed by Walter Hill.

An episode of the 1963-1964 TV series &quot;The Great Adventure&quot; featured Lloyd Bridges (Jeff&#x27;s father) as Hickok.

Also in 1995, he&#x27;s depicted as a character in an episode of &quot;Legend (TV series)&quot; by William Russ. The episode correctly relates Hickok&#x27;s vision problems late in his life, and also includes his murderer, Jack McCall, in a highly fictionalized role. It ends with Hickok surviving the murder attempt due to wearing body armor when shot in the back, then secretly leaving for a ranch in California. Since he was actually shot in the back of the head, that plot element is a complete artifice of the episode writers.

A semifictionalized version of Hickok&#x27;s time as marshal of Abilene, Kansas, titled &quot;Hickok&quot; (2017), stars Luke Hemsworth as Hickok, Trace Adkins as the Bull&#x27;s Head Saloon keeper Phil Coe, Kris Kristofferson as Abilene mayor George Knox, and Kaiwi Lyman-Mersereau as John Wesley Hardin. It was written by Michael Lanahan and directed by Timothy Woodward Jr.

In the early 1990s ABC television series &quot;Young Riders&quot;, a fictional account of Pony Express riders, Hickok is portrayed by Josh Brolin.

In the HBO series &quot;Deadwood&quot; (2004–2006), Wild Bill is played by Keith Carradine.

Hickok is a playable character in the 2018 board game &quot;Deadwood 1876&quot; by Façade Games.

In &quot;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs&quot;, Scruggs refuses to play the dead man&#x27;s hand upon entering a game of poker.

===Memorials and honorable distinctions===
Hickok&#x27;s birthplace is now the Wild Bill Hickok Memorial and is a listed historic site under the supervision of the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. The town of Deadwood, South Dakota, re-enacts Hickok&#x27;s murder and McCall&#x27;s capture every summer evening. In 1979, Hickok was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame.

<text>Online service provider law is a summary and case law tracking page for laws, legal decisions and issues relating to online service providers (OSPs), like the Wikipedia and Internet service providers, from the viewpoint of an OSP considering its liability and customer service issues. See Cyber law for broader coverage of the law of cyberspace.

==United States==
The general liability risk within the United States is low but it&#x27;s necessary to review the laws and decisions of all other countries because the extraterritorial application of laws to content hosted in the US is a significant concern.

===Libel, defamation===
*1991 &quot;Cubby v. CompuServe&quot; held that CompuServe wasn&#x27;t the publisher and granted summary judgment in its favor.
*May 1995 &quot;Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co.&quot; decision which held that Prodigy &quot;was&quot; the publisher, because it could delete messages.
*1996 Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which states in part that &quot;No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider&quot;. Note that this portion of the CDA was not struck down and remains law.
*November 1997 Zeran v. AOL The CDA protects AOL even though it repeatedly ignored a defamation complaint.
*April 1998 &quot;Blumenthal v. AOL&quot; (part of the case against Drudge and AOL) held that the CDA protects AOL for Drudge&#x27;s writing that Blumenthal, an assistant to the US President, had a spousal abuse background (retracted in two days) even though it paid Drudge US$3,000 a month for his columns, had editorial control and might well have been liable if it was not an online publication .
*&quot;Lunney v. Prodigy Services Co.&quot; 94 N.Y.2d 242 (1999) held that internet chatroom provider was not considered a publisher of defamatory material posted from an impostor account due to Prodigy&#x27;s passive role.
*2003 &quot;Carafano v. Metrosplash.com&quot; (the Star Trek actress case) . Providing multiple choice options in forms doesn&#x27;t invalidate CDA immunity.

Immunity under Section 230 requires that: (1) the defendant is a provider or user of an interactive computer service; (2) the cause of action treat the defendant as a publisher or speaker of information; and (3) the information at issue be provided by another information content provider. Zeran, 129 F.3d at 330. Even completely ignoring a complaint has generally been found not to garner liability, so protection appears to be very comprehensive, though it still doesn&#x27;t stop people from trying.

In 2002, the California Court of Appeal held that CDA Section 230 does not apply to distributor liability, meaning that a defendant who had notice of a defamatory statement must stop publishing it or face liability. Barrett v. Rosenthal, 114 Cal. App.4th 1379 (2002). The California Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision overturned, holding that Rosenthal was a &quot;user of interactive computer services&quot; and therefore immune from liability under Section 230. See also Grace v. eBay, Inc., 2004 WL 1632047 (Cal. Ct. App. Jul. 22, 2004) (no immunity against liability for a distributor of information who knew or had reason to know that the information was defamatory). Grace v. eBay was resolved without an opinion. The lower courts in Grace and Barrett had reached opposite conclusions when they were appealed to the California Supreme Court. In taking these cases, it was deciding to uphold or reverse Blumenthal v. AOL. Blumenthal, noted the conference report comment that the clear intent of the CDA was to overrule the state decision in Stratton-Oakmont v. Prodigy and opined that accepting distributor liability would expose them to liability that Congress had clearly intended to protect them from.

===Patent, trademark, right of publicity, trade secret===
*Communications Decency Act

The CDA does not &quot;limit or expand any law pertaining to intellectual property&quot; 47 U.S.C. Section 230(e)(2); see also Gucci America, Inc. v. Hall &amp; Associates, 135 F. Supp. 2d 409 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (no immunity for contributory liability for trademark infringement); Perfect 10, Inc. v CCBill LLC (No. CV 02-7624 LGB) (C.D. Cal. 22 June 2004) (state right of publicity claim is not covered by Section 230); but see Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, Inc., 339 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 2003) (dismissing, inter alia, right of publicity claim under Section 230 without discussion).

Courts have not yet addressed whether a state law trade secret claim is a &quot;law pertaining to intellectual property.&quot;

*List of leading legal cases in copyright law

The OCILLA can provide a safe harbor for OSPs who comply with its requirements. As noted above, CDA Section 230 does not provide protection against a copyright claim.

If the OSP does not fall under OCILLA&#x27;s safe harbor, it still may be protected. In Religious Technology Center v. Netcom On-Line Communication Services, Inc., 907 F. Supp. 1361 (N. D. Cal. 1995), an internet services provider who merely transmitted material that infringed the plaintiff’s copyright was held not liable. See also CoStar Group, Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc., 373 F.3d 544 (4th Cir., 2004)

===Defamation===
The permanent nature of the internet and the fact that regulation of what people post is almost impossible to maintain can lead to many dangerous situations. And when these slanderous accusations cause damage to an injured party, they can be classified as &quot;Online Defamation&quot;.

The first case considering online defamation was in &quot;Godfrey v. Demon Internet Service&quot; [1999] 4 All ER 342, [2001] QB 201 (QBD). An anonymous poster impersonated a physics lecturer and posted a defamatory comments on a &quot;Usenet&quot; newsgroup. The posting remained online for several weeks even after the real lecturer made requests to take it down. The issue was whether the service provider had &#x27;published&#x27; the posting. The Court held &quot;ISPs do not participate in the process of publication as such but merely act as facilitators...&quot;. However, in Godfrey, it was held that the ISP could be held liable at common law if it had been notified of a defamatory posting, and was so rendered responsible for publication from that moment onwards.

The later case of &quot;Bunt v. Tilley &amp; Ors&quot; [2006] EWHC 407 (QB), concerned a claim for alleged defamation against the ISPs who hosted websites containing defamatory material. The court found that the ISPs were merely passive facilitators rather than actively procuring the commission of the tort like a publisher. No defamation was ever proven.

As of 1 January 2014, changes to UK defamation laws will come into force, with the &quot;Defamation Act 2013&quot; and accompanying &quot;Defamation (Operators of Websites) Regulations 2013&quot;. in which operators of web sites are not liable for defamation claims against them for user generated content (e.g. comments on a forum posted by users) provided they take certain actions within reasonable timeframes when notified of the offending content. Where the author cannot be contacted, (e.g. if the posting is anonymous or the user has supplied obviously bogus contact details), the website operator must take the content down or they can be liable.

:Section 5 of the Defamation Act 2013 (c.26) provides a defence for the operator of a website where a defamation action is brought in respect of a statement posted on that website if it was not the operator who posted the statement. The defence can be defeated if the claimant can show that it was not possible for them to identify the person posting the statement, the claimant gave the operator a notice of complaint in relation to that statement and the operator did not respond to the notice of complaint in accordance with these regulations.

===Copyright===
According to section 1 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, a work is eligible for copyright protection if it is:

&quot;1 Copyright and copyright works

(1) Copyright is a property right which subsists in accordance with this Part in the following descriptions of work?&lt;br&gt;
(a) original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works,&lt;br&gt;
(b) sound recordings, films or broadcasts, and&lt;br&gt;
(c) the typographical arrangement of published editions.&lt;br&gt;
(2) In this Part &quot;copyright work&quot; means a work of any of those descriptions in which copyright subsists.&lt;br&gt;
(3) Copyright does not subsist in a work unless the requirements of this Part with respect to qualification for copyright protection are met (see section 153 and the provisions referred to there).&quot;

According to the UK Patent Office website, the definition of &#x27;original&#x27; is the following:

&quot;A work can only be original if it is the result of independent creative effort. It will not be original if it has been copied from something that already exists. If it is similar to something that already exists but there has been no copying from the existing work either directly or indirectly, then it may be original.

The term &#x27;original&#x27; also involves a test of substantiality - literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works will not be original if there has not been sufficient skill and labour expended in their creation. But, sometimes significant investment of resources without significant intellectual input can still count as sufficient skill and labour.

Ultimately, only the courts can decide whether something is original, but there is much case law indicating, for example, that names and titles do not have sufficient substantiality to be original and that, where an existing work is widely known, it will be difficult to convince a court that there has been no copying if your work is very similar or identical.

Sound recordings, films and published editions do not have to be original but they will not be new copyright works if they have been copied from existing sound recordings, films and published editions.

Broadcasts do not have to be original, but there will be no copyright, if, or to the extent that, they infringe copyright in another broadcast.&quot;

The other relevant portion of the Act in question is section 153:

&quot;153 Qualification for copyright protection&lt;br&gt;
(1) Copyright does not subsist in a work unless the qualification requirements of this Chapter are satisfied as regards?&lt;br&gt;
(a) the author (see section 154), or&lt;br&gt;
(b) the country in which the work was first published (see section 155), or&lt;br&gt;
(c) in the case of a broadcast, the country from which the broadcast was made (see section 156).&lt;br&gt;
(2) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to Crown copyright or Parliamentary copyright (see sections 163 to 166B) or to copyright subsisting
by virtue of section 168 (copyright of certain international organisations).&lt;br&gt;
(3) If the qualification requirements of this Chapter, or section 163, 165 or 168, are once satisfied in respect of a work, copyright does not cease to subsist by reason of any subsequent event.&quot;

This section controls the nationality and country of origin requirements for copyright. It is roughly comparable with US law, since both countries are signatories to the Berne Convention.

====Crown copyright====
Photographs created before 1 June 1957 have a 50-year copyright period, as do other works except engravings. Photographs published before August 1989 also have a 50-year copyright period.

==Japan==
On 27 May 2002, so-called Provider Liability Limitation Law (プロバイダ責任法 or プロバイダ責任制限法) was enacted. It is said that the major purpose of the law is to limit the liability of ISPs, administrators and system operators of bulletin boards, hosting services, and others. The law covers copyright violation, defamation, and obscenity among other things. Regarding those contents that have to be removed, the law holds that the service providers cannot be held liable, unless 1) they have the technological means to remove the content, and either 2-a) they have the knowledge of the illegal content, or 2-b) they could reasonably have gotten to know it. It also specifies circumstances under which service providers may offer personal information of a user to another.

Major cases preceding the law include &quot;Niftyserve Case&quot;, in which a system operator/ moderator of an online forum was found to be liable for not removing a series of defamatory postings. The system operator was not requested by the defamed participant to remove the content, but had the knowledge of the content. The court found it to be an important ground for the liability.

==Canada==
In Canada, there is no legislation addressing liability for online service providers; and few cases.

In &quot;Carter v. BC Federation of Foster Parents Association&quot;, 2004 BCSC 137, a case on a service provider&#x27;s liability for an anonymous forum posting, the Court cited the US cases of &quot;Cubby v. Compuserve&quot; and &quot;Lunney v. Prodigy Services&quot; with approval for its editorial control test.

Where a defamatory statement is found, a service provider may avail themselves to a defence of innocent dissemination - as set out in the English case of &quot;Vizetelly v. Mudie’s Select Library Ltd.&quot;, [1900] 2 Q.B. 17.

<doc id="377038" wikidata="Q4773920" url="?curid=377038" title="Anthropophage">
<text>An anthropophage or anthropophagus (from , &quot;human-eater&quot;, plural ) was a member of a mythical race of cannibals described by the playwright William Shakespeare. The word first appears in English after 1460.

== Origin ==
The Anthropophagi might have been inspired by the Scythian tribe of the Androphagi described by the Ancient Greek author Herodotus of Halicarnassus.

Ephraim Chambers&#x27; Cyclopædia says &quot;Many, some say most, of the &quot;Savages&quot; are &quot;Anthropophagi&quot;.&quot;

== In literature ==
The most famous usage of the Anthropophagi appears in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;:

Shakespeare makes yet another reference to the cannibalist &quot;anthropophagus&quot; in the &quot;Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;:

T.H. White also features the Anthropophagi as Robin Hood&#x27;s enemies in his novel &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;:

American novelist Rick Yancey incorporates the myths of the Anthropophagi in his 2010 release &quot;The Monstrumologist&quot;.

== Pop culture ==
In popular culture, the &quot;anthropophagus&quot; is sometimes depicted as a being without a head, but instead have their faces on the torso. This may be a misinterpretation based on Shakespeare&#x27;s writings in &quot;Othello&quot;, where the &quot;anthropophagi&quot; are mistaken to be described by the immediate following line, &quot;and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders&quot;. In reality, the line actually refers to a separate, different race of mythical beings known as the Blemmyes, who are indeed said to have no head, and have their facial features on the chest.

<text>Young God Records is an independent record label formed by Michael Gira in 1990 that specializes in experimental, avant-garde and often non genre-specific releases. The label was named after an EP released by Gira&#x27;s band Swans called &quot;Young God&quot;.

The label&#x27;s original intent was to facilitate the release of Swans&#x27; music, but while the band was disbanded Young God grew to host the Angels of Light as well as a number of other unique bands and artists, including: Akron/Family, Devendra Banhart, Lisa Germano, Ulan Bator, and Mi and L&#x27;au. Swans was re-formed in 2010, and began again releasing music under the Young God label. In 2012, Gira told Pitchfork that Young God would not be putting out any new albums by other bands, citing the decline in revenue.

<doc id="377045" wikidata="Q844308" url="?curid=377045" title="EMILY's List">
<text>EMILYs List is an American political action committee (PAC) that aims to help elect Democratic female candidates in favor of abortion rights to office. It was founded by Ellen Malcolm in 1985. The group&#x27;s name is an acronym for &quot;Early Money Is Like Yeast&quot;. Malcolm commented that &quot;it makes the dough rise&quot;. The saying refers to a convention of political fundraising: receiving many donations early in a race helps attract subsequent donors. EMILYs List bundles contributions to the campaigns of Democratic women in favor of abortion rights running in targeted races.

From 1985 through 2008, EMILYs List raised $240 million for political candidates. EMILYs List spent $27.4 million in 2010, $34 million in 2012, and $44.9 million in 2014. The organization was on track to raise $60 million for the 2016 election cycle, much of it earmarked for Hillary Clinton, whose presidential bid EMILYs List had endorsed.

==History and mission==

EMILYs List was founded in 1985 when 25 women met in the home of Ellen Malcolm. Founding members included Barbara Boxer, Ann Richards, Anne Wexler, and Donna Shalala. In 1986, early financial support from EMILYs List helped elect Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, the first female Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in her own right (not appointed or filling a seat of a deceased husband).

The group&#x27;s mission is to cultivate a donor network to raise money for female Democratic candidates in favor of abortion rights. To become an official EMILY&#x27;s List member, an individual must pay $100 to join EMILYs List and agree to donate a minimum of $100 each to two U.S. Senate, U.S. House, or gubernatorial candidates. Members donate directly to EMILY&#x27;s List, which bundles the checks together and forwards them to candidates.

In her book, &quot;When Women Win: EMILYs List and the Rise of Women in American Politics&quot;, Ellen Malcolm, the organization&#x27;s founder, stated that &quot;creating progressive policies and promoting them can be incredibly valuable. But those policies will never be implemented unless enough politicians are elected who support them.&quot; They focused specifically on women in favor of abortion rights because they felt that &quot;women couldn&#x27;t be equal until they had control over their bodies.&quot;

They focused on raising early money for women because women were not getting money from the Democratic party and thus were generally not winning races even if they were qualified, and they felt that early money could help convince people that their campaigns were credible and would help them raise more money later.

For the 2006 election cycle, EMILYs List raised about $46 million for candidates and the group was listed as the biggest PAC in the nation by &quot;Political Money Line&quot;. EMILY&#x27;s List endorsed 31 candidates in 2006, eight of whom were victorious.

In 2008, EMILYs List endorsed 22 U.S. House candidates, two U.S. Senate candidates, and three gubernatorial contenders. The PAC helped elect two new female senators, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and supported the gubernatorial election of Bev Perdue of North Carolina, the re-election of Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington, and the successful elections of twelve new women to the United States House of Representatives.

EMILYs List criteria for picking candidates include staff recommendations, viability, &quot;demographics and history of the district, analysis of opponents or potential opponents, analysis of candidate&#x27;s education, political experience, etc., demonstrated success at fund-raising, poll data to demonstrate name recognition and grass roots support.&quot;

==Staff==
Ellen Malcolm served as president of EMILYs List from its founding until 2010. Stephanie Schriock was chosen to succeed Malcolm, who became chairwoman of the board of directors. Schriock announced she would step down in late 2020, following 11 years at the organization. 

Laphonza Butler took over as president of EMILYs List in 2021, leaving in October 2023 to fill the remainder of the late Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s U.S. Senate term. Political strategist Jessica Mackler was selected as interim president following Butler&#x27;s Senate appointment, and her position as fourth president of EMILYs List was made permanent in March 2024. 

Emily Cain has served as Executive Director since 2017. Amy Dacey was the executive director of EMILYs List from 2010 through 2013. 

The organization&#x27;s board of directors includes Ellen Malcolm, Rebecca Haile, Yolanda Caraway, Yvette Nicole Brown, Maya Harris, María Teresa Kumar, Wendy Greuel, Judith Lichtman, and Donald Sussman.

==Programs==
The Political Opportunity Program (POP) was established in 2001 to encourage Democratic women in favor of abortion rights to run for state and local office. POP targets its resources toward Democratic women in favor of abortion rights running for state legislatures, state constitutional offices, and local offices.

=== &quot;Women Vote!&quot; ===
In 1995, EMILYs List began a program called &quot;Women Vote!&quot; to promote a higher voter turnout among women. Women Vote! is Emily&#x27;s List&#x27;s independent expenditure arm communicating directly with voters.

==Criticism==
Critics would like to see EMILYs List expand its definition of &quot;women&#x27;s issues&quot; to include economic issues like a higher minimum wage and expanded Social Security. Others have said that the group needs to focus its resources better, staying out of races where there is already an incumbent progressive Democrat and concentrating on other races instead. Democrat Marcy Kaptur criticized EMILYs List for being too narrow in focus by emphasizing abortion rights over other progressive issues, such as the minimum wage, that also affect women.

EMILYs List in the past has received some criticism for how much money they are accepting and where that money is going to as being a Political Action Committee or PAC. In Nick Hoffman&#x27;s article EMILYs List v. FEC he discusses EMILYs List as a non-profit that has had trouble with the Federal Election Commission or FEC. Hoffman accuses EMILYs List of arguing with the FEC over how much money should be allowed to be given to campaigns. EMILYs List has been criticized for pushing the allowance of no limit on how much money can be donated to campaigns.

==Endorsements==

=== Endorsed candidates ===
EMILYs List provides training, recruits women to run, and endorses and funds female political candidates. EMILYs List is listed as an &quot;important source of candidate support,&quot; in a 2010 article in the &quot;Harvard International Review&quot;.

===Presidential===
During the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, EMILYs List supported Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama and bundled $855,518 for Clinton, making the group one of the five largest donors to her 2008 campaign. When NARAL endorsed Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton, EMILY&#x27;s List was strongly critical. EMILYs List President Ellen Malcolm said, &quot;I think it is tremendously disrespectful to Sen. Clinton - who held up the nomination of a FDA commissioner in order to force approval of Plan B and who spoke so eloquently during the Supreme Court nomination about the importance of protecting Roe vs. Wade - to not give her the courtesy to finish the final three weeks of the primary process. It certainly must be disconcerting for elected leaders who stand up for reproductive rights and expect the choice community will stand with them.&quot; After the conclusion of the Democratic presidential primaries, EMILYs List moved their support to Barack Obama and was vocal in their opposition to the McCain/Palin ticket.

In 2013, EMILYs List launched its Madam President campaign, saying, &quot;There is a mandate for women&#x27;s leadership in this country. But we have yet to break through the final glass ceiling and put a woman at the top of the Democratic ticket and into the Presidency.&quot; 

Accordingly, EMILYs List endorsed Hillary Clinton for president on April 12, 2015 within hours of Clinton forming an exploratory committee to run for president. Madame President came to house the former social media presences of Ready for Hillary PAC which did grassroots organizing in preparation for Hillary Clinton&#x27;s presidential candidacy.

In the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries EMILYs List endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren the day before Super Tuesday.

===2012===
In 2012, 80% of the candidates endorsed by EMILYs List in the general election won a seat.

===2014===
In the 2014 election cycle, EMILYs List endorsed 24 U.S. House candidates, six U.S. Senate candidates, and six gubernatorial candidates. Of these 40 candidates endorsed by EMILY&#x27;s List, 42.5% won.

=== 2018 ===
In the 2018 election, EMILYs List endorsed eight women in gubernatorial races, 12 for the U.S. Senate, and 64 candidates for the House of Representatives.

==Similar groups==
Similar groups have formed along the same lines as EMILYs List, with some slight variations. In 1994, Joan Kirner created a similar organization in Australia by the name EMILY&#x27;s List Australia. Political activist and former school teacher Amy Laufer founded Virginia&#x27;s List, a political group supporting Democratic women running for office in Virginia.

EMILYs List&#x27;s conservative counterparts include: The Wish List, which supports Republican women in favor of abortion rights; Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion PAC that supports women who oppose abortion; and Maggie&#x27;s List, a PAC founded in Florida in 2010 to &quot;raise awareness and funds to increase the number of conservative women elected to federal public office.&quot;

<text>In common law legal systems, original jurisdiction of a court is the power to hear a case for the first time, as opposed to appellate jurisdiction, when a higher court has the power to review a lower court&#x27;s decision. 

==India==

In India, the Supreme Court has original, appellate and advisory jurisdiction. Its exclusive original jurisdiction extends to all cases between the Government of India and the States of India or between Government of India and states on one side and one or more states on the other side or cases between different states. Original jurisdiction is related to cases directly brought to the Supreme Court. Cases that require the interpretation of the constitution or cases relating to the denial of fundamental rights are heard in the Supreme Court. In case there is a dispute between two or more states or between the union and the states, the Supreme Court decides such cases. In addition, Article 131 of the Constitution of India grants original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court on all cases involving the enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens. It is empowered to issue directions, orders or writs, including writs like habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari to enforce them.

The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court can be invoked by a certificate granted by the High Court concerned under Article 132(1), 133(1) or 134 of the Constitution in respect of any judgement, decree or final order of a High Court in both civil and criminal cases, involving substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Indian Constitution.

The Supreme Court has special advisory jurisdiction in matters that may specifically be referred to by the president of India under Article 143 of the Indian Constitution.

==United States==
===Supreme Court===

In the United States, courts having original jurisdiction are referred to as trial courts. In certain types of cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has original jurisdiction concurrently with lower courts. The original jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court is governed by
Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution and Title 28 of the United States Code, section 1251. Most commonly, original jurisdiction cases involve suits between states as parties, usually over territorial or water rights disputes.

The United States Constitution defines Original Jurisdiction thus: 
===Federal and state courts===
In the federal court system and those of most U.S. states, there are several types of trial courts. That is, there are several specialized courts with original jurisdiction over specific types of matters, and then a court with original jurisdiction over anything not reserved to more specialized courts.

===Special courts===
Not all &quot;trial courts&quot; exclusively exercise original jurisdiction. Indeed, in both the federal and most state court systems, the trial courts of &quot;general jurisdiction&quot; hear appeals from trial courts of limited original jurisdiction; many states call these courts &quot;superior courts&quot; for this reason. For example, United States district courts hear appeals from their bankruptcy courts (which operate as quasi-independent units of district courts but are constitutionally separate Article I tribunals). Similarly, the Law Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey hears appeals from Pittsburgh have unique systems) and from certain agencies of local (e.g., zoning board) and state governments (e.g., Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board).

<text>Play piercing, needle play, or recreational acupuncture is body piercing done for the purpose of enjoying the experience rather than producing a permanent body decoration. Needles, sharpened bones, or other tools used in play piercing are removed from the body when the episode is complete, allowing the wounds to heal. Those who engage in play piercing may do so for self-expression, imitating tribal rituals , spiritual self-discovery, sexual pleasure, or entertainment.

Play piercing as part of a BDSM scene can produce an endorphin high, which can last for hours and can induce orgasm in many of the people who experience it. The experience of multiple piercings in an erotically or spiritually charged context is qualitatively very different from the experience most people have had with phlebotomists in medical settings, in part because the needle is placed &#x27;through&#x27; the skin at a secant so that both ends are accessible, rather than &#x27;into&#x27; the skin.

Play piercing should always be carried out using new sterile hypodermic needles or acupuncture needles on skin which has been cleaned with an antiseptic such as alcohol or povidone iodine (which is a potential allergen), by people who have been properly trained. Improper technique can result in the transmission of bloodborne diseases (due to needlestick injuries, for example) or puncture wounds, but if done correctly there is far less danger of injury or infection than from being scratched by a cat due to the depth of insertion being controlled and the use of a sterilized needle.

Needles may be arranged in aesthetically pleasing configurations such as a smiley face, may be laced together like a corset, or may be used to sew on temporary decorations such as bells using sterile thread. Twisting of the needle(s) or pulling them away from the skin will also result a different type of sensation.

A more extreme form of play piercing is flesh hook suspension where a person is suspended vertically or horizontally by one or more hooks through their flesh. This practice is done in some cultures as a rite of passage or as part of a BDSM performance. There are also dance rituals in which flesh hooks attached to multiple people are attached together.

<text>The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) is a member of the United States Intelligence Community and an agency of the United States Department of Defense which designs, builds, launches, and operates the reconnaissance satellites of the U.S. federal government. It provides satellite intelligence to several government agencies, particularly signals intelligence (SIGINT) to the National Security Agency (NSA), imagery intelligence (IMINT) to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The NRO announced in 2023 that it plans within the following decade to quadruple the number of satellites it operates and increase the number of signals and images it delivers by a factor of ten.

NRO is considered, along with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), NSA, DIA, and NGA, to be one of the &quot;big five&quot; U.S. intelligence agencies. The NRO is headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, south of the Washington Dulles International Airport.

The Director of the NRO reports to both the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense. The NRO&#x27;s federal workforce is a hybrid organization consisting of some 3,000 personnel including NRO cadre, Air Force, Army, CIA, NGA, NSA, Navy and US Space Force personnel. A 1996 bipartisan commission report described the NRO as having by far the largest budget of any intelligence agency, and &quot;virtually no federal workforce&quot;, accomplishing most of its work through &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of defense contractor personnel. From its founding in 1961 the NRO&#x27;s existence was classified and not revealed publicly until 1992.

==Mission==
The National Reconnaissance Office develops, builds, launches, and operates space reconnaissance systems and conducts intelligence-related activities for U.S. national security.

The NRO also coordinates collection and analysis of information from airplane and satellite reconnaissance by the military services and the Central Intelligence Agency. It is funded through the National Reconnaissance Program, which is part of the National Intelligence Program (formerly known as the National Foreign Intelligence Program). The agency is part of the Department of Defense.

The NRO works closely with its intelligence and space partners, which include the National Security Agency (NSA), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the United States Strategic Command, the United States Space Command, Naval Research Laboratory, and other agencies and organizations.

==History==


The NRO was established on August 25, 1960, after management problems and insufficient progress with the USAF satellite reconnaissance program (see SAMOS and MIDAS). The formation was based on a 25 August 1960 recommendation to President Dwight D. Eisenhower during a special National Security Council meeting, and the agency was to coordinate the USAF and CIA&#x27;s (and later the navy and NSA&#x27;s) reconnaissance activities.

The NRO&#x27;s first photo reconnaissance satellite program was the Corona program, the existence of which was declassified February 24, 1995, and which existed from August 1960 to May 1972 (although the first test flight occurred on February 28, 1959). The Corona system used (sometimes multiple) film capsules dropped by satellites, which were recovered mid-air by military craft. The first successful recovery from space (Discoverer XIII) occurred on August 12, 1960, and the first image from space was seen six days later. The first imaging resolution was 8 meters, which was improved to 2 meters. Individual images covered, on average, an area of about . The last Corona mission (the 145th), was launched May 25, 1972, and this mission&#x27;s last images were taken May 31, 1972. From May 1962 to August 1964, the NRO conducted 12 mapping missions as part of the &quot;Argon&quot; system. Only seven were successful.
In 1963, the NRO conducted a mapping mission using higher resolution imagery, as part of the &quot;Lanyard&quot; program. The Lanyard program flew one successful mission.

NRO missions since 1972 are classified, and portions of many earlier programs remain unavailable to the public.

On August 18, 2000, the National Reconnaissance Office recognized its ten original Founders. They were: William O. Baker, Merton E. Davies, Sidney Drell, Richard L. Garwin, Amrom Harry Katz, James R. Killian, Edwin H. Land, Frank W. Lehan, William J. Perry, Edward M. Purcell. Although their early work was highly classified, this group of men went on to extraordinary public accomplishments, including a Secretary of Defense, a Nobel Laureate, a president of MIT, a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Science, a renowned planetary scientist, and more.

===Existence===
The NRO was first mentioned by the press in a 1971 New York Times article. The first official acknowledgement of NRO was a Senate committee report in October 1973, which inadvertently exposed the existence of the NRO. In 1985, a &quot;New York Times&quot; article revealed details on the operations of the NRO.

Despite news coverage of NRO&#x27;s existence, the United States intelligence community debated for 20 years whether to confirm the reports. The existence of the NRO was declassified on September 18, 1992, by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, as recommended by the Director of Central Intelligence. The brief press release did not mention the word &quot;satellite&quot;, and the agency did not confirm for several more years that it launched satellites on rockets.

===Funding controversy===
A &quot;Washington Post&quot; article in September 1995 reported that the NRO had quietly hoarded between $1 billion and $1.7 billion in unspent funds without informing the Central Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon, or Congress.

The CIA was in the midst of an inquiry into the NRO&#x27;s funding because of complaints that the agency had spent $300 million of hoarded funds from its classified budget to build a new headquarters building in Chantilly, Virginia, a year earlier.

In total, NRO had accumulated US$3.8 billion (inflation adjusted US$ billion in ) in forward funding. As a consequence, NRO&#x27;s three distinct accounting systems were merged.

The presence of the classified new headquarters was revealed by the Federation of American Scientists who obtained unclassified copies of the blueprints filed with the building permit application. After 9/11 those blueprints were apparently classified. The reports of an NRO slush fund were true. According to former CIA general counsel Jeffrey Smith, who led the investigation: &quot;Our inquiry revealed that the NRO had for years accumulated very substantial amounts as a &#x27;rainy day fund.&#x27;&quot;

===Future Imagery Architecture===
In 1999 the NRO embarked on a $25 billion project with Boeing entitled Future Imagery Architecture to create a new generation of imaging satellites. In 2002 the project was far behind schedule and would most likely cost $2 billion to $3 billion more than planned, according to NRO records. The government pressed forward with efforts to complete the project, but after two more years, several more review panels and billions more in expenditures, the project was killed in what a New York Times report called &quot;perhaps the most spectacular and expensive failure in the 50-year history of American spy satellite projects.&quot;

===Mid-2000s to present===

On August 23, 2001, Brian Patrick Regan, a civilian employee of TRW at NRO, was arrested at Dulles International Airport outside Washington while boarding a flight for Zurich. He was carrying coded information about Iraqi and Chinese missile sites. He also had the addresses of the Chinese and Iraqi Embassies in Switzerland and Austria. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole for offering to sell intelligence secrets to Iraq and China. 

In January 2008, the government announced that a reconnaissance satellite operated by the NRO would make an unplanned and uncontrolled re-entry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in the next several months. Satellite watching hobbyists said that it was likely the USA-193, built by Lockheed Martin Corporation, which failed shortly after achieving orbit in December 2006. On February 14, 2008, the Pentagon announced that rather than allowing the satellite to make an uncontrolled re-entry while still in one piece, it would instead be shot down by a missile fired from a Navy cruiser. The intercept took place on February 21, 2008, resulting in the satellite breaking up into multiple pieces.

In July 2008, the NRO declassified the existence of its Synthetic Aperture Radar satellites, citing difficulty in discussing the creation of the Space-Based Radar with the United States Air Force and other entities. In August 2009, FOIA archives were queried for a copy of the NRO video, &quot;Satellite Reconnaissance: Secret Eyes in Space.&quot; The seven-minute video chronicles the early days of the NRO and many of its early programs. It was proposed that the NRO share the imagery of the United States itself with the National Applications Office for domestic law enforcement purposes. The NAO was disestablished in 2009. The NRO is a non-voting associate member of the Civil Applications Committee (CAC). The CAC is an inter-agency committee that coordinates and oversees the Federal- Civil use of classified collections. The CAC was officially chartered in 1975 by the Office of the President to provide Federal- Civil agencies access to National Systems data in support of mission responsibilities. According to &quot;Asia Times Online&quot;, one important mission of NRO satellites is the tracking of non-US submarines on patrol or on training missions in the world&#x27;s oceans and seas. At the National Space Symposium in April 2010, NRO director General Bruce Carlson, United States Air Force (Retired) announced that until the end of 2011, NRO is embarking on &quot;the most aggressive launch schedule that this organization has undertaken in the last twenty-five years. There are a number of very large and very critical reconnaissance satellites that will go into orbit in the next year to a year and a half.&quot;

In 2012, a McClatchy investigation found that the NRO was possibly breaching ethical and legal boundaries by encouraging its polygraph examiners to extract personal and private information from DoD personnel during polygraph tests that were limited to counterintelligence issues. Allegations of abusive polygraph practices were brought forward by former NRO polygraph examiners. In 2014, an inspector general&#x27;s report concluded that NRO failed to report felony admissions of child sexual abuse to law enforcement authorities. NRO obtained these criminal admissions during polygraph testing but never forwarded the information to police. NRO&#x27;s failure to act in the public interest by reporting child sexual predators was first made public in 2012 by former NRO polygraph examiners. On August 30, 2019, Donald Trump tweeted an image of “the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran”. The image almost certainly came from a satellite known as USA 224, according to Marco Langbroek, a satellite tracker based in the Netherlands. The satellite was launched by the National Reconnaissance Office in 2011. On January 31, 2020, Rocket Lab successfully launched a NROL-151 payload for the NRO. 

On December 19, 2020, NROL-108 was successfully launched aboard SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon 9 rocket. On July 15, 2020, NROL-149 was successfully launched aboard the first launch of Northrop Grumman&#x27;s new Minotaur IV rocket. On April 27, 2021, NROL-82 was successfully launched aboard United Launch Alliance’s Delta IV rocket. On June 15, 2021, NROL-111, a set of three classified satellites, was successfully launched aboard a Northrop Grumman Minotaur I rocket. On July 13, 2022, NROL-162 was launched aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from Mahia, New Zealand. On September 24, 2022, NROL-91 (USA 338) was launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base&#x27;s Space Launch Complex 6 (SLC-6) aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy.

In 2021, SpaceX reportedly won a $1.8 billion contract from the NRO to build a network of hundreds of spy satellites under its Starshield unit. The satellites reportedly will be able to &quot;track targets on the ground and share that data with U.S. intelligence and military officials... enabling the U.S. government to quickly capture continuous imagery of activities on the ground nearly anywhere on the globe.&quot;

==Organization==

The NRO is part of the Department of Defense. The Director of the NRO is appointed by the President of the United States, by and with the consent of the Senate. Traditionally, the position was given to either the Under Secretary of the Air Force or the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space, but with the appointment of Donald Kerr as Director of the NRO in July 2005 the position is now independent. The Agency is organized as follows:

Principal Deputy Director of the NRO (PDDNRO)
* Reports to and coordinates with the DNRO on all NRO activities and handles the daily management of the NRO with decision responsibility as delegated by the DNRO; and,
* In the absence of the Director, acts on behalf of the DNRO.

Deputy Director of the NRO (DDNRO) 
* Senior USAF General Officer. Represents the civilian/uniformed USAF personnel assigned to the NRO;
* Assists both the DNRO and PDDNRO in the daily direction of the NRO; and,
* Coordinates activities between the USAF and the NRO.

The Corporate Staff
* Encompasses all those support functions such as legal, diversity, human resources, security/counterintelligence, procurement, public affairs, etc. necessary for the day-to-day operation of the NRO and in support of the DNRO, PDNRO, and DDNRO.

===Personnel===
In 2007, the NRO described itself as &quot;a hybrid organization consisting of some 3,000 personnel and jointly staffed by members of the armed services, the Central Intelligence Agency and DOD civilian personnel.&quot; Between 2010 and 2012, the workforce is expected to increase by 100. The majority of workers for the NRO are private corporate contractors, with $7 billion of the agency&#x27;s $8 billion budget going to private corporations.

===Budget===

The NRO derives its funding both from the US intelligence budget and the military budget. In 1971, the annual budget was estimated to be around $1 billion in nominal dollars ($ billion real in ). A 1975 report by the Congressional Commission on the Organization of the Government for the Conduct of Foreign Policy states that the NRO had &quot;the largest budget of any intelligence agency&quot;. By 1994, the annual budget had risen to $6 billion (inflation adjusted $ billion in ), and for 2010 it is estimated to amount to $15 billion (inflation adjusted $ billion in ). This would correspond to 19% of the overall US intelligence budget of $80 billion for FY2010. For Fiscal Year 2012 the budget request for science and technology included an increase to almost 6% (about $600 million) of the NRO budget after it had dropped to just about 3% of the overall budget in the years before.

===NRO directives and instructions===
Under the Freedom of Information Act, the NRO declassified a list of secret directives for internal use. The following is a list of the released directives, which are available for download:

* NROD 10-2 – &quot;National Reconnaissance Office External Management Policy&quot;
* NROD 10-4 – &quot;National Reconnaissance Office Sensitive Activities Management Group&quot;

* NROD 121-1 – &quot;Training of NRO Personnel&quot;
* NROI 150-4 – &quot;Prohibited Items in NRO Headquarters Buildings/Property&quot;

===Coordination with USSPACECOM and USSF===
At a mid-2019 press event just prior to the establishment of USSPACECOM, then-Air Force General John W. Raymond (set to lead the new command) stated that the NRO will &quot;respond to the direction of the United States Space Command commander&quot; to &quot;protecting and defending those (space) capabilities&quot;. General Raymond further stated that &quot;we [NRO and USSPACECOM] have a shared concept of operations, we have a shared vision and a shared concept of operations. We train together, we exercise together, we man the same C2 center, if you will, at the National Space Defense Center.&quot;

In December 2019, the United States Space Force (USSF) was established, also helmed by Raymond, now a Space Force General and Chief of Space Operations (CSO). NRO continued its close relationship with American military space operations, partnering with the Space Force&#x27;s Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) to manage the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program, which uses government and contract spacecraft to launch important government payloads. NSSL supports both the USSF and NRO, as well as the Navy. NRO Director Scolese has characterized his agency as critical to American space dominance, stating that NRO provides &quot;unrivaled situational awareness and intelligence to the best imagery and signals data on the planet.&quot;

In August 2021, Scolese said he, Raymond, and Dickinson recently agreed to a Protect and Defend Strategic Framework covering national security in space and the relationship between DOD and the intelligence community on everything from acquisition to operations.

==Technology==

NRO&#x27;s technology is likely more advanced than its civilian equivalents. In the 1980s, the NRO had satellites and software that were capable of determining the exact dimensions of a tank gun. In 2012 the agency donated two space telescopes to NASA. Despite being stored unused, the instruments are superior to the Hubble Space Telescope. One journalist observed, &quot;If telescopes of this caliber are languishing on shelves, imagine what they&#x27;re actually &quot;using&quot;.&quot;

===NMIS network===
The NRO Management Information System (NMIS) is a computer network used to distribute NRO data classified as Top Secret. It is also known as the Government Wide Area Network (GWAN).

===Sentient AI satellite control system===

Sentient is an automated (artificial intelligence) intelligence analysis system under development by the National Reconnaissance Office. A principal purpose of the Sentient system is described by the NRO as &quot;compiling at machine, versus human speed, synthesis of complex distributed data sources for rapid analysis faster than humans can manage&quot;.

According to Robert Cardillo, a former director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the Sentient system is intended to use &quot;automated inferencing&quot; to aid intelligence collection. The Verge described Sentient as &quot;an omnivorous analysis tool, capable of devouring data of all sorts, making sense of the past and present, anticipating the future, and pointing satellites toward what it determines will be the most interesting parts of that future.&quot;

===Spacecraft===

The NRO maintains four main satellite constellations: 
* NRO SIGINT constellation

<doc id="377055" wikidata="Q1350326" url="?curid=377055" title="Frostbite">
<text>Frostbite is a skin injury that occurs when someone is exposed to extremely low temperatures, causing the freezing of the skin or other tissues, commonly affecting the fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin areas. Most often, frostbite occurs in the hands and feet. The initial symptoms are typically a feeling of cold and tingling or numbing. This may be followed by clumsiness with a white or bluish color to the skin. Swelling or blistering may occur following treatment. Complications may include hypothermia or compartment syndrome.
People who are exposed to low temperatures for prolonged periods, such as winter sports enthusiasts, military personnel, and homeless individuals, are at greatest risk. Other risk factors include drinking alcohol, smoking, mental health problems, certain medications, and prior injuries due to cold. The underlying mechanism involves injury from ice crystals and blood clots in small blood vessels following thawing. Diagnosis is based on symptoms. Severity may be divided into superficial (1st and 2nd degree) or deep (3rd and 4th degree). A bone scan or MRI may help in determining the extent of injury.
Prevention consists of wearing proper, fully-covering clothing, avoiding low temperatures and wind, maintaining hydration and nutrition, and sufficient physical activity to maintain core temperature without exhaustion. Treatment is by rewarming, by immersion in warm water (near body temperature) or by body contact, and should be done only when consistent temperature can be maintained so that refreezing is not a risk. Rapid heating or cooling should be avoided since it could potentially cause burning or heart stress. Rubbing or applying force to the affected areas should be avoided as it may cause further damage such as abrasions. The use of ibuprofen and tetanus toxoid is recommended for pain relief or to reduce swelling or inflammation. For severe injuries, iloprost or thrombolytics may be used. Surgery, including amputation, is sometimes necessary.
Evidence of frostbite occurring in people dates back 5,000 years. Evidence was documented in a pre-Columbian mummy discovered in the Andes. The number of cases of frostbite is unknown. Rates may be as high as 40% a year among those who mountaineer. The most common age group affected is those 30 to 50 years old. Frostbite has also played an important role in a number of military conflicts. The first formal description of the condition was in 1813 by Dominique Jean Larrey, a physician in Napoleon&#x27;s army, during its invasion of Russia.

==Signs and symptoms==

Areas that are usually affected include cheeks, ears, nose and fingers and toes. Frostbite is often preceded by frostnip. The symptoms of frostbite progress with prolonged exposure to cold. Historically, frostbite has been classified by degrees according to skin and sensation changes, similar to burn classifications. However, the degrees do not correspond to the amount of long term damage. A simplification of this system of classification is superficial (first or second degree) or deep injury (third or fourth degree).

===First degree===
* First degree frostbite is superficial, surface skin damage that is usually not permanent.
* Early on, the primary symptom is loss of feeling in the skin. In the affected areas, the skin is numb, and possibly swollen, with a reddened border. 
* In the weeks after injury, the skin&#x27;s surface may slough off.
===Second degree===
* In second degree frostbite, the skin develops clear blisters early on, and the skin&#x27;s surface hardens.
* In the weeks after injury, this hardened, blistered skin dries, blackens, and peels.
* At this stage, lasting cold sensitivity and numbness can develop.
===Third degree===
* In third degree frostbite, the layers of tissue below the skin freeze.
* Symptoms include blood blisters and &quot;blue-grey discoloration of the skin&quot;.
* In the weeks after injury, pain persists and a blackened crust (eschar) develops.
* There can be longterm ulceration and damage to growth plates.

=== Fourth degree ===

* In fourth degree frostbite, structures below the skin are involved like muscles, tendon, and bone.
* Early symptoms include a colorless appearance of the skin, a hard texture, and painless rewarming.
* Later, the skin becomes black and mummified. The amount of permanent damage can take one month or more to determine. Autoamputation can occur after two months.

==Causes==
===Risk factors===
The major risk factor for frostbite is exposure to cold through geography, occupation and/or recreation. Inadequate clothing and shelter are major risk factors. Frostbite is more likely when the body&#x27;s ability to produce or retain heat is impaired. Physical, behavioral, and environmental factors can all contribute to the development of frostbite. Immobility and physical stress (such as malnutrition or dehydration) are also risk factors. Disorders and substances that impair circulation contribute, including diabetes, Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon, tobacco and alcohol use. Homeless individuals and individuals with some mental illnesses may be at higher risk.

==Mechanism==
===Freezing===

In frostbite, cooling of the body causes narrowing of the blood vessels (vasoconstriction). Prolonged exposure to temperatures below may cause ice crystals to form in the tissues, and prolonged exposure to temperatures below may cause ice crystals to form in the blood. Ice crystals can damage small blood vessels at the site of injury. Typically, prolonged exposure to temperatures below may cause frostbite.

===Rewarming===

Rewarming causes tissue damage through reperfusion injury, which involves vasodilation, swelling (edema), and poor blood flow (stasis). Platelet aggregation is another possible mechanism of injury. Blisters and spasm of blood vessels (vasospasm) can develop after rewarming.

===Non-freezing cold injury===

The process of frostbite differs from the process of Non-freezing cold injury (NFCI). In NFCI, temperature in the tissue decreases gradually. This slower temperature decrease allows the body to try to compensate through alternating cycles of closing and opening blood vessels (vasoconstriction and vasodilation). If this process continues, inflammatory mast cells act in the area. Small clots (microthrombi) form and can cut off blood to the affected area (known as ischemia) and damage nerve fibers. Rewarming causes a series of inflammatory chemicals such as prostaglandins to increase localized clotting.

===Pathophysiology===
The pathological mechanism by which frostbite causes body tissue injury can be characterized by four stages: Prefreeze, freeze-thaw, vascular stasis, and the late ischemic stage.

# Prefreeze phase: involves the cooling of tissues without ice crystal formation.
# Freeze-thaw phase: ice-crystals form, resulting in cellular damage and death.
# Vascular stasis phase: marked by blood coagulation or the leaking of blood out of the vessels.
# Late ischemic phase: characterized by inflammatory events, ischemia and tissue death.

== Diagnosis ==
Frostbite is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms as described above, and by patient history. Other conditions that can have a similar appearance or occur at the same time include:
* Frostnip is similar to frostbite, but without ice crystal formation in the skin. Whitening of the skin and numbness reverse quickly after rewarming. 
* Trench foot is damage to nerves and blood vessels that results from exposure to cold wet (non-freezing) conditions. This is reversible if treated early. 
* Pernio or chilblains are inflammation of the skin from exposure to wet, cold (non-freezing) conditions. They can appear as various types of ulcers and blisters.
* Bullous pemphigoid is a condition that causes itchy blisters over the body that can mimic frostbite. It does not require exposure to cold to develop. 
* Levamisole toxicity is a vasculitis that can appear similar to frostbite. It is caused by contamination of cocaine by levamisole. Skin lesions can look similar those of frostbite, but do not require cold exposure to occur.

People who have hypothermia often have frostbite as well. Since hypothermia is life-threatening this should be treated first. Technetium-99 or MR scans are not required for diagnosis, but might be useful for prognostic purposes.

== Prevention ==

The Wilderness Medical Society recommends covering the skin and scalp, taking in adequate nutrition, avoiding constrictive footwear and clothing, and remaining active without causing exhaustion. Supplemental oxygen might also be of use at high elevations. Repeated exposure to cold water makes people more susceptible to frostbite. Additional measures to prevent frostbite include:
* Avoiding temperatures below −23 °C (-9 °F)
* Avoiding moisture, including in the form of sweat and/or skin emollients
* Avoiding alcohol and drugs that impair circulation or natural protective responses
* Layering clothing
* Using chemical or electric warming devices
* Recognizing early signs of frostnip and frostbite

==Treatment==

Individuals with frostbite or potential frostbite should go to a protected environment and get warm fluids. If there is no risk of re-freezing, the extremity can be exposed and warmed in the underarm of a companion or the groin. If the area is allowed to refreeze, there can be worse tissue damage. If the area cannot be reliably kept warm, the person should be brought to a medical facility without rewarming the area. Rubbing the affected area can also increase tissue damage. Aspirin and ibuprofen can be given in the field to prevent clotting and inflammation. Ibuprofen is often preferred to aspirin because aspirin may block a subset of prostaglandins that are important in injury repair.

The first priority in people with frostbite should be to assess for hypothermia and other life-threatening complications of cold exposure. Before treating frostbite, the core temperature should be raised above 35 °C. Oral or intravenous (IV) fluids should be given.

Other considerations for standard hospital management include:
* wound care: blisters can be drained by needle aspiration, unless they are bloody (hemorrhagic). Aloe vera gel can be applied before breathable, protective dressings or bandages are put on. 
* antibiotics: if there is trauma, skin infection (cellulitis) or severe injury
* tetanus toxoid: should be administered according to local guidelines. Uncomplicated frostbite wounds are not known to encourage tetanus. 
* pain control: NSAIDs or opioids are recommended during the painful rewarming process.

=== Rewarming ===
If the area is still partially or fully frozen, it should be rewarmed in the hospital with a warm bath with povidone iodine or chlorhexidine antiseptic. Active rewarming seeks to warm the injured tissue as quickly as possible without burning. The faster tissue is thawed, the less tissue damage occurs. According to Handford and colleagues, &quot;The Wilderness Medical Society and State of Alaska Cold Injury Guidelines recommend a temperature of 37–39 °C, which decreases the pain experienced by the patient whilst only slightly slowing rewarming time.&quot; Warming takes 15 minutes to 1 hour. The faucet should be left running so the water can circulate. Rewarming can be very painful, so pain management is important.

=== Medications ===
People with potential for large amputations and who present within 24 hours of injury can be given TPA with heparin. These medications should be withheld if there are any contraindications. Bone scans or CT angiography can be done to assess damage.

Blood vessel dilating medications such as iloprost may prevent blood vessel blockage. This treatment might be appropriate in grades 2–4 frostbite, when people get treatment within 48 hours. In addition to vasodilators, sympatholytic drugs can be used to counteract the detrimental peripheral vasoconstriction that occurs during frostbite.

A systematic review and metaanalysis revealed that iloprost alone or iloprost plus recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) may decrease amputation rate in case of severe frostbite in comparison to buflomedil alone with no major adverse events reported from iloprost or iloprost plus rtPA in the included studies.

===Surgery===

Various types of surgery might be indicated in frostbite injury, depending on the type and extent of damage. Debridement or amputation of necrotic tissue is usually delayed unless there is gangrene or systemic infection (sepsis). This has led to the adage &quot;Frozen in January, amputate in July&quot;. If symptoms of compartment syndrome develop, fasciotomy can be done to attempt to preserve blood flow.

== Prognosis ==

Tissue loss and autoamputation are potential consequences of frostbite. Permanent nerve damage including loss of feeling can occur. It can take several weeks to know what parts of the tissue will survive. Time of exposure to cold is more predictive of lasting injury than temperature the individual was exposed to. The classification system of grades, based on the tissue response to initial rewarming and other factors is designed to predict degree of longterm recovery.

=== Grades ===
Grade 1: if there is no initial lesion on the area, no amputation or lasting effects are expected

Grade 2: if there is a lesion on the distal body part, tissue and fingernails can be destroyed

Grade 3: if there is a lesion on the intermediate or near body part, auto-amputation and loss of function can occur

Grade 4: if there is a lesion very near the body (such as the carpals of the hand), the limb can be lost. Sepsis and/or other systemic problems are expected.

A number of long term sequelae can occur after frostbite. These include transient or permanent changes in sensation, paresthesia, increased sweating, cancers, and bone destruction/arthritis in the area affected.

== Epidemiology ==
There is a lack of comprehensive statistics about the epidemiology of frostbite. In the United States, frostbite is more common in northern states. In Finland, annual incidence was 2.5 per 100,000 among civilians, compared with 3.2 per 100,000 in Montreal. Research suggests that men aged 30–49 are at highest risk, possibly due to occupational or recreational exposures to cold.

== History ==
Frostbite has been described in military history for millennia. The Greeks encountered and discussed the problem of frostbite as early as 400 BC. Researchers have found evidence of frostbite in humans dating back 5,000 years, in an Andean mummy. Napoleon&#x27;s Army was the first documented instance of mass cold injury in the early 1800s. According to Zafren, nearly 1 million combatants fell victim to frostbite in the First and Second World Wars, and the Korean War.

== Society and culture ==

Several notable cases of frostbite include:

* Captain Lawrence Oates, an English army captain and Antarctic explorer who in 1912 died of complications of frostbite 
* Harold Bride, the junior wireless operator of , who suffered severe frostbite on his feet as he and other survivors stood for over an hour on the back of a capsized lifeboat knee-deep in freezing water—Bride had to be carried off from the rescue vessel after it arrived in New York
* Noted American rock climber Hugh Herr, who in 1982 lost both legs below the knee to frostbite after being stranded on Mount Washington (New Hampshire) in a blizzard 
* Beck Weathers, a survivor of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster who lost his nose and hands to frostbite 
* Scottish mountaineer Jamie Andrew, who in 1999 had all four limbs amputated due to sepsis from frostbite sustained after becoming trapped for four nights whilst climbing Les Droites in the Mont Blanc massif
==Research directions==
Evidence is insufficient to determine whether or not hyperbaric oxygen therapy as an adjunctive treatment can assist in tissue salvage. Cases have been reported, but no randomized control trial has been performed on humans.

Medical sympathectomy using intravenous reserpine has also been attempted with limited success. Studies have suggested that administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPa) either intravenously or intra-arterially may decrease the likelihood of eventual need for amputation.

<text>Eugene &quot;Gene&quot; Bilbrew (June 29, 1923 – May 1974) was an American vocal group singer, cartoonist, and &quot;bizarre art&quot; pioneer. As noted in the biography, &quot;GENE BILBREW REVEALED: The Unsung Legacy of a Fetish Art Pioneer&quot;, he was &quot;the first black career fetish artist in history.&quot; Starting in the mid-1950s, he was among the most prolific illustrators of fetish-oriented pulp book covers. In addition to signing his work under his own name, he produced art under a range of pseudonyms, including ENEG (&quot;Gene&quot; spelled backwards), Van Rod, and Bondy.

==Early life==

Born in Los Angeles in 1923, Bilbrew&#x27;s first career was as a vocal group singer, performing with The Mellow Tones and the Basin Street Boys. 

Pérez Seves debunked the myth that Bilbrew illustrated or produced the comic strip series named &quot;The Bronze Bomber&quot; for the African-American newspaper, &quot;Los Angeles Sentinel&quot;. In truth, Bilbrew&#x27;s friend William Alexander produced the strip for the &quot;Los Angeles Tribune&quot;. One printed page, showing the Bomber cartoon from March 8, 1943, was repurposed by artist Mildred Howard as the base layer of her collage &quot;Millenials &amp; XYZ #IV&quot; (2014), which is in the permanent collection of the Jordan Schnitzer Family Foundation. Four of the six panels are partly or wholly obscured by other elements of the collage. The upper three panels show the source and style. The &quot;Tribune&quot; began publication in 1941, but the earliest microfilm copies begin in September 1943, and the Bomber does not appear there. By early 1944, Alexander was in the Army. During 1941–1944, March 8 was a Monday only in 1943. Bilbrew was then 18 years old.

According to Pérez Seves, later that year, at age 19, Bilbrew would evade the draft due to psychiatric reasons and become a founding member of his first vocal group, The Mellow Tones.

==Career==

Starting in 1950, Bilbrew switched from singing to illustrative art. His first professional art job was for the hugely influential comics artist Will Eisner on &quot;The Spirit&quot;, where Bilbrew took over the back-up series &quot;Clifford&quot;—a humor page for small children—after its originator Jules Feiffer was drafted into the army. Bilbrew&#x27;s &quot;Clifford&quot; was syndicated as a weekly comic strip by General Features from 1951 to 1952. 

The start of Bilbrew&#x27;s &quot;bizarre art&quot; career came in 1951 through underground artist and pioneer Eric Stanton, whom Bilbrew met while attending Cartoonists and Illustrators School. From then on, Bilbrew focused on fetish art, producing work for notable underground publishers Irving Klaw, Edward Mishkin, Stanley Malkin, and the Sturman brothers. He also notably produced many illustrations and covers for Leonard Burtman, publisher of &quot;Exotique&quot;, a fetish magazine published between 1955 and 1959.

==Death==
While his career waned with the coming of relaxed censorship laws of the 1960s, his substance abuse worsened in the early 1970s. According to Eric Stanton, Gene Bilbrew died in the back of a Times Square adult bookstore in May 1974.

==Other==
In 2019, the National Leather Association International established an award named after Bilbrew for creators of animated erotic art.

<doc id="377060" wikidata="Q2639448" url="?curid=377060" title="Morgan's Canon">
<text>Morgan&#x27;s Canon, also known as Lloyd Morgan&#x27;s Canon, Morgan&#x27;s Canon of Interpretation or the principle or law of parsimony, is a fundamental precept of comparative (animal) psychology, coined by 19th-century British psychologist C. Lloyd Morgan. In its developed form it states that:
In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development.

Morgan&#x27;s explanation illustrates the supposed fallacy in anthropomorphic approaches to animal behaviour. He believed that people should only equate the actions of animals to human states, such as emotions, intents, or conscious awareness, if a less advanced description of the behaviour cannot be posed. Alternatively, animal behaviours can be justified as complex when the animal&#x27;s initiative involves procedures beyond instinctual practice (i.e. the animal is consciously aware of their own natural behaviours). This explanation can be used to understand the context under which the canon was studied, as well as its praises and criticisms. Several real world applications involving mating, competition and cognition exemplify Morgan&#x27;s preference to simplify animal behaviour as it relates to these processes.

==Context==
Morgan&#x27;s canon was derived after questioning previous interpretations of animal behaviour, specifically the anecdotal approach of George Romanes that he deemed excessively anthropomorphic. Its prestige is partly credited to Morgan&#x27;s behavioural descriptions, where those initially interpreted as using higher mental processes could be better explained by simple trial-and-error learning (what is now called operant conditioning). One famous observation involves Morgan&#x27;s terrier Tony, who, after many attempts, had successfully opened a garden gate. Though the final result could easily be seen as an insightful act, Lloyd Morgan had watched and recorded the approximations leading to the dog&#x27;s gradual procedural learning, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.

==Evaluation==

The widespread study of animal cognition has required a disciplined use of Lloyd Morgan&#x27;s canon. D.A. Dewsbury called Morgan&#x27;s Canon &quot;perhaps, the most quoted statement in the history of comparative psychology&quot;. Frans de Waal reiterated that it is &quot;perhaps the most quoted statement in all of psychology&quot; in his book &quot;The Ape and the Sushi Master.&quot; One section points to a statement that Morgan later added: &quot;there is nothing really wrong with complex interpretations if an animal species has provided independent signs of high intelligence&quot;. It has played a critical role in the growth of the prestige of behaviourism in twentieth century academic psychology. Morgan’s contribution remains a significant framework of animal cognition and is revered as a valued understanding of behavioural execution. Various reasons for adherence to the canon have been offered, including fitness analysis, constraints of evolution and phylogeny, and physiological limitations.

With that being said, the canon has gathered substantial criticism. Many modern researchers such as Tobias Starzak suggest that it lacks operationally defined behaviour hierarchies. There is additional concern that the restriction of advanced cognitive explanations dismisses the spectrum of behavioural awareness and opportunity. Due to these problems, Morgan&#x27;s own interpretation is thought to be oversimplified and ambiguous. Some animal behaviour research poses questions about favouring simplistic reasonings, especially when discussing behaviours from dispersed origins or observing rather sophisticated systems. The quantity of proposed behavioural mechanisms appears to receive less attention than their position on a cognitive scale. Several studies have taken note of this and thus maintained skepticism of Morgan&#x27;s Canon as a principle. Despite these shortcomings, several submitted alternatives, including evidentialism, aim to resolve its complications.

==Applications in animal populations==

=== Mating displays ===

Most varieties of animals produce displays for reproductive or courtship purposes. Mating behaviour is often thought to be intentional due to the discriminatory nature of mate selection; that is, pursuit of potential partners anticipates a deliberate choice. Mating processes are frequently disputed under the nature-nurture debate. However, mating procedures may vary across circumstances. Homosexual mating displays such as those noticed in an observation of king penguins on the Kerguelen Islands appear identical to those used to attract opposite sex individuals. The ability of penguins to differentiate between members of the same and opposite sex has been debated within animal behaviour literature, some claiming the phenomenon to be irregular while others considered it more systemic. Nonetheless, environmental conditions such as sex ratios may demonstrate individual differences within the population. As the Kerguelen Island population showed no conscious discernment between individuals, instead choosing mates at random, Morgan&#x27;s canon possibly presumes that their displays are genetically hardwired and show no evidence of discrimination between sexes.

=== Competition and external signals ===
Competition among organisms (usually males) results from unwavering disputes over territory (for mating or general residence), food, or potential mating partners. Individuals may compete using visual signals, as is seen in various butterfly species. Two different combative signals have been recorded: one uses an aerodynamic display that results in surrender of at least one male contestant, the second requires an encounter with an immature cocoon. The latter does not exclude rivals from approaching the same cocoon, but fights can occur in the event that a female is hatched. Similar instances in other species are supported by game theory principles. However, competition between butterflies is a rare occurrence and therefore conflict settlement is not exactly understood. One study used Morgan&#x27;s canon to identify a third process; the possibility that battles emerge from a mistaken attempt to court other competitors. Since butterflies cannot cause severe injury to opponents nor accurately identify another&#x27;s sex, the distinction of a mate from a competitor is sometimes nonexistent. Results of several studies conclude that air combat is ideally exclusive to territorial males. Likewise, Morgan&#x27;s canon justifies misguided combat as long as recorded instances of sex differentiation are limited.
=== Cognitive awareness ===
The scope of animal consciousness is not perceived equally by human standards, so obligations to animal species as a whole are unequally distributed. Concerns raised by animal rights activists partly discuss the cognitive abilities of individuals or entire species. Such issues suggest that most species are at least somewhat capable of self-acknowledgement. Dolphins are particularly regarded for bearing high intellectual capacities, and are often the subject of cognitive experiments. Though Morgan&#x27;s canon usually intends to avoid assumptions based on higher order processes, psychological exceptions arise with dolphins as their perceptions do not imply intentionality on their behalf. There is evidence of both self-directed and otherwise directed states of awareness that are close to those experienced by humans. A 2004 study tested the perceptual concept of uncertainty in dolphins. Subject were acclimated to an unaltered sound clip, then were expected to use their memory to determine a change in pitch. Once a lower or higher pitch was heard, the dolphins touched an oar intended as an indicator of each pitch category. Results reference a discrimination threshold beyond which interpretations of pitch change become doubtful (about 2100 Hz). Given potential errors in distinction, a third &quot;escape&quot; oar was provided for use in the event of uncertainty. While individuals do make use of the &quot;escape&quot;, they are often reluctant to do so. Dolphin subjects still chose one of the other two options despite confusion, perhaps as an insistence on their original answer. Based on this type of research, experts have widely agreed on a pattern of ingrained compulsion that further supports Morgan&#x27;s lower ordered inquiries.

<doc id="377064" wikidata="Q1810225" url="?curid=377064" title="Buick Skylark">
<text>The Buick Skylark is a passenger car formerly produced by Buick. The model was made in six production runs, during 46 years, over which the car&#x27;s design varied dramatically due to changing technology, tastes, and new standards implemented over the years. It was named for the species of bird called &quot;skylark&quot;.

The Skylark name first appeared on a limited production luxury convertible using the Buick Roadmaster&#x27;s chassis for two years, then was reintroduced in 1961 as a higher luxury content alternative to the entry-level Buick Special on which the Skylark was based upon. It was then positioned as Buick&#x27;s luxury performance model when the Buick GSX was offered. As GM began downsizing during the late 1970s, the Skylark became the entry-level model when the Special nameplate was used as a trim package designation, then in the 1980s was offered as a front-wheel-drive vehicle where it was both a coupe and sedan for three different generations.

==1953–1954==
Created to mark Buick&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the Roadmaster Skylark joined the Oldsmobile 98 Fiesta and Cadillac Series 62 Eldorado as top-of-the-line, limited-production specialty convertibles introduced in 1953 by General Motors to promote its design leadership. Of the three, the Skylark&#x27;s run of 1,690 units proved the most successful, and an amazing sales feat considering the car&#x27;s 1953 list price of slightly in excess of US$5,000 ($ in dollars ) was over 50% more than the well-equipped US$3,200 Roadmaster convertible on which it was based ($ in dollars ). It was comparable in price to the 1953 Packard Caribbean with a similar retail price.

Production ran for two years. Based on the model 76R two-door Roadmaster convertible, the 1953 Skylark (designated model 76X) had identical dimensions (except height), almost identical appearance, shared its drive train, and had all its standard equipment, plus its few remaining options, including power windows, power brakes, full carpeting, and a &quot;Selectronic&quot; AM radio. Only air conditioning was not offered, unnecessary in either convertible.

Importantly, the new Skylark featured Buick&#x27;s new 322 in3 (5.3 L) Fireball V8 in place of the automaker&#x27;s longstanding straight 8, and a 12-volt electrical system, both division firsts. It debuted full-cutout wheel openings, a styling cue that spread to the main 1954 Buick line. Accenting its lowered, notched beltline was a new &quot;Sweepspear&quot; running almost the entire length of the vehicle, a styling cue that was to appear in various forms on many Buick models over the years.

The 1953 Skylark was handmade in many respects. Only stampings for the hood, trunk lid, and a portion of the convertible tub were shared with the Roadmaster and Super convertibles. All Skylark tubs were finished with various amounts of lead filler. The inner doors were made by cutting the 2-door Roadmaster&#x27;s in two then welding the pieces back together at an angle to produce the rakish door dip. An overall more streamlined look was reinforced by cutting the windshield almost shorter and lowering the side windows and convertible top frame proportionately. Seat frames and steering column were then dropped to provide proper headroom and driving position. Front legroom was . Authentic wire wheels were produced by Kelsey-Hayes, chromed everywhere except the plated and painted &quot;Skylark&quot; center emblem.

The Skylark returned in 1954 with radically restyled styling unique to the Buick line, which included wheel cutouts that could be painted in a contrasting color to the body&#x27;s. The trunk was sloped into a semi-barrel, and tail lights moved to large chromed fins projecting atop the rear fenders.

Re-designated model 100, the car was based on the all-new shorter Century/Special series 40 chassis and not the larger series 60 Roadmaster/Super chassis, also all-new for 1954. Once again, all Skylarks were built as 2-door convertibles and carried the same luxury equipment as before, but front leg room dropped . While smaller and lighter, the Skylark received a performance boost by retaining the big Buicks&#x27; powertrain, an evolutionary improvement of 1953&#x27;s with the highest output in the division&#x27;s lineup.

The 1954 Skylark once again had unique sheet metal stampings for its elongated wheel cutouts and new semi-barrel trunk, though fabrication was done without hand labor. The hood ornament was unique, adopted the following year across the Buick product line.

Sales proved to be poor, reflecting the Skylark&#x27;s continued high price of US$4,843 ($ in dollars ) coupled with a perceived step-down from the Roadmaster/Super series using the Century&#x27;s chassis, slumping far enough to cause the model&#x27;s cancellation at the end of the 1954 model year, with only 836 being manufactured.


==First generation (1961–1963)==

In the fall of 1960, General Motors introduced a trio of new compact cars for the 1961 model year that shared the same chassis, engines, and basic sheet metal: the Buick Special, Pontiac Tempest, and Oldsmobile F-85. The Special&#x27;s styling was strongly influenced by the new corporate look shared with the larger LeSabre, Invicta, and Electra also introduced in 1961.

In the middle of the 1961 model year the Buick Special Skylark made its debut. Effectively a luxury trim level, it was based on a two-door sedan (also referred to as a coupe), it featured unique Skylark emblems, taillight housings, lower-body side moldings, turbine wheel covers, and a vinyl-covered roof. 1961 Skylarks featured three Ventiports on each fender. A plush &quot;Cordaveen&quot; all-vinyl interior was standard, with bucket seats available as an option. Instrumentation was minimal, consisting of only a speedometer and fuel gauge.

The Skylark replaced the Special&#x27;s standard aluminum block two-barrel carburetor V8 with a higher compression ratio four-barrel version that boosted power from at 4600 rpm to .

For the 1962 model year, the Skylark became a model in its own right. It used the previous year&#x27;s basic sheet metal but was available in two new body styles: a two-door convertible coupe (shared with the Special and Special Deluxe models) and a two-door (pillarless) hardtop unique to it. Tuning of the 215-cubic-inch V8 increased power to at 4800 rpm. In 1962, the Skylark Special was also the first American car to use a V6 engine in volume production; it earned &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s Car of the Year for 1962. This 198 cid Fireball V6 was engineered down from the 215 and used many of the same design parameters, but was cast in iron. Output was 135 hp (gross) at 4600 rpm and at 2400 rpm. In their test that year, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; was impressed with Buick&#x27;s &quot;practical&quot; new V6, saying it &quot;sounds and performs exactly like the aluminum V8 in most respects.&quot;

In 1963, the Special&#x27;s body was restyled and minor changes made to the interior, particularly to the dash and instrument cluster. The 1963 Special was available as a two-door pillared hardtop coupe, a four dour sedan, a convertible, and a station wagon. Engine choices were a standard V6 with a twin-barrel carburetor and an optional V8 with (two-barrel) or more powerful four-barrel ( in 1962, in 1963). Transmission choices were a &#x27;three on the tree&#x27; manual transmission, a floor shift Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed manual, or a two-speed Turbine Drive automatic. The two speed &quot;Dual Path Turbine Drive&quot; automatic was a Buick design and shared no common parts with the better known Chevrolet Power-Glide transmission.

Two prototypes were made for 1962, each with a unique body. One a convertible and the other a hardtop. The prototypes came directly from Buick Engineering, both had been given two 4-barrel carburetors by the engineers thus increasing the prototype&#x27;s horsepower a little more than 80 hp. They had features from the &#x27;61, &#x27;62, and the &#x27;63 production models. Some features, such as the two 4-barrel carburetors, were left out of the production-line Skylarks. The prototypes were also longer, and wider than the production models. Of the two prototypes, only the hardtop still exists and resides with its owner in Michigan. It is possible the convertible prototype still exists in the Sloan Museum collection.

The 1963 Skylarks used the same chassis and wheelbase as the previous 1961 and 1962 models, but adopted new sheet metal that featured boxier styling. Length was increased by to , and the 215-cubic-inch V8 generated at 5,000 rpm. The 1963 Skylark was available as a two-door convertible coupe or a two-door (pillarless) hardtop coupe. The 1963 Special shared most sheet metal with the Skylark, but was available as a convertible, station wagon as well as two- and four-door sedans. Engine choices included a V6 with two-barrel carburetor, the V8 with two-barrel or a four-barrel carburetor. Transmission choices were a &quot;three on the tree&quot; manual transmission, a floor-shifted Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed manual, or a two-speed automatic. The two-speed &quot;Dual Path Turbine Drive&quot; automatic was a Buick design and shared no common parts with the Chevrolet Power-Glide transmission. Instrument panel padding and a cigarette lighter was standard.
==Second generation (1964–1967)==

Beginning with the 1964 model year, the Skylark trim level had enough sales to merit its own separate line. Along with the lower-priced Special from which it was derived, the model would move to a new wheelbase intermediate-size chassis shared with the Oldsmobile F-85, Pontiac Tempest, and new Chevrolet Chevelle. Both Buicks had a length of .

The standard 215-cubic-inch displacement, aluminum-block V8 engine was discontinued (and the associated tooling eventually sold to the British manufacturer Rover, who produced it as the Rover V8 engine until 2006).

In its place was a new all-cast-iron V6 with a Rochester 1-barrel carburetor that generated at 4400 rpm. It is an enlarged version of the prior V6 introduced for the 1962 model year. The basic V8 option was a 300-cubic-inch, with cast-iron block, aluminum heads, and a Rochester 2-barrel carburetor that generated at 4600 rpm. A high performance version was offered with 11:1 compression and a 4-barrel carburetor, generating . The V6 and V8 were of similar design and shared the same bore and stroke. A long-throw Hurst shifter was available for the four-speed manual transmission. For the 1965 model, cast-iron blocks and heads were used for all engines.

For the first time, a four-door sedan was offered in addition to the two-door convertible, two-door sedan, and hardtop coupe. Specials and Special Deluxes only came in pillared coupe versions. All Skylarks would have higher levels of exterior and interior trim than the Special and Special Deluxe from which they were derived. The sedan would come with cloth-and-vinyl seats standard, with an all-vinyl &quot;Cordaveen&quot; interior optional. All-vinyl bucket seats were standard on the convertible and optional on the hardtop coupe. The Skylark Coupe had a lower, more road-hugging profile than the other models. Buick&#x27;s traditional VentiPorts were integrated into the front half rub strip that ran the entire length of the vehicle, with later versions appearing vertically stacked as on the Buick Wildcat.

Inspired by the sales success of the Pontiac GTO, a Gran Sport option became available in mid-1965, offered as a coupe, hardtop or convertible. The Gran Sport featured Buick&#x27;s 401-cubic-inch &quot;Nailhead&quot; V8 with a Carter 4-barrel carburetor that produced at 4400 rpm, listed as 400 cubic inches in sales literature to elude a General Motors limit of 400 cubic inches in intermediate-sized cars. Unique Gran Sport badging, a heavy-duty radiator, and dual exhaust were also added.
In the 1966 model year, the pillared four-door sedan was replaced by a four-door hardtop. The 1966 two-door Skylark was available with the optional 340-cubic-inch &quot;Wildcat 375&quot;, engine which produced and torque with a 4-barrel Carter carb. The four-door sedan would rejoin the lineup for the 1967 model year, making a total of five Skylark body styles. The 225 V6 was standard on the two-door sedan, the 300-cubic-inch V8 on all other models, but the four-door hardtop sedan, which came with a 340-cubic-inch V8 engine using a Rochester 2-barrel carburetor and producing at 4400 rpm.

In 1967 Skylarks included the Federally-mandated safety equipment as other U.S. market passenger cars, including a dual-circuit hydraulic brake system, energy-absorbing steering column and wheel, 4-way hazard flashers, shoulder belt mounting points for outboard front passengers, softer interior surfaces, and recessed controls on the instrument panel.

The Gran Sport became the Gran Sport 400 to reflect the new, marginally smaller but more modern big-block engine and to set it apart from the new Gran Sport 340, a lower cost model using the 340-cubic-inch V8, available only as a two-door hardtop coupe.

==Third generation (1968–1972)==

The 1968 model year was one of significant change for the Buick Skylark. Although still using the same basic chassis, all of GM&#x27;s mid-sized cars adopted a policy of using two different length wheelbases. Two-door models used a shorter wheelbase of , while four-door models used a longer wheelbase of 116 in (the Buick Sport Wagon and Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser used an even longer wheelbase of 121 in). All of GM&#x27;s mid-sized cars received all-new sheet metal, incorporating a semi-fastback appearance, which was a revival of a streamlining on all GM products from 1942 until 1950 as demonstrated on the Buick Super Club Coupe (sedanette), that showed influences from the restyled Riviera. More Federally mandated safety features improved occupant protection and accident avoidance, including side marker lights, shoulder belts (on all models built after January 1, 1968), and parking lights that illuminated with headlights.

The Buick Gran Sport, previously an option package available on the Skylark, became a separate series, starting with the 340 hp/440 lbs torque 400 c.i.d. V8 1968 GS 400, using the 2-door Skylark body and chassis. In a reshuffling of models in the lineup, the Special Deluxe replaced the previous Special. The Skylark nameplate was shuffled down a notch to replace the previous Special Deluxe. The previous Skylark was replaced by a new Skylark Custom.

The basic Skylark was available as a two-door hardtop coupe or a four-door sedan. The Skylark Custom came as a two-door convertible coupe, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, or four-door sedan.


The previous V6 was discontinued and the associated tooling was sold to Kaiser Industries, which used the V6 in its Jeep trucks and sport utility vehicles. The base engine in Buick Skylarks (and Buick Special sedans) became a 250-cubic-inch Chevrolet I6, that produced at 4200 rpm using a single-barrel Rochester carburetor.

Optional on the Skylark and standard on the Skylark Custom was a new 350-cubic-inch V8 derived from the 340, using a two-barrel Rochester carburetor that produced at 4400 rpm. The Buick Special name was dropped after the 1969 model year. A locking steering column with a new, rectangular ignition key became standard on all 1969 GM cars (except Corvair), one year ahead of the Federal requirement.

For 1970, the mid-sized Buicks once again received new sheet metal and the Buick Skylark name was moved down another notch, replacing the previous entry-level Buick Special. It was available in two- and four-door sedans with the 250-cubic-inch inline-six as standard and the optional 350-cubic-inch V8 (260 horsepower at 4600 rpm). Two-door models shared their roofline with the 1970 Chevelle, distinct from that of the shared Pontiac LeMans and Oldsmobile Cutlass. The two-door sedan was unique to Buick, sharing its roofline as the hardtop but having a thick &quot;B&quot; pillar, with Buick&#x27;s traditional &quot;Sweepspear&quot; feature appearing as a crease running the length of the vehicle. Chevrolet did not offer a pillared coupe for the Chevelle from 1970 to 1972; all two-doors were hardtops.

Replacing the previous Buick Skylark was the Buick Skylark 350, available as a two-door hardtop coupe or four-door sedan with the 350-cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment. This 350-cubic-inch engine was a different design than the Chevy&#x27;s 350 CID engine (4.000 in × 3.48 in) the Buick design had a longer stroke and smaller bore (3.80 X 3.85 in) allowing for lower-end torque, deep-skirt block construction, higher nickel-content cast iron, crank main journals, and connecting rods, the distributor was located in front of the engine (typical of Buick), the oil pump was external and mounted in the front of the engine, the rocker arm assembly had all rocker arms mounted on a single rod and were not adjustable. The Skylark Custom continued to be available, also using the 350-cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment and still available as a two-door convertible coupe, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, and four-door sedan. Buick Gran Sport models continued to be available as a separate series. The Buick Sport Wagon name was now used on a conventional four-door station wagon that no longer featured a raised roof with glass panels over the cargo area, or a longer wheelbase, as in the past. It now used the same wheelbase as the Buick Skylark four-door sedan and the now-discontinued Buick Special four-door Station Wagon. It became, in effect, a Buick Skylark four-door station wagon in all respects but the name.

For the 1971 model year, the base Skylark was available only with the inline-6, now only putting out due to emission control devices, but in a two-door hardtop coupe body-style (in addition to the previous two- and four-door sedans). The Skylark 350 had a V8 engine that put out only . It was now available as a two-door sedan in addition to the previous two-door hardtop coupe and four-door sedan.
1972 was the last model year for the mid-sized Buick Skylark. During this model year many pollution controls were added to the engines, Compression was lowered, engines had to accept leaded and unleaded gas, and spark timing was retarded (no vacuum advance in lower gears) while driving in lower gears to reduce emissions. For 1972, the base Buick Skylark used the 350-cubic-inch V8 with the 2-barrel Rochester carburetor (now putting out 145 horsepower) as standard equipment. A new federally mandated system to calculate power was put into effect that year, and the actual engine performance was probably comparable but slightly lower because of pollution controls in the 1972 model year to the that was listed for the previous year. The Skylark 350 now used a version of the same V8 engine as the base Skylark, but with a 4-barrel Rochester carburetor that generated .

Skylark Customs were available with the same 350-cubic-inch V8 engines available in the basic Skylark and the Skylark 350. The Custom had an upgraded interior and dash with some extra chrome. Convertibles only came in the Skylark Customs and the Skylark 350s.

==(1973–1974) Skylark Hiatus==
For 1973, GM redesigned the A-body platform, but Buick dropped the Skylark nameplate and revived one of its old ones for their mid-size: the &quot;Century&quot;. The Century Estate replaced the Buick Sport Wagon. The Century inherited the Gran Sport performance option, but the Gran Sport name was once again reduced to being an option package.

==Fourth generation (1975–1979)==
When GM&#x27;s compact X-body platform was extensively restyled for the 1975 model year, Buick retained the Apollo name for their four-door sedan, while their two-doors (hatchback and sedan) were both rechristened &quot;Skylark&quot;.


Both the Apollo and the Skylark were available in Base and S/R versions; the S/R (Sports/Rallye) being European-inspired and more upscale. The Skylark sedan was also available as a very plain, lower-priced Skylark &quot;S&quot; with minimal interior and exterior trim.

Gone since 1968, the &quot;VentiPorts&quot; design element reappeared, integrated into the front half of the rub strip that ran the length of the vehicle.

The standard engine for the Buick Skylarks was Buick&#x27;s own 231-cubic-inch (3.8 L) V6 engine with a 2-barrel carburetor creating at 4000 rpm. Buick purchased back the tooling for the engine from American Motors, which acquired them when the company purchased the Kaiser Jeep division from Kaiser Industries. The Apollo used Chevrolet&#x27;s 250-cubic-inch (4.1 L) inline 6-cylinder engine.
Optional engines included the Oldsmobile 260-cubic-inch (4.3 L) V8 with a two-barrel carburetor producing at 4,000 rpm, and the Buick 350-cubic-inch (5.7 L) V8 with either a 2- or 4-barrel carburetor. In 1976, the 5.7 L V8 engines produced at 3,200 rpm with the 2-barrel carburetor, and at 3,400 rpm with the 4-barrel carburetor.

Beginning with the 1976 model year, the four-door sedans used the Skylark and Skylark S/R names instead of the previous Apollo badge, and came with the 3.8 L V6 engine as standard.
The 260-cubic-inch (4.3 L) V8 was discontinued after the 1976 model year. For the 1977 model year, it was replaced by a pair of V8 engines. The grille was also modified lightly for 1977, without the horizontal division and with a somewhat heavier appearance.

To commemorate the Bicentennial of the United States, the standard colors available on all Buicks were Judicial Black, Liberty White, Pewter Gray, Potomac Blue, Continental Blue, Concord Green, Constitution Green, Mount Vernon Cream, Buckskin Tan, Musket Brown, Boston Red and Independence Red, with specially available colors on select models Congressional Cream, Revere Red, Colonial Yellow and Firecracker Orange.

Available as an option in 1977 was a 301-cubic-inch (4.9 L) V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor, which produced at 4000 rpm (supplied by Pontiac). Also available was a 305-cubic-inch (5.0 L) V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor, which produced at 3800 rpm (supplied by Chevrolet). The Buick-built 5.7 L V8 was still available, but only with the 4-barrel carburetor.

Beginning with the 1978 model year, Chevrolet&#x27;s 5.7 L (350-cubic-inch) V8 with a four-barrel carburetor, which produced at 3,800 rpm, also was available. Also in that year, the Skylark Custom replaced the Skylark S/R as the most luxurious variant. The 1978s also received some very light cosmetic changes to the corner lights and grille.

The 1979 model year saw the discontinuance of the Skylark Custom two-door hatchback coupe (the base V6 produced more than 1978&#x27;s version). The 1979 model year was short because, midway through it, the all-new 1980 models were introduced early.

===Buick Skylarks in Iran===

Buick Skylarks were assembled in Iran (four-door sedans only) from 1977 to 1981 and again from 1986 to 1988 under the brand name of &quot;Buick Iran&quot;. The first generations were known as B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, from 1977 until 1981, and the second and last generation was known as the B2 and B3 from 1986 until 1988. The later models were made after GM released the kits and parts to Iran following the GM&#x27;s debt to Iran General Motors. These cars were equipped with a 5.7L engine (small block 350 Chevrolet, L engine, 4 barrel carburettor), and were fully equipped (power door locks, power window, power steering, automatic transmission, a/c, vinyl top). The Cadillac Seville and Chevrolet Nova were manufactured in Iran during the same period. A total of 40,000 GM cars were produced between 1977 and 1987 in Iran. These models were basically the same as those built in the U.S. from 1975 to 1979 (Islamic Revolution).

GM Iran changed its name to Pars Khodro (meaning &quot;Pars Automobile&quot; in Iranian, &quot;Pars&quot; being the ancient, original name of Persia) after 1979. The production continued from 1979 to 1987 on a part-time, occasional basis. 

GM ceased the production of all vehicles in Iran in 1987.

==Fifth generation (1980–1985)==
The 1980–1985 Skylark was Buick&#x27;s badge engineered version of GM&#x27;s new X-body architecture, shared with the Chevrolet Citation, Pontiac Phoenix, and Oldsmobile Omega and would bear some resemblance to the larger G-body mid-size cars. GM&#x27;s X-body would also become the basis for GM&#x27;s A-body mid-size cars that would be introduced as 1982 models. The new Skylark was introduced in the spring of 1979 as an early 1980 model featuring front-wheel drive, MacPherson strut front suspension and transversely mounted engine, items that had never appeared on Buick products. The new optional 60 degree 2.8 L V6 engine was developed specifically for the X-cars. This platform became the basis for nearly all following GM front-wheel drive vehicles, but like the other X-body cars was noted for numerous reports of a tendency to lock the rear wheels upon emergency braking, potentially causing the driver to lose control and crash (1980 models only). It was the first post-World War II Buick to offer a four-cylinder engine since the Buick Four was discontinued in 1918. 
The Skylark was available in two- or four-door sedan bodystyles, and in base, Sport, or Limited trims. The standard 2.5 L Iron Duke 4 used a 2-barrel Rochester carburetor and produced at 4000 rpm. The optional 2.8 L V6 also used a 2-barrel Rochester carburetor and produced at 4800 rpm. A four-speed manual overdrive transaxle was standard with a three-speed automatic transaxle as an option.
For the 1982 model year, the base 2.5 L engine received throttle body fuel injection (TBI). The optional 2.8 L V6 was joined by a more powerful high-output version that produced at 5400 rpm. Also for the 1982 model year, the Skylark received a mild facelift in the form of a new grille (the front parking lamps moved from outside the headlights to inside). In model year 1983, the base Skylark became the Skylark Custom. The Sport model was replaced by the T-Type, which was available only as a two-door coupe and came with the high-output version of the 2.8 L V6 engine as standard equipment.

In 1985, the last year of production, the X-body Skylark was available only as a four-door sedan in Custom or Limited trim, as the two-door coupe was replaced by Buick&#x27;s new Somerset Regal coupe, built on GM&#x27;s new N-body platform, shared with Pontiac&#x27;s revived Grand Am and the new Oldsmobile Calais. For 1985 the grille was again redesigned, as was the rear. The taillights were wider and the license plate was moved down to the bumper, while a &quot;Buick&quot; plate appeared where the license plate had been on previous model years.

==Sixth generation (1985–1991)==
For the 1985 model year, the two-door Skylark coupe was replaced by the Somerset Regal, built on the Oldsmobile-developed N-body platform. The &quot;Somerset&quot; name had previously been used as a trim package on the Regal. This generation of compact Buicks featured a more upscale and aerodynamic design than its predecessor, incorporating the long-hood/short-deck look popular at the time. The Pontiac-produced Iron Duke engine continued from the Skylark, but an Isuzu-sourced five-speed manual transmission replaced the four-speed as standard equipment. A new multi-port fuel-injected Buick V6, generating at 4900 rpm, replaced the Chevrolet-designed 2.8 L V6 and was paired only with a three-speed automatic transmission. The Somerset featured an all-digital instrument cluster.

For 1986, the Skylark sedan was shifted to the N platform and redesigned to match its coupe stablemate, which dropped the &quot;Regal&quot; suffix from its same. It remained available in either Custom or Limited trim levels, and gained the powertrain options from the Somerset but retained conventional analog gauges.

Beginning with the 1987 model year, the four-door Skylark was available as a sporty T-Type model installed with the 3.0 L LN7 V6 engine. In mid-model year, 1987 Skylark models had door-mounted automatic seat belts.
For 1988 models, the Somerset name was dropped and Buick&#x27;s two-door N-body compact would share the Skylark nameplate with its four-door counterparts. A new engine option for 1988 models was the fuel-injected, Oldsmobile-designed 2.3 L DOHC Quad-4 4-cylinder engine that produced at 5200 rpm. An S/E package for Custom models replaced the previous T-Type trim. On 1989 models, a fuel-injected 3.3 L V6 (160 hp at 5200 rpm) replaced the previous 3.0 L V6, which was also Buick-built. A new LE package become available on four-door sedans that featured a vinyl roof that covered part of the rear side windows. The three-speed automatic transaxle became standard for 1989. For 1990, a new base Skylark was added, moving the Custom model up to replace the Limited. The S/E package was replaced by a new Gran Sport two-door sedan, reviving a name that had not been connected with the Skylark for many years. The LE (&quot;Luxury Edition&quot;) sedan would become a full-fledged model.

The 1991 Skylark was a continuation of the 1990 lineup, with virtually no change made to the outward appearance of the car. There were minor mechanical changes made to the Skylark&#x27;s optional 3.3 L V6 power plant, including a one piece rear main bearing seal to replace the rope type previously used, and a redesigned camshaft flange.

==Seventh generation (1992–1998)==
Buick presented the Bolero concept in 1990, previewing numerous styling elements used in the 1992 Skylark, including its wedge-shape, chromed feature line rising along each body side and wrapping around the rear, along with a prominent pointed grille — reminiscent of 1930s Buick Special. The Skylark&#x27;s bodwork achieved a 0.319 coefficient of drag, compared to 0.374 for the previous version. The pointed grille had been used by Buick during the mid-1960s.
It was initially offered in two- and four-door body styles and in base and Gran Sport versions. The base engine was the 2.3 L Quad OHC, which produced at 5200 rpm. The optional 3.3 L V6 (standard on the GS) produced at 5200 rpm. All Skylarks came with the three-speed automatic transaxle.

For the 1993 model year, the base model was replaced by Custom and Limited trims. For 1994, a new 3.1 L V6 ( at 5200 rpm) replaced the previous 3.3 L V6 as standard on the GS and optional on the others. The Limited coupe was dropped for 1994, but returned for 1995.

Mechanical changes for the 1995 model year included the upgrading of the standard 2.3 L Quad 4 engine from a SOHC design to a DOHC design, increasing power to at 6000 rpm. The three-speed automatic transaxle continued to be standard with the base four-cylinder engine, but a new four-speed automatic (electronically controlled 4T60-E) was optional with the 4-cylinder engine and standard with the V6.

Skylark received a facelift for the 1996 model year in the form of a more conventional-looking grille. The previous 2.3 L I4 was replaced by a new 2.4 L DOHC I4 that produced at 6000 rpm. The previous three-speed automatic transaxle was discontinued and the four-speed automatic became standard on all Skylarks. An on-board diagnostic system (OBD II) was standard. Buick offered an &quot;Olympic Gold&quot; edition of the 1996 Skylark to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Olympic Games (also available on Regal). It featured gold USA/5-ring badging on the fenders, gold &quot;Skylark&quot; badges, gold-accented wheel covers, and gold accent trim.

There were only minor changes to the lineup for the 1997 model year, which was the last year that it would be available to the public in showrooms. A single-model 1998 Skylark sedan was produced for fleet-only sales, mostly to auto rental companies. Most of these 1998 models, the last year that Buick used the Skylark name, were eventually resold to the general public as used cars. After the Skylark&#x27;s discontinuation, Buick did not produce another compact car until 2012 Buick Verano.

Production ended on December 4, 1997.

The Skylark production line in Lansing was retooled to build the 2000–2003 Chevrolet Malibu.

<text>The British Islands is a term within the law of the United Kingdom which refers collectively to the following four polities:
* the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; 
* the Bailiwick of Guernsey (including the jurisdictions of Alderney, Guernsey and Sark); 
* the Bailiwick of Jersey;
* the Isle of Man.

The Isle of Man and the Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey are Crown Dependencies and are not a part of the United Kingdom. The Parliament of the United Kingdom on occasions introduces legislation that is extended to the islands, normally by the use of Orders in Council. For this reason it has been found useful to have a collective term for the combined territories. A statutory definition can be found in Schedule 1 of the Interpretation Act 1978.

The term The United Kingdom and the Islands is used in the Immigration Act 1971.

==Statutory definition==
Section 5 of the Interpretation Act 1978 provides that &quot;in any Act, unless the contrary intention appears&quot; the expression &quot;British Islands&quot; is to be construed according to Schedule 1 of that Act, which contains the following paragraph:

Subject to paragraph 4(2) of Schedule 2, that paragraph of Schedule 1 applies, so far as applicable, to Acts passed after the year 1889.

Paragraph 4(2) provides:
The Irish Free State was established on 6 December 1922 and the Interpretation Act 1978 came into force on 1 January 1979.

The Interpretation Act 1978 applies to itself and to any act passed after the commencement of that act and, to the extent specified in part I of schedule 2, to acts passed before the commencement of that act.

This definition of &quot;British Islands&quot; does not include the British Overseas Territories. 

===History===
The expression &quot;British Islands&quot; was formerly defined by section 18(1) of the Interpretation Act 1889 as meaning the then United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man. This definition applied to the Interpretation Act 1889 itself, and to every act passed after the commencement of that act on 1 January 1890.

Section 19 of the Lloyd&#x27;s Signal Stations Act 1888 contained a definition of &quot;British Islands&quot;. The Lloyd&#x27;s Signal Stations Act 1888 was repealed by the Lloyd&#x27;s Act 1982.

The Irish Free State left the United Kingdom on 6 December 1922 (although the latter&#x27;s full name was not changed to &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot; until the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927). On 27 March 1923 an Order in Council was made changing the default statutory interpretation of various expressions, including &quot;British Islands&quot;, &quot;United Kingdom&quot;, and &quot;Ireland&quot;; they would be interpreted within the British Islands as excluding the Irish Free State, but interpreted elsewhere in the British Empire as including the Irish Free State.

====Colonial statutes====

Section 5(2) of the Interpretation Ordinance, 1891 of British Guiana contained a definition of &quot;British Islands&quot;.

Section 2 of the Interpretation Ordinance (c 2) (1953) of British Honduras contained a definition of &quot;British Islands&quot;.

Section 28(ii) of the Interpretation and Common Form Ordinance, 1903 of the Seychelles contained a definition of &quot;British Islands&quot;.

==Law==
Section 13(3) of the Foreign and Colonial Parcel Post Warrant 1897 (SR&amp;O 1897/721) and section 6(2) of the Foreign and Colonial Post (Insured Boxes) Warrant 1908 (SR&amp;O 1908/1313) refer to &quot;the law of the British Islands&quot;.

==Inland==
===Inland postal packets===
Section 62(16) of the Inland Post Warrant 1936 (SR&amp;O 1936/618) defined the expression &quot;Inland&quot; in terms of the British Islands.

===Inland bills===
The definition of &quot;inland bill&quot; in section 4(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882 refers to the British Islands.

==Defence==
Section 26(1)(a) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 states: 

==Fisheries==
The exclusive fishery limits of the British Islands were defined by section 28 of the Sea Fisheries Act 1883. This definition was repealed by Schedule 2 to the Fishery Limits Act 1964.

The fishery limits of the British Islands were defined by section 1(1) of the Fishery Limits Act 1964. This provision was repealed by the Fishery Limits Act 1976.

==Extradition==
Francis Taylor Piggott said the effect of section 37 of the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 was to make of the British Islands one coherent whole for the purposes of that Act. That Act was repealed by Schedule 2 to the Fugitive Offenders Act 1967.

==Passports==
The expression &quot;British Islands&quot; has been included on the covers of passports of the Isle of Man, passports of Guernsey and passports of Jersey.

<text>Casasimarro is a municipality in the Province of Cuenca, in the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha, Spain.

The area has an elevation of and a continental climate, in summer and in winter. , the municipality had a population of just over 3,000. The area of Casasimarro is about 50 km.[2]

The local economy is based on agriculture and cattle raising, with the main produce being mushrooms, cereals, wine and olive oil. Industries include guitar- and carpet-making.

Casasimarro is a relatively new municipality. The oldest document that acknowledges it, is Felipe II&#x27;s &quot;Relación Topográfica&quot; in 1598. This document states the foundation of a village of the &quot;House of the Simarros&quot; (&quot;Casa de los Simarro&quot;) in 1470.

<text>Conwy Lloyd Morgan, FRS (6 February 1852 – 6 March 1936) was a British ethologist and psychologist. He is remembered for his theory of emergent evolution, and for the experimental approach to animal psychology now known as Morgan&#x27;s Canon, a principle that played a major role in behaviourism, insisting that higher mental faculties should only be considered as explanations if lower faculties could not explain a behaviour.

== Life ==
Conwy Lloyd Morgan was born in London and studied at the Royal School of Mines and subsequently under T. H. Huxley. He taught in Cape Town, but in 1884 joined the staff of the then University College, Bristol as Professor of Geology and Zoology, and carried out some research of local interest in those fields. However, he quickly became interested in the field he called &quot;mental evolution&quot;, the borderland between intelligence and instinct, and in 1901 moved to become the college&#x27;s first Professor of Psychology and Education. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1899, and gave the Croonian Lecture in 1901, titled &quot;Studies in visual sensation&quot;.

In addition to his scientific work, Lloyd Morgan was active in academic administration. He became Principal of the University College, Bristol, in 1891, playing a central role in the campaign to secure it full university status. In 1893, he enrolled his son, C. Lloyd Morgan, at Bristol&#x27;s Clifton College. In 1909, when, with the award of a Royal Charter, the University College, Bristol became the University of Bristol and he was appointed as its first Vice-Chancellor, an office he held for a year before deciding to become Professor of Psychology and Ethics until his retirement in 1919. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1926 to 1927.

Following his retirement, Lloyd Morgan delivered a series of Gifford Lectures at St. Andrews in 1921 and 1922 in which he discussed the concept of emergent evolution.

Conwy Lloyd Morgan died in Hastings.

== Ethology ==

=== Morgan&#x27;s Canon ===

Morgan&#x27;s Canon played a critical role in the growth of behaviourism in twentieth century academic psychology. The canon states: &quot;In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a higher mental faculty, if it can be interpreted as the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale.&quot; For example, Morgan considered that an entity should only be considered conscious if there is no other explanation for its behaviour.

W.H. Thorpe commented as follows:

The development of Morgan&#x27;s Canon derived partly from his observations of behaviour. This provided cases where behaviour that seemed to imply higher mental processes could be explained by simple trial and error learning (what we would now call operant conditioning). An example is the skilful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily imagined as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behaviour. Lloyd Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.

=== Instinct versus learning ===
Lloyd Morgan carried out extensive research to separate, as far as possible, inherited behaviour from learnt behaviour. Eggs of chicks, ducklings and moorhens were raised in an incubator, and the hatchlings kept from adult birds. Their behaviour after hatching was recorded in detail. Lastly, the behaviour was interpreted as simply as possible. Lloyd Morgan was not the first to work on these questions. Douglas Spalding in the 1870s had done some remarkable work on inherited behaviour in birds. His early death in 1877 led to his work being largely forgotten until the 1950s, but Lloyd Morgan cited Spalding&#x27;s observations in his own work.

<text>Franciscus Bernardus Maria de Waal (29 October 1948 – 14 March 2024) was a Dutch-American primatologist and ethologist. He was the Charles Howard Candler Professor of Primate Behavior in the Department of Psychology at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, director of the Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory, and author of numerous books including &quot;Chimpanzee Politics&quot; (1982) and &quot;Our Inner Ape&quot; (2005). His research centered on primate social behavior, including conflict resolution, cooperation, inequity aversion, and food-sharing. He was a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Early life and education==
De Waal was born in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch on 29 October 1948, to Jo and Cis de Waal. He grew up with five brothers in Waalwijk.

He studied at Radboud University Nijmegen, University of Groningen, and Utrecht University in the Netherlands. In 1977, De Waal received his doctorate in biology from Utrecht University after training as a zoologist and ethologist with professor Jan van Hooff, a well-known expert of emotional facial expression in primates. His dissertation, titled &quot;Agonistic interactions and relations among Java-monkeys&quot;, concerned aggressive behavior and alliance formation in macaques. Fellow Dutch ethologist Niko Tinbergen was an inspiration to de Waal.

==Career==
In 1975, De Waal began a six-year project on the world&#x27;s largest captive colony of chimpanzees at the Arnhem Zoo. The study resulted in many scientific papers, and resulted in the publication of his first book, &quot;Chimpanzee Politics&quot;, in 1982. This book offered the first description of primate behavior explicitly in terms of planned social strategies. De Waal was the first to introduce the thinking of Machiavelli to primatology, leading to the label &quot;Machiavellian intelligence&quot; that later became associated with it. In the mid 1990’s the book was put on a reading list for Republican House freshmen. In his writings, De Waal never shied away from attributing emotions and intentions to his primates, and as such his work inspired the field of primate cognition.

De Waal&#x27;s early work drew attention to deception and conflict resolution among primates, both of which became major areas of research. At first, his research was highly controversial and the label &quot;reconciliation&quot;, which De Waal introduced for reunions after fights, was initially questioned, but came to be fully accepted with respect to animal behavior. De Waal&#x27;s later work emphasized non-human animal empathy and the origins of morality. His most widely cited paper, written with his former student Stephanie Preston, concerns the evolutionary origin and neuroscience of empathy, not just in primates, but in mammals in general.

In the 1990s, there was resistance from editors against De Waal&#x27;s desire to publish his work on bonobos, which included potentially controversial work about bonobo sex. However, he published an article in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1995 and the book &quot;Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape&quot; in 1997. De Waal made bonobos popular and gave them a &quot;make love – not war&quot; reputation.

De Waal&#x27;s larger goal was understanding what binds primate societies together rather than how competition structures them. However, competition is not ignored in his work: the original focus of de Waal&#x27;s research was aggressive behavior and social dominance. Whereas his research focused on the behavior of nonhuman primates (mostly chimpanzees, bonobos, macaques, and capuchin monkeys), his popular books gave de Waal worldwide visibility by relating the insights he has gained from monkey and ape behavior to human society. With his students, he also worked on elephants, which were increasingly featured in his writings.

De Waal&#x27;s research into the innate capacity for empathy among primates led him to the conclusion that non-human great apes and humans are simply different types of apes, and that empathic and cooperative tendencies are continuous between these species. His belief is illustrated in the following quote from &quot;The Age of Empathy&quot;: &quot;We start out postulating sharp boundaries, such as between humans and apes, or between apes and monkeys, but are in fact dealing with sand castles that lose much of their structure when the sea of knowledge washes over them. They turn into hills, leveled ever more, until we are back to where evolutionary theory always leads us: a gently sloping beach.&quot;

This is quite opposite to the view of some economists and anthropologists, who postulate the differences between humans and other animals. However, recent work on prosocial tendencies in apes and monkeys supports de Waal&#x27;s position. See, for example, the research of Felix Warneken, a psychologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. In 2011, de Waal and his co-workers were the first to report that chimpanzees given a free choice between helping only themselves or helping themselves plus a partner, prefer the latter. In fact, de Waal does not believe these tendencies to be restricted to humans and apes, but views empathy and sympathy as universal mammalian characteristics, a view that over the past decade has gained support from studies on rodents and other mammals, such as dogs. He and his students have extensively worked on such cooperation and fairness in animals. In 2011 de Waal gave a TED Talk entitled &quot;Moral behavior in animals&quot;. Part of the talk dealt with inequity aversion among capuchin monkeys, and a video extract of this went viral. It showed the furious reaction of one monkey given a less desirable treat than another. The most recent work in this area was the first demonstration that given a chance to play the ultimatum game, chimpanzees respond in the same way as children and human adults by preferring the equitable outcome.

In 1981, de Waal moved to the United States for a position at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, and in 1991 took a position at Emory University, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was C.H. Candler Professor in the Psychology Department at Emory University and director of the Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory. He became an American citizen in 2008.

In 2005 he coined the term Veneer theory. His 2013 book &quot;The Bonobo and the Atheist&quot; examines human behavior through the eyes of a primatologist, and explores to what extent God and religion are needed for human morality. The main conclusion is that morality comes from within, and is part of human nature. The role of religion is secondary.

De Waal also wrote a column for &quot;Psychologie Magazine&quot;, a popular Dutch monthly.

From 1 September 2013, de Waal was a distinguished professor (&quot;universiteitshoogleraar&quot;) at Utrecht University. This was a part-time appointment whilst he remained in his position at Emory University, in Atlanta.

In October 2016, de Waal was the guest on the BBC Radio Four program &quot;The Life Scientific&quot;.

In June 2018, de Waal was awarded the &quot;NAT Award&quot;, established by the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona. It was awarded to de Waal &quot;for his vision regarding the evolution of animal behaviour in establishing a parallel between primate and human behaviour in aspects such as politics, empathy, morality and justice.&quot;

Two of de Waal’s last books, “Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?” (2016) and “Mama’s Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What They Tell Us About Ourselves” (2019), were best sellers.

De Waal died of stomach cancer on 14 March 2024 in Stone Mountain, Georgia. He was 75.

<text>The Ape and the Sushi Master: Cultural Reflections by a Primatologist is a popular science book by Frans de Waal. It is an overview of animal behavior and psychology, with an emphasis on primates.

It places a special emphasis on the anthropomorphological traits of primates of several different species. It also includes a short history of anthropomorphology and some of that field&#x27;s pioneers. The title is meant to reflect an analogy between how primates learn and the cultural process of how sushi-making skills are passed down from master to apprentice.

<text>The Pontiac Sunbird (also known as the Pontiac J2000 and Pontiac 2000) is a model line that was manufactured and marketed by Pontiac from the 1976 to the 1994 model years. Loosely deriving its name from the Pontiac Firebird, the Sunbird was introduced as the eventual replacement for the Pontiac Astre, replacing it entirely in 1978 as the smallest Pontiac (the later T1000 was slotted below it in size).

The first generation of the Sunbird used the subcompact GM H platform. Serving as the Pontiac counterpart of the Chevrolet Monza, the Sunbird was offered as a two-door notchback coupé and three-door hatchback and station wagon. The model was manufactured alongside the Monza, Buick Skyhawk, and Oldsmobile Starfire at Lordstown Assembly (Lordstown, Ohio), South Gate Assembly (South Gate, California) and Sainte-Thérèse Assembly (Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec), Canada.

The second generation of the Sunbird used the compact GM J platform. Serving as the Pontiac counterpart of the Chevrolet Cavalier, the Sunbird was marketed at various times as a two-door notchback coupé or convertible, three-door hatchback, four-door sedan, and five-door station wagon. The model line was manufactured alongside the Cavalier at Lordstown Assembly (Lordstown, Ohio), Ramos Arizpe Assembly (Ramos Arizpe, Mexico), and alongside the Buick Skyhawk and Oldsmobile Firenza at Leeds Assembly (Kansas City, Missouri) in 1982 only.

While not as long-running as the Bonneville, Grand Prix, and Firebird nameplates, Pontiac would use the Sunbird nameplate for 17 model years. After the Sunbird skipped the 1981 model year entirely, it was released as an early 1982 and renamed the J2000; the Sunbird name was returned for 1984. For 1995, the Sunbird underwent a substantial model update and was renamed the Pontiac Sunfire.


==First generation (1976–1980)==

Introduced in September 1975 for the 1976 model year, the first-generation Pontiac Sunbird was developed from the Pontiac Astre subcompact, slotted between the Astre and the Ventura/Phoenix within the Pontiac model line. The Pontiac counterpart of the Chevrolet Monza, the Sunbird was sportier than the Astre, competing against the Ford Mustang II, Mercury Capri and imported vehicles such as the Toyota Celica and Volkswagen Scirocco.

While sharing a nameplate, the Pontiac Sunbird shared no commonality with the Australian-market Holden LX Sunbird.

===Overview===

The first-generation Sunbird uses the GM subcompact H-body platform, sharing its 97-inch wheelbase with the Astre. Using a rear-wheel drive configuration, the Sunbird is fitted with coil springs for all four wheels, using short and long control arms for the front suspension and a torque-arm live rear axle rear suspension; both axles are fitted with an anti-roll bar. Front vented disc brakes were standard, along with rear drum brakes.

For its 1976 introduction, the Sunbird shared its standard engine with the Astre/Vega, using a Chevrolet-designed 2.3-litre inline-four, producing with a standard one-barrel carburetor; an optional two-barrel carburetor increased output to . A Buick-supplied 231 cubic-inch V6 was also optional. A four-speed manual transmission was standard, with a five-speed manual and three-speed automatic offered as options.

For 1977, the engine line was revised, with a Pontiac-developed 151 cubic-inch &quot;Iron Duke&quot; inline-four introduced; was produced with a two-barrel carburetor. For 1978, a Chevrolet-sourced 305 cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option on Sunbird coupes and hatchbacks. For 1980, the V8 option was dropped from the model line.

===Model year changes===

For 1976, the Pontiac Sunbird was offered only in a two-door notchback coupe body, sharing a body with the Chevrolet Monza Towne Coupe.

For 1977, a three-door hatchback version of the Sunbird was introduced, shared with the Chevrolet Monza, Buick Skyhawk, and Oldsmobile Starfire. A Formula option combined the handling package with a three-piece spoiler, special body decals, chrome valve cover, and a T/A steering wheel; the option was offered with the coupe and hatchback.

For 1978, a Sunbird two-door station wagon was introduced, serving as a continuation of the previous Astre wagon (using a nearly front fascia).

For 1979, the Sunbird wagon received a new horizontal grille.

For 1980, the H-body Sunbird dropped the station wagon bodystyle and the optional V8 engine. The model year underwent an unusually long production run to provide inventory into calendar-year 1981, as it was replaced by the J2000 for the 1982 model year.

In total, 479,967 examples of the H-body Sunbird were produced from the 1976 to 1980 model years. 

==Second generation (1982–1987)==
=== J2000/2000 ===
For 1982, the rear-wheel-drive Sunbird was replaced by a new front-wheel-drive compact called the &quot;J2000&quot;. Appearing as a sedan, coupe, wagon or hatchback, the J2000 was powered by a carbureted, overhead valve cast-iron 1.8-litre four-cylinder engine. Power was . During the year, this engine was joined by a new 1.8-litre four, a single overhead-cam unit with an aluminum head imported from GM of Brazil. This engine used throttle-body electronic fuel injection, in contrast to the carburetor that was used in the previous engine, making . It was initially only available in conjunction with the automatic transmission. The J2000 shared GM&#x27;s internationally used J-Body platform with the Chevrolet Cavalier, Oldsmobile Firenza, Buick Skyhawk, and Cadillac Cimarron in North America. The 1982 J2000 LE sedan was listed at $7,548 ($ in dollars). The suspension was shared with the front-wheel-drive Phoenix and 6000, which consisted of MacPherson struts, lower control arms, coil springs and a stabilizer bar for the front, while a solid beam axle, trailing arms, variable-rate coil springs for the rear suspension on all body styles were unique to the J2000.

For 1983, the &quot;J&quot; prefix was dropped. This was in an effort to market the J2000 as a smaller version of the Pontiac 6000, which had a similar appearance. A five-speed manual was newly optional along with adjustable and reclining bucket seats sourced from Lear Siegler which were also installed in the Firebird, Chevrolet Camaro and Buick Grand National. The standard engine was replaced by the fuel injected Brazilian engine, while a stroked 2-litre fuel injected version of the overhead-valve 1.8 became the optional engine, producing .

=== 2000 Sunbird ===

For 1983, Pontiac introduced a two-door J-body convertible called the 2000 Sunbird. The first Pontiac convertible outside of its full-size range since 1972, the 2000 Sunbird was the first convertible for the brand since the 1975 Pontiac Grand Ville

The entire Pontiac J-body line adopted the 2000 Sunbird name for 1984 (reviving the name of its predecessor), coinciding with a revised front fascia (updated with a less angular appearance). A new turbocharged four-cylinder was available provided by a Garrett T25 turbocharger. Based on the standard 1.8L inline-four that powered other 2000 Sunbirds, it used multi-port fuel injection, for a total output of . This engine was popular, and more powerful than many V6 engines in competing brands.

=== Sunbird ===

For 1985, the model line underwent few functional changes, with Pontiac dropping the 2000 prefix from the model nomenclature.

For 1986, the optional 2-litre four was discontinued. A GT model arrived at the top of the lineup. It featured fender flares, hidden headlamps, and the turbo engine standard. It was available in sedan, coupe, hatchback, or convertible. The GT sedan is very rare, with fewer than 5,000 sold. The GT convertible is the rarest variant, with fewer than 1,300 sold.
A redesigned gauge cluster and new engines were introduced for the 1987 model year. The gauge cluster featured different graphics, and a speedometer on turbo-equipped models, where 1984-1986 turbo models had an speedometer. The new engines were &quot;punched out&quot; versions of the 1.8L, displacing 2.0L. The base engine still used throttle-body injection, for a new total of , and the turbo still used port-injection, for a new total of . Also, the convertible could only be ordered in GT trim.


==Third Generation (1988–1994)==

Production under the Sunbird name was continued until 1994. The rear fascia was redesigned in 1988, composite headlights were installed on base models, coupes got a new semi-fastback roof line, and the four-speed manual was discontinued. The base model initially had the 1984–87 front fascia with exposed sealed beam headlamps. 1989 was the last year for the convertible GT, with the Turbo engine option dropped after 1990. The trim levels on both the sedan and coupe were base, SE and GT. The Sunbird SE coupe, SE sedan and the GT coupe and convertible had four partially concealed sealed beam headlamps, a feature that originally appeared on the Isuzu Impulse, that gave the appearance of &quot;raised eyebrows&quot; when the headlights were on. The engines were both the carryover 2.0L I4 and the turbocharged 165 horsepower 2.0L four. GM discontinued the Sunbird Safari station wagon, and 1988 was the last year models were offered. The 1988 Sunbird SE sedan was listed at $8,799 ($ in dollars ).
In 1989, the base model received a smoother, more aerodynamic front fascia and the model was renamed &quot;LE&quot;. An LE coupe joined the lineup also, with the same features as the LE sedan, but for a slightly lower price. The SE sedan was discontinued. In all models, however, a new dashboard was added. It somewhat resembled that of the larger Pontiac Grand Prix, redesigned for 1988. The most notable change from the previous dashboard is the placement of the stereo. A redesigned AM/FM stereo unit was placed high in the dash. If a cassette player or compact disc player (new for 1989) were ordered, they were relocated at the bottom of the dash.
For 1990, the GT and SE coupes received a smoother front fascia with hidden headlamps. The GT convertible is discontinued, replaced by a turbocharged LE convertible, which also retains the GT suspension and steering. In all models, GM&#x27;s passive seatbelt system was introduced. The seatbelts were mounted on the doors and would stretch out when latched.

The turbo four was deleted for 1991, replaced by the Cavalier&#x27;s 3.1L V6. With Multi-Port Fuel Injection, it produced at 5200 rpm, and of torque at 4800 rpm. Although there was less horsepower under the hood, power came much quicker and smoother than the Turbo, with about the same fuel economy. The V6 engine could be ordered in any model, save the new-for 1991 base value model. The SE coupe received the LE coupe front fascia, but the GT&#x27;s fascia could still be ordered with a sport package exclusive to SE coupes.

The largest change for the 1992 model year was a revision of the base engine. The 2.0 L SOHC TBI four was replaced with the 2.0 L SOHC MPFI four resulting in a fuel economy increase and power increase. Power was increased from to and torque increased from 118 to . NOTE: The intake manifold casting is a bit thick and responds well to port matching the head with a stock felpro gasket. An SE sedan was once again available, and the base models were dropped and the convertible moved from LE to SE.
The only change for 1993 was the addition of a glass rear window with defroster on convertibles.

As the Sunbird came to a close, the trims were pared down. The SE sedan, SE convertible and GT coupe were dropped for 1994. The LE sedan, LE coupe and LE convertible (moved from SE to LE), and SE coupe stood pat for one more year. The SE coupe was essentially the 1993 GT coupe with a lower price.

Most Sunbirds were built in Lordstown, Ohio and Ramos Arizpe, Mexico. The Sunbird was replaced by the Pontiac Sunfire in 1995.

==GT==

The Sunbird GT model was introduced in 1986 as a coupe, sedan, convertible or hatchback with a 1.8 L Garrett T25 turbocharged inline-four engine of the Family II range (LA5) as standard equipment but was never installed with an intake intercooler. The 1986 Sunbird GT convertible was listed at $14,399 ($ in dollars ). When the 1.8 L turbocharged engine was first offered in 1984 the optionally listed price was listed between $1,309 ($ in dollars ) and $1,546 ($ in dollars ) in addition to the listed retail price.

All turbos were also equipped with the WS6 performance handling package, 28mm front stabilizer bar, 21mm rear stabilizer bar, 14&quot; aluminum alloy wheels, turbo boost gauge, four speed manual transmission, or optional automatic transmission, and a tachometer. The and of torque 1.8-liter turbo engine had been available since 1984 as standard equipment in the SE and optional in the base model and LE except the station wagon. In 1987 the engine was upgraded to the 2.0-liter and of torque LT3.

All GTs featured semi-concealed headlamps over sealed beam halogen headlights, fender flares and &quot;Turbo GT&quot; badges replacing &quot;Sunbird&quot; badges. The sedan and hatchback were discontinued for 1988 and the interior for the coupe was redesigned for 1989. The convertible was dropped for 1990 and the turbo followed in 1991. Replacing the turbo four-cylinder for 1991 was GM&#x27;s 3.1-liter V6 that produced , but was quieter and smoother than the turbo. After 1993, the GT coupe became the SE coupe when the lineup was consolidated prior to the new model arriving for 1995.

== Sunbird in Mexico ==
From 1990 to 1992, Chevrolet sold the Chevrolet Cavalier in Mexico, replacing the Chevrolet Celebrity as its basic model offering. For 1993, the Mexican-market Chevrolet Cavalier adopted the Pontiac Sunbird body, rebranding it as a Chevrolet.

For the Mexican market, the only engine offered was a LB6 MPFI 2.8L V6 engine, paired to either a 5-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic transmission. The Sunbird GT was rebranded as the Cavalier Z24, standardizing the LH0 3.1L MPFI V6 engine.

For 1995, the Pontiac Sunfire was introduced to Mexico, with the Cavalier again sharing the body of its U.S. counterpart.

==Related models==
In Europe, the GM J platform was used by Vauxhall and Opel for the Vauxhall Cavalier Mk II (U.K.) and Opel Ascona (Germany and other European countries). While sharing chassis underpinnings with Sunbird, Opel and Vauxhall used their own powertrains and a slightly different exterior design; a 5-door hatchback was exclusive to the European market.

In Australia and New Zealand, the Holden Camira was a rebranded version of the Vauxhall Cavalier. Though similar in design to its American counterpart, the 5-door station wagon configuration was designed in Australia (Vauxhall Cavalier wagons/estates were produced from CKD kits).

In 1989, GM began to phase out the J platform outside of North America; the Opel Ascona was replaced by the Opel Vectra, with the Vauxhall Cavalier returning as a rebranded version of the latter. For 1990, the Holden Camira was replaced by the Holden Apollo (a rebranded Toyota Camry).

In South America, the Opel Ascona was produced in Brazil as the Chevrolet Monza from 1983 to 1996; the Ascona name did not translate favorably in Portuguese or Spanish. Sharing the body of the Ascona/Cavalier sedan, the Monza was also offered in a three-door hatchback (similar roofline to the 1982-1987 Sunbird hatchback) until 1989.

<text>[[Bern]]-[[Belp]] Regional Aerodrome , marketed as &quot;Bern Airport&quot;, officially referred to as in German, is a regional aerodrome serving Bern, the capital of Switzerland. The aerodrome is located within the town limits of Belp, and used to feature scheduled flights to some European metropolitan and several leisure destinations. It handled 183,319 passengers in 2016, a decrease of 3.5 percent over 2015.

It was the home base of now defunct SkyWork Airlines whose grounding caused the aerodrome to lose more than 1/3 of its turnover. Currently the charter operator Helvetic Airways and Peoples Airways offer a limited number of flights during the holiday season, the Swiss Federal Government&#x27;s air transport service Lufttransportdienst des Bundes have based two business jets at the aerodrome, the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service operator REGA has one of its bases at Belp and two helicopter transport companies as well as two flying schools (one motorised, one for gliders) operate at the aerodrome.

==History==
The aerodrome was established in 1929 by Alpar, a private airline that operated within Switzerland until the outbreak of World War II. After the war, Alpar remained in business as the aerodrome&#x27;s operator, supported by subsidies of the cantonal and city government. A planned expansion in 1947 did not pass in a popular referendum, and it was not until 1950 that the first concrete airstrip was built. In 2014, Alpar was renamed to &quot;Flughafen Bern AG&quot;.

Multiple attempts to build an international airport in or around Bern instead of the small regional aerodrome at Belpmoos failed. In 1945, the national parliament decided to build the first international airport, now Zurich Airport, at Kloten near Zürich instead of in Utzensdorf near Bern, though plans for development there were retained as an inter-urban airport which would require less space and thus placate local opposition by farming interests. A 1963 airport project near Herrenschwanden was abandoned because of strong popular opposition, notably by farmers, as was a 1966 project in Rosshäusern and a 1970 project Kallnach.

In December 2016, bmi regional ceased its flights from Munich Airport to Bern after two years which it served in direct competition with SkyWork Airlines. In May 2018, RUAG announced that it would close its operation at the aerodrome in September 2018, citing declining business.

In August 2018, the aerodrome&#x27;s largest carrier SkyWork Airlines declared bankruptcy and ceased all operations leaving Helvetic Airways as the sole Swiss airline serving the aerodrome with 84 percent less traffic. Since then however, Chair Airlines, also a Swiss Airline, has begun offering services to the airport.

==Facilities==

The aerodrome has multiple touchdown areas, a paved runway (14/32 of 1,730 metres (5,676 ft)), a grass runway (32L/14R of 650 metres (2,133 ft, as of 2017 inoperable)), a heli-square, and a glider area. Runway 14 has an ILS approach and an NDB approach (for training use only, will be decommissioned in 2019). The existing terminal was expanded to better accommodate flights to the non-Schengen area in 2011.

The &quot;Biderhangar&quot;, one of the aerodrome&#x27;s hangars built by Swiss aviation pioneer Oskar Bider, is listed as a heritage site of national significance. The aerodrome also houses the head office of Heliswiss. Previously the North Terminal housed the head office of SkyWork Airlines.

==Other usage==
The aircraft of the air transport service of the Swiss Air Force are stationed at Bern Regional Aerodrome. These are two jets and two turboprops. The former ones are mainly used for VIP transport and particularly the transport of members of the Federal Council. They are also used for other purposes, for example deportations or to support international peacekeeping measures. The two turboprop DHC-6 Twin Otter and Beechcraft King Air are not usually used for VIP flights, but for the passenger transport as well as for the country&#x27;s topography service. The Beechcraft 1900 is also used by the country&#x27;s topography service for the same tasks. The two jets are a Dassault Falcon 900 and a Cessna Citation Excel.

Additionally, Bern Regional Aerodrome serves as the homebase of the Federal Office of Civil Aviation. A base of the air rescue organization Rega is also located at the Airport, using a Eurocopter EC 145.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines currently offer seasonal and seasonal charter flights at Bern Airport:


==Statistics==

==Ground transportation==
Two bus lines serve the airport: the &quot;AirportBus Bern&quot; (line 334) connects the terminal every half-hour with Belp railway station where passengers can connect to frequent S-Bahn trains S3, S4, S31 and S44 to Bern main station. The journey time to Bern city center is 30 minutes. The bus line 160 connects the airport with Belp, Rubigen and Münsingen (connection to S-Bahn trains S1).

<doc id="377100" wikidata="Q3395765" url="?curid=377100" title="Modern literature in Irish">
<text>Although Irish has been used as a literary language for more than 1,500 years (see Irish literature), and modern literature in Irish dates – as in most European languages – to the 16th century, modern Irish literature owes much of its popularity to the 19th century Gaelic Revival, a cultural and language revival movement, and to the efforts of more recent poets and writers. In an act of literary decolonization common to many other peoples seeking self-determination, writers in Irish have taken the advice of Patrick Pearse and have combined influences from both their own literary history and the whole of world literature. Writers in Modern Irish have accordingly produced some of the most interesting literature to come out of Ireland, while being both supplemented and influenced by poetry and prose composed in the Irish language outside Ireland.

==Early revival==
By the end of the nineteenth century, Irish had been reversed from being the dominant language of Ireland to becoming a minority language, which reduced the literature being produced. The Gaelic Revival sought to reverse this decline. In the beginning, the revivalists preferred to write in Classical Irish, and were notably inspired by Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s (Seathrún Céitinn) &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot; (History of Ireland), a much-read 17th-century work. Classical Irish, however, was soon ousted by the living dialects actually being spoken in the Gaeltacht areas, especially as championed by a native speaker from the Coolea-Muskerry area, Father Peadar Ua Laoghaire, who in the 1890s published, in a serialised form, a folkloristic novel strongly influenced by the storytelling tradition of the Gaeltacht, called &quot;&quot;. His other works include the autobiography &quot;Mo Scéal Féin&quot; and retellings of tales from Irish mythology, as well as a recently reissued adaptation of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

Pádraic Ó Conaire was a pioneer in the writing of realistic short stories in Irish; he was also to the forefront of Irish-language journalism. His most important book is his only novel, &quot;Deoraíocht&quot; (&quot;Exile&quot;), which combines realism with absurdist elements. He was to die in 1928, not yet fifty years old. Ó Conaire became something of a mythical figure in Irish literary folklore because of his highly individual talent and engaging personality.

==Early twentieth-century writing from the Gaeltacht==
From the end of the 19th century, researchers were visiting the Gaeltacht to record the lives of native speakers in authentic dialect. This interest from outside stimulated several notable autobiographies, especially on Great Blasket Island, located off the Dingle Peninsula: &quot;Peig&quot; by Peig Sayers, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Islandman&quot;) by Tomás Ó Criomhthain, and &quot;Fiche Bliain ag Fás&quot; (&quot;Twenty Years a-Growing&quot;) by Muiris Ó Súilleabháin.

Although he greatly admired these Gaeltacht memoirs and particularly that of Tomás Ó Criomhthain, novelist Flann O&#x27;Brien also chose to satirize their cliches quite mercilessly in his modernist novel &quot;An Béal Bocht&quot; (&quot;The Poor Mouth&quot;), which is set in the fictional, desperately poor, and constantly raining Gaeltacht of (); a parody of , the name in Munster Irish for the Dingle Peninsula.

Micí Mac Gabhann was the author of &quot;Rotha Mór an tSaoil&quot; (&quot;The Great Wheel of Life&quot;), dictated in his native Ulster Irish. The title refers to the Klondike gold rush, &quot;ruathar an óir&quot;, at the end of the 19th century, and the hardship Irish gold-seekers endured on their way to &quot;tír an óir&quot;, the gold country.

Another important figure was the prolific writer of rural novels, Séamus Ó Grianna (pen name &quot;Máire&quot;). Séamus Ó Grianna&#x27;s most important contribution to modern literature in the language might be the fact that he persuaded his brother Seosamh (who called himself Seosamh Mac Grianna in Irish) to write in Irish. Seosamh was a less prolific and less fortunate writer than his brother. He was stricken by a severe depressive psychosis in 1935 and spent the rest of his life – more than fifty years – at a psychiatric hospital. Before his psychosis, however, he wrote an impressive novel about the difficult transition to modernity in his own Gaeltacht, called &quot;An Druma Mór&quot; (&quot;The Big Drum&quot; or &quot;The Fife and Drum Band&quot;), as well as a powerful and introspective account of his travels called &quot;Mo Bhealach Féin&quot; (&quot;My Own Way&quot;). His last novel, &quot;Dá mBíodh Ruball ar an Éan&quot; (&quot;If the Bird Had a Tail&quot;), a study of the alienation of a Gaeltacht man in Dublin, was left unfinished, a fact suggested by the title.

Both brothers were acknowledged translators. In addition to translating Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; into Irish, Seosamh&#x27;s work in this field includes the Irish versions of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Almayer&#x27;s Folly,&quot; in Irish &quot;Díth Céille Almayer&quot;, as well as Peadar O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s &quot;Adrigoole&quot;, in Irish &quot;Eadarbhaile&quot;.

==Irish-language modernism==
Patrick Pearse, who was executed as one of the leaders of the Easter Rising, learnt Connaught Irish in Rosmuc, while continuing to write in Munster Irish. He also wrote idealised stories about the Irish-speaking countryside, as well as nationalistic poetry in a more classical, Keating-esque style.

According to Louis De Paor, Pearse&#x27;s reading of the experimental free verse poetry of Walt Whitman and of the French Symbolists led him to introduce Modernist poetry into the Irish language. As a literary critic, Pearse also left behind a detailed blueprint for the Decolonization of Irish literature, through drawing not only upon Irish mythology and folklore, but also from the whole of world literature, both past and present. For these reasons, Liam De Paor has called Pearse&#x27;s execution by a British Army firing squad after the defeat of the 1916 Easter Rising a catastrophic loss for Irish literature which only began to be healed during the late 1940s by the modernist poetry of Seán Ó Ríordáin, Máirtín Ó Direáin, and Máire Mhac an tSaoi.

Ó Direáin, a native Irish speaker and passionate autodidact from Inishmore in the Aran Islands, spent his life as a career civil servant in Galway City and Dublin in the aftermath of the Irish Civil War. He began publishing his work in the early 1940s as a poet of homesickness and urban angst and ended, quite similarly to his literary hero T.S. Eliot, as a harsh cultural critic of escalating Secularization, hedonism, and excessive consumerism.

Máire Mhac an tSaoi, who was also an accomplished Celticist and literary scholar, published several collections of lyric verse beginning in the 1950s. These display her mastery of both the strict metres (Dán Díreach), once taught and widely used before the 17th century closing of the Irish bardic poetry schools, and of the colloquial folk song metres (Amhrán) that replaced them until the early Gaelic revival. In 2013, she also published a literary translation of Rainer Maria Rilke&#x27;s &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; from Austrian German into Modern Irish.

Ó Ríordáin was born in the Ballyvourney breac-Gaeltacht: his poetry was experimental enough in metre to draw attacks from literary traditionalists, while also being intensely personal in content. He was also a notable prose writer, as evidenced by his published diaries.

Modernist literature was developed further by Máirtín Ó Cadhain, a schoolmaster from Connemara, who was the Irish-language &quot;littérateur engagé&quot; par excellence. He was an active service in the IRA, and spent The Emergency years (i.e. the years of Irish neutrality in the Second World War) interned in the Curragh Camp, County Kildare, together with other IRA men and Allied and Axis military personnel. At the camp, he taught Irish language courses to fellow internees and began his modernist masterpiece, the novel &quot;Cré na Cille&quot; (&quot;Graveyard Clay&quot;). Reminiscent of some Latin American novels (notably &quot;Redoble por Rancas&quot; by Manuel Scorza, or &quot;Pedro Páramo&quot; by Juan Rulfo), this novel is a chain of voices of the dead speaking from the churchyard, where they go on forever continuing the now pointless social and political quarrels from when they were alive. Similarly to those of Flann O&#x27;Brien, Ó Cadhain&#x27;s novel lampoons the rose-coloured depiction of life in the Gaeltachtaí favored by the romantic nationalist writers of the early Gaelic revival.

In addition to &quot;Cré na Cille&quot;, Máirtín Ó Cadhain wrote several collections of short stories (one &#x27;short&#x27; story, &quot;Fuíoll Fuine&quot; in the collection , can count as a novella). An important part of his writings is his journalism, essays, and pamphlets, found in such collections as &quot;Ó Cadhain i bhFeasta&quot;, &quot;Caiscín&quot;, and &quot;Caithfear Éisteacht&quot;.

Máirtín Ó Cadhain&#x27;s prose is dense, powerful and (especially in his early work) difficult for the novice. His style changed and became simpler with time, in part reflecting the urban world in which he settled. Like the poet Liam Gógan, Ó Cadhain was a linguistic moderniser and wrote in an experimental form of the Irish language, even in contexts where a less obscure style would have been appropriate. He enriched his own Connemara Irish with neologisms and loanwords from other dialects, including Scottish Gaelic.

Modernism and renewal are also represented by several writers not of Gaeltacht background, such as Eoghan Ó Tuairisc, Diarmaid Ó Súilleabháin, and Breandán Ó Doibhlin (the last influenced by French literary theory). Ó Tuairisc, a stylistic innovator, wrote poetry and plays as well as two novels on historical themes: &quot;L&#x27;Attaque&quot;, and &quot;Dé Luain&quot;. Diarmaid Ó Súilleabháin sought to adapt Irish to the urban world: &quot;An Uain Bheo&quot; and &quot;Caoin Thú Féin&quot; offered a depiction of a middle-class environment and its problems. Ó Doibhlin&#x27;s &quot;Néal Maidine agus Tine Oíche&quot; is an example of introspective modernism.

==Contemporary literature in Irish==
Among modern Gaeltacht writers, Pádraig Breathnach, Micheál Ó Conghaile and Pádraig Ó Cíobháin are three of the most important. They adhere in general to the realist tradition, as does Dara Ó Conaola. The work of Joe Steve Ó Neachtain, from the Conamara Gaeltacht, has proved consistently popular.

Caitlín Maude (d. 1982), a native speaker from Conamara, wrote fluent and elegant verse with a distinctively modern sensibility. One of the best known poets is Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill, who was raised in the Munster Gaeltacht and was part of the new wave of the sixties and seventies. She is particularly interested in the mythic element in reality. Biddy Jenkinson (a pseudonym) is representative of an urban tradition: she is a poet and a writer of witty detective stories.

Others of Ní Dhomhnaill&#x27;s generation were the mordant Michael Hartnett (who wrote both in Irish and English) and Michael Davitt (d.2005), a lyric poet whose work is both whimsical and melancholy. Others of his generation are Liam Ó Muirthile and Gabriel Rosenstock. Among those who followed are Cathal Ó Searcaigh, Tomás Mac Síomóin, Diarmuid Johnson and Louis de Paor. Ó Searcaigh, a lyric poet, is also a traveller: this bore fruit in his engaging travelogue about Nepal, &quot;Seal i Neipeal&quot;. A younger generation is represented by such poets as Doireann Ní Ghríofa (b.1981).

There is now more emphasis on popular writing in Irish, and among the writers who have had considerable success with lighter genres is Éilís Ní Dhuibhne, novelist, playwright and short story writer. Lorcán S. Ó Treasaigh has written a popular autobiography called &quot;Céard é English?&quot; (&quot;What is English?&quot;) about growing up as a native Irish speaker in the predominantly English-speaking city of Dublin. Colm Ó Snodaigh&#x27;s novella, &quot;Pat the Pipe - Píobaire&quot;, describes a busker&#x27;s adventures in Dublin&#x27;s streets in the nineties.

The short story remains a popular genre. Donncha Ó Céileachair and Síle Ní Chéileachair, brother and sister, published the influential collection &quot;Bullaí Mhártain&quot; in 1955, dealing with both urban and rural themes. In 1953 Liam O&#x27;Flaherty (Liam Ó Flaithearta) published the collection &quot;Dúil&quot;. O&#x27;Flaherty was raised for the first twelve years of his life with Irish on the Aran Islands, but &quot;Dúil&quot; was his only work in Irish. One of the best known of contemporary practitioners is Seán Mac Mathúna (who also writes in English). His work is characterised by humour and a poetic realism and has been praised for its originality. A writer of a more recent generation is Daithí Ó Muirí. The drive, black humour and absurdist quality of his work distinguish it from the realism of much modern writing in Irish.

==Writers in Irish abroad==

Countries other than Ireland have produced several contributors to literature in Irish, reflecting the existence globally of a group who have learned or who cultivate the language. It is worthy of note that these writers and their readers do not always form part of the traditional diaspora. It has been argued that the use of the language by non-Irish writers has nothing to do with a specifically Irish identity. Instead, its importance lies in its use value as a language of work, personal relationships and creativity. A number of such writers, both Irish and foreign-born, are to be found in North America, Australia and various European countries.

Dutch-born Alex Hijmans (formerly resident in Ireland and now living in Brazil) has published three books in Irish: an account of his life in Brazil, &quot;Favela&quot; (2009); a novel, &quot;Aiséirí&quot; (2011); and a collection of short stories, &quot;Gonta&quot; (2012).

Panu Petteri Höglund, a linguist, writer and translator, belongs to Finland&#x27;s Swedish-speaking minority. He uses Irish as a creative medium, and has set himself the goal of producing entertaining and modern writing in an Irish up to Gaeltacht standards. For a long time he experimented with Ulster Irish on the Web, but he published his first book in standard Irish, albeit strongly influenced by native folklore and dialects. He has published several novels, none of them set in Ireland.

Torlach Mac Con Midhe was born in Dublin and now lives in Switzerland. He has published journalism in Irish, German and Romansh. He has published three non-fiction books in Irish: &quot;Iarsmaí na Teanga: Na Teangacha Ceilteacha i Stair Smaointeachas na hEorpa&quot; (Coiscéim 2005), &quot;Muintir Sléibhe agus a Teanga&quot; (Coiscéim 2009), &quot;Aistí Eorpacha&quot; (Coiscéim 2015); and a novel, &quot;Crothla agus Cnámha&quot; (Coiscéim 2018).

Dublin-born writer Tomás Mac Síomóin, who died in 2022, had been living in Barcelona since 1997. He published over a dozen works in Irish in this period, as well as translations from Spanish and Catalan.

Seán Ó Muirgheasa, an American resident in California, is the author of &quot;An Dola a Íoc&quot;, a detective novel set in New York City and published by Coiscéim in 2017.

Séamas Ó Neachtain is a fifth-generation Irish American who has published poetry, fiction and journalism in Irish. He is also the founding editor of &quot;An Gael&quot;, an international literary journal in the Irish language.

Muiris (Mossie) Ó Scanláin, a native speaker of Munster Irish from the Kerry Gaeltacht who lived in Melbourne for many years, is the author of an autobiography, &quot;An Mám ó Dheas&quot;, published when he resided in Australia and describing his life in Ireland, England and Australia.

Derry-born Pádraig Ó Siadhail (b. 1968) has been living in Halifax, Nova Scotia, since 1987. In this period, he has published ten works in Irish, including a collection of short stories and two novels.

Bantry-born Derry O&#x27;Sullivan has been living in Paris since 1969, apart from an interlude in Stockholm. He has published four collections of poetry in Irish.

Colin Ryan is an Australian whose short stories, set mostly in Australia and Europe, have appeared in the journals &quot;Feasta&quot;, &quot;Comhar&quot; and &quot;An Gael&quot;. He has also published poetry. Cló Iar-Chonnacht has published two collections of short stories by him: &quot;Teachtaireacht&quot; (2015) and &quot;Ceo Bruithne&quot; (2019). Two collections of his poetry have been published by Coiscéim: &quot;Corraí na Nathrach&quot; (2017) and &quot;Rogha&quot; (2022)

Julie Breathnach-Banwait is an Australian citizen of Irish origin living in Western Australia. She is the author of: &quot;Dánta Póca&quot; (2020) &quot;Ar Thóir gach Ní&quot; (2022) and &quot;Cnámha Scoilte&quot; (2023). She has had many publications in various literary magazines and anthologies both in Ireland and Australia.

== Literary magazines ==

The oldest Irish-language literary magazines responsible for the encouragement of poetry and short fiction are &quot;Comhar&quot; (founded in 1942) and &quot;Feasta&quot; (founded in 1948). The latter, presently edited by Cormac Ó hAodha, is the journal of the Gaelic League, though it has an independent editorial policy. Both magazines publish short fiction and poetry: the manifesto of &quot;Feasta&quot; also declares that one of its objects is to encourage students to write in Irish. &quot;Feasta&quot; has enjoyed more stability than Comhar, which suffered from a declining readership and has now been reconstituted. The withdrawal of support by Foras na Gaeilge, a major source of subsidies, may affect their future. Both magazines have had as contributors some of the most notable figures in modern Irish-language literature, and continue to encourage new writing.

They have since been joined by &quot;An Gael&quot;, an international literary magazine established in North America but publishing prose and poetry in Irish by writers from a number of different countries, including Ireland, Australia and Finland.

&quot;Oghma&quot; was a literary journal in the Irish language published from 1989 to 1998.

== Irish-language writing in local context ==

There are presently over 2,500 works of various kinds in print in Irish, of which the largest proportion is literature (over 2,000, including novels, short stories and poetry), children&#x27;s books and educational material.

It has been remarked that the average print run for a book of poetry or prose is probably 500, though a popular work of detective fiction might have a print run of 2,000.

Among the genres least cultivated in Irish is science fiction (a fact possible related to the dearth of popular science writing in the language, despite a wealth of available terminology). The American-based magazine &quot;An Gael&quot; has, however, published serials with elements of fantasy and the surreal.

<text>The Pontiac Sunfire is a compact car by Pontiac that was introduced for the 1995 model year to replace the Sunbird. Not only was the name changed, but dramatic styling changes were included as well. The new styling was shared with the redesigned Chevrolet Cavalier. The J platform was updated structurally to meet more stringent safety standards for the 1996 model year.

The Pontiac Sunfire went through two facelifts in its 11-year run: a small redesign in 2000 featuring the heavy plastic cladding look that was prevalent with Pontiac at the time, and a more streamlined update in 2003. In the US, the coupe was the only model available from 2003 to 2005. The sedan continued to be sold in Canada and Mexico until the end of production on June 22, 2005. GM replaced the Sunfire with the G5 for the 2006 model year in Canada and the 2007 model year in the United States.

== Technical ==
* 1995 – &quot;Quad 4 (RPO: LD2)&quot; I4, 150 hp (116 kW) and 
*1995-134cu-in 2200 OHV 120hp 140tq
* 1996–2002 &quot;2200 (RPO: LN2)&quot; I4, and 
* 1996–2002 – &quot;Twin Cam (RPO: LD9)&quot; I4, and 
* 2002–2005 – &quot;Ecotec (RPO: L61)&quot; I4, and 

The base model had the 2.2 L engine from 1994 until 2002. The GT trim level had an optional, more powerful 2.3 L Quad 4 engine from 1994 to 1995, which was replaced by the 2.4 L LD9 engine in 1995. The 2.3 and 2.4 litre engines were optional in the 2 and 4 door LS trim level. In 2003, both the 2.2 L and the 2.4 L engines were replaced by the 2.2 L Ecotec engine, and would be the only powertrain available for the remainder of production. The Ecotec engine was also an option for the 2002 model year.
At the time of introduction, the Sunfire was available with a three-speed automatic or a five-speed manual. General Motors had envisioned introducing a new four-speed automatic with the new car, but the company&#x27;s cash shortage delayed this option until the next year.

==Trim levels==
The Sunfire could be purchased as a sedan, coupe, or convertible. All three variations came in the standard SE trim level. An upscale GT trim level was available on the coupe and convertible. The GT trim level came standard with the 2.3 litre LD2 engine from 1994 to 1995 or the 2.4 litre LD9 &quot;Twin Cam&quot; engine (1996–2002), 16-inch alloy wheels, dual exhaust, and a more aggressive looking front fascia. The SE trim was the standard for the Sunfire which included the 2.2 litre 2200 OHV Engine. The 2.3/2.4 DOHC Engine was optional. Both the SE and GT trim levels were dropped after the 2002 model year, along with the 2.2 OHV and 2.4 DOHC engines. The 2.2 litre Ecotec was the only available engine as of the 2002 model year.

Originally, the convertible was only in the SE trim level until the 1999 model year where it became only available in the GT trim. The convertible was discontinued after the 2000 model year. All Sunfire convertibles were assembled at the &quot;Genesis&quot; Lansing, Michigan Plant. At its introduction from 1995 until 2001 the rear of the vehicle on coupes has the brand name &quot;Pontiac&quot; between the tail lights, and the trim panel is backlit when the vehicle is on using license plate bulbs installed in the trunk. As vehicles are passed from one owner to another, the panel is not illuminated due to the owners not being aware of the feature.

Prices in 1995 Range from A base sedan at $10,243 (), all the way to a $14,195 coupe GT (). In 2005 The Pontiac Sunfire had a base price of $15,205 ().

<text>Blandings Castle is a recurring fictional location in the stories of British comic writer P. G. Wodehouse, being the seat of Lord Emsworth (Clarence Threepwood, 9th Earl of Emsworth), home to many of his family and the setting for numerous tales and adventures. The stories were written between 1915 and 1975.

The series of stories taking place at the castle, in its environs and involving its denizens have come to be known as the &quot;Blandings books&quot;, or, in a phrase used by Wodehouse in his preface to the 1969 reprint of the first book, &quot;the Blandings Castle Saga&quot;.

In a radio broadcast on 15 July 1961, Evelyn Waugh said: &quot;The gardens of Blandings Castle are that original garden from which we are all exiled.&quot;

==The Castle==
Blandings Castle, lying in the picturesque Vale of Blandings, Shropshire, England, is from the town of Market Blandings, home to at least nine pubs, most notably the Emsworth Arms.

The tiny hamlet of Blandings Parva lies directly outside the castle gates and the town of Much Matchingham, home to Matchingham Hall, the residence of Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe, is also nearby.

The castle is a noble pile, of Early Tudor building (&quot;its history is recorded in England&#x27;s history books and Viollet-le-Duc has written of its architecture&quot;, according to &quot;Something Fresh&quot;). One of England&#x27;s largest stately homes, it dominates the surrounding country, standing on a knoll of rising ground at the southern end of the celebrated Vale of Blandings; the Severn gleams in the distance. From its noble battlements, the Wrekin can be seen.

The famous moss-carpeted Yew Alley (subject to the devious gravelling schemes of Angus McAllister) leads to a small wood with a rough gamekeeper&#x27;s cottage, which Psmith made use of, not to write poetry as he at first claimed, but to stash stolen jewellery. Another gamekeeper&#x27;s cottage, in the West Wood, makes a pleasant home for the Empress of Blandings for a spell. The rose garden is another famous beauty spot, ideal for courting lovers. There is a lake, where Lord Emsworth often takes a brisk swim in the mornings.

The house has numerous guest rooms, many of which have not been used since Queen Elizabeth roamed the country. Of those still in use, the Garden Room is the finest, usually given to the most prestigious guest; it has a balcony outside its French windows, which can be easily accessed via a handy drainpipe.

The main library has a smaller library leading off it, and windows overlooking some flowerbeds; it is here that Lord Emsworth is often to be found on wet days, his nose deep in an improving tome of country lore, his favourite being Whiffle on &quot;The Care of the Pig&quot;.

===Possible locations===
There have been a number of attempts to identify a real building whose location Wodehouse might have used as the setting for the fictional Blandings Castle:

* In 1977, Richard Usborne included a report by railway historian Michael Cobb in an appendix to the unfinished &quot;Sunset at Blandings&quot;. Based on details of train journeys and travel times given in Wodehouse&#x27;s stories, Cobb argued that Buildwas in Shropshire best fitted the description of Market Blandings, thus placing Blandings Castle at one of two locations nearby. However, in a parenthetical aside, he asked whether &quot;anyone ha[d] considered that Blandings Castle was really Apley Park&quot; (or Hall). Apley Park (or Hall) is less than from Buildwas.
* In 1986, Norman Murphy, in his &quot;In Search of Blandings&quot;, looked at a whole range of criteria based around architecture and landscape features. His main suggestions were Sudeley Castle, Gloucestershire for the castle itself, and Weston Park, Staffordshire for the gardens. The owners of Sudeley, also the resting place of Queen Katherine Parr, have since emphasised the Wodehouse connection.
* In 1999, Norman Murphy again suggested Hunstanton Hall in Norfolk, the home of the LeStrange family from 1137 to 1954, where Wodehouse visited in the 1920s, as inspiration for Blandings, its master, and &quot;the real Empress of Blandings&quot;.
* In 2003, Dr Daryl Lloyd and Dr Ian Greatbatch (two researchers in the Department of Geography and Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London) made use of a Geographic Information System to analyse a set of geographical criteria, such as a viewshed analysis of The Wrekin and drive time from Shrewsbury. Their final conclusion was that Apley Hall was the best suited location for fulfilling the geographical criteria.

==Residents and guests==
===The family===
The master of Blandings is, nominally at least, Lord Emsworth. Clarence, the ninth Earl, is an amiably absent-minded old chap, who is charming because of his slow, relaxed lifestyle and the simple obsessions that make him oblivious to the absurd melodrama of his family, namely his home, gardens, pumpkins, and his champion pig, Empress of Blandings. He is never happier than when pottering about the grounds on a fine sunny day.

Lord Emsworth&#x27;s ten sisters (all of whom look like the &quot;daughter of a hundred earls&quot;, except for Hermione, who looks like a cook), his brother Galahad (&quot;Gally&quot;), his daughter Mildred, his sons Freddie and George, and his numerous nieces, nephews, and in-laws inhabit the castle from time to time. For the Threepwood family, and their friends, the castle is forever available for indefinite residence, and is occasionally used as a temporary prison—known as &quot;Devil&#x27;s Island&quot; or &quot;The Bastille&quot;—for love-struck young men and ladies to calm down.

Emsworth&#x27;s sister Ann plays the role of châtelaine when we first visit the Castle, in &quot;Something Fresh&quot;. Following her reign, Lady Constance Keeble usually acts as châtelaine until she marries American millionaire James Schoonmaker and spends most of her time in America. Another married sister, Hermione, takes over the duties when Constance is traveling, or otherwise unavailable. While all of Lord Emsworth&#x27;s sisters are &#x27;take-charge&#x27; types, Constance (&quot;Connie&quot;) in particular has a very domineering and impatient temperament, as well as a cutting vocabulary; Clarence lives in dread of her occasional return visits to the Castle.

Lady Julia Fish (another sister) is &quot;the iron hand beneath the leather glove&quot;, whose son Ronald Fish (&quot;Ronnie&quot;) marries a chorus girl named Sue Brown, much to her displeasure. Sue is the daughter of the only woman whom Gally ever loved—Dolly Henderson—though Gally insists Sue is not Ronnie&#x27;s cousin.

The other sisters (not all of whom are seen, as they are married and live elsewhere) are: Charlotte, Dora, Florence, Georgiana, Jane (deceased), and Diana, the only one that Gally likes (&quot;Sunset at Blandings&quot;). They have a third brother, who has died, called Lancelot.

===The staff===
Blandings&#x27;s ever-present butler is Sebastian Beach, with eighteen years service at the castle under his ample belt, and its other domestic servants have at various times included Mrs Twemlow the housekeeper, an under-butler named Merridew, and a number of footmen, such as Charles, Thomas, Stokes, James and Alfred. The chauffeurs Slingsby and Alfred Voules drive the castle&#x27;s stately Hispano-Suiza, or, in an emergency, the Albatross or the Antelope (&quot;Summer Lightning&quot;). Scottish head gardeners Thorne and Angus McAllister have tended the grounds, while George Cyril Wellbeloved, James Pirbright and the Amazonian Monica Simmons have each in turn taken care of Lord Emsworth&#x27;s beloved prize pig, Empress of Blandings.

Emsworth has employed a series of secretaries, most notable among them Rupert Baxter, the highly efficient young man who never seems to be able to keep away from Blandings, despite Lord Emsworth&#x27;s increasingly low opinion of his sanity. He was succeeded in the post by Ronald Psmith, and later by the likes of Hugo Carmody and Monty Bodkin. The castle&#x27;s splendid library was catalogued, for the first time since 1885, by Eve Halliday.

===Notable visitors===
Many people pass through the doors of Blandings, including guests and friends of the family, prospective additions to the family, temporary staff, pig-lovers, day-trippers, detectives, crooks and of course impostors galore. Among the most distinguished are the grumpy Duke of Dunstable; leading brain-specialist Sir Roderick Glossop; publishing magnate Lord Tilbury; the fifth Earl of Ickenham, known to all as Uncle Fred; and Percy Pilbeam, head of the Argus Enquiry Agency employed to locate the lost pig and recover Gally&#x27;s manuscript of his memoirs.

==Books==
Blandings Castle serves as the setting for eleven novels and nine short stories.

* &quot;Something Fresh&quot; (1915) — Also published under the title &quot;Something New&quot;.
* &quot;Leave it to Psmith&quot; (1923)
* &quot;Blandings Castle and Elsewhere&quot; (1935) – Six short stories of twelve, written from 1924 to 1931, occurring before the events of &quot;Summer Lightning&quot;:
** &quot;The Custody of the Pumpkin&quot;
** &quot;Lord Emsworth Acts for the Best&quot;
** &quot;Pig-hoo-o-o-o-ey&quot;
** &quot;Company for Gertrude&quot;
** &quot;The Go-getter&quot;
** &quot;Lord Emsworth and the Girl Friend&quot;
* &quot;Summer Lightning&quot; (1929)
* &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; (1933)
* &quot;Lord Emsworth and Others&quot; (1937) – One short story of nine:
** &quot;The Crime Wave at Blandings&quot;
* &quot;Uncle Fred in the Springtime&quot; (1939)
* &quot;Full Moon&quot; (1947)
* &quot;Nothing Serious&quot; (1950) – One short story of ten:

** &quot;Sticky Wicket at Blandings&quot;
* &quot;A Pelican at Blandings&quot; (1969)
* &quot;Sunset at Blandings&quot; (1977)

Wodehouse worked on &quot;Sunset at Blandings&quot; until his death, writing even in his hospital bed. It was unfinished and untitled when he died, and was subsequently edited (by Richard Usborne) and released in its incomplete form with extensive notes on the content.

All nine Blandings short stories were collected together in one volume entitled &quot;Lord Emsworth Acts for the Best&quot; in 1992.

The Folio Society published a six volume set &quot;The Best of Blandings&quot; consisting of &quot;Summer Lightning, Heavy Weather, Uncle Fred in the Springtime, Full Moon, Pigs Have Wings,&quot; and &quot;Service with a Smile&quot;.

<text>George John Romanes (20 May 1848 – 23 May 1894) was a Canadian-Scots evolutionary biologist and physiologist who laid the foundation of what he called comparative psychology, postulating a similarity of cognitive processes and mechanisms between humans and other animals.

He was the youngest of Charles Darwin&#x27;s academic friends, and his views on evolution are historically important. He popularized the term neo-Darwinism, which in the late 19th century was considered as a theory of evolution that focuses on natural selection as the main evolutionary force. Romanes&#x27; early death was a loss to the cause of evolutionary biology in Britain. Within six years Mendel&#x27;s work was rediscovered, and a whole new agenda opened up for debate.

George Romanes was born in Kingston, Canada West (now Ontario), in 1848, the youngest of three children, all boys, in a well-to-do and intellectually cultivated family. His father was Rev George Romanes (1805–1871), a Scottish Presbyterian minister. Two years after his birth, his parents moved to Cornwall Terrace in London, United Kingdom, which would set Romanes on the path to a fruitful and lasting relationship with Charles Darwin. During his youth, Romanes resided temporarily in Germany and Italy, developing a fluency in both German and Italian. His early education was inconsistent, undertaken partly in public schools, and partly at home. He developed an early love for poetry and music, at which he excelled. However, his true passion resided elsewhere, and the young Romanes decided to study science, abandoning a prior ambition to become a clergyman like his father.

==Adulthood==
Although he came from an educated home, his school education was erratic. He entered university half-educated and with little knowledge of the ways of the world. He studied medicine and physiology, graduating from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge with the degree of BA in 1871, and is commemorated there by a stained glass window in the chapel.

It was at Cambridge that he came first to the attention of Charles Darwin: &quot;How glad I am that you are so young!&quot; said Darwin. 
 Forging a relationship with Darwin was not difficult for Romanes, who reputedly inherited a &quot;sweetness of temper and calmness of manner&quot; from his father. The two remained friends for life. Guided by Michael Foster, Romanes continued to work on the physiology of invertebrates at University College London under William Sharpey and Burdon-Sanderson. In 1879, at 31, Romanes was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on the basis of his work on the nervous systems of medusae. However, Romanes&#x27; tendency to support his claims by anecdotal evidence rather than empirical tests prompted Lloyd Morgan&#x27;s warning known as Morgan&#x27;s Canon:
:&quot;In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development&quot;.

As a young man, Romanes was a Christian, and some, including his religious wife, later said that he regained some of that belief during his final illness. In fact, he became an agnostic due to the influence of Darwin. In a manuscript left unfinished at the end of his life he said that the theory of evolution had caused him to abandon religion.

Romanes founded a series of free public lectures, the Romanes Lectures, which continue to this day. He was a friend of Thomas Henry Huxley, who gave the second Romanes lecture.

Towards the end of his life, he returned to Christianity.

He died in Oxford on 23 May 1894. A memorial to Romanes exists in the north west corner of Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh on the grave of his parents.

== Professional life ==
Romanes&#x27;s and Darwin&#x27;s relationship developed quickly and they became close friends. This relationship began when Romanes became Darwin&#x27;s research assistant during the last eight years of Darwin&#x27;s life. The association Romanes had with Darwin was essential in Darwin&#x27;s later works. Therefore, Darwin confided volumes of unpublished work which Romanes later used to publish papers. Like Darwin, Romanes&#x27;s theories were met with scepticism and were not accepted initially. The majority of Romanes&#x27;s work attempted to make a connection between animal consciousness and human consciousness. Some problems were encountered during his research that he addressed with the development of physiological selection. This was Romanes&#x27;s answer to three objections to Darwin&#x27;s isolation theory of speciation. These were: species characteristics that have no evolutionary purpose; the widespread fact of inter-specific sterility; and the need for varieties to escape the swamping effects of inter-crossing after permanent species are established. At the end of his career the majority of his work was directed towards the development of a relationship between intelligence and placement on an evolutionary tree. Romanes believed that the further along an organism was on an evolutionary standpoint, the more likely that organism would be to possess a higher level of functioning.

== Family ==
Romanes was the last child born of three children from George Romanes and Isabella Cair Smith. The majority of his immediate and extended family were descendant from Scottish Highland tribes. His father, Reverend George Romanes, was a professor at Queens College in Kingston, Canada and taught Greek at the local university until the family moved back to England. Romanes and his wife Ethel Duncan were married on 11 February 1879. They were happily married and studied together. Romanes was said to be an &quot;ideal father&quot; to their six children. Both Romanes&#x27; mother and father were involved in the Protestant and Anglican Church during his childhood. Romanes was baptised Anglican and was heavily involved with the Anglican teachings during his youth, despite the fact his parents were not heavily involved with any religion.

It is speculated that Darwin may have been viewed as a father figure to Romanes. Darwin did not agree with the teachings of the Catholic Church because the fundamental teachings were not supported by his scientific findings at the time. This could explain Romanes&#x27; conversion to agnosticism.

== Philosophical and political views ==
When Romanes attended Gonville and Caius College Cambridge, he entered into an essay contest on the topic of &quot;Christian Prayer considered in relation to the belief that Almighty governs the world by general laws&quot;. Romanes did not have much hope in winning, but much to his surprise he took first place in this contest and received the Burney prize. After winning the Burney prize, Romanes came to the conclusion that he could no longer be faithful to his Christian religion due to his love and commitment for science. This is interesting due to the fact that when Romanes was growing up, his father was a Reverend. Therefore, Romanes went into great detail about religion and how all aspects of the mind need to be involved to be faithfully committed to religion in his book &quot;Thoughts on Religion&quot;. He believed that one had to have an extremely high level of will to be dedicated to God or Christ. He had earlier published a book on the subject in general called &quot;A Candid Examination of Theism&quot;, where he concluded that God&#x27;s existence was not supported by the evidence, but stated his unhappiness with the fact.

==Romanes on evolution==
Romanes tackled the subject of evolution frequently. For the most part he supported Darwinism and the role of natural selection. However, he perceived three problems with Darwinian evolution:
#The difference between natural species and domesticated varieties in respect to fertility. [this problem was especially pertinent to Darwin, who used the analogy of change in domesticated animals so frequently]
# Structures which serve to distinguish allied species are often without any known utilitarian significance. [taxonomists choose the most visible and least changeable features to identify a species, but there may be a host of other differences which though not useful to the taxonomist are significant in survival terms]
# The swamping influence upon an incipient species-split of free inter-crossing. [Here we strike the problem which most perplexed Darwin, with his ideas of blending inheritance. It was solved by the rediscovery of Mendelian genetics, and the modern synthesis which showed that particulate inheritance could underlie continuous variation. Romanes also made the acute point that Darwin had not actually shown how natural selection produced species, despite the title of his famous book (&quot;On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection&quot;). Natural selection could be the &#x27;machine&#x27; for producing adaptation, but still in question was the mechanism for splitting species.

Romanes&#x27; own solution to this was called &#x27;physiological selection&#x27;. His idea was that variation in reproductive ability, caused mainly by the prevention of inter-crossing with parental forms, was the primary driving force in the production of new species. The majority view then (and now) was that geographical separation is the primary force in species splitting (or allopatry) and secondarily was the increased sterility of crosses between incipient species.

Taking influence from Darwin, Romanes was a proponent of both natural selection and the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The latter was denied by Alfred Russel Wallace, a strict selectionist. Romanes came into a dispute with Wallace over the definition of Darwinism.

== Published works ==
When Charles Darwin died, Romanes defended Darwin&#x27;s theories by attempting to rebut criticisms and attacks levied by other psychologists against the Darwinian school of thought. Romanes expanded on Darwin&#x27;s theories of evolution and natural selection by advancing a theory of behaviour based on comparative psychology. In &quot;Animal Intelligence,&quot; Romanes demonstrated similarities and dissimilarities between cognitive and physical functions of various animals. In &quot;Mental Evolution in Animals,&quot; Romanes illustrated the evolution of the cognitive and physical functions associated with animal life. Romanes believed that animal intelligence evolves through behavioural conditioning, or positive reinforcement. Romanes then published &quot;Mental Evolution in Man,&quot; which focused on the evolution of human cognitive and physical functions.

In 1890, Romanes published &quot;Darwin, and After Darwin,&quot; where he attempted to explain the relationship between science and religion. All of his notes on this subject were left to Charles Gore. Gore used the notes in preparing &quot;Thoughts on Religion,&quot; and published the work under Romanes&#x27; name. &quot;The Life and Letters of George Romanes&quot; offers a semi-autobiographical account of Romanes&#x27;s life.

<doc id="377113" wikidata="Q2645635" url="?curid=377113" title="Place names in Ireland">
<text>The vast majority of placenames in Ireland are anglicisations of Irish language names; that is, adaptations of the Irish names to English phonology and spelling. However, some names come directly from the English language, and a handful come from Old Norse and Scots. The study of placenames in Ireland unveils features of the country&#x27;s history and geography and the development of the Irish language. The name of Ireland itself comes from the Irish name &quot;Éire&quot;, added to the Germanic word &quot;land&quot;. In mythology, Éire was an Irish goddess of the land and of sovereignty (see Ériu).

In some cases, the official English or anglicised name is wholly different from the official Irish language name. An example is Dublin: its name is derived from the Irish (meaning &quot;black pool&quot;), but its Irish name is (meaning &quot;town of the hurdled ford&quot;).

==Etymology==

===Names of Irish Gaelic origin===
For most of the Gaelic period, there were very few towns or large settlements in Ireland. Hence, most places were named after noteworthy features of the landscape, such as hills, rocks, valleys, lakes, islands, and harbours. As time went on, more places were named after man-made features, such as churches, castles, and bridges. Some of the most common elements found in Irish placenames are shown in the table below. The differences in spelling are often due to differences in pronunciation.

===Names of Norse origin===
During the 800s and 900s, Vikings from Scandinavia raided monasteries along Ireland&#x27;s coasts and waterways. The Vikings spoke the Old Norse language and are also called Norsemen. They set up small coastal camps called longphorts – these were used as bases for their raiding parties and as shelters during the winter. Eventually, some longphorts grew into Norse settlements and trading ports. The biggest of these were Dublin (which became a Norse-Gaelic kingdom), Wexford, Waterford, Cork and Limerick. Over time, the Norsemen embraced Gaelic language and culture, becoming known as the Norse-Gaels (&quot;Gall-Ghaeil&quot; in Modern Irish, &quot;Gall-Gaidhel&quot; in Old Irish).

Placenames derived from Old Norse:
===Names of English origin===
After the Norman invasion of Ireland, which began in 1169, Anglo-Norman and English language placenames emerged in the areas under Anglo-Norman control. Most of these are within the bounds of &quot;The Pale&quot; – the area that stayed under direct English control for the longest, and where English language and culture held sway. It stretched along the east coast from Dundalk in the north to Dalkey in the south.

Between 1556 and 1641, during its &quot;conquest of Ireland&quot;, the English colonised parts of the country with settlers from Great Britain. This is known as the &quot;Plantations of Ireland&quot;. After the 1601 Battle of Kinsale defeat in which the Gaelic aristocracy fled to continental Europe the northern province of Ulster was the most heavily colonised. Those who settled as part of the &quot;Plantation of Ulster&quot; were required to be English speaking made up mostly of Lowland Scots and some northern English. The result is that northeast Ulster also has a great number of English-derived placenames.

Such placenames often refer to buildings and other manmade features. They often include forms such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, etc. However, forms such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; etc. are not uncommon.

Some placenames that seem to come from English are in fact anglicized Irish names modified by folk etymology. Examples include Longford (), Upperland (from &quot;Áth an Phoirt Leathain&quot; meaning &quot;ford of the broad (river) bank&quot;) and Forkhill (from &quot;Foirceal&quot; meaning &quot;trough&quot;).

===Names of Scots origin===

The Lowland Scots who settled during the Plantation of Ulster also contributed to place-names in the north of Ireland, particularly in the Ulster Scots areas. The Scots influence can be seen in places such as &quot;Burnside&quot; (stream), &quot;Calheme&quot; from &#x27;Cauldhame&#x27; (coldhome), &quot;Corby Knowe&quot; (raven knoll) &quot;Glarryford&quot; from &#x27;glaurie&#x27; (muddy), &quot;Gowks Hill&quot; (cuckoo) and &quot;Loanends&quot; (where the lanes end) in County Antrim, &quot;Crawtree&quot; (crow), &quot;Whaup Island&quot; (curlew) and &quot;Whinny Hill&quot; from &#x27;whin&#x27; (gorse) in County Down and the frequent elements &quot;burn&quot; (stream), &quot;brae&quot; (incline), &quot;dyke&quot; (a stone or turf wall), &quot;gate&quot; (a way or path), &quot;knowe&quot; (knoll), &quot;moss&quot; (moorland), &quot;sheuch&quot; or &quot;sheugh&quot; (a trench or ditch) and &quot;vennel&quot; (narrow alley). Other Scots elements may be obscured due to their being rendered in Standard English orthography.

===Names of other origins===
Some places in Ireland bear names from beyond Gaelic, Norse or English.

One reason for this is because foreign names can be perceived as more fashionable than native ones. Particularly in middle-class areas, names of Italian origin have been used because of this perception and many roads (e.g. &quot;Vico Road&quot; and &quot;Sorrento Road&quot; in Dalkey) and housing estates have obtained their names in this way. More rarely, this has led to the naming of whole suburbs (e.g. Montenotte and Tivoli in Cork). Portobello, Dublin was named in celebration of the British victory at the 1739 Battle of Porto Bello.

Another source of place names is from Anglo-Norman. Considering the number of surnames of Norman origin in Ireland, these are surprisingly rare. Nevertheless, some examples do exist, such as the town of Buttevant (from the motto of the Barry family – &quot;Boutez en Avant&quot;) and the village of Brittas (from the Norman-French &quot;Bretesche&quot;, &quot;boarding, planking&quot;). Others exist in portmanteau with words of Irish or English origin, such as Castletownroche, which combines the English &quot;Castletown&quot; and the French &quot;Roche&quot;, meaning rock. Most widespread is the term &quot;Pallas&quot; (from Norman &quot;paleis&quot;, &quot;boundary fence&quot;) which appears in over 20 place names, including the towns Pallasgreen and Pallaskenry. Reeves Castle and the townland of Reeves near Celbridge take their name from Anglo-Norman &quot;rive&quot;, meaning &quot;riverbank.&quot;

A further source of place names of other origin is places names after religious sites outside Ireland. Examples are Lourdes Road in Dublin and Pic du Jer Park in Cork.

The baronies of North Salt and South Salt are derived from &quot;Saltus Salmonis&quot;, a Latin calque of the town name of Leixlip (from Norse &quot;Lax Hlaup&quot;, &quot;salmon leap&quot;).

Some linguists, including Theo Vennemann, have proposed that the ancient name for Ireland &quot;Ivernia&quot; or &quot;Hibernia&quot; is derived from proto-Semitic &quot;*&#x27;i: weriju&quot; (&quot;island of copper&quot;).

==Republic of Ireland==

In the Republic of Ireland, both Irish and English names have equal status and are displayed on road signs, though the Irish is in smaller, italicised font, while the English is in all upper case. However, in the Gaeltacht, the English/anglicized names have no official status and do not appear on road signs.

During and after the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922, some English names were returned to their Irish form. In most cases, the Irish Gaelic name became the only official one (for example &quot;Kingstown&quot; became &quot;Dún Laoghaire&quot; in both languages). In other cases, the English name was changed for another (for example &quot;King&#x27;s County&quot; became &quot;County Offaly&quot;, which comes from the Irish &quot;Uíbh Fhailí&quot;). Although most of the changes were accepted by the wider public, some did not catch on and were eventually undone. The Local Government Act 1946 allowed locals to petition for a name change.

The following places were officially renamed:
*Bagenalstown → Muine Bheag (1932)
*Charleville → Ráth Luirc (1920s) → Charleville (1989)
*County Donegal → County Tirconaill (1922) → County Donegal (1927)
*Edgeworthstown → Mostrim (1935) → Edgeworthstown (1974)
*Kells → Ceannanus Mór (1929) → Kells (1993)
*King&#x27;s County → County Offaly (1922)
*Kingstown → Dún Laoghaire (1922)
*Kingwilliamstown → Ballydesmond (1951)
*Maryborough → Portlaoise (1929)
*Navan → An Uaimh (1922) → Navan (1971)
*Newbridge → Droichead Nua (1930s)
*Newtownbarry → Bunclody (1950)
*Newtownsandes → Moyvane (1939)
*Parsonstown → Birr (1890s)
*Philipstown → Daingean (1922)
*Queen&#x27;s County → County Laois (1922)
*Queenstown → Cobh (1922)

Pursuant to the Official Languages Act 2003 and the advice of the &quot;Coimisiún Logainmneacha&quot; (Place-Names Commission), the Placenames (Centres of Population and Districts) Order 2005 was issued, listing the equivalent in the Irish language of place-names specified in the Order with its English form. The Irish words then had the same meaning and same force and effect as the place-name. This order lists a little fewer than 2,000 place-names, many of which were changed from the Irish form used since independence, e.g. Bray went from &quot;Brí Chualann&quot; to &quot;Bré&quot; and Naas changed from &quot;Nás na Rí&quot; to &quot;An Nás&quot;.

Beyond the Gaeltacht, only English placenames were officially recognised (pre-2004). But further placenames orders have been passed to enable both the English and Irish placenames to be used. An example of present inconsistency is the village of Straffan, designated variously as , and . In the 1830s John O&#x27;Donovan listed it as &quot;Srufáin&quot;. The nearby village of Kilteel was &quot;Cill tSíle&quot; for centuries, meaning &quot;The church of Saint Síle&quot;, but since 2000 it has been shown as &quot;Cill Chéile&quot;, which does not carry the same meaning.

Vehicle registration plates of the Republic of Ireland are bilingual: the county of registration is shown in Irish above the plate number as a kind of surtitle, and is encoded from English within the plate number. For example, a Dublin plate is subtitled &quot;Baile Átha Cliath&quot; and the plate number includes D.

==Northern Ireland==

In Northern Ireland, the new recognition of the status of the Irish language does not extend to bilingual roadsigns – it is down to individual district councils to decide to place them. Some towns in Fermanagh and Omagh, Derry City and Strabane, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Moyle, Magherafelt, Newry, Mourne and Down and Cookstown council areas display bilingual names on some welcome signs (e.g. &quot;OMAGH&quot; &quot;An Ómaigh&quot;).

Irish-language street signs may be erected at the request of locals, provided there is enough support.

==Names of provinces==
There are four provinces in Ireland, three of which derive their English name from a mixture of their ancient Irish provincial name with the Old Norse term for land/territory/place; &quot;staðr&quot;.

*Connacht, sometimes anglicised as Connaught, is derived from the &quot;Connachta&quot; dynasty, which means &quot;the descendants of Conn&quot;. In modern Irish it is called &quot;Connachta&quot; or &quot;Cúige Chonnacht&quot;.
*Munster, derived from + Old Norse &quot;staðr&quot;, meaning &quot;land of Mumha&quot;. In modern Irish it is called &quot;an Mhumhain&quot; or &quot;Cúige Mumhan&quot;.
*Leinster, derived from + Old Norse &quot;staðr&quot;, meaning &quot;land of the Laighin&quot;. In modern Irish it is called &quot;Laighin&quot; or &quot;Cúige Laighean&quot;.
*Ulster, derived from + Old Norse &quot;staðr&quot;, meaning &quot;land of the Ulaidh&quot;. In modern Irish it is called &quot;Ulaidh&quot; or &quot;Cúige Uladh&quot;.

In Irish the provinces are known as &quot;cúigí&quot;, the singular of which is &quot;cúige&quot;. The word &quot;cúige&quot; originally meant &quot;a fifth&quot;, as in one-fifth part of Ireland. This is because Meath, as seat of the High King of Ireland, was once a province in its own right, incorporating modern counties Meath, Westmeath and parts of surrounding counties. Meath was later absorbed into Leinster.

==Names of counties==

In Irish, the counties are known as &quot;contaetha&quot;, the singular of which is &quot;contae&quot;. Irish versions of county names only have official status in the Republic of Ireland.

Most of the counties were named after a town in that county (commonly referred to as a county town); usually an administrative centre. Some of these towns, such as Louth, have declined into small villages or have lost their county town status to other towns.

Counties named after their present or former county towns: Antrim, Armagh, Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Down, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford, and Wicklow. The county of Londonderry is named after the city of the same name, though its county town was Coleraine until 1972 when counties were abolished as administrative units in Northern Ireland and replaced with unitary councils.

Some counties derive their names from ancient Irish túatha, kingdoms or people:
*Fermanagh, which is derived from &quot;Fear Manach&quot; meaning &quot;men of Manach&quot;.
*Kerry, which is derived from &quot;Ciarraí&quot;, which is itself derived from &quot;Ciarraighe&quot;, meaning &quot;people of Ciar&quot;.
*Laois, which is derived from &quot;Loígis&quot;, the name of a túath.
*Meath, which is derived from &quot;Mide&quot;, the name of a former province.
*Offaly, which is derived from &quot;Uí Failghe&quot;, the name of a túath.
*Tyrone, which is derived from &quot;Tír Eógain&quot; meaning &quot;Eógan&#x27;s land&quot;.
*Westmeath, which was formerly part of Meath until 1542, is likewise derived from &quot;Mide&quot;.

Some counties derive their names from geographic descriptions

In 1994, County Dublin was abolished as an administrative unit and replaced with three new administrative counties:
*Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, which is named after the town of &quot;Dún Laoghaire&quot; (meaning &quot;Laoghaire&#x27;s stronghold&quot;); and the former barony of Rathdown (&quot;Ráth an Dúin&quot; in Irish, meaning &quot;ringfort of the stronghold&quot;).
*Fingal, which is derived from the Irish &quot;Fine Gall&quot;, meaning &quot;foreign tribe&quot;, referring to the Norse who invaded and settled the area.
*South Dublin, which is named after Dublin.

==Names of streets and roads==
Many streets and roads in Ireland derive their name from that of the townland, settlement or parish it goes through or heads towards, many of which are of Irish origin. Other streets and roads derive their names from local buildings, manufacturies or people etc.

In Irish, a &quot;street&quot; is &quot;&quot;, a &quot;road&quot; is &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;cow path&quot;), a &quot;lane&quot; is &quot;lána&quot;, and an &quot;avenue&quot; is &quot;ascaill&quot;. A linear village is called a &quot;sráidbhaile&quot; (&quot;[one]-street settlement&quot;)—this has been anglicised as Stradbally, which is the name of a number of villages on the island. Whilst Irish forms only have official status in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland district councils are allowed to erect bilingual roadsigns.

Origins of some streets and roads in Belfast, Northern Ireland
* Antrim Road, takes its name from the settlement it leads to, Antrim town.
* Ballymurphy Road, derives its name from the townland of Ballymurphy, which itself is derived from the , meaning &quot;homestead of O&#x27;Murphy&quot;.
* Crumlin Road takes its name from the settlement the road leads to, Crumlin.
* Donegall Square and Donegall Pass, both named after Lord Donegall, who opened six wide avenues also known as passes.
* Falls Road was originally called the Pound, however, it derives its present name from an older Irish name &quot;Tuath-na-bhfal&quot;, meaning &quot;district of the falls&quot; or &quot;hedges&quot;.
* Hercules Street is named after Sir Hercules Langford.
* Mountpottinger and Pottinger&#x27;s Lane both derive from the famous Pottinger family.
* Mustard Street is named after a mustard works.
* Old Forge and New Forge both derive their names from forges for smelting iron.
* Shankill Road derives its name from meaning &quot;old church&quot;, which is also the name of the local parish.

Origins of some streets and roads in Dublin, Republic of Ireland
* O&#x27;Connell Street, formerly known as Sackville Street, it was renamed after Daniel O&#x27;Connell. Its Irish name is &quot;Sráid Uí Chonaill&quot;.
* Grafton Street, developed by the Dawson family, it is named after the Earls of Grafton who owned land in the area. Its Irish name is &quot;Sráid Grafton&quot;.
* Pearse Street, originally called Moss Lane, then Great Brunswick Street, it was renamed after Pádraig Pearse. Its Irish name is &quot;Sráid an Phiarsaigh&quot;
* St. James&#x27;s Street takes its name from a Holy Well in the vicinity, dedicated to St James.

<text>A budget is a calculation plan, usually but not always financial, for a defined period, often one year or a month. A budget may include anticipated sales volumes and revenues, resource quantities including time, costs and expenses, environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions, other impacts, assets, liabilities and cash flows. Companies, governments, families, and other organizations use budgets to express strategic plans of activities in measurable terms.

Preparing a budget allows companies, authorities, private entities or families to establish priorities and evaluate the achievement of their objectives. To achieve these goals it may be necessary to incur a deficit (expenses exceed income) or, on the contrary, it may be possible to save, in which case the budget will present a surplus (income exceed expenses).

In the field of commerce, a budget is also a financial document or report that details the cost that a service will have if performed. Whoever makes the budget must adhere to it and cannot change it if the client accepts the service.

A budget expresses intended expenditures along with proposals for how to meet them with resources. A budget may express a surplus, providing resources for use at a future time, or a deficit in which expenditures exceed income or other resources.
==Government==

The budget of a government is a summary or plan of the anticipated resources (often but not always from taxes) and expenditures of that government. There are three types of government budgets: the operating or current budget, the capital or investment budget, and the cash or cash flow budget.

===By country===

====United States====

The federal budget is prepared by the Office of Management and Budget, and submitted to Congress for consideration. Invariably, Congress makes many and substantial changes. Nearly all American states are required to have balanced budgets, but the federal government is allowed to run deficits.

====India====

The budget is prepared by the Budget Division Department of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Finance annually. The Finance Minister is the head of the budget making committee. The present Indian Finance minister is Nirmala Sitharaman. The Budget includes supplementary excess grants and when a proclamation by the President as to failure of Constitutional machinery is in operation in relation to a State or a Union Territory, preparation of the Budget of such State.
The first budget of India was submitted on 18 February 1860 by James Wilson. 
P C Mahalanobis is known as the father of Indian budget.

====Philippines====
The Philippine budget is considered the most complicated in the world, incorporating multiple approaches in one single budget system: line-item (budget execution), performance (budget accountability), and zero-based budgeting. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) prepares the National Expenditure Program and forwards it to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives to come up with a General Appropriations Bill (GAB). The GAB will go through budget deliberations and voting; the same process occurs when the GAB is transmitted to the Philippine Senate.

After both houses of Congress approves the GAB, the President signs the bill into a General Appropriations Act (GAA); also, the President may opt to veto the GAB and have it returned to the legislative branch or leave the bill unsigned for 30 days and lapse into law. There are two types of budget bill veto: the line-item veto and the veto of the whole budget.

==Personal ==

A personal budget or home budget is a finance plan that allocates future personal income towards expenses, savings and debt repayment. Past spending and personal debt are considered when creating a personal budget. There are several methods and tools available for creating, using, and adjusting a personal budget. For example, jobs are an income source, while bills and rent payments are expenses. A third category (other than income and expenses) may be assets (such as property, investments, or other savings or value) representing a potential reserve for funds in case of budget shortfalls.

==Corporate budget ==

The budget of a business, division, or corporation


is a financial forecast for the near-term future, usually the next accounting period, aggregating the expected revenues and expenses of the various departments – operations, human resources, IT, etc.
It is thus a key element in integrated business planning, with measurable targets correspondingly devolved to departmental managers (and becoming KPIs);
budgets may then also specify non-cash resources, such as staff or time.

The budgeting process requires considerable effort,
often involving dozens of staff; 
final sign-off resides with both the financial director and operations director.
The responsibility usually sits within the company&#x27;s financial management area in general, sometimes, specifically in &quot;FP&amp;A&quot;.
Professionals employed in this role are often designated &quot;Budget Analyst&quot;, 
a specialized financial analyst function. 

Organisations may produce functional budgets, relating to activities, and / or cash budgets, focused on receipts and payments.
Incremental budgeting starts with the budget from the previous period, while under zero-based budgeting activities/costs are included only if justified.
Under all approaches expected sales or revenue, is typically the starting point; this will be based on the business&#x27; planning for the period in question. 
Directly related elements and costs are typically linked to these (activity based costing may be employed).
Support and management functions may be revisited, and the resultant &quot;fixed&quot; costs, such as rent and payroll, will be adjusted, at a minimum, for inflation. 
Capital expenditure, both new investments and maintenance, may be budgeted separately;
debt servicing and repayments likewise.
The master budget aggregates these all.
See Financial forecast, Cash flow forecast, .

Whereas the budget is typically compiled on an annual basis 
- although, e.g. in mining,
this may be quarterly - 
the monitoring is ongoing, with financial and operational adjustments (or interventions) made as warranted; see for further discussion.
Here, if the actual figures delivered come close to those budgeted, this suggests that managers understand their business and have been successful in delivering. 
On the other hand, if the figures diverge this sends an &quot;out of control&quot; signal; 
additionally, the share price could suffer where these figures have been communicated to analysts.

Criticism is sometimes directed at the nature of budgeting, and its impact on the organization.

Additional to the cost in time and resources, two phenomena are identified as problematic: 
First, it is suggested that managers will often &quot;game the system&quot; in specifying targets that are easily attainable, and / or in asking for more resources than required, such that the required resources will be budgeted as a compromise.
A second observation is that managers&#x27; thinking may emphasize short term, operational thinking at the expense of a long term and strategic perspective, particularly when bonus payments are linked to budget.

==Types of budgets==
* Sales budget – an estimate of future sales, often broken down into both units. It is used to create company and sales goals.
* Production budget – an estimate of the number of units that must be manufactured to meet the sales goals. The production budget also estimates the various costs involved with manufacturing those units, including labor and material. Created by product oriented companies.
* Capital budget – used to determine whether an organization&#x27;s long-term investments such as new machinery, replacement machinery, new plants, new products, and research development projects are worth pursuing.
* Cash flow/cash budget – a prediction of future cash receipts and expenditures for a particular time period. It usually covers a period in the short-term future. The cash flow budget helps the business to determine when income will be sufficient to cover expenses and when the company will need to seek outside financing.
* Conditional budgeting is a budgeting approach designed for companies with fluctuating income, high fixed costs, or income depending on sunk costs, as well as NPOs and NGOs. 
* Marketing budget – an estimate of the funds needed for promotion, advertising, and public relations in order to market the product or service.
* Project budget – a prediction of the costs associated with a particular company project. These costs include labour, materials, and other related expenses. The project budget is often broken down into specific tasks, with task budgets assigned to each. A cost estimate is used to establish a project budget.
* Revenue budget – consists of revenue receipts of government and the expenditure met from these revenues. Revenues are made up of taxes and other duties that the government levies. Various countries and unions have created four types of tax jurisdictions: interstate, state, local and tax jurisdictions with a special status (Free-trade zones). Each of them provides a money flow to the corresponding revenue budget levels.
* Expenditure budget – includes spending data items.
* Flexibility budget – it is established for fixed cost and variable rate is determined per activity measure for variable cost.
* Appropriation budget – a maximum amount is established for certain expenditure based on management judgement.
*Performance budget – it is mostly used by organization and ministries involved in the development activities. This process of budget takes into account the end results.
* Zero based budget – A budget type where every item added to the budget needs approval and no items are carried forward from the prior years budget. This type of budget has a clear advantage when the limited resources are to be allocated carefully and objectively. Zero based budgeting takes more time to create as all pieces of the budget need to be reviewed by management.
*Personal budget – A budget type focusing on expenses for self or for home, usually involves an income to budget.

<doc id="377123" wikidata="Q4899357" url="?curid=377123" title="Beveled glass">
<text>Beveled glass is usually made by taking thick glass and creating an angled surface cut (bevel) around the entire periphery. Bevels act as prisms in sunlight creating an interesting color refraction which both highlights the glass work and provides a spectrum of colors which would ordinarily be absent in clear float glass.

Beveled glass can be obtained as clusters which are arranged to create a specific design. These can vary from simple three or four piece designs, often used in top lights (commonly known as transoms) of windows and conservatories, to more complex combinations of many pieces, suitable for larger panels such as doors and side screens (known in the door industry as sidelites).

Beveled glass has also been used with clear and colored textured glass to create designs. Textured glass is typically thick and has a distinct visible texture. Beveled glass is typical made from float plate glass but thicknesses up to have been used for larger windows. The width of the bevel also can vary depending on the desired effect. The combination of beveled glass is juxtaposed to the textured glass creating dramatic visual effects.

Beveling was traditionally done manually by grinding and polishing operations:
Modern beveled glass is machine made. The automation of this traditionally hand made craft was facilitated by the development of plastic based metal deburring wheels which provided adequate smoothing of the ground glass face without the difficulties involved with traditional aluminum oxide and natural sandstone smoothing stones. The best natural smoothing stones came from a quarry in Newcastle, England and would be round wheels with a central hole several feet in diameter and thick. The stone&#x27;s quality was dictated by the consistency of the sandstone, as any imperfection would scratch the glass being smoothed. These large stones would smooth the rough scratches created by the grinding process. The type of grinding and smoothing equipment depended upon whether one was creating straight line, outside or inside curved bevels. Outside curves and straight lines are ground on a flat rotating platter covered in a thin slurry of silicon carbide and water. Inside curves were ground on a silicon carbide grinding wheel of appropriate grit with water running on the wheel. Smoothing the ground face was done using the Newcastle stone for outside curves and straight line bevels and a cone shaped polishing wheel of relatively fine grit aluminum oxide.

Despite the advantages of the plastic smoothing wheels, the crispness of the bevel edge is superior on the stone smoothed traditionally beveled pieces and can distinguish hand made beveled glass. The final step was polishing the beveled face using a felt covered wheel with a slurry of water and optical polishing powder. It was not uncommon to have pieces with a combination of outside and inside curve as well as straight line bevels. The objective was to have an even bevel width, even edge thickness with no facets in the bevel face and a crisp bevel edge.

In the early 1900s in USA it was not uncommon to see beveled oval door glass in length with wide bevels on thick plate glass. Creating such bevels required two craftsmen working as a team.

<doc id="377142" wikidata="Q241132" url="?curid=377142" title="Corinna">
<text>Corinna or Korinna () was an ancient Greek lyric poet from Tanagra in Boeotia. Although ancient sources portray her as a contemporary of Pindar (born ), not all modern scholars accept the accuracy of this tradition. When she lived has been the subject of much debate since the early twentieth century, proposed dates ranging from the beginning of the fifth century to the late third century BC.

Corinna&#x27;s works survive only in fragments: three substantial sections of poems are preserved on second-century AD papyri from Egypt; several shorter pieces survive in quotations by ancient grammarians. They focus on local Boeotian legends, and are distinctive for their mythological innovations. Corinna&#x27;s poetry often reworks well-known myths to include details not known from any other sources. Though respected in her hometown, Tanagra, and popular in ancient Rome, modern critics have often regarded her as parochial and dull; her poetry is nonetheless of interest as she is one of the few female poets from ancient Greece whose work survives.

==Life==
Corinna was from Tanagra in Boeotia. The &quot;Suda&quot;, a tenth-century encyclopedia, records that she was the daughter of Acheloodorus and Procratia, and was nicknamed Myia (Μυῖα, &quot;the fly&quot;). According to ancient tradition, she lived during the fifth century BC. She was supposed to have been a contemporary of Pindar, either having taught him, or been a fellow-pupil of Myrtis of Anthedon with him. Corinna was said to have competed with Pindar, defeating him in at least one poetry competition, though some sources claim five.

Since the early twentieth century, scholars have been divided over the accuracy of the traditional chronology of Corinna&#x27;s life. One of the first scholars to question this was Edgar Lobel, who in 1930 concluded that there is no reason to believe she predated the orthography used on the Berlin papyrus, on which fragments of two of her poems are preserved. The debate over Corinna&#x27;s date has dominated scholarship since, and the evidence remains inconclusive. Sceptics of the traditional chronology argue that there is no ancient mention of Corinna before the first century BC, and that the orthography of her surviving poetry was not established until after the mid-fourth century. This is the most common view, with Martin Litchfield West and David A. Campbell among those who believe a late date for Corinna. Campbell concludes that a third-century date is &quot;almost certain&quot;.

The alternative view, accepting the traditional fifth-century date, is set forth by scholars such as Archibald Allen and Jiří Frel. If the traditional date is correct, the lack of ancient reference to Corinna before the first century, and the later orthography, could both be explained by her being of only local interest before the Hellenistic period. According to this theory, when she was rediscovered and popularised in the Hellenistic period her poetry would have been re-spelled into contemporary Boeotian orthography, as her original fifth-century orthography was too unfamiliar to a third-century audience. An apparent &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; is established by the second-century AD theologian Tatian, who says in his &quot;Address to the Greeks&quot; that the fourth-century sculptor Silanion made a portrait-statue of Corinna. A Roman-era copy of a fourth-century statue in the Musée Vivenel in Compiègne, France, is identified by an inscription on the base as depicting Corinna, and is widely accepted by archeologists as a copy of Silanion&#x27;s sculpture. Philologists continue to regard this attribution with what Thea S. Thorsen describes as &quot;unwarranted scepticism&quot;. West, for instance, accepts that the Compiègne statuette is a copy of a fourth-century work, but suggests that it was not originally intended to depict Corinna, only gaining that association in the Roman period. Thorsen argues that the sculpture was always intended as an image of Corinna, noting that the figure is shown with five scrolls that match the five books of poetry attributed to Corinna in antiquity.

==Poetry==
Corinna, like Pindar, wrote choral lyric poetryas demonstrated by her invocation of Terpsichore, the Muse of dance and chorus, in one of her fragments. According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, she wrote five books of poetry. Her works were collected in a Boeotian edition in the late third or early second century BC, and later Hellenistic and Roman texts of Corinna derived from this. This Boeotian edition was produced in a scholarly format, with titles for the poems; it may have also included accent marks and hypotheses, but is unlikely to have included line numbers.

Corinna wrote in a literary dialect, which had features of her Boeotian vernacular, along with similarities to the language of epic both in morphology and in her choice of words; Daniel Berman describes it as &quot;epic written as Boeotian&quot;. If Corinna was a contemporary of Pindar, this use of the local vernacular as a literary language is archaicthough the earlier poets Alcman and Stesichorus wrote in literary dialects based on their own vernaculars, the fifth-century choral poets Pindar and Bacchylides both wrote in Doric despite it not being their local dialect. On the other hand, if she is to be located closer to the Hellenistic period, parallels can be found in the poetry of Theocritus, who also used features of his native dialect in the &quot;Idylls&quot;.

===Poems===
About forty fragments of Corinna&#x27;s poetry survive, more than any ancient woman poet except for Sappho, though no complete poems of hers are known. The three most substantial fragments are preserved on pieces of papyrus discovered in Hermopolis and Oxyrhynchus in Egypt, dating to the second century AD; many of the shorter fragments survive in citations by grammarians interested in Corinna&#x27;s Boeotian dialect.

Two fragments of Corinna&#x27;s poetry are preserved on the same papyrus (P.Berol. 13284), now in the collection of the Berlin State Museums. The first of these tells the story of a singing contest between the mountains Cithaeron and Helicon. The surviving portion includes the ending of one of the mountain&#x27;s songs, the gods voting on the winner of the contest, and the losing mountain, Helicon, throwing down a boulder in anger. The second poem preserved on this papyrus tells of the daughters of the river-god Asopus. It mostly consists of a prophet, Acraephen, telling Asopus how his daughters were abducted by the gods, and that they will go on to give birth to many heroes; the papyrus ends with a highly fragmentary portion in which Asopus appears to be reconciled to his daughters&#x27; fate, and he responds &quot;happily&quot;. The third substantial fragment of Corinna&#x27;s poetry, preserved on a papyrus in the Sackler Library of the University of Oxford (P.Oxy. 2370), invokes the muse of dance and choral poetry, Terpsichore. It is usually thought to be from a &quot;partheneion&quot;, a kind of poem performed by a chorus of young women for a public occasion. West suggests that it was written as an introductory poem for Corinna&#x27;s collection.

===Style===
Corinna&#x27;s language is clear, simple, and generally undecorated, and she tends to use simple metrical schemes. Her poetry focuses more on the narrative than on intricate use of language. Her use of lyric poetry to tell mythic narratives is similar to that of Stesichorus. Corinna&#x27;s poetry is often ironic or humorous in tone, in contrast with the serious tone of her Boeotian compatriot Pindar.

Corinna&#x27;s poetry is almost entirely concerned with myth. According to a story recounted by Plutarch in &quot;On the Glory of the Athenians&quot;, she considered myth the proper subject for poetry, rebuking Pindar for not paying sufficient attention to it. Pindar was said to have responded to this criticism by filling his next ode with mythical allusions, leading Corinna to advise him, &quot;Sow with the hand, not with the sack.&quot; Corinna&#x27;s poetry concentrates on local legends, with poems about Orion, Oedipus, and the Seven against Thebes. Her &quot;Orestes&quot; is possibly an exception to her focus on Boeotian legends. Her poetry often reworks mythological traditionaccording to Derek Collins, &quot;the most distinctive feature of Corinna&#x27;s poetry is her mythological innovation&quot;frequently including details which are otherwise unknown. These reworkings often present gods and heroes in a more positive light than in more common versions of the myths.

Two of Corinna&#x27;s most substantial fragments, the &quot;Daughters of Asopus&quot; and &quot;Terpsichore&quot; poems, demonstrate a strong interest in genealogy. This genealogical focus is reminiscent of the works of Hesiod, especially the &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, though other lost genealogical poetry is known from the archaic periodfor instance by Asius of Samos and Eumelus of Corinth. The third major surviving fragment of Corinna&#x27;s poetry, on the contest between Mount Cithaeron and Mount Helicon, seems also to have been influenced by Hesiod, who also wrote an account of this myth.

Marilyn B. Skinner argues that Corinna&#x27;s poetry is part of the tradition of &quot;women&#x27;s poetry&quot; in ancient Greece, though it differs significantly from Sappho&#x27;s conception of that genre. She considers that although it was written by a woman, Corinna&#x27;s poetry tells stories from a patriarchal point of view, describing women&#x27;s lives from a masculine perspective. Anne Klinck suggests that &quot;a certain feminine irony is detectable&quot; in Corinna&#x27;s works, and John Heath argues that in the &quot;Terpsichore&quot; poem Corinna deliberately emphasises her position as a woman poet. Diane Rayor argues that although Corinna&#x27;s poetry does not directly challenge patriarchal traditions, it is still &quot;woman-identified&quot;, focusing on women&#x27;s experiences and being written for a female audience.

===Performance context===
The circumstances in which Corinna&#x27;s poetry was performed are uncertain, and have been the subject of much scholarly debate. At least some of her poetry was probably performed for a mixed-gender audience, though some may have been intended for a specifically female audience. Skinner suggests that Corinna&#x27;s songs were composed for performance by a chorus of young girls in religious festivals, and were related to the ancient genre of &quot;partheneia&quot;. The poems may have been performed at cult celebrations in the places which appear in her poetry. Possible settings include the Mouseia at Thespiae, proposed by West, and at the festival of the Daedala at Plataea, suggested by Gabriele Burzacchini.

==Reception==
Corinna was well-regarded by the people of ancient Tanagra, her hometown. Pausanias reports that there was a monument to her in the streets of the townprobably a statueand a painting of her in the gymnasium. Tatian writes in his &quot;Address to the Greeks&quot; that Silanion had sculpted her. In the early Roman Empire, Corinna&#x27;s poetry was popular. The earliest mention of Corinna is by the first-century BC poet Antipater of Thessalonica, who includes her in his selection of nine &quot;mortal muses&quot;. Ovid gives his lover the pseudonym Corinna in his &quot;Amores&quot;, often believed to be a reference to the Tanagran poet. She is also named by Propertius as a model for Cynthia, and by Statius along with Callimachus, Lycophron, and Sophron. Alexander Polyhistor wrote a commentary on her work, and she was named as a tenth canonical lyric poet in a scholion on Dionysius Thrax.

From the early modern period, the example of ancient Greek women writers has been used to legitimise the writing of modern women; Corinna has been invoked in this way by Gaspara Stampa and Madeleine de Scudéry. In the nineteenth century, Corinna was still remembered as a poetic authority, Karl Otfried Müller presenting her as a preeminent ancient poet and citing the stories of her competition against Pindar. Modern critics have tended to dismiss Corinna&#x27;s work, considering it dull. For instance, West describes Corinna as more gifted than most local poets, but lacking the originality that would put her on the same level as Bacchylides or Pindar. Athanassios Vergados argues that Corinna&#x27;s poor reception among modern critics is due to her focus on local Boeotian traditions rather than broader subject matter, giving her a reputation of parochialism and thus limited quality. More recently, critics have begun to see Corinna&#x27;s poetry as engaging with Panhellenic mythical and literary traditions, rewriting them to give Boeotian characters a more prominent role. Corinna&#x27;s work has also been of interest to feminist literary historians as one of the few extant examples of ancient Greek women&#x27;s poetry.

<text>The Chevrolet Astro is a minivan that was manufactured and marketed by the Chevrolet division of American auto manufacturer General Motors from 1985 to 2005. Sold alongside the GMC Safari, the Astro was marketed in multiple configurations, including passenger van and cargo van.

The Astro and Safari used a rear-wheel-drive chassis; all-wheel drive became an option in 1990. For its entire production, the Astro and Safari were produced by Baltimore Assembly in Baltimore, Maryland; the vans would be the final model line produced by the facility. In total, approximately 3.2 million Astros and Safaris were produced from 1985 through 2005.

==Background==
The Astro and Safari were introduced for the 1985 model year as the first minivan from General Motors. While marketed as a response to the first-generation Chrysler minivans, GM selected a rear-wheel drive layout, sizing the Astro and Safari closely to the short-wheelbase Chevrolet G10 van. Similar to the Ford Aerostar, to reduce production costs, GM adapted light-truck powertrain components; engines and transmissions were sourced from the Chevrolet S-10, allowing for a towing capacity of up to .

Prior to its use on a minivan, the Astro nameplate was used twice by General Motors; in 1967 (for the Chevrolet Astro 1 concept car) and from 1969 until 1987 (on the GMC Astro COE semitractor). GMC sourced the Safari nameplate from Pontiac (used by the latter to denote station wagons). As GMC was half of the Pontiac/GMC Division (later including Buick), from 1985 through 1989, both GMC and Pontiac Safaris were simultaneously offered through the same dealership network.

==First generation (1985–1994)==
Initial advertising boasted that it was a vehicle that will &quot;make you realize that life is too big for a minivan,&quot; referring to the Chrysler minivans. The van can have a seating configuration between two and eight passengers.

Engine choices ranged from a 2.5L four-cylinder to a 4.3L V6, depending on options and model year. The 4-cylinder engine was only offered in short-length, rear-wheel-drive cargo vans, as well as passenger vans for 1985 only; it was dropped after 1990. For 1985, the 4.3L V6 (RPO LB1) used a 4-barrel carburetor. For 1986, throttle body fuel injection (TBI) was used. For 1992 and later years, a central port injection was used.

Much like the second-generation F-body 1970–1981 and X-body vehicles, the Astro/Safari (internally designated as the M-body for RWD models or L-body for AWD models) had a bolt-on subframe. For the M-van, the front suspension shared most components with the GM B-body station wagon (Chevrolet Caprice, Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser and larger variants of the Pontiac Safari and Buick Estate Wagon) with a leaf-spring rear suspension. The lower ball joints were larger than their B-body counterparts (similar to the 1977–96 Cadillac D platform vehicles; e.g., Fleetwood limousines). These ball joints were later used in the final Chevrolet Caprice 9C1 (police package) cars manufactured in 1995 and 1996. They also shared many mechanical similarities to the GMT 325/330 mid-size S/T pickups and utility vehicles.

Digital dashboards were offered in the first-generation Astro; this option did not continue after 1995.

1989 was the final year that the BorgWarner T-5 manual transmission was made available. All subsequent models were equipped with 700R4/4L60 automatic transmissions through 1993.
In 1990, a new all-wheel drive (AWD) system (the first U.S.-built minivan to do so), designed and developed by FF Developments (FFD), was made optional. The AWD models had a lower fuel economy: 17 miles per gallon on the highway versus 20 to 21 miles per gallon for rear-wheel-drive vans. AWD Astros used a BorgWarner 4472 transfer case.

The 1990 model year also introduced a new analog dashboard and the braking system, a system using the same accessory belt-driven pump to supply the power steering and brakes. In mid-1990, an extended body option, sharing its wheelbase with the shorter version, also became available.

In 1992, a new optional door form was introduced, colloquially known as Dutch doors. This form was two bi-parting doors with a flip-up window above. Previously, Astro and Safari vans were equipped only with bi-parting doors. An optional 4.3L V6 (RPO L35) engine with central port injection and a balance shaft was phased in.

In 1993, the electronically-controlled 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive became standard as the sole transmission offering. As with many other 1993 model year GM vehicles, Scotchgard fabric protection also became a standard feature on Astro vans equipped with cloth seats. 1994 saw the addition of three new exterior paint colors. These colors were Indigo Blue Metallic (#39), Light Quasar Blue Metallic (#20), and Medium Quasar Blue Metallic (#80). The Astro and Safari also received center high mount stop lamps for 1994, which had been mandated on light trucks for the model year.

==Second generation (1995–2005)==
For 1995, the model was facelifted with an extended nose that resembled the then-new full-size Express vans; while the original rectangular sealed-beam headlights were retained for use on lower trim levels, higher-spec models now used horizontally-mounted rectangular headlights that had debuted on the full-size trucks in 1988, and would eventually appear on the smaller trucks in 1998. Also for 1995, the short-length body was dropped. In 1996, a redesigned dash received a passenger-side airbag. The vans remained mostly unchanged until the end of production in 2005.

For 2003, GM upgraded the chassis of both the Astro and Safari with certain suspension components, four-wheel disc brakes, and six-lug 16-inch wheels from the full-size Chevrolet and GMC half-ton pickup trucks.

Production in 1998 totaled 32,736 units. However, sales from that point were decreasing and the second-shift production was eliminated in the summer of 2000. Sales of the Astro totaled only 15,709 in 2003, down about 16% from 2002. By 2004, sales of the Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari vans were in a downward trend, and the cost of upgrading the vans to meet new 2005 safety standards was too high. As a result, production at the Baltimore facility was stopped, with the last example rolling off the assembly line on May 13, 2005. 

=== Safety and crash testing ===
For the 1995 model year, GM started manufacturing most of its vehicles, including the Astro and Safari, with CFC-free air conditioning systems, which used R134a refrigerant instead of R-12 refrigerant.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), gave the Astro a &quot;Poor&quot; rating in 1996 because of a display of structural failure in the institute&#x27;s crash test into a fixed, offset barrier. The underbody of the test van buckled, pitching both front seats forward and shoving the crash dummy into the dashboard and steering wheel, resulting in a broken left leg, leading the institute to comment that &quot;[t]he collapse of the occupant compartment left little survival space for the driver.&quot;

In testing performed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), however, the Astro and Safari fared better, improving from a single-star rating in 1991 to a three-star (driver) and four-star (passenger) rating by 2000. In side impacts, the Astro and Safari both received the highest, five-star rating in every year that the test was administered.

In 2007, the IIHS reported that the 2001–2004 model year Chevrolet Astro recorded during calendar years 2002–2005 the fewest killed drivers of all passenger vehicles in the United States, as calculated per every million units on the road. Drivers&#x27; habits and vehicle usage might have influenced this result.

<text>The United States budget process is the framework used by Congress and the President of the United States to formulate and create the United States federal budget. The process was established by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, and additional budget legislation.

Prior to 1974, Congress had no formal process for establishing a federal budget. When President Richard Nixon began to refuse to spend funds that Congress had allocated, they adopted a more formal means by which to challenge him. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 created the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which gained more control of the budget, limiting the power of the President&#x27;s Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Act passed easily while the administration was embroiled in the Watergate scandal and was unwilling to provoke Congress.

== Discretionary spending ==

Discretionary spending requires an annual appropriation bill, which is a piece of legislation. Discretionary spending is typically set by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees and their various subcommittees. Since the spending is typically for a fixed period (usually a year), it is said to be under the &quot;discretion&quot; of the Congress. Some appropriations last for more than one year (see Appropriation bill for details). In particular, multi-year appropriations are often used for housing programs and military procurement programs.

As of 2019, there are 12 appropriations bills which need to be passed each fiscal year in order for continued discretionary spending to occur. The subject of each appropriations bill corresponds to the jurisdiction of the respective House and Senate appropriation subcommittees:
Multiple bills are sometimes combined into one piece of legislation, such as the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009. A continuing resolution is often passed if an appropriations bill has not been signed into law by the end of the fiscal year.

=== Authorization bills ===

In general, funds for federal government programs must be authorized by an &quot;authorizing committee&quot; through enactment of legislation. Then, through subsequent acts by Congress, budget authority is appropriated by the Appropriations Committee of the House. In principle, committees with jurisdiction to authorize programs make policy decisions, while the Appropriations Committees decide on funding levels, limited to a program&#x27;s authorized funding level, though the amount may be any amount less than the limit. But it all starts with the president&#x27;s budget.

=== Annual process ===

====Presidential budget request====
The United States budget process begins when the President of the United States submits a budget request to Congress. The President&#x27;s budget is formulated over a period of months with the assistance of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the largest office within the Executive Office of the President. The budget request includes funding requests for all federal executive departments and independent agencies. Budget documents include supporting documents and historical budget data and contains detailed information on spending and revenue proposals, along with policy proposals and initiatives with significant budgetary implications. The President&#x27;s budget request constitutes an extensive proposal of the administration&#x27;s intended revenue and spending plans for the following fiscal year. The budget proposal includes volumes of supporting information intended to persuade Congress of the necessity and value of the budget provisions. In addition, each federal executive department and independent agency provides additional detail and supporting documentation on its own funding requests. The documents are also posted on the OMB website.

The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 requires the President to submit the budget to Congress for each fiscal year, which is the 12-month period beginning on October 1 and ending on September 30 of the next calendar year. The current federal budget law ((a)) requires that the President submit the budget between the first Monday in January and the first Monday in February. In recent times, the President&#x27;s budget has been submitted in the first week of February. The budget submission has been delayed, however, in some new presidents&#x27; first year when the previous president belonged to a different party. The 2014 United States federal budget was not submitted by the President until April 10, 2013 due to negotiations over the United States fiscal cliff and implementation of the sequester cuts mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the House had already prepared its budget proposal on March 21, and the Senate proposed a budget on March 23).

President Warren G. Harding brought about the enactment of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, which, for the first time, required the President to submit a budget annually to Congress and which established the Bureau of the Budget, the forerunner of the Office of Management and Budget, to assist in the formulation of the budget. Initially the Bureau was within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, but in 1939 it was moved to the Executive Office of the President.

====Budget resolution====
The budget resolution is in the form of a concurrent resolution passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate but is not presented to the President and does not have the force of law. It sets out the congressional budget. The budget resolution establishes various budget totals, allocations, entitlements, and may include reconciliation instructions to designated House or Senate committees. A particularity of the budget (and reconciliation) process is that members of Congress may offer unlimited amendments to budget resolutions, which are normally quickly disposed of at the end of the statutory 50 hours of debate in a so-called &quot;vote-a-rama&quot;.

The President&#x27;s budget submission is referred to the House and Senate Budget Committees and to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Other committees with budgetary responsibilities submit requests and estimates to the budget committees during this time.

In March, the CBO publishes an analysis of the President&#x27;s proposals. The CBO budget report and other publications are also posted on the CBO website. CBO computes a current-law baseline budget projection that is intended to estimate what federal spending and revenues would be in the absence of new legislation for the current fiscal year and for the coming 10 fiscal years. However, the CBO also computes a current-policy baseline, which makes assumptions about, for instance, votes on tax cut sunset provisions. The current CBO 10-year budget baseline projection grows from $4.1 trillion in 2018 to $7.0 trillion in 2028.

In March, the budget committees consider the President&#x27;s budget proposals in the light of the CBO budget report, and each committee submits a budget resolution to its house by April 1. The House and Senate each consider these budget resolutions, and are expected to pass them, possibly with amendments, by April 15. A budget resolution is a kind of concurrent resolution; it is not a law, and therefore does not require the President&#x27;s signature.

There is no obligation for either or both houses of Congress to pass a budget resolution. There may not be a resolution every year; if none is established, the previous year&#x27;s resolution remains in force. For example, the Senate had not passed a budget resolution for FY2011, FY2012, or FY2013, but did pass the FY2014 budget resolution on March 23, 2013, 23 days before the April 15 deadline set by the No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013. This was the first budget resolution passed by the Senate since a FY2010 budget passed on April 29, 2009. The House and Senate may propose a budget independently of the President&#x27;s budget. For example, for the 2014 budget process, the House prepared its budget proposal on March 21, and the Senate proposed a budget on March 23, while the President&#x27;s budget was not submitted until April 10.

After both houses pass a budget resolution, selected Representatives and Senators negotiate a conference report to reconcile differences between the House and the Senate versions. The conference report, in order to become binding, must be approved by both the House and Senate. The budget resolution serves as a blueprint for the actual appropriation process and provides Congress with some control over the appropriation process. All new discretionary spending requires authority through enactment of appropriation bills or continuing resolutions.

Each function within the budget may include &quot;budget authority&quot; and &quot;outlays&quot; that fall within the broad categories of discretionary spending or direct spending.

==== Allocations ====
The 302(a) allocation specifies the total amount of money available to appropriates. They are generally included in the report accompanying the budget resolution, or if a budget resolution is not passed, each chamber may determine its own 302(a) allocation. This process was modified somewhat by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which is in effect though FY2021, which sets two overall caps for defense and nondefense spending that the 302(a) allocation must adhere to. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, also in effect through FY2021, gave the Chairs of the Budget Committees authority to determine 302(a) allocations.

The 302(b) allocations specify how funds are divided among the individual appropriations subcommittees, corresponding to the 12 appropriations bills. 302(b) allocations are adopted by the full House and Senate Appropriations Committees.

==== Appropriations bills ====

The budget resolutions specify funding levels for the House and Senate Appropriations Committees and their 12 subcommittees, establishing various budget totals, allocations, entitlements, and may include reconciliation instructions to designated House or Senate committees. The appropriations committees start with allocations in the budget resolution and draft appropriations bills, which may be considered in the House after May 15. Once appropriations committees pass their bills, they are considered by the House and Senate. When there is a final budget, the spending available to each appropriations committee for the coming fiscal year is usually provided in the joint explanatory statement included in the conference report. The appropriations committees then allocate that amount among their respective subcommittees, each to allocate the funds they control among the programs within their jurisdiction.

A conference committee is typically required to resolve differences between House and Senate appropriation bills. Once a conference bill has passed both chambers of Congress, it is sent to the President, who may sign the bill or veto it. If he signs, the bill becomes law. Otherwise, Congress must pass another bill to avoid a shutdown of at least part of the federal government.

In recent years, Congress has not passed all of the appropriations bills before the start of the fiscal year. Congress may then enact continuing resolutions that provide for the temporary funding of government operations. Failure to appropriate funds results in a partial government shutdown, such the federal government shutdown in October 2013.

In practice, the separation between policy making and funding and the division between appropriations and authorization activities are imperfect. Authorizations for many programs have long lapsed, yet still receive appropriated amounts, while other programs that are authorized receive no funds at all. In addition, policy language, which is legislative text changing permanent law, is included in appropriation measures.

==== Reconciliation bills ====

The budget resolution may also specify that a reconciliation bill may be introduced, which is subject to restrictions in its content but cannot be filibustered in the Senate.

==== Apportionment ====

Apportionment is the process by which the Office of Management and Budget specifies the funding level for specific agencies and programs within the constraints of the appropriations bills after they have passed.

== Mandatory spending ==

Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, refers to spending enacted by law, but not dependent on an annual or periodic appropriation bill. Most mandatory spending consists of transfer payments and earned benefits such as Social Security benefits, Medicare, and Medicaid. Many other expenses, such as salaries of federal judges, are mandatory, but account for a relatively small share of federal spending. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates costs of mandatory spending programs on a regular basis.
Congress can affect spending on entitlement programs by changing eligibility requirements or the structure of programs. Certain programs, because the language authorizing them are included in appropriation bills, are termed &quot;appropriated entitlements.&quot; This is a convention rather than a substantive distinction, since the programs, such as Food Stamps, would continue to be funded even were the appropriation bill to be vetoed or otherwise not enacted.

== Budget functions ==
The federal budget is divided into categories known as budget functions. These functions include all spending for a given topic, regardless of the federal agency that oversees the individual federal program. Both the President&#x27;s budget, and Congress&#x27; budget resolution provide summaries by function, but they do not line up with the twelve appropriations bills.

<text>Dame Joan Alston Sutherland, (7 November 1926 – 10 October 2010) was an Australian dramatic coloratura soprano known for her contribution to the renaissance of the bel canto repertoire from the late 1950s to the 1980s.

She possessed a voice combining agility, accurate intonation, pinpoint staccatos, a trill and a strong upper register, although music critics complained about her poor diction.

Sutherland was the first Australian to win a Grammy Award, for the year 1961 Best Classical Performance – Vocal Soloist (with or without orchestra) presented in 1962.

She was known as and is widely regarded as one of the greatest sopranos of all time.

==Early and personal life==
Joan Sutherland was born in Sydney, Australia, to Scottish parents and attended St Catherine&#x27;s School in the suburb of Waverley, New South Wales. As a child, she listened to and imitated her mother&#x27;s singing exercises. Her mother, a mezzo-soprano, had taken voice lessons but never considered singing as a career. Sutherland was 18 years old when she began seriously studying voice with John and Aida Dickens. She made her concert debut in Sydney, as Dido in a production of Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, in 1947. 

In 1949, as well as winning Australia&#x27;s most important competition, the (Sydney) Sun Aria, Joan Sutherland came third after the baritone Ronal Jackson in radio 3DB&#x27;s £1,000 Mobil Quest; Joan Sutherland won the Mobil Quest the next year (1950). 

In 1951, she made her stage debut in Eugene Goossens&#x27;s &quot;Judith&quot;. She then went to London to further her studies at the Opera School of the Royal College of Music with Clive Carey. She was engaged by the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, as a utility soprano, and made her debut there on 28 October 1952, as the First Lady in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, followed in November by a few performances as Clotilde in Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s opera &quot;Norma&quot;, with Maria Callas as Norma.

Being an admirer of Kirsten Flagstad in her early career, she trained to be a Wagnerian dramatic soprano. In December 1952, she sang her first leading role at the Royal Opera House, Amelia in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;. Other roles included Agathe in &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;, the Countess in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, Desdemona in &quot;Otello&quot;, Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, Eva in &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, and Pamina in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. In 1953, she sang the role of Lady Rich in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Gloriana&quot; a few months after its world premiere, and created the role of Jenifer in Michael Tippett&#x27;s &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot;, on 27 January 1955.

Sutherland married Australian conductor and pianist Richard Bonynge on 16 October 1954. Their son, Adam, was born in 1956. Bonynge gradually convinced her that Wagner might not be her &quot;Fach&quot;, and that since she could produce high notes and coloratura with great ease, she should perhaps explore the bel canto repertoire. She eventually settled in this &quot;Fach&quot;, spending most of her career singing dramatic coloratura soprano.

==Career==
In 1957, she appeared in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Alcina&quot; with the Handel Opera Society, and sang selections from Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Emilia di Liverpool&quot; in a radio broadcast. The following year she sang Donna Anna in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in Vancouver.

In 1959, Sutherland was invited to sing &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; at the Royal Opera House in a production conducted by Tullio Serafin and staged by Franco Zeffirelli. The role of Edgardo was sung by her fellow Australian Kenneth Neate, who had replaced the scheduled tenor at short notice. In 1960, she recorded the album &quot;The Art of the Prima Donna&quot;: the double LP set won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance – Vocal Soloist in 1962. The album was added to the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s Sounds of Australia registry in 2011.

Sutherland sang &quot;Lucia&quot; to great acclaim in Paris in 1960 and, in 1961, at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera. For her Met performance of &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, standees began lining up at 7:30 that morning. Her singing of the Mad Scene drew a 12-minute ovation. In 1960 she sang &quot;Alcina&quot; at La Fenice. Sutherland would soon be praised as &quot;La Stupenda&quot; in newspapers around the world. Later that year (1960), Sutherland sang &quot;Alcina&quot; at the Dallas Opera, with which she made her US debut.

Her Metropolitan Opera debut took place on 26 November 1961, when she sang &quot;Lucia&quot;. After a total of 223 performances in a number of different operas, her last appearance there was a concert on 12 March 1989. During the 1978–82 period her relationship with the Met deteriorated when Sutherland had to decline the role of Constanze in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, more than a year before the rehearsals were scheduled to start. The opera house management then declined to stage the operetta &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; especially for her, as requested; subsequently, she did not perform at the Met during that time at all, even though a production of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Semiramide&quot; had also been planned, but later she returned there to sing in other operas.

During the 1960s, Sutherland added the heroines of bel canto to her repertoire: Violetta in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;, Amina in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;La sonnambula&quot; and Elvira in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I puritani&quot; in 1960; the title role in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot; in 1961; Marguerite de Valois in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; and the title role in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Semiramide&quot; in 1962; Norma in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; and Cleopatra in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; in 1963. In 1966 she added Marie in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La fille du régiment&quot;.

In 1965, Sutherland toured Australia with the Sutherland-Williamson Opera Company. Accompanying her was a young tenor named Luciano Pavarotti.

During the 1970s, Sutherland strove to improve her diction, which had often been criticised, and increase the expressiveness of her interpretations. She continued to add dramatic bel canto roles to her repertoire, such as Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; and &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;, as well as Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Esclarmonde&quot;. With Pavarotti she made a studio-recording of &quot;Turandot&quot; in 1972 conducted by Zubin Mehta, though she never performed the role on stage.

Sutherland&#x27;s early recordings show her to be possessed of a crystal-clear voice and excellent diction. However, by the early 1960s her voice lost some of this clarity in the middle register, and she often came under fire for having unclear diction. Some have attributed this to sinus surgery; however, her major sinus surgery was done in 1959, immediately after her breakthrough &quot;Lucia&quot; at Covent Garden. In fact, her first commercial recording of the first and final scene of &quot;Lucia&quot; reveals her voice and diction to be just as clear as prior to the sinus procedure. Her husband Richard Bonynge stated in an interview that her &quot;mushy diction&quot; occurred while striving to achieve perfect legato. According to him, it is because she earlier had a very Germanic &quot;un-legato&quot; way of singing.

During the 1980s, Sutherland added &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;, Amalia in &quot;I masnadieri&quot;, and &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; to her repertoire, and repeated &quot;Esclarmonde&quot; at the Royal Opera House performances in November and December 1983. Her last full-length dramatic performance was as Marguerite de Valois (&quot;Les Huguenots&quot;) at the Sydney Opera House in 1990, at the age of 63, where she sang &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; for her encore. Her last public appearance, however, took place in a gala performance of &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1990, at Covent Garden, where she was accompanied by her colleagues Luciano Pavarotti and the mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne. According to her own words, given in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in 2002, her biggest achievement was to sing the title role in &quot;Esclarmonde&quot;. She considered those performances and recordings her best.

==Retirement years==

After retirement, Sutherland made relatively few public appearances, preferring a quiet life at her home in Les Avants, Switzerland. One exception was her 1994 address at a lunch organised by Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, when Sutherland commented: &quot;It also upsets me that it is such a damned job to get an Australian passport now – you have to go to be interviewed by a Chinese or an Indian. I&#x27;m not particularly racist, but I find it ludicrous.&quot; Her criticism caused controversy.

On 3 July 2008, she fell and broke both legs while gardening at her home in Switzerland.

==Film role==
Sutherland had a leading role as Mother Rudd in the 1995 comedy film &quot;Dad and Dave: On Our Selection&quot; opposite Leo McKern and Geoffrey Rush.

==Publications==
In 1997, she published an autobiography, &quot;A Prima Donna&#x27;s Progress&quot;. It received mixed reviews for its literary merits. &quot;Library Journal&quot; stated,

Opera superstar Dame Joan Sutherland gives an exhaustive account of her performing and recording career over four decades. From her early years in Australia and with the Covent Garden company in London, to her daunting schedule at most of the major opera houses of the world, we read endlessly of where, when, and with whom she sang which roles. We&#x27;re shown a sensible woman and a hard-working artist, with a healthy ego tempered by a sense of humor that is often self-deprecating.

The work includes a complete list of all her performances, with full cast lists.

Her official biography, &quot;Joan Sutherland: The Authorised Biography&quot;, published in February 1994, was written by Norma Major, wife of the then prime minister John Major.

In 2002, she appeared at a dinner in London to accept the Royal Philharmonic Society&#x27;s gold medal. She gave an interview to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in which she lamented the lack of technique in young opera singers and the dearth of good teachers. By this time she was no longer giving master classes herself; when asked by Italian journalists in May 2007 why this was, she replied: &quot;Because I&#x27;m 80 years old and I really don&#x27;t want to have anything to do with opera any more, although I do sit on the juries of singing competitions.&quot; The Cardiff Singer of the World competition was the one that Sutherland was most closely associated with after her retirement. She began her regular involvement with the event in 1993, serving on the jury five consecutive times and later, in 2003, becoming its patron.

==Death==

On 11 October 2010, Sutherland&#x27;s family announced that she had died at her home at Les Avants in Switzerland the previous day of cardiopulmonary failure – &quot;the heart just gave out...When it came to the point that she physically couldn&#x27;t do anything, she didn&#x27;t want to live any more. She wanted to go, she was happy to go, and in the end she died very, very peacefully.&quot; Though she recovered from her fall in 2008, it led to more serious health problems. A statement from her family said &quot;She&#x27;s had a long life and gave a lot of pleasure to a lot of people.&quot; Sutherland had requested a small, private funeral service. Her funeral was held on 14 October and Opera Australia planned a tribute to her. Artistic director of Opera Australia, Lyndon Terracini, said &quot;We won&#x27;t see her like again. She had a phenomenal range, size and quality of voice. We simply don&#x27;t hear that any more.&quot; Sutherland is survived by her husband, son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren.

Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said, &quot;She was of course one of the great opera voices of the 20th century,&quot; adding that Sutherland showed a lot of &quot;quintessential Australian values. She was described as down to earth despite her status as a diva. On behalf of all Australians I would like to extend my condolences to her husband Richard and son Adam and their extended family at this difficult time. I know many Australians will be reflecting on her life&#x27;s work today.&quot;

==Memorial service==
A State Memorial Service on 9 November 2010, arranged by Opera Australia, was held at the Sydney Opera House. Speakers at the service were Julia Gillard, Prime Minister of Australia; Professor Marie Bashir, the Governor of New South Wales; Moffatt Oxenbould, the former Artistic Director of Opera Australia; and Sutherland&#x27;s son, Adam Bonynge. The service was broadcast live by both ABC1 television and ABC Classic FM (radio) and streamed globally by ABC News 24. Further memorial services were held in Westminster Abbey on 15 February 2011, and in New York City on 24 May 2011, which was hosted by Marilyn Horne with an appearance by Richard Bonynge. In attendance were Sherrill Milnes, Norman Ayrton, Regina Resnik, and Spiro Malas.

==Voice==
===Vocal timbre===

Described as &quot;fresh,&quot; &quot;silvery&quot; and &quot;bell-like&quot; until 1963, Joan Sutherland&#x27;s voice later became &quot;golden&quot; and &quot;warm&quot;; music critic John Yohalem writes it was like &quot;molten honey caressing the line&quot;. In his book &quot;Voices, Singers and Critics&quot;, John Steane writes that &quot;if the tonal spectrum ranges from bright to dark, Sutherland&#x27;s place would be near the centre, which is no doubt another reason for her wide appeal.&quot; According to John Yohalem, &quot;Her lower register was a cello register, Stradivarius-hued.&quot; Her voice was full and rounded even in her highest notes, which were brilliant, but sometimes &quot;slightly acid.&quot;

In 1971, &quot;Time&quot; writes an article comparing Sutherland and Beverly Sills,
Originally bright and youthful-sounding, her voice darkened as she transformed herself into a coloratura. There is a suggestion of Callas&#x27; famous middle register in Sutherland&#x27;s vocal center—a tone that sounds as if the singer were singing into the neck of a resonant bottle. Today the Sutherland voice towers like a natural wonder, unique as Niagara or Mount Everest. Sills&#x27; voice is made of more ordinary stuff; what she shares with Callas is an abandon in hurling herself into fiery emotional music and a willingness to sacrifice vocal beauty for dramatic effect. Sutherland deals in vocal velvet, Sills in emotional dynamite. Sutherland&#x27;s voice is much larger, but its plush monochrome robs it of carrying power in dramatic moments. Sills&#x27; multicolored voice, though smaller, projects better and has a cutting edge that can slice through the largest orchestra and chorus. Sometimes, indeed, it verges on shrillness. [...] In slow, legato music, Sills has a superior sense of rhythm and clean attack to keep things moving; Sutherland&#x27;s more flaccid beat and her style of gliding from note to note often turn song into somnolence. Sills&#x27; diction in English, French and Italian is superb; Sutherland&#x27;s vocal placement produces mushy diction in any language, but makes possible an even more seamless beauty of tone than is available to Sills.

Describing Sutherland&#x27;s voice, John Yohalem writes:
On my personal color scale, which runs from a voluptuous red (Tebaldi) or blood-orange (Price) or purple (Caballé) or red-purple (Troyanos) to white-hot (Rysanek) or runny yellow-green (Sills), Sutherland is among the &quot;blue&quot; sopranos – which has nothing to do with &quot;blues&quot; in the pop sense of the term. (Ella Fitzgerald had a blue voice, but Billie Holiday had a blues voice, which is very different.) Diana Damrau is blue. Mirella Freni is blue-ish. Karita Mattila is ice blue. Régine Crespin was deep blue shading to violet. Sutherland was true blue (like the Garter ribbon). There is a coolness here that can take on the passion in the music but does not inject passion where the music lacks it, could possibly use it.

===Vocal category, size and range===

Although she is generally described as a dramatic coloratura soprano, &quot;categorizing Sutherland&#x27;s voice has always been extremely difficult, both the size and the sound present definitional problems [...] Aside from singing some roles popular among coloratura sopranos, Sutherland&#x27;s voice could not be more different.&quot;

In a 1961 profile in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, Sutherland said she initially had &quot;a big rather wild voice&quot; that was not heavy enough for Wagner, although she did not realise this until she heard &quot;Wagner sung as it should be.&quot;

Regarding the size of Sutherland&#x27;s voice, &quot;Opera Britannia&quot; praise &quot;a voice of truly heroic dimensions singing bel canto. It is doubtful if any soprano in this repertoire has fielded quite so much power and tone as Dame Joan, and this includes Callas and Tetrazzini. The contrast with other sopranos who sing the same roles is appropriately enough stupendous, with rival prima donnas producing small pin points of sound as compared to Sutherland&#x27;s seemingly endless cascades of full tone.&quot; In 1972, music critic Winthrop Sargeant describes her voice &quot;as large as that of a top-ranking Wagnerian soprano&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. French soprano Natalie Dessay states, &quot;She had a , voice and she was able to lighten suddenly and to take this quick coloratura and she had also the top high notes like a coloratura soprano but with a voice, which is very rare.&quot;

Sutherland&#x27;s vocal range extended from G below the staff (G3) to high F (F6), or high F-sharp (F6), although she never sang this last note in a public performance.

==Honours==
During her career and after, Sutherland received many honours and awards. She was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1961 Birthday Honours. That year she was named the Australian of the Year. Sutherland is a Distinguished Member of the Sigma Alpha Iota International Music Fraternity.

In the 1975 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, she was in the first group of people to be named Companions of the Order of Australia (AC) (the order had been created only in February 1975). She was elevated within the Order of the British Empire from Commander to Dame Commander (DBE) in the 1979 New Year Honours.

On 29 November 1991, the Queen bestowed on Sutherland the Order of Merit (OM).

==Awards==
In 1992 Sutherland was a founding patron and active supporter of the Tait Memorial Trust in London. A charity established by Isla Baring OAM, the daughter of Sir Frank Tait of J. C. Williamson&#x27;s to support young Australian performing artists in the UK. Sir Frank Tait was the Australian impresario who created and managed the Sutherland-Williamson tour of Australia in 1965.

Sutherland House and the Dame Joan Sutherland Centre, both at St Catherine&#x27;s School, Waverley, and the Joan Sutherland Performing Arts Centre (JSPAC), Penrith, are all named in her honour.

John Paul College, a leading private school in Queensland, Australia, dedicated its newly established facility the Dame Joan Sutherland Music Centre in 1991. Sutherland visited the centre for its opening and again in 1996.

She received the Lifetime Contribution Award in 2001 Echo Klassik.
In January 2004 she received the Australia Post &quot;Australian Legends Award&quot; which honours Australians who have contributed to the Australian identity and culture. Two stamps featuring Joan Sutherland were issued on Australia Day 2004 to mark the award. Later in 2004, she received a Kennedy Center Honor for her outstanding achievement throughout her career.

On 22 May 2007, the year of the of the birth of soprano Lina Pagliughi, she received the award &quot;La Siòla d&#x27;Oro&quot; at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna.

In 2012, Sutherland was voted into the first Hall of Fame of the magazine &quot;Gramophone&quot;.

In 2024, she was recognised in the Australian Women in Music Awards and was inducted into the AWMA Honour Roll. The award was accepted by Sutherland&#x27;s granddaughter.

<text>The Trout Quintet (&quot;Forellenquintett&quot;) is the popular name for the Piano Quintet in A major, D. 667, by Franz Schubert. The piano quintet was composed in 1819, when he was 22 years old; it was not published, however, until 1829, a year after his death.

Rather than the usual piano quintet ensemble of piano and string quartet, the &quot;Trout Quintet&quot; is written for piano, violin, viola, cello and double bass. 

According to Schubert&#x27;s friend Albert Stadler, it was modelled on an arrangement of Johann Nepomuk Hummel&#x27;s then-popular Septet in D Minor for Flute, Oboe, Horn, Viola, Cello, Bass and Piano, Op. 74. That arrangement, using the same, somewhat unusual instrumentation chosen by Schubert, had been published in Vienna in about 1817, only a few years before the composition of the &quot;Trout Quintet&quot;. It may also have been influenced by Hummel&#x27;s Quintet in E flat minor, Op. 87 .

== Nickname ==
The piece is known as the &quot;Trout&quot; because the fourth movement is a set of variations on Schubert&#x27;s earlier Lied &quot;Die Forelle&quot; (&quot;The Trout&quot;). The quintet was written for Sylvester Paumgartner, a wealthy music patron and amateur cellist from Steyr, Upper Austria, who also suggested that Schubert include a set of variations on the Lied. Sets of variations on melodies from his Lieder are found in four other works by Schubert: the &quot;Death and the Maiden Quartet&quot;, the &quot;Trockne Blumen&quot; (dried flowers) Variations for Flute and Piano (D. 802), the &quot;Wanderer Fantasy&quot;, and the Fantasia for Violin and Piano in C major (D. 934, on &quot;Sei mir gegrüßt&quot;).

==Analysis==
The quintet consists of five movements:

The rising sextuplet figure from the song&#x27;s accompaniment is used as a unifying motif throughout the quintet, and related figures appear in four out of the five movements – all but the Scherzo. As in the song, the figure is usually introduced by the piano, ascending.

The first movement is in sonata form. As is commonplace in works of the Classical genre, the exposition shifts from tonic to dominant; however, Schubert&#x27;s harmonic language is innovative, incorporating many mediants and submediants. This is evident from almost the beginning of the piece: after stating the tonic for ten bars, the harmony shifts abruptly into F major (the flatted submediant) in the eleventh bar.

The development section starts with a similar abrupt shift, from E major (at the end of the exposition) to C major. Harmonic movement is slow at first, but becomes quicker; towards the return of the first theme, the harmony modulates in ascending half tones.

The recapitulation begins in the subdominant, making any modulatory changes in the transition to the second theme unnecessary, a frequent phenomenon in early sonata form movements written by Schubert. It differs from the exposition only in omitting the opening bars and another short section, before the closing theme.

===II. Andante===
This movement is composed of two symmetrical sections, the second being a transposed version of the first, except for some differences of modulation which allow the movement to end in the same key in which it began. Tonal layout (with some intermediate keys of lower structural significance omitted) as follows:
:F major – F minor – D major – G major – G minor – G major; A major – A minor – F major – F minor – F major

===III. Scherzo: Presto===
This movement also contains mediant tonalities, such as the ending of the first section of the Scherzo proper, which is in C major, the flattened mediant, or the relative major of the parallel minor (A minor).

The fourth movement is a theme and variations on Schubert&#x27;s Lied &quot;Die Forelle&quot;. As typical of some other variation movements by Schubert (in contrast to Beethoven&#x27;s style), the variations do not transform the original theme into new thematic material; rather, they concentrate on melodic decoration and changes of mood. In each of the first few variations, the main theme is played by a different instrument or group. In the fifth variation, Schubert begins in the flat submediant (B major), and creates a series of modulations eventually leading back to the movement&#x27;s main key, at the beginning of the final sixth variation.

A similar process is heard in three of Schubert&#x27;s later compositions: the Octet in F major, D. 803 (fourth movement); the Piano Sonata in A minor, D. 845 (second movement); and the Impromptu in B major, D. 935 No. 3. The concluding variation is similar to the original Lied, sharing the same characteristic accompaniment in the piano.

===V. Allegro giusto===
The Finale is in two symmetrical sections, like the second movement. However, the movement differs from the second movement in the absence of unusual chromaticism, and in the second section being an exact transposition of the first (except for some changes of octave register). A repeat sign is written for the first section: if one adheres meticulously to the score, the movement consists of three lengthy, almost identical repeats of the same musical material. Performers sometimes choose to omit the repeat of the first section when playing.

Although this movement lacks the chromaticism of the second movement, its own harmonic design is also innovative: the first section ends in D major, the subdominant. This is contradictory to the aesthetics of the Classical musical style, in which the first major harmonic event in a musical piece or movement, is the shift from tonic to dominant (or, more rarely, to mediant or submediant – but never to the subdominant).

==Musical significance==
Compared to other major chamber works by Schubert, such as the last three string quartets and the string quintet, the &quot;Trout Quintet&quot; is a leisurely work, characterized by lower structural coherence, especially in its outer movements and the Andante. These movements contain unusually long repetitions of previously stated material, sometimes transposed, with little or no structural reworking, aimed at generating an overall unified dramatic design (&quot;mechanical&quot; in Martin Chusid&#x27;s words).

The importance of the piece stems mainly from its use of an original and innovative harmonic language, rich in mediants and chromaticism, and from its timbral characteristics. The &quot;Trout Quintet&quot; has a unique sonority among chamber works for piano and strings, due mainly to the piano part, which for substantial sections of the piece concentrates on the highest register of the instrument, with both hands playing the same melodic line an octave apart (having been freed to do so by the inclusion of both cello and bass in the ensemble). Such writing also occurs in other chamber works by Schubert, such as the piano trios, but to a much lesser extent, and is characteristic of Schubert&#x27;s works for piano four-hands, one of his most personal musical genres. Such timbral writing may have influenced the works of Romantic composers such as Frédéric Chopin, who admired Schubert&#x27;s music for piano four-hands.

The quintet forms the basis of Christopher Nupen&#x27;s 1969 film &quot;The Trout&quot;, in which Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman, Jacqueline du Pré, Daniel Barenboim and Zubin Mehta perform it at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London.

== Other uses ==
A portion of the &quot;Trout Quintet&quot;″s fifth movement, performed by the Nash Ensemble, is used as the theme music for the BBC television comedy &quot;Waiting for God&quot;. The third movement performed by the Nash Ensemble is also used in the show.

Samsung washing machines and clothes dryers play an arrangement of the first portion of the fourth movement upon finishing a spin cycle.

<text>Otto Erich Deutsch (5 September 1883 – 23 November 1967) was an Austrian musicologist. He is known for compiling the first comprehensive catalogue of Franz Schubert&#x27;s compositions, first published in 1951 in English, with a revised edition published in 1978 in German. It is from this catalogue that the &quot;D&quot; numbers used to identify Schubert&#x27;s works derive.

==Life==
Deutsch was born in Vienna on 5 September 1883 in a Jewish family.

Following his studies of art history and literature in Vienna and Graz, he worked as an assistant at the Department of Art History of the University of Vienna. His specialization was the Biedermeier period, which led naturally to his interest in Schubert, whose life took place during this cultural era. His scholarly career was interrupted by World War I when he served in the Austrian Army. Following the war Deutsch worked for a time as a bookseller. He also shifted his scholarly interests to historical musicology, eventually becoming music librarian, working in the archives of Anthony van Hoboken. In 1938, when Austria was taken over by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss, Deutsch decided to flee the country, as he was a Protestant of Jewish origin. He lived in Cambridge, England, from 1939 to 1951, returning to Vienna after the war.

Deutsch was a close friend of music theorist Heinrich Schenker, and of the British musicologist and Schubert scholar Maurice J. E. Brown.
Deutsch died in Baden bei Wien on 23 November 1967 at the age of 84. He is interred in an honorary grave of the Vienna Central Cemetery (group 40, no. 12).

==Scholarship==
According to David Wyn Jones, Deutsch&#x27;s work was based on &quot;an abiding belief that historical documents and iconographic evidence constituted the essential ingredients of biographical exposition.&quot; Hence, Deutsch composed &quot;documentary biographies&quot; of Schubert, Mozart and Handel; in them, the texts of the old documents are placed in chronological order, strung together with narration and commentary by Deutsch. In these biographies, Deutsch lets the documents speak for themselves, with his supplementary remarks providing clarifications, corrections, and context.

Deutsch also prepared conventional scholarly articles on these composers as well as on Joseph Haydn. He also edited and published musical texts, in particular Haydn&#x27;s output of canons.

He was awarded the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class in 1959.

<doc id="377172" wikidata="Q2604711" url="?curid=377172" title="A Boy Named Goo">
<text>A Boy Named Goo is the fifth studio album by American rock band Goo Goo Dolls, released in 1995 on Warner Bros. The album was a commercial success, and was certified double-platinum by the RIAA within a year of its release. This is the last Goo Goo Dolls album with George Tutuska on drums; he was replaced by Mike Malinin just before the album was released.

== History ==

This album is the Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; first studio album to not have 14 tracks. The song &quot;Stand Alone&quot; was written by George Tutuska, and because John Rzeznik didn&#x27;t want to exploit Tutuska’s efforts after his dismissal, the song was only included on a promo version of the album. On the wide-release version, it is replaced with &quot;Disconnected&quot; and &quot;Slave Girl&quot;, which were initially B-sides to the &quot;Only One&quot; single. On the same promo, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Unusual&quot; was labeled as &quot;Someday&quot;. The two replacement songs are covers of songs by defunct Buffalo and Sydney punk bands The Enemies and Lime Spiders.

The song &quot;Name&quot; is well known as the Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; first hit. According to lead singer John Rzeznik, the song&#x27;s unusual composition came about &quot;quite accidentally&quot;.

This album also marked the band&#x27;s last with the Metal Blade Records imprint.

== Walmart controversy ==

On June 5, 1996, the band&#x27;s label, Warner Bros., released a statement claiming that Walmart had decided to stop selling &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot; because some Walmart customers had complained that the album cover was offensive. The statement claimed that some customers had incorrectly thought that the child on the cover was smeared in blood rather than blackberry juice. Walmart acknowledged that they had decided to stop selling the album, but denied Warner Bros.&#x27;s claim that this was because of complaints about the cover art, instead ascribing the decision to weak sales. Of the reports that Walmart customers had thought that the child on the cover was smeared in blood, Rzeznik said, &quot;The name of the album is &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot;. The picture is of a boy covered with goo. What part of this concept are they unclear on?&quot;

== Track listing ==

All songs written by John Rzeznik, except where noted.
=== Advanced copy track listing ===

The track listing for advance copies—before George Tutuska was fired from the band—was slightly different. Neither of the covers were present, and another original song written solely by Tutuska, &quot;Stand Alone&quot;, was featured.

== Covers and media appearances ==
Metalcore band Haste the Day covered the song &quot;Long Way Down&quot; for their album &quot;When Everything Falls&quot;. &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Unusual&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the 1995 film &quot;Angus&quot;. A remix of the song &quot;Long Way Down&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the 1996 film &quot;Twister&quot;.

<doc id="377177" wikidata="Q1506685" url="?curid=377177" title="Orographic lift">
<text>[[Orography|Orographic]] lift occurs when an air mass is forced from a low elevation to a higher elevation as it moves over rising terrain. As the air mass gains altitude it quickly cools down adiabatically, which can raise the relative humidity to 100% and create clouds and, under the right conditions, precipitation.

Orographic lifting can have a number of effects, including precipitation, rain shadowing, leeward winds, and associated clouds.

== Precipitation ==

Precipitation induced by orographic lift occurs in many places throughout the world. Examples include:
* The Mogollon Rim in central Arizona
* The western slope of the Sierra Nevada range in California.
* The western slope of the Wasatch Range in Utah. Specifically the Little and Big Cottonwood Canyons.
* The mountains near Baja California North – specifically La Bocana to Laguna Hanson.
* The windward slopes of Khasi and Jayantia Hills (see Mawsynram) in the state of Meghalaya in India.
* The Western Highlands of Yemen, which receive by far the most rain in Arabia.
* The Western Ghats that run along India&#x27;s western coast.
* The northern slopes of the Pontides leading to the Black Sea, in Bulgaria, Turkey and Georgia.
* The Great Dividing Range of Eastern and South Eastern Australia which forces cold, moist westerlies up the inland slopes, originating from the Southern Ocean.
* The mountains of New Zealand, which face a prevailing westerly flow off the Tasman Sea.
* The mountains of western Tasmania which also face a prevailing westerly flow.
* The southern Andes, which face a prevailing westerly flow off the Pacific Ocean.
* The mountains of the Chocó Department in Colombia, which face a prevailing westerly flow off the Pacific Ocean and are one of the wettest places on Earth.
* The western uplands of Great Britain, including the Grampian mountains, Lake District, Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Dartmoor which face a prevailing westerly flow off the Atlantic Ocean.
* The Northwestern United States and Canada (Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Southern Alaska) see prevailing westerly flow off the northern Pacific Ocean. Places on the sea-facing side of coastal mountains see in excess of 140 inches (over 3.5 m) of precipitation per year. These locales are on the side of the mountains which are in the path of storm systems, and therefore receive the moisture which is effectively squeezed from the clouds.
* The ski country region of New York and Pennsylvania, particularly with lake effect snows.
* Transylvania County, North Carolina, which gets the most rainfall of anywhere in the Eastern U.S. ().
* The Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia (particularly the western facing slopes).
* The Eastern seaboard of Madagascar.
* Table Mountain, Cape Town, South Africa. The cold Atlantic air mass flows up over the north western face to above sea level and is met by the warm Indian Ocean air mass from the south eastern back side of the mountain forming the famous &quot;Table Cloth&quot;.
* Oppland mountain area, Norway.
* In Colorado west of Denver maximum snowfall is recorded at relatively low elevations, around Idaho Springs, Genesee, Evergreen, and even as low as Golden and Castle Rock.

== Rain shadowing ==

The highest precipitation amounts are found slightly upwind from the prevailing winds at the crests of mountain ranges, where they relieve and therefore the upward lifting is greatest. As the air descends the lee side of the mountain, it warms and dries, creating a rain shadow. On the lee side of the mountains, sometimes as little as 15 miles (25 km) away from high precipitation zones, annual precipitation can be as low as 8 inches (200 mm) per year.

Areas where this effect is observed include:
* The Himalayas block moisture from the Tibetan Plateau
* The Atacama Desert in Peru and Chile
* Switzerland&#x27;s Rhone valley
* Areas east of the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest (Washington and Oregon)
* Areas east of the Olympic Mountains in Washington state, (i.e. Sequim, Washington)
* The Great Basin of the United States, east of the Sierra Nevada
* Geography of the United States Pacific Mountain System
* Pacific Cordillera
* California&#x27;s Central Valley
* The Canadian Prairies
* The leeward sides of the Hawaiian Islands. The entire island of Kaho&#x27;olawe is in the rain shadow of Maui
* North East England is in the eastern rain shadow of the Pennines, due to Britain&#x27;s prevailing wind coming from the South West. This explains the significant differences between the rainfall between North West and North East England. This impact also occurs to varying degrees to the east of the Grampian Mountains, in Herefordshire and along the England Wales borders and in Devon to the east of Dartmoor.
* The Central Coast, Cumberland Plain, Illawarra, Monaro and the South Coast regions in Southeastern Australia in New South Wales; as snow-bearing westerlies arriving from the southwest (the Great Australian Bight) and up the ranges are forced upwind the inland slopes of the Great Dividing Range, the coastal plain remains dry and is significantly warmer than on the inland slopes at equivalent altitudes. This is evident when comparing Batlow on the windward slopes to Cooma on the leeward coastal plain, both around . Conversely, if the polar front or rain event arrives from the south-east (the Tasman Sea), then the coastal plain will be on the windward side and the inland slopes are on the leeward side.
* The Judean Desert in the Land of Israel and the Dead Sea.
* The Southern Alps of New Zealand

== Leeward winds ==
Downslope winds occur on the leeward side of mountain barriers when a stable air mass is carried over the mountain by strong winds that increase in strength with height. Moisture is removed and latent heat released as the air mass is orographically lifted. As the air mass descends, it is compression heated. The warm foehn wind, locally known as the Chinook wind, Bergwind or Diablo wind or Nor&#x27;wester depending on the region, provide examples of this type of wind, and are driven in part by latent heat released by orographic-lifting-induced precipitation.

A similar class of winds, the Sirocco, the Bora and Santa Ana winds, are examples where orographic lifting has limited effect since there is limited moisture to remove in the Saharan or other air masses; the Sirocco, Bora and Santa Ana are driven primarily by (adiabatic) compression heating.

== Associated clouds ==

As air flows over mountain barriers, orographic lift can create a variety of cloud effects.
* &quot;Orographic fog&quot; is formed as the air rises up the slope and will often envelope the summit. When the air is humid, some of the moisture will fall on the windward slope and on the summit of the mountain.
* When wind is strong, a &quot;banner cloud&quot; is formed downwind of the upper slopes of isolated, steep-sided mountains. It is created by the low pressure areas in the downwind vortices drawing in relatively humid air from the lower slopes of the mountain. This reduction in pressure compared to the surrounding air increases condensation, in the same manner as an aircraft&#x27;s wingtip vortices. The most famous such cloud forms routinely in the lee of the Matterhorn.

* The leeward edge of an extensive mass of orographic clouds may be quite distinct. On the leeward side of the mountain, the air flowing downward is known as a foehn wind. Because some of the moisture that has condensed on the top of the mountain has precipitated, the foehn (or föhn) is drier, and the lower moisture content causes the descending air mass to warm up more than it had cooled down during ascent. The distinct cut-off line which forms along and parallel to the ridge line is sometimes known as a &quot;foehn wall&quot; (or &quot;föhn wall&quot;). This is because the edge appears stationary and it often appears to have an abrupt wall-like edge. A foehn wall is a common feature along the Front Range of the Colorado Rockies.
* A &quot;rotor cloud&quot; is sometimes formed downwind and below the level of the ridge. It has the appearance of the ragged cumulus cloud type but it is caused by a turbulent horizontal vortex, i.e. the air is very rough.
* &quot;Lenticular clouds&quot; are stationary lens-shaped clouds that are formed downwind of mountains by lee waves if the air mass is close to the dew point. They are normally aligned at right-angles to the wind direction and are formed at altitudes up to .
* A &quot;cap cloud&quot; is a special form of the lenticular cloud with a base low enough that it forms around and covers the peak, capping it.
* A &quot;chinook arch cloud&quot; is an extensive wave cloud. It has this special name in North America where it is associated with the Chinook wind. It forms above the mountain range, usually at the beginning of a chinook wind as a result of orographic lifting over the range. It appears when seen from downwind to form an arch over the mountain range. A layer of clear air separates it from the mountain.

<doc id="377179" wikidata="Q1409704" url="?curid=377179" title="Madame Butterfly (short story)">
<text>&quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; is a short story by American lawyer and writer John Luther Long. It is based on the recollections of Long&#x27;s sister, Jennie Correll, who had been to Japan with her husband, a Methodist missionary. It was first published in &quot;Century Magazine&quot; in 1898 and adapted for the stage in 1900. Giacomo Puccini based his 1904 opera &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; on the play.

== Plot ==
US Navy Lieutenant Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton arrives in Nagasaki. He leases a house for 999 years and marries a 17-year old geisha, Cho-Cho-San. Pinkerton bans her family from visiting, and they disown her. Nevertheless, she feels she is &quot;the mos&#x27; bes&#x27; happy female woman in
Japan—mebby in that whole world&quot;.

Pinkerton&#x27;s duties take him away from Nagasaki, but he promises to return &quot;when the robins nest again&quot;. Cho-Cho-San has faith that he will return and bears their baby. She names him Trouble.

A marriage broker harangues Cho-Cho-San to take a new husband. He warns that if Pinkerton does return it will probably only be to retrieve his child. He introduces her to a prince named Yamadori who tells Cho-Cho-San that Pinkerton never viewed their marriage as permanent. Yamadori offers to marry Cho-Cho-San and help her keep Trouble. 

Cho-Cho-San visits the American consul, Mr. Sharpless. As Sharpless learns the full scope of Pinkerton&#x27;s actions, he grows ashamed and contemptuous of the officer. Sharpless encourages her to marry Yamadori.

Several weeks later, Pinkerton&#x27;s ship arrives. Cho-Cho-San has been keeping a faithful watch for it and is overcome with emotion. Her maid Suzuki helps prepare the house with flowers and arrange Pinkerton&#x27;s things the way he remembered them. Cho-Cho-San wears her finest kimono and hides behind a shoji to watch Pinkerton&#x27;s arrival. She waits all night to no avail. 

A week later, a civilian ship arrives. Cho-Cho-San spies Pinkerton on deck with a blonde woman. She keeps another fruitless vigil waiting for her husband&#x27;s homecoming. When Pinkerton&#x27;s ship leaves the harbor, Cho-Cho-San returns to Sharpless&#x27; office. Desperate to avoid inflicting more pain, Sharpless lies to Cho-Cho-San. He tells her that Pinkerton was ordered to China and could not return to her. Sharpless offers her an envelope full of money.

The blonde woman from the steamship bursts into the office and identifies herself as Pinkerton&#x27;s wife. She asks Sharpless to telegram Pinkerton to say that she had been to Cho-Cho-San&#x27;s house but could not find her. She asks if she can bring Trouble with her when she joins Pinkerton the following week.

Cho-Cho-San rushes home. She bids farewell to Suzuki and Trouble and shuts herself in her room to end her own life. She opens a wound in her throat and the blood drips down her chest. Suzuki silently enters the room with the baby and pinches him to make him cry. Cho-Cho-San lets the sword drop to the floor. As the baby crawls onto Cho-Cho-San&#x27;s lap, Suzuki dresses her wound. When Mrs. Pinkerton returns to the house the following day it is empty.

== Historical basis ==
Long&#x27;s sister Jennie Correll married a Methodist missionary and lived in Nagasaki. Through their correspondence, Long learned about the culture of Japan and various personalities that would become characters in his stories. Correll once told her brother about a &quot;dear little teahouse girl&quot; named &quot;Cho-San&quot; who was abandoned by the father of her child. He immediately turned it into a story and asked her input. 

Many people have tried to deduce the identities of the characters in Long&#x27;s story. Pinkerton and his friend Sayre appear in both &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; and Long&#x27;s 1895 novel &quot;Miss Cherry-Blossom of Tokyo&quot;. Musicologist Arthur Groos believes he tracked down the real Sayre and a likely candidate for Pinkerton. Another author speculated that Thomas Blake Glover is the man who adopted Cho-Cho-San&#x27;s son, but that evidence was dismissed as &quot;flimsy&quot;.

Pierre Loti thinly disguised himself in his 1887 novel &quot;Madame Chrysanthème&quot;. Because so much of Loti&#x27;s plot reappears in Long&#x27;s story, it is assumed to have been a source. However, &quot;temporary&quot; or &quot;Japanese marriages&quot; were a widespread phenomenon after the country&#x27;s liberalization of marriage laws, and a Japanese woman abandoned by her foreign spouse was far from a unique occurrence. Butterfly&#x27;s belief that her marriage was permanent was the deviation from the norm.

==Publication History==
Long&#x27;s story was an instant success. Just 10 months after it appeared in print, The Century Company rushed a book version to market. Appearing in October 1898, the book included several other Long stories, and began selling &quot;like hot cakes&quot;. In 1903, Century reissued the book with several tinted photographs by C. Yarnall Abbott.

==Adaptations==
===Plays===
The story interested American playwright David Belasco who collaborated with Long on a one-act adaption. &quot;Madame Butterfly: A Tragedy of Japan&quot; premiered in New York&#x27;s Herald Square Theatre on March 5, 1900 with Blanche Bates in the title role. Seven weeks later, Belasco took it to London&#x27;s Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre where it played to full houses and critical acclaim. Evelyn Millard played Madame Butterfly. Back in America, Belasco toured the play for the next two seasons.

In 1988, David Henry Hwang wrote a play entitled &quot;M. Butterfly&quot; based on the affair between French diplomat Bernard Boursicot and Peking opera singer Shi Pei Pu. He mined the sexist and racist clichés of Puccini&#x27;s opera to tell the story of a Westerner who fantasized about loving a Madame Butterfly. Hwang&#x27;s play was adapted into a film by David Cronenberg in 1993 and an opera by Huang Ruo in 2022.

===Musical Theater===
In the summer of 1900, while Giacomo Puccini was in London supervising the English premiere of &quot;Tosca&quot;, he saw David Belasco&#x27;s play. He spoke very little English, but Butterfly&#x27;s vigil struck him as an ideal subject for an opera. He rushed backstage to beg Belasco for permission. In April 1901, Puccini had finally settled on Butterfly as a subject and the rights were obtained. The resulting opera, &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, was one of Puccini&#x27;s favorites and became a cornerstone of the repertoire. It premiered on February 17, 1904 at La Scala in Milan.
The 1989 stage musical &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil, with lyrics by Boublil and Richard Maltby Jr., transfers the plot to the Vietnam War.

===Songs===
Long&#x27;s story inspired dozens of Tin Pan Alley songs. Popular music had long been fascinated with depicting Asia and Japan in particular. At the turn of the century, Japonisme and &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; became a touchstone for many songwriters. In 1900, George Hobart and Alfred Aarons retold the story in their song &quot;O Mona San: A Tokyo Tragedy&quot; and dedicated their work to David Belasco. &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; became the archetype for orientalist songs, and its core narrative was brutally summarized by L. Wolfe Gilbert in his lyrics for &quot;Singapore&quot;: &quot;He leaves, she grieves.&quot;

After Puccini&#x27;s opera became a hit, &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; songs were legion, including by composers as famous as Irving Berlin (&quot;Hurry Back to My Bamboo Shack&quot;) and George Gershwin (&quot;Yan-Kee&quot;, &quot;In the Heart of a Geisha&quot;). &quot;Butterfly&quot; songs often transferred the characters to other Asian locales, like Shanghai, and it was common to leave the heroine&#x27;s fate ambiguous. The most successful of all these tunes was &quot;Poor Butterfly&quot; (Golden/Hubbell) which became a standard. Puccini&#x27;s style was an intuitive fit for Tin Pan Alley songwriters and the jazz artists who cannibalized their work. &quot;Poor Butterfly&quot; was such a hit that it inspired dozens of answer songs.

===Film===
The story has been adapted for film several times:
*&quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; (1915 film), an American silent film directed by Sidney Olcott
*&quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, an alternative name for &quot;Harakiri&quot; (1919 film), a German silent film directed by Fritz Lang
*&quot;Le ménage moderne du Madame Butterfly&quot; (1920), a French pornographic film.
*&quot;The Toll of the Sea&quot; (1922), an American silent film directed by Chester Franklin

<doc id="377194" wikidata="Q355030" url="?curid=377194" title="Yoshitaka Amano">
<text>is a Japanese visual artist, character designer, illustrator, a scenic designer for theatre and film, and a costume designer. He first came into prominence in the late 1960s working on the anime adaptation of &quot;Speed Racer&quot;. Amano later became the creator of iconic and influential characters such as &quot;Gatchaman&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Honeybee Hutch&quot;, and &quot;Casshern&quot;. In 1982 he went independent and became a freelance artist, finding success as an illustrator for numerous authors, and worked on best-selling novel series, such as &quot;The Guin Saga&quot; and &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot;. He is also known for his commissioned illustrations for the popular video game franchise &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;.

Since the 1990s Amano has been creating and exhibiting paintings featuring his iconic retro pop icons in galleries around the world, primarily painting on aluminium box panels with acrylic and automotive paint. He is a five-time winner of the Seiun Award, and also won the 1999 Bram Stoker Award for his collaboration with Neil Gaiman, &quot;&quot;.

Amano&#x27;s influences include early Western comic books, Orientalism, art nouveau, and Japanese woodblock prints. In early 2010, he established Studio Devaloka, a film production company.

==Biography==
Amano was born in Shizuoka, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, to Yoshio (1917–1962) and Kesano (&quot;née&quot; Fujimoto) Amano. He is the youngest child of four. Amano&#x27;s father was a lacquer artist, specializing in traditional Suruga lacquerware. As a young adolescent, Yoshitaka Amano was fascinated with drawing. In 1967, he began working in the animation department of Tatsunoko Productions, where he was introduced to the early Japanese anime movement. His first paid project was for the &quot;Speed Racer&quot; anime franchise. He was a character designer for anime shows such as &quot;Time Bokan&quot;, &quot;Gatchaman&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Honeybee Hutch&quot;.

In the 1960s, Amano was exposed to Western art styles through comic books, which he claims among his artistic roots. He has cited Neal Adams as his favorite comic book artist, noting that he would often purchase used comics based on Adams&#x27;s cover artwork, only to be disappointed that the interior artist was different. Amano was also fascinated by the art styles of psychedelic art and pop art of the West, particularly the work of American Pop artist Peter Max. In the 1970s, Amano studied the artworks of the late 19th century and early 20th century European movement of Art Nouveau, as well as the Russian orientalists (Leon Bakst, Ivan Bilibin) and the ancient Japanese hand woodblock printing work of Ukiyo-e. Amano remained at Tatsunoko Productions until 1982.

===Early fantasy works===
During the 1980s, Amano concentrated on illustrations for science fiction and fantasy works. Combined with the influence of his prior experience in animation, this focus resulted in a personal style influenced by both modern surrealism and realism.

He left Tatsunoko Production and started his activities as a freelancer in 1982. He did illustration and cover page design of Kimaira series, written by Baku Yumemakura, from this year. In 1983, he illustrated the novel &quot;Demon City Shinjuku&quot; and the first in Hideyuki Kikuchi&#x27;s &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; novel series. He also worked as a character designer on the 1985 movie adaptation of &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot;, which was one of the first anime movies to be released outside Japan. In interviews, however, Amano has stated that he was not pleased with the final product of the movie.

His illustrations begin to be published in collections such as &quot;Maten&quot; in 1984. That year he drew the manga Amon Saga, written by Baku Yumemakura, which was later adapted into an OVA.

===Video games===

In 1987, Amano joined Square (now known as Square Enix) to work on a role-playing video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System: &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. Amano produced conceptual design pieces for the game in both traditional and computer designed artwork. At this time, he also worked for another video game company, Kure Software Koubou, producing box cover illustrations as well as some character designs. This work included designs for Kure&#x27;s &quot;First Queen&quot; series. Following &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; in 1994, he stepped down as the main character, image, and graphic designer of the series. He continued to provide promotional and character artwork for the following games and to design their title logos.

Amano became the world&#x27;s highest-earning artist in 1996, earning that year from sales of silk screens, lithographs and etchings based on his book illustrations. His work began receiving international recognition following the release of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in 1997. In 2006, Hironobu Sakaguchi, the former designer and creator of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, recruited Amano and composer Nobuo Uematsu to work on video games at Mistwalker.

Amano and Nobuo Uematsu worked together again on videogames like &quot;Fairy Fencer F&quot; at Compile Heart.

===Branching out===
Amano&#x27;s first exhibition, called &quot;Hiten&quot;, was held in 1989 at Yurakucho Mullion in Tokyo, Japan. In 1990, he began to work as an artist and set designer for stage theater. His first work for theater was Tamasaburo Bando&#x27;s &quot;Nayotake&quot;.

Beginning in 1995 with his work at the Biennale d&#x27;Orléans in France, he received increased recognition outside Japan. Further international exhibitions followed, including the 1999 &quot;Hero&quot; at the Angel Orensanz Foundation and the 1997 workshop and exhibition &quot;Think Like Amano&quot;.

In 1998, Amano appeared as Hiroshi in the movie &quot;New Rose Hotel&quot;, loosely based on the William Gibson short story of the same name.

===Freelancing===
In 2000, Amano illustrated Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman: The Dream Hunters&quot;, which won several awards and was nominated for a Hugo Award. In 2001, Greg Rucka and Amano collaborated on another comic book tale, &quot;Elektra and Wolverine: The Redeemer&quot;. His character designs were used in another Vampire Hunter D movie entitled &quot;Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust&quot;. In 2006, the first volume of his &quot;HERO&quot; series was released by Boom! Studios. He was key visual and costume designer for movies written by Baku Yumemakura, including &quot;Onmyoji&quot;, &quot;Onmyoji 2&quot;, and &quot;Taitei no Ken&quot;.

He illustrated three album covers for the Japanese power metal band Galneryus: &quot;The Flag of Punishment&quot; (2003), &quot;Advance to the Fall&quot; (2005), and &quot;Beyond the End of Despair&quot; (2006).

In 2004 Amano was asked by creative director GK Reid to create illustrations in collaboration with author Neil Gaiman and featuring David Bowie and Iman as sci-fi characters, for &quot;The Return of the Thin White Duke&quot; a portion of which were published in V Magazine.

In 2008, Amano created an illustrated adaptation of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s The Magic Flute, published by Radical Comics. He also collaborated with Christopher &quot;mink&quot; Morrison of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s A Band Apart production company, providing illustrations for the novel &quot;Shinjuku&quot; and &quot;Shinjuku Azul&quot;, as well as a third unannounced follow up and an online game, &quot;Shinjuku Nexus&quot;. He was the character designer for the 2009 &quot;Jungle Emperor&quot; (&quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;) TV special, directed by Gorō Taniguchi, to commemorate both the 50th anniversary of Fuji Television and the 80th anniversary of Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s birth.

===Studio Devaloka===
In 2010, following a small solo art exhibition tour titled &quot;Devaloka&quot; it was announced that Amano had established a film production company, Studio Devaloka, and would be directing a 3D anime titled &quot;Zan&quot;, with additional projects to be announced in the future. On December 15, 2010, the official website for the film, now titled &quot;Deva Zan&quot;, was unveiled, along with information concerning an upcoming press conference, to be held on December 21, 2010. The roughly ten-minute-long conference revealed details about the project, including staff, as well as a short trailer for the film, which stylistically emulates the look of Amano&#x27;s paintings.

In April 2012, an illustrated novel adaptation of the work was announced by Dark Horse Manga. To be released in January 2013, the novel will be Amano&#x27;s debut as an author and will include over 240 original illustrations. Despite a projected 2012 release date, Amano stated in an October 2012 interview that the animation project was still in its development and funding stages and may instead be realized as a TV series. The possibility of a video game adaptation was also mentioned.

In 2013, Amano collaborated with Japanese rock star Hyde (L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel/VAMPS) on an art exhibition titled &quot;Destiny and Decay: Nippon Evolution&quot;.

On July 2, 2023, Amano appeared at Anime Expo to reveal the cover art for the classical single &quot;Requiem&quot; by rock artist Yoshiki.

<text>The Université de Sherbrooke (UdeS; English: &quot;University of Sherbrooke&quot;) is a French-language public research university in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada, with a second campus in Longueuil, a suburb on the South Shore of Montreal. It is one of two universities in the Estrie region of Quebec (the other one being Bishop&#x27;s University), and the only French-language university for the region.

As of 2022, the Université de Sherbrooke is home to 31,000 students, and an additional 3,000 older learners (age 50+) in continuing education in its &quot;University of the Third Age&quot;. Of its 7,400 employees, about 4,000 are teaching staff. The university has over 100,000 graduates and offers 46 undergraduate, 48 master&#x27;s and 27 doctoral programs. It holds a total of 61 research chairs, among which are the pharmacology, microelectronics, statistical learning, and environment research chairs.

==Campus==
The Université de Sherbrooke has five campuses:

* The Main Sherbrooke Campus
* The Sherbrooke Health Campus
* The Longueuil Campus
* The Joint Campus in Saguenay (on the site of the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi)
* The Joint Campus in Moncton (on the site of the Université de Moncton, in Moncton, New Brunswick).

==History==
The Université de Sherbrooke was established in 1954 as a French-speaking Catholic university in a region that had historically been English speaking, the Estrie, or Eastern Townships in English. The only university in this region for over 100 years was the English-based Anglican Bishop&#x27;s University. The Roman Catholic Church created this university in an effort to provide a more convenient education for the Catholic and French speakers in the region. Initially there was a religious component to the pedagogical activities, but by the end of the 1960s the number of priests working for the university had greatly diminished during the Quiet Revolution. In 1975, the appointment of a layman as Rector marked the end of religious activity in the institution. The Department of Theology is still officially Roman Catholic, alone in Quebec in this regard.

In 1991, the campus in Longueuil was opened, located adjacent to the Longueuil Metro station and the Pont Jacques-Cartier.

Université de Sherbrooke&#x27;s arms, supporters, flag, and badge were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on January 15, 2004. Université de Sherbrooke&#x27;s crest and Supporters were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on April 20, 2007. The motto of the school is &quot;Veritatem in Charitate&quot; (&quot;Truth through charity&quot;).

In 2006, the university opened a branch of its medical facility on the campus of UQAC, where its students enrol for medical courses. The number of students attending the Université de Sherbrooke continues to rise and the university has worked with the City of Sherbrooke to respond to the increase. Activities at the Université de Sherbrooke are mainly centred on teaching and research.

<doc id="377201" wikidata="Q2485705" url="?curid=377201" title="Addington, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Addington is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, about west of Winslow and south east of Buckingham. According to the 2001 and 2011 census&#x27; it had a population of 145. It is part of the Buckinghamshire Council unitary authority area.

First recorded as &quot;Edintone&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, its name means &quot;Eadda&#x27;s Estate&quot;. Nearby Adstock is named after the same person. The manor at that time was in the possession of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux.

A notable building in the village is the Mansion House, which is a 19th-century building on the site of the much older manor. The former manor house was used twice during the English Civil War as the national headquarters of the Parliamentarian forces.

During the Second World War from 1940 to 1945 Addington House was the residence or safe-house of the Moravec, Strankmüller and Tauer families of the Czechoslovak Military Intelligence staff, who had their headquarters in London. It was Colonel František Moravec who planned the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich (although this was masterminded in London not at Addington). The President of Czechoslovakia, Edvard Beneš, lived at The Abbey in nearby Aston Abbotts.

The parish church is dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin. The church has three bells (the oldest dating as far back as 1666) hung for English change ringing and one sanctus bell hung for chiming.

Possibly in November 1890, a temperature of -21.1 °C (-5.8 °F) was recorded. However, the temperature is of dubious authenticity and if it is correct, it would be the lowest temperature in November in England.

<doc id="377202" wikidata="Q4109953" url="?curid=377202" title="Branching process">
<text>In probability theory, a branching process is a type of mathematical object known as a stochastic process, which consists of collections of random variables indexed by some set, usually natural or non-negative real numbers. The original purpose of branching processes was to serve as a mathematical model of a population in which each individual in generation formula_1 produces some random number of individuals in generation formula_2, according, in the simplest case, to a fixed probability distribution that does not vary from individual to individual. Branching processes are used to model reproduction; for example, the individuals might correspond to bacteria, each of which generates 0, 1, or 2 offspring with some probability in a single time unit. Branching processes can also be used to model other systems with similar dynamics, e.g., the spread of surnames in genealogy or the propagation of neutrons in a nuclear reactor.

A central question in the theory of branching processes is the probability of ultimate extinction, where no individuals exist after some finite number of generations. Using Wald&#x27;s equation, it can be shown that starting with one individual in generation zero, the expected size of generation &quot;n&quot; equals &quot;μ&quot;&quot;n&quot; where &quot;μ&quot; is the expected number of children of each individual. If &quot;μ&quot; &lt; 1, then the expected number of individuals goes rapidly to zero, which implies ultimate extinction with probability 1 by Markov&#x27;s inequality. Alternatively, if &quot;μ&quot; &gt; 1, then the probability of ultimate extinction is less than 1 (but not necessarily zero; consider a process where each individual either has 0 or 100 children with equal probability. In that case, &quot;μ&quot; = 50, but probability of ultimate extinction is greater than 0.5, since that&#x27;s the probability that the first individual has 0 children). If &quot;μ&quot; = 1, then ultimate extinction occurs with probability 1 unless each individual always has exactly one child.

In theoretical ecology, the parameter &quot;μ&quot; of a branching process is called the basic reproductive rate.

== Mathematical formulation ==

The most common formulation of a branching process is that of the Galton–Watson process. Let &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot; denote the state in period &quot;n&quot; (often interpreted as the size of generation &quot;n&quot;), and let &quot;X&quot;&quot;n,i&quot; be a random variable denoting the number of direct successors of member &quot;i&quot; in period &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;X&quot;&quot;n,i&quot; are independent and identically distributed random variables over all &quot;n&quot; ∈{ 0, 1, 2, ...} and &quot;i&quot; ∈ {1, ..., &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot;}. Then the recurrence equation is

:formula_3

with &quot;Z&quot;0 = 1.

Alternatively, the branching process can be formulated as a random walk. Let &quot;S&quot;&quot;i&quot; denote the state in period &quot;i&quot;, and let &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; be a random variable that is iid over all &quot;i&quot;. Then the recurrence equation is

:formula_4

with &quot;S&quot;0 = 1. To gain some intuition for this formulation, imagine a walk where the goal is to visit every node, but every time a previously unvisited node is visited, additional nodes are revealed that must also be visited. Let &quot;S&quot;&quot;i&quot; represent the number of revealed but unvisited nodes in period &quot;i&quot;, and let &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; represent the number of new nodes that are revealed when node &quot;i&quot; is visited. Then in each period, the number of revealed but unvisited nodes equals the number of such nodes in the previous period, plus the new nodes that are revealed when visiting a node, minus the node that is visited. The process ends once all revealed nodes have been visited.

=== Continuous-time branching processes ===
For discrete-time branching processes, the &quot;branching time&quot; is fixed to be &quot;1&quot; for all individuals. For continuous-time branching processes, each individual waits for a random time (which is a continuous random variable), and then divides according to the given distribution. The waiting time for different individuals are independent, and are independent with the number of children. In general, the waiting time is an exponential variable with parameter &quot;λ&quot; for all individuals, so that the process is Markovian.

== Extinction problem for a Galton–Watson process==
The ultimate extinction probability is given by

:formula_5

For any nontrivial cases (trivial cases are ones in which the probability of having no offspring is zero for every member of the population - in such cases the probability of ultimate extinction is 0), the probability of ultimate extinction equals one if &quot;μ&quot; ≤ 1 and strictly less than one if &quot;μ&quot; &gt; 1.

The process can be analyzed using the method of probability generating function. Let &quot;p&quot;0, &quot;p&quot;1, &quot;p&quot;2, ... be the probabilities of producing 0, 1, 2, ... offspring by each individual in each generation. Let &quot;d&quot;&quot;m&quot; be the extinction probability by the &quot;m&quot;th generation, starting with a single individual (i.e. formula_6). Obviously, &quot;d&quot;0 = 0 and &quot;d&quot;1 = &quot;p&quot;0. Since the probabilities for all paths that lead to 0 by the &quot;m&quot;th generation must be added up, the extinction probability is nondecreasing in generations. That is,

:formula_7

Therefore, &quot;d&quot;&quot;m&quot; converges to a limit &quot;d&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; is the ultimate extinction probability. If there are &quot;j&quot; offspring in the first generation, then to die out by the mth generation, each of these lines must die out in &quot;m&quot; − 1 generations. Since they proceed independently, the probability is (&quot;d&quot;&quot;m&quot;−1) &quot;j&quot;. Thus,

:formula_8

The right-hand side of the equation is a probability generating function. Let &quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) be the ordinary generating function for &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;:

:formula_9

Using the generating function, the previous equation becomes

:formula_10

Since &quot;d&quot;&quot;m&quot; → &quot;d&quot;, &quot;d&quot; can be found by solving

:formula_11

This is also equivalent to finding the intersection point(s) of lines &quot;y&quot; = &quot;z&quot; and &quot;y&quot; = &quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) for &quot;z&quot; ≥ 0. &quot;y&quot; = &quot;z&quot; is a straight line. &quot;y&quot; = &quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is an increasing (since formula_12) and convex (since formula_13) function. There are at most two intersection points. Since (1,1) is always an intersect point for the two functions, there only exist three cases:

Case 1 has another intersect point at &quot;z&quot; &lt; 1 (see the red curve in the graph).

Case 2 has only one intersect point at &quot;z&quot; = 1.(See the green curve in the graph)

Case 3 has another intersect point at &quot;z&quot; &gt; 1.(See the black curve in the graph)

In case 1, the ultimate extinction probability is strictly less than one. For case 2 and 3, the ultimate extinction probability equals to one.

By observing that &quot;h′&quot;(1) = &quot;p&quot;1 + 2&quot;p&quot;2 + 3&quot;p&quot;3 + ... = &quot;μ&quot; is exactly the expected number of offspring a parent could produce, it can be concluded that for a branching process with generating function &quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) for the number of offspring of a given parent, if the mean number of offspring produced by a single parent is less than or equal to one, then the ultimate extinction probability is one. If the mean number of offspring produced by a single parent is greater than one, then the ultimate extinction probability is strictly less than one.

==Size dependent branching processes==
Along with discussion of a more general model of branching processes known as age-dependent branching processes by Grimmett, in which individuals live for more than one generation, Krishna Athreya has identified three distinctions between size-dependent branching processes which have general application. Athreya identifies the three classes of size-dependent branching processes as sub-critical, stable, and super-critical branching measures. For Athreya, the central parameters are crucial to control if sub-critical and super-critical unstable branching is to be avoided. Size dependent branching processes are also discussed under the topic of resource-dependent branching process

== Example of extinction problem ==
Consider a parent can produce at most two offspring. The extinction probability in each generation is:

:formula_14

with &quot;d&quot;0 = 0. For the ultimate extinction probability, we need to find &quot;d&quot; which satisfies &quot;d&quot; = &quot;p&quot;0 + &quot;p&quot;1d + &quot;p&quot;2&quot;d&quot;2.

Taking as example probabilities for the numbers of offspring produced &quot;p&quot;0 = 0.1, &quot;p&quot;1 = 0.6, and &quot;p&quot;2 = 0.3, the extinction probability for the first 20 generations is as follows:

In this example, we can solve algebraically that &quot;d&quot; = 1/3, and this is the value to which the extinction probability converges with increasing generations.

== Simulating branching processes ==
Branching processes can be simulated for a range of problems. One specific use of simulated branching process is in the field of evolutionary biology. Phylogenetic trees, for example, can be simulated under several models, helping to develop and validate estimation methods as well as supporting hypothesis testing.

== Multitype branching processes ==
In multitype branching processes, individuals are not identical, but can be classified into &quot;n&quot; types. After each time step, an individual of type &quot;i&quot; will produce individuals of different types, and formula_15, a random vector representing the numbers of children in different types, satisfies a probability distribution on formula_16.

For example, consider the population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and non-stem cancer cells (NSCCs). After each time interval, each CSC has probability formula_17 to produce two CSCs (symmetric division), probability formula_18 to produce one CSC and one NSCC (asymmetric division), probability formula_19 to produce one CSC (stagnation), and probability formula_20 to produce nothing (death); each NSCC has probability formula_21 to produce two NSCCs (symmetric division), probability formula_22 to produce one NSCC (stagnation), and probability formula_23 to produce nothing (death).

=== Law of large numbers for multitype branching processes ===
For multitype branching processes that the populations of different types grow exponentially, the proportions of different types converge almost surely to a constant vector under some mild conditions. This is the strong law of large numbers for multitype branching processes.

For continuous-time cases, proportions of the population expectation satisfy an ODE system, which has a unique attracting fixed point. This fixed point is just the vector that the proportions converge to in the law of large numbers.

The monograph by Athreya and Ney summarizes a common set of conditions under which this law of large numbers is valid. Later there are some improvements through discarding different conditions.

==Other branching processes==

There are many other branching processes, for example, branching processes in random environments, in which the reproduction law is chosen randomly at each generation, or branching processes, where the growth of the population is controlled by external influences or interacting processes. Branching processes where particles have to work (contribute resources to the environment) in order to be able to reproduce,
and live in a changing society structure controlling the distribution of resources, are so-called resource-dependent branching processes.

The scaling limit of near-critical branching processes can be used to obtain superprocesses.

<text>Solo whist is the English form of Wiezen (Belgian or Ghent Whist), a simple game of the Boston family played in the Low Countries. It is a trick-taking card game for four players in which players can bid to make eight tricks in trumps with any partner, or a solo contract playing against the other three players. Thus it combines both partnership and cut-throat play. Scoring is with small stakes won or paid out on each hand.

==History==
Wiezen or Belgian Whist, a simple form of Boston, has been played in the Low Countries since the early 19th Century. The game was introduced to London in 1852 by a family of Dutch Jews. It quickly became popular in London&#x27;s Jewish Community and was known as Solo Whist. In the early 1870s Solo Whist was played as a low stakes gambling game in London&#x27;s sporting clubs as a replacement for more complex and slower games like Whist.

Solo Whist continued to be played as a social gambling game in homes and pubs during the 20th Century in Britain, Australia and New Zealand, however, its popularity declined as Contract Bridge&#x27;s rose.

==Dealing==
The cards are shuffled by the dealer and cut by the player to dealer&#x27;s right. Cards are usually dealt 3,3,3,3,1 with the last card to the dealer dealt face up to indicate the trump suit. Others deal with a rotating 4th card: 4333, 3433, 3343, 3334 or deal the cards singly as in Bridge.

==Bidding==
Beginning with the player to dealer&#x27;s left, each competitor may make one of the bids in the table below or pass. If someone bids, then subsequent players can either pass or bid higher. The bidding continues around the table as many times as necessary until the contract is settled. If everyone passes or there is a Prop without a Cop then the hands are thrown in and dealt again.

==Play==
The player to the dealer&#x27;s left leads the first trick, except in the case of an Abundance Declared in which case the bidder leads. Any card may be led and the other three players must follow suit where possible. A player with no card of the led suit may play a trump. If any trumps are played, then the trick is won by the highest trump card. If there are no trumps, it is won by the highest card in the suit that was led. The winner of the trick gets to lead to the next. Once a player has succeeded or failed in their bid, scores are adjusted. The deal then passes to the left and the next hand begins.

==Variations==

===Morris Fagelson ===

A common version of Solo played among the Jewish community in Essex and East London show the following differences:

*A Prop and Cop pairing need to win seven tricks. Players only get one bid, except the person to the dealer&#x27;s left who is able to bid twice, although, if someone Props without a Cop, they still have the option to upgrade to a Solo no matter where they sit. The Proposer picks the trump in an Abundance Declared hand.

===Straight Solo===
*In this variation, Prop and Cop is eliminated and only individual hands are allowed.

===High-scoring Solo===
*To increase the proportion of distributional hands, some play that the cards are only lightly shuffled, shuffled only at the beginning, after a bid of abundance, or not shuffled at all. This can be enforced with 1 point penalty for shuffling inappropriately.

===Different Trumps===
*To avoid turning the dealer&#x27;s last dealt card for trump, a second pack can be used for cutting Trumps. Like any form of Whist, Solo Whist can be played with rotating trumps: H, D, C, S as in Bridge Whist. No Trumps can be included in the rotation. Or the game can be played with a fixed Trump suit as in Spades.

===Grand Slam Solo===
*Uses rules for the Straight Solo and High-scoring Solo above, as well as the cyclical trump order described in &quot;Different Trumps&quot; above. Additionally, the &quot;Abundance Declared&quot; is replaced with two bids: A Petit Slam and a Grand Slam. The Petit Slam requires the bidder to make 12 tricks, and is scored above a Royal Abundance but below a Misère Ouverte. The Grand Slam, like an Abundance Declared, requires the bidder to make all 13 tricks, and ranks above all other bids. Both the Petit and Grand Slam bids allow the declarer to choose the trump suit.

===Overtricks===
*To spice up the game further, some play with a payment for overtricks in Prop and Cop, Solo and Abundance. In that case it is usual to set the basic score for a solo as four, five or six units, increasing the other scores in proportion. Each overtrick or undertrick in a Prop and Cop or Solo is worth an extra unit. In Abundance, overtricks gain an extra two units each, but undertricks cost only one unit each. There is no score for over or undertricks in Misère, Misère Ouverte or Abundance Declared.

===Irish Solo===
Solo Whist is not to be confused with Irish Solo, which is not related to Solo Whist, German Solo or Spanish Solo. It is a form of Cut-Throat Bid Whist for four players. The suit rankings are the same as Contract Bridge (NT,S,H,D,C) but the bids are for a number of tricks and denomination like in 500 or Preferans, not for odd tricks as in Bridge. So a bid of Six Spades is an undertaking to make six tricks and would be beaten by a bid of Six No Trumps or Seven Clubs. The winner of the auction is Declarer and plays solo against the other three players. A bid of Misère is an undertaking to win no tricks, and is equivalent in rank to a bid of 12 Tricks.

Pot betting is sometimes played, with the pot equal to an agreed stake multiplied by the number of tricks bid. If Declarer makes their contract they are paid 1/3 the value of the pot by each of the other three players. If they fail they pay out 1/3 of the Pot to each of the other players.

== In literature==
In Robert W Service&#x27;s poem &quot;The Shooting of Dan McGrew&quot;, Dan McGrew is playing Solo in the back of the bar. His bid is &quot;Spread Misère&quot; (Misère Ouverte).

==Trivia==
*The words &quot;Misère&quot;, &quot;Ouverte&quot;, &quot;Grand&quot;, and &quot;Petit&quot; are French and mean misery, open, large, and small, respectively. The hands Royal Abundance and Abundance Declared are also known as Abundance Royale and Abundance Declaree; Abundance is sometimes nicknamed Bundle.

<doc id="377204" wikidata="Q1075697" url="?curid=377204" title="Fire ant">
<text>Fire ants are several species of ants in the genus Solenopsis, which includes over 200 species. &quot;Solenopsis&quot; are stinging ants, and most of their common names reflect this, for example, ginger ants and tropical fire ants. Many of the names shared by this genus are often used interchangeably to refer to other species of ant, such as the term red ant, mostly because of their similar coloration despite not being in the genus Solenopsis. Both &quot;Myrmica rubra&quot; and &quot;Pogonomyrmex barbatus&quot; are common examples of non-Solenopsis ants being termed red ants.

None of these common names apply to all species of &quot;Solenopsis&quot; nor exclusively to species of &quot;Solenopsis&quot;; for example, several species of weaver ants of the genus &quot;Oecophylla&quot; in Southeast Asia are colloquially called &quot;fire ants&quot; because of their similar coloration and painful bites, but the two genera are not closely related. &quot;Wasmannia auropunctata&quot; is another unrelated ant more commonly called the &quot;little fire ant&quot; due to its potent sting.

==Appearance==
The bodies of mature fire ants, like the bodies of all typical mature insects, are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen, with three pairs of legs and a pair of antennae. Fire ants of those species invasive in the United States can be distinguished from other ants locally present by their copper brown head and thorax with a darker abdomen. The worker ants are blackish to reddish and their size varies from . In an established nest these different sizes of ants are all present at the same time.

&quot;Solenopsis&quot; spp. ants can be identified by three body features—a pedicel with two nodes, an unarmed propodeum, and antennae with 10 segments plus a two-segmented club. Many ants bite, and formicine ants can cause irritation by spraying formic acid; myrmecine ants like fire ants have a dedicated venom-injecting sting, which injects an alkaloid venom, as well as mandibles for biting.

==Behavior==

A typical fire ant colony produces large mounds in open areas, and feeds mostly on young plants, insects and seeds. Fire ants often attack small animals such as small lizards and can kill them. Unlike many other ants, which bite and then spray acid on the wound, fire ants bite only to get a grip and then sting (from the abdomen) and inject a toxic alkaloid venom called solenopsin, a compound from the class of piperidines. For humans, this is a painful sting, a sensation similar to what one feels when burned by fire (hence the name), and the after-effects of the sting can be deadly to sensitive people. Fire ants are more aggressive than most native species, so have pushed many species away from their local habitat. One such species that &quot;Solenopsis&quot; ants parasitically take advantage of are bees, such as &quot;Euglossa imperialis&quot;, a nonsocial orchid bee species, from which the ants enter the cells from below the nest and rob the cell&#x27;s contents.

These ants are renowned for their ability to survive extreme conditions. They do not hibernate, but can survive cold conditions, although this is costly to fire ant populations as observed during several winters in Tennessee, where 80 to 90% of colonies died due to several consecutive days of extremely low temperatures.

Fire ants have been known to form mutualistic relationships with several species of Lycaenidae and Riodinidae butterflies. In &quot;Lycaena rubidus&quot;, the larvae secrete a fluid that is high in sugar content. Fire ants bring the larvae back to the nest, and protect them through the pupal stage in exchange for feeding on the fluid. In &quot;Eurybia elvina&quot;, fire ants were observed to frequently construct soil shelters over later instars of larvae on inflorescences on which the larvae are found.

Fire ants nest in the soil, often near moist areas, such as river banks, pond shores, watered lawns, and highway shoulders. Usually, the nest will not be visible, as it will be built under objects such as timber, logs, rocks, or bricks. If no cover for nesting is available, dome-shaped mounds are constructed, but these are usually only found in open spaces, such as fields, parks, and lawns. These mounds can reach heights of , but can be even higher on heavier soils, standing at in height and in diameter. Colonies are founded by small groups of queens or single queens. Even if only one queen survives, within a month or so, the colony can expand to thousands of individuals. Some colonies may be polygynous (having multiple queens per nest).

Fire ants are resilient and can survive floods. During Hurricane Harvey in Texas in 2017, clumps of fire ants, known as rafts, were seen clumped together on the surface of the water. Each clump had as many as 100,000 individual ants, which formed a temporary structure until finding a new permanent home. Ants clumped in this way will recognize different fluid flow conditions and adapt their behavior accordingly to preserve the raft&#x27;s stability. 

Fire ants dig tunnels efficiently using about 30% of the population of the colony, thereby avoiding congestion in tunnels.

==Queens, males and workers==
===Queen===
Fire ant queens, the reproductive females in their colony, also are generally the largest. Their primary function is reproduction. Typically, a fire ant queen will seek to establish a new colony following a nuptial flight, wherein it will use its special venom to paralyze offending competitors, in the absence of workers for defense. Fire ant queens may live up to seven years and can produce up to 1,600 eggs per day, and colonies will have as many as 250,000 workers. The estimated potential life span is around 5 years and 10 months to 6 years and 9 months. Young, virgin fire ant queens have wings (as do male fire ants), but they often cut them off after mating. Occasionally, a queen will keep its wings after mating and through her first year.

===Males (drones)===
Male fire ants mate with queens during a nuptial flight. After a male has successfully inseminated a queen, he will not get accepted back to the mother colony, and will eventually die outside the nest.

===Workers===
The other roles in an ant colony are usually undertaken by workers. Fire ant workers are haphazardly divided into different size classes, namely minima, minor, media, and major workers. The major ants are known for their larger size and more powerful mandibles typically used in macerating and storing food items (i.e. as repletes), while smaller workers take care of regular tasks (the main tasks in a colony are caring for the eggs/larvae/pupae, cleaning the nest, and foraging for food). However, &quot;Solenopsis daguerrei&quot; colonies contain no workers, as they are considered social parasites.

==Invasive species==

Although most fire ant species do not bother people and are not invasive, &quot;Solenopsis invicta&quot;, known in the United States as the red imported fire ant (or RIFA), is an invasive pest in many areas of the world, including the United States, Australia, China and Taiwan. The RIFA was believed to have been accidentally introduced to these countries via shipping crates, particularly in the case of Australia.

In Australia, RIFA ants were first identified in the Port of Brisbane in 2001, although a strategic review of the Australian RIFA eradication program published in 2021 suggested that RIFA ants may have been present but undetected in Australia as early as 1992. As of November 2023, the invasion of fire ants is restricted to an area of 7000 km2 in South East Queensland that includes Brisbane, with the colonised area bordering the state of New South Wales (NSW), with incursions reported in northern NSW on a regular basis. Outside of this region, as of 2023, there have been seven other incursions that have had to be eradicated, with all incursions linked to ports and airports, including in Gladstone, the Port of Botany near Sydney (in 2014), and the Port of Fremantle, Western Australia. Elsewhere, fire ants have been frequently intercepted on incoming cargo in ports and airports across Australia. Of particular concern, Australian researchers predict that the entire country is able to provide suitable habitat for RIFA colonization, with the exception of highland Tasmania and the Snowy Mountains. In the 11-year time period between 2001 and 2022, the commonwealth and state governments of Australia spent a combined AU$644m in their attempts to eradicate RIFA ants. In 2015, the Australian National Red Imported Fire Ant Eradication Program (NRIFAEP) National Fire Ant Eradication Program was set up and received AU$411m of funding. For the time period of 2023-2027, funding of AU$593m has been agreed. Despite the funded plan and a degree of success in the eradication of RIFA not seen elsewhere in the world, some Australian experts warn that the government on a national and state level may be moving too slowly given the size of the threat.

They were believed to be in the Philippines, but they are most likely to be misidentified for &quot;Solenopsis geminata&quot; ants.

In the US, the FDA estimates that more than US$5 billion is spent annually on medical treatment, damage, and control in RIFA-infested areas. Furthermore, the ants cause approximately $750 million in damage annually to agricultural assets, including veterinarian bills and livestock loss, as well as crop loss. Over 40 million people live in RIFA-infested areas in the southeastern United States. It is estimated that 30–60% of the people living in fire ant-infested areas of the US are stung each year. RIFA are currently found mainly in warmer US states in the south-east of the country including Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, but extend to include parts of North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and California.

Since September 2004, Taiwan has been seriously affected by the red fire ant. The US, Taiwan and Australia all have ongoing national programs to control or eradicate the species, but with the exception of those in Australia, none have been especially effective. According to a study published in 2009, it took only seventy years for the lizards in parts of the United States to adapt to the ant&#x27;s presence; they now have longer legs and new behaviors that aid them in escaping from the danger.

&quot;Solenopsis invicta&quot; is the most famous species in this genus, especially in the US, however several other species are similarly dangerous and invasive, such as &quot;Solenopsis geminata&quot;, which has invaded most of the tropical countries, wreaking havoc in medical systems especially in unprepared countries and islands.

== Sting symptoms and treatment ==

The venom of fire ants is mainly (&gt;95%) composed of oily alkaloids structurally derived from piperidine (also known as solenopsins) mixed with a small amount of toxic proteins. Fire ant stings are painful, characterised by a local burning sensation, followed by urticaria. The sting site typically swells into a bump within hours, which can cause further pain and irritation, especially following several stings at the same place. The bump may develop into a white pustule within 24–36 hours which can become infected if scratched, but will spontaneously flatten within a few days if left alone. The pustules are obtrusive and uncomfortable while active and, if they become infected, may cause scarring. Some people may become allergic to the venom, and if untreated, may become increasingly sensitive to the point of experiencing anaphylaxis following fire ant stings, which requires emergency treatment. Management of an emergency visit due to anaphylaxis is recommended with the use of adrenaline. It has been demonstrated that, whilst pustule formation results from the injected venom alkaloids, allergy to fire ant stings is caused solely by venom allergenic proteins.

First aid for fire ant stings includes external treatments and oral medicines. There are also many home remedies of varying efficacy, including immediate application of a solution of half bleach and half water, or aloe vera gel – the latter of which is also often included in over-the-counter creams that also include medically tested and verified treatments. External, topical treatments include the anesthetic benzocaine, the antihistamine diphenhydramine, and the corticosteroid hydrocortisone. Antihistamines or topical corticosteroids may help reduce the itching and will generally benefit local sting reactions. Oral medicine include antihistamines. Severe allergic reactions to fire ant stings, including severe chest pain, nausea, severe sweating, loss of breath, serious swelling, and slurred speech can be fatal if not treated.

== Predators ==

Phorid flies, or Phoridae, are a large family of small, hump-backed flies somewhat smaller than vinegar flies; two species in this family (&quot;Pseudacteon tricuspis&quot; and &quot;Pseudacteon curvatus&quot;) are parasitoids of the red imported fire ant in its native range in South America. Some 110 species of the genus &quot;Pseudacteon&quot;, or ant-decapitating flies, have been described. Members of &quot;Pseudacteon&quot; reproduce by laying eggs in the thorax of the ant. The first instar larvae migrates to the head, then develops by feeding on the hemolymph, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. After about two weeks, they cause the ant&#x27;s head to fall off by releasing an enzyme that dissolves the membrane attaching the ant&#x27;s head to its body. The fly pupates in the detached head capsule, emerging two weeks later.

&quot;Pseudacteon&quot; flies appear to be important ecological constraints on &quot;Solenopsis&quot; species and they have been introduced throughout the southern United States, starting with Travis, Brazos, and Dallas counties in Texas, as well as south central Alabama, where the ants first entered North America.

The Venus flytrap, a carnivorous plant, is native only to North and South Carolina in the United States. About 33% of the prey of the Venus flytrap are ants of various species. They lure their prey with a sweet sap. Once the prey has entered the trap and within about three seconds of touching two or three &quot;trigger hairs&quot; on the surface of the trap, the leaf closes around the prey and digests it. The majority of ants that are captured include non-native RIFAs, and three other species of ants. Other carnivorous plants, such as sundews (&quot;Drosera&quot;) and various kinds of pitcher plants also trap many ants.

Key natural enemies of fire ants also include other ant species which will attack prospective queens during the nest founding period, when there is an absence of workers to defend the emergent colony. Frequent competitors of fire ant founding queens include other &quot;Solenopsis&quot; thief ant species, and some invasive pest species, such as the tawny crazy ant, and the black crazy ant.

A number of entomopathogenic fungi are also natural enemies of fire ants, such as &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot; and &quot;Metarhizium anisopliae&quot;&quot;.&quot; The latter is commercially available for the biological control (as an alternative to conventional pesticides) of various pest insects, and a new proposed technology has increased its shelf life and efficiency against fire ants.

==Species==

The genus &quot;Solenopsis&quot; contains over 200 species. Not all species included in the genus are known as fire ants, but most are small slow-moving ants which are unable to sting, called thief ants. &quot;True&quot; fire ants are but a group of about 20 species of &quot;Solenopsis&quot; which are larger, and will viciously sting in swarms whenever disturbed. Some of the most studied species include:

* &quot;Solenopsis invicta&quot; 
* &quot;Solenopsis richteri&quot; 
* &quot;Solenopsis saevissima&quot; 
* &quot;Solenopsis silvestrii&quot; 
* &quot;Solenopsis solenopsidis&quot; 
* &quot;Solenopsis xyloni&quot; 
* &quot;Solenopsis geminata&quot;

<text>Adam Jared Brody (born December 15, 1979) is an American actor. His breakout role was as Seth Cohen on the Fox television series &quot;The O.C.&quot; (2003–2007). Brody appeared in films including &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot; (2005), &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot; (2005), &quot;In the Land of Women&quot; (2007), and &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s Body&quot; (2009). In the 2010s, Brody had supporting roles in comedies including &quot;Seeking a Friend for the End of the World&quot; (2012) and &quot;Sleeping with Other People&quot; (2015), and dramatic films such as &quot;Lovelace&quot; (2013). He appeared in a number of television series during this time, and starred in and produced the television series &quot;StartUp&quot; (2016–2018).

Brody has also appeared in the DC superhero film &quot;Shazam!&quot; (2019) and its sequel &quot;Shazam! Fury of the Gods&quot; (2023), and in the thriller films &quot;Ready or Not&quot; (2019) and &quot;Promising Young Woman&quot; (2020). He also starred in the mystery film &quot;The Kid Detective&quot; (2020) and the Hulu miniseries &quot;Fleishman Is in Trouble&quot; (2022). For his performance as a rabbi in the Netflix romantic comedy series &quot;Nobody Wants This&quot; (2024), he earned a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.

==Early life==
Brody was born in San Diego, California, to Valerie Jill (née Siefman), a graphic artist, and Mark Alan Brody, an attorney. He has younger twin brothers, Sean and Matthew (born 1985). His parents, both Jewish, are originally from Detroit. Brody had a bar mitzvah ceremony and grew up celebrating Jewish holidays.

Brody grew up in suburban San Diego, where he attended Wangenheim Middle School and Scripps Ranch High School and received &quot;poor grades&quot;. He spent much of his time surfing, admitting that he &quot;pretty much lived at the beach&quot;.

Brody attended community college at MiraCosta College for one year, dropping out at the age of 19; he then moved to Hollywood to become an actor.

==Acting career==

After a year of training and auditioning, Brody landed the role of Barry Williams in the television film &quot;Growing Up Brady&quot; (2000) and appeared in the Canadian comedy series &quot;The Sausage Factory&quot;. In 2001, he had a minor role in &quot;American Pie 2&quot;. Brody&#x27;s first major television role came in 2002, when he was cast in a recurring role on the third season of the comedy-drama series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; as Dave Rygalski, Lane&#x27;s bandmate and love interest.

In 2003, Brody appeared in the movie &quot;Grind&quot; and the music video for &quot;Too Bad About Your Girl&quot; by the Donnas. That year, he was cast in his breakout role as Seth Cohen on the teen drama series &quot;The O.C.&quot;, where he reportedly improvised some of the character&#x27;s comedic dialogue. The role turned him into a teen idol, with the character described by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;TV&#x27;s sexiest geek&quot; and by &quot;Time&quot; as having &quot;redefined&quot; the screen persona of &quot;unapologetic&quot; nerdiness. Brody was the first male on the cover of &quot;Elle Girl&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;4/071&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Brody had a supporting role in the film &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;, and played a Hollywood studio assistant in the film adaptation of &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot; (2006). His next film role was in the romantic comedy &quot;In the Land of Women&quot; (2007), as a writer who returns to his mother&#x27;s Michigan hometown to take care of his sick grandmother. He did not have to audition for the part, but was almost unable to appear in the film because of scheduling conflicts with the second season of &quot;The O.C.&quot;; the film&#x27;s director pushed filming back eight months because he wanted Brody to star. &quot;The O.C.&quot; ended its run in 2007 after four seasons. Brody had said that he was &quot;not unhappy&quot; with the show&#x27;s cancellation, and that although he was &quot;fortunate&quot; to be on a successful series, he was also glad to &quot;not be on it for 10 years&quot;.

After the end of &quot;The O.C.&quot; run, Brody turned to a full-time film career. In 2007, he appeared in supporting roles in the films &quot;Smiley Face&quot; and &quot;The Ten&quot;. In 2009, he starred in Boaz Yakin&#x27;s drama &quot;Death in Love&quot; and in Diablo Cody&#x27;s horror film &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s Body&quot;. In 2010, he appeared in Kevin Smith&#x27;s film &quot;Cop Out&quot;, and then in &quot;The Romantics&quot;. In July 2010, it was announced that he had worked play Deputy Ross Hoss in &quot;Scream 4&quot;, which was released in April 2011.
