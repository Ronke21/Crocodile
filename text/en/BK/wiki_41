<text>North River () is an alternative name for the southernmost portion of the Hudson River in the vicinity of New York City and northeastern New Jersey in the United States.

==History==

===Name===

In the early 17th century, the entire watercourse was named the North River (Dutch: Noort Rivier&quot;) by the Dutch colonial empire; by the early 18th century, the term fell out of general use for most of the river&#x27;s 300+ mile course. The name remains in limited use among local mariners and others and on some nautical charts and maps. The term is also used to describe infrastructure on and under the river, including the North River piers, North River Tunnels, and Riverbank State Park.

The origin of the name North River is generally attributed to the Dutch. In describing the major rivers in the New Netherland colony, they called the present-day Hudson River the &quot;North River&quot;, the present-day Connecticut River the &quot;Fresh River&quot;, and the Delaware River the &quot;South River&quot;. Another theory is that the North River and East River were so named for the direction of travel they permitted once having entered the Upper New York Bay.

At various times, North River has referred to:

* The entire Hudson River
* The approximately 160-mile portion of the Hudson below its confluence with the Mohawk River, which is under tidal influence
* The portion of it running between Manhattan and New Jersey
* The length flowing between Lower Manhattan and Hudson County, New Jersey.

The river&#x27;s history is strongly connected to the shipping industry in the Port of New York and New Jersey, which shifted primarily to Port Newark in the mid-20th century due to the construction of the Holland Tunnel and other river crossings and the advent of containerization. Throughout this multi-century history, the name for the lower portion of the river has remained interchangeable with both North River and Hudson River used to describe it.

===19th century===
In 1808, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin issued a report of proposed locations for transportation and communication internal improvements of national importance. The North River figured prominently among his proposals as the best route toward western and northern lands; similar routes were chosen for the Erie Canal and other early canals built by the New York state.

Gallatin noted the following in reference to the North and Hudson Rivers, writing:

===20th century===
In 1909, two tunnels were under construction: one was called the North River Tunnels, the other, the Hudson Tubes. That year the Hudson–Fulton Celebration was held, commemorating Henry Hudson, the first European to record navigating the river, and Robert Fulton, the first man to use a paddle steamer in America, named the &quot;North River Steamboat&quot;, to sail up it, leading to controversy over what the waterway should be called.

Much of the shoreline previously used for maritime, rail, and industrial activities has given way to recreational promenades and piers. On the Hudson Waterfront in New Jersey, the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway runs for about 18 miles. In Manhattan, the Hudson River Park runs from Battery Park to 59th Street.

==North River on maps==

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s current charts call the lower river the &quot;Hudson&quot;, and the United States Geological Survey lists &quot;North River&quot; as an alternative name of the Hudson River without qualifying it as any particular portion of the river.

Hagstrom Maps, formerly the leading mapmaker in the New York metropolitan area and known for occasional quirky and anachronistic names, features, and artifacts on their maps, has labeled all or part of the Hudson adjacent to Manhattan as &quot;North River&quot; on several of its products. For instance, on a 1997 Hagstrom &quot;Map of Manhattan&quot;, the stretch of river between Hudson County, New Jersey, and Lower Manhattan, roughly corresponding to the location of the North River piers, was labeled &quot;North River&quot;, with the label &quot;Hudson River&quot; used above Midtown Manhattan.

On a 2000 map of &quot;Northern Approaches to New York City&quot; included in Hagstrom&#x27;s &quot;New York [State] Road Map&quot;, the entire river adjacent to Manhattan was labeled &quot;Hudson River (North River)&quot; with the river further north at Tappan Zee labeled the &quot;Hudson River&quot;.

== North River piers ==
Piers along the Hudson shore of Manhattan were formerly used for shipping and berthing ocean-going ships. In shipping notices, they were designated as, for example, &quot;Pier 14, North River&quot;. As with the river, the name &quot;North River piers&quot; has largely been supplanted by &quot;Hudson River piers&quot;, or just by a pier and number, e.g., &quot;Pier 54&quot;. Pier 40 is located at Houston Street, and the numbering of the piers to the north correspond to the nearest numbered street plus 40 – thus, for example, North River Pier 86 is at West 46th Street.

Most of the piers that once existed in lower Manhattan fell into disuse or were destroyed in the last half of the 20th century. The remaining piers are Pier A at the Battery and piers ranging from Pier 25 at North Moore Street to Pier 99 at 59th Street. Many of these piers and the waterfront between them are part of the Hudson River Park which stretches from 59th Street to the Battery. The park, a joint project between New York City and New York State commenced in 1998, consists of several non-contiguous parcels of land and piers totaling , plus another of the river itself. Several piers were rebuilt for adaptive re-use as part of the park project, with approximately 70% of the planned work complete by 2011.

=== Status ===

* Pier A is a designated national and New York City landmark. The building on the pier dates to 1886, and was used by the city&#x27;s Department of Docks, Harbor Police, and was later a fireboat station. The pier was closed and renovated from 1992 to November 2014, after which it reopened as a restaurant.
* What little remained of Piers 1 through 21 were buried under landfill from the World Trade Center construction project in 1973 and turned into Battery Park City.
*Pier 25 is a sports and docking facility at the foot of North Moore Street with a mini golf course.
*Pier 26 was rebuilt over 2008–2009 and is home to a new park designed by OLIN and Rafael Viñoly and opened in September 2020, featuring a sports court and an engineered wetland.
*Pier 34, at Canal Street, contains a ventilation shaft for the Holland Tunnel.
*Pier 40, at Houston Street, was built as a terminal for the Holland America Line in 1962, and now contains various playing fields, long-term parking spaces and the Trapeze School of New York on the roof (during the summer).
*The term &quot;Christopher Street Pier&quot; usually refers specifically to Pier 45 opposite West 10th Street in Greenwich Village. However, it refers to three other piers as well, between Piers 42–51. Pier 51 houses a water-themed playground, part of Hudson River Park.
*Piers 52 and 53, also known as Gansevoort Peninsula, were formerly a New York City Department of Sanitation facility used for shipping trash out of Manhattan. They are being converted into a public park, expected to be complete in 2023. Also at the end of Pier 53 is the FDNY&#x27;s Marine 1 fireboat facility, occupying a new building completed in 2011.
*Pier 54 and Pier 55, part of Hudson River Park since its creation in 1998, was closed in 2011 when it was deemed structurally unsound. Plans were unveiled in November 2014 for a new park designed by Heatherwick Studio and costing $130 million. The project was temporarily canceled in 2017 after costs had grown to $250 million, but was later revived as part of an agreement to complete the remainder of Hudson River Park. The new park, dubbed &quot;Little Island,&quot; took the place of the now-dismantled Piers 54 and 55, and opened in May 2021.
*Pier 57, at 15th Street and 11th Avenue, formerly served as a terminal for shipping and storage of cargo for the Grace Line. Between 1969 and 2003, Pier 57 housed the Hudson Pier Bus Depot for the New York City Transit Authority. After its abandonment, plans created in 2009 called for an improved pier design for commercial use, initially dubbed the SuperPier by its developer. The renovated pier reopened to the public in April 2022, featuring office space for Google, a food hall, and a rooftop park.
*Piers 59–62 are used as Chelsea Piers, which were originally a passenger ship terminal in the early 1900s that was used by the RMS Lusitania and was the destination of the RMS Titanic. The Chelsea Piers Sports &amp; Entertainment Complex opened at the site in 1995.
*Pier 63 was the location of a Pavonia Ferry terminal that opened in 1869. The terminal was demolished in 1942, and the pier then housed a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad transfer barge. In the late 1980s, boat enthusiast John Krevey converted an old railroad barge on the Hudson River to a floating jetty.
*Pier 66 is part of Hudson River Park, It is located at 26th Street and is used for sailing and paddle sports.
*Pier 76, formerly the NYPD impound lot, was reopened by the Hudson River Park Trust on June 9, 2021 as a park and cultural space.
*Pier 78 is the only Hudson River pier that is privately owned, and is used for sightseeing cruises.
*Pier 79 is the West Midtown Ferry Terminal used by NY Waterway and NYC Ferry. Pier 79 connects to an Art Deco style ventilation shaft for the Lincoln Tunnel.
*Pier 81 is site of North River Lobster and World Yacht
*Pier 83 is used by Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises. 
*Pier 84 served as a concert venue from the former Schaefer Music Festival. The pier also houses a water-themed playground within Hudson River Park, is a stop for New York Water Taxi, and has a bicycle rental shop and other businesses serving primarily tourists.
*Pier 86 at West 46th Street is home to the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum, the centerpiece of which is the USS &quot;Intrepid&quot;, an aircraft carrier that served from World War II to the Vietnam War. This pier once served as the passenger ship terminal for the United States Lines.
*Piers 88–92 are part of the Manhattan Cruise Terminal, used by numerous modern cruise ships and ocean liners. In 1942, the USS &quot;Lafayette&quot; (formerly SS &quot;Normandie&quot;) caught fire at Pier 88, remaining capsized there for a year. Pier 92 was subsequently used as an exhibition space, but closed in 2019 after the pier was found to be unsafe.
*Pier 94 was formerly also part of the Passenger Ship Terminal, and until 2020 housed the &quot;UnConvention Center&quot;, the second-largest exhibition hall in New York City. As of 2023, it is slated to be redeveloped into a film studio.
*Pier 96 is part of Hudson River Park. It is the home of Manhattan Community Boathouse, an all-volunteer non-profit organization that offers free kayaking to the public each summer.
*Pier 97 is part of Hudson River Park. It was until 1975 the home of the Swedish American Line passenger ship terminal. The terminal was demolished some time after 1984 and the pier has since been used for various purposes, including many years as a Sanitation Department parking lot and a brief period as a live event venue sponsored by JBL and Live Nation. In November 2019, it was announced that the pier would be converted into a park, with construction expected to start in September 2020. As of September 2020, the pier is now expected to reopen in March 2024.
* Pier 98 is used for Con Edison employee car parking, a training facility and delivery by barge and storage of fuel oil.
* Pier 99 houses the West 59th Street Marine Transfer Station, used by the New York City Sanitation Department.
* Pier I and most of Riverside Park South were originally part of the abandoned Penn Central railyard between 59th and 72nd Streets. These lettered piers were built at a 55-degree angle to the shore to facilitate the transfer of rail cars from their tracks to a waiting barge. Pier I is the only remaining rail pier. The 69th Street Transfer Bridge of the New York Central Railroad is still extant and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2003.

==Railroads and ferries==

Prior to the opening of the North River Tunnels and the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad tubes in the early 1900s, passengers and freight were required to cross the river for travel to points east. This led to an extensive network of intermodal terminals, railyards, ferry slips, docks, barges, and carfloats. The west shore of the river from the mid 19th to the mid 20th century was home to expansive facilities operated by competing railroads. Most are now gone, allowing for public access to the waterfront at piers, parks, promenades and marinas along the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway. New ferry slips and terminals exclusively for pedestrian use have been built.
* Communipaw Terminal was in operation from 1864 to 1967. It was owned by the Central Railroad of New Jersey and also hosted trains of the Baltimore and Ohio and the Reading Company. The CRRNJ&#x27;s main ferry ran to pier 11 at Liberty Street. The historic landmark is now a major feature of Liberty State Park and ferry terminal for service to Ellis Island and Liberty Island. The terminal is adjacent to the Big Basin of the Morris Canal (used to ship anthracite from the mines of Pennsylvania) which entered the harbor at the river&#x27;s mouth.
* Exchange Place station was the location of the first waterfront terminal in 1834, and its larger successor was used until 1961. Regular ferry service from Paulus Hook had begun in the early Dutch colonial period. The original station was built by the New Jersey Railroad to meet the world&#x27;s first steam ferry service which had been initiated in 1812 by Robert Fulton and Robert Livingston. During the Pennsylvania Railroad era in the 20th century the station was called Exchange Place, local nomenclature for the streetcar terminus and Hudson and Manhattan Railroad tube station. The main ferry ran to Cortlandt Street. The district is now sometimes known as &quot;Wall Street West&quot; due to the concentration of financial concerns and skyscrapers located there. Today ferry service travels to Battery Park City Ferry Terminal, Pier 11 at Wall Street, and the West Midtown Ferry Terminal.
* Pavonia Terminal operated from 1861 to 1958. The terminal, completed in 1889 by the Erie Railroad, was at the end of the Long Dock which extended into the partially landfilled Harsimus Cove. The Jersey City Terminal was also used by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway. It was named after the seventeenth century New Netherland settlement of Pavonia. Ferry service began in the 1840s. The main Pavonia Ferry later ran to Chambers Street and 23rd Street. The Erie&#x27;s Pavonia trains were moved to Hoboken Terminal between 1956 and 1958, and the ferries and terminal abandoned. The terminal and yards have now been developed into the residential and commercial district of Newport, Jersey City.
* Hoboken Terminal is the last of the Hudson River terminals still in use and is now operated by NJ Transit. Regular ferry service was started in 1834 by John Stevens. Train service began in 1863 by the Morris and Essex Railroad and was taken over by Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, which built the terminal in 1908. The DL&amp;W later merged with the Erie to create the Erie Lackawanna Railway which, after becoming part of Conrail, operated until the state takeover in the 1970s. The main routes of the Hoboken Ferry ran to Barclay Street, Christopher Street and 23rd Street; these ferries operated until 1967. Today NY Waterway ferries travel to the Battery Park City Ferry Terminal, Pier 11 at Wall Street and the West Midtown Ferry Terminal.
* Weehawken Terminal operated from 1884 to 1959 as the terminus for New York Central Railroad&#x27;s West Shore Railroad division as well as for the New York, Ontario and Western Railway. The extensive Weehawken Yards also handled freight for the Erie Railroad with the New Jersey Junction Railroad. The New York Central Railroad 69th Street Transfer Bridge is now a historic site. The main Weehawken Ferry travelled directly across the river to 42nd Street and for a time was part of route of the Lincoln Highway. Other ferries included those to 14th Street and Cortland Street. The original tunnel under Bergen Hill is now used by the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail and contains the Bergenline Avenue station. Ferry service is now provided from Weehawken Port Imperial to the West Midtown Ferry Terminal, Battery Park City Ferry Terminal, and Wall Street.
* The New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway terminus in Shadyside, Edgewater, was opened in 1894 for the shipment of coal and other products. This led to extensive landfilling and industrial growth including plants of Hess Oil and Chemical, Lever Brothers, Alcoa, and the Ford Motor Company. Many workers from Manhattan used the ferry from 125th Street to reach their jobs. The factories of Edgewater have been demolished, the brownfields redeveloped for residential, retail, and recreational uses. The ferry now travels from Edgewater Landing to West Midtown Ferry Terminal.

==Fixed crossings==
The last crossing to be built was the south tube of the Lincoln Tunnel in 1957, but in 1962, another deck was added to the George Washington Bridge. Since 2003, various proposals have been made to add a new train line. This includes an extension of the completed 7 Subway Extension, the canceled Access to the Region&#x27;s Core, and the ongoing Gateway Program.

<doc id="381681" wikidata="Q216941" url="?curid=381681" title="Xi River">
<text>The Xi River (; ) or Si-Kiang is the western tributary of the Pearl River in southern China. It is formed by the confluence of the Gui and Xun Rivers in Wuzhou, Guangxi. It originates from the eastern foot of the Maxiong Mountain in Qujing City, Yunnan Province. Then it flows east through Guangdong, and enters the Pearl River Delta just east of the Lingyang Gorge in Zhaoqing. The main branch of the Xi River flows southeast through the delta entering the South China Sea at Modao Men, just west of Macau. The major cities along the Xi include Wuzhou, Zhaoqing, and Jiangmen.

The other two main tributaries of Pearl River are the Dong River (literally, the East River) and Bei River (the Northern River). As for other functions, it plays a vital role in carbon storage and transport in Southern China. The Xi River is facing some ecological challenges such as drought, invasive species, and pollution.

== Xi River system ==
The basin of the Xi River ranges from eastern Yunnan Province to southern Guangdong Province with a humid subtropical or tropical monsoon climate. The Xi River is navigable for its entire length. It is a commercial waterway of southern China, and links the delta cities to the interior. Over two thousand years ago, the Lingqu Canal was dug, connecting the Xi River basin (the Li River, which is a tributary of the Gui River) with the Xiang River, which flows into the Yangtze, thus providing a continuous waterway from the Pearl River Delta to the Yangtze Valley. The Xi River is rich in water conservancy and water resources, providing significant contributions to agricultural irrigation, river transportation, and power generation in coastal areas.

The Xi River is the largest of the Pearl&#x27;s tributaries. Its volume of flow is second in China only to that of the Yangtze River, and it supplies water to many places in Guangxi, Guangdong and Macau. The greater Xi River is also one of China&#x27;s longest. Existing in many segments it extends for :
*Nanpan River: 
*Hongshui River: 
*Qian River: 
*Xun River: 
*Xi River (including main branch to the sea): 

== Major cities along the river ==
* Wuzhou
* Zhaoqing
* Foshan (Gaoming District)
* Heshan
* Jiangmen
* Zhongshan
* Zhuhai

== River Ecology ==
Rivers are a significant storage and transport system for both organic and inorganic carbon. The Xi River is an important source of atmospheric carbon dioxide in Southern China, with carbon inputs coming mainly from the river&#x27;s headwater Nanpan and Beipan rivers. In the Beipan River, carbon inputs come from the oxidation of organic carbon and the coal industry along the river. In the Nanpan River, carbon inputs come mainly from soil and organic detritus.

== Environmental Issues ==

=== Drought ===
The Xi River basin has historically experienced droughts, which are worsening due to climate change and rapid urbanization along with many parts of the river. This increase in population is straining water resources. The climate of the watershed is subtropical to tropical monsoon, with 80% of precipitation falling between April and September. This extreme variation in yearly precipitation patterns exacerbates drought issues. Climate change is predicted to cause a significant decrease in average, highest, and lowest river flows, with average flow droppings anywhere from 4 to 49%. Increasing frequency and severity lead the meteorological and hydrological droughts.

=== Invasive species ===
Invasive or non-native species are an issue in rivers in southern China, including the Xi River. Southern China rears the majority of non-native species in aquaculture. These species are mainly introduced from aquaculture, and may predate or outcompete native species. Most introduced species are omnivores, including the Nile tilapia, the most common non-native species in southern China rivers.

=== Pollution ===
Many commercial fish species in the Xi River and the encompassing Pearl River watershed have been contaminated with significant amounts of Bisphenol A, common in plastics manufacturing. Bisphenol A is a chemical that can be harmful to the endocrine system of fish and humans.

== Protection ==
In order to protect the Xi River, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region government issued a notice prohibiting new construction projects and migration of people within the land occupied and inundated areas of the Xi River mainstream control project in Guangxi. Besides, the protection measures include: promulgated a fishing ban, wetland park protection, develop green recycling and low-carbon economic, the innovation of ecological and environmental protection cooperation mechanism and Xi River Basin Nature Reserve construction management.

<doc id="381686" wikidata="Q1563878" url="?curid=381686" title="Vanden Plas">
<text>Vanden Plas is the name of coachbuilders who produced bodies for specialist and up-market automobile manufacturers. Latterly the name became a top-end luxury model designation for cars from subsidiaries of British Leyland and the Rover Group, being last used in 2009 to denote the top-luxury version of the Jaguar XJ (X350).

==Belgium and England==

===Batched and bespoke coachwork===
The business began in 1870 in Brussels, Belgium, initially making axles later producing horse-drawn carriages. It was founded by Guillaume van den Plas, a blacksmith, and his three sons, Antoine, Henri and Willy, who later set up a branch in Paris. In 1884 they moved from Brussels to Antwerp. With increased business they opened a branch in Brussels again in 1890. By 1900, they worked with De Dion Bouton, Berlier, Germain and Packard. By 1908 Carrosserie Van den Plas had a workforce of 400 men producing 300 special bodies a year, and that soon increased to over 750. The French branch ceased production in 1934 while the Belgian business was active until 1949.

The coachbuilder&#x27;s name first appeared in the United Kingdom in 1906 when Métallurgique cars were imported with Carrosserie Van den Plas coachwork. The first Vanden Plas company in England was established by Warwick Wright (now Peugeot dealers) in 1913, building bodies under license from Carrosserie Van den Plas Belgium.

During the First World War UK activities were switched to aircraft production, and the UK business was bought by The Aircraft Manufacturing Company which was based at Hendon near London. In 1917, Vanden Plas (1917) Ltd. was incorporated. After the war it seems to have been a struggle to get back into coachbuilding and in 1922 that company was placed in receivership. The exclusive UK naming rights seem to have been lost, because in the early 1920s the Belgian firm was exhibiting at the London Motor Show alongside the British business. In 1923 the rights to the name and the goodwill were purchased by the Fox brothers, who incorporated Vanden Plas (England) 1923 Limited. They moved the business from Hendon to Kingsbury and built on the contacts that had been made with Bentley. Between 1924 and 1931, when Bentley failed, Vanden Plas built the bodies for more than 700 of their chassis.

In the 1930s the company became less dependent on one car maker, and supplied coachwork to such as Alvis, Armstrong Siddeley, Bentley, Daimler, Lagonda, Rolls-Royce and Talbot. The company also updated its production methods and took to making small batches of similar bodies. With the outbreak of war in 1939, coachbuilding stopped and the company returned to aircraft work, manufacturing the wooden framework for the de Havilland Mosquito, one of the most successful aircraft of the Second World War. After the war, the company continued its association with de Havilland, and manufactured parts for the Vampire jet fighter.

===Production limousines===

====Princess====

With peace in 1945, the company looked to restart its old business when a new customer came along. Austin wanted to market a chauffeur-driven version of its in-house-built large 4-litre Rolls-Royce-size A110 Sheerline luxury car and approached Vanden Plas. Vanden Plas became a subsidiary of the Austin Motor Company in 1946 and produced Austin&#x27;s A120 Princess model on the Austin Sheerline chassis.

From 1958, this began to involve chassis assembly and Austin, now BMC, recognised Vanden Plas as a motor manufacturer in its own right by dropping Austin from the name and so enabled Nuffield dealers to sell the Princess. In 1960, the Princess became the Vanden Plas Princess. 
====Daimler DS 420====

Austin was joined in BMC by Jaguar with its new subsidiary Daimler. Production of Princess limousines ended in 1968 when they were replaced with Daimler DS420 limousines (Jaguar had acquired Daimler in 1960) built by Vanden Plas on a lengthened Jaguar Mark X platform. The DS420 was produced at the Kingsbury Lane Vanden Plas factory until it closed in November 1979.

The British Leyland board decided in 1967 there were insufficient funds for marketing the Daimler brand in North America, as well as Jaguar. From that point, Vanden Plas was used in North America instead of Daimler on Jaguar&#x27;s top luxury models. Ownership of the Vanden Plas name stayed with the Rover Group, so when Jaguar was sold off, it was obliged to stop using Vanden Plas in the United Kingdom, although it continued to do so in America. Within the UK a Daimler Double-Six Vanden Plas became a plain Daimler Double-Six.
==Badge engineering==

Also in 1957/8, Vanden Plas were asked by Leonard Lord to add luxury fittings to a batch of Austin A105 Westminster cars, beginning the practice of using the company&#x27;s skills and name for badge-engineered (and modified) luxury versions of many of the BMC (and later British Leyland (BL)) cars such as the 1100/1300 range and the Allegro (known as the Vanden Plas 1500, 1.5 &amp; 1.7 from 1975 to 1980). The Vanden Plas works in Kingsbury, North London closed in 1979 and the marque switched to Abingdon.

From 1982 to 1989, Austin Rover made upmarket Vanden Plas models within its Metro, Maestro, Montego and Rover SD1 and SD3 ranges.

The name is also used in North America on Jaguar cars otherwise branded Daimler in other markets between 1982-2008.

In 1992, a Japanese company recreated the Vanden Plas 1100/1300 look on the Nissan Micra K11. This involved replicating the front and rear of the Vanden Plas, complete with two tone paint scheme as sported by the original model in the 1960s.

The last UK market British car to bear the Vanden Plas name was the Rover 75 at the beginning of the 21st century.

==China==
The rights to the design of the Rover 75 cars and the MG Group (which had formerly been MG Rover) were purchased by a Chinese firm, Nanjing Automobile. Ford purchased the Rover name from the Rover Group&#x27;s previous owner BMW to protect the Land Rover brand from Shanghai Automotive, who wanted the Rover name for their 75-based car (Ford was at this time owner of Land Rover and Jaguar). The Vanden Plas name (for outside North America) and many other Leyland names were purchased by Nanjing Automobile.

<doc id="381690" wikidata="Q1925813" url="?curid=381690" title="Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich was a metropolitan borough in the County of London between 1900 and 1965. It bordered the boroughs of Woolwich, Lewisham and Deptford and, across the River Thames, the borough of Poplar and the County Borough of West Ham in Essex. Within the area of the borough were the Royal Naval College (now the National Maritime Museum), the Royal Observatory and Greenwich Park.

The borough was abolished in 1965, and its area was merged with that of the borough of Woolwich to form the London Borough of Greenwich within the new ceremonial county of Greater London.

==Formation and boundaries==
The borough was formed from four civil parishes: Charlton-next-Woolwich, Deptford St Nicholas, Greenwich and Kidbrooke. In 1901 Charlton-next-Woolwich and Kidbrooke were merged to form Charlton and Kidbrooke. In 1930 the remaining three civil parishes were combined into a single civil parish called Borough of Greenwich, which was conterminous with the metropolitan borough.

Previous to the borough&#x27;s formation it had been administered by two separate local bodies: Greenwich District Board of Works and Lee District Board of Works.

==Population and area==
The borough covered . The population in each decennial census was:

Constituent parishes 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900–1961
==Politics==

The borough was divided into eight wards for elections: Charlton &amp; Kidbrooke, Marsh, North West, North, South East, South, St Nicholas Deptford and West.

===Borough council===
Metropolitan borough councils elections were held triennially. The first election to the borough council was held on 1 November 1900. The result was a majority for the pro-Conservative Moderates, who had 16 councillors elected. The opposition was formed by the Progressives with 8 seats. At the next election in 1903 Moderates held control with the support of 2 Independent Conservative councillors. By the time of the 1906 election, the Conservatives contested the elections throughout London under the Municipal Reform label. The Municipal Reformers held the council with 21 seats to 5 Progressives and 4 Independents. They held the council at the 1909 and 1912 elections: 1909 saw the first Socialist councillor elected to the council. Due to World War I, the next council election was not held until 1919. The Labour Party took control of the borough, with 20 seats to 10 for the Municipal Reform Party. Three years later the position was reversed, with Municipal Reformers retaking control with 22 seats to Labour&#x27;s 11. At the 1925 election the Municipal Reform and Labour parties both took 15 seats, and the borough council was consequently under no overall control. The same party composition was returned at the 1928 and 1931 elections. Labour subsequently gained control, which they held at the 1934 election. Labour held the borough at the 1937 election. Elections were again suspended during the Second World War, the next contest being in 1945: Labour held the borough. Elections to boroughs due in November 1948 were postponed to May 1949 to coincide with those for county councils. The Conservative Party contested the elections in the place of the Municipal Reformers. Labour held the council at this and all later elections to the metropolitan borough council, with the Conservatives forming the only other grouping. The last election to the council was held on 10 May 1962, when Labour gained 29 seats to 6 for the Conservatives.

===Parliamentary constituency===
A parliamentary borough of Greenwich had been formed by the Reform Act 1832. In 1918 the boundaries were realigned to correspond to the metropolitan borough.

==Coat of arms==
The borough council was granted a coat of arms by the College of Arms on 15 July 1903. The central band bearing an hour-glass represented the Greenwich Meridian and the surrounding stars the Royal Observatory. The crest above the shield was an ancient ship and crossed anchors, standing for the connections of Greenwich with the Royal Navy. The Latin motto was &quot;Tempore utimur&quot; or &quot;We use time&quot;: a reference to Greenwich Mean Time.

Some charges from these arms were taken over for the arms of the London Borough of Greenwich in 1965 and in 2012 for the new coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich.

==Town Halls==
West Greenwich House was built in 1876 and served as headquarters for the Greenwich District Board of Works before it was inherited by the new Borough Council in 1900. When built it had a dome and lantern above the parapet. It served as the Town Hall until 1939 after which it housed other council offices. Today it thrives as the West Greenwich Community and Arts Centre; the building was recently restored and refurbished.

In 1939, a new and much larger Greenwich Town Hall and Borough Hall were built on the corner of Greenwich High Road and Royal Hill in the Art Deco style. When the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich was merged into the London Borough of Greenwich in the 1960s, Woolwich Town Hall was used as the headquarters for the new larger borough instead. The Town Hall and Borough Hall buildings are now occupied by GSM London and a dance centre (Greenwich Dance) respectively.

<doc id="381696" wikidata="Q1925805" url="?curid=381696" title="Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea was a metropolitan borough of the County of London between 1900 and 1965. It was created by the London Government Act 1899 from most of the ancient parish of Chelsea. Following the London Government Act 1963, it was amalgamated with the Royal Borough of Kensington in 1965 to form the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

== Ecclesiastical parish ==
The ancient parish was originally dedicated to All Saints, but by the late 17th century it had been rededicated to St Luke. It was in the Diocese of London. In 1824 a new parish church was built in the centre of the parish, it was also dedicated to St Luke and the original parish church became a chapel-at-ease known as All Saints, Chelsea or Chelsea Old Church. From 1831, as the population of Chelsea increased, a number of new parishes were formed:
* Holy Trinity, Upper Chelsea in 1831
* St Saviour, Upper Chelsea in 1840
* St Jude, Upper Chelsea in 1844, (merged into Holy Trinity, Upper Chelsea in 1892)
* All Saints, Chelsea (Chelsea Old Church) voluntarily took care of certain streets from 1855, became a separate parish in 1951
* Park Chapel, Chelsea Park in c.1855, (renamed Emmanuel, Chelsea Park in 1906; then St Andrew, Chelsea Park in 1912)
* St Simon Zelotes, Upper Chelsea in 1859
* Christ Church, Chelsea in 1860
* St John, Chelsea World&#x27;s End in 1877

In the detached part of Chelsea parish, around the hamlet of Kensal Green (Kensal Town), a number of new parishes were also formed:
* St John the Evangelist, Kensal Green in 1845 &quot;with parts of Kensington, Paddington, Hammersmith and Willesden&quot;
* St Luke the Evangelist, Kensal Green in 1877 &quot;with parts of Holy Trinity, Kilburn&quot; 
* St Jude, Kensal Green in 1879

==Population and area==
The area of the borough was , once Kensal Town was transferred to Kensington and Paddington. The borough&#x27;s only railway station was Chelsea &amp; Fulham, on the West London Line, which closed in 1940. The borough&#x27;s only tube station was Sloane Square.

The population recorded in the Census was:

Chelsea Vestry 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900–1961
==Coat of arms==
The borough was granted a coat of arms by the College of Arms on 28 February 1903. The blazon was:
:&quot;Gules within a cross voided or a crozier in pale of the last in the first quarter a winged bull statant in the second a lion rampant reguardant both argent in the third a sword point downwards proper pomel and hilt gold between two boars&#x27; heads couped at the neck of the third and in the fourth a stag&#x27;s head caboshed of the second.&quot;
The winged bull is the symbol of St Luke, patron saint of Chelsea (St Luke&#x27;s parish church is just off the King&#x27;s Road). The other emblems referred to various holders of the manor over the centuries: the crozier for Westminster Abbey, the lion for Earl Cadogan (first mayor of the borough), the boars&#x27; heads and sword for the Sloane family and the stag&#x27;s head for the Stanley family.

The motto was &quot;Nisi dominus frustra&quot; or &quot;It is vain without the Lord&quot;.

The fourfold division of the shield was a design favoured by Albert Woods, Garter King of Arms for municipal grants: other examples in London included those of the metropolitan boroughs of Bermondsey, Camberwell, Islington, Kensington and Southwark.
==Politics==

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; as such the incorporated vestry of St Luke Chelsea was divided into four wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 or Stanley (9), No. 2 or Church (18), No. 3 or Hans Town (21) and No. 4 or Royal Hospital (12).

In 1894 as its population had increased the incorporated vestry was re-divided into five wards (electing vestrymen): Stanley (12), Church &amp; Cheyne (15), Hans Town (12), Royal Hospital (9) and Kensal Town (12).

The metropolitan borough was also divided into five wards for elections: Cheyne, Church, Hans Town, Royal Hospital and Stanley.

===Borough council===
The borough council was controlled by the Municipal Reform Party, which was allied to the Conservative Party, from its creation until 1949. In that year, the &quot;Municipal Reform&quot; label was discarded, and the Conservative party governed the borough until the borough&#x27;s abolition in 1965. Chelsea Town Hall, a neo-classical building containing frescos, remains in use. It is situated on King&#x27;s Road, at the corner of Chelsea Manor Street.

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to parliament, the borough formed a single constituency. By 1950, the decline in population meant that the Chelsea constituency also included the Brompton area of the Metropolitan Borough of Kensington.

<text>The Standard Motor Company Limited was a motor vehicle manufacturer, founded in Coventry, England, in 1903 by Reginald Walter Maudslay. For many years, it manufactured Ferguson TE20 tractors powered by its Vanguard engine. All Standard&#x27;s tractor assets were sold to Massey Ferguson in 1959. Standard purchased Triumph in 1945 and in 1959 officially changed its name to Standard-Triumph International and began to put the Triumph brand name on all its products. A new subsidiary took the name The Standard Motor Company Limited and took over the manufacture of the group&#x27;s products.

The Standard name was last used in Britain in 1963, and in India in 1988.

==History==
===1903–1914===
Maudslay, great-grandson of the eminent engineer Henry Maudslay, had trained under Sir John Wolfe-Barry as a civil engineer. In 1902 he joined his cousin Cyril Charles Maudslay at his Maudslay Motor Company to make marine internal combustion engines. The marine engines did not sell very well, and still in 1902 they made their first engine intended for a car. It was fitted to a chain-drive chassis. The three-cylinder engine, designed by Alexander Craig was an advanced unit with a single overhead camshaft and pressure lubrication.

Realising the enormous potential of the horseless carriage and using a gift of £3,000 from Sir John Wolfe-Barry, R. W. Maudslay left his cousin and became a motor manufacturer on his own account. His Standard Motor Company was incorporated on 2 March 1903 and he established his business in a small factory in a two-storey building in Much Park Street, Coventry. Having undertaken the examination of several proprietary engines to familiarise himself with internal combustion engine design he employed seven people to assemble the first car, powered by a single-cylinder engine with three-speed gearbox and shaft drive to the rear wheels. By the end of 1903 three cars had been built and the labour force had been increased to twenty five. The increased labour force produced a car every three weeks during 1904.

The single-cylinder model was soon replaced by a two-cylinder model quickly followed by three- and four-cylinder versions and in 1905 the first six. Even the first cars boasted shaft drive as opposed to chains, and the engines were not merely &quot;square&quot; but had 6&quot; diameter pistons with a 3&quot; stroke. As well as supplying complete chassis, the company found a good market selling engines for fitting to other cars, especially where the owner wanted more power. Although Alex Craig, a Scottish engineer, was engaged to do much of the detail work, Maudslay himself was sufficiently confident to undertake much of the preliminary layout. One of the several derivations of the name &quot;Standard&quot; is said to have emanated from a discussion between Maudslay and Craig during which the latter proposed several changes to a design on the grounds of cost, which Maudslay rejected, saying that he was determined to maintain the best possible &quot;standard&quot;.
In 1905 Maudslay himself drove the first Standard car to compete in a race. This was the RAC Tourist Trophy in which he finished 11th out of 42 starters, having had a non-stop run. In 1905 the first export order was also received, from a Canadian who arrived at the factory in person. The order was reported in the local newspaper with some emphasis, &quot;Coventry firm makes bold bid for foreign markets&quot;.

The company exhibited at the 1905 London Motor Show in Crystal Palace, at which a London dealer, Charles (later Sir Charles) Friswell (1872–1926) agreed to buy the entire factory output. He joined Standard and later was managing director for many years.

In late 1906 production was transferred to larger premises and output was concentrated on 6-cylinder models. The 16/20 h.p. tourer with side-entrance body was priced at £450. An indication of how much this was can be gained from the fact that a draughtsman earned £3 a week. In 1907 Friswell became company chairman. He worked hard to raise its profile, and the resulting increase in demand necessitated the acquisition of a large single-storey building in Cash&#x27;s Lane, Coventry. Even this was inadequate after the publicity gained when a fleet of 20 cars, 16/20 tourers, were supplied for the use of Commonwealth editors attending the 1909 Imperial Press Conference in London. In 1909 the company first made use of the famous Union Flag Badge, a feature of the radiator emblem until after the Second World War. By 1911 the range of vehicles was comprehensive, with the 8-horsepower model being produced in quantity whilst a special order for two 70 hp cars was at the same time executed for a Scottish millionaire. Friswell&#x27;s influence culminated in supplying seventy 4-cylinder 16 hp cars for King George V and his entourage, including the Viceroy of India, at the 1911 Delhi Durbar. In 1912 Friswell sold his interest in Standard to C. J. Band and Siegfried Bettmann, the founder of the Triumph Motor Cycle Company (which became the Triumph Motor Company). During the same year the first commercial vehicle was produced, and the 4-cylinder model &quot;S&quot; was introduced at £195, the first to be put into large-scale production. 1,600 were produced before the outbreak of the First World War, 50 of them in the final week of car production. These cars were sold with a three-year guarantee. In 1914 Standard became a public company.

===First World War===

During the First World War the company produced more than 1,000 aircraft, including the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.12, Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8, Sopwith Pup and Bristol F.2-B in a new works at Canley that opened on 1 July 1916. Canley would subsequently become the main centre of operations. Other war materials produced included shells, mobile workshops for the Royal Engineers, and trench mortars.


===1919–1939===

Civilian car production was restarted in 1919 with models based on pre-war designs, for example the 9.5 model &quot;S&quot; was re-introduced as the model SLS although this was soon superseded by an 8 h.p. model.

In the early 1920s saloon bodies were first offered; previously all cars had been tourers. The bodies had, since the move to Bishopsgate Green, been made in Coventry by the company itself, but it was not until 1922 that they were mass-produced, using a wooden track along which they were pushed by hand. The company was justifiably proud of the modern factory at Canley, boasting in its advertisements &quot;It is a beautifully lighted and well-aired factory standing on the edge of a breezy common away from the city din and smoke, that the finishing touches and test are given to the All British &#x27;Standard&#x27; Light cars which issue there to almost every quarter in the world&quot;.

It was about this time during the early 1920s that the slogan &quot;Count them on the road&quot; appeared on every advertisement. By 1924 the company had a share of the market comparable to Austin Motor Company, making more than 10,000 cars in 1924. As the immediate post-war boom faded, many rival marques were discontinued. Cars became steadily larger and more elaborate as manufacturers sought to maintain sales. During the 1920s all the models were named after towns, not only near the factory such as Canley and Kenilworth but also further afield – Teignmouth, Falmouth and Exmouth.

By the late 1920s profits had decreased dramatically due to great reinvestment, a failed export contract and bad sales of the larger cars. In 1927 the inadvisability of matching the larger more elaborate trend became apparent and the 9 hp Fulham with fabric body was introduced at £185. Production was concentrated mainly on one basic chassis with a 9 hp engine. The importance of standardisation was now appreciated and only one alternative was offered. In 1929 John Black, a joint managing director of Hillman, took up an appointment at Standard as joint managing director.

====Standard Swallow and Jaguar====
Black encouraged the supply of chassis to external coachbuilders such as Avon and Swallow Coachbuilding and Jensen. The coachbuilding company of Avon during the early 1930s commenced producing cars with a distinctly sporty appearance, using as a foundation, a complete chassis from the Standard Motor Company. These chassis were ordinary production units, used because of their sound engineering design and good performance. Known as Avon Standard Specials they catered for a select market too small for Standard themselves. 
It was not until 1930, after the replacement of artillery wheels by spoke wheels that the distinctive radiator shape first used on the 6-cylinder models in 1906 was finally abandoned. In 1930, before the worst of the Depression, the Big Nine was introduced which together with the 6-cylinder Ensign and Envoy constituted the complete range. Here standardisation was taken a step further with the bodies on 9 hp four-cylinder and 15 hp six-cylinder being almost indistinguishable except for bonnet length. The Big Nine was soon followed by the Big Twelve and sales for the second six months of 1931 exceeded those of the whole of the previous year. In 1932 there was a Royal visit to the Canley works by the Duke of Gloucester who came to open the Canley Pavilion outside which he took delivery of a new 6-cylinder model.

Founder and Chairman Reginald Maudslay retired in 1934 and died soon afterwards on 14 December 1934 at the age of 64. Charles James Band 1883–1961, a Coventry solicitor and a Standard director since 1920, replaced him as chairman and served in that capacity until the beginning of 1954 though Sir John Black briefly held the appointment before he retired. 1935 saw all production transferred to the Canley site. Extensive re-organisation occurred including a continuous track being laid down in the paint shop on which the cars were completely painted.

Through the 1930s, fortunes improved with new models, the Standard Nine and Standard Ten addressed the low to mid range market. At the 1935 Motor Show the new range of Flying Standards was announced with (semi) streamlined bodies. The Flying Standards came to the market in 1936 with their distinctive streamlined sloping rears virtually replacing the existing range of Nine, Twelve, Sixteen, and Twenty. The Flying Standards were so-called because of the major radiator shell change to a &quot;waterfall&quot; grille topped by the Union Jack badge apparently streaming backwards in contrast to its previous forward-facing position. 

In 1938 a new factory was opened at Fletchampstead. That year, Standard launched the Flying Eight. The Flying Eight had a new four-cylinder engine smaller than that in the Flying Nine, and was the first British mass-produced light saloon with independent front suspension. The Flying Ten and Flying Twelve were also given new chassis with independent front suspension in 1938.

The aero engine plant at Banner Lane, a shadow factory, began construction in mid 1939 and production began in 1940. It was managed by Standard for the Air Ministry. After the war Standard leased Banner Lane and, in partnership with Harry Ferguson, used it for the manufacture of Ferguson tractors.

By the beginning of the war, Standard&#x27;s annual production was approximately 50,000 units.




===Second World War===
The company continued to produce its cars during the Second World War, but now mainly fitted with utility bodies (&quot;Tillys&quot;). However, the most famous war-time product was the de Havilland Mosquito aircraft, mainly the FB VI version, of which more than 1100 were made. 750 Airspeed Oxfords were also made as well as 20,000 Bristol Mercury VIII engines, and 3,000 Bristol Beaufighter fuselages.

Other wartime products included 4000 Beaverette light armoured cars and a prototype lightweight &quot;Jeep&quot; type vehicle.

===Post-war years===
With peace, the pre-war Eight and Twelve fitted with 1776cc engine sold as 14 hp cars were quickly back in production using tools carefully stored since 1939. Of greater significance was the 1945 purchase, arranged by Sir John Black for £75,000, of the Triumph Motor Company. Triumph had gone into receivership in 1939, and was now reformed as a wholly owned subsidiary of Standard, named Triumph Motor Company (1945) Limited. The Triumph factory was near the city centre and had been completely destroyed in the blitz. A lucrative deal was also arranged to build the small Ferguson Company tractor. This arrangement was considered primarily by Black as a means to securing increased profits to fund new car development.

====Ferguson tractor====

In December 1945 Standard Motor Company Limited announced that an arrangement had been made to manufacture Harry Ferguson&#x27;s tractors and the Air Ministry&#x27;s shadow factory at Banner Lane Coventry run by Standard during the war would be used for the project. These tractors would be for the Eastern hemisphere, Ferguson tractors built by Ford in America for the Western hemisphere. Production was expected to start in 1946. Implements would be sourced separately by Ferguson who would also merchandise the tractors and the implements.

====Standard Vanguard====
A one-model policy for the Standard marque (alongside a range of new Triumphs) was adopted in 1948 with the introduction of the 2-litre Standard Vanguard, which was styled on American lines by Walter Belgrove, and replaced all the carry-over pre-war models. This aptly named model was the first true post-war design from any major British manufacturer. The beetle-back Vanguard Phase 1 was replaced in 1953 by the notch-back Phase 2 and in 1955 by the all-new Phase 3, which resulted in variants such as the Sportsman, Ensign, Vanguard Vignale and Vanguard Six.

====Standard Eight and Ten====
The one-model policy lasted until 1953, when a new Standard Eight small car was added. This was introduced at £481. 7. 6. the cheapest four-door saloon on the market, yet it boasted independent front suspension, hydraulic brakes and an economical O.H.V. engine. At the same time in another part of the same building Standards were producing a very different engine, the Rolls-Royce Avon jet aero engine of which 415 were made between 1951 and 1955. In 1954 the Eight was supplemented by the slightly more powerful Standard Ten which featured a wider chrome grille.

====Engines====
The Phase II Vanguard was powered, like the Phase I, by a 2088 cc 4-cylinder &quot;wet sleeve&quot; engine, now with a modestly increased compression ratio, and producing 68 hp. This engine could be modified by using an additional intake system and two single-barrel Solex carburettors, producing 90 hp. Typically, the Phase II engine was one Solex carburettor, with 85 mm by 93 mm pistons. Standard Motors at the time supplied many of these engines to Ferguson Tractor distributed in the United States.

====Standard Pennant====
The Ten was followed in its turn in 1957 by the Standard Pennant featuring very prominent tail fins, but otherwise little altered structurally from the 1953 Standard Eight. An option for the Ten, and standard fitment to the Pennant, was the Gold Star engine, tuned for greater power and torque than the standard 948 cc unit. Another tuning set, featuring a different camshaft and twin carburettors, was available from dealers. As well as an overdrive for the gearbox, an option for the Eight, Ten and Pennant was the Standrive, a semi-manual transmission that automatically operated the clutch during gearchanges.

====Triumph TR2====

During the same year that the &#x27;8&#x27; was introduced, another car was displayed at the London Motor Show. This was the Triumph 20TS, a sports two-seater with a modified Standard &#x27;8&#x27; chassis and a Vanguard engine. The 20TS&#x27;s lack of luggage space and unsatisfactory performance and handling resulted in production being delayed until the next year when the chassis and drivetrain were developed and the body was restyled to incorporate a generous boot. The car was badged as a &#x27;Triumph&#x27; rather than a &#x27;Standard&#x27; and the Triumph TR2 was a winner. Ken Richardson achieved on the Jabbeke Highway in Belgium in a slightly modified car. As a result of the publicity, small manufacturers, including Morgan, Peerless, Swallow, and Doretti, bought engines and other components from Standard Motor Company.

====Standard Atlas van====

In 1958 the Standard Atlas panel van and pick-up was first marketed, a cab-over-engine design. It initially used the 948 cc engine from the Standard 10, making the resulting vehicle woefully underpowered, even with its 6.66:1 final drive ratio. In 1961, the Atlas Major was introduced, and sold alongside the original 948 cc Atlas. This variant was powered by the Standard 1670 cc wet-liner engine, as used with different capacities in the Vanguard cars, and the Ferguson tractor. The same engine was also used in Triumph TR2, TR3 and TR4 sports cars. To use this larger engine, a substantial redesign of the cab interior and forward chassis was necessary. The vehicles were of a high standard but not priced competitively, which resulted in relatively few sales. In 1963 the Atlas Major became the Standard 15, with a new long-wheelbase variant, with 2138 cc engine, which became the Standard 20. Later that year, the Standard name was dropped by Leyland, and these models were rebranded hastily as the Leyland 15 and 20. By 1968 when production ended in the UK, all variants were powered by the 2138 cc engine and badged as Leyland 20s. These vehicles were badged as Triumphs for export to Canada, and possibly other overseas markets. The van&#x27;s tooling was also exported to India after UK production ceased, where the resultant vehicle continued in production until the 1980s.

====Triumph Herald====
By the later 1950s the small Standards were losing out in the UK market to more modern competitor designs, and the Triumph name was believed to be more marketable; hence the 1959 replacement for the Eight, Ten and Pennant was badged as the Triumph Herald; with substantial mechanical components carried over from the small Standards. Despite the separate chassis and independent rear suspension, the differential, hubs, brakes, engine and gearbox were all common to the last Standard Pennants. In order to build the Herald the company invested £ million in a new assembly hall extension at the Canley plant which Standard had acquired in 1916. The builders of the three-storey building excavated 250,000 tons of soil and rock. Inside the building were three 1300 ft assembly lines equipped to be one of the most modern car assembly plants in the world. This turned out to be the company&#x27;s last investment on such a scale at Canley: investment decisions after the merger with Rover would favour the newer plant at Solihull.

====Overseas plants====
Overseas manufacturing plants were opened in Australia, France, India and South Africa. Overseas assembly plants were opened in Canada, Ireland and New Zealand.

===Sir John Black===
During the year ended 31 August 1954 Standard made and sold 73,000 cars and 61,500 tractors and much more than half of those were exported. Since the war Standard had made and sold some 418,000 cars and 410,000 tractors and again much more than half were exported. Appointed to Standard&#x27;s then ailing business in 1929, director and general manager since 1930 and appointed managing director in 1934 energetic Sir John Black resigned as chairman and managing director of Standard that year following a serious motorcar accident. He was advised (after consultations with his wife and close friends) to relinquish his offices of chairman and managing director and his membership of the board of directors. His deputy and long-time personal assistant, Alick Dick 1916–1986, took his position as managing director. Air Marshal Lord Tedder was appointed chairman, Tedder would hold that position until the Leyland Motors takeover at the end of 1960. Alick Dick resigned in August 1961 when the board was reorganised by Leyland in view of the substantial losses Standard was accumulating.

The company started considering partners to enable continued expansion and negotiations were begun with Chrysler, Massey-Harris-Ferguson, Rootes Group, Rover and Renault but these were inconclusive.

====Standard&#x27;s Vanguard engine====
The Vanguard&#x27;s engine, later slightly enlarged, powered two saloons, a tractor and three sports cars
====Leyland Motors====
The Standard-Triumph company was eventually bought in 1960 by Leyland Motors which paid £20 million and the last Standard, an Ensign Deluxe, was produced in the UK in May 1963, when the final Vanguard models were replaced by the Triumph 2000 model. Triumph continued when Leyland became British Leyland Motor Corporation (later BL) in 1968. The Standard brand was ended on 17 August 1970 when a sudden announcement said that henceforth the company was to be known as the Triumph Motor Company. The Standard name has been unused in Europe since then and the Triumph or Rover Triumph BL subsidiary used the former Standard engineering and production facilities at Canley in Coventry until the plant was closed in 1980.

====BMW====
BMW acquired the Standard and Triumph brands following its purchase of BL&#x27;s successor Rover Group in 1994. When most of Rover was sold in 2000, BMW kept the Standard brand along with Triumph, Mini and Riley. The management of British Motor Heritage, gained the rights to the Standard Brand upon their management purchase of this company from BMW in 2001.

There was talk of a possible revival of the Standard name by MG Rover for its importation of the Tata Indica. However, for reasons relating to the ownership of the brand by BMW, the car was finally launched as the Rover CityRover.

==Standard in India==
The Standard name had disappeared from Britain during the 1960s but continued for two more decades in India, where Standard Motor Products of India Ltd manufactured the Triumph Herald badged as the &#x27;Standard Herald&#x27; and with the basic 948 cc engine during the 1960s, with increasingly local content and design changes over the years, eventually producing additional four-door and five-door estate models exclusively for the Indian market by the late 1960s.

After 1970, Standard Motor Products split with British Leyland, and introduced a bodily restyled four-door saloon based on the Herald known as the Standard Gazel in 1972, using the same 948 cc engine but with a live rear axle, as the Herald&#x27;s swing-axle was not liked much by Indian buyers and mechanics alike. Allegedly India&#x27;s first indigenous car, the Gazel was built in small numbers – it has been suggested that it did so to keep its manufacturer&#x27;s licence – until 1977. With the company concentrating solely on producing commercial vehicles based on the Leyland 20 model, badged as &quot;Standard 20&quot;, production of Standard cars ceased until the Standard 2000, a rebadged Rover SD1, was introduced in 1985. The car was higher and had a slightly modified old 1991 cc Standard Vanguard engine, as the company could not procure the licence to use the original Rover engine on this car. Being expensive and outdated it was not successful, apart from the reasons that it had competition from cars with Japanese and other newer, fuel-efficient technology in India. It ceased production in 1988, with the factory in Perungalathur near Chennai also closing its operations at the same time, around the same time that the last examples of the SD1 left British showrooms (production had finished in 1986 but stocks lasted for around two more years). After feeble efforts over successive years to revive the company, the premises were auctioned off in 2006 and Britain&#x27;s Rimmer Bros. bought up the entire unused stock of SD1 parts. This also signalled the end of the Standard marque.

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Kensington was a metropolitan borough in the County of London from 1900 to 1965, which since 1901 was known as the Royal Borough of Kensington, following the death of Queen Victoria, in accordance with her wishes.

==History==
It bordered Chelsea, Fulham, Hammersmith, Paddington, and Westminster.

It included Kensington, South Kensington, Earls Court, Notting Hill, Brompton and part of Kensal Green.

In 1901 it was granted the status of a royal borough, and therefore from then was also known as the Royal Borough of Kensington. The status was granted after the death of Queen Victoria, in accordance with her wish (she was born at Kensington Palace in the borough).

In 1965 it was amalgamated with the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea to form the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

A number of street signs in the area still bear the designation &quot;Royal Borough of Kensington&quot;.

The old Town Hall was demolished &quot;in controversial circumstances&quot; involving an impending conservation order in June 1982.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms is derived from those of the former Lords of the Manor, and that of the parish church, which is dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

==Population and area==
The Kensington borough covered once part of Kensal New Town (a detached part of Chelsea before 1901) became incorporated. The population of Kensington recorded in the Census, which excludes Kensal New Town before 1901, was:

Kensington Vestry 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900–1961
==Politics==

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; however the parish of St Mary Abbots Kensington had already been divided into three wards by the Kensington Improvement Act 1851 (14 &amp; 15 Vict. c. cxvi). So the incorporated vestry inherited these wards and assigned vestrymen to them: The Holy Trinity Brompton (27), St John&#x27;s Notting Hill &amp; St James&#x27; Norland (27) and St Mary Abbots (30).

In 1894 as its population had increased the incorporated vestry was re-divided into eight wards (electing vestrymen): Golborne (18), Norland (15), Pembridge (15), Holland (15), Earl&#x27;s Court (12), Queen&#x27;s Gate (15), Redcliffe (15) and Brompton (15).

The metropolitan borough was divided into nine wards for elections: Brompton, Earl&#x27;s Court, Golborne, Holland, Norland, Pembridge, Queen&#x27;s Gate, Redcliffe and St Charles.

===Borough council===

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was divided into two constituencies:
*Kensington North
*Kensington South
In 1950 the borough&#x27;s representation was increased to two and a half seats, when part of it was merged with Chelsea:
*Chelsea
*Kensington North
*Kensington South
In 2010, the constituencies of Kensington North and South were merged to create a single constituency once again and Chelsea was branched off to create a new constituency.
*Kensington
*Chelsea and Fulham

<doc id="381701" wikidata="Q2108247" url="?curid=381701" title="Spotted salamander">
<text>The spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), also known commonly as the yellow-spotted salamander, is a species of mole salamander in the family Ambystomatidae. The species is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is the state amphibian of Ohio and South Carolina. The species ranges from Nova Scotia, to Lake Superior, to southern Georgia and Texas. Its embryos have been found to have symbiotic algae living in and around them, the only known example of vertebrate cells hosting an endosymbiont microbe (unless mitochondria are considered).

==Description==
The spotted salamander is about long (tail included), with females generally being larger than males. It is stout, like most mole salamanders, and has a wide snout. The spotted salamander&#x27;s main color is black, but can sometimes be a bluish-black, dark gray, dark green, or even dark brown. Two uneven rows of yellowish-orange spots run from the top of the head (near the eyes) to the tip of the tail (dorso-lateral ranging). The spotted salamander&#x27;s spots near the top of its head are more orange, while the spots on the rest of its body are more yellow. The underside of the spotted salamander is slate gray and pink. Sexual dimorphism (physical differences between males and females) is displayed in the form of larger-bodied females having brighter-coloured spots. Males will have a larger portion of the dorsal surface covered in spots that are less bright. There is also a correlation between body condition and spots having lower chroma.

The scientific name &quot;Ambystoma maculatum&quot; comes from &quot;Ambystoma – amblys&quot; (Greek) for blunt; -&quot;stoma&quot; (Greek) meaning mouth; or &quot;anabystoma&quot; (New Latin) meaning &quot;to cram into the mouth&quot;; &quot;maculatum – macula&quot; (Latin) for spot; &quot;maculosus&quot; (Latin) for spotted.

&quot;A. maculatum&quot; develops a larger tail fin and body to compete with other predators. It typically lives around 20 years, but some have lived up to 30 years.

==Habitat and dispersal==
The spotted salamander usually lives in mature forests with ponds or ephemeral vernal pools for breeding sites. Vernal pools are suitable breeding sites for these amphibians as they dry often enough to exclude fish that eat the salamander eggs and larvae, while retaining water long enough to allow amphibian larvae to complete development and metamorphose into terrestrial adults. A study showed larger pools (as opposed to smaller pools) had more egg masses, higher occupancy, and higher larval survival rates for spotted salamanders. Outside of the breeding season, these salamanders spend their time in forests with well-drained soils that contain many burrows dug by small mammals. They have also been known to be absent from landscapes and forest with canopy cover below 30%.

Salamander populations from nearby pools form genetically-distinct metapopulations. Subpopulations within 4.8 kilometers share a higher proportion of genes, while populations greater than 4.8 kilometers share a smaller proportion of genes. Inter-population dispersal is likely mediated by both species-specific behaviors and natural limitations.

==Behavior==
The spotted salamander is fossorial. It rarely comes above ground, except after a rain or for foraging and breeding. During the winter, it brumates underground, and is not seen again until breeding season in early March–May.

In North Amherst, Massachusetts, United States, spotted salamanders cross the street to get from their overwintering sites in the wooded area east of the roadway to their breeding sites to the west. Local officials built amphibian and reptile tunnels called the Henry Street salamander tunnels to help the salamanders cross the road to get to vernal pools. In the spring after rain and when temperatures rise above , salamanders emerge from underground. They cross Henry Street to get to their breeding grounds, vernal pools which form on the other side of the road, an event common among amphibians and known as the Big Night.

&quot;A. maculatum&quot; has several methods of defense, including hiding in burrows or leaf litter, autotomy of the tail, and a toxic milky liquid it excretes when perturbed. This secretion comes from large poison glands around the back and neck. The spotted salamander, like other salamanders, shows great regenerative abilities: if a predator manages to dismember a part of a leg, tail, or even parts of the brain, head, or organs, the salamander can grow back a new one, although this takes a massive amount of energy. As juveniles, they spend most of their time under the leaf litter near the bottom of the pools where their eggs were laid. The larvae tend to occupy refuges in vegetation, and lower their activity in the presence of predators.

&quot;A. maculatum&quot; tend to follow the same path in their migration to and from their burrows and breeding pools. They accomplish their journey in conditions that lack visual cues, since it is usually during periods of cloud cover. Some studies show evidence of landmark learning in spotted salamanders. Researchers found that spotted salamanders can associate visual landmarks with food. Thus spotted salamanders may learn landmarks in their habitat that are reliable indicators of resource locations or provide orientation clues for migration to and from breeding ponds.

Male salamanders come out earlier than females due to different responses in temperature than females. According to a study there is a correlation between the salamander&#x27;s spot coloration and body condition. Salamanders&#x27; in lower body condition had less color and those with a better body score had brighter colored spots.

===Diet===
The spotted salamander preys upon earthworms, slugs, snails, spiders, millipedes, centipedes, insects, algae and other invertebrates. The spotted salamander larvae are aggresive predatoers, and have been known to cannibalize others when food is scarce. &quot;A. maculatum&quot; sometimes also eats smaller salamanders, such as the red-backed salamander. The adult spotted salamander uses its sticky tongue to catch food.

==Lifecycle==
During the majority of the year, spotted salamanders live in the shelter of leaves or burrows in deciduous forests. However, when the temperature rises and the moisture level is high, the salamanders make their abrupt migration towards their annual breeding ponds. Recent studies, however, indicate that temperature may be a more important factor than precipitation, as precipitation in winter months increase, yet salamanders do not migrate. In just one night, hundreds to thousands of salamanders may make the trip to their ponds for mating. Males will start a dance-like behavior called a liebsspiel, where afterward they lay down their spermatophore. This dance includes the salamanders circling around one another and putting their head&#x27;s on one another&#x27;s tail. Then, the male will swim away wiggling his tail. If the female wants to mate she will follow him to a sperm pack he made earlier. (&quot;Spotted Salamander Ambystoma Maculatum&quot;) Males will migrate at higher rates than females early in the migration season. This could be due to different responses to temperature between males and females. Mates usually breed in ponds when it is raining in the spring. Females usually lay about 100 eggs in one clutch that cling to the underwater plants and form egg masses.

The egg masses are round, jelly-like clumps that are usually long. The spotted salamander produces a unique polymorphism in the outer jelly layers of its egg masses: one morph has a clear appearance and contains a water-soluble protein, whereas the other morph is white and contains a crystalline hydrophobic protein. This polymorphism is thought to confer advantages in vernal pools with varying dissolved nutrient levels, while also reducing mortality from feeding by wood frog larvae.

Adults only stay in the water for a few days, then the eggs hatch in one to two months. When the eggs hatch depends on the water temperatures. Eggs of &quot;A. maculatum&quot; can have a symbiotic relationship with the green alga &quot;Chlorococcum amblystomatis&quot;. A dense gelatinous matrix surrounds the eggs and prevents the eggs from drying out, but it inhibits oxygen diffusion (required for embryo development). &quot;C. amblystomatis&quot; provides increased oxygen and supplemental nutrition from fixed carbon products via photosynthesis and removes the embryo&#x27;s nitrogenous waste (ammonia) in the egg capsule, aiding in the salamander&#x27;s embryonic development and growth. The developing salamander thus metabolizes the oxygen, producing carbon dioxide (which then the alga consumes). Photosynthetic algae are present within the egg capsule of the developing salamander embryo, enhancing growth. However, the widely used herbicide, atrazine, has been found to significantly lower hatching success rate by eliminating the symbiotic algae associated with the egg masses.

As larvae, they are usually light brown or greenish-yellow. They have small dark spots and are born with external gills. In two to four months, the larvae lose their gills, and become juvenile salamanders that leave the water. Spotted salamanders have been known to live up to 32 years, and normally return to the same vernal pool every year. These pools are seasonal and will usually dry up during the late spring and stay dry until winter.

Spotted salamanders are often preyed on by raccoons, skunks, turtles, and snakes. For this reason they perform an important function by connecting the food chain. Moreover, one of their predators is humans since they are popularly sought out through the pet trade.

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Fulham was a metropolitan borough in the County of London between 1900 and 1965, when it was merged with the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith to form the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. It was a riverside borough, and comprised the many centuries-long definition of Fulham so included parts often considered of independent character today Walham Green, Parsons Green, Hurlingham, Sands End and that part of Chelsea Harbour west of Counter&#x27;s Creek. The SW6 postal district approximately follows this as does the direct, though less empowered, predecessor Fulham civil parish.

==Coat of arms==

When the metropolitan borough was formed it carried on using the unofficial arms adopted by its predecessor, Fulham vestry in 1886. This was a quartered shield, with a depiction of a bridge in the first and fourth quarters. The bridge in the first quarter was the original wooden Putney Bridge, opened in 1729 with its toll houses. Its replacement, the present Putney Bridge, constructed of stone, was shown in the fourth quarter. The new bridge was opened in 1886, when the arms were designed. The second quarter showed crossed swords, from the arms of the Bishop of London. The manor of Fulham was held by the bishop from 691, and his official residence, Fulham Palace, was built in the area. The third quarter was the arms then associated with the county of Middlesex, in which Fulham lay until 1889. The three seaxes on a red field was also regarded as the arms of Essex.

In 1927, councillor F. H. Barber, proprietor of Barber&#x27;s Department Store in the borough, offered to pay the costs of a grant of arms and new civic regalia. Accordingly, an official grant was obtained from the College of Arms on 12 October of that year, blazoned as follows:
:&quot;Barry wavy of ten, Argent and azure, on a Saltire gules, two swords in Saltire points upwards of the first enfiled of a Mitre Or, and for the Crest upon a Mural Crown of Seven turrets Or and Ancient Rowing Ship in full sail Sable, the Flags per fesse Argent and Azure charged on the sail with a Rose Gules, surmounted by a Rose Argent barbed Vert and seeded proper.&quot;
The silver and blue wavy field was for the River Thames, the swords and mitre signifying the Bishop of London.

The crest rose from a gold mural crown, resembling a city wall, and thus municipal government. The crest itself was a black ship, recalling an expedition to Fulham by the Danes in 879. The main sail was charged with a Tudor rose, recalling the importance of the area in that era, when Fulham Palace was rebuilt.

The Latin motto, &quot;Pro Civibus Et Civitate&quot;, was translated as &quot;for citizens and state&quot;.

The waves from the shield, the two swords, the mitre and most of the crest was brought to the coat of arms of the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham when Fulham and Hammersmith merged to form a new London borough in 1965.

==Population and area==
Over its existence the borough&#x27;s area varied from 1,704 to . The population, as recorded at the census, was:

Fulham Vestry 1801-1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900–1961
==Town hall==
The borough was administered from Fulham Town Hall, on Fulham Broadway, in Walham Green. The hall had been built in 1888 – 1890 for the Fulham vestry, and was in the &quot;classical renaissance&quot; style. When the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham was formed, Hammersmith Town Hall was adopted as the administrative centre. Some offices remain at Fulham however, and contains a registry office. The grand hall is a popular venue for concerts and dances. The london borough council also makes the building available for filming purposes.

==Politics==

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; however the parish of Fulham did not exceed this number so was not divided into wards.

In 1883-84 the population had increased enough for the parish to be divided into three wards (electing vestrymen): North End (27), Walham (27) and South Fulham (18).

In 1894 as its population had increased the newly incorporated vestry was re-divided into eight wards (electing vestrymen): Baron&#x27;s Court (12), Margravine (9), Munster (9), Lillie (12), Walham (12), Town (6), Hurlingham (3) and Sands End (9).

The metropolitan borough was divided into eight wards for elections: Baron&#x27;s Court, Hurlingham, Lillie, Margravine, Munster, Sands End, Town, and Walham.

===Borough council===

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough for 18 years amounted to one seat:
*Fulham
In 1918 such representation was increased to two seats:
*Fulham East
*Fulham West
In 1955 such representation was reduced to seats. The half seat shared was with part of the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith and was named:
*Barons Court
The other seat was:
*Fulham (reduced period of the seat mentioned in the bullet point above)

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith was a metropolitan borough in London, England from 1900 to 1965. It included Hammersmith, Wormwood Scrubs, Old Oak Common and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. 

The borough was created in 1900 from the parish of Hammersmith, with the Hammersmith Metropolitan Borough Council replacing the Hammersmith Vestry.

In 1965, the borough was abolished and became the northern part of the London Borough of Hammersmith, later renamed to the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in 1979.

==History==
The London Government Act 1899 (62 &amp; 63 Vict. c. 14) reformed the administration of London by dividing the County of London into 28 metropolitan boroughs, replacing the 41 parish vestries and district boards of works administering the area. Under the terms of the London Government Act 1899, each borough was to be governed by a borough council consisting of a mayor, aldermen and councillors.

On 13 March 1900, Drafts of Orders in Council were laid before both Houses of Parliament for the establishment and incorporation of the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith.

On 15 May 1900, by the &quot;Borough of Hammersmith in Council, 1900&quot; Order in Council, the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith was formed from the civil parish of Hammersmith, and the Hammersmith Metropolitan Borough Council (formally &quot;The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith&quot;) was established and incorporated as a body corporate, replacing the Hammersmith Vestry.

The London Government Act 1963 created Greater London, divided into 32 London boroughs, abolishing civil parishes in London. On 30 March 1965, The London Government Order 1965 was laid before the house, to effect the changes.

On 1 April 1965, the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith ceased to exist and merged with the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham to form the London Borough of Hammersmith. The Hammersmith Metropolitan Borough Council was succeeded by the Hammersmith London Borough Council.

On 22 November 1978, a specially convened meeting of the council was held to change the borough&#x27;s name. Taking effect on 1 April 1979, the borough was renamed to the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and the council was renamed to the Hammersmith and Fulham Borough Council.

==Coat of Arms==

The coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith was granted to the predecessor Hammersmith Vestry on 23 December 1897. The division of the field was &quot;Party per pale azure and gules, on a chevron between two cross crosslets in chief and an escallop in base argent, three horse-shoes of the first&quot;. The crest was &quot;On a wreath of the colours, upon the battlements of a tower two hammers in saltire all proper&quot;. The motto was &quot;Spectemur agendo&quot;, meaning &quot;&quot;Let us be judged by our actions&quot;.&quot;

The cross crosslets come from the arms of Edward Latymer, who founded schools in Hammersmith in the seventeenth century which later evolved into Latymer Upper School and the Godolphin and Latymer School (both feature cross crosslets in their coats of arms). The horseshoes come from the arms of brickmaker Sir Nicholas Crispe, who introduced his technique into Hammersmith and who helped build a chapel, which was to become St Paul&#x27;s, Hammersmith; and the scallop comes from the arms of George Pring, a surgeon who projected Hammersmith Bridge. The crest was a castle tower surmounted by two hammers, a pun on the name Hammersmith.

The new Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council retained the Metropolitan Borough&#x27;s motto of Spectemur agendo, although it was spelled out in English (&quot;Let us be judged by our acts&quot;) in the new coat of arms for the first few years.

==Population and area==

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 (18 &amp; 19 Vict. c. 120) any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; however the parishes of Fulham District Board of Works did not exceed this number so were not divided into wards.

In 1873 the population had increased enough for the parish of Hammersmith to be divided into three wards (electing vestrymen): North (24), Centre (27) and South (21).

In 1894 as its population had increased the newly incorporated vestry was re-divided into six wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 (12), No. 2 (18), No. 3 (15), No. 4 (15), No. 5 (6) and No. 6 (6).

<doc id="381707" wikidata="Q1925802" url="?curid=381707" title="Metropolitan Borough of Battersea">
<text>Battersea was a civil parish and metropolitan borough in the County of London, England. In 1965, the borough was abolished and its area combined with parts of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth to form the London Borough of Wandsworth. The borough was administered from Battersea Town Hall on Lavender Hill. That building is now Battersea Arts Centre.

==Ancient parish==
As an ancient parish, Battersea was part of the hundred of Brixton and county of Surrey. It included the exclave of Penge.

==Parish in the Metropolis==
In 1855, under the Metropolis Management Act 1855, the civil responsibilities of the parish were passed to the Metropolitan Board of Works. The two parts of the parish were assigned to different districts by the act establishing the MBW: Battersea was included in the area of the Wandsworth District Board of Works and the hamlet of Penge in that of Lewisham District Board of Works. Penge became a civil parish in its own right in 1866.

On 25 March 1888, a separate vestry was formed as a local authority for &quot;The parish of Saint Mary Battersea excluding Penge&quot;. In 1889, the Local Government Act 1888 reconstituted the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works as the County of London, and Battersea was transferred from Surrey to the new county.

The population of the parish in 1896 was 165,115 and it had adopted the Public Libraries Act 1850 immediately upon obtaining local independence in 1888, with its own vestry. For electoral purposes, the parish was divided into four wards and had 120 elected vestrymen.

==Metropolitan borough==
In 1900, the London Government Act 1899 divided the County of London into twenty-eight metropolitan boroughs. The vestries and district boards were dissolved. The parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea, with the borough council replacing the civil vestry.

The Metropolitan Borough included within its bounds Battersea, Battersea Park, Clapham Junction and parts of Wandsworth Common and Clapham Common.

In 1913, John Archer became mayor of the borough and the first black mayor in the capital.

== Ecclesiastical parish ==
The ancient parish, dedicated to St Mary, was in the Diocese of Winchester until 1877, then the Diocese of Rochester until 1905, and then finally in the Diocese of Southwark. From 1851, as the population of Battersea increased, a number of new parishes were formed:
* St George, Nine Elms in 1853
* Christ Church, Battersea Park in 1861 
* St John, York Road Battersea in 1863
* St Philip, Queen&#x27;s Road, Battersea in 1870
* Church of the Ascension, Lavender Hill in 1871
* St Saviour, Battersea Park Road in 1872
* St Peter, Plough Road, Battersea in 1876
* St Mark, Battersea Rise in 1883
* All Saints, Queen&#x27;s Road, Battersea Park in 1884 
* St Michael, Wandsworth Common in 1884 
* St Andrew, Stockdale Road, Battersea in 1886 
* St Stephen, Battersea Bridge Road in 1887 
* St Barnabas, Clapham Common in 1895
* St Luke, Ramsden Road, Battersea in 1901
* St Bartholomew, Wickersley Road, Battersea in 1906

A number of new parishes were also formed within the detached part of Battersea parish, the hamlet of Penge:
* St John the Evangelist, Penge in 1851
* St Paul, Penge in 1869
* Holy Trinity, Anerley Road, Penge in 1873
* Christ Church, Penge in 1886

==Coat of arms==
In 1901, the borough adopted an unofficial coat of arms, consisting of a shield vertically divided blue and white, the division line being indented (in heraldry-speak &quot;Party per pale indented azure and argent&quot;). This design was taken from a flag dating from 1803. On top of the shield was a dove bearing an olive branch. The Latin motto was &quot;Non Mihi, Non Tibi, Sed Nobis&quot;, or &quot;Neither for myself, nor for yourself, but for us&quot;.

In 1955, the borough received an official grant from the College of Arms, based on the old device. The colours in the shield were reversed, and a &quot;bordure&quot; or heraldic border added. The bordure consisted of silver and blue waves, representative of the River Thames, and bore sixteen gold stars for the sixteen wards of the borough. The new crest on top of the helm was the dove of the 1901 design, with the addition of sprigs of lavender, for the old lavender fields of the area, and Lavender Hill, the main road of Battersea. The old motto was retained.

==Population and area==
The area of the borough was . The population recorded in the Census was:

Battersea Vestry 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900–1961
==Politics==

The first election to the council was on 1 November 1900, with the Progressive Party taking control of the new borough. They retained power until 1909, when the Municipal Reform Party (allied to the Conservatives) gained a majority. The Progressives regained the council in 1912, holding power until 1919 when the Labour Party gained control. In 1931 the borough come under Municipal Reform control again. Labour regained power in 1934, retaining it for the rest of the borough&#x27;s existence.

Elections of the whole council were held every three years. Elections were cancelled during the two world wars (1914–1918 and 1939–1945). The 1952 election was postponed for a year so that it did not clash with elections to the London County Council. The number of councillors returned at each election was as follows:.

;Local elections

No Municipal Reform candidates were nominated after 1946, and Conservative candidates were nominated at local elections for the first time.
===Wards===
From 1900 to 1949 the borough was divided into nine wards, returning either three, six or nine councillors:
*Bolingbroke (6 councillors)
*Broomwood (6)
*Church (6)
*Latchmere (6)
*Nine Elms (9)
*Park (6)
*St John (3)
*Shaftesbury (6)
*Winstanley (6)

In 1949 the wards were redrawn, with fourteen wards returning three to five councillors each:
*Bolingbroke (3)
*Broomwood (3)
*Church (4)
*Latchmere (4)
*Lavender (3)
*Newtown (3)
*Nightingale (5)
*Nine Elms (3)
*Park (4)
*Queenstown (4)
*St John (4)
*Shaftesbury (3)
*Stormont (3)
*Thornton (3)
*Vicarage (3)
*Winstanley (3)

The latest ward to be redrawn was Fairfield ward, with three councillors.

===Parliamentary constituencies===
For elections to parliament the borough was originally part of the parliamentary borough of Battersea and Clapham, which consisted of two divisions, Battersea
and Clapham.

In 1918 the metropolitan borough was divided into two constituencies:
*Battersea North (Church, Latchmere, Nine Elms and Park wards) and
*Battersea South (Bolingbroke, Broomwood, St John, Shaftesbury and Winstanley wards)

The boundaries of the two constituencies were adjusted in 1949 to reflect the redrawn borough wards:
*Battersea North (Church, Latchmere, Newtown, Nine Elms, Park, Queenstown, Vicarage and Winstanley wards)
*Battersea South (Bolingbroke, Broomwood, Lavender, Nightingale, St John, Shaftesbury, Stormont and Thornton wards)

The constituencies continued unchanged until 1983 when the Battersea constituency largely succeeded these two.

<text>The Crawford Automobile Company was an American automobile manufacturing company based in Hagerstown, Maryland which produced cars from 1905 to 1923. After the Crawford Automobile Company was purchased by the M. P. Moller Pipe Organ Co., they produced a sporting version of the Crawford called the Dagmar (in production until 1927).

Crawfords were chain-driven until 1907, and the 1911–1914 models featured transaxles. Later cars featured brass trim, disc-covered wooden artillery wheels, and Continental six-cylinder engines.

<doc id="381709" wikidata="Q1796224" url="?curid=381709" title="Metropolitan Borough of Hackney">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Hackney was a metropolitan borough of the County of London from 1900 to 1965. Its area became part of the London Borough of Hackney.

==Formation and boundaries==
The borough was one of twenty-eight metropolitan boroughs created by the London Government Act 1899. It was the successor to the vestry of the parish of Hackney, which had been the local authority since 1894. Between 1855 and 1894 the parish had been administered with Stoke Newington as the Hackney District.

The boundaries of Hackney with the neighbouring boroughs were adjusted slightly in 1900: Hackney gained the east side of Bethune Road from Stoke Newington and the south side of Balls Pond Road from Islington; it lost the west side of Southgate Road to Islington. The boundary with Shoreditch was altered to run along the Regents Canal, Albion Road and Brougham Road, while the boundary with Bethnal Green, which had formed a straight line, was changed to follow the line of Gore Road. A further adjustment was made in 1908, when areas were exchanged with Tottenham Urban District, Middlesex. It had a border with Leyton Urban District (a municipal borough from 1926) in Essex to the east and to the north, from which it was divided by Hackney Marshes.

The metropolitan borough included the districts of Hackney, Upper and Lower Clapton, Homerton, Dalston and Kingsland. It also included Stoke Newington Common, and the entire eastern side of Stoke Newington High Street.

==Population and area==
The metropolitan borough was almost coterminous with the ancient parish of Hackney. Statistics were compiled by the London County Council in 1901 to show population growth in London over the preceding century.

The area of the borough in 1901 was . The populations recorded in National Censuses were:

Hackney Vestry 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900–1961
By comparison, after amalgamation with Shoreditch and Stoke Newington, to form the modern London Borough of Hackney, the combined area became 19.06 km² - approximately ; in 2005, this had a population of 207,700, or a population density of 10,900/km². In 1901 Hackney the population density was 16,475/km².

==Politics==
===Incorporated vestry===

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; as such the parish of St John at Hackney within the Hackney District Board of Works was divided into seven wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 or Stamford Hill (15), No. 2 or West (18), No. 3 or De Beauvoir Town (18), No. 4 or Dalston (18), No. 5 or Hackney (18), No. 6 or Homerton (15) and No. 7 or South (18).

The Hackney Vestry was controlled by the Progressive Party, the grouping linked with the parliamentary Liberal Party. Opposition on the body was provided by the Conservative-backed Moderate Party. The vestry had 119 members, with one third elected annually.

In 1894 as its population had increased the incorporated vestry was re-divided into eight wards (electing vestrymen): Stamford Hill (15), West (18), Kingsland (12), Hackney (12), Mare Street (15), South (15), Clapton (12) and Homerton (21).

===Borough council===
The London Government Act 1899 replaced the incorporated vestries with borough councils consisting of a mayor, aldermen and councillors. All councillors were to be elected every three years. There was one alderman for every six councillors, and these were elected by the council itself.

Boundary commissioners were appointed under the London Government Act 1899 to divide the new boroughs into wards, and to apportion councillors to each ward. It was decided to continue to use the eight vestry wards. The Moderates claimed that Stamford Hill and West Hackney wards were under-represented and should be given nine councillors, with the remaining six wards having six each. In the event, the commissioners apportioned 60 councillors between the eight wards: Clapton Park, Hackney, Homerton and Stamford Hill having nine councillors and Downs, Kingsland, South and West wards having six a piece. With 10 aldermen, the borough council thus had 70 members.

====1900–1919====
The boundary changes seem to have favoured the Moderates, as at the first elections to the council on 1 November 1900 they won a majority with 37 seats to 18 won by the Liberal Party and Progressives, with 3 independent Conservative and 2 independent councillors also returned. At the next election in 1903 the Progressives won control with 49 seats to 11 Conservatives. Three years later the Conservatives ran under the Municipal Reform label. Municipal Reformers won 18 seats and independents supported by them won 20, giving them a majority over the Progressives with 22 seats. The Progressives regained the council in 1909 with a narrow majority, losing power to the Municipal Reform party again in 1912.

====1919–1937====
The next elections, postponed until 1919 due to the First World War, were won by the Labour Party: Labour won 32 seats, Municipal Reform 15 and Progressives 13. At the next elections in 1922 a &quot;Progressive Reform&quot; anti-Labour alliance won all seats on the council, and held them at the subsequent polls in 1925. The 1928 election was partly run on party lines: the Municipal Reform party won control with 31 seats, other Anti-Labour candidates won 15, Labour won 12 and Progressives 1. In 1931 Municipal Reformers won all but one seat, which was held by Labour. Labour gained control of the borough council in 1934, and held power for the rest of the borough&#x27;s existence. In 1934 they won 45 seats to 15 won by Municipal Reformers.

====1937–1965====
In 1937 the borough&#x27;s ward boundaries were redrawn: sixteen wards were created (Chatham, Culford, Dalston, Downs, Graham, Leaside, Marsh, Maury, Park, Ridley, Southwold, Springfield, Stamford, Town Hall, Tudor and Wick), each represented by three councillors. To the forty-eight councillors thus elected were added 8 aldermen. Labour won 41 seats in 1937 to Municipal Reform&#x27;s 7. Local elections were postponed due to the Second World War, and from 1945 the only non-Labour councillors were Communists: 1 was elected in 1945, and 2 in 1949. At the last four elections to the council in 1953, 1956, 1959 and 1962 Labour won all the seats.

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was divided into three constituencies:
*Hackney Central
*Hackney North
*Hackney South
In 1950 the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to one and a half seats, when part of it was merged with Stoke Newington:
*Hackney North and Stoke Newington
*Hackney South
In 1955 the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to one and two half seats, when another part of it was merged with Bethnal Green:
*Hackney Central
*Hackney North and Stoke Newington
*Bethnal Green

==Coat of arms==
The seal of the Hackney Vestry bore a representation of St Augustine&#x27;s Tower, the remains of the 13th-century parish church. When the metropolitan borough was formed in 1900, the vestry seal was altered by the addition of the Latin motto &quot;Justitia Turris Nostra&quot; or &quot;Justice is our tower&quot;.

In January 1924 the borough council resolved to seek a formal grant of armorial bearings from the College of Arms. These were duly made by letters patent dated 31 May 1924. The arms were blazoned as follows:
Per fesse, the chief per pale gules and per fesse Sable and Argent, and the base barry wavy of six Argent and Azure, in the dexter chief a representation of the Hackney Tower proper and in the sinister chief a Maltese Cross per fesse Argent and Gules.
Crest: On a Wreath of the Colours a representation of the Hackney Tower Or. 

The &quot;Hackney Tower&quot; appeared in the upper portion of the shield, and formed the crest, placed on a helm and mantling. The 1900 motto was also retained. The Maltese Cross represented the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller. These orders successively held the manor of Hackney, until the Reformation. The Templars wore red crosses on white mantles, and the Hospitallers white crosses on black: these were combined in the design. The wavy white and blue bars at the base of the shield represented the River Lea and the many canals crossing the borough.

These arms gave much inspiration to the coat of arms of the London Borough of Hackney when the London borough was created in 1965.

==Town hall==
 The borough council was initially based in a &quot;French-Italian&quot; style town hall in Hackney Grove, dating from 1866. The building was extended in 1898. A new Art Deco town hall in Mare Street was begun in 1934, and opened in 1937. It is now the headquarters of the London Borough of Hackney.

<text>Bethnal Green was a civil parish and a metropolitan borough of the County of London between 1899 and 1965, when it was merged with the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney and the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar to form the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

It was formed as a civil parish in 1743 from the Bethnal Green hamlet in Stepney ancient parish, and the church of St Matthew, Bethnal Green, was dedicated in 1746.

The vestry became an electing authority to the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855 and in 1889 it became part of the County of London. In the 1900 reform of local government caused by the London Government Act 1899 the parish became a metropolitan borough which bordered Hackney, Poplar, Stepney and Shoreditch. In 1965 it was abolished and merged into the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

==Origins==
Until 1743 Bethnal Green formed a hamlet within the large parish of Stepney. By the 17th century the settlement had achieved a measure of self-government, with its own overseer, constable and beadle. It remained a rural area until the beginning of the 18th century, when the expansion of suburban London saw the development of the Brick Lane area in the south west of the hamlet. The population rapidly increased and in 1743 an act of parliament, the Bethnal Green Parish Act 1742 (16 Geo. 2. c. 28), constituted Bethnal Green as a separate parish.

As well as forming a parish for ecclesiastical purposes, Bethnal Green was also created a civil parish with responsibility for relief of the poor and maintenance of highways. The government of the parish was shared by a vestry, governors of the poor and two separate bodies of trustees. A further board of paving and lighting commissioners were established in 1843.

In 1855 the parish was included within the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works to which it nominated one member and the various local government bodies were replaced by a single incorporated vestry which consisted of 48 elected vestrymen.

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; as such the incorporated vestry of St Matthew Bethnal Green was divided into four wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 or East (9), No. 2 or North (9), No. 3 or West (15) and No. 4 or South (15).

In 1889 the Metropolitan Board was replaced by the London County Council, and Bethnal Green was formally removed from Middlesex to the new County of London.

== Ecclesiastical parish ==
Bethnal Green was part of the ancient parish of St Dunstan&#x27;s, Stepney, in the Diocese of London; in 1743 the area was split off to form a new parish dedicated to St Matthew.
From 1837, as the population of Bethnal Green increased, a number of new parishes were formed:
* St John, Bethnal Green, in 1837
* St Peter, Bethnal Green, in 1843
* St Andrew, Bethnal Green, in 1843
* St Philip, Bethnal Green, in 1843 
* St James the Less, Bethnal Green, in 1843
* St Bartholomew, Bethnal Green, in 1844 
* St James the Great, Bethnal Green, in 1844 
* St Jude, Bethnal Green, in 1844 
* St Matthias, Bethnal Green, in 1844 
* St Simon Zelotes, Bethnal Green, in 1844
* St Thomas, Bethnal Green, in 1844 
* St Paul, Bethnal Green, in 1865 
* St Barnabas, Bethnal Green, in 1870

In addition, as the population increased, western parts of Bethnal Green were transferred into neighbouring Shoreditch as the new parish of Holy Trinity, Shoreditch, in 1866.

==Creation of the borough==
Under the London Government Act 1899 the various vestries and district boards within the County of London were abolished and replaced by metropolitan borough councils. Accordingly, in 1900, a borough council consisting of a mayor, five aldermen and 30 councillors replaced the vestry. The boundaries of the borough and parish were realigned at the same time.

Bethnal Green Town Hall in Patriot Square was opened in 1910, and extended in 1936–9. The architects were Percy Robinson and William Alban Jones. In 2010 the building was reopened as a hotel; much of the original art deco interior has been retained.

==Borough seal==
The borough seal depicted a scene based on &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Daughter of Bednall Green&quot;, a poem in Percy’s &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot;, published in 1765, but probably dating from the era of Elizabeth I. According to the legend related in the poem, a blind beggar living in Bethnal Green was in fact Henry de Montfort, eldest son of Simon de Montfort, having escaped from the field of the Battle of Evesham in 1265. His identity was revealed at the wedding feast of his daughter Bessie. A depiction of the beggar had appeared on the head of the beadle&#x27;s staff dating from 1690.

==Politics==

In the first election to the borough council, held on 1 November 1900 the Progressives gained a majority, with 22 of the 30 councillors. The Moderates (supported by the Conservative Party) formed the 8 member opposition group. The Progressives increased their majority to 24 at the 1903 elections, and in 1906 they won all the seats on the council. The Progressives held the council against the Municipal Reform Party until 1919 when the Labour Party gained a majority. Progressives and Liberals regained control at the 1928 election, holding power until 1934.

In 1934, Labour again took control, and from that date held all the seats on the council until the borough&#x27;s abolition.

For parliamentary elections, Bethnal Green was divided into two constituencies in 1885. Each consisted of two wards of the borough and earlier vestry: 
*Bethnal Green North East (north and east wards)
*Bethnal Green South West (south and west wards).

In 1950, the borough&#x27;s representation was decreased to a single constituency of Bethnal Green, which in 1955 was expanded to also include three wards from the neighbouring Metropolitan Borough of Hackney.

==Population and area==
The area of the borough was . It included the districts now known as Bethnal Green, Cambridge Heath, Bow, Whitechapel and Shoreditch, stretching to include part of the Boundary Estate in the west and parts of Mile End Park and Victoria Park in the east. In the south its boundary stopped just short of The Blind Beggar pub on Whitechapel Road. The populations recorded in National Censuses were:

Bethnal Green Vestry 1801-1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900-1961
==Second World War==
During World War II, the Borough suffered from heavy aerial bombing. 
It is estimated that 80 tons of bombs fell on this area alone, affecting 21,700 houses, destroying 2,233 and making a further 893 uninhabitable. During the course of the aerial bombardment, 555 people were killed, and 400 were seriously injured.

<text>Ambystomatidae is a family of salamanders belonging to the Suborder Salamandroidea in the class Amphibia. It contains two genera, &quot;Ambystoma&quot; (the mole salamanders) and &quot;Dicamptodon&quot; (the Pacific giant salamanders). &quot;Ambystoma&quot; contains 32 species and are distributed widely across North America, while &quot;Dicamptodon&quot; contains four species restricted to the Pacific Northwest. These salamanders are mostly terrestrial and eat invertebrates, although some species are known to eat smaller salamanders. They can be found throughout the US and some areas of Canada in damp forests or plains. This family contains some of the largest terrestrial salamanders in the world, the tiger salamander and the coastal giant salamander. Some species are toxic and can secrete poison from their bodies as protection against predators or infraspecific competition. Neoteny has been observed in several species in Ambystomatidae, and some of them like the axolotl live all of their lives under water in their larval stage.

== Characteristics and Behavior ==
Ambystomatids have chunky bodies with broad, flat heads and short legs. Tails are long and flattened. Colors range from black, brown, or a dull grey and can have brightly colored speckles or spots. Their skin is smooth and shiny. Most adults lack gills/gill slits and moveable eyes. There are no nasolabial grooves on the snout. Lungs are well-developed and functional. They have 10 costal grooves. Adult males have 6 sets of cloacal glands. Adult females have spermathecae in cloaca. Ambystomatids are nocturnal. Although they are more active at night, they may be found on cool days under moist leaf litter, logs, or rocks near water bodies. 

The vomerine teeth, which are teeth only located on the upper jaw and in the front part of the mouth, are arranged essentially transversely, not parallel to the maxillary tooth row, which are the other teeth formed along the top jawbone; in mature metamorphosed individuals the dorsal premaxillary fontanelle, a pair of small cranial bones at the very tip of the upper jaw in many animals, is nearly or completely obliterated and the maxillae are not reduced (Tihen, 1969).

Adults tend to live in burrows and only return to waterbodies or streams to breed in early Spring. Fertilization is internal. Courtship occurs in water; males &quot;dance,&quot; nudging the females then deposit numerous spermatophores. Most species have a larval period that extends for 3–4 months. Ambystomatids can be found in temperate forests and wetlands.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Rhyacotriton&quot; was formerly included in this family, but is now usually placed into its own family Rhyacotritonidae. In 2006, a large study of amphibian systematics (Frost et al., Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, 297 (2006) placed &quot;Dicamptodon&quot; back within Ambystomatidae, based on cladistic analysis. This has been accepted by the Center for Indian Herpetology.

<doc id="381715" wikidata="Q1925826" url="?curid=381715" title="Metropolitan Borough of Poplar">
<text>Poplar was a local government district in the metropolitan area of London, England. It was formed as a district of the Metropolis in 1855 and became a metropolitan borough in the County of London in 1900. It comprised Poplar, Millwall, Bromley-by-Bow and Bow as well as Old Ford, Fish Island and Cubitt Town.

==Formation and boundaries==
The borough formed part of the then London suburbs and was bordered the metropolitan boroughs of Hackney, Stepney, and Bethnal Green to the west and north, and the county borough of West Ham then in Essex to the east. To the south, the River Thames formed borders with the metropolitan boroughs of Bermondsey, Deptford and Greenwich.

It was formed from three civil parishes: St Mary Stratford-le-Bow, St Leonard Bromley and All Saints Poplar. In 1907 these three were combined into a single civil parish called Poplar Borough, which was conterminous with the metropolitan borough. In 1965 the parish and borough were abolished, with their former area becoming part of the newly formed London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

It included the districts of (from north to south):

*Bow
*Bromley St Leonard
*Poplar
*Blackwall
*Isle of Dogs

==History==
In 1921 the borough council, under George Lansbury and the Poor Law Union were engaged in a dispute with the London County Council and central government over poor law rates – it wished to pay out of work people more than usually permitted; and to get wealthier West End boroughs to contribute to its expenses. Several councillors were imprisoned briefly in 1921 in relation to this. See Poplar Rates Rebellion.

In 1951 Poplar was chosen as the site of the Festival of Britain&#x27;s &#x27;Exhibition of Live Architecture&#x27;. The East End of London had been heavily bombed during the war and its reconstruction was showcased at the new Lansbury Estate. New building materials and planning concepts were demonstrated. The first example of &#x27;live architecture&#x27; on the exhibition trail was the Trinity Congregational Church and Hall, just across from the main reception area with their Town Planning and Building Research Pavilions on East India Dock Road. The trail continued with the Lansbury Estate and Chrisp Street Market.

The former Poplar Town Hall in Bow Road, designed by Culpin &amp; Son (1937–38), is now a listed building, as is its predecessor, the Old Town Hall (1870) in Poplar High Street.

==Population and area==
Poplar covered an area of . The population as given in the census from 1801 to 1961 was:

Constituent parishes 1801-1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900-1961
==Borough seal==

The borough had no coat of arms, using instead a seal originally designed for the Poplar District Board of Works, its predecessor, created by the Metropolis Management Act 1855. The seal depicted the emblems of the three parish vestries merged into the board.

The top shield was the seal of Poplar Vestry, and showed the &#x27;Hibbert Gate&#x27; of the old West India Docks, with a sailing ship on top of the shield. A similar representation of the gate and ship formed the head of the vestry&#x27;s civic mace, which was used by the board of works and borough council until 1965. The model ship from atop the gate, which was demolished in 1932, was placed by the borough council in Poplar Recreation Ground and Poplar Library before it collapsed.

The shield on the left was the seal of Bow Vestry, and showed a bridge between two bows. This represented the bow-shaped bridge over the River Lea.

The shield on the right was the seal of Bromley St Leonard Vestry, and depicts the saint dressed as a bishop.

There remain a number of street signs which have been preserved with the name of the former borough.

==Politics==
Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; however the parishes of Poplar District Board of Works did not exceed this number so were not divided into wards.

In 1880 the population had increased enough for the parish of All Saints Poplar to be divided into three wards (electing vestrymen): South (27), East (27) and West (30).

In 1885 the population had increased enough for the parish of Bromley St Leonard to also be divided into three wards (electing vestrymen): West (39), East (36) and South (33).

In 1894 the population had increased enough for the parish of St Mary Stratford Bow to be divided into four wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 (15), No. 2 (15), No. 3 (36) and No. 4 (18).

In 1894 as its population had increased the parish of All Saints Poplar was re-divided into four wards (electing vestrymen): Cubitt Town (15), Millwall (15), Blackwall (24) and West India Dock (30).

The metropolitan borough was divided into fourteen wards for elections: Bow Central, Bow North, Bow South, Bow West, Bromley Central, Bromley North East, Bromley North West, Bromley South East, Bromley South West, Cubitt Town, Millwall, Poplar East, Poplar North West and Poplar West.

===Borough council===

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was divided into two constituencies:
*Tower Hamlets, Bow and Bromley division
*Tower Hamlets, Poplar division
In 1918 the boundaries of the borough&#x27;s two seats were adjusted, and one was renamed:
*Bow and Bromley
*Poplar South
In 1950 the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to one seat:
*Poplar

<doc id="381716" wikidata="Q1925834" url="?curid=381716" title="Metropolitan Borough of Stepney">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Stepney was a Metropolitan borough in the County of London created in 1900. In 1965 it became part of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

==Formation and boundaries==
The borough was formed from thirteen civil parishes and extra-parochial places: Christchurch Spitalfields, Liberty of Norton Folgate (part), Mile End New Town, Mile End Old Town, Old Artillery Ground, Ratcliff, St Anne Limehouse, St Botolph without Aldgate, St George in the East, St John of Wapping, St Mary Whitechapel, St Paul Shadwell and Tower of London.

In 1901 Tower of London was merged with St Botolph without Aldgate. In 1921 Ratcliff, St John of Wapping and St Paul Shadwell were merged with St Anne Limehouse; and Christchurch Spitalfields, Liberty of Norton Folgate, Mile End New Town, Old Artillery Ground and St Botolph without Aldgate were merged with St Mary Whitechapel. In 1927 the remaining four civil parishes were combined into a single civil parish called Stepney, which was conterminous with the metropolitan borough.

Previous to the borough&#x27;s formation it had been administered by four separate local bodies: Limehouse Board of Works, Whitechapel Board of Works, Old Town Vestry and St George in the East Vestry.

The area maps roughly to the London postcode E1.

The road sign in front of Mile End tube station and a street sign on Leman Street in Aldgate still have the wording &quot;Borough of Stepney&quot; just visible on them.

==Borough seal and coat of arms==

On the formation of the metropolitan borough the corporation adopted a seal depicting the patron saints of the parishes that made up the borough. These were St Anne, Limehouse, St Mary Matfelon, Whitechapel, St Dunstan, for Stepney and St George in the East. In the centre was a depiction of the Tower of London. At the top of the seal was a sailing ship, recalling the legend that all persons born on the high seas, could claim Stepney as their birthplace. The more modern ship and quayside at the bottom of the seal was for the borough&#x27;s docks. On the left of the seal was a picture of a steam locomotive, for the London and Blackwall Railway, and on the right a loom for the historic weaving industry.

In 1931 the seal was replaced by an official coat of arms, granted by the College of Arms. The main item on the shield is a ship on the waves of the sea, for the various maritime interests of Stepney. At the top of the shield are shown a version of the arms of the City of London, but with an anchor replacing the sword in the city&#x27;s arms. On either side of this were placed smith&#x27;s tongs, symbol of St Dunstan, patron saint of Stepney. The crest on the top of the helm featured a mural crown, representing the battlements of the Tower of London. Atop the crown were two crossed gold anchors. The Latin motto: &quot;A magnis ad maiora&quot;, can be translated as &quot;from great things to greater&quot;. When Stepney became part of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, the arms of the new borough were based on Stepney&#x27;s, and an English-language version of the motto was adopted.

==Population and area==
The area of the borough was . The populations recorded in National Censuses were:

Constituent parishes 1801-1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900-1961
==Politics==

The borough was divided into nineteen wards for elections: Centre, Limehouse North, Limehouse South, Mile End New Town, North East, North, Ratcliffe, Shadwell, South East, South, Spitalfields East, Spitalfields West, St George in the East North, St George in the East South, The Tower, West, Whitechapel East, Whitechapel Middle and Whitechapel South.

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington was a metropolitan borough in the County of London between 1900 and 1965 when it became part of the London Borough of Hackney.

==Formation and boundaries==

===Predecessor authorities===
The borough was the successor to two local authorities: the vestry of Stoke Newington parish in the County of London and the South Hornsey Urban District Council in Middlesex.

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 Stoke Newington had been grouped with the neighbouring parish of Hackney under the administration of the Hackney District Board of Works. The union with Hackney was very unpopular with the inhabitants of Stoke Newington, and following unsuccessful attempts to end it in 1864, 1880 and 1890, the parish regained independence in 1894. Stoke Newington Vestry consisted of 60 vestrymen, elected from five wards.

South Hornsey formed the southern part of the parish of Hornsey, consisting of the Brownswood Park area south of Finsbury Park, of Clissold Park and two detached areas entirely surrounded by the parish of Stoke Newington. The exclaves of South Hornsey effectively cut off the south-eastern section of Stoke Newington from the rest of the parish. A local board was formed to govern the area in 1867, becoming an urban district under the Local Government Act 1894.

===Formation===
The London Government Act 1899 provided that the County of London should be divided into metropolitan boroughs. The new authorities were to based on existing parishes with simplified boundaries. It was intended that each borough would have a population of between 100,000 and 400,000 inhabitants. Where an area fell below the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants, it might still be constituted a borough if it had a rateable value exceeding 500,000 pounds.

Stoke Newington presented a problem, as its population fell well below the prescribed limits. It was recognised that there were three possibilities: to recombine the parishes of Hackney and Stoke Newington into a single borough; to divide the existing parish of Hackney and combine the wealthier northern section with Stoke Newington to form a municipality with the boundaries of the Hackney North parliamentary constituency; or to add neighbouring areas of Middlesex to increase the population.

The first two options were rejected due to the experience of &quot;intolerable and interminable feuds&quot; between the districts when they were previously &quot;forced together&quot;, and because the First Lord of the Treasury, Arthur Balfour recognised that there was &quot;great ill-feeling and mutual ill-will... between the inhabitants of the two districts&quot;; it was therefore decided to merge the bulk of South Hornsey, with a population about 20,000, with Stoke Newington. While this still created a borough of only about 50,000 inhabitants, and thus &quot;the smallest borough in London, the anomaly would be a gradually diminishing one, because the population in this district was rapidly increasing. When dividing London up into boroughs they could not avoid creating some anomalies as to size.&quot;

===Boundaries===
Under the 1899 legislation, boundary commissioners were appointed to set the boundaries of the new boroughs. The existing parish boundaries frequently divided houses or related to field boundaries that had disappeared with the urbanisation of the area. The commissioners realigned the boundary lines so that for the most part they ran down the centre of roads, railways or watercourses.

To the north, the borough had a boundary with Middlesex, marked by the course of the New River and the Seven Sisters Road. Stoke Newington&#x27;s boundaries with the two neighbouring metropolitan boroughs within the County of London were as follows:
*Islington to the west and south: the centres of Blackstock Road, Mountgrove Roads, Green Lanes, (diverting to take in Petherton Road and Leconfield Road) Matthias Road and Boleyn Road.
*Hackney to the east and north east: the centre of the ancient Ermine Street, known here as Kingsland High Street, Stoke Newington Road and Stoke Newington High Street, then following the North London Railway from Stoke Newington railway station to Bethune Road. (The area to the east of the main road, including Stoke Newington Common, never formed part of Stoke Newington administratively, lying within the parish of Hackney).

==Coat of arms==
 The long association with the dean and chapter of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral is represented by the red background and crossed swords. The cross is from the arms of William Patten, first lord of the manor and rebuilder of the church of St Mary, in 1550. The trees represent the ancient forest, and the green lion, that of John Dudley. The griffin refers to Daniel Defoe, and the banner, the arms of Sir Thomas Abney.

The Latin motto translates as &quot;Look to the past and the future&quot;, the arms were granted on 12 June 1934.

When merged to found the London Borough of Hackney in 1965, oaks from these arms were put in the new coat of arms of the London Borough of Hackney.

The coat of arms of 1934 replaced an unofficial device adopted by the council on incorporation in 1900. At the top of the shield was a representation of the parish church. The lower part of the shield featured the arms of the cities of London and Westminster on the left, and the attributed arms of the Kingdom of Essex representing Middlesex on the right. These armorial devices were chosen to represent the union of Stoke Newington in the County of London and South Hornsey in Middlesex. The crest was formed by a tree, recalling Stoke Newington&#x27;s origin as a village in the Middlesex Forest.

==Population and area==
Constituent parishes 1801-1900&lt;br&gt;Statistics compiled by the London County Council, in 1901 show the population growth in London, over the preceding century. The figures compiled by the council for 1891 do not agree with those that appear in the census reports, however which gave a population of 47,988 for the area.

Metropolitan Borough 1900-1961&lt;br&gt;The area of the parish of Stoke Newington was in 1891. Following the addition of most of South Hornsey and the boundary adjustments with Hackney and Islington, the area of the borough in 1901 was . The populations recorded in National Censuses were:

==Politics==

===Incorporated vestry===
In 1891 as its population had increased the parish of St Mary Stoke Newington was divided into five wards (electing vestrymen): Lordship (15), Church (15), Manor (12), Clissold (9) and Palatine (9).

===Borough council===
The borough council consisted of 30 councillors and 5 aldermen. In 1900 the boundary commissioners divided the borough into six wards for the election of councillors:&lt;br&gt;
The first council elected consisted entirely of &quot;Non-Party&quot; candidates, although &quot;The Times&quot; noted that they were &quot;Conservative in character&quot;. The entire council continued to be described as Independent or Non-Party until the 1934 election when the Labour Party gained 13 seats to the Independents&#x27; 17. Labour gained control of the council in 1945, taking all of the seats on the council. The Conservative Party first ran in the 1949 election, winning control from Labour by 23 seats to 7.

The wards of the borough were redrawn in 1953, with the area divided into ten wards, each electing three councillors. This reflected the change in settlement in the area, in particular the construction of new estates of council flats, including the London County Council&#x27;s large Woodberry Down development which housed about a seventh of the borough&#x27;s population. The names of the wards, a number of which were named after famous residents of Stoke Newington, were as follows:
*Brownswood
*Church

*Clissold
*Defoe

*Lordship
*Manor

*Milton
*Palatine

*Wilberforce
*Woodberry
Labour regained power at the 1953 election with 24 seats to 6 Conservatives. They held control at subsequent elections, taking all the seats in 1959. The final election of the council on 10 May 1962 saw four Liberal Party councillors elected to form an opposition group to the 26 Labour members.

===Parliamentary constituency===
Until 1918 the area formed part of the constituency of Hackney North. In 1918 a new constituency of Stoke Newington identical with the metropolitan borough was created. Due to loss of population, the two constituencies were merged in 1950 as Hackney North and Stoke Newington.

<doc id="381718" wikidata="Q1925828" url="?curid=381718" title="Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch was a metropolitan borough of the County of London between 1899 and 1965, when it was merged with the Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington and the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney to form the London Borough of Hackney.

The borough was made up of three main districts, Shoreditch, Hoxton and Haggerston, and covered some of the traditional East End of London. An individual coat of arms was never granted to the metropolitan borough council; they adopted the arms of the second lord of the manor of Shoreditch, John de Northampton.

==Boundaries==
The borough was in east London and comprised the area of the ancient parish of Shoreditch (St Leonard&#x27;s) plus part of the ancient liberty of Norton Folgate to the south The parish vestry had taken on local administration from the 17th century onwards.

==Civic buildings==
The civic buildings of the borough included the Town Hall (originally the Vestry Hall) in Old Street with the Magistrates Court (derelict in 2007), the Coroner&#x27;s Court in Boundary St and other civic offices nearby.

==Motto==
The borough motto commemorates the provision of electric power to the borough from the &quot;Vestry of St Leonard Shoreditch Electric Light Station&quot; later known as the &quot;Shoreditch Borough Refuse Destructor and Generating Station&quot; on Coronet Street. The building on Coronet Street is embellished with the motto E PULVERE LUX ET VIS (Out of the dust, light and power). It was built in 1896 and burned rubbish, to provide steam for the electricity generator. The waste heat was used to heat the public baths next door (and now demolished). The building is now home to the National Centre for Circus Arts.

==Population and area==
The metropolitan borough was conterminous with the Vestry authority, when it was formed in 1900. Statistics compiled by the London County Council, in 1901 show the population growth in London, over the preceding century.

The area of the borough in 1901 was . The populations recorded in National Censuses were:

Shoreditch Vestry 1801-1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900-1961

By comparison, after amalgamation with Hackney and Stoke Newington, to form the modern London Borough of Hackney, the combined area became 19.06 km² - approximately ; in 2005, this had a population of 207,700, or a population density of 10,900/km². In 1901 Shoreditch the population density was 44,600/km².

==Coat of arms==
The borough used coat of arms, but these were never formally granted and, therefore, not official. When the borough was merged to found the London Borough of Hackney, other charges were used to represent Shoreditch in the new coat of arms of the London Borough of Hackney.

==Politics==

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; as such the incorporated vestry of St Leonard Shoreditch was divided into eight wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 or Moorfields (18), No. 2 or Church (21), No. 3 or Hoxton (21), No. 4 or Wenlock (18), No. 5 or Whitmore (12), No. 6 or Kingsland (12), No. 7 or Haggerstone (9) and No. 8 or Acton (9).

The metropolitan borough inherited these eight wards for elections: Acton, Church, Haggerston, Hoxton, Kingsland, Moorfields, Wenlock and Whitmore.

===Borough council===

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was divided into two constituencies:
*Haggerston
*Hoxton
In 1918 the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to one seat:
*Shoreditch
In 1950 the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to half a seat, when it was merged with Finsbury:
*Shoreditch and Finsbury

<text>Thomas Moore Raworth (19 July 1938 – 8 February 2017) was an English-Irish poet, publisher, editor, and teacher who published over 40 books of poetry and prose during his life. His work has been translated and published in many countries. Raworth was a key figure in the British Poetry Revival.

==Life and work==
===Early life===
Raworth was born on 19 July 1938 in Bexleyheath, Kent, and grew up in Welling, the neighbouring town. His family maintained its strong Irish connections while he was growing up, something which would leave an impression on Raworth&#x27;s sense of himself as a poet. His mother&#x27;s family lived in the same house in Dublin as Seán O&#x27;Casey at the time that the playwright was working on &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot;. When he was 52 years old, Raworth acquired an Irish passport.

He was educated at St. Stephen&#x27;s Primary School, Welling, Kent (1943–1949); St Joseph&#x27;s Academy, Blackheath, London S.E.3. (1949–1954); and at the University of Essex (1967–1970), where he earned a Master&#x27;s degree in 1970. He left school at the age of sixteen and worked at a variety of jobs. According to Raworth: 

Beginning in the early 1960s, with the magazine called &quot;Outburst&quot;, Raworth started his professional publishing career, when he published a number of British and American poets including Ed Dorn, Allen Ginsberg, and LeRoi Jones. He also founded Matrix Press at this time, publishing small books by Dorn, David Ball, Piero Heliczer, and others. In 1965, while working as an operator at the international telephone exchange, Raworth and Barry Hall set up Goliard Press, which published, amongst others, Charles Olson&#x27;s first British collection. These ventures into publishing made an important contribution to a new found British interest in the New American Poetry movement of the 1960s.

Raworth was considered &quot;a particularly transatlantic writer, living in the US for several years in the seventies&quot; and is considered to be part of the Pop Art movement; in line with this, his poetry is sometimes, according to Ken Edwards, &quot;punctuated by graphics&quot; and in it there is a &quot;transgression of the boundaries between the written word, the visual and the aural.&quot; Furthermore, Raworth&#x27;s connection to American poetry through his work as an editor and publisher, established his American reputation in the U.S., often considered unequalled by any other British poet of that time period.

===Poetry and publications===
Raworth&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Relation Ship&quot; (1966), won the Alice Hunt Bartlett Prize. Raworth attended the University of Essex from 1967–70, under the aegis of Donald Davie who ran the literature department there. According to Raworth, he studied Spanish at the University of Essex, as he worked toward a B.A. in Latin American Literature. But after the first year, he transferred to the Masters program and in 1970 was awarded an M.A. in the Theory and Practice of Literary Translation.

In the 1970s, he worked in the United States and Mexico, first teaching in universities in Ohio, Chicago and Texas, and later living in San Francisco where he was involved with the Zephyrus Image press. After six years abroad he returned with his family to England in 1977 to take up the post of resident poet in King&#x27;s College, Cambridge for a year.

Raworth&#x27;s early poetry showed the influences of the Black Mountain and New York School poets, particularly Robert Creeley and John Ashbery, together with strands from European poetry (Apollinaire), Dada, and Surrealism. His 1974 book &quot;Ace&quot; showed that Raworth had moved to a more disjunctive style in his work. This style was reflected in short, unpunctuated lines that lead the reader into following multiple syntactic possibilities, and where it is &quot;increasingly impossible to keep track of the profusion of meanings on offer.&quot; Raworth&#x27;s &quot;poetic line&quot; can knit together anything from observations of the everyday to self-reflexive commentary on the acts of thinking and writing, to lifts from pulp fiction and film noir, to political satire:

What followed was a series of long poems in this particular mode —after &quot;Ace&quot; came &quot;Writing&quot; (composed 1975–77; published 1982), &quot;Catacoustics&quot; (composed 1978–81; published 1991) and &quot;West Wind&quot; (composed 1982–83; published 1984). Subsequent projects have extended this mode into a kaleidoscopic sequence of 14-line poems (not exactly &quot;sonnets&quot;) that extended through &quot;Sentenced to Death&quot; (in &quot;Visible Shivers&quot;, 1987), &quot;Eternal Sections&quot; (1993) and &quot;Survival&quot; (1994). Later collections include &quot;Clean &amp; Well Lit&quot; (1996), &quot;Meadow&quot; (1999), &quot;Caller and Other Pieces&quot; (2007), and &quot;Let Baby Fall&quot; (2008).

Raworth&#x27;s 550-page &quot;Collected Poems&quot; was published in 2003. Although a number of major poems still remained uncollected at the time, much of these uncollected works were, subsequently, published during the years since the &quot;Collected Poems&quot; appeared: beginning with &quot;Windmills in Flames&quot; (2010). Whatever didn’t make it into the latter publication, found its way into &quot;Structures from Motion&quot; and &quot;As When&quot;, both published in 2015. A book of Raworth&#x27;s prose, &quot;Earn your Milk&quot;, was published in 2009. The latter included all of his uncollected prose, and included his &quot;uncategorizable prose-work&quot;, long out-of-print: &quot;A Serial Biography&quot; (1969), which has been described as an &quot;assembly of memoir and reportage.&quot;

Several boxes of Raworth&#x27;s notebooks, typescripts, and correspondence (ca. 1968–1977) are held at the University of Connecticut&#x27;s Dodd Research Center.

==Reception and influence==
Over the years, since his work began appearing in the 1960s, Raworth had more than 40 books of his own work published, including pamphlets of poetry, prose and translations. Raworth gave regular readings of his work throughout the course of his life, in Europe and the U.S. In time, he even gave readings in China and Mexico. He made a number of recordings and videos during the course of his career. Raworth&#x27;s readings had their own &quot;signature style,&quot; which was specifically noted for the speed of his delivery, something David Kaufmann has described as &quot;breakneck speed.&quot; Kaufmann writes that when Raworth &quot;gives live readings, he runs roughshod over the line breaks, thus making it impossible for the reader to rest with what she has just heard.&quot;

Raworth was also interested in collaborative work. This was reflected in the many performance events and texts he created in collaboration with musicians such as Steve Lacy, Joëlle Léandre, Giancarlo Locatelli, Peter Brötzmann and Steve Nelson-Raney; other poets, including Jim Koller, Anselm Hollo, Gregory Corso, Dario Villa and ; and painters including Joe Brainard, Jim Dine, Giovanni D&#x27;Agostino and Micaëla Henich.

In 1991, he was the first European writer in 30 years to be invited to teach at the University of Cape Town.

In 2007, Raworth was awarded the prize for lifetime achievement, in Modena, Italy. Some of his other awards included the Cholmondeley Award, and the Philip Whalen Memorial Award.

His visual art consists mainly of drawings, collage and found object art and was exhibited in Italy, France, South Africa, and the United States.

As fellow poet Catherine Wagner has pointed out, Raworth was an &quot;inventor of dozens of ingenious and provocative forms,&quot; and so was an important influence on a succession of poets that have followed him. At the time of his death, he was considered by many to be, arguably, the finest British poet of his generation.

==Death==
Raworth was plagued by ill health for most of his life. In the 1950s, he was one of the first patients ever to survive open heart surgery. In the autumn of 2016, he began cancer treatments, but on 23 January 2017 he wrote the final entry on his blog:

Raworth died on 8 February 2017 at the age of 78. He is survived by his wife Val Raworth who said: &quot;Tom died this afternoon, peacefully, his family around him. A release from his sufferings.&quot;

<doc id="381729" wikidata="Q652156" url="?curid=381729" title="Lachine Rapids">
<text>The Lachine Rapids () are a series of rapids on the Saint Lawrence River, between the Island of Montreal and the South Shore. They are confusingly located near the borough of Lasalle and not Lachine.
The Lachine Rapids contain large standing waves because the water volume and current do not change with respect to the permanent features in the riverbed, namely its shelf-like drops. Seasonal variation in the water flow does not change the position of the waves, although it does change their size and shape. The rapids are about in length.
In the past these represented a considerable barrier to maritime traffic. Until the construction of the Lachine Canal through Montreal, the rapids had to be portaged. Even with the canal, the difficulty was such that it was usually more convenient to ship goods by rail to Montreal, where they could be loaded at the city&#x27;s port. Montreal remains a major rail hub and one of Canada&#x27;s largest ports for that reason.

The Lachine Rapids are now passed by the South Shore Canal (Saint-Lambert and Côte Sainte-Catherine locks) of the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

== Wildlife ==
The rapids contain a number of islands used by migratory birds.

== History ==

The first European to see the rapids was Jacques Cartier, who sailed up the St. Lawrence River in 1535, believing he had found the Northwest Passage. In 1611, Samuel de Champlain named the rapids Sault Saint-Louis, after a teenaged crewman named Louis who drowned here; the name later extended to Lac Saint-Louis. This name remained in use until the mid-19th century, but later came to be replaced by the name of the adjacent town of Lachine. The name &quot;Lachine&quot; itself is derived from the French name for China - La Chine.

The first Europeans known to have traveled above these rapids were Champlain and Étienne Brûlé on 13 June 1611. Brûlé continued upriver to live among the Algonquin, while Champlain himself would not travel further up the Ottawa River until May 1613. Louis Jolliet&#x27;s July 1674 canoe accident in the rapids destroyed his official report on the existence of the Mississippi River, and raised the standing of his fellow explorer Jacques Marquette. 

The first person to design a ship capable of shooting the Lachine Rapids was shipbuilder and carpenter John McQuaid, a native of County Armagh, Ireland who later settled in Kingston, Ontario with his family.

== Recreation ==
Whitewater rafting and jet boat expeditions to the rapids are available in Montreal. Whitewater kayaking has become popular, along with river surfing, on a standing wave adjacent to the Habitat 67.().

The city maintains Des Rapids Park which doubles as bird sanctuary and a place for visitors to appreciate the rapids.

<text>Lawrence Edwin Craig (born July 20, 1945) is an American retired politician who served in the United States Senate representing Idaho from 1991 to 2009 and in the U.S. House of Representatives representing Idaho&#x27;s 1st District from 1981 to 1991. A Republican, his 28 years in Congress rank as the second-longest in Idaho history, trailing only William Borah, who served over 32 years in the Senate.

Born in Council, Idaho, Craig was raised on a ranch in Washington County. He attended the University of Idaho, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the university in 1969, and later briefly attended George Washington University before returning to Washington County in 1971 to work in his family&#x27;s ranching business. Following a brief stint in the Idaho Army National Guard, Craig ran for and won a seat in the Idaho Senate in 1974, and was re-elected in 1976 and 1978, before his successful first run for Congress to represent Idaho&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the House of Representatives in 1980. He won reelection four times before running for the U.S. Senate in 1990, defeating Ron J. Twilegar in the general election and winning reelection in 1996 and 2002.

On June 11, 2007, Craig was arrested for indecent behavior in a men&#x27;s restroom at Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport; he pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct in August 2007 and paid $575 in court fines and fees. The arrest remained unknown to the public until the Washington, D.C.–based newspaper &quot;Roll Call&quot; disclosed it in an article, drawing widespread public attention as well as charges of hypocrisy against Craig, as he had been an opponent of LGBT rights in the United States. Despite stating that he was not and never had been homosexual, Craig announced, on September 1, 2007, that he would resign from the Senate, effective September 30, 2007, but later reversed this decision and decided to finish the remainder of his term, although he chose not to run for re-election in 2008.

He was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor and former Governor Jim Risch, who won the seat in the 2008 election. Craig subsequently co-founded the consulting firm New West Strategies and became a lobbyist. Craig has been a member of the board of directors of the National Rifle Association of America since 1983. Craig was inducted into the Idaho Hall of Fame in 2007.

==Early life and family==
Craig was born in Council, Idaho, the son of Dorothy Lenore (née McCord) and Elvin Oren Craig. He grew up on a ranch outside Midvale in Washington County. In 1969 he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Idaho. At the University of Idaho, he was student body president and a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. He pursued graduate studies at George Washington University before returning to his family&#x27;s Midvale ranching business in 1971. Craig was a member of the Idaho Army National Guard from 1970 to 1972, attaining the rank of Private First Class (E3), after which he received an honorable discharge.

Craig married Suzanne Scott in July 1983 and adopted the three children she had from a previous marriage. Through his adopted children, Craig has nine grandchildren.

==Political career==
Craig was elected to the Idaho Senate in 1974 and reelected in 1976 and 1978.

In 1980, Craig was elected to an open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Idaho&#x27;s 1st Congressional District. He succeeded Republican Steve Symms, who was leaving the House to run for election to the Senate against incumbent Democrat Frank Church. Craig was re-elected four times, serving until 1991. While in the House, he supported President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s push to expand vocational education. Craig was not a major force as a legislator during his time in the House.

Allegations of cocaine use and sex with male teenage congressional pages by unnamed congressmen were pursued by investigators and journalists in 1982. Craig issued a statement denying involvement. Craig stated &quot;Persons who are unmarried as I am, by choice or by circumstance, have always been the subject of innuendos, gossip and false accusations. I think this is despicable.&quot; Craig served on the House Ethics Committee. In 1989 Craig was reported to have led an extended effort that pushed for more severe punishment of Representative Barney Frank for his involvement in a gay prostitution scandal.

===U.S. Senate===
Craig announced his candidacy for the 1990 Senate election for the seat vacated by the retiring James A. McClure. Craig defeated Idaho Attorney General Jim Jones in the Republican primary. In the general election he defeated Democratic former Idaho Legislature member Ron J. Twilegar with 61 percent of the vote.

In 1995, Craig formed a barbershop quartet called The Singing Senators with Senators Trent Lott, John Ashcroft, and Jim Jeffords.

Craig was reelected in 1996, with 57 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Walt Minnick. He was reelected again in the 2002 election with 65 percent of the vote, when he spent $3.2 million to defeat Alan Blinken.

In 1999 Craig became sharply critical of U.S. President Bill Clinton for the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Speaking on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet The Press&quot;, Craig told Tim Russert: &quot;The American people already know that Bill Clinton is a bad boy – a naughty boy. I&#x27;m going to speak out for the citizens of my state, who in the majority think that Bill Clinton is probably even a nasty, bad, naughty boy.&quot;

Craig served as Senate Republican Policy Committee chairman from 1997 until 2003. He then became chairman of the Special Committee on Aging. After the Democrats gained control of the Senate in the 2006 Congressional election, Craig became the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs and a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He served as the ranking member of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. Amid the controversy surrounding his arrest, in August 2007 Craig temporarily stepped aside as ranking member on the Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee and two subcommittees.

Craig is a longtime advocate for a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution.

In May 2003, Craig put a hold on more than 200 Air Force promotions in an attempt to pressure the Air Force to station four new C-130 cargo planes in Idaho, saying he received a commitment from the Air Force almost seven years earlier that the planes would be delivered. Defense Department officials said the reason the C-130s had not been sent to Idaho was that no new aircraft were being manufactured for the type of transport mission done by the Idaho Air National Guard unit where Craig wanted the planes delivered.

Craig supported the guest worker program proposed by President George W. Bush. In April 2005, Craig tried to amend an Iraq War supplemental bill with an amendment that would have granted legal status to between 500,000 and one million illegal immigrants in farm work. The amendment failed with 53 votes (60 votes were needed because the amendment was not relevant to the underlying bill). A version of the AgJOBS legislation was included in the Senate-passed immigration reform bill in 2006. Craig, the principal sponsor of AgJOBS, continues to support amnesty for illegal immigrants who are &quot;trusted workers with a significant work history in American agriculture.&quot; This position has been sharply criticized by anti-illegal immigration activists. On June 26, 2007, Craig reiterated his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007.

In October 2005, Craig suggested that flooded sections of New Orleans should be abandoned after Hurricane Katrina had hit and was quoted on a Baton Rouge television station as saying that &quot;Fraud is in the culture of Iraqis. I believe that is true in the state of Louisiana as well.&quot;

On December 16, 2005, Craig voted against a cloture motion filed relative to the USA PATRIOT Act; the motion ultimately earned only 52 votes, and so a Democratic filibuster against extension of the act (due to expire at the end of 2005) was allowed to continue. On December 21, 2005, Craig backed a six-month extension of the Act while further negotiations took place. On February 9, 2006, Craig announced an agreement among himself, the White House, and fellow Senators John E. Sununu, Arlen Specter, Lisa Murkowski, Chuck Hagel and Richard Durbin to reauthorize the Act.

In 2006, Craig posted to his Senate website all the earmarks he had inserted into federal spending bills since joining the Senate Appropriations Committee in 1998.

The American Conservative Union rated Craig&#x27;s 2005 voting record at 96 out of 100 points, while the Americans for Democratic Action rated him at 15 points. Craig supported the Federal Marriage Amendment, which barred extension of rights to same-sex couples; he voted for cloture on the amendment in both 2004 and 2006, and was a cosponsor in 2008. However, in late 2006 he appeared to endorse the right of individual states to create same-sex civil unions, but said he would vote &quot;yes&quot; on an Idaho constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages when pressured to clarify his position by the anti-gay rights advocacy group Families for a Better Idaho. Craig voted against cloture on a 2002 bill which would have extended the federal definition of hate crimes to cover sexual orientation. This legislation was passed in 2007 in both the House and the Senate as the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. Craig voted against the measure. The LGBT advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign issued guides to candidates&#x27; voting records in 2004, giving Craig a 0 rating.

Prior to the nomination of Idaho Governor Dirk Kempthorne, Craig was mentioned as a possible candidate to succeed Gale Norton as United States Secretary of the Interior in March 2006.

In June 2012, the Federal Election Commission sued Craig for repayment of $217,000 of campaign funds which he used to pay for his defense in his criminal case. In an August 2012 filing, Craig&#x27;s lawyer Andrew Herman wrote &quot;Not only was the trip itself constitutionally required, but Senate rules sanction reimbursement for any cost relating to a senator&#x27;s use of a bathroom while on official travel&quot;; the filing cited an FEC ruling that allowed former Congressman Jim Kolbe to use campaign funds for his legal defense in the Mark Foley scandal. A federal court in Washington, D.C. found him liable for the full sum, and on March 4, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment.

In 2014, Craig was the Idaho Republican Party financial chair.

==2007 arrest and consequences==

On June 11, 2007, Craig was arrested at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport for lewd conduct in a men&#x27;s restroom, where he was accused of soliciting a male undercover police officer for sexual activity. During the resulting interview with the arresting officer, Craig insisted upon his innocence, disputing the officer&#x27;s version of the event by stating that he merely had a &quot;wide stance&quot; and that he had been picking up a piece of paper from the floor.

Craig was charged with interference with privacy, a gross misdemeanor offense, and a disorderly conduct misdemeanor. Despite his statements of innocence during the police interview, Craig pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct by signing and mailing a plea petition, dated August 1, 2007, to the Hennepin County District Court. Including fines and fees, he paid $575. Craig signed the petition to enter his guilty plea, which contained the provisions, &quot;I understand that the court will not accept a plea of guilty from anyone who claims to be innocent... I now make no claim that I am innocent of the charge to which I am entering a plea of guilty.&quot; Craig mailed his signed petition to the court, and his petition to plead guilty to the misdemeanor charge was accepted and filed by the court on August 8, 2007. In an August 28, 2007 press conference, Craig regretted filing the guilty plea, stating &quot;In hindsight, I should not have pled guilty. I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously&quot;.
At a news conference on September 1, 2007, Craig announced his intent to resign, &quot;with sadness and deep regret&quot;, effective September 30, 2007. On September 4, 2007, a spokesperson for Craig indicated that he was reconsidering his decision to resign, if his conviction was rapidly overturned and his committee assignments were restored. The following week, Craig&#x27;s attorneys filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing that it &quot;was not knowing and intelligent and therefore was in violation of his constitutional rights.&quot; The motion was ultimately denied, upholding the initial guilty plea. The controversy forced Craig to step down from his position as liaison to the Senate on the Romney campaign. Craig vehemently denied wrongdoing, saying &quot;I am not gay. I never have been gay.&quot;

Following the ruling, Craig announced that despite his previous statements to the contrary, he would serve out his Senate term. He stated that he intended to &quot;continue my effort to clear my name in the Senate Ethics Committee—something that is not possible if I am not serving in the Senate.&quot; Craig did not seek reelection in 2008 and left office on January 3, 2009.

Both the 2009 documentary &quot;Outrage&quot; and the magazine &quot;Newsweek&quot; (June 7, 2010 issue) listed Craig, among others, as a conservative politician with a record of anti-gay legislation who was caught in a gay sex scandal.

In a lawsuit by the Federal Election Commission, it was determined that he improperly paid his attorneys in this matter from his campaign funds, and Craig was ordered in 2014 to pay the Treasury $242,535. On March 4, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment.

===Post-Senate===
After his retirement, Craig opened the consulting firm New West Strategies with his former chief of staff Mike Ware, focusing on energy issues. The consulting firm shut down in 2019.

<doc id="381734" wikidata="Q1718234" url="?curid=381734" title="Lachine Canal">
<text>The Lachine Canal (, ) is a canal passing through the southwestern part of the Island of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, running 14.5 kilometres (9 miles) from the Old Port of Montreal to Lake Saint-Louis, through the boroughs of Lachine, Lasalle and Sud-Ouest.

Before the canal construction there was a lake, Lac St-Pierre or or Petit Lac St-Pierre. The lake and its rivers can be seen on the maps of Montreal of the years 1700, 1744 and on the map titled &quot;The isles of Montreal. As they have been surveyed by the French engineers&quot; (1761). The lake is now filled in and located near the Turcot Interchange on Autoroute 20.
The canal gets its name from the French word for China (). The European explorers sought to find a route from New France to the Western Sea, and from there to China and hence auspiciously the region where the canal was built was named Lachine.

Due to the continuous disposal of industrial waste, the canal contains harmful substances, though the water quality is said to be good.

==History==
The area of the canal is a traditional meeting place between the various indigenous groups of the region, the Algonquin, Huron and Iroquois. Suggestions for a possible canal to bypass the Lachine Rapids dated back to the time of early explorers such as Samuel de Champlain. Settlers and trade had to make a long portage to continue upstream of Montreal.

Interest in constructing a canal picked up after the land for the canal was granted by the King of France to the Sulpician Order, who held a monopoly on grain on the island. Beginning in 1689, attempts were made by the French Colonial government and several other groups to build a canal. The first construction in 1689 was intended to bring water to the flour mills of the Sulpicians and increase the flow of goods. The project stopped after an attack in August 1689 by the Iroquois. After a peace treaty was made between the French and the Iroquois in 1701, there was hope by the Sulpicians that the canal project would be restarted. However, the Sulpicians had neither the capital nor the financial resources to restart the project.

After Quebec became a British colony, tensions between Quebec and the new United States led to the construction of small canals between Montreal and the Great Lakes. After the War of 1812, there was a hightenede interest in a canal to bypass the rapids and facilitate the transfer of goods in the region on larger boats.

After more than 130 years of failure, a consortium that included the young Scottish immigrant John Redpath was successful. John Richardson was Chairman of the Committee of Management of the canal project and its chief engineer was Thomas Brunett. The contractors were Thomas McKay and John Redpath, plus the firms of Thomas Phillips &amp; Andrew White and Abner Bagg &amp; Oliver Wait.

The Lachine Canal was built to bypass the rapids at Lachine, upstream of Montreal. Freight and passengers destined for points past Lachine had to portage the 8 or 9 miles from Montreal&#x27;s port to the village of Lachine where they could resume their trip by boat.

Work on the canal commenced on July 17, 1821, under Chief Engineer Thomas Burnett and Construction Engineer John Richardson. The original canal was long and had seven locks, each long, wide and deep. The new canal officially opened in 1825, helping turn Montreal into a major port and eventually attracting industry to its banks when the Society of Sulpician Order decided to sell lots.

During the 1840s, under Chief Engineer Charles Atherton, the Lachine Canal was deepened to allow heavier ships to pass through and hydraulic power was introduced to the industries on its banks. Through the enlargement of the canal, its use changed from solely a means of avoiding the Lachine rapids to that of an industrial region within Montreal. There were two major effects on the development of Montreal due to the enlargement of the Lachine Canal. The first was that by creating a route that bypassed the Lachine rapids and therefore opened the upper St Lawrence River to navigation, Montreal became a more convenient area for trade, effectively taking away shipping traffic from Quebec City and moving it to Montreal.

The second important shift that can be noted through the growth and development of the canal is the creation of industrial suburbs. Before the Lachine Canal, Montreal&#x27;s industrial region was in what would be considered the downtown area.
The impact of the Lachine Canal on Montreal during the mid- to late 1800s can be seen through the emergence of new working-class neighbourhoods such as Griffintown, St Henri, Pointe St Charles. Furthermore, the population of Montreal grew by over four times between the mid-1800s to the early 1900s.

One of the main reasons behind the growth of the Lachine Canal region was the access to hydraulic power which was provided through the deepening of canal in the 1840s. Throughout the mid to late 1800s, industries all along the banks of canal experienced consistent growth through the access to this energy source. By the end of the 1800s, factories began to utilize steam powered factories as opposed to hydraulic power.

The top three manufacturing industries in Montreal were wood, iron, and steel. In 1871 these three sectors made up 60% of the total Canadian manufacturing production. Other industries that had factories along the canal were the leather industries and the garment industries, which apart from the leather industry all increased.

As wood was on the decline and industries were growing at a much faster pace, iron and steel were still the dominant industries. By World War II, industries needed more water to power their machines, and the hydraulic system was not providing enough power. Many of the factories needed another source of power. The new source of power came from coal. With the Grand Trunk Railway on hand at Point St. Charles, industries were able to import coal from many different sources. They were able to import coal from Nova Scotia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and across the ocean from Great Britain. The Lachine Canal was extremely busy acting as a hub for the city of Montreal.

Although this switch did not initially affect the Lachine Canal region in a negative manner, factories were no longer dependent on the canal as an energy source. Industries now had the option of building further and further away from the canal itself, which was also helped by the development of a railway system throughout Montreal&#x27;s industrial region.

However, while the Lachine Canal proved an enormous boon for Montreal and the Province of Quebec, time would show that for Canada&#x27;s Maritime Provinces, it was the first major nail in that region&#x27;s economic coffin.
The first enlargements took place between 1843 and 1848, under the supervision of Alfred Barrett. Five new locks, each long, wide and deep replaced the original seven locks. A second enlargement of the canal took place between 1873 and 1885, at which time the locks were lengthened to and deepened to .

The main reason for the second enlargement came from complaints from industrialists who wanted more power generated from the canal. They complained about the speed of the current being too slow. The second enlargement was meant to fix these problems.

Soon after the opening of the Lachine Canal in 1825, many of Montreal&#x27;s merchants convinced the city&#x27;s government to set up a harbour commission. One of the presidents of the harbour commission was John Young. Under Young&#x27;s orders the canal was deepened so that the canal would be able to have bigger boats pass through.

Railway transportation proved to be very important for Montreal. The Grand Trunk Railway had its workshop in Point. St. Charles. This proved to be very important for the Lachine Canal because its workshop in Point St. Charles provided a link to the Atlantic during the winter months. It was the door to the rest of the Grand Trunk railway line that went from Toronto to Maine. Because the Lachine Canal was the link between the ocean and the interior of Canada and America, it was a major centre for transportation.

The canal continued to operate successfully until around 1950, but then, surrounded by the industrial developments which it helped to create, it could not be expanded further to cope with the continuing increase in vessel size. The canal became obsolete in 1959, being replaced by the St. Lawrence Seaway, which opened that year. The canal was finally closed to shipping in 1970. The opening of the Seaway and the decline of shipping on the canal led to the devastation of the neighbourhoods that lined the canal in Montreal&#x27;s &quot;Le Sud-Ouest&quot; borough due to shifting patterns of industrial development and shipping.

The lower section of the Lachine canal was entirely filled in between 1965 and 1967 and closed to commercial navigation in 1970 and reopened to pleasure craft in 2002.

== Current canal ==
The current canal has a guaranteed draught of and the clearance under bridges is .

==Locks==

Since 1848, the canal has had 5 locks: Lachine, Côte-Saint-Paul, Saint-Gabriel and 2 locks at Old Port of Montreal. But initially it had seven locks:
*Lachine (1 lock),
*Côte-Saint-Paul (2 locks in 1825, 1 since 1848)
*Saint-Gabriel (1 lock)
*Old Port of Montreal (3 locks in 1825, 2 since 1848).

==Lachine Canal National Historic Site==
The canal has been designated as a National Historic Site of Canada, officially named the Lachine Canal National Historic Site of Canada. The Fur Trade at Lachine National Historic Site is located near the western end of the canal.

==Development==


At its zenith from 1880 to 1940, the industrial and manufacturing area adjacent to the canal was once the largest in Canada in terms of both the number of firms and diversity of its output. At one time, over 20% of the workforce of the Island of Montreal was employed in its factories. Given its historic importance, the &quot;Lachine Canal Manufacturing Complex&quot; was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1996, in addition to the designation already enjoyed by the canal itself.

The Lachine Canal fell victim to deindustrialization. Many of the factories that lined the Lachine Canal were torn down and replaced by houses and apartments. By 1990 there was the feeling that the area&#x27;s industrial history was being forgotten. In response, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board named the Lachine Canal &quot;Lachine Canal Manufacturing Complex&quot;. The area was renovated after Parks Canada took over the Administration.

Atwater Market was built as a public works project during the depression era. The site was originally the William Rutherford lumberyard. The building has served many purposes, but it has been a market since 1982.

Over the last two decades, the canal has seen a large increase in residential and commercial development. In what was originally a very heavy industrial neighbourhood, Pointe-Saint-Charles and Saint-Henri have become very up and coming districts. House values have skyrocketed and many real estate developers have turned the century-old industrial factories and warehouses, like that of Dominion Textiles (5524 Saint-Patrick, now Complexe Dompark) &amp; Simmons Bedding Company (4710 St-Ambroise, now Complexe Canal Lachine) into loft buildings. Complexe Dompark recently celebrated its 100th anniversary and now houses more than 90 multimedia, fashion, publishing and service industry-based companies in custom designed lofts. The area around the Atwater Market has become one of Montreal&#x27;s most desirable residential areas for condo owners. Much of this is thanks to the continued effort to clean up the Canal.

The old Redpath Sugar refinery at the corner of Saint Patrick Street and Rue de Montmorency is now partially Lofts Redpath, converted after being abandoned since 1980.

==Recreation==

The Lachine Canal became obsolete when the St. Lawrence Seaway opened up. The last of the industries still using the Canal system ended in 1970.

Managed by Parks Canada, the Lachine Canal reopened in 2002 as a pleasure boating area. They offers a wide array of activities such as kayaking, canoeing, paddleboarding and initiation to camping. A bike path also runs along the entire canal, which in 2009, placed third on Time Magazine&#x27;s list of the top 10 urban bike paths in the world.

A member of the Republican Party, Crapo served as the U.S. representative for Idaho&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1993 to 1999. He is the dean of Idaho&#x27;s congressional delegation, having served since 1993.

Born in Idaho Falls, Crapo is a graduate of Brigham Young University and Harvard Law School. He practiced law in his home city throughout the 1980s, while also maintaining an active role in local Republican politics. His brother Terry Crapo was majority leader in the Idaho House of Representatives from 1968 to 1972 and an influential political figure until his death from leukemia in 1982. After his brother&#x27;s death, Crapo was elected to the Idaho Senate in 1984. He served as Senate president pro tempore from 1988 to 1992.

Crapo was elected to an open seat in Congress in 1992, representing Idaho&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives. After three terms in the House, he ran for the open seat in the U.S. Senate in 1998 when Dirk Kempthorne vacated it to run for Idaho governor. Crapo was elected with 70% of the vote, and became the first member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to represent Idaho in the Senate. In 2004, he defeated his only opponent, write-in Democratic candidate Scott McClure, with 99% of the vote. He was reelected in 2010, 2016, and 2022.

==Early life and education==
Crapo was born on May 20, 1951, in Idaho Falls, Idaho, to Melba (née Olsen) and George Crapo. He became an Eagle Scout in 1966. Crapo earned a B.A., &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, in political science from Brigham Young University in 1973 and a J.D., &quot;cum laude&quot;, from Harvard Law School in 1977.

==Early political career==

After graduating from law school, Crapo served for one year as a law clerk to Judge James M. Carter of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. He then returned to Idaho to practice as a lawyer, joining his brother Terry Crapo&#x27;s law firm of Holden Kidwell Hahn &amp; Crapo in Idaho Falls. In the 1980s, he became active in the Republican Party&#x27;s campaigns for seats in the state legislature. His brother served in Idaho House of Representatives for four years as majority leader (1968 to 1972) and was considered a rising star in Idaho politics. After Terry&#x27;s death from leukemia in 1982, Mike ran for an open seat in the Idaho Senate. He was elected to the State Senate in 1984, where he served until 1992. In 1988, Senate President &quot;pro tempore&quot; Jim Risch unexpectedly lost reelection to the Idaho Senate, and Crapo was elected by his colleagues to the president&#x27;s position. He served as senate president &quot;pro tempore&quot; from 1988 to 1992.

On January 27, 1989, Crapo served as acting governor of Idaho for 12 hours while Governor Cecil D. Andrus was out of the state testifying before Congress and Lieutenant Governor Butch Otter was out of the state on business for his employer, Simplot. Andrus, a Democrat, left Crapo a note saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t do anything I wouldn&#x27;t do. ... P.S. The chair is comfortable, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;

Crapo was elected to Congress in 1992, representing Idaho&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. He served three terms from 1993 to 1999. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998.

==U.S. Senate==

===Elections===
Crapo was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998. He succeeded fellow Republican Dirk Kempthorne, who retired after one term to run for governor. In his Senate bid, as in his House campaigns, Crapo&#x27;s campaign made signs that had a macron placed over the &quot;a&quot; in his name (Crāpo) to indicate its correct pronunciation (&quot;Cray-poe&quot;).

Crapo was reelected in 2004 with 99.2% of the vote, with the other .8% going to a write-in candidate, Democrat Scott McClure.

In 2010, Crapo was reelected to a third term with 71% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee P. Tom Sullivan and Constitution Party nominee Randy Bergquist.

In 2016, Crapo was reelected to a fourth term with 66% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Jerry Sturgill and Constitution Party nominee Ray Writz. In October 2016, after the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording came to light, Crapo said he would not vote for Trump. He later reversed that decision.

===Tenure===

====1990s====
On February 12, 1999, Crapo was one of 50 senators to vote to convict of impeachable offenses and to remove Bill Clinton from office.

====2000s====
In the 111th Congress, Crapo served on the following Senate committees: Banking, Housing and Urban Development; Budget; Environment and Public Works; Indian Affairs; and Finance. He co-chairs the Senate Nuclear Caucus, the Canada-U.S. Inter-parliamentary Group (IPG); the COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) Caucus, which he founded; and the Congressional Sportsmen&#x27;s Caucus.

Crapo became the state&#x27;s senior senator when the 111th United States Congress convened on January 3, 2009, succeeding Larry Craig, who decided not to seek reelection. At the convening of the 112th United States Congress, Crapo ranked 39th in seniority in the Senate.

He opposed President Barack Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation, voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

====2010s====
In April 2013, Crapo was one of 46 senators to vote against a bill that would have expanded background checks for all gun buyers. He voted with 40 Republicans and 5 Democrats to stop passage of the bill.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Crapo became &quot;something of a hero among advocates of bipartisanship&quot; for his involvement in the &quot;Gang of Six&quot;.

In 2017, Crapo was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.

Crapo&#x27;s view on senatorial responsibilities for Supreme Court nominees has evolved. Of President George W. Bush&#x27;s 2006 nomination of Samuel Alito, Crapo said in a press release, &quot;All of the President&#x27;s nominees deserve up-and-down votes and not efforts to obstruct judicial nominees for political purposes. Judges are not politicians, and hopefully, Judge Alito&#x27;s nomination will put an end to the politics which have crept into the nomination process.&quot; By contrast, in 2016, his press release regarding President Obama&#x27;s nomination of Merrick Garland to replace the late Antonin Scalia said:

The Constitution gives the President the right to make nominations to the Supreme Court, with the advice and consent of the Senate. As part of its role in this process, the Senate may, at its discretion, withhold consent. The next Supreme Court justice will make decisions that affect every American and shape our nation&#x27;s legal landscape for decades. Therefore, the current Supreme Court vacancy should be filled by an individual nominated by the next President of the United States.

====2020s====
In September 2020, with less than two months to the next presidential election, Crapo voiced support for an immediate Senate vote on Trump&#x27;s nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by the death of justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, once a &quot;well-qualified candidate&quot; was put forth.

For his tenure as the chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee during the 116th Congress, Crapo was given an &quot;F&quot; grade from the non-partisan Lugar Center&#x27;s Congressional Oversight Hearing Index.

On January 6, 2021, Crapo was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol. In response, he called for &quot;perpetrators&quot; to be &quot;prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law&quot;. He opposed removing Trump from office, saying that the &quot;country is too divided&quot; and that invoking the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution &quot;would only make matters worse&quot;.

In October 2023, Crapo visited China as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Crapo said he would raise concerns about market-access on behalf of Micron Technology, which faced restrictions in China. The delegation also met Foreign Minister Wang Yi, National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee Chairman Zhao Leji, and Shanghai Communist Party Secretary Chen Jining.

==Political positions==
Crapo is considered politically conservative. The American Conservative Union&#x27;s Center for Legislative Accountability gives him a lifetime conservative rating of 91.30. Americans for Democratic Action gave him a liberalism score of 5 out of a possible 100 in 2020.

===Abortion===

Crapo is anti-abortion. In 1998, he supported a bill that made it illegal for minors to cross state lines to get abortions in order to avoid parental consent laws. In 2009, he voted to restrict UN funding for population control policies. Crapo praised the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in June 2022.

===Energy===

Crapo is a proponent of nuclear energy. He supports the nuclear energy projects at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and helped work on the nuclear-related Senate bills known as the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act (NEICA) and the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (NEIMA). The former bill helped establish the National Reactor Innovation Center at the INL.

===Gun law===
In 2012, Crapo said that more gun control regulations would not curb violence in the United States. He also said that he supported efforts to improve mental health access rather than more gun laws.

Crapo has received multiple &quot;A+&quot; ratings from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA) for his voting record on causes supported by the NRA. The same year, he joined 12 other senators vowing to filibuster any attempts by Democrats to introduce additional gun control regulations in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Crapo also supported legislation to make open carry legal in National Parks.

In January 2017, the NRA praised Crapo for introducing the Hearing Protection Act, which would make access to gun silencers easier.

In response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Crapo called for &quot;solidarity&quot; and praised first responders. The Hearing Protection Act bill was tabled in wake of the shooting.

===United States Capitol attack===
On May 28, 2021, Crapo voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.

===Veteran Affairs===
On August 2, 2022, Crapo was one of only 11 senators to vote against the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, a bill to expand VA health care and benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances.

===Fiscal policy===
Crapo was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.

In 2024, Crapo argued that proposed Republican tax cut extensions do not need to be offset with measures to prevent the tax cuts from adding to the deficit.

==Personal life==
Crapo married Susan Diane Hasleton in June 1974, and they have five children. He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Crapo was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1999 and underwent a radical prostatectomy in January 2000. He had a full recovery and was declared cancer-free. In 2005 he had a recurrence of prostate cancer, and underwent a series of radiation treatments. He has become active in advocating early detection tests for cancer and other treatable diseases. Crapo has also pushed to create a federal Office of Men&#x27;s Health.

Crapo is an Eagle Scout, awarded in 1966. He received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (DESA) in 2000.

On January 4, 2013, Crapo pleaded guilty to DUI in connection with a December 2012 incident and received the standard punishment for a first-time offender in Virginia. He issued a public apology just after his arrest, and various Idaho media outlets criticized him in light of his religion&#x27;s temperance tenets.

<text>Michael Bradley Enzi ( ; February 1, 1944 – July 26, 2021) was an American politician who served in the United States Senate from Wyoming as a member of the Republican Party from 1997 to 2021. Prior to his tenure in the United States Senate he served as mayor of Gillette, Wyoming, in the Wyoming House of Representatives from Campbell County, and the Wyoming Senate from the 24th district. He was the longest-serving senator from Wyoming since Francis E. Warren.

Enzi was born in Bremerton, Washington, raised in Thermopolis, Wyoming, and educated at Sheridan High School, George Washington University, and the University of Denver. He served in the Air National Guard, and held positions in the American Legion Boys State, DeMolay International, and United States Junior Chamber. He entered politics with his election as mayor of Gillette after being convinced by Alan Simpson to run and defeating incumbent Mayor Cliff Davis. He was elected to the state house in the 1986 election and served until his appointment to the state senate in 1991.

Enzi was elected to the United States Senate in the 1996 election after defeating future senator John Barrasso in the Republican primary and Secretary of State Kathy Karpan in the general election. During his tenure in the Senate he served as chair (or else ranking member) of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and Budget committees. He served in the Senate until Cynthia Lummis succeeded him in the 2020 election after his retirement. He died in 2021 following injuries resulting from a bicycling accident.

==Early life and education==

Michael Bradley Enzi was born on February 1, 1944 in Bremerton, Washington, to Elmer J. Enzi and Dorothy Bradley. He was raised in Thermopolis, Wyoming, and graduated from Sheridan High School in 1962. He graduated from George Washington University with a degree in accounting in 1966 and from the University of Denver with a Master of Business Administration in retail marketing in 1968. He served in the Wyoming Army National Guard from 1967 to 1973. On June 7, 1969, he married Diana Buckley, with whom he had three children, and moved to Gillette, Wyoming.

Enzi was criticized by multiple people, including Wyoming Veterans of Foreign Wars Commander Bill Saunders, for attempting to equate his service in the Wyoming Army National Guard with that of those who served in the Vietnam War although Enzi stated that his comments were misinterpreted.

Enzi was elected to serve as a city councilor in the American Legion Boys State in 1961. He was selected serve as a junior councilor in the Wyoming DeMolay International organization in 1963. In 1970, Enzi was appointed to serve as vice-chair of the nine-member Public Health Nursing Advisory Committee in Gillette. He was elected to serve as president of the Wyoming United States Junior Chamber in 1973. He served as chair of the First Wyoming Bank-Gillette.

==Career==
===Local politics===
Enzi defeated Mayor Cliff Davis in Gillette&#x27;s 1974 mayoral election after having been convinced to run by Alan Simpson and won reelection without opposition in 1978. He announced on July 7, 1982, that he would not run for reelection.

He filled two vacant city council seats in one month in 1976, following the resignation of Ed Geringer and Jack Babcock with Jack Edmunds replacing Geringer and Robert White replacing Babcock. Gillette&#x27;s Planning and Zoning Commission was created during Enzi&#x27;s tenure, and he appointed six of the seven positions on the board upon its creation. A water pipeline was built during Enzi&#x27;s tenure as mayor and prior to its construction water was rationed in Gillette. During the 1978 United States House of Representatives elections he supported Treasurer Ed Witzenburger for the Republican nomination.

He was appointed to serve on the National League of Cities&#x27; community development committee. Enzi served as vice-president and president of the Wyoming Association of Municipalities. Enzi&#x27;s term as president of the Wyoming Association of Municipalities was meant to end in June 1983, but he left office in January so John Nickle was appointed to serve the remainder of his term.

===Wyoming Legislature===

Enzi ran for one of three seats in the Wyoming House of Representatives from Campbell County in the 1986 election as a Republican and was elected alongside incumbent Republican representatives Dick Wallis and John Hines. All three representatives won reelection in the 1988 election against Democratic nominee Rebecca Claar. All three representatives were reelected in the 1990 election against Democratic nominees Claar, Dave Stueck, and Chuck Tolar.

Enzi was speculated as a possible candidate to replace John Ostlund in the Wyoming Senate in the 1978 election as Ostlund was running in the gubernatorial election, but he instead announced that he would run for reelection as mayor on July 17. Senator Kelly Mader resigned on December 9, 1991, due to him having moved his family to Denver, Colorado, and starting a business there and Enzi was selected to replace Mader on December 13, while David Shippy was selected to replace Enzi in the state house. He faced no opposition in the Republican primary or general election in 1992.

During his tenure in the state house he served on the Education, Corporations and Elections, and Mines and Minerals committees. He served on the Joint Appropriations committee and served as the chair of the Revenue committee in the state senate. He lost his position as chair of the Revenue committee and was replaced by Grant Larson in 1996, as senate rules prohibited statewide candidates from serving as chairs of committee.

===United States Senate===
====Elections====

Senator Simpson, who was first elected in 1978, announced on December 3, 1995, that he would not seek reelection in the 1996 election. Enzi announced on April 9, 1996, that he would run for the Republican nomination to succeed Simpson in the United States Senate. Enzi won a straw poll conducted at the state convention with 159 of the 457 votes. He went on to win the Republican primary, defeating eight other candidates; one of those candidates was John Barrasso, who would later be appointed to the Senate in 2007. Enzi garnered support due to his pro-life stance, while Barrasso, who had been expected to win the primary, identified as pro-choice at the time. Enzi defeated Democratic nominee Kathy Karpan in the general election.

Enzi announced on March 22, 2002, that he would run for reelection in the 2002 election. Dick Bratton served as his campaign chair. Enzi defeated Crosby Allen, a county commissioner from Fremont County, in the Republican primary and Democratic nominee Joyce Corcoran, the mayor of Lander, Wyoming, in the general election. During the 2002 election Enzi raised $1,443,925.00 and spent $1,130,628.00 compared to Corcoran who had raised $8,488.00 and spent $8,467.00. He defeated Democratic nominee Chris Rothfuss in the 2008 election.

Liz Cheney initially opposed Enzi in the Republican primary during the 2014 election, but polling showed that Enzi would defeat her. Cheney dropped out of the race, citing family health concerns. He defeated Democratic nominee Charlie Hardy and independent candidate Curt Gottshall in the election.

On May 5, 2019, Enzi announced that he would not seek reelection in the 2020 election. Cynthia Lummis won the Republican nomination and defeated Democratic nominee Merav Ben-David in the general election. He was the longest-serving senator from Wyoming since Francis E. Warren.

====Tenure====

During Enzi&#x27;s tenure in the Senate he served on the Labor and Human Resources, Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committees. In 2001, he was given Jim Jeffords&#x27; position on the Foreign Relations committee after Jeffords left the Republican Party to become an independent. Enzi served as chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and Budget committees. He also served as chair of the Banking Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance, and the Labor Subcommittee on Employment, Safety, and Training.

Scott Ratliff, a former member of the Wyoming House of Representatives, served on Enzi&#x27;s staff for issues about the Wind River Indian Reservation.

In 1997, Enzi asked to be allowed to bring his laptop onto the Senate floor as it was easier than carrying multiple briefcases, but the Senate rules prohibited all mechanical devices that could distract senators unless the Sergeant at Arms ruled that those devices were necessary and proper for the conduction of official business. Sergeant at Arms Gregory S. Casey conducted a three-month study and said that the rules of the Senate allowed members to use laptops on the floor, but not if they were connected to an outside network. Senator John Warner, the chair of the Rules Committee, sent the report to all 100 senators for consideration in September. Robert Torricelli opposed allowing laptops onto the floor stating that it would lead to staff instructing senators how to vote and Robert Byrd also opposed it stating that the sound of typing would be irritating. Senators Wendell Ford, Dianne Feinstein, and Kay Bailey Hutchison also opposed allowing laptops onto the floor. On November 5, the Rules Committee voted against allowing Enzi to bring his laptop onto the floor with Rick Santorum being the only member voting to allow laptops onto the floor. All personal electronic devices are still prohibited from the floor.

During the 2000 presidential election he praised George W. Bush&#x27;s selection of Dick Cheney as his vice-presidential running mate stating that Cheney was &quot;an outstanding selection&quot; and that he was &quot;excited not just for Wyoming, but for the whole country&quot;. Following Trent Lott&#x27;s resignation Enzi lobbied for Bill Frist to become the Majority Leader of the Senate.

He was given the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 1999, making him the first Wyomingite to receive the award, after being nominated by the Central Wyoming Council and the Boy Scouts of America. Enzi and Representative Cliff Stearns were awarded the Stuart Symington award, given for outstanding civilian contribution in the field of national security, by the Air Force Association, which was their highest civilian award, for co-founding the Congressional Air Force Caucus.

==Death==
On July 23, 2021, Enzi broke his neck and multiple ribs in a bicycling accident near his home in Gillette. He was flown to a hospital in Loveland, Colorado, where he died on July 26.

==Political positions==
Enzi opposed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, voted to sustain a filibuster against it stating that it violated the First Amendment rights of interest groups to contribute money in 1997 and 1998, and voted against the legislation while sixty members of the Senate voted in favor of it in 2002. He returned campaign contributions given to him by Enron following their scandal. In 2000, Enzi asked Senator William Roth, the chair of the Finance Committee, to implement geographic equity for Medicare spending in order to give money to rural healthcare.

===Crime and guns===

While in the state legislature Enzi and Senator John Perry cosponsored legislation to make the assault and battery of people above the age of sixty-five a high misdemeanor. He supported capital punishment. Enzi asked Attorney General Janet Reno to make assisted suicide illegal as the Drug Enforcement Administration had ruled. He voted against the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006.

Enzi initially supported the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act to reduce crimes committed by juveniles, but withdrew his support stating that the legislation infringed on the Second Amendment. During the votes on amendments to the Juvenile Justice Enforcement Act he voted against requiring background checks for firearms sales at gun shows and flea markets, regulating the transfer of firearms through the internet, and banning the importation of high capacity ammunition magazines. Enzi was one of two senators who voted against an amendment to the Juvenile Justice Enforcement Act which prohibited juveniles from purchasing or possessing assault-style semi-automatic weapons without the consent of a parent.

Enzi was given repeated &quot;A&quot; ratings by the NRA Political Victory Fund. Enzi introduced legislation in 2001, which would have required law enforcement to destroy the records created by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of people who passed a background check for a gun purchase.

Enzi supported the creation of an amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag of the United States. In 2000, the Senate voted sixty-three to thirty-seven, with Enzi in favor, in favor of an amendment prohibiting flag desecration, but it failed to receive a two-thirds majority. In 2006, the Senate voted sixty-six to thirty-four, with Enzi in favor, in favor of an amendment prohibiting flag desecration, but it failed to receive a two-thirds majority.

===Economics===

In 1994, the state senate voted twenty-nine to one, with Enzi as the only vote against, in favor of placing a moratorium on the sale of state land. Enzi voted against an amendment to raise the minimum wage by $1 over the course of two years in 1998. In 1999, Enzi and twenty-two other senators wrote a letter to Clinton asking him to implement tariffs to protect lamb production in the United States. He supported a ruling by the United States International Trade Commission which would allow tariffs on wheat imports from Canada.

Enzi supported the creation of a balanced budget amendment and stated that without the amendment the president could use &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot; to circumvent requirements for a balanced budget. Enzi was given a Taxpayer&#x27;s Friend award by the National Taxpayers Union in their 1999 report. Enzi opposed the estate tax and criticized Clinton for vetoing legislation to phase out the estate tax at the federal level over the course of ten years.

Enzi opposed a ballot initiative that would allow counties in Wyoming to legalize gambling and he served as director of Wyomingites for a Better Economy Today and Tomorrow which opposed the initiative. Enzi introduced an amendment to legislation for the United States Department of the Interior&#x27;s spending in the Senate to prohibit the approving of new Native American casinos without state approval. The Arapaho and Shoshone tribes criticized Enzi for introducing the legislation without consulting them. He later asked for Bruce Babbitt to overstep his authority as Secretary of the Interior for tribal gambling issues. Ron Allen, the president of the National Congress of American Indians and chair of the Klallam tribe, criticized Enzi for attempting to limit the power of Native Americans to negotiate gambling contracts with the federal government.

===Environment===

Enzi and Senator Byrd co-sponsored a resolution calling for President Bill Clinton to not sign global climate agreements if they harmed the interests of the United States or if they failed to include developing nations with the resolution being in response to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Enzi opposed the Kyoto Protocol and he attended the conference where the participants did not agree with his the United States Senate&#x27;s view on climate change. The Public Interest Research Group gave Enzi a zero percent rating for votes on environmental legislation conducted between March 1997 and March 1998. He supported drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Enzi was given a zero percent rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America in its 1997 report. He was given a F rating by the NAACP in 2002. Enzi cosponsored a resolution expressing support for Judge Roy Moore&#x27;s attempts to have the Ten Commandments displayed in his courtroom.

Enzi led the effort to create the Sacagawea dollar to honor Sacagawea and replace the Susan B. Anthony dollar despite other members of the Senate who wanted the coin to depict the Statue of Liberty, Clara Barton, Shirley Chisholm, Rosa Parks, Pocahontas, or another figure. Enzi wrote a letter to Treasurer Robert Rubin asking for the coin to be unveiled at Fort Washakie. Enzi opposed the creation of federal hate crime legislation and attempts by President Clinton to expand federal hate crime legislation. Wyoming later made the Sacagawea coin its official state coin.

Enzi supported legislation in the state senate to declare all same-sex marriages, including those conducted outside of the state, void in Wyoming. He supported the Boy Scouts exclusion of gay scouts and leaders and supported legislation to end federal aid to schools which prohibited the Boy Scouts due to their refusal to admit gay members. Enzi supported Santorum&#x27;s comments on Lawrence v. Texas in which Santorum stated that sodomy laws should be upheld. In 2004, the Senate voted fifty to forty-eight, with Enzi in favor, against the Federal Marriage Amendment which would have prohibited gay marriage. Enzi released a statement following the murder of Matthew Shepard in which he denounced the murder and expressed sympathy for his family, but he later voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

He opposed sending soldiers to Kosovo to participate in the Kosovo War and stated that &quot;there was no exit plan built in&quot;. Enzi voted to express Congressional approval for the prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Yugoslav Wars.

He voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001 and the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002. Enzi praised Bush&#x27;s 2003 State of the Union Address stating that he had made solid arguments against Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction and the need to disarm Iraq and later stated that Saddam Hussein must be overthrown to disarm Iraq. He stated that he still believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction despite no weapons of mass destruction being discovered following the invasion of Iraq.

Enzi opposed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty stating that the United States needed to test its nuclear weapons as one-third of the nuclear weapons were detected to have flaws from 1945 to 1992. He supported either amending or leaving the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

Enzi supported legislation to end the blockade on food and medicine sales and donations to Cuba in 1998, and later asked Bush to lift restrictions on selling American food and medicine to Cuba. Enzi stated that the United States Congress should not become involved with Elián González. In 2003, he and Senator Max Baucus called for travel restrictions to Cuba to be lifted. He and Senator Byron Dorgan introduced the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act with other Democratic and Republican senators to allow Americans to travel to Cuba in 2009, and supported other legislation to allow Americans to travel to Cuba.

===Impeachment===

The Senate voted seventy to thirty, with Enzi against, against calling Monica Lewinsky to testify in the impeachment trial of Clinton. He voted to convict Clinton on both articles of impeachment, but neither article received enough support to remove Clinton.

Enzi, along with 51 other Republican Senators, voted against convicting Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment in his first impeachment trial. As a result, Trump was acquitted of both articles.

<text>The Saab Sonett is an automobile manufactured by Swedish automaker Saab between 1955 and 1957 and again between 1966 and 1974. The Sonett share its engines and other mechanical components with the Saab 93, 95 and 96 of the same era. It was mainly intended for the lucrative American export market and was only offered intermittently in the Swedish domestic market for the 1968 and 1972 model years.

The first prototype, now known as the Sonett I, is a two-seat, open-top, lightweight roadster racer which, ten years later, evolved into the commercially distributed Sonett models II, V4, and III.

== Sonett I ==
In the 1950s, Rolf Mellde—a Saab engine developer and race enthusiast—along with Lars Olov Olsson, Olle Lindkvist, and Gotta Svensson, designed a two-seat roadster prototype in a barn in Åsaka, near Trollhättan (the site of the main Saab manufacturing facility). The limited research-and-development project, with a total budget of only , first came to be known as the Saab 94 but was later renamed as the &quot;Sonett&quot;, a name derived from the Swedish phrase (&quot;how neat it is&quot;, or more literally &quot;it&#x27;s so neat&quot;) by the car&#x27;s designer Sixten Sason. This name was initially rejected by Saab&#x27;s management but was eventually accepted in October 1955 when the first prototype was completed. The Sonnet shares a lot of components from the 93 Saloon such as the front suspension, engine and gearbox. The engine and gearbox were rotated 180-degrees and fitted behind the front axle. This required reversing the engine&#x27;s direction of rotation which was easily achieved due to the engine being a 2-stroke unit.

In order to avoid using a tubular frame chassis used by other low volume sports cars at the time, Mellde instead decided to use an advanced stressed skin-lightweight aluminium chassis that weighed less than . The metal sections of the chassis were riveted together, a concept used in aircraft manufacturing, while the mechanical components such as the engine, fuel tank, axles and body work were mounted directly onto the chassis. Mellde and Sason decided to use glass-reinforced plastic for the construction of the car&#x27;s body, a material which had little to no use in automobile manufacturing at the time. In order to manufacture the body of the car from this material, Soab, a company specializing in plastics imported from the United States based in Gothenburg was hired to make the said lightweight body shell.

The Sonnet was introduced on 16 March 1956 at Stockholm&#x27;s &quot;Bilsalong&quot; (motor show). Featuring a three-cylinder 748 cc two-stroke engine generating , the Sonett I was an advanced low-weight racer based on aircraft design concepts.

With a projected top speed of , the Sonett I had the prospect of success on the European race circuit, and a production run of 2,000 units was planned for 1957. However, the competition rules changed, permitting modified production cars into the race classes which Saab had envisioned for its purpose-built Sonett, and the economic and marketing viability of the project faded.

Only six cars were made between 1955 and early 1957, all right-hand drive units. The decision to build the Sonnet 1 was reversed by the Saab management in early 1958 who decided to build a performance-oriented variant of the 93 Saloon called the GT 750. The original prototype, known as &quot;No. 1&quot; and built with a manually crafted glass-reinforced plastic (GRP, or &quot;fiberglass&quot;) body, served as the reference model for the other five cars. An extremely rare vehicle, only two cars exist in the United States. Chassis number 2 was in the GM Heritage Center Collection but it was sold to Saab Cars North America (SCNA) after GM&#x27;s 2009 bankruptcy. After Saab, too, went bankrupt in 2012, it was sold on to the Saab Heritage Car Museum USA in South Dakota.

In September 1996, rally driver Erik Carlsson broke the Swedish record for the under–750-cc engine class with a speed of in the restored Sonett I prototype &quot;No. 1&quot;.

== Sonett II ==
In the early 1960s, Saab&#x27;s North American dealers managed to convince its management that a sports car would be a right choice to appeal to the US market as European sports cars, especially those from MG and Triumph were a huge success. The demands from the dealers included a targa top roof, wind-up windows, a heater as standard equipment and good handling. Saab decided to outsource the development of the project and two concept cars were built, the Saab MFI13 by Malmö Flygindustri which was designed by Björn Karlström, an aircraft and automotive illustrator, and Walter Kern, an engineer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Saab Catherina by Sixten Sason in his private design studio. The management ultimately accepted the MFI13 design proposal.

After some modifications, such as the adoption of a sheet metal box-frame chassis, the MFI13 was unveiled first at the 1966 New York Auto Show and the Geneva Motor Show. was put into limited production in 1966 as the &quot;Sonett II&quot;, manufactured at the Aktiebolaget Svenska Järnvägsverkstäderna (ASJ) in Arlöv. Inside Saab, it was designated model 97. A further 230 units were assembled in 1967, but as the two-stroke engine became increasingly uncompetitive in the US market due to emissions regulations, a switch to the Ford Taunus V4 engine was made in the middle of the 1967 production year, and the model was renamed the Sonett V4. Apart from the engine and related drivetrain, the Sonett II and Sonett V4 share much of their componentry and are distinguished from each other by a buldge on the hood of the V4, in order to accommodate the larger and taller engine. The additional weight did require some strengthening of the chassis and suspension pieces, and the wheels were half an inch wider than the four-inch units used on the Sonett II. The 1967 year holds the distinction of becoming the last 2 stroke engine passenger automobile sold new in the United States.

Like the Sonett I prototype, the Sonett II&#x27;s fiberglass body was bolted to a box-type chassis with an added roll-bar to support the hard top. The entire front hood section hinged forward to allow easy access to the engine, transmission, and front suspension. Equipped with a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine generating , the Sonett II achieved 0 to 100 km/h (0–62 mph) time of 12.5 seconds, with a top speed of . All Sonett IIs were left hand drive (LHD).
Designed as a race car, the Sonett II competed successfully against other small European sports cars, including the Austin-Healey Sprite and Triumph Spitfire, in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) races of the period. Due to low production volume, it was disqualified from certain competitions. By 1967, the two-stroke engine failed to meet US emission control standards. In 2011 a two-stroke Sonett II achieved at the Bonneville Salt Flats. Of the 28 Sonett IIs manufactured in 1966 all were equipped with 841 cc three cylinder two-stroke engines. SAAB produced serial numbers 29 through 258 with the two-stroke engine, serial number 259 was the first Sonett to have the V4 engine.

All Sonett II transmissions had a freewheel that could be engaged and disengaged while in motion via a pull handle down near the throttle pedal. The freewheel was required in the normal (non-oil pump engines) SAAB two stroke engines but not in the racing engines that had an oil injection system fed from a supply tank, nor in the Sonett V4 since it had a four-stroke engine with the common recirculating pressure lubrication.

The Škoda-engined ÚVMV 1100 GT was based on the Sonett II.

=== Sonett V4 ===
When Saab started using the Ford Taunus V4 engine in their 95, 96, and Monte Carlo models, an upgrade for the low-volume Sonett II became economically feasible. The &quot;Sonett V4&quot; was introduced with a Ford V4 engine in the middle of the 1967 model year starting with serial number 259. A new &quot;bulge&quot; hood, designed by Gunnar A. Sjögren, was required to clear the larger V4 engine, with a slight right offset to avoid obstructing the driver&#x27;s view. This asymmetrical hood shape, criticized by both the automotive press and within Saab itself, contributed to the motivation for the 1970 Sonett III redesign.

The Ford V4 engine produced , and—combined with the car&#x27;s lightweight chassis and fiberglass construction—allowed the V4 model to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 12.5 seconds, with a top speed of . The V4&#x27;s dashboard was wrinkle finished black, unlike the wooden panel used in the Sonett II.

Following the low-volume 1966–67 Sonett IIs, Saab ramped up Sonett V4 production to meet minimum SCCA requirements, assembling 70 units in the 1967 transition year, 900 units in 1968, and 640 units in the final 1969 production year—a total of 1,610 cars. The 1969 models can be recognized by their taller seat backs and by having a lid for the glove compartment, while the heater was also made somewhat more efficient.

While the Sonett V4 was assembled in Sweden, nearly the entire production was exported to the United States, with an MSRP of between US$3,200 and US$3,800 (US$ to US$ in today&#x27;s dollars). In addition to its unusual fiberglass body, the Sonett V4 featured advanced safety features for its day, including a roll bar, three-point seat belts, and high-back bucket seats to protect against whiplash injury. Sonett V4s also sported a few oddities compared to standard American sports cars like e.g. Corvette, such as front wheel drive; a freewheeling clutch that disengaged automatically whenever the accelerator pedal was no longer pressed, and a column-mounted shifter, rather than a typical floor-mounted shifter.

In spite of lackluster Saab marketing, unusual features, and quirky design, the Sonett V4 found a niche market in the US, propelled by successful SCCA racing performances of the Sonett II. Its primary competitors were British roadsters, including the MG Midget and MG MGB, the Triumph TR5, the TVR Grantura and the Austin-Healey Sprite Mark IV.

The Clean Air Act of 1970 prompted engineering modifications to the Ford V4 emission control system that were difficult to reconcile with the Sonett II/V4 body style which then led to the Sonett III redesign.

== Sonett III ==
The 1970 redesign of the Sonett V4, named the Sonett III, was initially given to the Italian automobile designer Sergio Coggiola in order to make the car look more appealing as the Sonett II had faced major criticism for its design. However, Saab tasked its own designer, Gunnar A. Sjögren in order to make the car fit the existing Sonett II chassis without the expensive manufacturing-line changes. A hinged rear-window glass replaced the Sonett II/V4 rear compartment hatch door. With the mandate for a &quot;bulge-less&quot; hood, the engine compartment opening evolved into a small front popup panel, resulting in more limited access than in the Sonett V4. Extensive engine work required the removal of the entire front hood section.
To help adapt the car to US market tastes, the Sonett III featured a floor-mounted shifter (instead of the Sonett V4&#x27;s column-mounted shifter) and optional dealer-installed air conditioning. The Sonett III&#x27;s hidden headlamps were operated manually using a lever. US safety regulations required new low speed impact proof bumpers after 1972, significantly detracting from its Italian-inspired design. All Sonett IIIs were Left-hand drive.

While the same 1500 cc Ford Taunus V4 engine as the Sonett V4 remained available for the 1970 and 1971 model years, emission control requirements reduced the available horsepower. From 1972 to 1974, the Sonett III used the 1700 cc Ford V4, but to meet increasingly strict federal regulations, net power output remained the same as the 1500 cc engine, at . Still, the Sonett III accelerated from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 13 seconds, and—due to a higher differential gear ratio (42 teeth on the ring gear and 9 teeth on the pinion gear) than the standard 95/96 transmission (39:8)—achieved a top speed of , aided by a drag coefficient of 0.31 cd.

Disappointing sales, especially during the 1973 oil crisis, led Saab to end production late in 1974. A total of 8,368 Sonett IIIs were manufactured between 1970 and 1974. 

By then the production total for models Sonett II, Sonett V4 and Sonett III had reached 10,236 units.

During that time Saab USA&#x27;s president Jonas Kjellberg was interested in creating a new generation of Sonett in collaboration with Reliant and styled by Tom Karen of Ogle Design, in a deal where the latter would design, engineer and assemble the car for the US market. However the project was brought to an end when the board at Saab rejected the proposals, when Kjellberg presented Reliant&#x27;s business plan for the new Sonett. 

SAAB also used the Sonett III for test builds powered by a Rankine cycle steam engine. One of the test cars survived and was at auction in Stockholm in July 2019.

== Cancelled PhoeniX concept ==
The Sonett name was planned to be revived as the production version of the Saab PhoeniX concept. Designed by Jason Castriota as an affordable halo car for Saab, it would have been a 2+2 sports car producing up to 400 hp in its highest form, and used the new Phoenix platform that would have underpinned the next generation 9-3 and 9-1 compact. These projects were cancelled with the dissolution of Saab in 2012.

<doc id="381745" wikidata="Q1138576" url="?curid=381745" title="Craig L. Thomas">
<text>Craig Lyle Thomas (February 17, 1933 – June 4, 2007) was an American politician who served as United States Senator from Wyoming from 1995 until his death in 2007. He was a member of the Republican Party. In the Senate, Thomas was considered an expert on agriculture and rural development. He had served in key positions in several state agencies, including a long tenure as Vice President of the Wyoming Farm Bureau from 1965 to 1974. Thomas resided in Casper for twenty-eight years. In 1984, he was elected from Casper to the Wyoming House of Representatives, in which he served until 1989.

In 1989, Dick Cheney, who occupied Wyoming&#x27;s only seat in the House of Representatives, resigned to become Secretary of Defense. Thomas became the Republican candidate to succeed Cheney and won the April 1989 special election. He was re-elected in 1990 and 1992, and in 1994 he ran for and won the Senate seat being vacated by fellow conservative Republican Malcolm Wallop of Sheridan in northeastern Wyoming. He was re-elected in 2000 and 2006, having easily beaten Democratic candidates in both elections with 70 percent of the vote.

==Family==
Thomas was married to Leona M. Francis on February 22, 1955, in Uinta, Wyoming. The couple had three sons and one daughter, as well as nine grandchildren. They later divorced. Thomas later married the former Susan Roberts, a public school teacher for special-needs students in Arlington, Virginia. 

==Biography==

Thomas graduated from the University of Wyoming in Laramie with a degree in animal husbandry. At the university he was a member of the Delta Chi Fraternity. Thereafter, he served as an officer in the United States Marine Corps from 1955 to 1959; he attained the rank of Captain. He obtained a law degree from La Salle Extension University, though he did not list it on later official biographies.

In addition to his work with the Farm Bureau, he was general manager of the Wyoming Rural Electrification Administration. After four years in the Wyoming House, Thomas won a special election on April 26, 1989, to replace Dick Cheney as Wyoming&#x27;s lone member of the United States House of Representatives. He resigned as a state representative effective May 2, 1989 and took his seat in the U.S. House on the same day. He was re-elected to that seat in 1990 and 1992. In 1994, he ran for the United States Senate and won, defeating popular Democratic Governor Mike Sullivan by 20 percentage points. He was elected second term in 2000 with a 74 percent majority, one of the largest margins in Wyoming election history. In the 2006 election he was opposed by Democratic engineer Dale Groutage. Thomas was re-elected to a third term with 70 percent of the ballots even as Democratic Governor Dave Freudenthal was also winning with the same 70 percent margin.

As chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee, Thomas authored legislation to provide funding and management reforms to protect America&#x27;s national parks into the 21st century. For this and other relevant legislation, Thomas was honored by the National Parks Conservation Association with their William Penn Mott Jr., Park Leadership Award, as well as the National Parks Achievement Award. As the senior member of the Senate&#x27;s influential Finance Committee, Thomas had been involved in issues such as Social Security, trade, rural health care, and tax reform. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Thomas was instrumental in passing the Central America Free Trade Agreement. As co-chair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, Thomas worked on legislation to improve health care opportunities for rural families.

==Illness and death==
Thomas entered the hospital shortly before the balloting occurred in November 2006 and was initially treated for pneumonia. Two days after the 2006 election, Thomas&#x27; diagnosis of leukemia was announced.
He immediately underwent treatment in the form of chemotherapy at the hospital and then returned to work in December, a month earlier than expected. In early 2007, Thomas said he was feeling better than he had in a long time, but he returned to the hospital for a second round of chemotherapy a month later. On June 4, 2007, Thomas was reported in serious condition, struggling with an infection while undergoing a second round of chemotherapy at Bethesda Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Thomas was pronounced dead that same day from complications of leukemia at 9:53 PM EST.

Thomas&#x27; services were held in the Methodist Church in Casper on June 9, 2007. The two Senate leaders, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), headed a delegation of some twenty members of Congress who came to pay respects to the deceased senator. Thomas&#x27; burial was in Riverside Cemetery in Cody on June 10.

Under Wyoming law, Governor Freudenthal was required to appoint a new senator from a list of three submitted by the Wyoming Republican Party&#x27;s central committee because the seat was vacated by a Republican. The GOP met on June 19, 2007, in Casper to select three candidates from thirty applicants to send to the governor. Tom Sansonetti, former state Treasurer Cynthia Lummis, and State Senator John Barrasso were nominated. On June 22, 2007, Governor Dave Freudenthal appointed Barrasso as Thomas&#x27;s successor in the U.S. Senate.

Thomas has been honored posthumously by having the Visitor Center in Grand Teton National Park named for him. The Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center, in Moose, Wyoming, was dedicated on August 11, 2007, with many dignitaries attending, including Vice President Dick Cheney.

<doc id="381750" wikidata="Q2509489" url="?curid=381750" title="Hilbert's sixteenth problem">
<text>Hilbert&#x27;s 16th problem was posed by David Hilbert at the Paris conference of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900, as part of his list of 23 problems in mathematics.

The original problem was posed as the &quot;Problem of the topology of algebraic curves and surfaces&quot; (&quot;Problem der Topologie algebraischer Kurven und Flächen&quot;).

Actually the problem consists of two similar problems in different branches of mathematics:
* An investigation of the relative positions of the branches of real algebraic curves of degree &quot;n&quot; (and similarly for algebraic surfaces).
* The determination of the upper bound for the number of limit cycles in two-dimensional polynomial vector fields of degree &quot;n&quot; and an investigation of their relative positions.

The first problem is yet unsolved for &quot;n&quot; = 8. Therefore, this problem is what usually is meant when talking about Hilbert&#x27;s sixteenth problem in real algebraic geometry. The second problem also remains unsolved: no upper bound for the number of limit cycles is known for any &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, and this is what usually is meant by Hilbert&#x27;s sixteenth problem in the field of dynamical systems.

The Spanish Royal Society for Mathematics published an explanation of Hilbert&#x27;s sixteenth problem.

== The first part of Hilbert&#x27;s 16th problem ==
In 1876, Harnack investigated algebraic curves in the real projective plane and found that curves of degree &quot;n&quot; could have no more than

:formula_1

separate connected components. Furthermore, he showed how to construct curves that attained that upper bound, and thus that it was the best possible bound. Curves with that number of components are called M-curves.

Hilbert had investigated the M-curves of degree 6, and found that the 11 components always were grouped in a certain way. His challenge to the mathematical community now was to completely investigate the possible configurations of the components of the M-curves.

Furthermore, he requested a generalization of Harnack&#x27;s curve theorem to algebraic surfaces and a similar investigation of surfaces with the maximum number of components.

== The second part of Hilbert&#x27;s 16th problem ==

Here we are going to consider polynomial vector fields in the real plane, that is a system of differential equations of the form:

:formula_2

where both &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are real polynomials of degree &quot;n&quot;.

These polynomial vector fields were studied by Poincaré, who had the idea of abandoning the search for finding exact solutions to the system, and instead attempted to study the qualitative features of the collection of all possible solutions.

Among many important discoveries, he found that the limit sets of such solutions need not be a stationary point, but could rather be a periodic solution. Such solutions are called limit cycles.

The second part of Hilbert&#x27;s 16th problem is to decide an upper bound for the number of limit cycles in polynomial vector fields of degree &quot;n&quot; and, similar to the first part, investigate their relative positions.

===Results===
It was shown in 1991/1992 by Yulii Ilyashenko and Jean Écalle that every polynomial vector field in the plane has only finitely many limit cycles (a 1923 article by Henri Dulac claiming a proof of this statement had been shown to contain a gap in 1981). This statement is not obvious, since it is easy to construct smooth (C∞) vector fields in the plane with infinitely many concentric limit cycles.

The question whether there exists a finite upper bound &quot;H&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) for the number of limit cycles of planar polynomial vector fields of degree &quot;n&quot; remains unsolved for any &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1. (&quot;H&quot;(1) = 0 since linear vector fields do not have limit cycles.) Evgenii Landis and Ivan Petrovsky claimed a solution in the 1950s, but it was shown wrong in the early 1960s. Quadratic plane vector fields with four limit cycles are known. An example of numerical visualization of four limit cycles in a quadratic plane vector field can be found in. In general, the difficulties in estimating the number of limit cycles by numerical integration are due to the nested limit cycles with very narrow regions of attraction, which are hidden attractors, and semi-stable limit cycles.

In his speech, Hilbert presented the problems as:

<doc id="381761" wikidata="Q620182" url="?curid=381761" title="Aldwych">
<text>Aldwych (pronounced ) is a street and the name of the area immediately surrounding it, in the City of Westminster, part of Greater London, and is part of the West End Theatreland. The street starts east-northeast of Charing Cross, the conventional map centre-point of the capital city. 

In the 7th century, the area was an Anglo-Saxon settlement. The name means &quot;old port&quot;, and was the port of the City of London.

==Current Use==
The semi-circular design of the street of Aldwych arises from its function, making navigable the gradient of the fall in levels between the roads connected by the street: the south end of Kingsway, and the Strand.
It forms part of the A4 road from London to Avonmouth, Bristol.

The Aldwych area forms part of the Northbank business improvement district. It is known for hotels, restaurants, two theatres, the High Commissions of India and Australia. It gives its name to the now-closed Underground station on the related section of the Strand (the return of the crescent), which poses as an active tube station in films and television shows. Marking the east end of the street and in the middle of the crescent return are Grade I heritage listed churches designed by Wren and Gibbs. Immediately north-east of St Clement Danes (St Clements), on Strand, is the Royal Courts of Justice, a complex of courtrooms used by the senior courts of England and Wales, including the High Court and the Court of Appeal of England and Wales.

==Landmarks==
Aldwych, the street, is a crescent, connected to the Strand at both ends, and forms part of the A4 route. Streets adjoining are Drury Lane, Kingsway, India Place and Melbourne Place. Notable buildings along its length include:

Theatres:
* Aldwych Theatre, opened in 1905
* Novello Theatre, opened in 1905

High Commissions:
* India House, the High Commission of India in London
* Australia House, the High Commission of Australia in London

Hotels and Restaurants:
* The Waldorf Hilton, London, a hotel opened in 1908
* The ME Hotel, designed by Richard Rogers
* One Aldwych

Universities:
* Bush House, King House, Melbourne House and Strand House - making up the Aldwych Quarter - formerly the office headquarters of the BBC World Service from 1941 to 2012 and now part of the Strand Campus of King&#x27;s College London
* Connaught House, Columbia House, Aldwych House, and Clement House, buildings of the London School of Economics

Former buildings include:
* Gaiety Theatre, opened in 1864 and closed in 1939
* Television House (now known as 61 Aldwych), former headquarters of several defunct ITV franchise contractors and ITN

Facing one end of the street on the Strand is closed-in-1994 Aldwych station, originally named Strand station. It has been used when closed for scenes of films and television dramas.

==History==

In the seventh century, the area was an Anglo-Saxon major settlement Lundenwic (the last syllable pronounced as today) (&#x27;London port&#x27;) centred one mile to the west of &quot;Londinium&quot; (known to the Saxons as &quot;Lundenburh&quot; &#x27;London fort&#x27;). &quot;Lundenwic&quot; later became the old wich (old port, that is Aldwych). It is not known if it had a church, and the town either took advantage of the scouring action of the Fleet or used the mouth itself as a harbour for trading ships and fishing boats. After Alfred the Great re-built the London fortifications in the late 9th century, Londinium became known as &quot;Lundenburh&quot; or simply Lunden, and &quot;Lundenwic&quot; so became ealdwic or aldwich. (The word &quot;&quot; evolved from ald, the Old English being eald and the German cognate being alt.) The name was recorded as &quot;Aldewich&quot; in 1211.

St Clement Danes is one of the four ancient Westminster parishes and was first recorded in the 1190s; it once covered the whole of Aldwych and all adjoining areas. Its church, which features in the first line of the nursery rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;, was rebuilt by Wren. The civil parish was abolished in 1922. It is open to - and it is known by residents and businesses to - use the term St Clement Danes interchangeably with Aldwych, which also covered in its final, smallest form the Adelphi and much of the Strand.
The urban centre of &quot;Lundenwic&quot; was unearthed in the 1980s after extensive excavations, and were reinterpreted as being urban in character. These conclusions were reached independently by two archaeologists (Vince and Biddle). Recent excavations in Covent Garden adjoining have uncovered an extensive Anglo-Saxon settlement, covering about , stretching from the present-day National Gallery site in the west, to Aldwych in the east. As the presumed locus of the city, &quot;Lundenburh&quot;, was moved back within the old Roman walls, the older settlement of &quot;Lundenwic&quot; gained the name of &quot;ealdwic&quot;, &#x27;old port&#x27;, &quot;eald&quot; and the softer form of &quot;wic&quot; transposed to &quot;ald&quot; and &quot;wich&quot; in Middle English orthography.

The street was created in the early 20th century in a project that saw a new street layout destroying Wych Street which was full of overhangs and projections, and the construction of Australia House (built 1913–18) and Bush House (completed 1925). A statue of the 19th-century prime minister William Ewart Gladstone was installed in 1905 near St Clement Danes church, at the eastern end of Aldwych.

In 1906, Aldwych tramway station was opened underneath Kingsway; it closed in 1952. In 1907, Aldwych station was opened on the Strand opposite Aldwych; it closed in 1994.

On 18 February 1996, a bomb was detonated prematurely on a number 171 bus travelling along Aldwych, killing its carrier, Provisional Irish Republican Army member Edward O&#x27;Brien and injuring several passengers.

In 2021, the Strand was pedestrianised between Melbourne Place and Lancaster Place, and Aldwych was converted into a two-way street.

<doc id="381774" wikidata="Q143746" url="?curid=381774" title="Compressed air">
<text>Compressed air is air kept under a pressure that is greater than atmospheric pressure. Compressed air in vehicle tires and shock absorbers are commonly used for improved traction and reduced vibration. Compressed air is an important medium for the transfer of energy in industrial processes and is used for power tools such as air hammers, drills, wrenches, and others, as well as to atomize paint, to operate air cylinders for automation, and can also be used to propel vehicles. Brakes applied by compressed air made large railway trains safer and more efficient to operate. Compressed air brakes are also found on large highway vehicles.

Compressed air is used as a breathing gas by underwater divers. The diver may carry it in a high-pressure diving cylinder, or supplied from the surface at lower pressure through an air line or diver&#x27;s umbilical. Similar arrangements are used in breathing apparatus used by firefighters, mine rescue workers and industrial workers in hazardous atmospheres.

In Europe, 10 percent of all industrial electricity consumption is to produce compressed air—amounting to 80 terawatt hours consumption per year.

Industrial use of piped compressed air for power transmission was developed in the mid-19th century; unlike steam, compressed air could be piped for long distances without losing pressure due to condensation. An early major application of compressed air was in the drilling of the Mont Cenis Tunnel in Italy and France in 1861, where a 600 kPa (87 psi) compressed air plant provided power to pneumatic drills, increasing productivity greatly over previous manual drilling methods. Compressed-air drills were applied at mines in the United States in the 1870s. George Westinghouse invented air brakes for trains starting in 1869; these brakes considerably improved the safety of rail operations. In the 19th century, Paris had a system of pipes installed for municipal distribution of compressed air to power machines and to operate generators for lighting. Early air compressors were steam-driven, but in certain locations a trompe could directly obtain compressed air from the force of falling water.

==Breathing==
Air for breathing may be stored at high pressure and gradually released when needed, as in scuba diving and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) or used by firefighters and industrial workers, or produced continuously to meet requirements, as in surface-supplied diving. Air for breathing must be free of oil and other contaminants; carbon monoxide, for example, in trace volumetric fractions that might not be dangerous at normal atmospheric pressure may have deadly effects when breathing pressurized air due to proportionally higher partial pressure. Air compressors, filters, and supply systems intended for breathing air are not generally also used for pneumatic tools or other purposes, as air quality requirements differ.

Workers constructing the foundations of bridges or other structures may be working in a pressurized enclosure called a caisson, where water is prevented from entering the open bottom of the enclosure by filling it with air under pressure. It was known as early as the 17th century that workers in diving bells experienced shortness of breath and risked asphyxia, relieved by the release of fresh air into the bell. Such workers also experienced pain and other symptoms when returning to the surface, as the pressure was relieved. Denis Papin suggested in 1691 that the working time in a diving bell could be extended if fresh air from the surface was continually forced under pressure into the bell. By the 19th century, caissons were regularly used in civil construction, but workers experienced serious, sometimes fatal, symptoms on returning to the surface, a syndrome called caisson disease or decompression sickness. Many workers were killed by the disease on projects such as the Brooklyn Bridge and the Eads Bridge and it was not until the 1890s that it was understood that workers had to decompress slowly, to prevent the formation of dangerous bubbles in tissues.

Air under moderately high pressure, such as is used when diving below about , has an increasing narcotic effect on the nervous system. Nitrogen narcosis is a hazard when diving. For diving much beyond , it is less safe to use air alone and special breathing mixes containing helium are often used.

In land-based applications, SCBAs, UEBSS (USA), and EBBS (EU) provide breathable air for emergency responders, industrial workers, and military personnel in hazardous environments. These devices use compressed air cylinders to supply clean air to the wearer, ensuring safety in oxygen-deficient or contaminated atmospheres. To enhance operational safety and efficiency, Kee Connections Buddy Breather coupling allows users to share air in emergency situations. This coupling system enables firefighters or other SCBA users to connect their breathing apparatuses, providing life-saving air support when needed. Such innovations help improve survivability and teamwork in high-risk conditions.

==Uses==

In industry, compressed air is so widely used that it is often regarded as the fourth utility, after electricity, natural gas and water. However, compressed air is more expensive than the other three utilities when evaluated on a per unit energy delivered basis.

Compressed air is used for many purposes, including:
* Pneumatics, the use of pressurized gases to do work
** Pneumatic post, using capsules to move paper and small goods through tubes.
** Air tools
** HVAC control systems
** spray painting 
* Vehicle propulsion (&quot;see&quot; compressed-air vehicle)
* Energy storage (&quot;see&quot; compressed-air energy storage)
* Recreation – Amusement Parks, Golf Courses (Sprinkler Systems), Hotel elevators, Ski Resorts (Snow making)
* Air brakes, including:
** railway braking systems
** road vehicle braking systems
* Underwater diving, for breathing, to inflate buoyancy compensator devices and lifting bags, and for airlift dredging 
* Refrigeration using a vortex tube
* Air-start systems in engines
* Ammunition propulsion in:
** Air guns
** Airsoft equipment
** Paintball equipment
* Cleaning dust and small debris in tiny spaces
* Abrasive blasting for removing corrosion products and coatings
* Injection molding
* Airbrushing used by model railroaders and other hobbyists to paint and weather cars, boats, planes and trains
* Food and beverage capping and fermentation
* Compressed air from Lysefjorden/Preikestolen (Norway) is being sold in cans, mostly to China.

=== Emergency Services &amp; Firefighting ===

* Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) – Used by firefighters, rescue workers, and hazmat teams for breathing in hazardous environments.
* Fire Suppression Systems – Some fire suppression systems, such as dry chemical and CO₂ systems, use compressed air to discharge fire-extinguishing agents.
* Rescue Tools (Pneumatic Jaws of Life) – Hydraulic or pneumatic-powered rescue tools used to cut through vehicles and debris during emergency extrications.
* Inflatable Rescue Devices – Air-powered inflatable boats, flotation devices, and emergency life rafts.

=== Medical Uses ===

* Ventilators &amp; Respirators – Compressed air is used in hospitals and ambulances to power ventilators and oxygen delivery systems.
* Dental Equipment – Dentists use compressed air to power drills and cleaning tools
* Hyperbaric Chambers – Used for treating decompression sickness, wound healing, and other medical conditions requiring high-pressure oxygen therapy.
* Portable Oxygen Systems – Some emergency and home healthcare oxygen systems use compressed air for efficient delivery.

== Energy Costs of a Compressed Air System ==
Regarding operating costs, it is important to consider that compressed air represents a significant portion of total energy costs. Roughly, every 1 kW of energy produced requires 8 kW of electrical energy. 
Additionally, considering the lifecycle of a compressed air system (about 10-15 years), the total costs can be broken down as follows:

* 70-75%: Energy costs
* 15-20%: Compressor, accessories, piping, and installation costs
* 10%: Maintenance costs

==Design of systems==
Compressor rooms must be designed with ventilation systems to remove waste heat produced by the compressors.

===Water and oil vapor removal===
When air at atmospheric pressure is compressed, it contains much more water vapor than the high-pressure air can hold. Relative humidity is governed by the properties of water and is not affected by air pressure. After compressed air cools, then the vaporized water turns to liquefied water.

Cooling the air as it leaves the compressor will take most of the moisture out before it gets into the piping. Aftercooler, storage tanks, etc. can help the compressed air cool to 104 °F; two-thirds of the water then turns to liquid.

Management of the excessive moisture is a requirement of a compressed air distribution system. System designers must ensure that piping maintains a slope, to prevent accumulation of moisture in low parts of the piping system. Drain valves may be installed at multiple points of a large system to allow trapped water to be blown out. Taps from piping headers may be arranged at the tops of pipes, so that moisture is not carried over into piping branches feeding equipment. Piping sizes are selected to avoid excessive energy loss in the piping system due to excess velocity in straight pipes at times of peak demand, or due to turbulence at pipe fittings.

<text>The bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) is a small New World blackbird and the only member of the genus Dolichonyx. An old name for this species is the &quot;rice bird&quot;, from its tendency to feed on cultivated grains during winter and migration. The bobolink breeds in the summer in the United States and Canada, with most of the summer range in the northern U.S. Bobolinks winter in southern South America, primarily Paraguay, Argentina, and Bolivia. Bobolink populations are rapidly declining due to numerous factors, such as agricultural intensification and habitat loss; they are considered threatened in Canada, and are at risk throughout their range.

==Taxonomy==
The bobolink was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the finches in the genus &quot;Fringilla&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Fringilla oryzivora&quot;. Linnaeus mainly based his account on &quot;The Rice-Bird&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1729 by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as &quot;Cuba ... in Carolinam&quot; but this was restricted to the state of South Carolina by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1931. The bobolink is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Dolichonyx&quot; that was introduced in 1827 by the English zoologist William Swainson. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek δολιχος/&quot;dolikhos&quot; meaning &quot;long&quot; with ονυξ/&quot;onux&quot;, ονυχος/&quot;onukhos&quot; meaning &quot;claw&quot; or &quot;nail&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;oryzivorus&quot; combines the Latin &quot;oryza&quot; meaning &quot;rice&quot; with &quot;-vorus&quot; meaning &quot;eating&quot;. The English name &quot;bobolink&quot; is from Bob o&#x27; Lincoln, describing the call. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

Adults are long with short finch-like bills and weigh about . Adult males are mostly black with creamy napes and white scapulars, lower backs, and rumps. Adult females are mostly light brown with black streaks on the back and flanks, and dark stripes on the head; their wings and tails are darker.

==Distribution and movements==
The bobolink breeds in the summer in North America across much of southern Canada and the northern United States; from 1966 to 2015 the species experienced a greater than 1.5% annual population decrease throughout most of its breeding range, extending from the Midwestern United States to the Canadian Maritimes. The bobolink migrates long distances, wintering in southern South America. One bird was tracked migrating over the course of the year, often flying long distances up to in a single day, then stopping to recuperate for days or weeks.

Bobolinks often migrate in flocks, feeding on cultivated grains and rice, which leads to them being considered a pest by farmers in some areas. Although bobolinks migrate long distances, they have rarely been sighted in Europe — like many vagrants from the Americas, the majority of records are from the British Isles.

The species has been known in the southern United States as the &quot;reedbird,&quot; or the &quot;ricebird&quot; from their consumption of large amounts of the grain from rice fields in South Carolina and the Gulf States during their southward migration in the fall. One of the species&#x27; main migration routes is through Jamaica, where they are called &quot;butter-birds&quot; and at least historically were collected as food, having fattened up on the aforementioned rice.

Bobolinks are the only species of land bird known to annually migrate through the Galápagos Islands, which are over 2,000 km from their primary migration route. A bobolink was collected in the Galápagos Islands by Charles Darwin in 1835. Bobolinks have been hypothesized to act as vectors for avian malaria-causing parasites arriving in the Islands. Additionally, bobolinks in the Galápagos have been found with seeds from &quot;Drymaria cordata&quot;, a plant native to the Galápagos but highly invasive elsewhere, entangled in their feathers, potentially spreading them to the mainland.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===
Their breeding habitats are open grassy fields, especially hay fields, across North America. In high-quality habitats, males are often polygynous. Females lay five to six eggs in a cup-shaped nest, which is always situated on the ground and is usually well-hidden in dense vegetation. Both parents feed the young.

===Feeding===
Bobolinks forage on or near the ground and mainly eat seeds and insects. They are nicknamed the &quot;&quot; because of their predation on large numbers of armyworms, including the true armyworm (&quot;Mythimna unipuncta&quot;) and the fall armyworm (&quot;Spodoptera frugiperda&quot;), acting as a natural pest control. In Florida, bobolinks feed most often on the Fall armyworm rather than the True armyworm, as the former is more common in the region.

===Calls===
Males sing bright, bubbly songs in flight.

==Status and conservation==
During the 1800s the bobolink, like many birds, was slaughtered in large numbers for the meat trade.

The numbers of these birds are declining due to loss of habitat. Bobolinks are a species at risk in Nova Scotia, and throughout Canada. In Vermont, a 75% decline was noted between 1966 and 2007. Originally, they were found in tallgrass prairie and other open areas with dense grass. Although hay fields are suitable nesting habitats, fields which are harvested early, or at multiple times, in a season may not allow sufficient time for young birds to fledge. Delaying hay harvests by just 1.5 weeks can improve bobolink survival by 20%. This species increased in numbers when horses were the primary mode of transportation, requiring larger supplies of hay.

A 2021 study found that the reintroduction of American bison across the United States was detrimental to bobolink populations, with adult populations dropping as much as 62% and juvenile populations as much as 84%. This is presumed to be due to many new bison herds being managed more as livestock than wildlife, often kept in fenced pastures and protected from predation, which encourages overgrazing, trampling, and rapid multiplying. The study also found that lighter grazing by bison did not have the same harmful effects, demonstrating that the two species could likely coexist under the right circumstances.

==Media references==
Emily Dickinson penned many poems about or mentioning the bird. Edgar Allan Poe mentions the bird in &quot;Landor&#x27;s Cottage&quot;. William Cullen Bryant wrote about the bob-o&#x27;-link in his poem &quot;Robert of Lincoln.&quot;

The bobolink is mentioned in the song &quot;Evelina&quot; by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg, from the musical &quot;Bloomer Girl&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;Evelina, won&#x27;t ya ever take a shine to that moon?
Evelina, ain&#x27;t ya bothered by the Bobolink&#x27;s tune?&lt;/poem&gt;

The bird is also one of the many important ornithological references in the poem &quot;Pale Fire&quot; by the fictional poet John Shade, part of Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s novel of the same name.

Sophie Jewett ends her poem &quot;An Exile&#x27;s Garden&quot; (1910) with a reference to a bobolink.

The bobolink is also mentioned in the film &quot;The Mouse on the Moon&quot; in connection with the fictional European microstate of Grand Fenwick, where oddly the bird is apparently common.

The bobolink is also mentioned in the musical &quot;Camelot&quot;. Words by Alan Jay Lerner.

The bobolink is mentioned in the song, &quot;The Wind,&quot; by Billy Bob Thornton, written by Warren Zevon.

<doc id="381779" wikidata="Q6139782" url="?curid=381779" title="James Miller (parachutist)">
<text>James Jarrett Miller (October 28, 1963 – c. 22 September 2002), also known as the Fan Man, was an American parachutist and paraglider pilot known for his appearances at various sporting events. His most infamous appearance was the November 6, 1993, boxing match between Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe at Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, Nevada. Fan Man made headlines in the United States when he used his powered paraglider to fly into the arena, eventually crashing into the side of the ring. Miller went missing in 2002 and was found having hanged himself in 2003, a year after being diagnosed with coronary artery disease, which resulted in his being unable to do any flying, paragliding or hiking, and resulted in him closing his computer business due to mounting debts from medical bills.

==Background==
Miller was born in Havre de Grace, Maryland. He had three younger brothers and two younger sisters. In 1975, the Miller family moved to a country home near the Canada–United States border. The following year, the family relocated to Tok, Alaska. Miller later earned an associate degree in computer programming from the University of Alaska at Juneau. In the late 1980s, he moved to Las Vegas where he was introduced to paragliders.

Miller had been interested in flying since childhood and quickly became a paragliding enthusiast. 
He started with a jetpack tied to his back, and moved up to two-cycle aircraft engines which powered him through the skies above the desert. He began setting power-gliding records for altitude and distance, with a reputation for reckless daring.

==The Fan Man fight==
Miller&#x27;s first and most famous stunt happened on November 6, 1993, during the heavyweight title fight between Riddick Bowe and Evander Holyfield. Miller descended into the side of the ring area during the second minute of the seventh round of the fight, after circling Caesars Palace for ten minutes. The lines of his paraglider became tangled in the overhead lights, after which he landed on the top rope of the ring with his parachute still tangled in the lights. He tried to hang on with one foot and one hand on that top rope for a few seconds until he either fell or was dragged down into the crowd by spectators, his parachute ripping away from the lights above.

Fans and the fighters&#x27; security detail swarmed around him immediately and began attacking him. He was knocked unconscious during the attack. One security officer reportedly struck Miller twenty times. He was rushed to a nearby hospital as spectators cut his paraglider into pieces for souvenirs. After his release from the hospital, Miller was taken to the Clark County Detention Center, where he was charged with dangerous flying and released on $200 bail. In an exclusive interview with British journalists after the bout, Miller categorized his ring crash as accidental and not intentional, claiming it was caused by mechanical problems. Miller later joked, &quot;It was a heavyweight fight and I was the only guy who got knocked out.&quot;

The media immediately dubbed Miller &quot;Fan Man,&quot; for the paramotor (lightweight engine and propeller) attached to his harness.

==Other stunts==
On January 9, 1994, Miller circled approximately 1,000 feet over the rim of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on his paraglider during the Denver Broncos–Los Angeles Raiders NFL playoff game. He landed in a park north of the Coliseum where he was arrested for interfering with a sporting event. Later that same month, he &quot;buzzed&quot;, (flew low over), a Bolton Wanderers–Arsenal 4th round FA Cup football match at Burnden Park in Bolton, England. After serving a seven-day prison sentence, Miller was deported by British authorities.

On February 5 he was witnessed by British police paragliding along The Mall before landing atop Buckingham Palace. He then removed his trousers revealing that he was painted green from the waist down. He was arrested without incident, fined £200 and was again deported. He was banned from reentering the UK for life.

When asked by reporters what his motives were for staging these stunts, Miller never gave clear answers. He claimed that he intentionally landed in the ring to break up the Bowe vs. Holyfield match, claiming he was opposed to violence. Miller&#x27;s younger brother later said Miller staged the stunts because, &quot;He was basically bucking society. He was mocking our rules, making up his own as he went along, kind of just making a mockery of our society and the way it works and what our expectations are.&quot;

==Later years and death ==
After returning to the United States, Miller received death threats for interrupting sporting events. In 1996, he relocated to Valdez, Alaska where he lived in a dry cabin. He continued to fly ultralight aircraft and paragliders in the Alaskan wilderness and also gave lessons. Miller briefly worked for a computer company before opening his own computer business. In 2001, he was diagnosed with coronary artery disease and underwent double bypass surgery. There were complications and Miller developed health issues. He underwent two additional surgeries to correct issues caused by the first surgery, but continued to experience constant chest pains and ill health. Miller was unable to continue flying, paragliding and hiking because of his declining health. Due to mounting debts from medical bills, Miller was forced to close his computer business. He moved to Anchorage in 2002, where he worked for a utility company.

On September 22, 2002, Miller was reported missing after he disappeared earlier that morning while driving to the wilderness. His car was found near the Resurrection Pass Trail in Chugach National Forest on the Kenai Peninsula. A search was launched but was suspended on October 13. On March 9, 2003, a group of hunters bushwhacking through the woods on the peninsula found Miller&#x27;s decomposing body. An autopsy revealed that Miller had hanged himself from a tree. Police said they believed Miller had chosen the remote Resurrection Pass Trail and had veered deep off-trail in hopes that his body would not have been discovered for years, if ever. At the time of his death, Miller&#x27;s girlfriend was pregnant with the couple&#x27;s first child. She gave birth to their son shortly before Miller&#x27;s body was discovered in March 2003.

Although Miller&#x27;s disappearance and death were reported in the local press shortly after his body was found, his suicide did not become widely known outside Alaska until the latter part of 2003 when ESPN went searching for him to film a &quot;SportsCenter&quot; feature to be shown during the tenth anniversary of his stunt.

<doc id="381782" wikidata="Q197520" url="?curid=381782" title="NumPy">
<text>NumPy (pronounced ) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. The predecessor of NumPy, Numeric, was originally created by Jim Hugunin with contributions from several other developers. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy by incorporating features of the competing Numarray into Numeric, with extensive modifications. NumPy is open-source software and has many contributors. NumPy is fiscally sponsored by NumFOCUS.

== History ==
===matrix-sig===
The Python programming language was not originally designed for numerical computing, but attracted the attention of the scientific and engineering community early on. In 1995 the special interest group (SIG) &quot;matrix-sig&quot; was founded with the aim of defining an array computing package; among its members was Python designer and maintainer Guido van Rossum, who extended Python&#x27;s syntax (in particular the indexing syntax) to make array computing easier.

===Numeric===
An implementation of a matrix package was completed by Jim Fulton, then generalized by Jim Hugunin and called &quot;Numeric&quot; (also variously known as the &quot;Numerical Python extensions&quot; or &quot;NumPy&quot;), with influences from the APL family of languages, Basis, MATLAB, FORTRAN, S and S+, and others.
Hugunin, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), joined the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in 1997 to work on JPython, leaving Paul Dubois of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to take over as maintainer. Other early contributors include David Ascher, Konrad Hinsen and Travis Oliphant.

===Numarray===
A new package called &quot;Numarray&quot; was written as a more flexible replacement for Numeric. Like Numeric, it too is now deprecated. Numarray had faster operations for large arrays, but was slower than Numeric on small ones, so for a time both packages were used in parallel for different use cases. The last version of Numeric (v24.2) was released on 11 November 2005, while the last version of numarray (v1.5.2) was released on 24 August 2006.

There was a desire to get Numeric into the Python standard library, but Guido van Rossum decided that the code was not maintainable in its state then.

===NumPy===
In early 2005, NumPy developer Travis Oliphant wanted to unify the community around a single array package and ported Numarray&#x27;s features to Numeric, releasing the result as NumPy 1.0 in 2006. This new project was part of SciPy. To avoid installing the large SciPy package just to get an array object, this new package was separated and called NumPy. Support for Python 3 was added in 2011 with NumPy version 1.5.0.

In 2011, PyPy started development on an implementation of the NumPy API for PyPy. As of 2023, it is not yet fully compatible with NumPy.

== Features ==
NumPy targets the CPython reference implementation of Python, which is a non-optimizing bytecode interpreter. Mathematical algorithms written for this version of Python often run much slower than compiled equivalents due to the absence of compiler optimization. NumPy addresses the slowness problem partly by providing multidimensional arrays and functions and operators that operate efficiently on arrays; using these requires rewriting some code, mostly inner loops, using NumPy.

Using NumPy in Python gives functionality comparable to MATLAB since they are both interpreted, and they both allow the user to write fast programs as long as most operations work on arrays or matrices instead of scalars. In comparison, MATLAB boasts a large number of additional toolboxes, notably Simulink, whereas NumPy is intrinsically integrated with Python, a more modern and complete programming language. Moreover, complementary Python packages are available; SciPy is a library that adds more MATLAB-like functionality and Matplotlib is a plotting package that provides MATLAB-like plotting functionality. Although matlab can perform sparse matrix operations, numpy alone cannot perform such operations and requires the use of the scipy.sparse library. Internally, both MATLAB and NumPy rely on BLAS and LAPACK for efficient linear algebra computations.

Python bindings of the widely used computer vision library OpenCV utilize NumPy arrays to store and operate on data.
Since images with multiple channels are simply represented as three-dimensional arrays, indexing, slicing or masking with other arrays are very efficient ways to access specific pixels of an image.
The NumPy array as universal data structure in OpenCV for images, extracted feature points, filter kernels and many more vastly simplifies the programming workflow and debugging.

Importantly, many NumPy operations release the global interpreter lock, which allows for multithreaded processing.

NumPy also provides a C API, which allows Python code to interoperate with external libraries written in low-level languages. 

=== The ndarray data structure ===
The core functionality of NumPy is its &quot;ndarray&quot;, for &quot;n&quot;-dimensional array, data structure. These arrays are strided views on memory. In contrast to Python&#x27;s built-in list data structure, these arrays are homogeneously typed: all elements of a single array must be of the same type.

Such arrays can also be views into memory buffers allocated by C/C++, Python, and Fortran extensions to the CPython interpreter without the need to copy data around, giving a degree of compatibility with existing numerical libraries. This functionality is exploited by the SciPy package, which wraps a number of such libraries (notably BLAS and LAPACK). NumPy has built-in support for memory-mapped ndarrays.

===Limitations===
Inserting or appending entries to an array is not as trivially possible as it is with Python&#x27;s lists.
The routine to extend arrays actually creates new arrays of the desired shape and padding values, copies the given array into the new one and returns it.
NumPy&#x27;s operation does not actually link the two arrays but returns a new one, filled with the entries from both given arrays in sequence.
Reshaping the dimensionality of an array with is only possible as long as the number of elements in the array does not change.
These circumstances originate from the fact that NumPy&#x27;s arrays must be views on contiguous memory buffers.

Algorithms that are not expressible as a vectorized operation will typically run slowly because they must be implemented in &quot;pure Python&quot;, while vectorization may increase memory complexity of some operations from constant to linear, because temporary arrays must be created that are as large as the inputs. Runtime compilation of numerical code has been implemented by several groups to avoid these problems; open source solutions that interoperate with NumPy include numexpr and Numba. Cython and Pythran are static-compiling alternatives to these.

Many modern large-scale scientific computing applications have requirements that exceed the capabilities of the NumPy arrays.
For example, NumPy arrays are usually loaded into a computer&#x27;s memory, which might have insufficient capacity for the analysis of large datasets.
Further, NumPy operations are executed on a single CPU.
However, many linear algebra operations can be accelerated by executing them on clusters of CPUs or of specialized hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, which many deep learning applications rely on.
As a result, several alternative array implementations have arisen in the scientific python ecosystem over the recent years, such as Dask for distributed arrays and TensorFlow or JAX for computations on GPUs.
Because of its popularity, these often implement a subset of NumPy&#x27;s API or mimic it, so that users can change their array implementation with minimal changes to their code required. A library named CuPy, accelerated by Nvidia&#x27;s CUDA framework, has also shown potential for faster computing, being a &#x27;drop-in replacement&#x27; of NumPy.

<doc id="381784" wikidata="Q852423" url="?curid=381784" title="Laryngeal cancer">
<text>Laryngeal cancer is a kind of cancer that can develop in any part of the larynx (voice box). It is typically a squamous-cell carcinoma, reflecting its origin from the epithelium of the larynx.

The prognosis is affected by the location of the tumour. For the purposes of staging, the larynx is divided into three anatomical regions: the glottis (true vocal cords, anterior and posterior commissures); the supraglottis (epiglottis, arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds, and false cords); and the subglottis. Most laryngeal cancers originate in the glottis, with supraglottic and subglottic tumours being less frequent.

Laryngeal cancer may spread by: direct extension to adjacent structures, metastasis to regional cervical lymph nodes, or via the blood stream. The most common site of distant metastases is the lung. Laryngeal cancer occurred in 177,000 people in 2018, and resulted in 94,800 deaths (an increase from 76,000 deaths in 1990). Five-year survival rates in the United States are 60.3%.
==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of laryngeal cancer depend on the size and location of the tumour. Symptoms may include the following:
* Hoarseness or other voice changes
* A lump in the neck
* A sore throat or feeling that something is stuck in the throat
* Persistent cough
* Stridor - a high-pitched wheezing sound indicative of a narrowed or obstructed airway
* Bad breath
* Earache (due to referred pain)
* Difficulty swallowing

Adverse effects of treatment can include changes in appearance, difficulty eating, dry mouth, or loss of voice that may require learning alternate methods of speaking.

==Risk factors==
The most important risk factor for laryngeal cancer is tobacco smoking. Death from laryngeal cancer is 20 times more likely for the heaviest smokers than for their non-smoking peers. Regular and heavy consumption of alcohol, particularly alcoholic spirits, is also a significant risk factor. Using alcohol and tobacco together is an especially high risk factor and causes 89% of laryngeal cancer cases.

Occupational exposure to environmental factors such as wood dust, paint fumes, and certain chemicals used in the metalworking, petroleum, plastics, and textile industries is also believed to be a risk factor for laryngeal cancers. Infections by some forms of HPV carry some risk of laryngeal carcinoma.

People with a history of head and neck cancer are known to be at higher risk (about 25%) of developing a second, separate cancer of the head, neck, or lung. This is likely due to chronic exposure to the carcinogenic effects of alcohol and tobacco. In this situation, a field change effect may occur, where the epithelial tissues start to become diffusely dysplastic with a reduced threshold for malignant change. This risk may be reduced by quitting alcohol and tobacco.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is made by the doctor on the basis of a medical history, physical examination, and special investigations which may include a chest x-ray, CT or MRI scans, and tissue biopsy. The examination of the larynx requires some expertise, which may require specialist referral.

The physical exam includes a systematic examination of the whole patient to assess general health and to look for signs of associated conditions and metastatic disease. The neck and supraclavicular fossa are palpated to feel for cervical adenopathy, other masses, and laryngeal crepitus. The oral cavity and oropharynx are examined under direct vision. The larynx may be examined by indirect laryngoscopy using a small angled mirror with a long handle (akin to a dentist&#x27;s mirror) and a strong light. Indirect laryngoscopy can be highly effective, but requires skill and practice for consistent results. For this reason, many specialist clinics now use fibre-optic nasal endoscopy where a thin and flexible endoscope, inserted through the nostril, is used to clearly visualise the entire pharynx and larynx. Nasal endoscopy is a quick and easy procedure performed in clinic. Local anaesthetic spray may be used.

If there is a suspicion of cancer, biopsy is performed, usually under general anaesthetic. This provides histological proof of cancer type and grade. If the lesion appears to be small and well localised, the surgeon may undertake excision biopsy, where an attempt is made to completely remove the tumour at the time of first biopsy. In this situation, the pathologist will not only be able to confirm the diagnosis, but can also comment on the completeness of excision, i.e., whether the tumour has been completely removed. A full endoscopic examination of the larynx, trachea, and esophagus is often performed at the time of biopsy.

For small glottic tumours further imaging may be unnecessary. In most cases, tumour staging is completed by scanning the head and neck region to assess the local extent of the tumour and any pathologically enlarged cervical lymph nodes.

The final management plan will depend on the site, stage (tumour size, nodal spread, distant metastasis), and histological type. The overall health and wishes of the patient must also be taken into account. A prognostic multigene classifier has been shown to be potentially useful for the distinction of laryngeal cancer of low or high risk of recurrence and might influence the treatment choice in future.

==Staging==
Laryngeal tumours are classified according to the guidelines set by academic organisations such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) . Overall classification, also known as &quot;staging&quot;, can help predict treatment options for patients. Staging consists of three separate evaluations. The first is of the tumour/cancer itself (&quot;T&quot;). The second is the extent to which adjacent lymph nodes are involved in the tumour/cancer&#x27;s spread (&quot;N&quot;). The third is the presence or absence of any distant metastases (&quot;M). The specific “staging” criteria for laryngeal cancer, as utilised in the NCCN’s 2019 Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers, are:

=== T ===
TX: Unable to assess

Tis: &quot;Carcinoma in situ&quot;

==== Supraglottis ====
T1: Tumour present in only one subsite of the supraglottis. Vocal cords have normal mobility.

=== M ===
M0: No evidence of distant metastasis

M1: Evidence of distant metastasis

== Treatment ==

Specific treatment depends on the location, type, and stage of the tumour. Treatment may involve surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, alone or in combination.

Surgical Treatment

Surgical treatment may involve partial or full removal of the tumour. Neighbouring tissues and structures may or may not be removed, depending on their involvement in the tumour’s structure and spread. Full removal of the larynx may be necessary in some cases.

Adjunct Treatment

Adjunct treatment, most commonly the administration of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, may be necessary. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be necessary singly, in combination with each other, or in combination with surgery. Adjunct treatment may be necessary prior to surgical treatment, alongside surgical treatment, or after surgical treatment. Clinical decision-making can be difficult in circumstances where the patient is unable to access necessary adjunct treatment.

Multi-Disciplinary Treatment

Often, successful treatment of and recovery from laryngeal cancer will involve expertise outside of the realms of surgery or oncology. Physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, oral/maxillofacial surgeons, dentists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, and endocrinologists may all become involved in the care of patients with laryngeal cancer.

==Epidemiology==
Incidence is five in 100,000 (12,500 new cases per year) in the US. The American Cancer Society estimated that 9,510 men and women (7,700 men and 1,810 women) would be diagnosed with and 3,740 men and women would die of laryngeal cancer in 2006.

According to the GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 177,422 new cases of laryngeal cancer worldwide in 2018 (1.0% of the global total.) Among worldwide cancer deaths, 94,771 (1.0%) were due to laryngeal cancer.
In 2019, it is estimated that there will be 12,410 new laryngeal cancer cases in the United States, (3.0 per 100,000). The number of new cases decreases every year at a rate of 2.4%, and this is believed to be related to decreased cigarette smoking in the general population.

Laryngeal cancer is listed as a &quot;rare disease&quot; by the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This means that laryngeal cancer affects fewer than 200,000 people in the US.

<text>This article lists the [[etymologies]] of the [[name]]s of the [[provinces and territories of Canada]].

==Provinces and territories==

==Historical regions==
*Acadia (): origin disputed:
*# Credited to Florentine navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano, who first named a region around Chesapeake Bay &quot;Archadia&quot; (Arcadia) in 1524 because of &quot;the beauty of its trees&quot;, according to his diary. Cartographers began using the name &quot;Arcadia&quot; to refer to areas progressively farther north until it referred to the French holdings in maritime Canada (particularly Nova Scotia). The &quot;-r-&quot; also began to disappear from the name on early maps, resulting in the current &quot;Acadia&quot;.
*# Possibly derived from the Míkmaq word &quot;&quot;, pronounced roughly &quot;agadik&quot;, meaning &quot;place&quot;, which French-speakers spelled as &quot;-cadie&quot; in place names such as Shubenacadie and Tracadie, possibly coincidentally.
*District of Keewatin: Algonquian roots—either () in Cree or () in Ojibwe—both of which mean &#x27;north wind&#x27; in their respective languages.
*Nunatsiavut: Inuktitut, meaning &quot;our beautiful land&quot;.

<doc id="381794" wikidata="Q352045" url="?curid=381794" title="Adam's apple">
<text>The Adam&#x27;s apple is the protrusion in the neck formed by the angle of the thyroid cartilage surrounding the larynx, typically visible in men, less frequently in women. The prominence of the Adam&#x27;s apple increases in some men as a secondary male sex characteristic during puberty.

==Structure==

The topographic structure which is externally visible and colloquially called the &quot;Adam&#x27;s apple&quot; is caused by an anatomical structure of the thyroid cartilage called the laryngeal prominence or laryngeal protuberance protruding and forming a &quot;bump&quot; under the skin at the front of the throat. All human beings with a normal anatomy have a laryngeal protuberance of the thyroid cartilage. This prominence is typically larger and more externally noticeable in adult males. There are two reasons for this phenomenon. Firstly, the structural size of the thyroid cartilage in males tends to increase during puberty, and the laryngeal protuberance becomes more anteriorly focused. Secondly, the larynx, which the thyroid cartilage partially envelops, increases in size in male subjects during adolescence, moving the thyroid cartilage and its laryngeal protuberance towards the front of the neck. The adolescent development of both the larynx and the thyroid cartilage in males occurs as a result of hormonal changes, especially the normal increase in testosterone production in adolescent males. In females, the laryngeal protuberance sits on the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, and the larynx tends to be smaller in size, and so the &quot;bump&quot; caused by protrusion of the laryngeal protuberance is much less visible or not discernible. Even so, many women display an externally visible protrusion of the thyroid cartilage, an &quot;Adam&#x27;s apple&quot;, to varying degrees which are usually minor, and this should not normally be viewed as a medical disorder.

==Function==
The Adam&#x27;s apple, in relation with the thyroid cartilage which forms it, helps protect the walls and the frontal part of the larynx, including the vocal cords (which are located directly behind it).

Another function of the Adam&#x27;s apple is related to the deepening of the voice. During adolescence, the thyroid cartilage grows together with the larynx. Consequently, the laryngeal prominence grows in size, mainly in men. Together, a larger soundboard is made up in phonation apparatus and, as a result, men get a deeper voice note.

==Society and Western culture==

While both men and women can possess an Adam&#x27;s apple, the larger frequency of its appearance in men has led to the perception of the Adam&#x27;s apple as an indicator of masculinity. As such, transgender women may choose to undergo cosmetic surgery to remove it from their necks, a process known as chondrolaryngoplasty, or colloquially as a &quot;tracheal shave&quot;. Transgender men may choose to augment and thereby enlarge the Adam&#x27;s apple, a process known as masculinization.

Chondrolaryngoplasty surgery is effective, and studies done by surgeons in Tel Aviv and Los Angeles have demonstrated complications to be few and, if present, transient.

There is also an additional surgery available, feminization laryngoplasty, also known as &quot;FemLar&quot;, which can safely reduce the Adam’s Apple to an extent greater than that which can be accomplished by a tracheal shave, given it explicitly operates on the vocal cords within the Adam’s Apple as opposed to avoiding them. However, feminization laryngoplasty is a reconstructive surgery that carries additional risks and has a very strong feminizing effect on the voice that may or may not be desirable to the patient. There are also far fewer practitioners who are known to be currently performing FemLar as it is far newer than the tracheal shave procedure.

==Etymology==

The English term &quot;Adam&#x27;s apple&quot; is a calque of Latin , which is found in European medical texts from as early as 1600. &quot;Adam&#x27;s Apple&quot; is found in a 1662 English translation of Thomas Bartholin&#x27;s 1651 work &quot;Anatomia&quot;.

The 1662 citation includes an explanation for the origin of the phrase: a piece of forbidden fruit was supposedly embedded in the throat of Adam, who according to the Abrahamic religions was the first man: This etymology is also proposed by &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot; and the 1913 edition of &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. The story is not found in the Bible or other Jewish, Christian, or Islamic writings.

Linguist Alexander Gode proposed in 1968 that the Latin phrase (literally: &#x27;Adam&#x27;s apple&#x27;) was a mistranslation of the Hebrew &quot; meaning &#x27;male bump. The confusion was supposedly due to the fact that in the Hebrew language the proper name &quot;Adam&quot; () literally means &quot;man&quot;, and the word for &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;tapuach&quot;, is similar to the word &quot;&quot; which means &quot;swollen&quot;, thus in combination: the swelling of a man.

The medical term &quot;prominentia laryngea&quot; (laryngeal prominence) was introduced by the &quot;Basle Nomina Anatomica&quot; in 1895.

In the American South, &quot;goozle&quot; is used colloquially to describe the laryngeal prominence, likely derived from &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="381796" wikidata="Q527750" url="?curid=381796" title="Yellow-headed blackbird">
<text>The yellow-headed blackbird (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus) is a medium-sized blackbird with a yellow head.

It is the only member of the genus Xanthocephalus. Their scientific name derives from the Greek word for yellow, &quot;xanthous&quot;, and the word for head, &quot;cephalus&quot;. 

== Description ==
Yellow-headed blackbirds are considered to be relatively large blackbirds with large, yellow heads. They measure 8.3–10.2 in (21–26 cm) in length, with a wingspan of 16.5–17.3 in (42–44 cm) and a weight of 1.6–3.5 oz (44–100 g).

Adults have a pointed bill. The adult male is mainly black with a yellow head and breast; they have a white wing patch sometimes only visible in flight. The adult female is mainly brown with a dull yellow throat and breast. Immature members of both sexes are brown with duller yellow plumage compared to adult males. Immature males also have some white patches on the wing. Both sexes resemble the respective sexes of the smaller yellow-hooded blackbird of South America.

== Behavior and ecology ==

=== Migration, habitat, and breeding ===
These birds migrate in the winter to the southwestern United States and Mexico. They often migrate in huge flocks with other species of birds. The only regions of the United States where these blackbirds are permanent residents are the San Joaquin Valley and the Lower Colorado River Valley of Arizona and California. It is an extremely rare vagrant to western Europe, with some records suspected to refer to escapes from captivity. When migrating, males and females travel separately. Males typically arrive at the breeding marshes 2–3 weeks before females during spring migration. Research suggests that females choose breeding sites based on the reproductive success (number of young per breeding female) of the site in previous years.

The breeding habitat of the yellow-headed blackbird are marshes in North America (mainly west of the Great Lakes), particularly in plants such as cattails (genus &quot;Typha&quot;), bulrush (genus &quot;Scirpus&quot;), and common reeds (genus &quot;Phragmites&quot;). The nest is built with and attached to marsh vegetation and is constructed over open water. They nest in colonies, often sharing their habitat closely with the red-winged blackbird (&quot;Agelaius phoeniceus&quot;). During the breeding and nesting season the males are very territorial and spend much of their time perched on reed stalks and displaying or chasing off intruders. 

=== Food ===
These birds eat seeds during majority of the year and insects throughout the summer months. They forage in marshes, fields, or on the ground; they sometimes catch insects in flight. Sunflowers are fairly popular amongst yellow-headed blackbirds in the Northern Great Plains, with a study indicating that males eat more sunflower than grains and females more grains than sunflower. Some methods of gathering food involve flipping over stones, catching insects from the top of water, and foraging. Foraging methods take place in uplands, with the flock taking a &quot;rolling&quot; formation in which birds fly from the back to the front of the flock to feed. Female yellow-headed blackbirds primarily feed their newly-hatched young insects from the order &quot;Odonata&quot;, which includes dragonflies and damselflies. Outside the nesting period, they often feed in flocks, often with related species.

=== Songs and calls ===
This bird&#x27;s song resembles the grating of a rusty hinge. Male yellow-headed blackbirds have been observed to have two types of songs, an &quot;accent song&quot; and a &quot;buzz song&quot;. The “buzz songs&quot; have much higher pitch than the accent song, and thus do not echo as well in the dense marshes they live in. For that reason, buzzing songs are typically done when communicating closer whereas accent songs are done to communicate with birds further in the marshes. Female birds have a song that is described to be similar to the male &quot;buzz song&quot;, consisting of harsh grating or buzz sounds. Both sexes are also found to elicit harsh calling notes.

=== Natural threats ===
Yellow‐headed blackbirds have been found to be sensitive to nest predation risk, for example by marsh wrens (&quot;Cistothorus palustris)&quot;, and alter their nest attendance behavior accordingly.

Raptors occasionally prey on yellow-headed blackbird flocks. For example, media outlets reported that on February 7, 2022, a flock of yellow-headed blackbirds migrating to Chihuahua, Mexico, were seen dropping dead in the early morning. According to experts, it is most likely that the birds were killed due to being flushed from above as a result of a predatory bird (presumably a raptor) chasing them, which caused some of them to fly into each other and crash into the ground and nearby buildings.

== Conservation ==
Because yellow-headed blackbirds typically reside in wetlands, their population numbers depend on the conditions of the wetlands in which they reside. For instance, drainage projects, herbicides/pesticides, and other crop protection methods have impacts on the health of wetlands, and consequently, cause the bird population to fluctuate in number. Currently, yellow-headed blackbird numbers are stable and will likely remain that way in the long term.

<text>James Franck (; 26 August 1882 – 21 May 1964) was a German physicist who won the 1925 Nobel Prize in Physics with Gustav Hertz &quot;for their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom&quot;. He completed his doctorate in 1906 and his habilitation in 1911 at the Frederick William University in Berlin, where he lectured and taught until 1918, having reached the position of professor extraordinarius. He served as a volunteer in the German Army during World War I. He was seriously injured in 1917 in a gas attack and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class.

Franck became the Head of the Physics Division of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft for Physical Chemistry. In 1920, Franck became professor ordinarius of experimental physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics at the University of Göttingen. While there he worked on quantum physics with Max Born, who was Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics. His work included the Franck–Hertz experiment, an important confirmation of the Bohr model of the atom. He promoted the careers of women in physics, notably Lise Meitner, Hertha Sponer and Hilde Levi.

After the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933, Franck resigned his post in protest against the dismissal of fellow academics. He assisted Frederick Lindemann in helping dismissed Jewish scientists find work overseas, before he left Germany in November 1933. After a year at the Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark, he moved to the United States, where he worked at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and then the University of Chicago. During this period he became interested in photosynthesis.

Franck participated in the Manhattan Project during World War II as Director of the Chemistry Division of the Metallurgical Laboratory. He was also the chairman of the Committee on Political and Social Problems regarding the atomic bomb, which is best known for the compilation of the Franck Report, which recommended that the atomic bombs not be used on the Japanese cities without warning.

== Early life ==
James Franck was born in Hamburg, Germany, on 26 August 1882, into a Jewish family, the second child and first son of Jacob Franck, a banker, and his wife Rebecca née Nachum Drucker. He had an older sister, Paula, and a younger brother, Robert Bernard. His father was a devout and religious man, while his mother came from a family of rabbis. Franck attended primary school in Hamburg. Starting in 1891 he attended the Wilhelm-Gymnasium, which was then a boys-only school.

Hamburg had no university then, so prospective students had to attend one of the 22 universities elsewhere in Germany. Intending to study law and economics, Franck entered the University of Heidelberg in 1901, as it had a renowned law school. He attended lectures on law, but was far more interested in those on science. While there, he met Max Born, who would become a lifelong friend. With Born&#x27;s help, he was able to persuade his parents to allow him to switch to studying physics and chemistry. Franck attended mathematics lectures by Leo Königsberger and Georg Cantor, but Heidelberg was not strong on the physical sciences, so he decided to go to the Frederick William University in Berlin.

At Berlin, Franck attended lectures by Max Planck and Emil Warburg. On 28 July 1904 he saved a pair of children from drowning in the Spree River. For his Doctor of Philosophy (Dir. Phil.) under Warburg&#x27;s supervision, Warburg suggested that he study corona discharges. Franck found this topic too complex, so he changed the focus of his thesis. Entitled &quot;Über die Beweglichkeit der Ladungsträger der Spitzenentladung&quot; (&quot;On the Mobility of Ions&quot;), it would subsequently be published in the &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot;.

With his thesis completed, Franck had to perform his deferred military service. He was called up on 1 October 1906 and joined the 1st Telegraph Battalion. He suffered a minor horse riding accident in December and was discharged as unfit for duty. He took up an assistantship at the Physikalische Verein in Frankfurt in 1907, but did not enjoy it, and soon returned to Frederick William University. At a concert Franck met Ingrid Josephson, a Swedish pianist. They were married in a Swedish ceremony in Gothenburg on 23 December 1907. They had two daughters, Dagmar (Daggie), who was born in 1909, and Elisabeth (Lisa), who was born in 1912.

To pursue an academic career in Germany, having a doctorate was not enough; one needed a &quot;venia legendi&quot;, or habilitation. This could be achieved with either another major thesis or by producing a substantial body of published work. Franck chose the latter route. There were many unsolved problems in physics at the time, and by 1914 he had published 34 articles. He was the sole author of some, but generally preferred working in collaboration with Eva von Bahr, Lise Meitner, Robert Pohl, , Robert W. Wood, Arthur Wehnelt or Wilhelm Westphal. His most fruitful collaboration was with Gustav Hertz, with whom he wrote 19 articles. He received his habilitation on 20 May 1911.

== Franck–Hertz experiment ==
In 1914, Franck teamed up with Hertz to perform an experiment to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9 electronvolts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely the same amount of its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.

These experimental results provided confirmation of Albert Einstein&#x27;s photoelectric effect and Planck&#x27;s relation () linking energy (&quot;E&quot;) and frequency (&quot;f&quot;) arising from quantisation of energy with the Planck constant (&quot;h&quot;). But they also provided evidence supporting the model of the atom that had been proposed the previous year by Niels Bohr. Its key feature was that an electron inside an atom occupies one of the atom&#x27;s &quot;quantum energy levels&quot;. Before a collision, an electron inside the mercury atom occupies its lowest available energy level. After the collision, the electron inside occupies a higher energy level with 4.9 eV more energy. This means that the electron is more loosely bound to the mercury atom. There were no intermediate levels or possibilities.

In a second paper presented in May 1914, Franck and Hertz reported on the light emission by the mercury atoms that had absorbed energy from collisions. They showed that the wavelength of this ultraviolet light corresponded exactly to the 4.9 eV of energy that the flying electron had lost. The relationship of energy and wavelength had also been predicted by Bohr. Franck and Hertz completed their last paper together in December 1918. In it, they reconciled the discrepancies between their results and Bohr&#x27;s theory, which they now acknowledged. In his Nobel lecture, Franck admitted that it was &quot;completely incomprehensible that we had failed to recognise the fundamental significance of Bohr&#x27;s theory, so much so, that we never even mentioned it once&quot;. On 10 December 1926, Franck and Hertz were awarded the 1925 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom.&quot;.
== World War I ==
Franck enlisted in the German Army soon after the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. In December he was sent to the Picardy sector of the Western Front. He became a deputy officer (&quot;offizierstellvertreter&quot;), and then a lieutenant (&quot;leutnant&quot;) in 1915. In early 1915 he was transferred to Fritz Haber&#x27;s new unit that would introduce clouds of chlorine gas as a weapon. With Otto Hahn he was responsible for locating sites for the attacks. He was awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class, on 30 March 1915, and the city of Hamburg awarded him the Hanseatic Cross on 11 January 1916. While in hospital with pleurisy, he co-wrote yet another scientific paper with Hertz, and he was appointed an assistant professor in his absence by Frederick William University on 19 September 1916. Sent to the Russian front, he came down with dysentery. He returned to Berlin, where he joined Hertz, Westphal, Hans Geiger, Otto Hahn and others at Haber&#x27;s Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry, working on the development of gas masks. He was awarded the Iron Cross, First Class, on 23 February 1918. He was discharged from the Army on 25 November 1918, soon after the war ended.

With the war over, Haber&#x27;s Kaiser Wilhelm Institute now returned to research, and Haber offered Franck a job. His new post came with more pay, but was not a tenured position. It did however allow Franck to pursue his research as he wished. Working with new, younger collaborators such as Walter Grotrian, Paul Knipping, Thea Krüger, Fritz Reiche and Hertha Sponer, his first papers at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute examined atomic electrons in their excited state, results that would later prove important in the development of the laser. They coined the term &quot;metastable&quot; for atoms spending an extended time in a state other than that of least energy. When Niels Bohr visited Berlin in 1920, Meitner and Franck arranged for him to come to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute to talk with the younger staff without the presence of the &quot;bonzen&quot; (&quot;bigwigs&quot;).

== Göttingen ==

In 1920, the University of Göttingen offered Max Born its chair of theoretical physics, which had recently been vacated by Peter Debye. Göttingen was an important centre for mathematics, thanks to David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Hermann Minkowski and Carl Runge, but not so much for physics. This would change. As part of his price for coming to Göttingen, Born wanted Franck to head experimental physics there. On 15 November 1920, Franck became Professor of Experimental Physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics, a fully tenured &quot;professor ordinarius&quot;. He was allowed two assistants, so he brought Hertha Sponer with him from Berlin to fill one of the positions. Pohl, a gifted teacher, headed the First Institute, and handled the lectures. Franck refurbished the laboratory with the latest equipment using funds from his own pocket.

Under Born and Franck, Göttingen was one of the world&#x27;s great centres for physics between 1920 and 1933. Although they published only three papers together, Born and Franck discussed every one of their papers with each other. Gaining admittance to Franck&#x27;s laboratory became highly competitive. His doctoral students included Hans Kopfermann, Arthur R. von Hippel, Wilhelm Hanle, Fritz Houtermans, Heinrich Kuhn, , Walter Lochte-Holtgreven and Heinz Maier-Leibnitz. In supervising doctoral candidates, Franck had to ensure that thesis topics were well-defined, and would teach the candidate how to conduct original research, while still staying within the limits of the candidate&#x27;s ability, the laboratory&#x27;s equipment and the institute&#x27;s budget. Under his direction, research was carried out into the structure of atoms and molecules.

In his own research, Franck developed what became known as the Franck–Condon principle, a rule in spectroscopy and quantum chemistry that explains the intensity of vibronic transitions, simultaneous changes in electronic and vibrational energy levels of a molecule due to the absorption or emission of a photon of the appropriate energy. The principle states that during an electronic transition, a change from one vibrational energy level to another will be more likely to happen if the two vibrational wave functions overlap more significantly. The principle has since been applied to a wide variety of related phenomena.

For his work during this time period, Franck was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1929.

== Exile ==
This period came to an end when the Nazi Party won power in Germany in an election on 2 March 1933. The following month it enacted the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which provided for the retirement or dismissal of all Jewish civil servants, along with political opponents of the government. As a veteran of the First World War, Franck was exempt, but he submitted his resignation anyway on 17 April 1933. He once commented that science was his God and nature was his religion. He did not require his daughters to attend religious instruction classes at school, and even let them have a decorated tree at Christmas; but he was proud of his Jewish heritage all the same. He was the first academic to resign in protest over the law. Newspapers around the world reported it, but no government or university protested.

Franck assisted Frederick Lindemann in helping dismissed Jewish scientists find work overseas, before he left Germany in November 1933. After a brief visit to the United States, where he measured the absorption of light in heavy water with Wood at Johns Hopkins University, he took up a position at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. He needed a new collaborator, so he took on Hilde Levi, whose recent thesis had impressed him. His original intention was to continue his research into the fluorescence of vapours and liquids, but under Bohr&#x27;s influence they began to take an interest in biological aspects of these reactions, particularly photosynthesis, the process by which plants use light to convert carbon dioxide and water into more organic compounds. Biological processes turned out to be far more complicated than simple reactions in atoms and molecules. He co-authored two papers with Levi on the subject, which he would return to over the following years.

Franck found a position at the &quot;Polytekniske Læreanstalt&quot; in Copenhagen for Arthur von Hippel, who was now his son in law, having married his daughter Dagmar. He decided to provide financial security for his children by dividing his Nobel Prize money between them. The gold medal itself was entrusted to Niels Bohr for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940, the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy dissolved the gold medal, along with that of Max von Laue in aqua regia to prevent the Germans from taking them. He placed the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then recast the Nobel Prize medals.

In 1935, Franck moved to the United States, where he had accepted a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared to the one in Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.

Franck&#x27;s first paper there, co-authored with Edward Teller, was on photochemical processes in crystals. Hans Gaffron became his collaborator. They were joined by Pringsheim, who escaped from Belgium after the German invasion. Franck arranged a position for Pringsheim at his laboratory. Both his daughters and their families moved to the United States, and he was also able to bring out his elderly mother and aunt. He became a naturalised United States citizen on 21 July 1941, so he was not an enemy alien when the United States declared war on Germany on 11 December 1941. His daughters still were, though, so they were restricted from travelling, and could not take care of their mother when she fell ill and died on 10 January 1942, although they were permitted to attend her funeral.

In February 1942, Arthur H. Compton established its Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. As part of the Manhattan Project, its mission was to build nuclear reactors to create plutonium that would be used in atomic bombs. The Metallurgical Laboratory&#x27;s Chemistry Division was initially headed by Frank Spedding, but he preferred hands on work to administration. Compton then turned to Franck, with some trepidation owing to his German background. Compton later wrote:

In addition to heading the Chemistry Division, Franck was also the chairman of the Metallurgical Laboratory&#x27;s Committee on Political and Social Problems regarding the atomic bomb, which consisted of himself and Donald J. Hughes, J. J. Nickson, Eugene Rabinowitch, Glenn T. Seaborg, J. C. Stearns and Leó Szilárd. In 1945, Franck warned Henry A. Wallace of their fears that &quot;mankind has learned to unleash atomic power without being ethically and politically prepared to use it wisely.&quot; The committee compiled what became known as the Franck Report. Finished on 11 June 1945, it recommended that the atomic bombs not be used on the Japanese cities without warning. In any event, the Interim Committee decided otherwise.

== Later life ==
Franck married Hertha Sponer in a civil ceremony on 29 June 1946, his first wife, Ingrid, having died in 1942. In his post-war research, he continued to tackle the problem of explaining the mechanism of photosynthesis. Meitner saw no break between his early and later work. She recalled that

In addition to the Nobel Prize. Franck was awarded the Max Planck medal of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft in 1951 and the Rumford Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for his work on photosynthesis in 1955. He became an honorary citizen of Göttingen in 1953, was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1944, and elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1964. He was also an International Member of the American Philosophical Society.

He died suddenly from a heart attack while visiting Göttingen on 21 May 1964, and was buried in Chicago with his first wife.

In 1967, the University of Chicago named the James Franck Institute after him. A lunar crater has also been named in his honour. His papers are in the University of Chicago Library.

<doc id="381798" wikidata="Q1165112" url="?curid=381798" title="Singleton (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, a singleton (also known as a unit set or one-point set) is a set with exactly one element. For example, the set formula_1 is a singleton whose single element is formula_2.

==Properties==
Within the framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the axiom of regularity guarantees that no set is an element of itself. This implies that a singleton is necessarily distinct from the element it contains, thus 1 and formula_3 are not the same thing, and the empty set is distinct from the set containing only the empty set. A set such as formula_4 is a singleton as it contains a single element (which itself is a set, but not a singleton).

A set is a singleton if and only if its cardinality is . In von Neumann&#x27;s set-theoretic construction of the natural numbers, the number 1 is &quot;defined&quot; as the singleton formula_5

In axiomatic set theory, the existence of singletons is a consequence of the axiom of pairing: for any set &quot;A&quot;, the axiom applied to &quot;A&quot; and &quot;A&quot; asserts the existence of formula_6 which is the same as the singleton formula_7 (since it contains &quot;A&quot;, and no other set, as an element).

If &quot;A&quot; is any set and &quot;S&quot; is any singleton, then there exists precisely one function from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;S&quot;, the function sending every element of &quot;A&quot; to the single element of &quot;S&quot;. Thus every singleton is a terminal object in the category of sets.

A singleton has the property that every function from it to any arbitrary set is injective. The only non-singleton set with this property is the empty set.

Every singleton set is an ultra prefilter. If formula_8 is a set and formula_9 then the upward of formula_10 in formula_11 which is the set formula_12 is a principal ultrafilter on formula_8. Moreover, every principal ultrafilter on formula_8 is necessarily of this form. The ultrafilter lemma implies that non-principal ultrafilters exist on every infinite set (these are called ). 
Every net valued in a singleton subset formula_8 of is an ultranet in formula_16

The Bell number integer sequence counts the number of partitions of a set (), if singletons are excluded then the numbers are smaller ().

==In category theory==

Structures built on singletons often serve as terminal objects or zero objects of various categories:
* The statement above shows that the singleton sets are precisely the terminal objects in the category Set of sets. No other sets are terminal.
* Any singleton admits a unique topological space structure (both subsets are open). These singleton topological spaces are terminal objects in the category of topological spaces and continuous functions. No other spaces are terminal in that category.
* Any singleton admits a unique group structure (the unique element serving as identity element). These singleton groups are zero objects in the category of groups and group homomorphisms. No other groups are terminal in that category.

==Definition by indicator functions==
Let be a class defined by an indicator function 
formula_17
Then is called a &quot;singleton&quot; if and only if there is some formula_18 such that for all formula_19
formula_20

==Definition in &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;==
The following definition was introduced by Whitehead and Russell 
:formula_21‘formula_22 Df.
The symbol formula_21‘formula_24 denotes the singleton formula_10 and formula_26 denotes the class of objects identical with formula_24 aka formula_28. 
This occurs as a definition in the introduction, which, in places, simplifies the argument in the main text, where it occurs as proposition 51.01 (p. 357 ibid.).
The proposition is subsequently used to define the cardinal number 1 as
:formula_29‘formula_30 Df. 
That is, 1 is the class of singletons. This is definition 52.01 (p. 363 ibid.)

<text>Lewis Barrett Welch Jr. (August 16, 1926 – May 23, 1971) was an American poet associated with the Beat generation literary movement.

Welch published and performed widely during the 1960s. He taught a poetry workshop as part of the University of California Extension in San Francisco, from 1965 to 1970.

He is believed to have committed suicide, after leaving a note on May 23, 1971. His body was never found.

==Early life==
Welch was born in Phoenix, Arizona, and moved with his mother and sister to California in 1929. The family often moved, and he graduated from Palo Alto High School. He enlisted in the Army Air Forces in 1944 but never saw active service. He worked for a period before attending Stockton Junior College, where he developed an interest in the works of Gertrude Stein.

In 1948, Welch moved to Portland, Oregon, to attend Reed College. There he roomed with fellow poet Gary Snyder and also befriended Philip Whalen. Welch decided to become a writer after reading Gertrude Stein&#x27;s long story &quot;Melanctha.&quot; Welch wrote his thesis on Stein and published poems in student magazines. William Carlos Williams visited the college and met the three poets. He admired Welch&#x27;s early poems and tried to get his Stein thesis published.

==New York and Chicago==
After college, Welch moved to New York City, where he worked writing copy in the advertising industry. Welch was said to have come up with the advertising slogan,&quot;Raid Kills Bugs Dead,&quot; but some have questioned this claim. During this time, Welch started to display emotional and mental problems and went to Florida to take a course of therapy.

He then went to the University of Chicago, where he studied philosophy and English. In Chicago, he joined the advertising department of Montgomery Ward.

==Later life and work==
Wanting to get back to poetry, Welch applied for a transfer to Montgomery Ward&#x27;s Oakland headquarters. After the return to California, he started to get involved in the San Francisco literary scene. He soon gave up advertising and earned a living driving a cab while devoting more time to writing. He became an active participant in Beat culture, living at various times with Snyder and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. In 1960, poet Lenore Kandel met Welch and Snyder, who introduced her to many people in the Beat movement.

Jack Kerouac based his character Dave Wain in his novel &quot;Big Sur&quot; (1962) on Welch. In 1968, Welch signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

==Personal life==
Welch had a common-law relationship with Polish refugee Maria Magdalena Cregg. He acted as the stepfather to her son Hugh Anthony Cregg III, better known by his stage-name Huey Lewis.

==Death==
On May 23, 1971, Welch walked out of poet Gary Snyder&#x27;s house in the mountains of California, leaving behind a suicide note. He had with him a stainless steel Smith &amp; Wesson .22 caliber revolver. His body was never found.

==Bibliography==
Note: Before committing suicide in 1971, Lew Welch left a note naming Donald Allen his literary executor. Donald Allen published much of Welch&#x27;s work posthumously via Grey Fox Press.

<doc id="381800" wikidata="Q1145521" url="?curid=381800" title="Hollywood North">
<text>Hollywood North is a colloquialism used to describe film production industries and/or film locations north of its namesake, Hollywood, California. The term has been applied principally to the film industry in Canada, specifically to the cities Toronto and Vancouver.

==Use of the term==
The title has been claimed for both Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia.

=== Toronto ===
One of the earliest Hollywood television series to shoot in Toronto was the 1957 production &quot;Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans&quot;. The city has been associated with the nickname &#x27;Hollywood North&#x27; since the late 1970s, due to its role as a production centre for both domestic and international film projects. In 1979 Toronto mayor John Sewell announced that Canada had become the third largest movie production centre after Los Angeles and New York.

In 2002 the year Toronto&#x27;s Film and Television industry accounted for $1.16 billion towards the city&#x27;s economy, former Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman proclaimed &quot;Toronto is Hollywood North&quot;. In 2003 the Toronto Ontario Film Office was established in Los Angeles to promote the benefits of filming in the city of Toronto and the province of Ontario. With the TOFO Ontario is the only Canadian province to have an office in Hollywood. The province of Ontario had 230 film projects with $946 million in production spending in 2010.

Ontario ranks as the second largest film and television production centre in Canada, and fourth overall in North America behind California, New York, and British Columbia. Although a decline in BC&#x27;s domestic production and an increase of $300 million or 31% over the previous year, allowed Ontario to surpass British Columbia for the largest production centre in Canada in 2011, British Columbia has once again surpassed Ontario in recent years, as it had historically. The province recorded $1.26 billion in production activity in 2011, its largest year ever. By 2017, Toronto itself grew to $2 billion.

Toronto ranks fourth as an exporter of television programming in North America and behind only Los Angeles, New York City, and Vancouver among North American cities in total industry production, $903.5 million were spent by production companies on 209 major production film and television projects in 2010 in Toronto. In 2011, the film industry contributed $1.13 billion from 244 on location film and television projects to Toronto the largest figure since the year 2002, this increase in revenue over the past years was attributed to a film tax credit offered by the provincial government in 2009. A 47% increase in Hollywood productions in 2011 over 2010 was mostly attributed to this tax credit among others. In 2012 on location film and television production increased again to $1.2 billion generated.

Toronto is the headquarters of Nelvana, the largest animation company in Canada and one of the largest animation/children&#x27;s entertainment studios in the world. Toronto was also the headquarters of Alliance Atlantis, the largest film distribution company in Canada, and the 12th largest film and TV distribution company in the world, which distributes films and television across all of North America and parts of Europe.

Pinewood Toronto Studios located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada is Canada&#x27;s largest film and television production complex, with more than of production space. It contains the largest purpose-built sound stage in North America, capable of accommodating large blockbuster movies. Some have credited the completion of Pinewood Studios along with provincial tax credits as being responsible for the late 2000s/early 2010s surge in in-province Hollywood productions. Due to its ability to handle film productions on a scale not previously possible.

The Toronto Film and Television Office reported that in 2005 some 200 productions were completed in Toronto: 39 features, and 44 movies made for television, 84 television series, 11 television specials, and 22 MOW&#x27;s (movies of the week). The Toronto Film and Television Office issued 4,154 location filming permits for 1,258 projects totalling 7,319 days of shooting. Toronto&#x27;s domestic production industry benefits greatly financially from large treaty coproductions with international partners.

As with Vancouver, government tax incentives at both the provincial and federal level promote Toronto as a destination for many US film productions. The city is often used as a stand in for New York City and Chicago in film.

In addition to being a productions centre, Toronto is the home to the Toronto International Film Festival, which is considered by many in the film industry to be second only to Cannes in terms of influence or in instances actually rivaling it. It attracts numerous high-profile actors and film makers from around the globe to premiere their Films in Toronto and is generally considered the tip-off point to which the Oscar races begin.

Toronto is home to Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame, similar in appearance to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, honouring notable Canadians.

Toronto is the headquarters to the majority of Canada&#x27;s national media outlets including: CBC Television, CTV, Global Television Network, MuchMusic, YTV, and entertainment programs ETalk and &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. The city is the traditional host for the Gemini Awards, honouring the Canadian television industry.

=== Vancouver ===
Vancouver has been used as a filmmaking location for over a century, beginning with &quot;The Cowpuncher&#x27;s Glove&quot; and &quot;The Ship&#x27;s Husband&quot;, both shot in 1910 by the Edison Manufacturing Company. Isolated by distance from the domestic film production communities in Toronto and Montreal, it became known as &quot;Hollywood North&quot; for its role as a production centre for US feature films shot in British Columbia. The provincial government first established a film development office in 1977 to market the province to the Hollywood community. In 2000, BC crossed the billion-dollar mark in production for the first time, and in 2002, 75% of all Canadian foreign productions were based in British Columbia and Ontario. That same year British Columbia led the country in foreign film production receiving 44% of the Canadian total. This would grow to nearly 64% of the Canadian total by 2017/18. 

British Columbia is currently the third largest production centre for film and television in North America, after Los Angeles and New York City, and has held this title for years with over 246 motion picture projects and $1.02 billion on production spending in 2010. Although declining domestic production in the province through 2011 and less competitive tax rates left BC ranking fourth in overall production after Ontario for a few years, British Columbia has regained its position as the third largest production centre in North America with American studios returning in droves thanks largely to existing infrastructure and talent.

North Shore Studios — formerly Lionsgate Studios — and Vancouver Film Studios are among the two largest special effects stages in Canada. VFS being one of the largest production facility outside of Los Angeles; Bridge Studios, in Burnaby, British Columbia, has one of the largest special effects stages in North America. Mammoth Studios, a subsidiary of North Shore studios holds the largest film stages in the world, their largest at . As of 2020, over of studio and production space is being added. Vancouver is also home to the world’s largest VFX/animation cluster with over 60 domestic and foreign-owned studios, and 17 educational institutions with motion picture production as a discipline.

The BC Film Commission reported that in 2005, more than 200 productions were completed in B.C.: 63 feature films, 31 television series, 37 movies-of-the-week, 15 television pilots, 5 miniseries, 20 documentaries, 16 short films and 24 animation projects. In 2006, spending on film and TV production in B.C. was $1.228 billion. The Great Recession of the late 2000s hit the film industry financially on all levels. By March 2008, the British Columbia film industry dramatically recovered with film spending at $1.2 billion, with foreign-film production increasing 146 percent and domestic animation by 79 percent. In total, 86 foreign productions including 40 feature-length films, were completed in 2008. The city is also host to the Vancouver International Film Festival and the Vancouver Film and Television Forum. 

Vancouver is from Hollywood, a three-hour airplane flight or a 20-hour drive. It is also in the same time zone as Los Angeles. This relative proximity, diverse geography, educational capacity, and local talent, coupled with government subsidies, is a major factor in the growth of Vancouver&#x27;s production industry. Proximity reduces issues over operating hours, accessibility, travel time for principals, access to filmmaking infrastructure, and experience of crews.

<doc id="381805" wikidata="Q726406" url="?curid=381805" title="Franck–Hertz experiment">
<text>The Franck–Hertz experiment was the first electrical measurement to clearly show the quantum nature of atoms. It was presented on April 24, 1914, to the German Physical Society in a paper by James Franck and Gustav Hertz. Franck and Hertz had designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapor of mercury atoms. They discovered that, when an electron collided with a mercury atom, it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9 electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. This energy loss corresponds to decelerating the electron from a speed of about 1.3 million metres per second to zero. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely the same amount of its kinetic energy. Slower electrons merely bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.

These experimental results proved to be consistent with the Bohr model for atoms that had been proposed the previous year by Niels Bohr. The Bohr model was a precursor of quantum mechanics and of the electron shell model of atoms. Its key feature was that an electron inside an atom occupies one of the atom&#x27;s &quot;quantum energy levels&quot;. Before the collision, an electron inside the mercury atom occupies its lowest available energy level. After the collision, the electron inside occupies a higher energy level with 4.9 electronvolts (eV) more energy. This means that the electron is more loosely bound to the mercury atom. There were no intermediate levels or possibilities in Bohr&#x27;s quantum model. This feature was &quot;revolutionary&quot; because it was inconsistent with the expectation that an electron could be bound to an atom&#x27;s nucleus by any amount of energy.

In a second paper presented in May 1914, Franck and Hertz reported on the light emission by the mercury atoms that had absorbed energy from collisions. They showed that the wavelength of this ultraviolet light corresponded exactly to the 4.9 eV of energy that the flying electron had lost. The relationship of energy and wavelength had also been predicted by Bohr because he had followed the structure laid out by Hendrik Lorentz at the 1911 Solvay Congress. At Solvay, Hendrik Lorentz suggested after Einstein’s talk on quantum structure that the energy of a rotator be set equal to &quot;nhv&quot;. Therefore, Bohr had followed the instructions given in 1911 and copied the formula proposed by Lorentz and others into his 1913 atomic model. Lorentz had been correct. The quantization of the atoms matched his formula incorporated into the Bohr model. After a presentation of these results by Franck a few years later, Albert Einstein is said to have remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s so lovely it makes you cry.&quot;

On December 10, 1926, Franck and Hertz were awarded the 1925 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom&quot;.

== Experiment ==

Franck and Hertz&#x27;s original experiment used a heated vacuum tube containing a drop of mercury; they reported a tube temperature of 115 °C, at which the vapor pressure of mercury is about 100 pascals (about a thousandth of the atmospheric pressure). A contemporary Franck–Hertz tube is shown in the photograph. It is fitted with three electrodes: an electron-emitting, hot cathode; a metal mesh grid; and an anode. The grid&#x27;s voltage is positive relative to the cathode, so that electrons emitted from the hot cathode are drawn to it. The electric current measured in the experiment is due to electrons that pass through the grid and reach the anode. The anode&#x27;s electric potential is slightly negative relative to the grid, so that electrons that reach the anode have at least a corresponding amount of kinetic energy after passing the grid.
The graphs published by Franck and Hertz (see figure) show the dependence of the electric current flowing out of the anode upon the electric potential between the grid and the cathode.
* At low potential differences—up to 4.9 volts—the current through the tube increased steadily with increasing potential difference. This behavior is typical of true vacuum tubes that don&#x27;t contain mercury vapor; larger voltages lead to larger &quot;space-charge limited current&quot;.
* At 4.9 volts the current drops sharply, almost back to zero.
* The current then increases steadily once again as the voltage is increased further, until 9.8 volts is reached (exactly 4.9+4.9 volts).
* At 9.8 volts a similar sharp drop is observed.
* While it isn&#x27;t evident in the original measurements of the figure, this series of dips in current at approximately 4.9 volt increments continues to potentials of at least 70 volts.

Franck and Hertz noted in their first paper that the 4.9 eV characteristic energy of their experiment corresponded well to one of the wavelengths of light emitted by mercury atoms in gas discharges. They were using a quantum relationship between the energy of excitation and the corresponding wavelength of light, which they broadly attributed to Johannes Stark and to Arnold Sommerfeld; it predicts that 4.9 eV corresponds to light with a 254 nm wavelength. The same relationship was also incorporated in Einstein&#x27;s 1905 photon theory of the photoelectric effect. In a second paper, Franck and Hertz reported the optical emission from their tubes, which emitted light with a single prominent wavelength 254 nm. The figure at the right shows the spectrum of a Franck–Hertz tube; nearly all of the light emitted has a single wavelength. For reference, the figure also shows the spectrum for a mercury gas discharge light, which emits light at several wavelengths besides 254 nm. The figure is based on the original spectra published by Franck and Hertz in 1914. The fact that the Franck–Hertz tube emitted just the single wavelength, corresponding nearly exactly to the voltage period they had measured, was very important.

== Modeling of electron collisions with atoms ==

Franck and Hertz explained their experiment in terms of elastic and inelastic collisions between the electrons and the mercury atoms. Slowly moving electrons collide elastically with the mercury atoms. This means that the direction in which the electron is moving is altered by the collision, but its speed is unchanged. An elastic collision is illustrated in the figure, where the length of the arrow indicates the electron&#x27;s speed. The mercury atom is unaffected by the collision, mostly because it is about four hundred thousand times more massive than an electron.

When the speed of the electron exceeds about 1.3 million metres per second, collisions with a mercury atom become inelastic. This speed corresponds to a kinetic energy of 4.9 eV, which is deposited into the mercury atom. As shown in the figure, the electron&#x27;s speed is reduced, and the mercury atom becomes &quot;excited&quot;. A short time later, the 4.9 eV of energy that was deposited into the mercury atom is released as ultraviolet light that has a wavelength of precisely 254 nm. Following light emission, the mercury atom returns to its original, unexcited state.

If electrons emitted from the cathode flew freely until they arrived at the grid, they would acquire a kinetic energy that&#x27;s proportional to the voltage applied to the grid. 1 eV of kinetic energy corresponds to a potential difference of 1 volt between the grid and the cathode. Elastic collisions with the mercury atoms increase the time it takes for an electron to arrive at the grid, but the average kinetic energy of electrons arriving there isn&#x27;t much affected.

When the grid voltage reaches 4.9 V, electron collisions near the grid become inelastic, and the electrons are greatly slowed. The kinetic energy of a typical electron arriving at the grid is reduced so much that it cannot travel further to reach the anode, whose voltage is set to slightly repel electrons. The current of electrons reaching the anode falls, as seen in the graph. Further increases in the grid voltage restore enough energy to the electrons that suffered inelastic collisions that they can again reach the anode. The current rises again as the grid potential rises beyond 4.9 V. At 9.8 V, the situation changes again. Electrons that have traveled roughly halfway from the cathode to the grid have already acquired enough energy to suffer a first inelastic collision. As they continue slowly towards the grid from the midway point, their kinetic energy builds up again, but as they reach the grid they can suffer a second inelastic collision. Once again, the current to the anode drops. At intervals of 4.9 volts this process will repeat; each time the electrons will undergo one additional inelastic collision.

== Early quantum theory ==

While Franck and Hertz were unaware of it when they published their experiments in 1914, in 1913 Niels Bohr had published a model for atoms that was very successful in accounting for the optical properties of atomic hydrogen. These were usually observed in gas discharges, which emitted light at a series of wavelengths. Ordinary light sources like incandescent light bulbs emit light at all wavelengths. Bohr had calculated the wavelengths emitted by hydrogen very accurately.

The fundamental assumption of the Bohr model concerns the possible binding energies of an electron to the nucleus of an atom. The atom can be ionized if a collision with another particle supplies at least this binding energy. This frees the electron from the atom, and leaves a positively charged ion behind. There is an analogy with satellites orbiting the Earth. Every satellite has its own orbit, and practically any orbital distance, and any satellite binding energy, is possible. Since an electron is attracted to the positive charge of the atomic nucleus by a similar force, so-called &quot;classical&quot; calculations suggest that any binding energy should also be possible for electrons. However, Bohr assumed that only a specific series of binding energies occur, which correspond to the &quot;quantum energy levels&quot; for the electron. An electron is normally found in the lowest energy level, with the largest binding energy. Additional levels lie higher, with smaller binding energies. Intermediate binding energies lying between these levels are not permitted. This was a revolutionary assumption.

Franck and Hertz had proposed that the 4.9 V characteristic of their experiments was due to ionization of mercury atoms by collisions with the flying electrons emitted at the cathode. In 1915 Bohr published a paper noting that the measurements of Franck and Hertz were more consistent with the assumption of quantum levels in his own model for atoms. In the Bohr model, the collision excited an internal electron within the atom from its lowest level to the first quantum level above it. The Bohr model also predicted that light would be emitted as the internal electron returned from its excited quantum level to the lowest one; its wavelength corresponded to the energy difference of the atom&#x27;s internal levels, which has been called the Bohr relation. Franck and Hertz&#x27;s observation of emission from their tube at 254 nm was also consistent with Bohr&#x27;s perspective. Writing following the end of World War I in 1918, Franck and Hertz had largely adopted the Bohr perspective for interpreting their experiment, which has become one of the experimental pillars of quantum mechanics. As Abraham Pais described it, &quot;Now the beauty of Franck and Hertz&#x27;s work lies not only in the measurement of the energy loss &quot;E&quot;2-&quot;E&quot;1 of the impinging electron, but they also observed that, when the energy of that electron exceeds 4.9 eV, mercury begins to emit ultraviolet light of a definite frequency &quot;ν&quot; as defined in the above formula. Thereby they gave (unwittingly at first) the first direct experimental proof of the Bohr relation!&quot; Franck himself emphasized the importance of the ultraviolet emission experiment in an epilogue to the 1960 Physical Science Study Committee (PSSC) film about the Franck–Hertz experiment.

== Experiment with neon ==

In instructional laboratories, the Franck–Hertz experiment is often done using neon gas, which shows the onset of inelastic collisions with a visible orange glow in the vacuum tube, and which also is non-toxic, should the tube be broken. With mercury tubes, the model for elastic and inelastic collisions predicts that there should be narrow bands between the anode and the grid where the mercury emits light, but the light is ultraviolet and invisible. With neon, the Franck–Hertz voltage interval is 18.7 volts, and an orange glow appears near the grid when 18.7 volts is applied. This glow will move closer to the cathode with increasing accelerating potential, and indicates the locations where electrons have acquired the 18.7 eV required to excite a neon atom. At 37.4 volts two distinct glows will be visible: one midway between the cathode and grid, and one right at the accelerating grid. Higher potentials, spaced at 18.7 volt intervals, will result in additional glowing regions in the tube.

An additional advantage of neon for instructional laboratories is that the tube can be used at room temperature. However, the wavelength of the visible emission is much longer than predicted by the Bohr relation and the 18.7 V interval. A partial explanation for the orange light involves two atomic levels lying 16.6 eV and 18.7 eV above the lowest level. Electrons excited to the 18.7 eV level fall to the 16.6 eV level, with concomitant orange light emission.

<text>Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India, or simply Lagaan, () is a 2001 Indian Hindi-language epic period musical sports drama film written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. The film was produced by Aamir Khan, who stars alongside debutant Gracy Singh and British actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne. Set in 1893, during the late Victorian period of British colonial rule in India, the film follows the inhabitants of a village in Central India, who, burdened by high taxes and several years of drought, are challenged by an arrogant British Indian Army officer to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid paying the taxes they owe. The villagers face the arduous task of learning a game that is alien to them and playing for a victory.

Produced on a budget of , &quot;Lagaan&quot; was the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. It faced multiple challenges during production: Khan was initially skeptical to star in a sports film, and later, prospective producers called for budget cuts and script modifications. Eventually, the film would become the maiden project of Aamir Khan Productions, and mark Khan&#x27;s foray into film production. Gowariker was inspired by aspects of sports drama &quot;Naya Daur&quot; (1957) in developing the film. The language featured in the film was based on Awadhi, but was diluted with standard Hindi for modern audiences. Principal photography took place in villages near Bhuj. Nitin Chandrakant Desai served as art director, while Bhanu Athaiya was the costume designer. The original soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar.

&quot;Lagaan&quot; was theatrically released in India on 15 June 2001, clashing with &quot;&quot;. It received widespread critical acclaim for Gowariker&#x27;s direction, Khan&#x27;s performance, dialogues, soundtrack, and the film&#x27;s anti-imperialist stance. With earnings of during its initial release, the film was the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 2001. &quot;Lagaan&quot; was screened at numerous international film festivals and garnered multiple accolades. It was the third, and as of 2024 the last, Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film after &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957) and &quot;Salaam Bombay!&quot; (1988). &quot;Lagaan&quot; became the most-awarded film at the 47th Filmfare Awards with eight wins, including Best Film, Best Director for Gowariker and Best Actor for Khan. At the 49th National Film Awards, the film won eight awards, including Best Popular Film.

== Plot ==
The farmers of the village of Champaner, in the British Central India Agency, live under an oppressive and racist regime, paying land tax (&quot;lagaan&quot;) despite poverty and an irregular harvest caused by drought. Unable to bear the burden, they ask the king, Raja Puran Singh, for relief from &quot;lagaan&quot;. The king is watching a cricket match between British officers. When he meets the villagers later, the regiment&#x27;s captain, Andrew Russell, proposes a cricket match against his team, allowing villagers exemption from &quot;lagaan&quot; for three years should they win (they would be liable for triple the usual tax should they lose). A young farmer named Bhuvan accepts Russell&#x27;s wager, and the match is scheduled to take place after three months.

Preparations for the match start slowly, as Bhuvan fails to unite the village in believing they have a chance. The few players who have enlisted for his team, try unsuccessfully to learn the game. Russell&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth, who is visiting from England and who empathises with the farmers, offers to coach Bhuvan&#x27;s team. Bhuvan gets eleven players as needed to compete for the match, though one of them, Lakha, secretly schemes with Russell to play against his own team. Meanwhile, Russell is berated by senior officers for gambling with the regiment&#x27;s treasury. He tries unsuccessfully to stop Elizabeth coaching the rival team, but she continues as she is secretly infatuated with Bhuvan. Bhuvan himself is unaware, courting the village medic&#x27;s daughter, Gauri.

The match is to be played over three days outside the cantonment grounds. On the first day, the British elect to bat (&quot;see: rules of cricket&quot;), and are aided by Lakha&#x27;s sabotage and inexperience of the locals, in putting up a good score. That night, farmers learn about Lakha&#x27;s betrayal from Elizabeth. They attack him but Bhuvan stands in his defence. Lakha redeems himself the next day by playing exceptionally, triggering a British collapse that ends their innings at 322, still a formidable score. The locals&#x27; innings starts with promise, but they lose almost all their best batters early. Bhuvan steadies the innings on the third day. In the final over, he hits six runs off the last ball to win the match for his team. Coincidentally, dark clouds gather in the sky and it begins raining heavily, signalling an end to the drought. The locals celebrate wildly, and Elizabeth catches Bhuvan and Gauri embracing amidst the crowd.

Following the defeat, Russell is relocated to Central Africa and the provincial regiment is disbanded. Elizabeth bids goodbye to the villagers, who are grateful for her coaching. She resists telling Bhuvan about her feelings for him, choosing to return to England, where she lives out her life unmarried. Meanwhile, Bhuvan marries Gauri in a grand ceremony blessed by Raja Puran Singh himself. Though Champaner&#x27;s triumph benefited the whole province, knowledge of the event escaped historical record altogether.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
&quot;Lagaan&quot; was inspired by &quot;Naya Daur&quot; (1957), a sports drama film directed by B. R. Chopra, written by Akhtar Mirza and Kamil Rashid, and starring Dilip Kumar, Vyjayanthimala and Ajit Khan.

Director Gowariker has stated that it was almost impossible to make &quot;Lagaan&quot;. He went to Khan, who agreed to participate after hearing the detailed script. Khan had initially rejected the idea of a &quot;sporty&quot; film, but was &quot;himself in tears&quot; upon hearing the full dialogued script. Even after securing Khan, Gowariker had trouble finding a producer. Producers who showed interest in the script wanted budget cuts as well as script modifications. Eventually, Khan agreed to Gowariker&#x27;s suggestion that he would produce the film. Khan corroborated this by saying that the faith he had in Gowariker, the story and script of the film, and the opportunity of starting his own production company inspired him to produce &quot;Lagaan&quot;. He also said that by being a producer himself, he was able to give greater creative freedom to Gowariker. He cited an example:
&quot;If the director tells the producer that he wants 50 camels, the latter will probably say, &#x27;Why not 25? Can&#x27;t you manage with 25 camels?&#x27; Whereas, if he is telling me the same thing... I will not waste time asking him questions because I am also creatively aware why he needs them.&quot;

Jhamu Sughand co-produced the film because he liked the emotional and patriotic story. &quot;Lagaan&quot; was made on a then-unprecedented budget of (), the highest for an Indian film of the time.

=== Casting ===
Gowariker first thought of Shah Rukh Khan, Bobby Deol, Hrithik Roshan and Abhishek Bachchan for the role of Bhuvan. After Bachchan chose to enter cinema with J. P. Dutta&#x27;s &quot;Refugee&quot; (2000), Khan was approached with the idea.

Several actresses had express interest to act in the female lead role in the film, but Khan needed someone who matched the description of the character given in the script. After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates to accommodate the film, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das, Shamita Shetty and Ameesha Patel were approached for the role, Gowariker selected Singh for the female lead because he was convinced that she was a good actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala. Singh, a newcomer, devoted all her time to the film. Since the script also demanded a British cast, Gowariker and Khan hired Danielle Roffe as one of the casting directors. After Danielle and Gowariker screen-tested many, Shelley and Blackthorne were chosen for the prime roles. Overall, the film cast 15 foreign actors.

Raghubir Yadav played the role of the legendary Haji Nasruddin in the teleplay &quot;Mullah Nasiruddin&quot; and has given many memorable performances such as &quot;Mungerilal Ke Haseen Sapne&quot;. Yadav was selected for the role of Bhura, a poultry farmer, based on his performance in &quot;Earth&quot; (1998). He had undergone an appendectomy during the filming schedule and returned to complete some of his scenes. Rajesh Vivek, who played the fortune teller Guran, was spotted by Gowariker in the film &quot;Junoon&quot; (1978). His liking for cricket helped him in his role. Raj Zutshi&#x27;s friendship with Khan and association in several films brought him the role of Ismail the potter after auditions. Pradeep Rawat&#x27;s association with Khan in &quot;Sarfarosh&quot; (1999) brought him the role of Deva, a Sikh ex-sepoy, which was initially intended for Mukesh Rishi. Rawat claimed that it was the highest ever compensation he received in his career. Daya Shankar Pandey, who preferred the role of Kachra, was known to Khan and Gowariker through previous films (&quot;Pehla Nasha&quot; (1993), &quot;Baazi&quot; (1995) and &quot;Ghulam&quot; (1998)). Pandey credited Gowariker for his acting in the film as Goli, saying that Gowariker and he would discuss the required emotions and expressions before shooting.

Yashpal Sharma was chosen by Gowariker for the role of Lakha, the woodcutter, after his portrayal in &quot;Samar&quot; (1999). He said it was a good experience working with Khan and Gowariker during the film. Amin Hajee earlier worked in a film with Gowariker. The friendly association brought Gowariker to him with the script, which he liked, and thereafter he successfully auditioned for his role of Bagha, a mute drummer. His knowledge of mute people and some assistance from a music band helped him better prepare for his role. Gowariker, who believed that Amin was like Sylvester Stallone, would refer to him as Stallone during filming. Aditya Lakhia&#x27;s association with Gowariker in &quot;Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa&quot; (1993) and &quot;Pehla Nasha&quot; (1993) brought him the role of Kachra, the untouchable. He read the book &quot;Everybody Loves a Good Drought&quot; by P. Sainath to better understand and portray his character.

=== Pre-production ===
One of the first members to join the production team was Nitin Chandrakant Desai, the art director, with whom Gowariker set out for extensive location hunt throughout India, to find the setting for the fictional town of Champaner, in late 1998. After searching through Rajasthan, Nasik, UP, they zeroed in on an ancient village near Bhuj, located in Gujarat&#x27;s Kutch district, by May 1999, where the film was primarily shot.

The script demanded a dry location: an agricultural village where it had not rained in several years. To depict the 1890s era, the crew also required a village which lacked electricity, communication and automobiles. Kutch faced the same problems at that time and hence the village of Kunariya, located a few miles away from Bhuj, was chosen. During the filming of &quot;Lagaan&quot;, it did not rain at all in the region. However, a week after the shoot finished, it rained heavily bringing relief to Bhuj, which had a lean monsoon the previous year. The typical old Kutch hamlet was built by the local people four months before the arrival of the crew. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake devastated this region and displaced many locals. The crew, including the English, contributed to their cause by donating , with further contributions during the year.

Avadhi, which is a dialect of Hindi, is primarily from a region in Uttar Pradesh. It was chosen to give the feel of the language spoken during that era. However, the language was diluted, and modern viewers can understand it. The dialogues, which were a combination of three dialects (Avadhi, Bhojpuri and Braj Bhasha) were penned by Hindi writer K. P. Saxena.

Bhanu Athaiya, who won an Oscar for her work in &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), was the costume designer for the film. With a large number of extras, it was difficult for her to make enough costumes. She spent a lot of time researching to lend authenticity to the characters.

=== Filming ===
The film took approximately a year to plan, which included ten months for production and one month for the development of Khan&#x27;s character, which the first-time producer found tiring. Khan obtained a crew of about 300 people for six months. Due to the lack of comfortable hotels in Bhuj, he hired a newly constructed apartment and furnished it completely for the crew. Security was set up and a special housekeeping team was brought to take care of the crew&#x27;s needs. Most of the 19th century tools and equipment depicted in the film were lent to the crew by the local villagers. Initially, they did not want to part with their equipment, but after much coaxing, they gave in. They then travelled to different parts of the country to collect the musical instruments used in that day and era.

During the shooting, Gowariker suffered from a slipped disc and had to rest for 30 days. During this period, he had his bed next to the monitor and continued with his work.

The filming schedule spanned the winter and summer, commencing in early January 2000 and finishing in mid-June. This was physically challenging for many, with the temperatures ranging from . The actors had to drink frequently and sit in the shade. The schedule was strict. The day began at 6 am, changing into costumes and getting onto the actors&#x27; bus, which took them to the sets in Kanuria. The actors, including Khan, all travelled on the same bus. If anyone missed it, it was up to them to reach the sets. One day, Khan was late and missed the actors&#x27; bus. That day, his wife Reena, the executive producer, reprimanded him for being late. She told him he had to set an example for the rest of the crew. &quot;If he started coming late, how could she tell the others to come on time?&quot; While on the sets, the actors were given call sheets with the day&#x27;s timetable such as breakfast, hairstyling, make-up, costumes, etc.

== Release ==
Before its worldwide release, Khan kept a promise to screen the film to the locals of Bhuj. &quot;Lagaan&quot; clashed with Anil Sharma&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, starring Sunny Deol and Ameesha Patel, at the box-office. The film made it to the UK Top 10 after its commercial release. It was the first Indian film to have a nationwide release in China and had its dubbed version released in Italy. With favorable reviews from the French press, &quot;Lagaan&quot; premiered in Paris on 26 June 2002 and continued to have an unprecedented nine weeks of screening with over 45,000 people watching. It was released in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, South Africa and the Middle East with respective vernacular subtitles. The film took a cumulative of $2.5 million at the international box-office and at the domestic box-office.

In 2001, &quot;Lagaan&quot; had a world premiere at the International Indian Film Academy Awards (IIFA) weekend in Sun City, South Africa. The Locarno International Film Festival authorities published the rules of cricket before the film was screened to a crowd which reportedly danced to its soundtrack in the aisles. &quot;Lagaan&quot; was shown 4 times due to public demand as against the usual norm of showcasing films once at the festival. It subsequently won the Prix du Public Award at the festival. After the film&#x27;s publicity in Locarno, the director, Gowariker said that distributors from Switzerland, Italy, France, Netherlands, North Africa, Finland and Germany were wanting to purchase the distribution rights. Special screenings were held in Russia, where people were keen to watch the film after its Oscar nomination.

Apart from these screenings, it was shown at the Sundance Film Festival, Cairo International Film Festival, Stockholm International Film Festival, Helsinki Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival. The film is available on Netflix.

=== Home media ===
There were two releases for the DVD. The first, as a 2-DVD set, was released on 27 May 2002 in limited regions. It contained subtitles in Arabic, English, Hebrew, Hindi, Turkish and several European languages. It is available in 16:9 Anamorphic widescreen, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, progressive 24 frame/s, widescreen and NTSC format. It carried an additional fifteen minutes of deleted scenes, filmographies and trailers.

The second was released as anniversary edition 3-disc DVD box after 6 years of the theatrical release. This also included &quot;Chale Chalo&quot; which was a documentary on the making of &quot;Lagaan&quot;, a curtain-raiser on the making of the soundtrack, deleted scenes, trailers, along with other collectibles such as 11 collector cards, a collectible &quot;Lagaan&quot; coin embossed with the character of &quot;Bhuvan&quot;, a 35 mm CinemaScope filmstrip hand-cut from the film&#x27;s filmstrip were bundled with the film. After its release, it became the highest-selling DVD in India, beating &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975). &quot;Chale Chalo – The Lunacy of Film Making&quot;, won the National Film Award for Best Exploration/Adventure Film.

A comic book, &quot;Lagaan: The Story&quot;, along with 2 colouring books, a mask book and a cricket board game were subsequently released to the commercial market. The comic book, available in English and Hindi, was targeted at children between the ages of 6 and 14. At the book&#x27;s launch, Aamir Khan said that they were keen to turn the film into a comic strip during the pre-production phase itself.

In March 2002, a book titled &quot;The Spirit of Lagaan – The Extraordinary Story of the Creators of a Classic&quot; was published. It covers the making of the film, describing in detail the setbacks and obstacles that the crew faced while developing the film from concept to its release.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Lagaan&quot; was met with critical acclaim. 

Sudish Kamath of &quot;The Hindu&quot; suggested that &quot;the movie is not just a story. It is an experience. An experience of watching something that puts life into you, that puts a cheer on your face, however depressed you might be.&quot; &quot;The Times of India&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Lagaan&quot; has all the attractions of big-sounding A. R. Rahman songs, excellent performances by Aamir Khan... and a successful debut for pretty Gracy Singh. In addition, there is the celebrated David vs. Goliath cricket match, which has the audiences screaming and clapping.&quot;

Roger Ebert, writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and wrote, &quot;&quot;Lagaan&quot; is an enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we&#x27;ve ever seen before, and yet completely familiar... At the same time, it&#x27;s a memory of the films we all grew up on, with clearly-defined villains and heroes, a love-triangle, and even a comic character who saves the day. &quot;Lagaan&quot; is a well-crafted, hugely entertaining epic that has the spice of a foreign culture.&quot; Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; suggested that it &quot;could be the trigger for Bollywood&#x27;s long-awaited crossover to non-ethnic markets&quot;. Somni Sengupta of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described it as &quot;a carnivalesque genre packed with romance, swordplay and improbable song-and-dance routines&quot;. Dave Kehr, another &quot;New York Times&quot; film critic, called &quot;Lagaan&quot; &quot;a movie that knows its business -- pleasing a broad, popular audience -- and goes about it with savvy professionalism and genuine flair.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; argued that the film is &quot;an affectionate homage to a popular genre that raises it to the level of an art film with fully drawn characters, a serious underlying theme, and a sophisticated style and point of view.&quot;

Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the film as &quot;a lavish epic, a gorgeous love story, and a rollicking adventure yarn. Larger than life and outrageously enjoyable, it&#x27;s got a dash of Spaghetti Western, a hint of Kurosawa, with a bracing shot of Kipling.&quot; Kuljinder Singh of the &quot;BBC&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Lagaan&quot; is anything but standard Bollywood fodder, and is the first must-see of the Indian summer. A movie that will have you laughing and crying, but leaving with a smile.&quot;

&quot;Lagaan&quot; was listed as #14 on &quot;Channel 4&quot;″s &quot;50 Films To See Before You Die&quot; and was the only Indian film to be listed. The film was also well-received in China, where its themes resonated with Chinese audiences. It was ranked #55 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. In 2011, John Nugent of the &quot;Trenton Independent&quot; called the film &quot;a masterpiece ... and what better way to learn a bit about India&#x27;s colonial experience! History and great entertainment, all rolled into one (albeit long) classic film.&quot;
== Awards ==

Aamir Khan and Gowariker went to Los Angeles to generate publicity for the Academy Awards. Khan said, &quot;We just started showing it to whoever we could, even the hotel staff.&quot; About India&#x27;s official entry to the 2002 Oscars, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote, &quot;A Bollywood film that portrays the British in India as ruthless sadists and Mafia-style crooks has been chosen as Delhi&#x27;s official entry to the Academy Awards.&quot; It added that the film was expected to win the nomination.

On 12 February 2002, &quot;Lagaan&quot; was nominated for the best foreign language film at the Academy Award nominations ceremony. After the nomination, Khan reacted by saying, &quot;To see the name of the film and actually hear it being nominated was very satisfying&quot;. Post-nomination reactions poured in from several parts of the world. &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote &quot;Hooray for Bollywood, and India&#x27;s &quot;Lagaan&quot;&quot;. With Sony Pictures Classics distributing the film and Oscar-winning director Baz Luhrmann praising it, &quot;Lagaan&quot; had a chance to win. The &quot;BBC&quot; commented that the nomination raised Bollywood hopes that Indian films would become more popular in the US. In India, the nomination was celebrated with news reports about a win bringing in &quot;a great boost for the Indian film industry&quot; and &quot;a Bharat Ratna for Aamir Khan and the status of a &#x27;national film&#x27; for Lagaan&quot;.

When &quot;Lagaan&quot; lost the award to the Bosnian film &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, there was disappointment in India. Khan said, &quot;Certainly we were disappointed. But the thing that really kept us in our spirits was that the entire country was behind us.&quot; Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt criticised the &quot;American film industry&quot; as &quot;insular and the foreign category awards were given just for the sake of it.&quot; Gowariker added that &quot;Americans must learn to like our films&quot;.

The film won a number of awards at Indian award ceremonies including eight National Film Awards, eight Filmfare Awards, eight Screen Awards and 10 IIFA Awards. Apart from these major awards, it also won awards at other national and international ceremonies.

<doc id="381811" wikidata="Q1931808" url="?curid=381811" title="Philip Delaporte">
<text>Reverend Philip Adam Delaporte ( 1868November 1928) was a German-born American Protestant missionary who ran a mission on Nauru with his wife from 1899 until 1915. During this time he translated numerous texts from German into Nauruan including the Bible and a hymnal. He was also one of the first to create a written form for the Nauruan dialect, published in a Nauruan-German dictionary.

==Early life==
Delaporte was born in Worms, Germany, c. 1868. At the age of 14, he immigrated to the United States. After being ordained, Delaporte worked on Butaritari with support from the Elim Mission in Los Angeles, California, U.S.

Delaporte and his wife, Salome, also a missionary, had five children. The eldest daughter was born in the U.S. The others, Paul, Mabel, Phillip, and Margaret, were born on Nauru. They were thought to be among the first white children born in the Marshall Islands.

==Missionary==
Germany annexed Nauru in 1888 as part of its Imperial German Pacific Protectorate, and German government administrators arrived in 1906, after the discovery of phosphate on the island. A Gilbertese pastor named Tabuia had founded the Nauru mission approximately 10 years before the Delaporte family&#x27;s arrival, but withdrew in 1892 at the request of the German government, leaving a small core of Nauruan Christians.

Delaporte and his family were sent to Nauru in 1899 by the Central Union Church of Honolulu to work under the auspices of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in Micronesia. They took over management of the mission and its associated school, the only formal educational institution on the island. Delaporte gained the trust of the Nauruans by carrying out medical work (because there was no doctor) and by teaching. The school taught reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, German, singing, and Bible history.

The Delaportes encouraged the Nauruans to dress in a more Western style including Mother Hubbard dresses, singlets (sleeveless shirt or vest), and Lavalavas (simple skirt). Polygyny was no longer allowed and traditional Nauruan dances were discouraged.

When the Pacific Phosphate Company gained control of phosphate mining on Nauru in 1906, Delaporte was able to take advantage of the company&#x27;s informal connections with the London Missionary Society (LMS) to benefit the mission. For example, the LMS assisted in acquiring printing machinery in Sydney, Australia, and the machinery was shipped to Nauru in cooperation with the mining company.

In 1907, Delaporte published a pocket German-Nauruan dictionary, &quot;Taschenwörterbuch Deutsch-Nauru&quot; (&quot;German-Nauruan Dictionary&quot;). The book contained an orthography, developed by Delaporte, consisting of 32 characters: b, p, d, t, g, k, q, j, r, w, m, n, ñ, c, f, h, l, s, z, i, e, a, à, â, o, ò, ô, ö, u, ù, û, and ü. The dictionary was nearly 100 pages, with 65 devoted to a glossary and a dozen to alphabetically arranged phrases in German and Nauruan. About 1650 German words appear in the dictionary, along with about 1300 &#x27;unique&#x27; Nauruan forms (excluding diacritical marks).

With help from his wife and a Nauruan named Timothy Detudamo, Delaporte translated many religious texts from German to Nauruan including the Bible, a catechism, a hymn book, a history of the Christian Church, and a book designed for use in the school. In 1915, when Delaporte returned to the U.S., he brought with him manuscript copies of the Bible and a hymnal in Nauruan. With assistance from Detudamo, who had accompanied Delaporte, these were published by the American Board press.

==Leaving Nauru==
The Delaportes returned to the United States several times during their tenure in Nauru, to work on publication of Philip&#x27;s translations and to visit their children who were in school in the U.S. They visited Boston in 1907, and in 1911 they went on furlough because Salome Delaporte was in poor health.

In 1914, control of Nauru switched to Great Britain. Also in 1914, the &quot;Missionary Herald&quot; printed a letter that Delaporte wrote early in the war in which he expressed sympathy for Germany, the country of his birth. This letter came to the attention of the British authorities on Nauru. While the Delaportes were in the U.S. in 1915, the British administrator wrote to the American Board stating that Delaporte was no longer welcome on the island. Delaporte was placed in charge of a German congregation in Muscatine, Iowa, U.S.

Delaporte died in November 1928 in Gridley, Illinois, at age 60.

<doc id="381815" wikidata="Q316913" url="?curid=381815" title="Louis I, Prince of Condé">
<text>Louis de Bourbon, 1st [[Prince of Condé]] (7 May 1530 – 13 March 1569) was a prominent Huguenot leader and general, the founder of the Condé branch of the House of Bourbon. Coming from a position of relative political unimportance during the reign of Henri II, Condé&#x27;s support for the Huguenots, along with his leading role in the conspiracy of Amboise and its aftermath, pushed him to the centre of French politics. Arrested during the reign of Francis II then released upon the latter&#x27;s premature death, he would lead the Huguenot forces in the first three civil wars of the French Wars of Religion before being executed after his defeat at the Battle of Jarnac in 1569.

==Early life==
Born in Vendôme, he was the fifth son of Charles de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme. His mother was Françoise d&#x27;Alençon, the eldest daughter of René, Duke of Alençon, and Margaret of Lorraine. His older brother Antoine de Bourbon married Jeanne d&#x27;Albret (Queen of Navarre). Their son, Condé&#x27;s nephew, became Henry IV of France. Condé&#x27;s cousin through his father (who was the brother of Antoinette de Bourbon) was Mary of Guise.

==Reigns of Henri II and Francis II==

===Reign of Henri II===
As a soldier in the French army, Condé fought at the Siege of Metz in 1552 where Francis, Duke of Guise successfully defended the city from the forces of Emperor Charles V. He, and his brother Enghien were responsible for the section of walls from Saint-Thibaut gate to the river Seille. He would also fight at the disastrous Battle of St. Quentin in 1557. Despite his military participation, neither he nor his brother would hold significant office during the reign of Henri, the king choosing instead to lavish it on his favourites Anne de Montmorency and Francis, Duke of Guise leaving Condé comparatively poor.

===Reign of Francis II===

====Death of Henri====
The sudden death of Henri II changed the landscape of French politics overnight, and Condé was present at his brother&#x27;s negotiations with the House of Montmorency and House of Bourbon-Montpensier as they sought to negotiate who would be the powerbroker for the young king. Ultimately the family would be outmanoeuvred by the Guise, who bought Condé off with a promise that he would receive the governorship of Picardy which his family claimed as a hereditary right, and a cash gift of 70,000 livres. Despite this bribe, opposition would grow to the new Guise administration from various factions, and Condé would find himself drawn to it. When his brother declined the Amboise conspirators&#x27; request for him to be their prince of the blood figurehead, they turned to Condé&#x27;s weaker claim as a junior prince of the blood, hoping he would lead them. As rumours of a conspiracy began to reach their ears, the Guise quickly came to suspect Condé&#x27;s involvement, and his governorship of Picardy failed to materialise.

====Conspiracy of Amboise====
In February the Guise finally had the proof of conspiracy they&#x27;d been looking for, from a conspirator who had gotten cold feet, and they moved the court to the secure castle of Amboise, and summoned the senior nobility to the castle including Condé, so that they might aid in the defence. As the conspirators were crushed over the following days, Condé could do little but watch from the battlements. Eager to avoid suspicion, Condé lingered at the court in the following days, angrily denouncing the rumours of his involvement that were swirling as the product of &#x27;scum.&#x27; He followed this up by calling anyone who would accuse him a liar, a serious rebuke in aristocratic circles, and offering to duel anyone who would dare accuse him to his face. While convinced of his guilt, the duke of Guise was conscious for the moment he lacked the necessary evidence, and assured Condé that no one doubted his honour. During his reassurance, his brother, Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine studiously looked at the floor. On 18 April, while Condé was attending the King&#x27;s levée, the Guise had his apartments raided for evidence, but, finding nothing, made no move against him. Very much aware of how much suspicion he was under, Condé took the opportunity to depart from court.
====Lyon, arrest, release====
Despite the failure of the attempt to seize the king at Amboise, disorder continued throughout the kingdom, as independent armies raised in support of the effort marauded in a guerrilla war. Condé continued to intrigue, planning to send troops to Lyon to seize the city and use it as a nucleus of opposition to the Guise. The uprising in Lyon was however discovered before it could begin, and the Guise suspicions of Condé and Navarre&#x27;s involvement was seemingly confirmed when the Guise captured an agent of Condé&#x27;s with papers that implicated him. Furious, and at last holding firm evidence, the brothers were invited to attend the upcoming Assembly of Notables. Conscious that they would certainly be arrested if they came, Navarre and Condé remained in the family powerbase of Vendôme. Hoping to isolate the Bourbon-Vendôme from their prince of the blood cousins, the Guise created two super-governorships controlling much of the country, giving one to Charles, Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon and the other to Louis, Duke of Montpensier. They then began assembling an army of 40000, warning the renegade brothers of what was to come if they did not present themselves at court for the Estates General of 1560-1. Possessing only 6000 foot soldiers between them, the two travelled north without a fight, and Condé was promptly arrested on 31 October.

The Guise set about arranging a trial for Condé on the charge of treason. Condé tried various methods to filibuster the proceedings, refusing to recognise the authority of his judges and demanding a trial by his peers. Despite this, he would be found guilty, and given an indeterminate prison sentence likely at the dungeons of Loches. Condé would not however languish in prison long, and soon the death of the young Francis II would sever the Guise&#x27;s link to political authority, opening the way for a regency government under Catherine de Medici. Conscious that the estates might prefer Navarre&#x27;s rights to the regency, Catherine used the leverage of Condé&#x27;s imprisonment to buy him off, promising to release him and annul his sentence in return for his support of her governance.

==Reign of Charles IX==

===Restoration to favour===
Condé was released from his captivity 15 days after the death of Francis II, on 20 December 1560. Navarre argued virulently on his behalf in council, making coded implications that revolt would break out if his brother was not restored to favour. Catherine managed to get him to withdraw his threat, and he submitted his recognition of her regency, excusing himself as only wishing to protect his brother from the charges of the Guise. Condé meanwhile, on parole, was waiting up in Picardy for news related to his case, keenly desiring revenge for his prosecution. Catherine oversaw the reconciliation of Navarre and Guise, and informed them that their personal reconciliation would be valid for their whole families. This accomplished, Catherine invited Condé to court. Condé set off with a force of 600 horse, however he was ordered by Catherine to disperse his retinue and come with no more than 25 horse. He arrived at Fontainebleau on the evening of 9 March. Not quite appreciating his situation, he immediately caused an incident by saying he would refuse to meet with the king until the duke of Guise was dismissed from his presence. Eventually he agreed to meet with them on the condition he need not say anything to Guise. On 13 March Condé swore in front of the court that he had never conspired against the king and the council formally absolved him, with an ordinance by Charles denoting this fact to be registered in &quot;Parlement&quot;. 

The court hoped this would be sufficient for Condé, however he remained curt with Guise, and sought a further validation of his innocence, a formal judgement from the &quot;Parlement&quot; that had convicted him, and a denunciation of his accusers. On 17 March he left Fontainebleau still threatening vengeance on his accusers and proceeded to Paris. On 1 April with a large retinue of 500 he attended a Calvinist service in the apartments of Coligny. The &quot;Parlement&quot; was consumed in its opposition to the Ordinance of Orléans and the Edict of 19 April and did not come to address the matter of Condé&#x27;s guilt until 13 June, when, under pressure, it declared his innocence. Catherine used the occasion to force the Duke of Guise and Condé to reconcile publicly.

===First War of Religion===
====Road to civil war====

The religious direction of Catherine&#x27;s government increasingly isolated it among the grandees of the kingdom, with first Guise and Montmorency alienating themselves from the crown and departing court, and then Navarre entering opposition after the publishing of the landmark Edict of January. In this tense political moment, the duke of Guise, while travelling back to Paris at the request of Navarre to aid in his opposition, oversaw a massacre at Wassy. Continuing on to Paris with his retinue of 1000 men he crossed paths with Condé, accompanied by a retinue of 500, on his way back from a service in the suburbs. Catherine, conscious of the dangers of both being in the city, and angry at Guise for his troops conduct at Wassy, ordered both to vacate the city, but only Condé complied. 

While Catherine appealed to Condé for support he departed to Orléans, allowing Guise to take possession of the young king and regent. There, he seized the city on 2 April, and issued a manifesto in which he denounced the &quot;cruel and horrible carnage wrought at Vassy, in the presence of M. de Guise&quot;. Several days later the Calvinist synod in the city proclaimed him the protector of all churches in France.

====Civil war====
Condé&#x27;s strategy was to seize strategic towns across France, and leverage them for a favourable settlement. To this end local Huguenots across France were encouraged to rise up, and successfully did so in Tours, Rouen, Montpellier and Blois among other cities. Condé failed to seize on the initial momentum however, and was in Orléans in May when Catherine sent François de Scépeaux to negotiate with him, offering the deprival of Guise and Montmorency of their offices and the sole command of the French army by his brother. Condé, confident in his position, rejected these terms, demanding instead full religious freedom for Calvinists. Catherine was unwilling to entertain these terms and withdrew the marshals.

When in June the royal army was at last assembled, it marched on Orléans, seeking to pin Condé&#x27;s forces in the city. Condé, eager to avoid a siege, dispersed his forces into the surrounding country, ending his threat to the city of Paris. With a free hand, the royal army subdued first Bourges, and then upon hearing of Condé&#x27;s negotiations with Elizabeth I in the Treaty of Hampton Court exchanging Le Havre for military support, moved on Rouen to stop the English linking with Condé. While his brother Navarre would be killed at the siege, the city would be subdued. In an attempt to reduce his numerical inferiority, mercenaries were recruited in Germany and brought into France to supplement Condé&#x27;s forces. The royal command tasked Marshal Saint André with intercepting them before a linkup was established, he was however unable to do so and, troops in hand Condé began a march on Paris. 

His drive on the city would be frustrated, and he was brought to battle as he retreated north at the Battle of Dreux. Condé led the Huguenot forces throughout much of the battle, however during a retreat of his cavalry he was captured, and after his forces lost the battle, he would be the Duke of Guise&#x27;s captive. Guise, magnanimous in victory, offered even his bed to the captive prince. However with the death of the duke, assassinated as he tried to subdue Orléans, the crown which had seemed on the precipice of total victory would lose all momentum. Condé would be summoned, along with Montmorency, by Catherine to negotiate a peace. The Edict of Amboise would confirm a degree of toleration, though more restricted than the sweeping Edict of Saint-Germain in 1562. It largely favoured the aristocratic elements of the Huguenot party, with provisions allowing freedom of worship on the estates of the nobility.

===Uneasy peace===
====Removing the English====
With the end of the civil war, the matter of the English occupation of Le Havre and Dieppe became a concern for the crown. Catherine decided that a combined army retaking these cities would help heal the wounds of the previous year. While Coligny and Francois de Coligny d&#x27;Andelot refused to participate against their former ally, Condé joined in the crown&#x27;s effort. The forces under the command of Condé, Charles de Cossé, Count of Brissac and other leaders brought the cities back into submission by August 1563.

====Feud====
Meanwhile a feud had been developing between the Guise and Montmorency family, the former of whom blamed Montmorency&#x27;s nephew Coligny for the assassination of the duke of Guise, the latter of whom had brought his nephew under his protection. Seeking advantage in this quarrel the Cardinal of Lorraine reached out to Condé aiming to build a non-confessional basis of support. This was buoyed by the death of his wife in July 1564, which severed his kinship ties to the Montmorency. The two had a friendly meeting at Soissons where the Cardinal offered him a Guise princess as a new wife. Failing in this, but assured of his goodwill, the cardinal planned to enter Paris in force, his retinue clashing with those of the Montmorency on the streets of Paris in January 1565. Coming out the worse, the Cardinal and the young Henri Guise were forced to flee. Turning to the war of words the Guise proclaimed to Condė and the other princes that they were the protectors of men of true rank, against the upstart house of Montmorency.

====Surprise of Meaux====
Condé would however drift away from the Guise in the coming years, as they abandoned their non-religious approach and began championing the Catholic ultras in pursuit of their vendetta. In particular modifications to the Edict of Amboise which reduced its terms, and a meeting between Catherine and the Duke of Alba were met with disquiet by Condé and Coligny. When a further modification was made to the edict of Amboise in 1567, expanding the ban on Protestantism in Paris to the Ile de France region, at the same time as Alba began marching north to the Netherlands, Condé got into a shouting match with the king, and then decided to withdraw from court. Writing from his estates he protested to Catherine about the hiring of Swiss mercenaries to protect France from Alba&#x27;s troops, seeing them as a tool of Huguenot extermination. Catherine tried to reassure him and invite him back to court but he was uninterested.

Away from the centre of power, the leading Huguenot nobility began plotting what course of action to take, meeting at Coligny&#x27;s chateau to discuss details. Condé, Coligny and the Count of Montgomery were in attendance among others. Eventually it was settled on to kidnap the king and the queen mother at Meaux, and assassinate members of the court who opposed them, specifically the Cardinal of Lorraine. The conspiracy was a better kept secret than that of Amboise, and when they struck on 28 September the court was caught off guard. It was able to recover however and quickly make for Paris; Condé, surprised by the speed of its withdrawal, gave pursuit with only 1/3 of the forces he had intended to assemble. He charged three times, but the phalanxes of Swiss mercenaries were able to repel him and the court made it to Paris.

===Second civil war===
====Civil war====
With their coup a failure, Condé and the other leading plotters decided to besiege Paris, hoping to starve the king out before the crown could assemble the full force of its army against them. Much as with the first civil war, they were aided by subsidiary risings across France, which took the cities of Orléans, Valence and Auxerre among others. Condé negotiated aggressively with those sent out to meet him, demanding a free exercise of religion, the expulsion of Italian financiers and the repeal of all taxes created since the time of Louis XII. The crown rejected these demands, and slowly began building up its forces, and seizing bridges. Misjudging his situation, Condé sent off subsidiary forces to take nearby towns, leaving his encirclement of Paris thin. This done, Montmorency struck out from Paris in November, besting Condé in the bloody battle of Saint-Denis though dying on the field himself. Condé withdrew from Paris, making his way east, conscious that his position was critical, but that the death of Montmorency had bought him some time while the royal army reorganised. Having successfully linked up with mercenaries and other Huguenot armies in the country, he turned back, and decided to besiege Chartres seeing it as a rich target to pay his restless troops. The siege dragged on, in part due to Condé&#x27;s poor placement of the cannons, but before it could conclude, negotiations between the two sides brought a truce on 13 March. Peace was signed at Longjumeau on 23 March 1568.

====Short peace====
The Peace of Longjumeau largely represented a repeat of the terms agreed in Amboise several years prior. It would be uneasy, neither side holding much faith in its survival. The balance at court shifted from the moderates who had negotiated the peace, towards hardliners who desired its overturning. Meanwhile Condé and the Huguenot leadership disregarded the prohibition on foreign alliances, coming to terms with Protestant rebels in the Spanish Netherlands to aid each other against &#x27;wicked counsel&#x27;.

By September Lorraine had a majority on the council for the overturning of the peace, eager to take up Pius V offer of financial assistance in return for a war on heresy. Condé, Coligny and the Huguenot leadership, having been warned of a plan to arrest them by Gaspard de Saulx, sieur de Tavannes fled from the court southwards, making their way to the safe haven of La Rochelle where they took arms to defend themselves. On 28 September the Edict of Saint-Maur revoked Longjumeau and declared Catholicism the only religion of France. On 6 October the Duke of Anjou took the field.

===Third civil war===

Not having the benefit of uprisings in northern cities, Condé and Coligny would reorientate the axis of the third civil war to a defence of the Huguenot heartlands in the south. His forces, and those of Tavannes, circled Loudun in late 1568, seeking to find good ground to attack the other. Eventually the Crown&#x27;s forces broke off to winter, and the Huguenot forces, after trying and failing to seize Saumur likewise settled into camp. In March 1569, hearing reports that Condé intended to lunge south and seize Cognac, Tavannes decided to take advantage, crossing the Charente on the night of 12 March, and coming upon the Huguenot rear. The royal vanguard, under Montpensier, fell upon the Huguenot rear-guard under Condé, and he was unhorsed. Though unarmed and under guard, there would be no gentlemanly capture for him this time and he was executed on the duke of Anjou&#x27;s orders. While the majority of the Huguenot army got away unscathed, Condé&#x27;s corpse would be paraded through Jarnac on the back of a donkey to the jeers of the populace.

==Marriage and children==
Condé married in 1551, to Eléanor de Roucy de Roye (1536–1564), heiress of Charles de Roye. She brought as her dowry the château and small town of Conti-sur-Selles, southwest of Amiens, which would pass to their third son, progenitor of the princes de Conti. They had:

#Henri de Bourbon, Prince of Condé
#Marguerite de Bourbon (b. 8 November 1556, d. 7 October 1558) died young.
#Charles de Bourbon (b. 3 November 1557, d. 1 September 1558) died young.
#François de Bourbon, Prince of Conti b. 19 Aug 1558
#Charles de Bourbon, Cardinal, Archbishop of Rouen, b. 30 Mar 1562
#Louis de Bourbon (b. 30 March 1561, d. 19 October 1563) died young.
#Madeleine de Bourbon (b. 30 March 1562, d. 7 October 1563) died young.
#Catherine de Bourbon b. 18 February 1564, d. 5 May 1564) died young.

On 8 November 1565, a widower, he married Francoise d&#x27;Orleans, Mademoiselle de Longueville, they had:

#Charles de Bourbon, Count of Soissons b. 3 Nov 1566, Nogent le Rotrou
#Louis de Bourbon (b. 7 August 1567, d. 24 March 1569) died young.
#Benjamin de Bourbon (b. 7 September 1569, d. 2 March 1573) died young.

He allegedly fathered a son by his mistress Isabelle de Limeuil, who served as Maid of Honour to Catherine de&#x27; Medici and was a member of her notorious group of female spies known at the French court as the &quot;Flying Squadron&quot;. He vigorously denied paternity much to Isabelle&#x27;s chagrin.His son, Henri, also became a Huguenot general and fought in the later wars of religion.

==Depiction in media==
Louis Condé is played by British actor Sean Teale in the TV show &quot;Reign&quot;. He has an affair with Mary, Queen of Scots and leads a coup against the monarchy.

<text>Kosrae ( ), formerly known as Kusaie or Strong&#x27;s Island, is an island in the Caroline Islands archipelago, and state within the Federated States of Micronesia. It includes the main island of Kosrae and a few nearby islands and islets, the most significant of which (Lelu Island) is inhabited by 1,500 people.

Kosrae&#x27;s land area is , making it the smallest state by area. Sustaining 6,600 people, it is also the smallest by population. Tofol is the state capital, and Mount Finkol is the highest point at .

==History==

Archaeological evidence shows that the island was settled at least by the early years of the first millennium AD. This includes the city of Leluh that existed from about 1250 to 1850 AD, and in its heyday had a population of about 1,500 and covered some . It featured burial pyramids for the nobility.

=== French visitors ===
The French corvette S. M. &quot;La Coquille&quot;, arrived at Okat Harbor on 3 June 1824 and visited until 15 June 1824. Commanded by Louis-Isidore Duperrey, &quot;La Coquille&quot;, on its circumnavigation of the earth (1822–1825) with Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville as second. René-Primevère Lesson also traveled on &quot;Coquille&quot; as a naval doctor and naturalist. &quot;La Coquille&quot; anchored in Kosrae for ten days. During this visit, several crew walked across the island and visited the island of Lelu.

=== Spanish colonization ===
The first recorded sighting by Westerners was by the Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra on 14 September 1529 when trying to return from Tidore to New Spain. The island was under nominal Spanish sovereignty since 1668, but it was not effectively occupied until 1885. By the time of the island&#x27;s first contact with European travelers in 1824, Kosrae had a highly stratified society, typical of the surrounding islands of the time. Its cultural features included matrilineal lineage and clans, with a feudal structure of &quot;nobles&quot; controlling land worked by &quot;commoners&quot; and settlements consisting of small groups of close relatives sharing a single cook house.

The first missionary post was established by Congregationalists in 1852, and virtually the whole island had converted to Christianity by the 1870s. Today, many sects of Christianity are represented on Kosrae, and religion still plays an integral role in culture.

The notorious captain and blackbirder Bully Hayes was shipwrecked on Kosrae on March 15, 1874, when his ship &quot;Leonora&quot; was caught in Utwe harbor during a storm. Bully Hayes made his home in Utwe for seven months, during which he terrorized the local people. In September 1874, HMS &quot;Rosario&quot; (under the command of Captain Dupuis) arrived to investigate the claims against Hayes. He was arrested, but then escaped in a 14-foot boat, built of timber from the wreck of the &quot;Leonora&quot;. His treasure may have been left behind, buried somewhere in the forest, although subsequent diggings have failed to uncover it. The existence of this buried money is part of the myths that surround Hayes.

In 1885, after a dispute between the Spanish Empire and the German Empire, finally resolved under the terms of the Vatican State, the Spanish Navy took effective control of the island.

=== German and Japanese rule (1899–1945) ===
After the Spanish defeat against the United States in the war of 1898, on February the 2nd 1899 Spain sold the Caroline Islands to Germany for 25 million pesetas (17 million German marks). The island came under the control of the Empire of Japan after World War I.

Extensive economic improvements took place during the Japanese South Seas Mandate of 1919 to 1947. The island was practically run by a few missionaries who converted the population; Willard Price, when he visited in the 1930s, reported that the island had no jail, there had been no murders in sixty years, and alcohol and tobacco were unheard of. The island was fortified by the Japanese during World War II, but no battles occurred on Kosrae. The Japanese garrison commanded by Lieutenant-General Yoshikazu Harada consisted of 3,811 IJA men including a company of tanks and 700 IJN men. Tunnel bunkers that have multiple entrances were dug into the island&#x27;s interior peaks and most can still be explored today.

=== United States rule (1945) ===
The island became part of the vast US Naval Base Marshall Islands. In 1945, administration over Kosrae passed to the United States, which ruled the island as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Aid and investment increased from the 1960s.

During the Trust Territory (TTPI) period, Kosrae was initially administered as one of the municipalities of the Ponape (Pohnpei) District, but in 1977 became a separate district. When the Micronesian constitution was defeated in the TTPI districts of Palau and the Marshall Islands, Kosrae joined the remaining districts (Yap, Chuuk and Pohnpei) to form the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Kosrae is the only single-island FSM state (whereby the seven or eight small nearshore islands within the fringing reef, most importantly Lelu Island, are subsumed under the main island), while the other three states are each composed of many islands.

Until 1977, Kosrae was subdivided into districts or villages at the sub-municipality level:
# Lelu (consisting of Lelu Island only)
# Yepen (mainland part of today&#x27;s Lelu municipality, with Tofol, the state capital)
# Tafunsak (roughly corresponding to today&#x27;s Tafunsak municipality)
# Malem (roughly corresponding to today&#x27;s Malem municipality)
# Utwe (roughly corresponding to today&#x27;s Utwe municipality)

By 1980, five municipalities had been created from the former villages or districts:
# Lelu (created from the villages of Lelu district (island) and Yepen district)
# Tafunsak (created from the northeastern part of Tafunsak district)
# Walung (created from the southwestern part of Tafunsak district)
# Malem (created from Malem district)
# Utwe (created from Utwe district)

The number of municipalities has subsequently been reduced to four (by integrating Walung into Tafunsak).

==Geography==

Kosrae, the easternmost of the Caroline Islands, has a population of 6,616 (2010 census). It is located approximately north of the equator, between Guam and the Hawaiian Islands. It has a land area of approximately . Some parts of the island are experiencing coastal erosion.

Kosrae is a volcanic island that is largely unspoiled. It is becoming a destination for scuba divers and hikers. The coral reefs that surround the island are kept in pristine condition through an extensive mooring buoy system, installed and maintained by concerned expat dive operators with the help of the government&#x27;s Marine Resources office. The reefs are largely untouched, and contain miles of hard corals, some said to be thousands of years old.

Kosrae International Airport (IATA code KSA) is located on an artificial island within the fringing reef about from the coast and is connected to the main island by a new bridge that opened to the public in January 2016. It is served by United Airlines (formerly Continental Micronesia) Island Hopper 737-800 flights (thrice a week in each direction) between Hawaii and Guam, stopping at other FSM (Pohnpei and Chuuk) and Marshallese destinations on the way. Nauru Airlines also connect weekly with their fleet of 737-300 jets to Brisbane in Australia and Nadi in Fiji.

There is one significant nearshore island within the fringing reef around Kosrae, which is Lelu Island, and it is only in area, but with a population of around 1,500. It belongs to Lelu municipality, which includes the area around Tofol, the state capital. Other very small, uninhabited islands within the fringing reef are, Yen Yen and Yenasr (also in Lelu municipality), the airport island, Kiul, Mutunyal, Sroansak (Tafunsak municipality), and Srukames (also Tafunsak municipality, Walung part).

=== Municipalities ===

Kosrae State is subdivided into four municipalities.

Of the originally five municipalities of 1980, Walung was subsequently absorbed by Tafunsak.

The capital of the state is Tofol, in Lelu municipality.

==Politics and government==
Kosrae is one of the four federal states of the Federated States of Micronesia, a democratic federation. Each state in the country has the ability to retain a large number of powers within their territory as well as a certain level of sovereignty typical of federal administrative divisions. The chief executive of Kosrae is the governor. Kosrae has a unicameral legislature.

==Economy==

In early times, a system of exchange based on sea shells existed on Kosrae, although little is currently known about how it operated.

Since the 1960s, the Kosraean government has become the main employer on the island, where fishing and traditional farming remain the main source of the islanders&#x27; subsistence. Imports have replaced almost all other native manufactures. The U.S dollar is the official currency used in Kosrae and throughout Micronesia.

The tourism industry to date has mainly centered around scuba diving on the coral reef that rings the island. Surfing, hiking and stand up paddle-boarding through the extensive mangrove system is growing in popularity. The annual Rockhopper running race commenced in 2013 and attracts several dozen competitors from the nearby islands of Kwajalein and Pohnpei.

===Resort sold by raffle===
In July 2016, the Kosrae Nautilus Resort was won in a raffle promoted worldwide. The previous owners, Doug and Sally Beitz, were persuaded by family to conduct the raffle rather than sell the resort, ahead of returning to Australia. The winner, Joshua, is from the state of New South Wales, Australia. Joshua will become owner of a resort, which is free of debt, profitable and has more than 20 years remaining on its lease.
==Education==
The Kosrae Department of Education (DOE) operates six public elementary schools (Tafunsak Elementary School, Malem Elementary School, Utwe Elementary School, Lelu Elementary School, Sansrik Elementary School, Walung Elementary School) and one high school (Kosrae High School). There is also one private school (Kosrae Seventh-day Adventist School).
In July 2011, Kosrae DOE embraced the One Laptop per Child program, distributing 720 &quot;XO&quot; computers to children in its public elementary schools, becoming the first State of Micronesia to do so.

==Languages==
The official language of Kosrae is Kosraean, although the English language may also be used in government discourse. According to the Constitution of Kosrae, English is held to have &quot;equal authority&quot; to Kosraean (although in an instance where the Kosraean and English versions of the Constitution are held to be in irresolvable conflict, the Kosraean version prevails). Spanish language is also studied and spoken in Kosrae.

==Food==
Traditional foods have included breadfruit, coconut, banana, taro, yam, and sugarcane. Breadfruit was the usual staple food, and it was preserved in leaf-lined pits for times of scarcity. Coconuts were reserved for nobles.

Food was a central part of island life, since each settlement consisted of small family groups gathered around a cook house containing at least one earth oven. Soft taro was made into a feast food called &quot;fahfah&quot; by men trained in the elaborate skills needed to prepare it properly, who also prepared suhka (Kava). Brewed from the roots of a mountain plant, Suhka was served to members of the nobility. Fish were harvested mainly from the lagoon using nets.

* Today food for most families consists of imported rice and tinned meats and fish, combined with fresh local fish and root crops. Even today, &quot;fahfah&quot; and pork are considered mainly feast foods. It is thought that the Japanese introduced lime trees to the island, which now bear fruit almost all year round and are considered to be of high quality. A variety of tangerines, which are green when ripe, also abound, and are famous and sought after throughout the surrounding islands. Mountain apples, a tropical tree fruit unrelated to apples (Malus), are grown in many parts of Kosrae as are the delicious strawberry papayas and pineapples. There are many varieties of bananas that are some of the best tasting to be found anywhere, some that must be cooked before eating and others that can be eaten when still greenish (KALIFORNI). A few local farmers are growing and exporting to the Marshall Islands a variety of vegetables such as cucumbers, Chinese cabbage, lettuce, egg plant, squash, cantaloupe and watermelons.

== Land snails of Kosrae ==
There are at least 15 species of land snails reported from Kosrae:

* Assimineidae - &quot;Omphalotropis laevis&quot;

* Diplommatinidae - &quot;Palaina&quot; sp.

* Helicinidae - &quot;Pleurotoma zonata&quot;

<text>Adroa is the supreme god or spirit of the Lugbara people of central Africa.

Adroa is a god they worship, and this aspect of the god was known as &quot;Adroa &#x27;ba o&#x27;bapiri&quot; (&#x27;God the creator of men&#x27;). Adroa was said to have created the first man, Gborogboro, and the first woman, Meme. Gborogboro and Meme were also twins, and they were considered the ancestors of the Lugbara. Adria is also credited with the establishment of social order, by communicating his laws to the tribal ancestors of the Lugbara.

Adroa has two main aspects, Adroa the good (Lugbara: &quot;onyiru&quot;), and Adro the bad (Lugbara: &quot;onzi&quot;). These two dual aspects can be further broken down into different smaller aspects. Adroa, the good aspect, is transcendent and far-removed from mankind. This aspect is sometimes called Adronga or Adrogoa. This aspect includes Adroa in different roles, including &quot;Adroa &#x27;ba o&#x27;dupiri&quot; (&#x27;God the taker away of men&#x27;) as a death deity and &quot;Adroa &#x27;bija&quot; (&#x27;God in the sky&#x27;), a sky deity. Adro, the bad aspect, was described as tall, white and only having half a body, and he travels by jumping around on one leg. He is described as earthly, and dwells on the earth along with mankind, especially in rivers. Adro is usually invisible, but will appear to those who are close to death, and is thus also associated with death. Adro was worshiped through child sacrifice, but since the 1930s a ram was substituted as the victim. Some versions do not consider Adro to be the evil equivalent of Adroa, but as a class of earthly spirits who are &quot;refractions&quot; of the good aspect. Both Adroa and Adro are part of a Lugbara man, as a sign of divine creation. In this aspect, the Adroa is also known as Tali. Women are thought to have no Tali. Upon a man&#x27;s death, the Adro aspect was thought to leave his body, rejoining with Adro in the rivers and becoming Adroanzi. Meanwhile, Tali rejoins Adroa in the sky.
