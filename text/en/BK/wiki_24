<text>is a subordinate unified command of the United States Indo-Pacific Command. It was activated at Fuchū Air Station in Tokyo, Japan, on 1 July 1957 to replace the Far East Command. USFJ is headquartered at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo and is commanded by the Commander, US Forces Japan who is also commander of the Fifth Air Force. Since then, it is the first and only sustained presence of a foreign military on Japanese soil in its history.

USFJ oversees U.S. military personnel, assets, and installations in Japan, including approximately 55,000 active-duty servicemembers and 15 major bases. USFJ supports U.S. responsibilities under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, and its activities are governed by the Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and Japan. The command plays a major role in security-related coordination and dialogue with the Government of Japan and the Japan Self-Defense Forces. 

In July 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that USFJ would be upgraded to a &quot;joint operational headquarters,&quot; a move U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin characterized as &quot;the most significant change to U.S. Forces Japan since its creation&quot;.

==History==
After the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in Asia, the United States Armed Forces assumed administrative authority in Japan. The Imperial Japanese Army and Navy were decommissioned, and the U.S. Armed Forces took control of Japanese military bases until a new government could be formed and positioned to reestablish authority. Allied forces planned to demilitarize Japan, and the new government adopted the Constitution of Japan with a no-armed-force clause in 1947.

After the Korean War began in 1950, Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan, in agreement with the Japanese government, established the paramilitary &quot;National Police Reserve&quot;, which was later developed into the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force. It means the &quot;de facto&quot; remilitarization of postwar Japan.

In 1951, the Treaty of San Francisco was signed by the Allies and Japan, which restored its formal sovereignty. At the same time, the U.S. and Japan signed the Japan-America Security Alliance. By this treaty, USFJ is responsible for the defense of Japan. As part of this agreement, the Japanese government requested that the U.S. military bases remain in Japan and agreed to provide funds and various interests specified in the Status of Forces Agreement. At the expiration of the treaty, the United States and Japan signed the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan. The status of the United States Forces Japan was defined in the U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement. This treaty is still in effect, and it forms the basis of Japan&#x27;s foreign policy.

During the Vietnam War, U.S. military bases in Japan, especially those in the Okinawa Prefecture, were used as important strategic and logistic bases. In 1970, the Koza riot occurred against the U.S. military presence on Okinawa. Strategic bombers were deployed to the bases on Okinawa. Before the 1972 reversion of the island to Japanese administration, it has been speculated but never confirmed that up to 1,200 nuclear weapons may have been stored at Kadena Air Base during the 1960s.

The Japanese government paid ¥217 billion (US$2.0 billion) in 2007 as annual host-nation support called . As of the 2011 budget, such payment was no longer to be referred to as &quot;omoiyari yosan&quot; or &quot;sympathy budget&quot;. Japan compensates 75% ($4.4 billion) of U.S. basing costs.

Immediately after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, 9,720 dependents of United States military and government civilian employees in Japan evacuated the country, mainly to the United States.

The relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to Henoko Bay was resolved in December 2013 with the signing of a landfill agreement by the governor of Okinawa. Under the terms of the U.S.-Japan agreement, 5,000 U.S. Marines were relocated to Guam, and 4,000 Marines were sent to other Pacific locations such as Hawaii or Australia, while around 10,000 Marines were to remain on Okinawa. No timetable for the Marines redeployment was announced, but &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that U.S. Marines would leave Okinawa as soon as suitable facilities on Guam and elsewhere were ready. The relocation move was expected to cost $8.6 billion, including a $3.1 billion cash commitment from Japan for the move to Guam as well as for developing joint training ranges on Guam and on Tinian and Pagan in the Northern Mariana Islands. Certain parcels of land on Okinawa which were leased for use by the American military were supposed to be turned back to Japanese control via a long-term phased return process according to the agreement. These returns have been ongoing since 1972. In October 2020, Marine Corps Base Camp Blaz was activated on Guam. The new base is meant to house Marines relocated from Okinawa, with the final relocation planned for 2025.

In March 2024, media reporting suggested that the organizational remit and status of USFJ would be changed--possibly including the creation of a new joint task force as well as the elevation of the USFJ commander&#x27;s rank--as part of a broader &#x27;upgrading&#x27; of the U.S.-Japan alliance to be announced during the April 2024 visit of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to the United States. As part of that visit, Prime Minister Kishida and U.S. President Joe Biden stated the following in a Joint Leaders&#x27; Statement: Recognizing the speed at which regional security challenges evolve and to ensure our bilateral Alliance structures meet these critical changes, we announce our intention to bilaterally upgrade our respective command and control frameworks to enable seamless integration of operations and capabilities and allow for greater interoperability and planning between U.S. and Japanese forces in peacetime and during contingencies. More effective U.S.-Japan Alliance command and control will strengthen deterrence and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of pressing regional security challenges. We call on our respective defense and foreign ministries to develop this new relationship through the Security Consultative Committee (our security “2+2”).In July 2024, DOD announced that USFJ would be upgraded to a joint operational headquarters. According to one DOD official, this will result in USFJ transitioning from a primarily &quot;administrative command&quot; into an organization with more operational and warfighting responsibilities.

==United States presence debate==
As of May 2022, the stationing of U.S. military personnel at military facilities across Okinawa Island remains a hotly-contested and controversial issue, with the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma often being at the forefront of protests against the presence of U.S. military presence on the island. Okinawa makes up only 0.6% of the nation&#x27;s land area; yet, approximately 62% of United States bases in Japan (exclusive use only) are on Okinawa. Despite an agreement to relocate Marine Corps Air Station Futenma first being reached by the Japanese and U.S. governments in 1996, progress to relocate the base has stalled because of the protests as well as environmental concerns resulting from the construction, operation and relocation of the base.
The U.S. government employs over eight thousand Master Labor Contract/Indirect Hire Agreement workers on Okinawa (per the Labor Management Organization), not including Okinawan contract workers.

There is also debate over the Status of Forces Agreement since it covers a variety of administrative technicalities blending the systems which control how certain situations are handled between the U.S.&#x27;s and Japan&#x27;s legal framework.

===Surveys among Japanese===
In May 2010, a survey of the Okinawan people conducted by the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; and the &quot;Ryūkyū Shimpō&quot;, found that 71% of Okinawans surveyed thought that the presence of Marines on Okinawa was not necessary (15% said it was necessary). When asked what they thought about 62% of exclusive use United States Forces Japan bases being concentrated on Okinawa, 50% said that the number should be reduced and 41% said that the bases should be removed. When asked about the US-Japan security treaty, 55% said it should be a peace treaty, 14% said it should be abolished, and 7% said it should be maintained.

Many of the bases, such as Yokota Air Base, Naval Air Facility Atsugi and Kadena Air Base, are located in the vicinity of residential districts, and local citizens have complained about excessive aircraft noise. The 2014 poll by &quot;Ryūkyū Shimpō&quot; found that 80% of surveyed Okinawans want the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma moved out of the prefecture. On 25 June 2018, Okinawan residents protested against the construction of a new airfield. Activists holding placards and banners went to sea on 70 boats and ships. Protesters urged the Japanese authorities to stop the expansion of the U.S. military presence on the island. Some of the boats went to the guarded construction site, where they came across the Coast Guard patrol vessels. Some activists were arrested for entering a prohibited zone.

On 11 August 2018, about 70,000 protesters gathered at a park in the prefecture capital of Naha to protest the planned relocation of a U.S. military base on the southern Japanese island. Opponents of the relocation said the plan to move Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from a crowded neighborhood to a less populated coastal site would not only affect the environment, but would also go against local wishes to have the base moved from the island entirely.

===Crime===

At the beginning of the occupation of Japan in 1945, many U.S. soldiers participated in the Special Comfort Facility Association. The Japanese government organised the enslavement of 55,000 women to work providing sexual services to U.S. military personnel before the surrender. On discovery of the program, the association was closed by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers.

Between 1972 and 2009, U.S. servicemen committed 5,634 criminal offenses, including 25 murders, 385 burglaries, 25 arsons, 127 rapes, 306 assaults, and 2,827 thefts. Yet, per Marine Corps Installations Pacific data, U.S. service members are convicted of far fewer crimes than local Okinawans. According to the U.S.-Japan Status of Forces Agreement, when U.S. personnel crimes are committed both off-duty and off-base, they should be prosecuted under the Japanese law. In 2008 the National Police Agency released its annual criminal statistics that included activity within the Okinawa prefecture. These findings held American troops were only convicted of 53 crimes per 10,000 U.S. male servicemen, while Okinawan males were convicted of 366 crimes per 10,000. The crime rate found a U.S. serviceman on Okinawa to be 86% less likely to be convicted of a crime by the Japanese government than an Okinawan male.

In more recent history, &quot;crimes ranging from rape to assault and hit-and-run accidents by U.S. military personnel, dependents and civilians have long sparked protests in the prefecture,&quot; stated &quot;The Japan Times&quot;. &quot;A series of horrific crimes by present and former U.S. military personnel stationed on Okinawa has triggered dramatic moves to try to reduce the American presence on the island and in Japan as a whole,&quot; commented &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; in 2009.

In 1995, the abduction and rape of a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl by two U.S. Marines and one U.S. sailor led to demands for the removal of all U.S. military bases in Japan. Other controversial incidents include the Girard incident in 1957, the Michael Brown Okinawa assault incident in 2002, the death of the Kinjo family in 1996, and the hit-and-run death of Yuki Uema in 1998. In February 2008, a 38-year-old U.S. Marine based on Okinawa was arrested in connection with the reported rape of a 14-year-old Okinawan girl. This triggered waves of protest against American military presence on Okinawa and led to tight restrictions on off-base activities. Although the accuser withdrew her charges, the U.S. military court-martialed the suspect and sentenced him to four years in prison under the stricter rules of the military justice system.

U.S. Forces Japan designated 22 February as a &quot;Day of Reflection&quot; for all U.S. military facilities in Japan and established the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Task Force in an effort to prevent similar incidents. In November 2009, Staff Sergeant Clyde &quot;Drew&quot; Gunn, a U.S. Army soldier stationed at Torii Station was involved in a hit-and-run accident of a pedestrian in Yomitan Village on Okinawa. In April 2010, Gunn was charged with failing to render aid and vehicular manslaughter, and he was sentenced to two years and eight months in jail.

In 2013, Seaman Christopher Browning and Petty Officer 3rd Class Skyler Dozierwalker were found guilty by the Naha District Court of raping and robbing a woman in a parking lot in October. Both admitted committing the crime. The case outraged Okinawans and sparked tougher restrictions for all U.S. military personnel in Japan, including a curfew and drinking restrictions.

On 13 May 2013, in a controversial statement, Toru Hashimoto, Mayor of Osaka and co-leader of the Japan Restoration Association said to a senior American military official at the Marine Corps base on Okinawa that &quot;we can&#x27;t control the sexual energy of these brave Marines.&quot; He said that Marines should make more use of the local adult entertainment industry to reduce sexual crimes against local women. Hashimoto also spoke of the necessity of former Japanese Army comfort women and of prostitutes for the U.S. military in other countries such as Korea.

In June 2016, after a civilian worker at the base was charged with murdering a Japanese woman, thousands of people protested on Okinawa. Organizers estimated turnout at 65,000 people, which was the largest anti-base protests on Okinawa since 1995. In November 2017, an intoxicated U.S. service member was arrested following a vehicle crash on Okinawa that killed the other driver.

Although other crimes committed by U.S. servicemen (as well as crimes by Japanese) have occurred in Japan, the Status of Forces Agreement protects servicemen and their employees. Suspects are usually handed over U.S. bases first so Japanese judicial investigations and trials would be severely restricted. Many offenders who have committed sexual assaults and murders have also escaped trials sometimes through transfer, release or honorary discharges when they are in barracks, which is one of the reasons for antipathy from the victims and other local citizens along with the Japanese government&#x27;s indecision.

===Osprey deployment===
In October 2012, twelve MV-22 Ospreys were transferred to Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to replace aging Vietnam-era Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters. In October 2013, an additional 12 Ospreys arrived. Japanese Defense Minister Satoshi Morimoto explained that the Osprey aircraft is safe, adding that two recent accidents were &quot;caused by human factors&quot;. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda also stated that the Japanese government was convinced of the MV-22&#x27;s safety. Various incidents involving V-22 Ospreys have occurred on Okinawa. On 5 April 2018, it was announced that the U.S. Air Force would officially deploy CV-22 Osprey aircraft at its Yokota Air Base.

===Environmental concerns===

Environmental concerns have taken the forefront of the debate over the presence of U.S. military forces on Okinawa. Since the late 1990s, environmental concerns elevated by both local residents as well as larger Okinawan and Japanese environmental action groups and independent activists have often resulted in public protests and demonstrations against the relocation of existing U.S. military bases and the construction of replacement facilities, which have been labelled by some as examples of &quot;modern colonialism&quot;. In particular, lingering environmental concerns over the disruption or destruction of coastal and marine habitats off the shores of Okinawa from construction, relocation and operation of U.S. military bases on Okinawa, has resulted in the protracted and continuing delayal of plans to relocate military facilities, such as Marine Corps Air Station Futenma.

==== Okinawa dugong lawsuit ====
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, initial plans to relocate Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to a new facility located offshore in Henoko Bay were met with strong resistance after sightings of dugong were reported in areas surrounding territory earmarked for the relocated airbase. A critically endangered species, dugong were traditionally fished and hunted throughout Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands. This drew the attention of local, national and international environmental action groups, who raised concerns that land reclamation projects tied to the construction of an offshore airbase in Henoko Bay would result in the destruction of nearby dugong habitats and coastal ecosystems. Despite this, plans were set forth to continue ahead with the relocation of the base, notably, flouting the results of a 1997 referendum where the majority voted to reject a replacement facility.

In opposition to this, in September 2003, a group of Okinawan, Japanese and U.S. environmental organizations filed a lawsuit in San Francisco Federal Court to protest the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. This lawsuit, initially entitled &quot;Okinawa Dugong v. Rumsfeld&quot;, argued that the U.S. Department of Defense failed to consider the impacts that relocating the base would have upon the local dugong population, in turn, violating the U.S. National Historic Preservation Act. This case was closed in January 2008; notably for the plaintiffs, it was ruled that the Department of Defense, by not considering the impacts of the relocated airbase upon the local dugong population, had in fact violated the National Historic Preservation Act, thus delaying the relocation of the base.

==== Water contamination ====
Concerns over water contamination have also exacerbated recent tensions surrounding the presence of U.S. military bases in Okinawa. In June 2020, following the announcement of an earlier leak of firefighting foam from Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in April 2020, a water quality study conducted by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment published findings of elevated contamination levels of PFOS and PFOA at 37 different water sources near U.S. military bases and industrial areas which exceeded provisional national targets. Further incidents concerning the release of the cancer-inducing toxins also occurred in August 2021, further worsening tensions over the presence of &#x27;alarming&#x27; levels of these toxic chemicals.

Subsequent tests around Kadena Air Base, specifically the training site 50 meters west of Dakujaku River, confirmed severe contamination in the water system with PFAS chemicals. These chemicals reach 10s of meters underground while plumes spread for several kilometers from these contaminated training sites flowed into nearby wells and waterways of Dakujaku River and Hija River which contaminated the drinking water of 450,000 residents. These toxic chemicals originate from firefighting foams which contain PFAS and were used at training sites during the 1970s and 80s. However, the U.S. and Japanese governments say that the source of the issue cannot be confirmed.

<text>Kurt Diemberger (born 16 March 1932) is an Austrian mountaineer and author of several books. He is the only living person who has made the first ascents on two mountains over 8,000 metres: of Broad Peak in 1957 and of Dhaulagiri in 1960. In 2013, he won the Piolet d&#x27;Or Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Career==
Diemberger attended university in Vienna, where he obtained two degrees (MBA 1955, M.Ed 1962). Together with Hermann Buhl, he is one of two mountaineers who have successfully made the first ascents on two mountains over 8,000 metres. In 1957, Diemberger was the last person to see Hermann Buhl alive before he fell through a cornice on Chogolisa. This attempt to climb Chogolisa was illegal and subsequently Diemberger was banned from entering Pakistan for an extended period of time.

Diemberger was one of only two survivors in the 1986 K2 Disaster. On 4 August 1986, Diemberger and Julie Tullis reached the summit of K2 very late in the day. Shortly after starting their descent, Tullis fell and dragged Diemberger down with her. They somehow stopped from going over the edge and spent the night above 8,000 metres. They managed to reach Camp IV the next day, where they were forced to share two tents with six other climbers after their tent had collapsed from hurricane force winds. Tullis died later that night, possibly from high altitude cerebral edema, and only one other climber, Austrian Willi Bauer, survived the descent with Diemberger. Both climbers suffered severe frostbite during the descent and had to have amputations.

In 2013, Diemberger won the 5th Piolet d&#x27;Or &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot;.

Diemberger is still active in the mountaineering world and works on film projects with his daughter, Hildegard.

<text>Nusch Éluard (born Maria Benz; 21 June 1906 – 28 November 1946) was a French performer, model and surrealist artist.

Born Maria Benz in Mulhouse (then part of the German Empire), she met Swiss architect and artist Max Bill in the Odeon Café in Zürich; he nicknamed her &quot;Nusch&quot;, a name she would stick to. Their liaison ended after six months when Max Bill&#x27;s plan to marry her in order to avoid her pending extradition from Switzerland was vetoed by his father (to whom he owed a substantial amount of money due to medical expenses following an accident which had forced him to leave the Bauhaus).

==Paris==

Nusch arrived in France as a stage performer, variously described as a small-time actress, a traveling acrobat, and a &quot;hypnotist&#x27;s stooge&quot;. She met Paul Éluard in 1934 working as a model, married him four months later, produced surrealist photomontage and other work, and is the subject of &quot;Facile,&quot; a collection of Éluard&#x27;s poetry published as a photogravure book, illustrated with Man Ray&#x27;s nude photographs of her.

She was also the subject of several cubist portraits and sketches by Pablo Picasso in the late 1930s, and is said to have had an affair with him. Nusch worked for the French Resistance during the Nazi occupation of France during World War II. She died in 1946 in Paris due to a stroke.

<text>The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) investigates civil aircraft accidents and serious incidents within the United Kingdom, its overseas territories and crown dependencies. It is also the Space Accident Investigation Authority (SAIA) for the United Kingdom. The AAIB is a branch of the Department for Transport and is based in the grounds of Farnborough Airport, Hampshire.

==History==
Aviation accident investigation in the United Kingdom started in 1912, when the Royal Aero Club published a report into a fatal accident at Brooklands Aerodrome, Surrey.

The AAIB was established in 1915 as the Accidents Investigation Branch (AIB) of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). 
Captain G B Cockburn was appointed &quot;Inspector of Accidents&quot; for the RFC, reporting directly to the Director General of Military Aeronautics in the War Office.

After the First World War, the Department of Civil Aviation was set up in the Air Ministry and the AIB became part of that department with a remit to investigate both civil and military aviation accidents.

Following the Second World War a Ministry of Civil Aviation was established and in 1946 the AIB was transferred to it, but continued to assist the Royal Air Force with accident investigations – a situation which has continued ever since.

After working under various parent ministries, including the Department of Trade, the AIB moved to the then Department of Transport in 1983 and in November 1987 its name was changed to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB). Latterly, the AAIB has become part of the reorganised Department for Transport (DfT) since 2002. In 2024, the AAIB was awarded the Lennox-Boyd Award by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.

==Organisation==
The AAIB has 64 employees.

These are:
*Chief Inspector of Air Accidents
*Deputy Chief Inspector of Air Accidents
*Six teams of inspectors from all disciplines each led by a principal inspector

AAIB Inspectors fall into one of three categories:

*Operations inspector – must hold a current Airline Transport Pilot Licence with a valid Class I medical certificate. Able to offer appropriate command experience on fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters. Broad-based knowledge of aviation.
*Engineering inspector – must hold an engineering degree and/or be a Chartered Engineer with a minimum of five years&#x27; post qualifications experience. Knowledge and experience of modern aircraft control systems.
*Flight recorder inspector – degree level in electronics/electrical engineering or an aeronautical engineering related subject and/or is a chartered member of a relevant engineering institute with eight years&#x27; experience since qualifying. Knowledge and experience of modern avionics.

There is also a Head of Administration who is supported by two teams, the Inspector Support Unit (ISU) who provide administrative support to the principal inspectors and their teams and the Information Unit (IU), who are the first port of call for accidents being reported.

AAIB administrative staff are part of the Department for Transport (DfT) and are recruited according to civil service guidelines.

==Space Accident Investigation Authority==
In 2021, it was announced that the AAIB had been appointed as the Space Accident Investigation Authority for the United Kingdom, in accordance with the Spaceflight Activities (Investigation of Spaceflight Accidents) Regulations 2021. Independent of the UK Space Agency, it will investigate spaceflight accidents that occur in or over the United Kingdom.

==Investigations==
The AAIB conducts investigations defined under one of two categories; &quot;Accident&quot; or &quot;Serious Incident&quot;. An &quot;Accident&quot; occurs where a person suffers a fatal or serious injury, the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure which adversely affects its performance, or where the aircraft is missing or inaccessible. A &quot;Serious Incident&quot; means an incident where an accident nearly occurred.

The AAIB is responsible for the investigation of civil aircraft accidents and serious incidents within the UK and its overseas territories. These are Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands, Montserrat and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

They are also involved in overseas investigations in other countries when the accident or incident involves a British-registered or British-built aircraft or UK airline, or where their involvement is specifically requested by the investigating host nation.

==Head office==

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has its head office in Farnborough House, a building that is a part of a compound within the boundary of Farnborough Airport, located between Aldershot and Farnborough, within the borough of Rushmoor. The approximately head office site, which houses three large buildings and car park facilities, is in a lightly wooded area south of the main runway of Farnborough Airport. The buildings at the AAIB site include an () L-shaped, two-storey flat roof office building and a hangar. The original buildings were from the 1970s. Lana Design supervised the construction of a two-storey new addition to the main building. It includes offices, acoustic laboratories and a lecture theatre. The addition had a cost of 2.6 million pounds.

The AAIB site is south of the airfield and east of the Puckeridge Ammunition Depot, and it is located near the Basingstoke Canal. Cove Brook, about south of the AAIB head office, runs from the south to the north. The AAIB head office is accessible from Berkshire Copse Road, which dissects through the length of the AAIB head office site. The Borough of Rushmoor stated that the AAIB complex &quot;requires a secluded&quot; and &quot;secure&quot; location due to &quot;the nature of its operation.&quot;

Previously the AAIB head office was in Shell Mex House on the Strand in the City of Westminster, London.

== History ==

=== Establishment ===
After a private normal school closed in San Francisco after only one year, politicians John Swett and Henry B. Janes sought to establish a normal school for San Francisco&#x27;s public school system, and approached George W. Minns to be the principal for the nascent institution The normal school began operations in 1857 and became known as the Minns Evening Normal School. Classes were only held once a week, and only graduated 54 female students across its existence, however the program proved to be enough of a success for increased funding to be approved.

In 1861, after the continued success of the Evening School, a committee was formed to create a report on the merits of fully funding a state normal school and presented its report to the California State Legislator in January 1862. On May 2, 1862, the California State Senate elected to fund a state normal school and to appoint a board of trustees. The California State Normal School was then opened on July 21, 1862.

Despite continued success, with increasing enrollment and funding, the California State Normal School quickly began to hold contention with the San Francisco Board of Education, which poached students and withheld sufficient school facilities. Because of these issues, the Normal School moved sites six times while in San Francisco, citing noise complaints, sanitary concerns, and lack of access to proper facilities and materials.

In 1868, more serious talks of finding a permanent location for the Normal School began, with a general consensus that the school needed to cut ties with the San Francisco Board of Education and move out of San Francisco. After it became public that the Normal School was looking to move for a permanent location, several cities put in bids to home the school, however after the San Jose Railroad Company paid to have the entire student and faculty body tour the city and potential locations for the school, San Jose became the preferred site. The school moved to San Jose in 1871 and was given Washington Square Park at S. 4th and San Carlos Streets, where the campus remains to this day.
The first building on Washington Square was opened in 1871 and fully completed in 1876, however in 1880 the building was destroyed in a fire. After its destruction, Principal Charles H. Allen journeyed to Sacramento to request the California State Legislator for emergency funds for a new building. This caused significant debate in the senate about the effectiveness of the school and if it would be better served elsewhere. The California State Senate voted to move the school to Los Angeles, but was ultimately kept in San Jose after objections by the California State Assembly. The legislature ultimately settled to give partial emergency funds to the school for the construction of a new building, which finished construction in 1881.As a part of the construction of the new building, a large bell was forged to commemorate the school. The bell cost $1,200 , and was inscribed with the words &quot;California State Normal School, A.D. 1881,&quot; and would sound on special occasions until 1946 when the college obtained new chimes. The original bell appears on the SJSU campus to this day and is still associated with various student traditions and rituals.

Immediately after the failed attempt to move State Normal School to Los Angeles, California State Senator J.P. West sponsored a bill to create a &quot;Branch State Normal School&quot; in Los Angeles. The bill was passed by both houses, and opened in August 1882. The southern branch campus remained under administrative control of the San Jose campus until 1887. In 1919, the school became the southern branch of the University of California, and later became the University of California, Los Angeles.

=== 20th Century ===
In 1921, the California State Normal School changed its name to the State Teachers College at San Jose.

In 1922, the State Teachers College at San Jose adopted the Spartans as the school&#x27;s official mascot and nickname. Mascots and nicknames prior to 1922 included the Daniels, the Teachers, the Pedagogues, the Normals and the Normalites.

In 1930, the Justice Studies Department was founded as a two-year police science degree program. It holds the distinction of offering the first policing degree in the United States. A stone monument and plaque are displayed close to the site of the original police school near Tower Hall.

In 1935, the State Teachers Colleges became the California State Colleges, and the school&#x27;s name was changed again, this time to San Jose State College.

In 1942, the old gym (now named Yoshihiro Uchida Hall, after SJSU judo coach Yosh Uchida) was used to register and collect Japanese Americans before sending them to internment camps. Uchida&#x27;s own family members were interred at some of these camps.

In 1963, in an effort to save Tower Hall from demolition, SJSU students and alumni organized testimonials before the State College Board of Trustees, sent telegrams and provided signed petitions. As a result of those efforts, the tower, a principal campus landmark and SJSU icon, was refurbished and reopened in 1966. The tower was again renovated and restored in 2007. Tower Hall is registered with the California Office of Historic Preservation.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, San Jose State College witnessed a rise in political activism and civic awareness among its student body, including major student protests against the Vietnam War. One of the largest campus protests took place in 1967 when Dow Chemical Company — a major manufacturer of napalm used in the war — came to campus to conduct job recruiting. An estimated 3,000 students and bystanders surrounded the 7th Street administration building, and more than 200 students and teachers lay down on the ground in front of the recruiters.

In 1972, upon meeting criteria established by the board of trustees and the Coordinating Council for Higher Education, SJSC was granted university status, and the name was changed to California State University, San Jose. However, in 1974, the California legislature voted to change the school&#x27;s name to San José State University.

In 1982, the English department began sponsoring the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest.

In 1985, the CADRE Laboratory for New Media was established. It is believed to be the second oldest media lab of its kind in the United States.

In 1999, San Jose State and the City of San Jose agreed to combine their main libraries to form a joint city-university library located on campus, the first known collaboration of this type in the United States. The combined library faced opposition, with critics stating the two libraries have very different objectives and that the project would be too expensive. Despite opposition, the $177 million project proceeded, and the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library opened on time and on budget in 2003. The library has won several national awards since its initial opening.

=== 21st Century ===
During its 2006–07 fiscal year, SJSU received a record $50+ million in private gifts and $84 million in capital campaign contributions.

In 2008, SJSU received a CASE WealthEngine Award in recognition of raising over $100 million. SJSU was one of approximately 50 institutions nationwide honored by CASE in 2008 for overall performance in educational fundraising.

In October 2010, SJSU President Don Kassing publicly launched SJSU&#x27;s first-ever comprehensive capital fundraising campaign dubbed &quot;Acceleration: the Campaign for San Jose State University.&quot; The original goal of the multi-year campaign was to raise $150 million but was later increased to $200 million because of the rapid success of the campaign. The campaign would eventually exceed its goal one year earlier than anticipated, raising more than $208 million by 2013.

In 2012, the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, awarded SJSU $73.3 million to participate in the development of systems for improving the safety and efficiency of air and space travel. NASA scientists, SJSU faculty and graduate students worked collaboratively on this effort. The grant was the largest federal award in SJSU history.
=== University principals and presidents ===
Thirty-two people have led San Jose State since its founding including 8 principals, 15 presidents, 5 acting presidents, and 4 interim presidents.

== Campus ==

The SJSU main campus comprises approximately 55 buildings situated on a rectangular, area in downtown San Jose. The campus is bordered by San Fernando Street to the north, San Salvador Street to the south, South 4th Street to the west, and South 10th Street to the east. The south campus, which is home to many of the school&#x27;s athletics facilities, is located approximately south of the main campus on South 7th Street.

California State Normal School did not receive a permanent home until it moved from San Francisco to San Jose in 1871. The original California State Normal School campus in San Jose consisted of several rectangular, wooden buildings with a central grass quadrangle. The wooden buildings were destroyed by fire in 1880 and were replaced by interconnected stone and masonry structures of roughly the same configuration in 1881.

These buildings were declared unsafe following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and were being torn down when an aftershock of the magnitude that was predicted to destroy the buildings occurred and no damage was observed. Accordingly, demolition was stopped, and the portions of the buildings still standing were subsequently transformed into four halls: Tower Hall, Morris Dailey Auditorium, Washington Square Hall and Dwight Bentel Hall. These four structures remain standing to this day and are the oldest buildings on campus.

Beginning in the fall of 1994, the on-campus segments of San Carlos Street, 7th Street and 9th Street were closed to automobile traffic and converted to pedestrian walkways and green belts within the campus. San Carlos Street was renamed Paseo de San Carlos, 7th Street became Paseo de César Chávez, and 9th Street is now called the Ninth Street Plaza. The project was completed in 1996.

Completed in 1999, the Business Classroom Project was a $16 million renovation of the James F. Boccardo Business Education Center.

Completed in 1999, the $1.5 million Heritage Gateway project was unveiled. The privately funded project featured construction of eight oversized gateways around the main campus perimeter.

In the fall of 2000, the SJSU Police Department, which is part of the larger California State University Police Department, opened a new on-campus, multi-level facility on 7th Street.

The $177 million Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library, which opened its doors on August 1, 2003, won the Library Journal&#x27;s 2004 Library of the Year award, the publication&#x27;s highest honor. The King Library represents the first collaboration of its kind between a university and a major U.S. city. The library is eight stories high, has of floor space, and houses approximately 1.3 million volumes. San Jose&#x27;s first public library occupied the same site from 1901 to 1936, and SJSU&#x27;s Wahlquist Library occupied the site from 1961 to 2000.

In 2007, a $2 million renovation of Tower Hall was completed. Tower Hall is among the oldest and most recognizable buildings on campus. It was registered as an official California Historical Landmark in 1949. The building was rededicated in 1910 after numerous campus structures were either destroyed or heavily damaged in the 1906 earthquake. Tower Hall, Morris Dailey Auditorium, Washington Square Hall and Dwight Bentel Hall are the four oldest buildings on campus.

The Diaz Compean Student Union is a four-story, stand-alone facility that features a food court, the Spartan Bookstore, a multi-level study area, ballrooms, a bowling alley, music room and large game room. In September 2010, a $90 million expansion and renovation of the student union commenced. The project added approximately including construction of new ballrooms, food court, theater, meeting rooms and student program spaces. The expansion phase of the project was completed in June 2014. The renovation phase of the project was completed in August 2015.

Construction of a new, three-story, on-campus health center at 7th Street and Paseo de San Carlos was completed in March 2015. The building houses the Student Health Center, Student Affairs office, Counseling Services and Wellness Center. The project was completed at a cost of over $36 million.

In August 2015, a $55 million renovation of the Spartan Complex was completed. The Spartan Complex houses open recreation spaces, gymnasiums, an indoor aquatics center, the kinesiology department, weight rooms, locker rooms, dance and judo studios, and other classroom space. The primary project objectives were to expand existing structures, upgrade the structures to make them compliant with current building codes, correct ADA deficiencies, remove hazardous materials and correct fire safety deficiencies.

=== Residence halls ===

The SJSU on-campus housing community comprises seven residence halls, which can accommodate a combined total of 4,458 students. When the third phase of the Campus Village is completed, SJSU&#x27;s total on-campus student housing capacity should increase from 4,458 to 4,928. The projected total cost for this project is approximately $334 million.

In January 2023, the California State University Board of Trustees approved a public-private partnership between SJSU and local investors that will allow the former Alfred E. Alquist state office building site to be transformed into new housing for SJSU faculty, staff, and graduate students. Located one block west of the SJSU main campus, the 1.6-acre (0.65 ha) parcel will be the site of approximately 1,000 new housing rental units. Up to half of those units will be reserved for graduate students. The new housing development will comprise one or more high-rise structures up to tall. The estimated total cost of the project is $750 million. The project&#x27;s design phase is projected to be completed by early 2024. Construction is projected to begin in late 2024 and be completed in 2027.

=== Undergraduate admissions ===
Admission to SJSU is based on a combination of the applicant&#x27;s high school cumulative grade point average (GPA) and standardized test scores. These factors are used to determine the applicant&#x27;s California State University (CSU) eligibility index. More specifically, the eligibility index is a weighted combination of the applicant&#x27;s high school grade point average during the final three years of high school and either the SAT or ACT score.

The CSU eligibility index is calculated by using either the SAT or ACT as follows: &quot;(Sum of SAT scores in mathematics and critical reading) + (800 x high school GPA) or (10 x ACT composite score without the writing score) + (200 x high school GPA).&quot;

In fall 2022, a total of 34,783 first-time, first-year (freshmen) applications were submitted, with 26,083 applicants accepted (75.0%) and 4,036 enrolling (15.5% of those accepted).

Smith and Carlos are perhaps best remembered for giving the raised fist salute from the medalist&#x27;s podium during the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. In 2005, a monument of the protest was built on Tower Lawn, designed by artist Rigo 23 and titled &quot;Victory Salute&quot;, the monument encourages passerby&#x27;s to recreate the historic moment. The track and field program was canceled in 1988 after a series of budget cuts and Title IX related decisions decimated the program. The program was reinstated in 2016.

After an 11-2 finish in 2012, SJSU&#x27;s football team achieved its first-ever BCS ranking and first national ranking since 1990. SJSU was ranked No. 21 in both the 2012 post-season Associated Press Poll and the USA Today Coaches&#x27; Poll.

The Spartan football team had another breakout season in 2020, cracking the AP Poll top-25 for the first time since 2012 and appearing in the College Football Playoff ranking at No. 24. The team also won its first conference championship title since 1991. The Spartans finished the 2020 season 7-1 and ranked No. 24 in the AP Poll.

=== Club sports ===
In addition to its various NCAA Division I sports programs, San José State University has a very active club sports community consisting of approximately 25 sports and 50 teams. Many of the club sports teams are run and organized by students, although some of the more established teams employ full-time paid coaches and enjoy strong alumni support. The list of club sports active at SJSU includes:

=== Traditions ===
The old campus bell, which was originally located in a small tower to the right of the main entrance to the campus, was purchased and installed in 1881 at a cost of $1,217. The bell chimed each morning at eight o&#x27;clock until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake stilled its voice. When Tower Hall was constructed in 1909, it was specially designed to house the old bell. The bell rang on special occasions until the college obtained new carillon chimes in 1946. The old bell is displayed to this day on the Washington Square quad near Tower Hall.

In 1922, the State Teachers College at San Jose adopted the Spartans as the school&#x27;s official mascot and nickname. Mascots and nicknames prior to 1922 included the Daniels, the Teachers, the Pedagogues, the Normals and the Normalites.

In 1925, students debated whether to change the school colors from gold and white to purple and white. Tradition won out, and the students decided to keep the original colors, gold and white. At some point prior to 1929 when the SJSU alma mater was officially adopted, blue was added as an official school color alongside gold and white.

According to information published in the old SJSU La Torre yearbook, Spardi Gras was first held in 1929 on George Washington&#x27;s birthday. Spardi Gras was described in the 1929 edition of La Torre as &quot;[an] event which met with unprecedented participance by the entire student body ... a gala occasion of play, sport, and merrymaking later authorized by the Executive Board as an annual event because of its great success.&quot; Spardi Gras was last mentioned in La Torre in 1960.

Another longstanding event at SJSU was &quot;Spartan Revelries.&quot; According to information published in the 1960 edition of La Torre, Spartan Revelries was an &quot;all-student college musical event written, produced and presented entirely by students.&quot; It&#x27;s unclear when Spartan Revelries began, but some believe it started in 1929 as a grand finale to Spardi Gras. In 1949, an official Revelries board was established to carry out the business and management of each year&#x27;s show, which had grown into a major annual event requiring the efforts of many students and several months of preparation.

Sparta Camp was an annual event held between 1953 and 1965. The retreat was hosted by the Associated Students and was held every spring at the Asilomar State Beach. The event was open to all students with an interest in student government, and students had to apply to go. Participants attended workshops and discussion groups on leadership. A similar event known as Freshman Camp was also held at Asilomar every September to help new students get oriented to the campus and the &quot;Spirit of Sparta.&quot;

The chimes heard on the SJSU campus each quarter hour are Westminster chimes, which were a gift from the class of 1947. They ring the same tones as the famous Big Ben chimes in England. Students and alumni show their Spartan pride every Thursday by wearing Spartan blue and gold. Each year during homecoming week, SJSU hosts a series of events leading up to the homecoming football game at CEFCU Stadium. Events include the Campus MovieFest Finale and Fire on the Fountain festival.

===Alma mater===
&quot;Hail! Spartans, Hail!&quot; is the university&#x27;s official alma mater. The lyrics were written by Gerald Erwin, a 1933 graduate. Erwin was a music major who also served as the student director of the glee club. The song was officially adopted as the school hymn on February 25, 1929. Whenever the SJSU Alma Mater is played, students are asked to stand, remove their hats and sing along.

The university also has a fight song, which is typically played and/or sung at the end of football games and other athletic events including pep rallies.
== Alumni ==
About 60% of San Jose State&#x27;s 275,000 living alumni of record reside in the San Francisco Bay Area. The other 40% are scattered around the globe, with concentrations in Southern California, Seattle, Portland, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and New York City.

SJSU is consistently listed among the leading suppliers of undergraduate and graduate alumni to Silicon Valley science and technology firms. In 2015, San José State University was listed as the top feeder school for Apple Inc., which employed over 1,000 SJSU graduates at the time. SJSU ranked 9th on the list of top feeder schools for Facebook.

Some of the more notable SJSU alumni in science and engineering include Ray Dolby, founder of Dolby sound systems; Dian Fossey, primatologist and gorilla researcher; Gordon Moore, founder of Intel Corporation and creator of &quot;Moore&#x27;s law;&quot; and Ed Oates, co-founder of Oracle.

Nearly 200 former SJSU students and graduates have founded, co-founded, served or serve as senior executives or officers of public and private companies reporting annual sales between $40 million and $26 billion. This list includes former Intel Corporation CEO, Brian Krzanich, and current Crown Worldwide Group CEO, billionaire James E. Thompson.

<text>The Wooton desk is a variation of the fall front desk, native to Indianapolis, Indiana, and produced from 1874 to 1890.

==History==
Indianapolis, Indiana entrepreneur William S. Wooton obtained patents for his desk design in 1874. The desk was introduced at a time when the small business owner was seeing an increase in daily correspondence. With this increase in paperwork came the need for adequate storage and retrieval of files. An early advertisement for the Wooten desk described the model as follows:

&quot;Everything that ingenuity can suggest or devise to facilitate desk labor, has been introduced in our secretary...Its comprehensive character is such that ample accommodations are afforded for the requirements of the most voluminous business. Every facility is furnished for a thorough and systematic classification of books, papers, memorandums, etc. Through its aid the usual fret and worry of office work is converted into a positive pleasure. It is a miniature counting-house, with a combination of such conveniences as are found best adapted for the manipulation of office work, and these all under one lock and key.&quot;

Soon after the Wooten desk‘s introduction the reservoir-based fountain pen and typewriter became popular and produced greater quantities of office documents than its pigeon hole style storage system could accommodate. Production ceased in 1890.

==Design==

Wooton desks were not the costliest desks in series production, but they did utilize the most drawers, nooks, and crannies of all the designs available. Only a few examples of the cupboard desk had more divisions, but they were of a very utilitarian style and were often produced by the families or communities which used them, such as the Shakers. The armoire desk is the closest modern relative to the Wooton desk in its size and form. However, the armoire desk is even larger than the Wooton, and despite the use of rich veneers by some makers, is a much more practical piece of furniture.

The Wooton secretary desk rests on a four-legged quadruped support equipped with casters. The main body of the desk is filled with dozens of small drawers and nooks for papers and small objects.

As in a &quot;secrétaire à abattant,&quot; or fall front desk, the main working surface or desktop is hinged and lifted completely from the horizontal to the vertical in order to lock up the desk, forcing the user to gather up and store all papers and implements beforehand. Unlike the secrétaire à abattant however, the Wooton desktop hides only a few of the small drawers and nooks. The real lockup is done by closing two massive hinged panels which are as deep as the desk and filled with drawers and nooks of all sizes.

Wooton desks in good condition are sometimes sold in auctions for the same price as a top-of-the-line luxury automobile.

<doc id="378512" wikidata="Q968572" url="?curid=378512" title="Rocket from the Tombs">
<text>Rocket from the Tombs (or RFTT) is an American rock band originally active from mid-1974 to mid-1975 in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The band featured David Thomas and was reconstituted several times with various line-ups starting in 2003.

Heralded as an important protopunk group, they were little known during the band&#x27;s original lifetime, although various members later achieved renown in Pere Ubu and the Dead Boys. Billy Bob Hargus wrote, however, that &quot;The sound of the Rockets is much more ferocious than Ubu or the Dead Boys.&quot;

== Band history ==
The band played their first show June 16, 1974 at the Viking Saloon in downtown Cleveland. The original line-up was David Thomas (then known as &quot;Crocus Behemoth&quot; (vocals, bass), Kim Zonneville (bass, vocals), Glenn &quot;Thunderhand&quot; Hach (guitar, vocals) and Tom &quot;Foolery&quot; Clements (drums).

There was some fluctuation of the group&#x27;s personnel, but what has come to be known as the &quot;classic&quot; lineup included, Thomas, Peter Laughner, Craig Willis Bell (a.k.a. Darwin Layne), Gene O&#x27;Connor (a.k.a. Cheetah Chrome), and Johnny Madansky (a.k.a. &quot;Johnny Blitz&quot;).

When RFTT disbanded, the personnel split and formed three different musical groups:
*O&#x27;Connor and Madansky joined with singer Stiv Bators (who made a guest appearance on-stage at the last RFTT show) to form Frankenstein, which later morphed into the Dead Boys, a more straightforward punk rock group.
*Laughner and Thomas went on to form the more experimental Pere Ubu with bassist Tim Wright (RFTT&#x27;s soundman). Laughner died in 1977, of acute pancreatitis brought on by years of drinking and drug use.
*Bell moved to Connecticut and started a band called Saucers.

All three bands used songs first written or performed by Rocket From The Tombs as parts of their repertoires: the Dead Boys were known for &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Fun,&quot; &quot;What Love Is,&quot; &quot;Down in Flames,&quot; &quot;Caught With the Meat in Your Mouth&quot; (done by RFTT as &quot;I&#x27;m Never Gonna Kill Myself Again&quot;) and &quot;Sonic Reducer&quot;; Pere Ubu went on to reinterpret &quot;Final Solution,&quot; &quot;Life Stinks&quot; and &quot;30 Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;; Saucers played &quot;Muckraker”, and “Frustration”.

Rocket From The Tombs never recorded an album in their initial timespan, but various live recordings and demos circulated occasionally as bootlegs. Most of these were collected on a single CD by Smog Veil records, and titled &quot;The Day the Earth Met the Rocket from the Tombs&quot; (2002).

San Diego punk band Rocket from the Crypt chose their name after being inspired by hearing Rocket from the Tombs bootleg recordings.

== Reunion ==
The Smog Veil Records CD rekindled interest in Rocket From The Tombs, and they reformed in 2003 with original members Thomas, Chrome, and Bell, joined by Richard Lloyd (guitar), and Steve Mehlman (drums). Some claim that decades earlier, when Lloyd briefly quit the New York-based band Television, Laughner was seriously considered as his replacement. However, on his website richardlloyd.com, Richard Lloyd asserts that Laughner &quot;was never even close to being in Television, unless I was way out of town for a month, and I don&#x27;t think so.&quot;

On June 10, 2003 they played their first live radio concert since the 1970s (when two shows live from the Agora club aired on WMMS) on Brian Turner&#x27;s program on WFMU.

In 2004, Smog Veil and Morphius released &quot;Rocket Redux&quot;, consisting of Rocket From The Tombs originals performed in studio by the 2003 lineup. It received mostly positive reviews; one critic declared that &quot;Redux&quot; &quot;never sounds like a complacent reunion record, and in a way, I suppose it&#x27;s not really a reunion record in the first place so much as it&#x27;s a debut album, played with all the hunger and fire of a band eager to make their mark on the world.&quot;

In 2006, Thomas announced that the band had again reunited, this time to work on new material. The band toured the United States in the summer of 2006 and debuted some new songs, but no further activity occurred until 2009 when the band contributed a song to the Mark Mulcahy tribute album &quot;Ciao My Shining Star: The Songs of Mark Mulcahy&quot;. An album of new material, &quot;Barfly&quot; was released on September 13, 2011 with a tour scheduled to begin in November 2011. However, Richard Lloyd was replaced in the band prior to the tour&#x27;s launch, and Cheetah Chrome announced his departure from Rocket From the Tombs on December 30, 2011, leaving David Thomas and Craig Willis Bell as the only remaining original members.

In November 2015, the band released &quot;Black Record&quot;.

<text>Cerebral edema is excess accumulation of fluid (edema) in the intracellular or extracellular spaces of the brain. This typically causes impaired nerve function, increased pressure within the skull, and can eventually lead to direct compression of brain tissue and blood vessels. Symptoms vary based on the location and extent of edema and generally include headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures, drowsiness, visual disturbances, dizziness, and in severe cases, death.
Cerebral edema is commonly seen in a variety of brain injuries including ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, subdural, epidural, or intracerebral hematoma, hydrocephalus, brain cancer, brain infections, low blood sodium levels, high altitude, and acute liver failure. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and physical examination findings and confirmed by serial neuroimaging (computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging).
The treatment of cerebral edema depends on the cause and includes monitoring of the person&#x27;s airway and intracranial pressure, proper positioning, controlled hyperventilation, medications, fluid management, steroids. Extensive cerebral edema can also be treated surgically with a decompressive craniectomy. Cerebral edema is a major cause of brain damage and contributes significantly to the mortality of ischemic strokes and traumatic brain injuries.
As cerebral edema is present with many common cerebral pathologies, the epidemiology of the disease is not easily defined. The incidence of this disorder should be considered in terms of its potential causes and is present in most cases of traumatic brain injury, central nervous system tumors, brain ischemia, and intracerebral hemorrhage. For example, malignant brain edema was present in roughly 31% of people with ischemic strokes within 30 days after onset.

== Signs and symptoms ==

The extent and severity of the symptoms of cerebral edema depend on the exact etiology but are generally related to an acute increase of the pressure within the skull. As the skull is a fixed and inelastic space, the accumulation of cerebral edema can displace and compress vital brain tissue, cerebral spinal fluid, and blood vessels, according to the Monro–Kellie doctrine.

Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a life-threatening surgical emergency marked by symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, decreased consciousness. Symptoms are frequently accompanied by visual disturbances such as gaze paresis, reduced vision, and dizziness. Increased pressures within the skull can cause a compensatory elevation of blood pressure to maintain cerebral blood flow, which, when associated with irregular breathing and a decreased heart rate, is called the Cushing reflex. The Cushing reflex often indicates compression of the brain on brain tissue and blood vessels, leading to decreased blood flow to the brain and eventually death.

== Causes ==
Cerebral edema is frequently encountered in acute brain injuries from a variety of origins, including but not limited to:

* Traumatic brain injury
* Stroke
* Tumors
* Infections (such as a brain abscess or meningitis)
* Hepatic encephalopathy
* Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome
* Radiation-induced brain edema
* Post-surgical changes
* Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities associated with edema (ARIA-E)
* Hyponatremia
* High-altitude cerebral edema

=== Risk factors ===
Cerebral edema is present with many common cerebral pathologies and risk factors for development of cerebral edema will depend on the cause. The following were reliable predictors for development of early cerebral edema in ischemic strokes.

* Younger age
* Higher severity of symptoms on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
* Signs of current ischemia on clinical exam
* Decreased level of consciousness
* Hyper dense artery sign and larger affected area on CT imaging
* Higher blood glucose

== Classification ==
Cerebral edema has been traditional classified into two major sub-types: cytotoxic and vasogenic cerebral edema. This simple classification helps guide medical decision making and treatment of patients affected with cerebral edema. There are, however, several more differentiated types including but not limited to interstitial, osmotic, hydrostatic, and high altitude associated edema. Within one affected person, many individual sub-types can be present simultaneously.

The following individual sub-types have been identified:

=== Cytotoxic ===
In general, cytotoxic edema is linked to cell death in the brain through excessive cellular swelling. During cerebral ischemia for example, the blood–brain barrier remains intact but decreased blood flow and glucose supply leads to a disruption in cellular metabolism and creation of energy sources, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Exhaustion of energy sources impairs functioning of the sodium and potassium pump in the cell membrane, leading to cellular retention of sodium ions. Accumulation of sodium in the cell causes a rapid uptake of water through osmosis, with subsequent swelling of the cells. The ultimate consequence of cytotoxic edema is the oncotic death of neurons. The swelling of the individual cells of the brain is the main distinguishing characteristic of cytotoxic edema, as opposed to vasogenic edema, wherein the influx of fluid is typically seen in the interstitial space rather than within the cells themselves. Researchers have proposed that &quot;cellular edema&quot; may be more preferable to the term &quot;cytotoxic edema&quot; given the distinct swelling and lack of consistent &quot;toxic&quot; substance involved.

There are several clinical conditions in which cytotoxic edema is present:

* Commonly caused by traumatic brain injuries, intracerebral hemorrhage, and the early phase of ischemic stroke.
* Also seen in acute liver failure where toxic waste, most notably ammonia, accumulates in the blood stream and crosses the blood–brain barrier. Hyperammonemia in central nervous system (CNS) cells causes oxidative stress and mitochrondrial dysfunction, leading to astrocytic cell swelling. Additionally, ammonia is converted to glutamine in CNS cells which acts as an osmolyte and draws further water into the cell through osmosis. Cerebral edema occurs most commonly in conjunction with a rapid rise in ammonia levels.
* Toxic exposures to methionine sulfoximine, cuprizone, isoniazid, triethyltin, hexachlorophene, and hydrogen cyanide have been associated with cytotoxic edema and swelling of astrocytic cells.
* Hypoxia, anoxia can lead to cytotoxic edema through several mechanisms

===Vasogenic===
Extracellular brain edema, or vasogenic edema, is caused by an increase in the permeability of the blood–brain barrier. The blood–brain barrier consists of astrocytes and pericytes joined with adhesion proteins producing tight junctions. Return of blood flow to these cells after an ischemic stroke can cause excitotoxicity and oxidative stress leading to dysfunction of the endothelial cells and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. The breakdown of the tight endothelial junctions that make up the blood–brain barrier causes extravasation of fluid, ions, and plasma proteins, such as albumin, into the brain parenchyma. Accumulation of extracellular fluid increases brain volume and then intracranial pressure causing the symptoms of cerebral edema.

There are several clinical conditions in which vasogenic edema is present:

* CNS tumors, like glioblastoma and meningioma
* Infections like meningitis, abscess, and encephalitis
* Inflammatory central nervous system disease such as multiple sclerosis
* Brain hemorrhage
* Traumatic brain injuries can lead to increased intracranial pressure, local damage, reduced cerebral blood flow, and focal ischemia secondary to vasogenic edema.
* Late stage of ischemic stroke after rapid recovery from cytotoxic edema
* Hypertensive encephalopathy
* Radiation injury

=== Ionic (Osmotic) ===
In ionic edema, the solute concentration (osmolality) of the brain exceeds that of the plasma and the abnormal pressure gradient leads to accumulation of water intake into the brain parenchyma through the process of osmosis. The blood-brain barrier is intact and maintains the osmotic gradient.

The solute concentration of the blood plasma can be diluted by several mechanisms:

* Improper administration of intravenous fluids, isotonic or hypotonic.
* Excessive water intake, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
* Rapid reduction of blood glucose in diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
* Hemodialysis has been associated with ionic edema and cellular swelling.
* Cerebral edema is a potentially life-threatening complication of severely decreased sodium ion concentration in the blood (hyponatremia).

Ionic brain edema can also occur around the sites of brain hemorrhages, infarcts, or contusions due to a local plasma osmolality pressure gradient when compared to the high osmolality in the affected tissue.

=== Interstitial (hydrocephalic) ===
Interstitial edema can be best characterized by in noncomunnicating hydrocephalus where there is an obstruction to the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid within the ventricular system. The obstruction creates a rise in the intraventricular pressure and causes CSF to flow through the wall of the ventricles into the extracellular fluid within brain. The fluid has roughly the same composition of CSF.

Other causes of interstitial edema include but are not limited to communicating hydrocephalus, and normal pressure hydrocephalus.

=== Hydrostatic ===
Hydrostatic extracellular brain edema is typically caused by severe arterial hypertension. A difference in the hydrostatic pressure within the arterial system relative to the endothelial cells allows ultrafiltration of water, ions, and low molecular weight substances (such as glucose, small amino acids) into the brain parenchyma. The blood-brain barrier is intact usually and the extent of the edema depends on the arterial pressure. The regulatory processes of the brain circulation can function up to systolic arterial pressures of 150 mm Hg and will have impaired function at higher blood pressures.

=== Combined types of cerebral edema ===
Cytotoxic, osmotic, and vasogenic edema exist on a continuum. The mechanism of the cause of cerebral edema can often overlap between these types. In most instances, cytotoxic and vasogenic edema occur together. When the two edema types evolve simultaneously, the damage of one type reaches a limit and will bring about the other type of injury. For example, when cytotoxic edema occurs in the endothelial cells of the blood–brain barrier, oncotic cell death contributes to loss of integrity of the blood–brain barrier and promotes the progression to vasogenic edema. When brain edema types are combined, there is typically a primary form and the edema type and context of the cause must be determined in order to start appropriate medical or surgical therapy. The use of specific MRI techniques has allowed for some differentiation between the mechanisms. 

=== Subtypes ===

==== High-altitude cerebral edema ====
If not properly acclimatized to high altitude, a person may be negatively affected by the lower oxygen concentration available. These hypoxia-related illnesses include acute mountain sickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema, and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE). High-altitude cerebral edema is a severe and sometimes fatal form of altitude sickness that results from capillary fluid leakage due to the effects of hypoxia on the mitochondria-rich endothelial cells of the blood–brain barrier. The edema can be characterized by vasogenic cerebral edema with symptoms of impaired consciousness and truncal ataxia.

Altitude-related illnesses can be prevented most effectively with slow ascent to high altitudes, an average ascent of 300 to 500 meters per day is recommended. Pharmacological prophylaxis with acetazolamide or corticosteroids can be used in non pre-acclimatized individuals. If symptoms of high-altitude cerebral edema do not resolve or worsen, immediate descent is necessary, and symptoms can be improved with administration of dexamethasone.

==== Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities – edema ====
Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are abnormal differences seen in neuroimaging of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease patients given targeted amyloid-modifying therapies. Human monoclonal antibodies such as aducanumab, solanezumab, and bapineuzumab have been associated with these neuroimaging changes and additionally, cerebral edema. These therapies are associated with dysfunction of the tight endothelial junctions of the blood-brain barrier, leading to vasogenic edema as described above. In addition to edema, these therapies are associated with microhemorrhages in the brain known as ARIA-H. Familiarity with ARIA can aid radiologists and clinicians in determining optimal management for those affected.

==== Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ====
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare clinical disease characterized by cerebral edema. The exact pathophysiology, or cause, of the syndrome is still debated but is hypothesized to be related to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier. The syndrome features acute neurological symptoms and reversible subcortical vasogenic edema predominantly involving the parieto-occipital areas on MR imaging. PRES in general has a benign course, but PRES-related intracranial hemorrhage has been associated with a poor prognosis.

==== Idiopathic delayed-onset edema ====
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective treatment for several neurological and psychiatric disorders, most notably Parkinson&#x27;s disease. DBS is not without risks and although rare, idiopathic delayed-onset edema (IDE) surrounding the DBS leads have been reported. Symptoms can be mild and nonspecific, including reduction of the stimulation effect, and can be confused for other causes of edema. Thus, imaging is recommended to rule out other causes. The condition is generally self-limiting and the exact mechanism of the cause is unexplained. Early identification can help persons affected avoid unnecessary surgical procedures or antibiotic treatments.

==== Massive brain swelling after cranioplasty ====
Decompressive craniectomy is frequently performed in cases of resistant intracranial hypertension secondary to several neurological conditions and is commonly followed by cranioplasty. Complications, such as infection and hematomas after cranioplasty occur in roughly about a third of cases. Massive brain swelling after cranioplasty (MSBC) is a rare and potentially fatal complication of an uneventful cranioplasty that has recently been elucidated. Preoperative sinking skin flap (SSF) and intracranial hypotension were factors associated with the development of MSBC after cranioplasty. Data suggests that pathologic changes are triggered immediately following the procedure, especially an acute increase in intracranial pressure.

==== Radiation-induced brain edema ====
With the rise of sophisticated treatment modalities such as gamma knife, Cyberknife, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, a large number of individuals with brain tumors are treated with radiosurgery and radiotherapy. Radiation-induced brain edema (RIBE) is a potentially life-threatening complication of brain tissue radiation and is characterized radiation necrosis, endothelial cell dysfunction, increased capillary permeability, and breakdown of the blood–brain barrier. Symptoms include headache, seizure, psychomotor slowing, irritability, and focal neurological deficits. Options for management of RIBE are limited and include corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, multivitamins, and bevacizumab.

==== Brain tumor-associated cerebral edema ====
This kind of cerebral edema is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with brain tumors and characterized by a disruption of the blood brain barrier and vasogenic edema. The exact mechanism is unclear but hypothesized that cancerous glial cells (glioma) of the brain can increase secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which weakens the tight junctions of the blood–brain barrier. Historically, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone were used to reduce brain tumor-associated vascular permeability through poorly understood mechanisms and was associated with systemic side effects. Agents that target the VEGF signaling pathways, such as cediranib, have been promising in prolonging survival in &quot;rat&quot; models but associated with local and systemic side effects as well.

== Diagnosis ==
Cerebral edema is commonly present in a variety of neurological injuries. Thus, determining a definitive contribution of cerebral edema to the neurological status of an affected person can be challenging. Close bedside monitoring of a person&#x27;s level of consciousness and awareness of any new or worsening focal neurological deficits is imperative but demanding, frequently requiring admission into the intensive care unit (ICU).

Cerebral edema with sustained increased intracranial hypertension and brain herniation can signify impending catastrophic neurological events which require immediate recognition and treatment to prevent injury and even death. Therefore, diagnosis of cerebral edema earlier with rapid intervention can improve clinical outcomes and can mortality, or risk of death.

Diagnosis of cerebral edema relies on the following:

=== Imaging ===
Serial neuroimaging (CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging) can be useful in diagnosing or excluding intracranial hemorrhage, large masses, acute hydrocephalus, or brain herniation as well as providing information on the type of edema present and the extent of affected area. CT scan is the imaging modality of choice as it is widely available, quick, and with minimal risks. However, CT scan can be limited in determining the exact cause of cerebral edema in which cases, CT angiography (CTA), MRI, or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) may be necessary. MRI is particularly useful as it can differentiate between cytotoxic and vasogenic edema, guiding future treatment decisions.

=== Intracranial pressure monitoring ===
Intracranial pressure (ICP) and its management is a fundamental concept in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines recommend ICP monitoring in individuals with TBI that have decreased Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, abnormal CT scans, or additional risk factors such as older age and elevated blood pressure. However, no such guidelines exist for ICP monitoring in other brain injuries such as ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral neoplasm.

Clinical researches have recommended ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) monitoring in any persons with cerebral injury who are at risk of elevated intracranial pressure based on clinical and neuroimaging features. Early monitoring can be used to guide medical and surgical decision making and to detect potentially life-threatening brain herniation. There was however, conflicting evidence on the threshold values of ICP that indicated the need for intervention. Researchers also recommend that medical decisions should be tailored to the specific diagnosis (e.g. subarachnoid hemorrhage, TBI, encephalitis) and that ICP elevation should be used in conjunction with clinical and neuroimaging and not as an isolated prognostic marker.

==Treatment==
The primary goal in cerebral edema is to optimize and regulate cerebral perfusion, oxygenation, and venous drainage, decrease cerebral metabolic demands, and to stabilize the osmolality pressure gradient between the brain and the surrounding vasculature. As cerebral edema is linked to increased intracranial pressure (ICP), many of the therapies will focus on ICP.

=== General measures for managing cerebral edema ===

==== Positioning ====
Finding the optimal head position in persons with cerebral edema is necessary to avoid compression of the jugular vein and obstruction of venous outflow from the skull, and for decreasing cerebrospinal fluid hydrostatic pressure. The current recommendation is to elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees to optimize cerebral perfusion pressure and control the increase in intracranial pressure. It is also worth noting that measures should be taken to reduce restrictive neck dressings or garments as these may lead to compression of the internal jugular veins and reduce venous outflow.

==== Ventilation and oxygenation ====
Decreased oxygen concentration in the blood, hypoxia, and increase in the carbon dioxide concentration in the blood, hypercapnia, are potent vasodilators in the cerebral vasculature, and should be avoided in those with cerebral edema. It is recommended that persons with decreased levels of consciousness be intubated for airway protection and maintenance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. However, the laryngeal instrumentation involved in the intubation process is associated with an acute, brief rise in intracranial pressure. Pretreatment with a sedative agent and neuromuscular blocking agent to induce unconsciousness and motor paralysis has been recommended as part of standard Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI). Intravenous lidocaine prior to RSI has been suggested to reduce the rise in ICP but there is no supporting data at this time.

Additionally, ventilation with use of positive pressure (PEEP) can improve oxygenation with the negative effect of decreasing cerebral venous drainage and increasing intracranial pressure (ICP), and thus, must be used with caution.

==== Fluid management and cerebral perfusion ====
Maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure using appropriate fluid management is essential in patients with brain injury. Dehydration, or intravascular volume loss, and the use of hypotonic fluids, such as D5W or half normal saline, should be avoided. Blood serum ion concentration, or osmolality, should be maintained in the normo to hyperosmolar range. Judicial use of hypertonic saline can be used to increase serum osmolality and decrease cerebral edema, as discussed below.

Blood pressure should be sufficient so as to sustain cerebral perfusion pressures greater than 60 mm Hg for optimal blood blow to the brain. Vasopressors may be used to achieve adequate blood pressures with minimal risk of increasing intracranial pressures. However, sharp rises in blood pressure should be avoided. Maximum blood pressures tolerated are variable and controversial depending on the clinical situation.

==== Seizure prophylaxis ====
Seizures, including subclinical seizure activity, can complicate clinical courses and increase progression of brain herniation in persons with cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure. Anticonvulsants can be used to treat seizures caused by acute brain injuries from a variety of origins. However, there are no clear guidelines on the use of anticonvulsants for prophylactic use. Their use may be warranted on depending on the clinical scenario and studies have shown that anticonvulsants such as phenytoin can be given prophylactically without a significant increase in drug-related side effects.

==== Fever ====
Fever has been demonstrated to increase metabolism and oxygen demand in the brain. The increased metabolic demand results in an increase in cerebral blood flow and can increase the intracranial pressure within the skull. Therefore, maintaining a stable body temperature within the normal range is strongly recommended. This can be achieved through the use of antipyretics such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) and cooling the body, as described below.

==== Hyperglycemia ====
Elevated blood glucose levels, known as hyperglycemia, can exacerbate brain injury and cerebral edema and has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in persons affected by traumatic brain injuries, subarachnoid hemorrhages, and ischemic strokes.

==== Sedation ====
Pain and agitation can worsen cerebral edema, acutely increase intracranial pressure (ICP), and should be controlled. Careful use of pain medication such as morphine or fentanyl can be used for analgesia. For those persons with decreased levels of consciousness, sedation is necessary for endotracheal intubation and maintenance of a secure airway. Sedative medication used in the intubation process, specifically propofol, have been shown to control ICP, decrease cerebral metabolic demand, and have antiseizure properties. Due to a short half-life, propofol, is a quick-acting medication whose administration and removal is well tolerated, with hypotension being the limiting factor in its continued use. Additionally, the use of nondepolarizing neuromusclar blocking agents (NMBA), such as doxacurium or atracurium, have been indicated to facilitate ventilation and manage brain injuries but there are no controlled studies on the use of NMBAs in the management of increased intracranial pressure. Depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, most notably succinylcholine, can worsen increased ICP due to induction of muscle contraction within the body.

==== Nutrition ====
Nutritional support is necessary in all patients with acute brain injury. Enteral feeding, or through mouth via tube, is the preferred method, unless contraindicated. Additional attention must be placed on the solute concentration of the formulations to avoid free water intake, decreased serum osmolality, and worsening of the cerebral edema.

Elevated blood glucose, or hyperglycemia, is associated with increased edema in patients with cerebral ischemia and increases the risk of a hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke. Maintaining a normal blood glucose level of less than 180 mg/dL is suggested. However, tight glycemic control of blood glucose under 126 mg/dL is associated with worsening of stroke size.

=== Specific measures ===
Although cerebral edema is closely related to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral herniation and the general treatment strategies above are useful, the treatment should ultimately be tailored to the primary cause of the symptoms. The management of individual diseases are discussed separately.

The following interventions are more specific treatments for managing cerebral edema and increased ICP:

==== Osmotic therapy ====
The goal of osmotic therapy is to create a higher concentration of ions within the vasculature at the blood–brain barrier. This will create an osmotic pressure gradient and will cause the flow of water out of the brain and into the vasculature for drainage elsewhere. An ideal osmotic agent produces a favorable osmotic pressure gradient, is nontoxic, and is not filtered out by the blood–brain barrier. Hypertonic saline and mannitol are the main osmotic agents in use, while loop diuretics can aid in the removal of the excess fluid pulled out of the brain.

* Hypertonic saline is a highly concentrated solution of sodium chloride in water and is administered intravenously. It has a rapid-onset, with reduction of pressures within 5 minutes of infusion, lasting up to 12 hours in some cases, and with negligible rebound pressure. The exact volume and concentration of the hypertonic saline varies between clinical studies. Bolus doses, particularly at higher concentrations, for example 23.4%, are effective at reducing ICP and improving cerebral perfusion pressure. In traumatic brain injuries, a responsiveness to hypertonic saline lasting greater than 2 hours was associated with decreased chance of death and improved neurologic outcomes. The effects of hypertonic saline can be prolonged with combination to agents such as dextran or hydroxyethyl starch, although their use is currently controversial. When compared to mannitol, hypertonic saline has been shown to be as effective as mannitol in decreased ICP in neurocritical care and is more effective in many cases. Hypertonic saline may be preferable to mannitol in persons with hypovolemia or hyponatremia.
* Mannitol is an alcohol derivative of simple sugar mannose, and is historically the most commonly used osmotic diuretic. Mannitol acts as an inert solute in the blood, decreasing ICP through osmosis as discussed above. Additionally, mannitol decreases ICP and increased cerebral perfusion pressure by increasing reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid, dilutes and decreased the viscosity of the blood, and can cause cerebral vasoconstriction. Furthermore, mannitol acts in a dose-dependent manner and will not lower ICP if it is not elevated. However, the common limitation of the use of mannitol is its tendency to cause low blood pressure hypotension. Compared to hypertonic saline, mannitol may be more effective at increasing cerebral perfusion pressures and may be preferable in those with hypoperfusion.
* Loop diuretics, commonly furosemide, act within kidney to increase excretion of water and solutes. Combination with mannitol produces a profound diuresis and increases the risk of systemic dehydration and hypotension. Their use remains controversial.
* Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acts as a weak diuretic and modulates CSF production but has not role in the management of cerebral edema from acute brain injuries. It can be used in the outpatient management of cerebral edema caused by idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri).

==== Glucocorticoids ====
Glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, have been shown to decrease tight-junction permeability and stabilize the blood-brain barrier. Their main use has been in the management of vasogenic cerebral edema associated with brain tumors, brain irradiation, and surgical manipulation. Glucocorticoids have not been shown to have any benefit in ischemic stroke and have been found to be harmful in traumatic brain injury. Due to the negative side effects (such as peptic ulcers, hyperglycemia, and impairment of wound healing), steroid use should be restricted to cases where they are absolutely indicated.

==== Hyperventilation ====
As mentioned previously, hypoxia and hypercapnia are potent vasodilators in the cerebral vasculature, leading to increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and worsening of cerebral edema. Conversely, therapeutic hyperventilation can be used to lower the carbon dioxide content in the blood and reduce ICP through vasoconstriction. The effects of hyperventilation, although effective, are short-lived and once removed, can often lead to a rebound elevation of ICP. Furthermore, overaggressive hyperventilation and vasoconstriction and lead to severe reduction in CBF and cause cerebral ischemia, or strokes. As a result, standard practice is to slowly reverse hyperventilation while more definitive treatments aimed at the primary cause are instituted.

Prolonged hyperventilation in those with traumatic brain injuries has been shown to worsen outcomes.

==== Barbiturates ====
Induction of a coma via the use of barbiturates, most notably pentobarbital and thiopental, after brain injury is used for secondary treatment of refractory ICP. Yet their use is not without controversy and it is not clear whether barbiturates are favored over surgical decompression. In patients with traumatic brain injuries, barbiturates are effective in reducing ICP but have failed to show benefit to clinical outcomes. Evidence is limited for their use in cerebral disease that include tumor, intracranial hypertension, and ischemic stroke. There are several adverse effects of barbiturates that limit their use, such as lowering of systemic blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure, cardiodepression, immunosuppression, and systemic hypothermia.

==== Hypothermia ====
As discussed previously in the treatment of fever, temperature control has been shown to decrease metabolic demand and reduce further ischemic injury. In traumatic brain injury, induced hypothermia may reduce the risks of mortality, poor neurologic outcome in adults. However, outcomes varied greatly with depth and duration of hypothermia as well as rewarming procedures. In children with traumatic brain injury, there was no benefit to therapeutic hypothermia and increased the risk of mortality and arrhythmia. The adverse effects of hypothermia are serious and require clinical monitoring including increased chance of infection, coagulopathy, and electrolyte derangement. The current consensus is that adverse effects outweigh the benefits and its use restricted to clinical trials and refractory increased ICP to other therapies.

==== Surgery ====
The Monroe–Kellie doctrine states that the skull is a fixed and inelastic space and the accumulation of edema will compress vital brain tissue and blood vessels. Surgical treatment of cerebral edema in the context of cerebellar or cerebral infarction is typically done by removing part of the skull to allow expansion of the dura. This will help to reduce the volume constraints inside of the skull. A decompressive hemicraniectomy is the most commonly used procedure. Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown reduced risk of death with hemicraniectomy compared with medical management. However, no individual study has shown an improvement in the percentage of survivors with good functional outcomes.

Timing of decompressive craniectomy remains controversial, but is generally suggested that the surgery is best performed before there are clinical signs of brainstem compression. Postoperative complications include wound dehiscence, hydrocephalus, infection, and a substantial proportion of patients may also require tracheostomy and gastrotomy in the early phase after surgery.

== Outcomes ==
Cerebral edema is a severe complication of acute brain injuries, most notably ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injuries, and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

* Cerebral edema is the cause of death in 5% of all patients with cerebral infarction and mortality after large ischemic strokes with cerebral edema is roughly 20 to 30% despite medical and surgical interventions. Cerebral edema usually occurs between the second and fifth day after onset of symptoms. Large territory ischemic strokes can lead to the rapid development of malignant brain edema and increased intracranial pressure. Cerebral edema in the context of a malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarct has a mortality of 50 to 80% if treated conservatively. Individuals with cerebral edema had a worse 3-month functional outcome than those without edema. These effects were more pronounced with increasing extent of cerebral edema and were independent of the size of the infarct.
* Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents 70–90% of all reported head injuries. The presence of brain edema on the initial CT scan of those with traumatic brain injuries is an independent prognostic indicator of in-hospital death. The association of brain edema with increased in hospital risk of death was observed in TBI across all level of severity. Edema in the acute and chronic phases were associated with a worse neurologic and clinical outcome. Children with TBI and cerebral edema have worse clinical outcomes as well.

== Epidemiology ==
As cerebral edema is present with many common cerebral pathologies, the epidemiology of the disease is not easily defined. The incidence of this disorder should be considered in terms of its potential causes and is present in most cases of traumatic brain injury, central nervous system tumors, brain ischemia, and intracerebral hemorrhage.

* In one study, cerebral edema was found in 28% of those individuals with thrombolysis-treated ischemic strokes, 10% of which occurred in severe forms. A further study detected cerebral edema in 22.7% of cerebral ischemic strokes. A meta-analysis of current studies showed that 31% of those affected by ischemic strokes developed cerebral edema in 31% of cases.
* In traumatic brain injuries, cerebral edema occurred in greater than 60% of those with mass lesions, and in 15% of those with initial normal CT scans.

== Research ==
The current understanding of the pathophysiology of cerebral edema after traumatic brain injury or intracerebral hemorrhage is incomplete. Current treatment therapies aimed at cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure are effective at reducing intracranial hypertension but have unclear impacts on functional outcomes. Additionally, cerebral and ICP treatments have varied effects on individuals based on differing characteristics like age, gender, type of injury, and genetics. There are innumerable molecular pathways that contribute to cerebral edema, many of which have yet to be discovered. Researchers argue that the future treatment of cerebral edema will be based on advances in identifying the underlying pathophysiology and molecular characteristics of cerebral edema in a variety of cases. At the same time, improvement of radiographic markers, biomarkers, and analysis of clinical monitoring data is essential in treating cerebral edema.

Many studies of the mechanical properties of brain edema were conducted in the 2010s, most of them based on finite element analysis (FEA), a widely used numerical method in solid mechanics. For example, Gao and Ang used the finite element method to study changes in intracranial pressure during craniotomy operations. A second line of research on the condition looks at thermal conductivity, which is related to tissue water content.

<text>Brendan John Canty (born March 9, 1966) is an American musician, composer, producer and filmmaker, best known as the drummer for the band Fugazi.

In 2007, &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; ranked Canty at No. 29 on the list of &quot;50 Greatest Rock Drummers&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early years, Rites of Spring===
Brendan Canty was born in Teaneck, New Jersey, and grew up in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C., where his family moved when he was 10 months old. He began playing drums at the age of 15, debuting in Dischord Records band Deadline, one of the signature bands of the early D.C. hardcore scene in the summer of 1981. They recorded a demo at Inner Ear Studios that Fall, and from those sessions three tracks were used on the Dischord &quot;Flex Your Head&quot; compilation. After playing a number of shows through the following year, Deadline recorded one more session at Inner Ear in August 1982, just prior to disbanding. Canty continued his musical career in 1985 with Dischord band Rites of Spring, after which he played in One Last Wish and Happy Go Licky.

===Fugazi===

Canty was a near-original member of Fugazi as their drummer, replacing original drummer Colin Sears. Canty joined the band in 1987. He recorded and toured with the group until their &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; in 2003.

Many of Fugazi&#x27;s songs since &quot;Repeater&quot; are based on guitar riffs introduced at rehearsals by Canty. An adept multi-instrumentalist, Canty also writes songs on piano (he plays a skeletal version of &quot;Bed for the Scraping&quot; on the &quot;Instrument&quot; DVD), as well as bass lines for some songs. He is also noted for using a large farmers bell as part of his drum kit.

===Soundtrack work, film scoring, directing and side projects===
In 1989, Canty formed the band Girls Against Boys alongside Eli Janney. It was initially a side project for Canty, although he ultimately only appeared on one release by the band (1990&#x27;s &quot;Nineties vs. Eighties&quot;) as he turned his focus to Fugazi in 1990.

Canty frequently composes soundtrack music, primarily for documentaries, often with &quot;National Geographic&quot; and Discovery Channel. He also contributes to or helps produce other Washington D.C.-area recordings. During Fugazi&#x27;s post-2002 hiatus, Canty took part in a side project, Garland of Hours, with vocalist/cellist/keyboardist Amy Domingues and drummer/percussionist Jerry Busher, both of whom have contributed to Fugazi recordings and performances. Their first self-titled album was released on the Arrest Records label founded by Busher and Canty&#x27;s younger brother James, formerly of Nation of Ulysses.
He currently has a band with Joe Lally of Fugazi called The Messthetics, and has toured with the late Wayne Kramer in his revival of the MC5, MC50.

Canty&#x27;s score for the Sundance Channel documentary series &quot;The Hill&quot; premiered on August 23, 2006. Canty was the sole composer on Hard Time, for &quot;National Geographic&quot; for all four seasons from 2009 to 2012. Also, the composer on two of ESPN&#x27;s 30 for 30&#x27;s: Angry Sky, and Birth of Big Air. He scored the film Frank Serpico. He continues to score for film, television, and commercials.

In 2004, Canty and director Christoph Green co-founded the film Production company Trixie to release an ongoing series of music-related films entitled &quot;Burn to Shine&quot;. The series involves independent alternative music bands from a particular region showing up to perform one song live, without overdubs or corrections, in a house that is about to be demolished. The first volume was filmed in Canty&#x27;s home region of Washington, D.C., and features performances from Bob Mould, Weird War, Q and Not U, Ted Leo, French Toast, Medications, fellow Fugazi member Ian MacKaye&#x27;s side project The Evens, and Garland of Hours. A second volume, filmed in the Chicago area, was released in 2005, and a third filmed in Portland, Oregon came out August 20, 2006.

In late 2004 and early 2005, Canty contributed drum tracks to Bob Mould&#x27;s 2005 solo album, &quot;Body of Song&quot;. Canty was also the drummer for many dates on the winter 2005/2006 tour in support of the album. Canty returned as the drummer for Bob Mould&#x27;s District Line, released February 2008. Using the same crew and filming style as on the Burn to Shine series, Canty and Green made a concert film of a Bob Mould show, entitled &quot;Circle of Friends.&quot; Canty produced the film and played drums during the show, which took place at Washington D.C.&#x27;s 9:30 Club. In 2006, Canty and Green also made&quot;Sunken Treasure: Live in the Pacific Northwest&quot;, a 2006 Jeff Tweedy (Wilco) tour film, and the Wilco tour film &quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot;, which was released in 2009 and toured festivals extensively, eventually being broadcast on the Sundance Channel in the US, and being released on DVD and iTunes.

He produced Ted Leo and the Pharmacists&#x27;s &quot;Living With the Living&quot; and &quot;The Tyranny of Distance&quot; albums. He also produced Benjy Ferree, The Thermals&#x27;s &quot;The Body, The Blood, The Machine&quot;, and French Toast records, as well as mixing the self-titled debut album for The Aquarium. In 2011, he directed long-time friend Eddie Vedder&#x27;s new solo performance DVD release, &quot;Water on the Road&quot;, and took the drums for Vedder&#x27;s cover of &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;.

==Influence==
In 2007, &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; ranked Canty at No. 29 on their list of the &quot;50 Greatest Rock Drummers&quot; based on his drumming work with Fugazi. Canty has been cited as an influence by such drummers as Sara Lund of Unwound and multi-instrumentalist Joe Wong.

==Personal life==
His siblings include James Canty and writer Kevin Canty. He lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife and four children.

<text>Papyrology is the study of manuscripts of ancient literature, correspondence, legal archives, etc., preserved on portable media from antiquity, the most common form of which is papyrus, the principal writing material in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Papyrology includes both the translation and interpretation of ancient documents in a variety of languages as well as the care and conservation of rare papyrus originals.

Papyrology as a systematic discipline dates from the 1880s and 1890s, when large caches of well-preserved papyri were discovered by archaeologists in several locations in Egypt, such as Arsinoe (Faiyum) and Oxyrhynchus. Leading centres of papyrology include Oxford University, Heidelberg University, the Ägyptisches Museum und Papyrussamlung at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Columbia University, the University of Michigan, Leiden University, the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, 
University of California, Berkeley and the Istituto Papirologico &quot;G. Vitelli&quot; connected to the University of Florence.

Founders of papyrology were the Viennese orientalist (Arabic papyrology), Wilhelm Schubart (Greek papyrology), the Austrian antiquarian who acquired more than 100,000 Greek, Arabic, Coptic and Persian papyri in Egypt, which were bought by the Austrian Archduke Rainer to form the Rainer collection, G. F. Tsereteli, who published papyri of Russian and Georgian collections, Frederic George Kenyon, Otto Rubensohn, Ulrich Wilcken, Bernard Pyne Grenfell, Arthur Surridge Hunt and other distinguished scientists.

<doc id="378540" wikidata="Q5397099" url="?curid=378540" title="Shudder to Think">
<text>Shudder to Think was an American alternative rock band. Formed in 1986, they released three albums on the Washington, D.C.–based label Dischord Records, and two on Epic Records. Their early work was largely influenced by post-hardcore although they gradually drew upon a wide range of stylistic influences, including power pop and glam rock.

==History==
In 1984, bassist Stuart Hill formed the hardcore punk band Stüge, recruiting drummer Mike Russell, alongside guitarist Sam Fleming and vocalist Bobby Jones. By 1986, Fleming and Jones left for college, with Hill inviting guitarist Chris Matthews, who had been playing in new wave group 3-2-1, to join the band. Matthews in turn suggested vocalist Craig Wedren, a high school acquaintance, after seeing him perform at a school play and being impressed by his singing. Shortly after, the band changed its name to Shudder to Think, after Russell said that he “shuddered to think that we would be just another hardcore band” during a drive to practice. It was this lineup and name change that drove the band to abandon its previous hardcore influenced sound to something more akin to post-hardcore. 

In this incarnation, the band released one song on the Fetal Records compilation F-R-5 in 1987 (&quot;Too little, too late&quot;), two singles and one album (&quot;Curse, Spells, Voodoo, Mooses&quot;, 1989) before being signed by the Dischord label. Three albums were then released (&quot;Ten-Spot&quot;, 1990, &quot;Funeral at the Movies&quot;, 1991, and &quot;Get Your Goat&quot;, 1992), before the band gained greater exposure by touring with Fugazi and Smashing Pumpkins; with their May 7, 1992, show in Albig, Germany being released by Tobby Holzinger as Your Choice Live Series Vol.21.

Swiz ex-bassist Nathan Larson and ex-Jawbox drummer Adam Wade replaced Matthews and Russell in 1992 on guitar and drums respectively. Matthews and Russell last performed live with the band on January 1, 1992, and June 28, 1992, respectively, as announced by Wedren to the crowd during those concerts.

The band subsequently signed to Epic, with whom &quot;Pony Express Record&quot; was released in September 1994. The album&#x27;s angular, mathematical post-hardcore earned it a devoted cult following – especially after the video for the track &quot;X-French Tee Shirt&quot; became a buzz clip on MTV and was regularly aired on the channel, as well as an article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The track also peaked at #36 on the Radio and Records Alternative chart. The album had sold 30,000 copies in the United States by the end of October 1994, and by February 1997 had sold 60,000 copies.

Over the next few years, Wedren successfully battled Hodgkin&#x27;s Disease, Larson recorded an album with side project band Mind Science of the Mind, and Wade left the group. He was replaced by Kevin March, formerly drummer with Dambuilders.

They released another album, &quot;50,000 B.C.&quot; in 1997, touring in support of it with March on drums, and touring member Chuck Scott on keyboards and percussion. The album was released to mixed reviews and was a commercial flop. It was after this that the band pivoted to writing soundtracks for films, composing the soundtracks to &quot;First Love, Last Rites&quot;, &quot;High Art&quot;, and providing two songs for the film &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; in 1998.

However, 1998 marked Larson&#x27;s departure and the end of the group. Wedren has pursued a solo career, including an appearance on the &quot;Down to You&quot; soundtrack with &quot;Didn&#x27;t Mean to Do You Harm&quot;, and contributed backing vocals to Verve Pipe&#x27;s 1999 eponymous album.

Both Larson and Wedren have gone on to create highly regarded music for films. David Wain, founder of comedy troupe &quot;The State&quot;, was a high-school friend of Wedren&#x27;s, and Wedren&#x27;s music has appeared in many television series and films stemming from the troupe and its alumni, such as &quot;Reno 911!&quot; and &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot;. Wedren also makes solo music, and released his debut album, &quot;Lapland&quot;, in 2005. Larson has formed a new band called Hot One.

===Reunions===
Wedren, Larson, and March performed a brief set together on September 17, 2007, at The Mercury Lounge in New York City, which also featured guitarist Mark Watrous and Time of Orchids bassist Jesse Krakow playing in the lineup. The band continued to perform shows with Watrous and Krakow throughout 2008, with March playing the eastern dates and Wade on the western dates and New Orleans. The band released a live album entitled &quot;Live from Home&quot; in 2009. Without Larson, the band played what was billed as a &quot;final&quot; show on September 2, 2009, at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City. This show also featured founding guitarist Chris Matthews, who played during the show&#x27;s encore.

Shudder to Think reunited again in 2013 for the 20th anniversary of the Black Cat venue. In addition to a full set by the Pony Express Record lineup of Wedren, Larson, Wade and Hill, founding members Chris Matthews and Mike Russell performed on the encore.

==Legacy==
Shudder to Think has been listed as an influence by other bands – Incubus went as far as covering part of &quot;X-French Tee Shirt&quot; in their song &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot; during Lollapalooza in 2003. Jeff Buckley also listed Shudder to Think as a favorite band of his. In 1998 Pearl Jam invited Shudder to Think to open for them on a tour of Australia and even played a snippet of the Shudder song &quot;Pebbles&quot; during their set. Deftones have cited Shudder to Think as an influence and have even covered bits of &quot;X-French Tee Shirt&quot; and &quot;So Into You&quot; at live shows. Cursive mentions the band in their song &quot;Sink to the Beat&quot; off their EP, &quot;Burst and Bloom&quot;. Sunny Day Real Estate and Braid have also cited the band as an influence.

OK Go frontman Damian Kulash has expressed admiration for Shudder to Think, stating &quot;I worshipped them. There was one year I saw them twelve times.&quot; Kulash has specifically noted the band&#x27;s impact on his music:&quot;Shudder To Think: They taught me a certain sense of intentional rock. Their music was decidedly counter-intuitive. It was weird, especially &quot;Get Your Goat&quot; and &quot;Pony Express Record&quot;. It was music that refused to resolve something you already knew and was really beautiful and melodic and emotional. (...) Shudder made music unlike anything else you ever heard and was still poppy and beautiful and accessible. I think it convinced me that there’s space for music to be interesting and challenging while still beautiful.&quot;

==Musical style==
The band, which has been classified as post-hardcore, embraced &quot;pop influences and a skewed sense of songwriting&quot; while coming from a hardcore punk background &quot;courtesy of their affiliation&quot; with Dischord. Reviewer Charles Spano characterized some of the band&#x27;s work as the result of the group skewing &quot;their pop brilliance with Ric Ocasek grooves, a [David] Bowie and [...] Roxy Music glam bent [...], and the theatrics of Queen.&quot;

In the 2018 book &quot;Long Live Queen&quot;, when DJ/VJ Matt Pinfield was asked if Queen was an influence on 1990s alt-rock, he replied:&quot;Look at a band like Shudder to Think and a song like &#x27;X-French Tee Shirt,&#x27; which was such a great song, because [the middle part] was one note, and he was singing two octaves over that.&quot;

In an interview from 1995, James Iha of The Smashing Pumpkins praised the band&#x27;s originality, saying: &quot;Shudder to Think, I think, is a wholly original, amazing rock band. They&#x27;re a rock band but they&#x27;re totally different than what you&#x27;ve heard before in the guitar playing, the drumming, the bass, singing, it&#x27;s all amazing. If you listen to a Shudder to Think record, you might be able to point to a few references but there&#x27;s no way you could tag that band. And they&#x27;re good, they write good songs. They&#x27;re totally original.&quot;

<text>Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research is a non-profit research institute located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States that is dedicated to improving human health through basic biomedical research. It was founded as a fiscally independent entity from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where its 19 members all hold faculty appointments in the MIT Department of Biology or the MIT Department of Bioengineering. , Ruth Lehmann is its director; she succeeded David C. Page.

== History ==
Whitehead Institute was founded in 1982 by industrialist and philanthropist Edwin C. “Jack” Whitehead (1920–1992), who sought to establish a research institute &quot;dedicated to improving human health through basic biomedical science&quot;. Whitehead believed that while such an institution should be closely affiliated with an academic institution, it should remain wholly independent and self-governing. In David Baltimore (1975 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine), Whitehead found a partner who agreed that this approach would create an &quot;optimum environment for basic research&quot;. As Whitehead Institute&#x27;s Founding Director, Baltimore handpicked Harvey Lodish, and Robert Weinberg from MIT, Gerald Fink from Cornell University, and Rudolf Jaenisch from University of Hamburg, Germany, to be Whitehead Institute&#x27;s Founding Members. This group then identified promising younger scientists to be the first generation of Whitehead Members; and they established the Whitehead Fellows Program as a vehicle for accelerating the careers of highly promising young investigators.

Less than a decade after its founding, the Institute for Scientific Information in Philadelphia identified Whitehead as the top research institution in the world in molecular biology and genetics, based on the impact of its scientific publications. Whitehead Institute&#x27;s Center for Genome Research (CGR) became the single largest contributor to the Human Genome Project, and reportedly contributed one-third of the human genome sequence announced in June 2000.

In 2004 the CGR formed the independent Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, of which then-Whitehead Member Eric Lander was named Founding Director and President.

Whitehead Institute&#x27;s influence continues - over a 10-year period, papers published by Whitehead scientists had more impact in molecular biology and genetics than those from any of the 15 leading research universities and life sciences institutes in the United States. Training and education is integral to Whitehead Institute&#x27;s mission and approximately 300 undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and visiting scientists are integrally engaged in its research programs. Four times since 2009, the Whitehead Institute has been ranked first as the Best Place to Work for Postdocs in USA by &quot;The Scientist&quot; magazine.

Today, Whitehead scientists run research programs in cancer biology, developmental biology, genetics and genomics, metabolism, neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease, and regenerative medicine. In addition, numerous biotech companies have been launched by Whitehead Members or based on intellectual property developed at the institute, such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi Genzyme, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Rubius Therapeutics, and Verastem.

In 2019, according to the NACUBO report, the institute had an endowment of $527.9 million.

== Faculty ==
The Whitehead faculty currently comprises 19 members whose laboratories focus on biology&#x27;s most fundamental questions. The Members, who are all also MIT faculty members, are:
* David Bartel 
* Iain Cheeseman 
* Olivia Corradin
* Gerald R. Fink 
* Mary Gehring
* Rudolf Jaenisch 
* Ankur Jain
* Ruth Lehmann 
* Pulin Li
* Harvey F. Lodish 
* Sebastian Lourido
* David C. Page 
* Peter W. Reddien
* Robert A. Weinberg
* Jonathan Weissman 
* Jing-Ke Weng
* Yukiko Yamashita
* Richard A. Young

== Fellows Program ==
In addition to faculty-led labs, the Whitehead Fellows Program, established in 1984, provides an opportunity for highly accomplished recent PhDs and MDs to direct their own labs as Principal Investigators, rather than work in a senior researcher&#x27;s lab as a traditional postdoctoral researcher. Fellows receive dedicated lab space and funds for equipment, lab operations, salary, and core staffing. More than a dozen similar programs have since been established around the country, including those at the University of California/San Francisco, Carnegie Institution, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 

Past Whitehead Fellows include George Q. Daley, Dean of Harvard Medical School; Angelika Amon, the late MIT professor and cancer researcher; Kathleen Rubins, NASA astronaut and space biologist; and Stanford University professor Peter S. Kim, who is former President of Merck Research Laboratories. Current Whitehead Fellows include Lindsey Backman, who studies the human microbiome; Tobiloba Oni, who studies pancreatic cancer; and Kipp Weiskopf, who studies activation of myeloid cells in tumors to treat cancer.

<doc id="378555" wikidata="Q7196214" url="?curid=378555" title="Pinko">
<text>Pinko is a pejorative term for a person on the left of the political spectrum. The term has its origins in the notion that &quot;pink&quot; is a lighter shade of &quot;red,&quot; a color associated with communism. Thus &quot;pink&quot; could describe a &quot;lighter form of communism&quot;, purportedly promoted by supporters and believers of socialism who were not themselves actual or &quot;card carrying&quot; communists. The term pinko has a pejorative sense, whereas &quot;pink&quot; in this definition can be used in a purely descriptive sense, such as in the term pink tide.

One of the first recorded uses of &quot;pinko&quot; was in &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1925 as a variant on the noun and adjective &quot;pink&quot;, which had been used along with &quot;parlor pink&quot; since the beginning of the 20th century to refer to those of leftish sympathies, usually with an implication of effeteness. In the 1920s, for example, a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial described supporters of the Progressive politician Robert La Follette as &quot;visionaries, ne&#x27;er do wells, parlor pinks, reds, hyphenates [Americans with divided allegiance], soft handed agriculturalists and working men who have never seen a shovel.&quot;

&quot;Pinko&quot; was widely used during the Cold War to label individuals accused of supporting the Soviet Union and Communist China, including many supporters of former vice president Henry Wallace&#x27;s 1948 U.S. presidential campaign of the Progressive Party. Many politicians, like Richard Nixon, exploited the fear of communism by referring to their opponents as &quot;pinkos&quot;. The word was predominantly used in the United States, where opposition to Communism grew strong among the population, especially during the McCarthy era. It was also in common use in South Africa during the apartheid era. In his two presidential campaigns, Alabama governor George Wallace often railed at what he called &quot;the left-wing pinko press&quot; and &quot;pseudo-pinko-intellectuals.&quot;

Some of the most infamous uses of the term &quot;pink&quot; came during future president Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1950 Senate campaign against Helen Gahagan Douglas: &quot;She&#x27;s pink right down to her underwear!&quot; – a play on the fact that, at the time, pink was the usual color of women&#x27;s undergarments. Nixon regularly referred to her as &quot;the Pink Lady&quot;, and his campaign distributed political flyers printed on sheets of pink paper.

<doc id="378557" wikidata="Q459987" url="?curid=378557" title="Water vascular system">
<text>The water vascular system is a hydraulic system used by echinoderms, such as sea stars and sea urchins, for locomotion, food and waste transportation, and respiration. The system is composed of canals connecting numerous tube feet. Echinoderms move by alternately contracting muscles that force water into the tube feet, causing them to extend and push against the ground, then relaxing to allow the feet to retract.

The exact structure of the system varies somewhat between the five classes of echinoderm. The system is part of the coelomic cavities of echinoderms, together with the haemal coelom (or haemal system), perivisceral coelom, gonadal coelom and perihaemal coelom.

Other terms sometimes used to refer to the water vascular system are &quot;ambulacral system&quot; and &quot;aquiferous system&quot;. In the past, &quot;aquiferous system&quot; was also used to refer to many unrelated invertebrate structures, but today, it is restricted to water channels in sponges and the hydrostatic skeleton of some mollusks like &quot;Polinices&quot;.

==Sea stars==

In sea stars, water enters the system through a sieve-like structure on the upper surface of the animal, called the madreporite. This overlies a small sac, or ampulla, connected to a duct termed the stone canal, which is, as its name implies, commonly lined with calcareous material. The stone canal runs to a circular ring canal, from which radial canals run outwards along the ambulacral grooves. Each arm of a sea star has one such groove on its underside, while, in sea urchins, they run along the outside of the body.

Each side of the radial canals gives rise to a row of bulb-like ampullae, which are connected via lateral canals. In sea stars these are always staggered, so that an ampulla on the left follows one on the right, and so on down the length of the radial canal. The ampullae are connected to suckerlike podia. The entire structure is called a tube foot. In most cases, the small lateral canals connecting the ampullae to the radial canal are of equal length, so that the tube feet are arranged in two rows, one along each side of the groove. In some species, however, there are alternately long and short lateral canals, giving the appearance of two rows on each side of the groove, for four in total.

Contraction of the ampullae causes the podia to stretch as water is brought into them. This whole process allows for movement, and is quite powerful but extremely slow.

The central ring canal, in addition to connecting the radial canals to each other and to the stone canal, also has a number of other specialised structures on the inner surface. In between each radial canal, in many sea star species, there lies a muscular sac called a polian vesicle. The ring canal also has four or five pairs of complex pouches, called Tiedemann&#x27;s bodies. These apparently produce coelomocytes, amoeboid cells somewhat similar to the blood cells of vertebrates.

Although the contents of the water vascular system are essentially sea water, apart from coelomocytes, the fluid also contains some protein and high levels of potassium salts.

==Ophiuroids==
Ophiuroids, the group including brittle stars and basket stars, have a somewhat different water vascular system from sea stars, despite their superficially similar appearance. The madreporite is located on the underside of the animal, usually in one of the jaw plates. The stone canal runs upwards to the ring canal, typically located in a circular depression on the upper (i.e. internal) surface of the jaws. The ring canal has four polian vesicles.

Ophiuroids have no ambulacral groove, and the radial canals instead run through the solid bone-like ossicles of the arms. Unlike sea stars, the tube feet are paired instead of staggered, and there are no ampullae. Instead, a simple valve at the upper end of the foot helps to control water pressure in the tube feet, along with contraction of the associated canals.

==Sea urchins==
The madreporite of sea urchins is located within one of the plates surrounding the anus on the upper surface of the animal. The stone canal descends from the madreporite to the ring canal, which lies around the oesophagus, and includes a number of polian vesicles. Because sea urchins have no arms, the five radial canals simply run along the inside of the solid skeletal &quot;test&quot;, arching upwards towards the anus.

The ampullae branching off from either side of the radial canals give rise to ten rows of tube feet, which penetrate through holes in the test to the outside. As in sea stars, the ampullae are arranged alternately, but in most (though not all) cases they split into two as they pass through the test before merging again on the outer side. The tube feet of sea urchins are often highly modified for different purposes. The radial canal ends in a small water-filled tentacle which protrudes through the uppermost plate of the ambulacral region.

==Crinoids==
Uniquely among echinoderms, crinoids have no madreporite. Instead, the oral surface is dotted with numerous minute ciliated funnels that run into the main body cavity. The ring canal has several small stone canals, located between the arms of the animal, but these open into the body cavity, and thus are only indirectly connected to the outside.

The five radial canals run into the arms and branch several times to supply all of the individual branches and pinnules lining the arms. As in other echinoderms, the radial canals give rise to lateral canals, but there are no ampullae, and clusters of three tube feet branch from the ends of each canal, except around the mouth, where they are found singly. In the absence of ampullae, water pressure is maintained by the ring canal, which is surrounded by contractile muscle fibres.

==Sea cucumbers==
The water vascular system of sea cucumbers has no connection to the outside, and is thus filled with the internal coelomic fluid, rather than sea water. The madreporite is present, but lies within the body cavity, just below the pharynx. The stone canal is relatively short.

The ring canal normally has one to four polian vesicles, but in the order Apodida, there may be as many as fifty. The radial canals run through notches in the calcareous plates surrounding the mouth and then run along the ambulacral areas along the length of the body. Lateral canals run to both the tube feet and the large oral tentacles, all of which possess ampullae. The Apodida, which have no tube feet, also have no radial canals, with the canals to the tentacles branching off directly from the ring canal.991–992

<doc id="378561" wikidata="Q2268542" url="?curid=378561" title="Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold">
<text>Eric David Harris (April 9, 1981 – April 20, 1999) and Dylan Bennet Klebold ( ; September 11, 1981 – April 20, 1999) were American high school seniors and mass murderers who perpetrated the Columbine High School massacre at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999, in Columbine, Colorado. Harris and Klebold killed 12 students and one teacher and wounded 24 others. After killing most of their victims in the school&#x27;s library, they died by suicide. At the time, it was the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history.

The ensuing media frenzy and moral panic led to &quot;Columbine&quot; becoming a byword for school shootings, and becoming one of the most infamous mass shootings ever perpetrated in the United States.

Harris and Klebold were both born in 1981. Harris was born in Wichita, Kansas, but moved around frequently as a child due to his father&#x27;s occupation in the United States Air Force, while Klebold was born and raised near Columbine. Harris&#x27;s family eventually settled in Colorado in 1992. Shortly after, Harris and Klebold met while they were in the 7th grade. Over time, they became increasingly close. By the time they were juniors in high school, they were described as inseparable. There are differing reports; some say Harris and Klebold were very unpopular students once they were upperclassmen, as well as frequent targets of bullying, while others say they were not near the bottom of the school&#x27;s social hierarchy and that each had many friends, along with active social lives. Columbine High School was alleged to have an intense &quot;jock culture&quot;, which saw popular students, mainly athletes, benefit from special treatment from faculty and other students.

According to their journal entries, Harris and Klebold seem to have begun planning the attack by May 1998, nearly a year before the attack. Throughout the next eleven months, Harris and Klebold meticulously built explosives and gathered an arsenal of weapons. Both Harris and Klebold each left behind several journal writings and home videos, ones they made both alone and together, foreshadowing the massacre and explaining their motives. Harris and Klebold hoped this content would be viewed by the public extensively and inspire followers, although much of the evidence has never been released by authorities.

Harris and Klebold often wore trench coats in school, and in general, as part of their everyday outfits, so after the massacre, it was widely believed Harris and Klebold were part of a clique in school called the &quot;Trenchcoat Mafia&quot;, a group of misfits in the school who supposedly rebelled against the popular students. This turned out to be untrue, as neither Harris nor Klebold had any affiliation with the group. The pair&#x27;s aforementioned writings and videos gave insight into their rationale for the shooting. The FBI concluded that Harris was a psychopath, who exhibited narcissistic traits, unconstrained aggression, and a lack of empathy, while Klebold was concluded to be an angry depressive with a vengeful attitude toward individuals who he believed had mistreated him. However, neither Harris nor Klebold were formally diagnosed with any personality disorders prior to the attack, so this conclusion is often debated. In the following years, various media outlets attributed multiple motivating factors to the attack, including bullying, mental illness, racism, psychiatric medication, and violence in music, movies, and video games. Despite these conclusions, the exact motive for the attack remains inconclusive.

Harris and Klebold have become pop culture icons, with the pair often portrayed, referenced and seen in film, television, video games, music and books. Many killers since the shooting have taken inspiration from the pair (dubbed the Columbine effect), either hailing them as heroes or expressing sympathy for them. Harris and Klebold also have a fanbase, who have coined the term &quot;Columbiners&quot;, who write fan fiction and draw fan art of them. Others have also dressed as the duo for cosplay or Halloween.

==Early life==
===Eric Harris===
Eric David Harris was born on April 9, 1981, in Wichita, Kansas. Harris&#x27;s parents were both born and raised in Colorado. His mother, Katherine Ann Poole, was a homemaker. His father, Wayne Harris, was working in the United States Air Force as a transport pilot. In 1983, the family moved to Dayton, Ohio, when Harris was two years old. Six years later, the family relocated to Oscoda, Michigan. Michigan pastor William Stone lived across the street from the Harris family while they were located in Oscoda. Stone recalled them as &quot;great neighbors&quot; and often saw Wayne very engaged with his sons. The Harris family then moved to Plattsburgh, New York, in 1991. During his time at Stafford Middle School, Harris played Little League Baseball, regularly went to birthday parties and was &quot;part of the crowd&quot;. Kyle Ross, a former classmate of Harris, said, &quot;He was just a typical kid.&quot; The Harris family finally settled back in Littleton, Colorado the next year when Wayne retired from the military.

On a 1997 English class assignment, Harris wrote about how difficult the move was from New York to Colorado. &quot;It was the hardest moving from Plattsburgh. I have the most memories from there&quot;, Harris continued. &quot;When I left (his friends) I felt alone, lost and even agitated that I had spent so much time with them and now I have to go because of something I can&#x27;t stop.&quot; Harris, in a basement tape, blamed his father for moving the family around, forcing Harris to &quot;start out at the bottom of the ladder.&quot; Harris had a chest deformity known as pectus excavatum, in which the breastbone sinks into the chest. This made Harris reluctant to take his shirt off in gym class as other students ridiculed him. Harris had two cosmetic surgeries at age 12 and 13 to repair the deformity. The sunken chest was still mildly observable during his autopsy.

The Harris family lived in rented accommodations for the first three years that they lived in the Littleton area. While Harris was in 7th grade, he met Klebold. In 1996, the Harris family purchased and settled at a house south of Columbine High School. Harris&#x27;s older brother, Kevin, attended college at the University of Colorado. Harris&#x27;s father took a job with Flight Safety Services Corporation and Harris&#x27;s mother became a caterer.

Harris entered Columbine High School in 1995 as a freshman. Columbine had just gone through a major renovation and expansion. From all accounts, he had many friends and was left forward and mid-field on the Columbine soccer team for his freshman and sophomore year. Josh Swanson, one of his teammates, said that Harris was a &quot;solid&quot; soccer player who enjoyed the sport a lot. During his freshman year, Harris met Tiffany Typher. They had German class together. Typher later recounted that Harris quickly wooed her. Harris asked her to homecoming and she accepted. After the event, it appeared that Typher was no longer interested in seeing Harris anymore, for reasons never disclosed. When Typher refused to socialize with Harris again, Harris staged a fake suicide, sprawling on the ground with fake blood splashed all over him. When Typher saw him on the ground, she began to scream for help, at which point Harris and his friends began laughing, prompting Typher to storm off, shouting at Harris to get psychological help.

===Dylan Klebold===

Dylan Bennet Klebold was born on September 11, 1981, in Lakewood, Colorado, to Thomas and Sue Klebold. On the day after the shooting, Klebold&#x27;s mother remembered that shortly after Klebold&#x27;s birth, she described what felt like a shadow cast over her, warning her that this child would bring her great sorrow. &quot;I think I still make of it what I did at that time. It was a passing feeling that went over very quickly, like a shadow.&quot; Sue said in an interview with Colorado Public Radio. Klebold was soon diagnosed with pyloric stenosis, a condition in which the opening between the stomach and small intestines thickens, causing severe vomiting during the first few months of life.

Klebold&#x27;s parents had met when they were both studying art at Ohio State University. After they both graduated, they married in 1971, with their first child, Byron, being born in 1978. Thomas had initially worked as a sculptor, but then moved over to engineering to be more financially stable. Sue had worked in assistance services with disabled children. Furthermore, Klebold&#x27;s parents were pacifists and attended a Lutheran church with their children. Both Klebold and his older brother attended confirmation classes in accordance with the Lutheran tradition. As had been the case with his older brother, Klebold was named after a renowned poet, Dylan Thomas.
Klebold attended Normandy Elementary School for first and second grade and then transferred to Governor&#x27;s Ranch Elementary School where he was part of the Challenging High Intellectual Potential Students program for gifted children. According to reports, Klebold was exceptionally bright as a young child, although he appeared somewhat sheltered in elementary school. When he transitioned to Ken Caryl Middle School, he found it difficult. Fellow classmates recalled Klebold being painfully shy and quiet, often to an uncomfortable degree. Klebold&#x27;s parents were unconcerned with the fact that Klebold found the changing of schools uneasy, as they assumed it was just regular behavior among young adolescents. At the family home, the Klebolds also observed some rituals in keeping with Klebold&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather&#x27;s Jewish heritage.

During his earlier school years, Klebold played baseball, soccer and T-ball. Klebold was in Cub Scouts with friend Brooks Brown, whom he was friends with since the first grade. Brown lived near the house Harris&#x27;s parents had bought when they finally settled in Littleton, and rode the same bus as Harris. Shortly after, Klebold had met Harris and the pair quickly became best friends. Later, Harris introduced Klebold to his friend Nathan Dykeman, who also attended their middle school, and they all became a tight-knit group of friends.

==Background==

===Personalities===
Both Harris and Klebold worked together as cooks at a Blackjack Pizza, a mile south from Columbine High School. Harris was eventually promoted to shift leader. He and his group of friends were interested in computers, and were enrolled in a bowling class.

Some described Harris as charismatic, and others described him as nice and likable. Harris also often bragged about his ability to deceive others, once stating in a tape that he could make anyone believe anything. By his junior year, Harris was also known to be quick to anger, and threatened people with bombs. Classmates also related that Harris was fascinated by war, and wrote out violent fantasies about killing people he did not like.

Klebold was described by his peers and adults as painfully shy. Klebold often was fidgety whenever someone new talked to him, rarely opening up to people. Klebold was also exceptionally nervous in front of women. In the last year of his life, many noted a change in Klebold&#x27;s behavior. Unlike before, Klebold became short-tempered, often prone to sudden outbursts of anger.

===Friendship===
Much of the information on Harris and Klebold&#x27;s friendship is unknown, on their interactions and conversations, aside from the Basement Tapes, of which only transcripts have been released, aside from a short audio clip recorded surreptitiously by a victim&#x27;s father. The pair claimed they were going to make copies of the tapes to send to news stations, but never did so. Harris and Klebold met at Ken Caryl Middle School during their seventh grade year. Over time, they became increasingly close, hanging out by often going out bowling, carpooling and playing the video game &quot;Doom&quot; over a private server connected to their personal computers. By their junior year of high school, the boys were described as inseparable. Chad Laughlin, a close friend of Harris and Klebold, said that they always sat alone together at lunch and often kept to themselves.

A rumor eventually started that Harris and Klebold were gay and romantically involved, due to the time the pair spent together. It is unknown if they were aware of this rumor. Judy Brown believed Harris was more emotionally dependent on Klebold, who was more liked by the broader student population. In his journals, however, Klebold wrote that he felt that he was not accepted or loved by anyone. Due to these feelings, Klebold possibly sought validation from Harris. Klebold&#x27;s mother believes Harris&#x27;s rage, intermingled with Klebold&#x27;s self-destructive personality, caused the boys to feed off of each other and enter in what eventually became an unhealthy friendship.

===Columbine High School===
At Columbine High School, Harris and Klebold were active in school play productions, operated video productions and became computer assistants, maintaining the school&#x27;s computer server. According to early accounts of the shooting, they were very unpopular students and targets of bullying. While sources do support accounts of bullying specifically directed toward Harris and Klebold, accounts of them being outcasts have been reported to be false, since both of them had a close knit group of friends.

Harris and Klebold were initially reported to be members of a clique that was called the &quot;Trenchcoat Mafia&quot;, despite later confirmation that the pair had no connection to the group and furthermore did not appear in the group&#x27;s photo in Columbine High&#x27;s 1998 yearbook. Harris&#x27;s father erroneously stated that his son was &quot;a member of what they call the Trenchcoat Mafia&quot; in a call he made on the day of the shooting. Klebold attended the high school prom three days before the shootings with a classmate named Robyn Anderson.

Harris and Klebold linked their personal computers on a network and played video games over the Internet. Harris created a set of levels for the game &quot;Doom&quot;, which later became known as the &quot;Harris levels&quot;. The levels are downloadable over the internet through &quot;Doom&quot; WADs. Harris had a web presence under the handle &quot;REB&quot; (short for Rebel, a nod to the nickname of Columbine High&#x27;s sports teams) and other online aliases, including &quot;Rebldomakr&quot;, &quot;Rebdoomer&quot;, and &quot;Rebdomine&quot;. Klebold went by the names &quot;VoDKa&quot; and &quot;VoDkA&quot;, after the alcoholic beverage. Harris had various websites that hosted &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot; files, as well as team information for those with whom he gamed online. The sites openly espoused hatred for people in their neighborhood and the world in general. When the pair began experimenting with pipe bombs, they posted results of the explosions on the websites. The website was shut down by America Online after the shootings and was preserved for the FBI.

===Initial criminal activity===
On the night of January 30, 1998, Harris and Klebold broke into a locked van to steal computers and other electronic equipment. A short while after a Jefferson County sheriff&#x27;s officer drove upon the two boys parked further down road at another park entrance and since the park area was closed by that time of night, the arresting deputy decided to further inspect them. The deputy announced his presence as one of the boys prepared to move the stolen goods into the trunk of the car. Harris shortly after admitted to theft after the deputy asked about where the equipment came from. They were later charged with mischief, breaking and entering, trespassing, and theft. They both left good impressions on juvenile officers, who offered to expunge their criminal records if they agreed to attend a diversionary program which included community service and psychiatric treatment. Harris was required to attend anger management classes where, again, he made a favorable impression. The boys&#x27; probation officer discharged them from the program a few months ahead of schedule for good behavior. Regarding Harris, it was remarked that he was &quot;a very bright individual who is likely to succeed in life&quot;, while Klebold was said to be intelligent, but &quot;needs to understand that hard work is part of fulfilling a dream.&quot;

Several months later on April 30, Harris handed over the first version of a letter of apology he wrote to the owner of the van, which he completed the next month. In the letter, Harris expressed regret about his actions; however, in one of his journal entries dated April 12, he wrote: &quot;Isn&#x27;t america supposed to be the land of the free? how come, If im free, I cant deprive some fucking dumbshit from his possessions If he leaves them sitting in the front seat of his fucking van in plain sight in the middle of fucking nowhere on a fri-fucking-day night? Natural selection. Fucker should be shot. &quot;.

===&quot;Hitmen for Hire&quot;===
When an economics class had Harris make an ad for a business, he and Klebold made a video called &quot;Hitmen for Hire&quot; on December 8, 1998, which was released in February 2004. It depicts them as part of the Trench Coat Mafia, a clique in the school who wore black trench coats, extorting money for protecting preps from bullies. They were apparently not a part of the Trench Coat Mafia, but were friends with some of its members. They wore black trench coats on the day of the massacre, and the video seemed a kind of dress rehearsal, showing them walking the halls of the school, and shooting bullies outside with fake guns.

Both also displayed themes of violence in their creative writing projects; of a &quot;Doom&quot;-based story written by Harris on January 17, 1999, Harris&#x27;s teacher said: &quot;Yours is a unique approach and your writing works in a gruesome way — good details and mood setting.&quot;

==Acquiring arms==
Harris and Klebold were unable to legally purchase firearms due to their both being underage at the time. Klebold then enlisted Robyn Anderson, an 18-year-old Columbine student and old friend of Klebold&#x27;s, to make a straw purchase of two shotguns and a Hi-Point carbine for the pair. In exchange for her cooperation with the investigation that followed the shootings, no charges were filed against Anderson. After illegally acquiring the weapons, Klebold sawed off his Savage 311-D 12-gauge double-barrel shotgun, shortening the overall length to approximately . Meanwhile, Harris&#x27;s Savage-Springfield 12-gauge pump shotgun was sawn off to around .

The shooters also possessed a TEC-DC9 semi-automatic handgun, which had a long history. The manufacturer of the TEC-DC9 first sold it to Miami-based Navegar Incorporated. It was then sold to Zander&#x27;s Sporting Goods in Baldwin, Illinois, in 1994. The gun was later sold to a firearms dealer, Larry Russell, in Thornton, Colorado. In violation of federal law, Russell failed to keep records of the sale, yet he determined that the purchaser of the gun was twenty-one years of age or older. Two men, Mark Manes and Philip Duran, were convicted of supplying weapons to the two.

The bombs used by the pair varied and were crudely made from carbon dioxide canisters, galvanized pipe, and metal propane tanks. The Co2 and pipe bombs were primed with matches placed at one end end their fuses. Both had striker tips on their sleeves. When they rubbed against the bomb, the match head lit the fuse. The weekend before the shootings, Harris and Klebold had purchased propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store for a few hundred dollars. Several residents of the area claimed to have heard glass breaking and buzzing sounds from the Harris family&#x27;s garage, which later was concluded to indicate they were constructing pipe bombs.

More complex bombs, such as the one that detonated on the corner of South Wadsworth Boulevard and Ken Caryl Avenue, had timers. The two largest bombs built were found in the school cafeteria and were made from small propane tanks. Only one of these bombs went off, only partially detonating. It was estimated that if any of the bombs placed in the cafeteria had detonated properly, the blast could have caused extensive structural damage to the school and would have resulted in hundreds of casualties.

==Massacre==

On April 20, 1999, just weeks before Harris and Klebold were both due to graduate, Brooks Brown, who was smoking a cigarette outside during lunch break, saw Harris arrive at school. Brown had severed his friendship with Harris a year earlier after Harris had thrown a chunk of ice at his car windshield. Brown reconciled with Harris just prior to the shooting. Brown approached Harris near his car and scolded him for skipping his morning classes, because Harris was always serious about schoolwork and being on time. Harris replied, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter anymore.&quot; Harris followed up a few seconds later, &quot;Brooks, I like you now. Get out of here. Go home.&quot; Brown, who felt uneasy, quickly left the school grounds. At 11:19 am, he heard the first gunshots after he had walked some distance away from the school, and informed the police via a neighbor&#x27;s cell phone.

By that time, Klebold had already arrived at the school in a separate car, and the two boys left two duffel bags, each containing a 20-pound propane bomb, inside the cafeteria. Their original plans indicated that when these bombs detonated, Harris and Klebold would be waiting at their cars and would shoot, stab and throw bombs at survivors of the initial explosion as they ran out of the school. At noon, this would be followed by bombs set up in their personal cars detonating, killing first responders and others on scene. When these devices failed to detonate, Harris and Klebold resorted to gunning down their classmates and teachers. It was the deadliest high school shooting in U.S history until it was surpassed by the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting committed by Nikolas Cruz on February 14, 2018. Harris was responsible for eight of the thirteen confirmed deaths (Rachel Scott, Daniel Rohrbough, teacher Dave Sanders, Steve Curnow, Cassie Bernall, Isaiah Shoels, Kelly Fleming, and Daniel Mauser), while Klebold was responsible for the remaining five (Kyle Velasquez, Matthew Kechter, Lauren Townsend, John Tomlin, and Corey DePooter). There were 24 injured (21 of them by the shooters), most in critical condition.

===Suicide===
At 12:02 pm, Harris and Klebold returned to the library. Of the 56 library hostages, 34 remained unharmed, all of whom escaped after Harris and Klebold left the library initially. Investigators later found that Harris and Klebold had enough ammunition to have killed them all. This was 20 minutes after their lethal shooting spree had ended, leaving 12 students dead, one teacher dying, and another 24 students and staff injured. Ten of their victims had been killed in the library. It is believed they came back to the library to watch their car bombs detonate, which had been set up to explode at noon. This did not happen, as the aforementioned bombs failed. Harris and Klebold went to the west windows and opened fire on the police outside. No one was injured in the exchange. Between three and six minutes later, they walked to the bookshelves near a table where Patrick Ireland lay badly wounded and coming in and out of consciousness. Student Lisa Kreutz, injured in the earlier library attack, was also in the room, unable to move.

By 12:08 pm, Harris and Klebold had killed themselves. In a subsequent interview, Kreutz recalled hearing a comment such as, &quot;You in the library&quot;, around this time. Harris sat down with his back to a bookshelf and fired his shotgun through the roof of his mouth; Klebold went down on his knees and shot himself in the left temple with his TEC-9. An article by &quot;The Rocky Mountain News&quot; stated that Patti Nielson overheard them shout &quot;One! Two! Three!&quot; in unison, just before a loud boom. Nielson said that she had never spoken with either of the writers of the article, and evidence suggests otherwise. Just before shooting himself, Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail on a nearby table, underneath which Ireland was lying, which caused the tabletop to momentarily catch fire. Underneath the scorched film of material was a piece of Harris&#x27;s brain matter, suggesting Harris had shot himself by this point.

==Suggested rationales==

There was controversy over whether Harris and Klebold should be memorialized. Some were opposed, saying that it glorified murderers, while others argued that Harris and Klebold were also victims. Atop a hill near Columbine High School, crosses were erected for Harris and Klebold along with those for the people they killed, but the father of victim Daniel Rohrbough cut them down, saying that murderers should not be memorialized in the same place as victims.

===Overview===
Harris and Klebold wrote some about how they would carry out the massacre, and less about why. Klebold penned a rough outline of plans to follow on April 20, and another slightly different one in a journal found in Harris&#x27;s bedroom. In one entry on his computer, Harris referenced the Oklahoma City bombing, and they mentioned their wish to outdo it by causing the most deaths in US history. They also mentioned how they would like to leave a lasting impression on the world with this kind of violence. Much speculation occurred over the date chosen for their attack. The original intended date of the attack may have been April 19; Harris required more ammunition from Mark Manes, who did not deliver it until the evening of April 19.

Harris and Klebold were both avid fans of KMFDM, an industrial band led by German multi-instrumentalist Sascha Konietzko. It was revealed that lyrics to KMFDM songs (&quot;Son of a Gun&quot;, &quot;Stray Bullet&quot; and &quot;Waste&quot;) were posted on Harris&#x27;s website, and that the date of the massacre, April 20, coincided with both the release date of the album &quot;Adios&quot; and the birthday of Adolf Hitler. Harris noted the coincidence of the album&#x27;s title and April release date in his journal. In response, KMFDM&#x27;s Konietzko issued a statement that KMFDM was &quot;against war, oppression, fascism and violence against others&quot; and that &quot;none of us condone any Nazi beliefs whatsoever&quot;.

An April 22, 1999, article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Harris and Klebold:

They hated jocks, admired Nazis and scorned normalcy. They fancied themselves devotees of the Gothic subculture, even though they thrilled to the violence denounced by much of that fantasy world. They were white supremacists, but loved music by anti-racist rock bands.

The attack occurred on Hitler&#x27;s birthday, which led to speculation in the media. Some people, such as Robyn Anderson, who knew the perpetrators, stated that the pair were not obsessed with Nazism nor did they worship or admire Hitler in any way. Anderson stated, in retrospect, that there were many things the pair did not tell friends. In his journal, Harris mentioned his admiration of what he imagined to be natural selection, and wrote that he would like to put everyone in a super &quot;Doom&quot; game and see to it that the weak die and the strong live. On the day of the massacre, Harris wore a white T-shirt with the words &quot;Natural selection&quot; printed in black.

====Bullying====
At the end of Harris&#x27;s last journal entry, he wrote: &quot;I hate you people for leaving me out of so many fun things. And no don&#x27;t fucking say, &#x27;Well that&#x27;s your fault,&#x27; because it isn&#x27;t, you people had my phone number, and I asked and all, but no. No no no don&#x27;t let the weird-looking Eric KID come along, ooh fucking nooo.&quot; However, in another entry by Eric in his journal, he stated that even if he were complimented and respected more by his peers, the attack would&#x27;ve still, in all likelihood, occurred.

Similarly, Klebold wrote in his journal both about perceived rejection, bullying others, his desire to belong, and his extreme contempt for others. In January 1997, he wrote, &quot;I am GOD compared to some of those un-existable [sic] brainless zombies,&quot; referring to his perception of the morons of the world. In March 1997, he wrote, &quot;I do shit to supposedly ‘cleanse’ myself in a spiritual, moral sort of way... trying not to ridicule/make fun of people ([name omitted] at school), yet it does nothing to help my life morally.&quot;

Klebold said on the Basement Tapes, &quot;You&#x27;ve been giving us shit for years. You&#x27;re fucking gonna pay for all the shit! We don&#x27;t give a shit. Because we&#x27;re gonna die doing it.&quot; However, they also stated on the tapes that nobody is to blame and nobody could have prevented the attack.

Accounts from various parents and school staffers describe bullying at the school as &quot;rampant&quot;. Nathan Vanderau, a friend of Klebold, and Alisa Owen, Harris&#x27;s eighth-grade science partner, reported that Harris and Klebold were constantly picked on. Vanderau noted that a &quot;cup of fecal matter&quot; was thrown at them. &quot;People surrounded them in the commons and squirted ketchup packets all over them, laughing at them, calling them faggots&quot;, Brooks Brown says. &quot;That happened while teachers watched. They couldn&#x27;t fight back. They wore the ketchup all day and went home covered with it.&quot; In his book &quot;No Easy Answers: The Truth Behind Death at Columbine&quot;, Brown wrote that Harris was born with mild chest indent. This made him reluctant to take his shirt off in gym class, and other students would laugh at him.

&quot;A lot of the tension in the school came from the class above us&quot;, Chad Laughlin states. &quot;There were people fearful of walking by a table where you knew you didn&#x27;t belong, stuff like that. Certain groups certainly got preferential treatment across the board. I caught the tail end of one really horrible incident, and I know Dylan told his mother that it was the worst day of his life.&quot; That incident, according to Laughlin, involved seniors pelting Klebold with &quot;ketchup-covered tampons&quot; in the commons. However, other commentators have disputed the theory that bullying was the motivating factor. Jeff Kass who has also published a book on the attack believes that bullying wasn&#x27;t the cause. Peter Langman also argues against bullying being the cause of the attack. Other researchers have concurred.

====Journals and investigation====

Harris began keeping a journal in April 1998, a short time after the pair was charged with breaking into a van, for which each received ten months of juvenile intervention counseling and community service in January 1998. They began to formulate plans then, as reflected in their journals.

Harris wanted to join the United States Marine Corps, but his application was rejected shortly before the shootings because he was taking the drug fluvoxamine, an SSRI antidepressant, which he was required to take as part of court-ordered anger management therapy. Harris did not state in his application that he was taking any medications. According to the recruiting officer, Harris did not know about this rejection. Though some friends of Harris suggested that he had stopped taking the drug beforehand, the autopsy reports showed low therapeutic or normal (not toxic or lethal) blood-levels of fluvoxamine in his system, which was around 0.0031–0.0087 mg/ml, at the time of death. After the shootings, opponents of contemporary psychiatry like Peter Breggin claimed that the psychiatric medications prescribed to Harris after his conviction may have exacerbated his aggressiveness.

Klebold entitled his journal &quot;A Virtual Book: EXISTENCES&quot;. Klebold&#x27;s first journal entry was March 31, 1997, over a year prior to when Harris began his own writings, and in it, he talks about his depression and suicidal thoughts, over two years prior to the massacre. For the rest of his writings, Klebold often wrote about his view that he and Harris were &quot;god-like&quot; and more highly evolved than every other human being, but his secret journal records the aforementioned self-loathing and suicidal intentions. Page after page was covered in hearts, as he was secretly in love with a Columbine student. Although both had difficulty controlling their anger, Klebold&#x27;s anger had led to his being more prone to serious trouble than Harris. After their arrest, which both recorded as the most traumatic thing they had ever experienced, Klebold wrote a letter to Harris, saying how they would have so much fun getting revenge and killing police, and how his wrath from the January arrest would be &quot;god-like&quot;. On the day of the massacre, Klebold wore a black T-shirt which had the word &quot;WRATH&quot; printed in red. It was speculated that revenge for the arrest was a possible motive for the attack, and that the pair planned on having a massive gun battle with police during the shooting. Klebold wrote that life was no fun without a little death, and that he would like to spend the last moments of his life in nerve-wracking twists of murder and bloodshed. He concluded by saying that he would kill himself afterward in order to leave the world that he hated and go to a better place. Klebold was described as being &quot;hotheaded, but depressive and suicidal&quot;.

Some of the home-recorded videos, called &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;, have reportedly been destroyed by police. Harris and Klebold reportedly discussed their motives for the attacks in these videos and gave instructions in bomb making. Police cite the reason for withholding these tapes as an effort to prevent them from becoming &quot;call-to-arms&quot; and &quot;how-to&quot; videos that could inspire copycat killers. Some people have argued that releasing the tapes would be helpful, in terms of allowing psychologists to study them, which in turn could possibly help identify characteristics of future killers.

====Media accounts====
Initially, the shooters were believed to be members of a clique that called themselves the &quot;Trench Coat Mafia&quot;, a small group of Columbine&#x27;s self-styled outcasts who wore heavy black trench coats. Early reports described the members as also wearing German slogans and swastikas on their clothes. Additional media reports described the Trench Coat Mafia as a cult with ties to the neo-Nazi movement which fueled a media stigma and bias against the Trench Coat Mafia. The Trench Coat Mafia was a group of friends who hung out together, wore black trench coats, and prided themselves on being different from the &#x27;jocks&#x27; who had been bullying the members and who also coined the name Trench Coat Mafia. The trench coat inadvertently became the members&#x27; uniform after a mother of one of the members bought it as a present.

Investigation revealed that Harris and Klebold were only friends with one member of the group, Kristin Thiebault, and that most of the primary members of the Trench Coat Mafia had left the school by the time that Harris and Klebold committed the massacre. Most did not know the shooters, apart from their association with Thiebault, and none were considered suspects in the shootings or were charged with any involvement in the incident.

Marilyn Manson was blamed by the media in the wake of the Columbine shooting, and responded to criticism in an interview with Michael Moore, in which he was asked, &quot;If you were to talk directly to the kids at Columbine and the people in the community, what would you say to them if they were here right now?&quot;, to which he replied, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say a single word to them—I would listen to what they have to say, and that&#x27;s what no one did&quot;, referring to people ignoring red flags that rose from Harris and Klebold prior to the shooting.

====Psychological analysis====
Although early media reports attributed the shootings to a desire for revenge on the part of Harris and Klebold for bullying that they received, subsequent psychological analysis indicated Harris and Klebold harbored serious psychological problems. Harris and Klebold were never diagnosed with any mental disorders, which is overwhelmingly uncommon in mass shooters. According to Supervisory Special Agent Dwayne Fuselier, the FBI&#x27;s lead Columbine investigator and a clinical psychologist, Harris exhibited a pattern of grandiosity, contempt, and lack of empathy or remorse, distinctive traits of psychopaths that Harris concealed through deception. Fuselier adds that Harris engaged in mendacity not merely to protect himself, as Harris rationalized in his journal, but also for pleasure, as seen when Harris expressed his thoughts in his journal regarding how he and Klebold avoided prosecution for breaking into a van. Other leading psychiatrists concur that Harris was a psychopath.

According to psychologist Peter Langman, Klebold displayed signs of schizotypal personality disorder – he struck many people as odd due to his shy nature, appeared to have had disturbed thought processes and constantly misused language in unusual ways as evidenced by his journal. He appeared to have been delusional, viewed himself as &quot;god-like&quot;, and wrote that he was &quot;made a human without the possibility of BEING human.&quot; He was also convinced that others hated him and felt like he was being conspired against, even though according to many reports, Klebold was loved by his family and friends.

==Lawsuits==
In April 2001, the families of more than 30 victims were given shares in a $2,538,000 settlement by the families of the perpetrators, and the two men convicted of supplying the weapons used in the massacre. The Harrises and the Klebolds contributed $1,568,000 to the settlement from their own homeowners&#x27; policies, Manes contributed $720,000, and Duran contributed $250,000. The Harrises and the Klebolds were ordered to guarantee an additional $32,000 be available against any future claims. Manes was ordered to hold $80,000 against future claims, and Duran was ordered to hold $50,000.

One family had filed a $250-million lawsuit against the Harrises and Klebolds in 1999 and did not accept the 2001 settlement terms. A judge ordered the family to accept a $366,000 settlement in June 2003. In August 2003, the families of five other victims received undisclosed settlements from the Harrises and Klebolds.

==Reaction of Sue Klebold==
Sue Klebold, mother of Dylan Klebold, initially was in denial about Klebold&#x27;s involvement in the massacre, believing he was tricked by Harris into doing it, among other things. Six months later, she saw the Basement Tapes made by Harris and Klebold and acknowledged that Klebold was equally responsible for the killings. She spoke about the Columbine High School massacre publicly for the first time in an essay that appeared in the October 2009 issue of &quot;&quot;. In the piece, Klebold wrote: &quot;For the rest of my life, I will be haunted by the horror and anguish Dylan caused&quot;, and &quot;Dylan changed everything I believed about myself, about God, about family, and about love.&quot; Stating that she had no clue of her son&#x27;s intentions, she said: &quot;Once I saw his journals, it was clear to me that Dylan entered the school with the intention of dying there.&quot; In Andrew Solomon&#x27;s 2012 book &quot;Far from the Tree&quot;, she acknowledged that on the day of the massacre, when she discovered that Klebold was one of the shooters, she prayed he would kill himself (before committing mass murder). &quot;I had a sudden vision of what he might be doing. And so while every other mother in Littleton was praying that her child was safe, I had to pray that mine would die before he hurt anyone else.&quot;

In February 2016, Klebold published a memoir, titled &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Reckoning&quot;, about her experiences before and after the massacre. It was co-written by Laura Tucker and included an introduction by National Book Award winner Andrew Solomon. It received very favorable reviews, including from the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;. It peaked at No. 2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

On February 2, 2017, Klebold posted a TED Talk titled, &quot;My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story.&quot; As of January 2024, the video has over 12.1 million views. The site listed Klebold&#x27;s occupation as &quot;activist&quot;, and stated: &quot;Sue Klebold has become a passionate agent working to advance mental health awareness and intervention.&quot;

==Legacy==
ITV describes the legacy of Harris and Klebold as deadly, as they have inspired several instances of mass killings in the United States and globally. &quot;Napa Valley Register&quot; have called the pair &quot;cultural icons&quot;. Author of &quot;Columbine&quot;, Dave Cullen, called Harris and Klebold the fathers of the movement for disenfranchised youth. Harris and Klebold have also, as CNN referred to, left their inevitable mark on pop culture.

===Copycats===
The Columbine shooting influenced several subsequent school shootings, with many praising Harris and Klebold. Cho Seung-Hui, who perpetrated the Virginia Tech shooting, called them &quot;martyrs&quot;. In some cases, it has led to the closure of entire school districts. According to psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a legacy of the Columbine shootings is its &quot;allure to disaffected youth&quot;.

Ralph Larkin examined twelve major school shootings in the US in the following eight years and found that in eight of those, &quot;the shooters made explicit reference to Harris and Klebold.&quot; Larkin wrote that the Columbine massacre established a &quot;script&quot; for shootings. &quot;Numerous post-Columbine rampage shooters referred directly to Columbine as their inspiration; others attempted to supersede the Columbine shootings in body count.&quot;

A 2015 investigation by CNN identified &quot;more than 40 people ... charged with Columbine-style plots.&quot; A 2014 investigation by ABC News identified &quot;at least 17 attacks and another 36 alleged plots or serious threats against schools since the assault on Columbine High School that can be tied to the 1999 massacre.&quot; Ties identified by ABC News included online research by the perpetrators into the Columbine shooting, clipping news coverage and images of Columbine, explicit statements of admiration of Harris and Klebold, such as writings in journals and on social media, in video posts, and in police interviews, timing planned to an anniversary of Columbine, plans to exceed the Columbine victim counts, and other ties. 60 mass shootings have been carried out, where the perpetrators had made at least a single reference to Harris and Klebold.

In 2015, journalist Malcolm Gladwell writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine proposed a threshold model of school shootings in which Harris and Klebold were the triggering actors in &quot;a slow-motion, ever-evolving riot, in which each new participant&#x27;s action makes sense in reaction to and in combination with those who came before.&quot;

In 2024, Natalie Rupnow, who carried out the Abundant Life Christian School shooting in Madison, Wisconsin, was revealed to have worn a KMFDM shirt like Harris, which suggested that she may have intented to copycat Harris when she carried out the shooting.

===Fandom===
Harris and Klebold have also spawned a fandom who call themselves &quot;Columbiners&quot;, mostly apparent on blogging site Tumblr. While some just have a scholarly interest in the pair or the event, the vast majority of these individuals, mostly young women, express a sympathetic, or sometimes even sexual interest, in Harris and Klebold. There has been homoerotic art drawn of the two, fan fiction created on the pair&#x27;s future together had they not gone through with the shooting and costumes created on the outfits Harris and Klebold sported the day of the shootings.

&quot;I relate to their feelings of hopelessness, being angry and not being able to change it, and wanting to be accepted and appreciated&quot;, an 18-year-old Tumblr user wrote on Harris and Klebold. &quot;No one noticed they were struggling, and no one took their suffering seriously&quot;, added another user. A news site called &quot;All That&#x27;s Interesting&quot; said on the fandom, &quot;Many of these Columbiners have no positive feelings about the massacre, but are instead focused on the troubled inner lives of its perpetrators because they see themselves in them.&quot; The fandom has received criticism for heroizing Harris and Klebold and allegedly inspiring shooting plots such as the Halifax mass shooting plot.

===Media about the duo===
The 2002 Michael Moore documentary film &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; focuses heavily on a perceived American obsession with handguns, its grip on Jefferson County, Colorado, and its role in the shooting.

In 2004, the shooting was dramatized in the documentary &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, in which Harris and Klebold are played by Ben Johnson and Josh Young, respectively.

In 2005, game designer Danny Ledonne created a role-playing video game where the player assumes the role of Harris and Klebold during the massacre, entitled &quot;Super Columbine Massacre RPG!&quot;. The game received substantial media backlash for allegedly glorifying the pair&#x27;s actions. The father of one victim remarked to the press that the game &quot;disgusts me. You trivialize the actions of two murderers and the lives of the innocent.&quot;

The 2016 biographical film &quot;I&#x27;m Not Ashamed&quot;, based on the journals of Rachel Scott, includes glimpses of Harris&#x27;s and Klebold&#x27;s lives and of interactions between them and other students at Columbine High School. Harris is played by David Errigo Jr. and Klebold is played by Cory Chapman.

===Fiction inspired by the duo===
The 2003 Gus Van Sant film &quot;Elephant&quot; depicts a fictional school shooting, some of whose details were based on the Columbine massacre, such as one scene in which one of the young killers walks into the evacuated school cafeteria and pauses to take a sip from a drink left behind, as Harris did during the shooting. In the film, the killers are called &quot;Alex and Eric&quot; after the actors who portray them, Alex Frost and Eric Deulen.

In the 2003 Ben Coccio film &quot;Zero Day&quot;, which was inspired by the Columbine shooting, two shooters are played by Andre Keuck and Cal Robertson and called &quot;Andre and Calvin&quot; after their actors.

<text>Hydrozoa (hydrozoans; from Ancient Greek (&#x27;; &quot;[[water]]&quot;) and (&#x27;; &quot;animals&quot;)) is a taxonomic class of individually very small, predatory animals, some solitary and some colonial, most of which inhabit saline water. The colonies of the colonial species can be large, and in some cases the specialized individual animals cannot survive outside the colony. A few genera within this class live in freshwater habitats. Hydrozoans are related to jellyfish and corals, which also belong to the phylum Cnidaria.

Some examples of hydrozoans are the freshwater jelly (&quot;Craspedacusta sowerbyi&quot;), freshwater polyps (&quot;Hydra&quot;), &quot;Obelia&quot;, Portuguese man o&#x27; war (&quot;Physalia physalis&quot;), chondrophores (Porpitidae), and pink-hearted hydroids (&quot;Tubularia&quot;).

==Anatomy==
Most hydrozoan species include both a polypoid and a medusoid stage in their life cycles, although a number of them have only one or the other. For example, &quot;Hydra&quot; has no medusoid stage, while &quot;Liriope&quot; lacks the polypoid stage.

===Polyps===
The hydroid form is usually colonial, with multiple polyps connected by tubelike hydrocauli. The hollow cavity in the middle of the polyp extends into the associated hydrocaulus, so that all the individuals of the colony are intimately connected. Where the hydrocaulus runs along the substrate, it forms a horizontal root-like stolon that anchors the colony to the bottom.
The colonies are generally small, no more than a few centimeters across, but some in Siphonophorae can reach sizes of several meters. They may have a tree-like or fan-like appearance, depending on species. The polyps themselves are usually tiny, although some noncolonial species are much larger, reaching , or, in the case of the deep-sea &quot;Branchiocerianthus&quot;, a remarkable 2 m (6.6 ft).

The hydrocaulus is usually surrounded by a sheath of chitin and proteins called the perisarc. In some species, this extends upwards to also enclose part of the polyps, in some cases including a closeable lid through which the polyp may extend its tentacles.

In any given colony, the majority of polyps are specialized for feeding. These have a more or less cylindrical body with a terminal mouth on a raised protuberance called the , surrounded by a number of tentacles. The polyp contains a central cavity, in which initial digestion takes place. Partially digested food may then be passed into the hydrocaulus for distribution around the colony and completion of the digestion process. Unlike some other cnidarian groups, the lining of the central cavity lacks stinging nematocysts, which are found only on the tentacles and outer surface.

All colonial hydrozoans also include some polyps specialized for reproduction. These lack tentacles and contain numerous buds from which the medusoid stage of the life cycle is produced. The arrangement and type of these reproductive polyps varies considerably between different groups.

In addition to these two basic types of polyps, a few colonial species have other specialized forms. In some, defensive polyps are found, armed with large numbers of stinging cells. In others, one polyp may develop as a large float, from which the other polyps hang down, allowing the colony to drift in open water instead of being anchored to a solid surface.

===Medusae===
The medusae of hydrozoans are smaller than those of typical jellyfish, ranging from in diameter. Although most hydrozoans have a medusoid stage, this is not always free-living and in many species exists solely as a sexually reproducing bud on the surface of the hydroid colony. Sometimes, these medusoid buds may be so degenerated as to entirely lack tentacles or mouths, essentially consisting of an isolated gonad.

The body consists of a dome-like umbrella ringed by tentacles. A tube-like structure hangs down from the centre of the umbrella and includes the mouth at its tip. Most hydrozoan medusae have just four tentacles, although a number of exceptions exist. Stinging cells are found on the tentacles and around the mouth.

The mouth leads into a central stomach cavity. Four radial canals connect the stomach to an additional, circular canal running around the base of the bell, just above the tentacles. Striated muscle fibres also line the rim of the bell, allowing the animal to move along by alternately contracting and relaxing its body. An additional shelf of tissue lies just inside the rim, narrowing the aperture at the base of the umbrella, and thereby increasing the force of the expelled jet of water.

The nervous system is unusually advanced for cnidarians. Two nerve rings lie close to the margin of the bell, and send fibres into the muscles and tentacles. The genus &quot;Sarsia&quot; has even been reported to possess organised ganglia. Numerous sense organs are closely associated with the nerve rings. Mostly these are simple sensory nerve endings, but they also include statocysts and primitive light-sensitive ocelli.

==Life cycle==
Hydroid colonies are usually dioecious, which means they have separate sexes—all the polyps in each colony are either male or female, but not usually both sexes in the same colony. In some species, the reproductive polyps, known as gonozooids (or &quot;gonotheca&quot; in thecate hydrozoans) bud off asexually produced medusae. These tiny, new medusae (which are either male or female) mature and spawn, releasing gametes freely into the sea in most cases. Zygotes become free-swimming planula larvae or actinula larvae that either settle on a suitable substrate (in the case of planulae), or swim and develop into another medusa or polyp directly (actinulae). Colonial hydrozoans include siphonophore colonies, &quot;Hydractinia&quot;, &quot;Obelia&quot;, and many others.

In hydrozoan species with both polyp and medusa generations, the medusa stage is the sexually reproductive phase. Medusae of these species of Hydrozoa are known as &quot;hydromedusae&quot;. Most hydromedusae have shorter lifespans than the larger scyphozoan jellyfish. Some species of hydromedusae release gametes shortly after they are themselves released from the hydroids (as in the case of fire corals), living only a few hours, while other species of hydromedusae grow and feed in the plankton for months, spawning daily for many days before their supply of food or other water conditions deteriorate and cause their demise.

Additionally, some hydrozoan species (particularly in Turritopsis genus) share an unusual life cycle among the animals - they can transform themselves from sexually mature medusae stage back to their juvenile hydroid stage.

==Systematics and evolution==
The earliest hydrozoans may be from the Vendian (late Precambrian), more than 540 million years ago.

Hydrozoan systematics are highly complex. Several approaches for expressing their interrelationships were proposed and heavily contested since the late 19th century, but in more recent times a consensus seems to be emerging.

Historically, the hydrozoans were divided into a number of orders, according to their mode of growth and reproduction. Most famous among these was probably the assemblage called &quot;Hydroida&quot;, but this group is apparently paraphyletic, united by plesiomorphic (ancestral) traits. Other such orders were the Anthoathecatae, Actinulidae, Laingiomedusae, Polypodiozoa, Siphonophorae and Trachylina.

As far as can be told from the molecular and morphological data at hand, the Siphonophora for example were just highly specialized &quot;hydroids,&quot; whereas the Limnomedusae—presumed to be a &quot;hydroid&quot; suborder—were simply very primitive hydrozoans and not closely related to the other &quot;hydroids.&quot; So, the hydrozoans now are at least tentatively divided into two subclasses, the Leptolinae (containing the bulk of the former &quot;Hydroida&quot; and the Siphonophora) and the Trachylinae, containing the others (including the Limnomedusae). The monophyly of several of the presumed orders in each subclass is still in need of verification.

In any case, according to this classification, the hydrozoans can be subdivided as follows, with taxon names emended to end in &quot;-ae&quot;:

Class Hydrozoa
* Subclass Hydroidolina
** Order Anthoathecata (= Anthoathecata(e), Athecata(e), Anthomedusae, Stylasterina(e)) — includes Laingoimedusae but monophyly requires verification
** Order Leptothecata (= Leptothecata(e), Thecaphora(e), Thecata(e), Leptomedusae)
** Order Siphonophorae
* Subclass Trachylinae
** Order Actinulidae
** Order Limnomedusae — monophyly requires verification; tentatively placed here
** Order Narcomedusae
** Order Trachymedusae — monophyly requires verification

ITIS uses the same system, but unlike here, does not use the oldest available names for many groups.

In addition, there exists a cnidarian parasite, &quot;Polypodium hydriforme&quot;, which lives inside its host&#x27;s cells. It is sometimes placed in the Hydrozoa, though its relationships are currently unresolved—a somewhat controversial 18S rRNA sequence analysis found it to be closer to the also parasitic Myxozoan. It was traditionally placed in its own class, Polypodiozoa, and this view is often seen to reflect the uncertainties surrounding this highly distinct animal.

===Other classifications===

Some of the more widespread classification systems for the Hydrozoa are listed below. Though they are often found in seemingly authoritative Internet sources and databases, they do not agree with the available data.Especially the presumed phylogenetic distinctness of the Siphonophorae is a major flaw that was corrected only recently. 

The obsolete classification mentioned above was:
* Order Actinulidae
* Order Anthoathecatae
* Order Hydroida
** Suborder Anthomedusae
** Suborder Leptomedusae
** Suborder Limnomedusae
* Order Laingiomedusae
* Order Polypodiozoa
* Order Siphonophorae

* Order Trachylina
** Suborder Narcomedusae
** Suborder Trachymedusae

A very old classification that is sometimes still seen is:
* Order Hydroida
* Order Milleporina
* Order Siphonophorae
* Order Stylasterina (= Anthomedusae)
* Order Trachylinida

Catalogue of Life uses:

<doc id="378577" wikidata="Q1783098" url="?curid=378577" title="Grand Duchy of Posen">
<text>The Grand Duchy of Posen (; ) was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, created from territories annexed by Prussia after the Partitions of Poland, and formally established following the Congress of Vienna in 1815. On 9 February 1849, the Prussian administration renamed the grand duchy the Province of Posen. Its former name was unofficially used afterward for denoting the territory, especially by Poles, and today is used by modern historians to refer to different political entities until 1918. Its capital was Posen (). The title of Grand Duke of Posen remained until 1918 to the King of Prussia.

==History==
===Background===

Originally part of the Kingdom of Poland, this area largely coincided with Greater Poland. The eastern portions of the territory were taken by the Kingdom of Prussia during the Partitions of Poland; during the first partition (1772), Prussia took just the Netze District, the portion along the Noteć () river. Prussia added the remainder during the second partition in 1793. Prussia briefly lost control during the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794.

It was initially administered as the province of South Prussia. The Poles were the primary ally of Napoleon Bonaparte in Central Europe, participating in the Greater Poland Uprising of 1806 and supplying troops for his campaigns. After the defeat of Prussia by Napoleonic France, the Duchy of Warsaw was created by the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807.

===1815–1830===
Following the Congress of Vienna, portions of the Prussia&#x27;s Polish territories were ceded to Congress Poland, a kingdom ruled in personal union by the Russian Czar. From the remainder the Grand Duchy of Posen was created with the city of Posen as the administrative centre and the seat of the Statthalter Prince Antoni Henryk Radziwiłł. In reality the governing power over the region lay with the provincial upper-president Joseph Zerboni di Sposetti.

At the beginning of the Prussian takeover of Polish territories, the discrimination and repression of Poles consisted of reducing their access to education and the judicial system. Prussian officials identified Germanisation as the progress of higher culture over a lower one. As a result, the local administration discriminated against Poles. After 1824 attempts to Germanise the school system were hastened and the government refused to establish a Polish university in Posen. Polish politicians issued protests against Prussian policies and a secret, patriotic Polish organisation was founded called &quot;Towarzystwo Kosynierów&quot; (Society of Scythemen). Resistance activity of Poles resulted in reaction from Berlin, where a trial was held in connection to links between Poles from the Grand Duchy with Poles from Russian-ruled Congress Poland.

===1830–1840===

The 1830 November Uprising within Congress Poland against the Russian Empire was significantly supported by Poles from the Grand Duchy. Afterward, the Prussian administration under Oberpräsident Eduard Flottwell known for his anti-Polonism introduced a stricter system of repression against the Poles. Prussian authorities attempted to expel Poles from administration to weaken the Polish nobility by buying its lands out, and, after 1832, the role of the Polish language in education was significantly repressed. Local self-government in the landed estates of land-lords, which was dominated by Polish nobility, was abolished, and instead the Prussian state appointed commissioners. Monasteries and their assets were confiscated by Prussia. The office of the governor (Statthalter) was abolished. Germanisation of institutions, education as well through colonisation was implemented.

===1840–1846===
On September 11, 1840, an audience was held by the Prussian king for deputies coming from the Grand Duchy. Count Edward Raczyński, in the name of all Polish members of the Grand Duchy Sejm (parliament), issued a complaint against the repression and discrimination of the Polish population which went against guarantees made in 1815. He accused the Prussian authorities of removing the Polish language from public institutions, courts and schools, as well as deleting the history of Poland from school teaching and substituting the name &quot;Province of Posen&quot; for the previous &quot;Grand Duchy of Posen&quot;. He also blamed the authorities for erasing the Polish Eagle from the Grand Duchy&#x27;s seals and emblems and for expelling Poles from offices in order to replace them with Prussians or foreign-born persons of German ethnicity. When land owners of Polish ethnicity sold land, it was often bought in order to resell it to colonists of German ethnicity. The Prussian king rejected the complaint; he was fully supportive of the Germanisation of Polish areas. However, he believed it had to be done through different methods, and in May 1841 decided to name Flottwell upper-president of the Prussian Province of Saxony, which included large territories annexed from the Kingdom of Saxony in 1815.

===Greater Poland Uprising of 1846===
Before 1848, repressions intensified in the Grand Duchy, censorship was strengthened, settlers of German ethnicity were brought in. Large patriotic demonstrations were held in memory of Antoni Babiński, a member of the Polish Democratic Society. He had been wounded by a gunshot, when the Prussian gendarme attempting to arrest him, engaged in a fight with him. Babiński was then captured, sentenced to death and executed in Posen. His public execution in February 1847 was accompanied by public mourning. Cloth soaked in his blood and other remains were distributed as national relics. Large prayers were held in his memory, often against orders of Prussia. Members of such gatherings were persecuted by police. At the same time the national self-awareness grew among the rural population of Polish and German ethnicity alike. Whereas two thirds of the grand ducal population identified as ethnically Polish (mostly in the centre, south and east), one third envisioned themselves as being of German ethnicity. Anti-Prussian sentiment grew as response to policy of Germanisation and repression by Prussian authorities and the conspiracy organisation called Związek Plebejuszy found a potent ground. It was led by bookseller Walenty Stefański, poet Ryszard Berwiński and lawyer Jakub Krauthofer-Krotowski.

===Frankfurt Parliament of 1848 and the Duchy===

During the Revolutions of 1848, the Frankfurt Parliament attempted to divide the grand duchy into two parts: the Province of Posen, which would have been annexed into an united Germany, and the Province of Gniezno, which would have remained outside Germany, but because of the protest of Polish parliamentarians these plans failed and the integrity of the grand duchy was preserved. However, on February 9, 1849, after a series of broken assurances, the Prussian administration renamed the grand duchy the Province of Posen. Nevertheless, the territory remained outside of the German Confederation until its dissolution and but was incorporated into the North German Confederation upon its foundation. The Prussian kings retained the title of &quot;Grand Duke of Posen&quot; until the fall of the monarchy in 1918.

==Area and Population==

The grand duchy was in area and was subdivided into two government districts: Posen and Bromberg. The regions were further divided into 26 original districts (, ) headed by &quot;Landräte&quot; (&quot;district councillors&quot;). Later, these were redivided into 40 districts, plus two urban districts. In 1824, the Grand Duchy also received a provincial council (term started in 1827) but with little administrative power, limited to providing advice. In 1817, the Culmerland (Chełmno Land) was moved to West Prussia. From the 1820s, the grand duchy had a parliament, the Sejm of the Grand Duchy of Posen. Today much of the territory lies within the Greater Poland and Kuyavian–Pomeranian voivodeships.

Population:
* 900,000 (1815)
* 1,350,000 (1849)
* 2,100,000 (1910)

Since in the first half of the 19th century there was no census or other statistics also recording the ethnic identities of the inhabitants of the grand duchy its ethnic composition can only be derived from its religious makeup then recorded in the census. By 1815 in the grand duchy Catholics were by majority Polish-speaking, most Protestants were native speakers of German and many Jews then spoke Yiddish. Based on the religious data it was estimated that in 1815 ethnic Poles made up about 657,000 persons (or 73% of the overall population), while ethnic Germans were 225,000 (25%) and 18,000 (or 2%) were of the Yiddish culture. In 1819, according to Georg Hassel ethnic Poles were 77% of the population, ethnic Germans 17.5% and Jews 5.5%.

Whereas in 1812 Jews in then Prussia proper had been emancipated and naturalised, the Jews of the grand duchy were excluded from citizens franchise, but like women and non-propertied classes mere subjects of the grand duke. Only Christian men, if owning land, were enfranchised as citizens. Whereas Christians had freedom of moving from the grand duchy to Prussia proper, the grand duchy&#x27;s Jews were forbidden to immigrate into Prussia. Prussian policy, however, opened an exception, Germanized Jews were enfranchised as citizens and granted freedom of movement. So most adherents of the Yiddish culture Germanized themselves within a short period. Many traditional or newly established German language educational institutions were attended by local Jews who, equipped with Prussian education and German language skills, often emigrated to Prussia proper with some making their careers. Despite Germanization efforts, the Polish speaking population more than doubled to 1,344,000 and remained the majority, however, its percentage decreased to 64% of the population by 1910. However, there were regional differences, with Polish being the prevalent language in central, eastern and southern Posen, and German speakers constituted majorities in the north and west.

==Religion==
According to contemporary statistics of 1825 the population consisted of the 65.6% Roman Catholics, 28.1% Protestants and 6.3% Jews. The Roman Catholic congregations formed part of the Ecclesiastical Province of Gnesen-Posen led by the Primate of Poland, a Roman Catholic jurisdiction formed in 1821 by merging the archdiocese of Gniezno and Poznań. The bulk of the Lutheran and Reformed (Calvinist) congregations became part of the &quot;Ecclesiastical Province of Posen&quot; within the Evangelical Church in Prussia after 1817, with the congregations usually retaining their previous separate confessions. With the persisting resistance of some Lutherans against the administrative Prussian Union of churches, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Prussia emerged in 1841. It was recognized by the government in 1845, with about 3,000 Old Lutherans in several congregations spread across the area of the grand duchy. Jewish religious life was organised in about 130 congregations spread all over the grand duchy. Since the government tolerated Judaism, but did not recognise it, no Jewish umbrella organisation, comparable to those of the Christian denominations or the former Council of Four Lands, forbidden in 1764, did emerge in the grand duchy. The migration of Posen Jews to Prussia was mostly blocked until 1850, when they were finally naturalised.

==Territorial administration==
The monarch of the grand duchy, with title of Grand Duke of Posen, was the Hohenzollern king of Prussia and his representative was the Duke-Governor (Statthalter): the first was Prince Antoni Radziwiłł (1815–1831), who was married to Princess Louise of Prussia, the king&#x27;s cousin. The governor was assigned to give advice in matters of Polish nationality, and had the right to veto the administration decisions; in reality, however, all administrative power was in the hands of the Prussian upper-president of the province.

<doc id="378579" wikidata="Q834280" url="?curid=378579" title="Bupropion">
<text>Bupropion, formerly called amfebutamone, and sold under the brand name Wellbutrin among others, is an atypical antidepressant that is indicated in the treatment of major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder and to support smoking cessation. It is also popular as an add-on medication in the cases of &quot;incomplete response&quot; to the first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction, it is not associated with weight gain and sleepiness, and it is more effective than SSRIs at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue. Bupropion, particularly the immediate-release formulation, carries a higher risk of seizure than many other antidepressants, hence caution is recommended in patients with a history of seizure disorder. The medication is taken by mouth.
Common adverse effects of bupropion with the greatest difference from placebo are dry mouth, nausea, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, and excessive sweating. Raised blood pressure is notable. Rare but serious side effects include seizures, liver toxicity, psychosis, and risk of overdose. Bupropion use during pregnancy may be associated with increased likelihood of congenital heart defects.
Bupropion acts as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and a nicotinic receptor antagonist. However, its effects on dopamine are weak and clinical significance is contentious. Chemically, bupropion is an aminoketone that belongs to the class of substituted cathinones and more generally that of substituted amphetamines and substituted phenethylamines.
Bupropion was invented by Nariman Mehta, who worked at Burroughs Wellcome, in 1969. It was first approved for medical use in the United States in 1985. Bupropion was originally called by the generic name amfebutamone, before being renamed in 2000. In 2022, it was the 21st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 25million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination dextromethorphan/bupropion to serve as a rapid-acting antidepressant in patients with major depressive disorder.

== Medical uses ==
=== Depression ===
The evidence overall supports the effectiveness of bupropion over placebo for the treatment of depression. Some peer-reviewed studies suggest the quality of evidence is low. Some meta-analyses report that bupropion has an at-most small effect size for depression. One meta-analysis reported a large effect size. However, there were methodological limitations with this meta-analysis, including using a subset of only five trials for the effect size calculation, substantial variability in effect sizes between the selected trials—which led the authors to state that their findings in this area should be interpreted with &quot;extreme caution&quot;—and general lack of inclusion of unpublished trials in the meta-analysis. Unpublished trials are more likely to be negative in findings, and other meta-analyses have included unpublished trials. Evidence suggests that the effectiveness of bupropion for depression is similar to that of other antidepressants.

Over the autumn and winter months, bupropion prevents the development of depression in those who have recurring seasonal affective disorder: 15% of participants on bupropion experienced a major depressive episode vs. 27% of those on placebo. Bupropion also improves depression in bipolar disorder, with the efficacy and risk of an affective switch being similar to other antidepressants.

Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction, and the occurrence of sexual side effects is not different from placebo. Bupropion treatment is not associated with weight gain; on the contrary, the majority of studies observed significant weight loss in bupropion-treated participants. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness that may be produced by other antidepressants. Bupropion is more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue in depressed patients. Bupropion is effective in the treatment of anxious depression and, contrary to common belief, does not exacerbate anxiety in this context. The effectiveness of bupropion for anxious depression is equivalent to that of SSRIs in the case of depression with low or moderate anxiety, whereas SSRIs show a modest effectiveness advantage in terms of response rates for depression with high anxiety.

The addition of bupropion to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people do not respond to the SSRI, and it is supported by clinical trials; however, it appears to be inferior to the addition of atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole.

=== Smoking cessation ===
Prescribed as an aid for smoking cessation, bupropion reduces the severity of craving for nicotine and withdrawal symptoms such as depressed
mood, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and increased appetite. Initially, bupropion slows the weight gain that often occurs in the first weeks after quitting smoking. With time, however, this effect becomes negligible.

The bupropion treatment course lasts for seven to twelve weeks, with the patient halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. After the course, the effectiveness of bupropion for maintaining abstinence from smoking declines over time, from 37% of tobacco abstinence at 3 months to 20% at one year. It is unclear whether extending bupropion treatment helps to prevent relapse of smoking.

Overall, six months after the therapy, bupropion increases the likelihood of quitting smoking by approximately 1.6-fold as compared to placebo. In this respect, bupropion is as effective as nicotine replacement therapy but inferior to varenicline. Combining bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy does not improve the quitting rate.

In children and adolescents, the use of bupropion for smoking cessation does not appear to offer any significant benefits. The evidence for its use to aid smoking cessation in pregnant women is insufficient.

=== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ===
In the United States, the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not an approved indication of bupropion, and it is not mentioned in the 2019 guideline on ADHD treatment from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Systematic reviews of bupropion for the treatment of ADHD in both adults and children note that bupropion may be effective for ADHD but warn that this conclusion has to be interpreted with caution, because clinical trials were of low quality due to small sizes and risk of bias. Similarly to atomoxetine, bupropion has a delayed onset of action for ADHD, and several weeks of treatment are required for therapeutic effects. This is in contrast to stimulants, such as amphetamine and methylphenidate, which have an immediate onset of effect in the condition.

=== Sexual dysfunction ===
Bupropion is less likely than other antidepressants to cause sexual dysfunction. A range of studies indicate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants but can actually help to alleviate sexual dysfunction including sexual dysfunction induced by SSRI antidepressants. There have also been small studies suggesting that bupropion or a bupropion/trazodone combination may improve some measures of sexual function in women who have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) and are not depressed. According to an expert consensus recommendation from the International Society for the Study of Women&#x27;s Sexual Health, bupropion can be considered as an off-label treatment for HSDD despite limited safety and efficacy data. Likewise, a 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of bupropion for sexual desire disorder in women reported that although data were limited, bupropion appeared to be dose-dependently effective for the condition.

=== Weight loss ===
Bupropion, when used for treating long-term weight gain over six to twelve months, results in an average weight loss of over placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other weight-loss medications such as sibutramine or orlistat. The combination drug naltrexone/bupropion has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity.

=== Other uses ===
Bupropion is not effective in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but it is showing promise in reducing drug use in treating amphetamine-type stimulant use and cravings. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. The drug may be useful in the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and narcolepsy.

Bupropion has been used to treat disorders of diminished motivation, like apathy, abulia, and akinetic mutism. Accordingly, the drug has been found to increase effort expenditure and improve motivational deficits in animal models. However, only limited benefits of bupropion in the treatment of apathy have been observed in clinical trials in various conditions.

Bupropion has been used in the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).

=== Available forms ===
Bupropion is available as an oral tablet in several different formulations. It is mainly formulated as the hydrochloride salt but also as the hydrobromide salt. In addition to single-drug formulations, bupropion is formulated in combinations including naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave) for obesity and dextromethorphan/bupropion (Auvelity) for depression.

== Contraindications ==
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescription label advises that bupropion should not be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or benzodiazepine or alcohol withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents, and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.

== Side effects ==
The common adverse effects of bupropion with the greatest difference from placebo are dry mouth, nausea, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, and excessive sweating. Bupropion has the highest incidence of insomnia of all second-generation antidepressants, apart from desvenlafaxine. It is also associated with about 20% increased risk of headache.

Bupropion raises blood pressure in some people. One study showed an average rise of 6 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure in 10% of patients. The prescribing information notes that hypertension, sometimes severe, is observed in some people taking bupropion, both with and without pre-existing hypertension. The safety of bupropion in people with cardiovascular conditions and its general cardiovascular safety profile remains unclear due to the lack of data.

Seizure is a rare but serious adverse effect of bupropion. It is strongly dose-dependent: for the immediate release preparation, the seizure incidence is 0.4% at the dose 300–450 mg per day; the incidence climbs almost ten-fold for the higher than recommended dose of 600 mg. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07–0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally 0–0.5% at the recommended doses.

Cases of liver toxicity leading to death or liver transplantation have been reported for bupropion. It is considered to be one of several antidepressants with a greater risk of hepatotoxicity.

The prescribing information warns about bupropion triggering an angle-closure glaucoma attack. On the other hand, bupropion may decrease the risk of development of open angle glaucoma.

Bupropion use by mothers in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with a 23% increase in the odds of congenital heart defects in their children.

Bupropion has rarely been associated with instances of Stevens–Johnson syndrome.

Bupropion has not been associated with QT prolongation at therapeutic doses but has been associated with QT prolongation in overdose.

=== Psychiatric ===
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, to carry a boxed warning stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in people younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo.

Bupropion prescribed for smoking cessation results in a 25% increase in the risk of psychiatric side effects, in particular, anxiety (about 40% increase) and insomnia (about 80% increase). The evidence is insufficient to determine whether bupropion is associated with suicides or suicidal behavior.

In rare cases, bupropion-induced psychosis may develop. It is associated with higher doses of bupropion; many cases described are at higher than recommended doses. Concurrent antipsychotic medication appears to be protective. In most cases the psychotic symptoms are eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing treatment or adding antipsychotic medication.

Although studies are lacking, a handful of case reports suggest that abrupt discontinuation of bupropion may cause antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.

== Overdose ==
Bupropion is considered moderately dangerous in overdose. According to an analysis of US National Poison Data System, adjusted for the number of prescriptions, bupropion and venlafaxine are the two new generation antidepressants (that is excluding tricyclic antidepressants) that result in the highest mortality and morbidity. For significant overdoses, seizures have been reported in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, having had multiple uncontrolled seizures and myocardial infarction.

== Interactions ==
Since bupropion is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the enzyme CYP2B6, drug interactions with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes such medications as paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine (active metabolite of fluoxetine), diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected result is an increase of bupropion and a decrease in hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John&#x27;s wort, and phenobarbital. Indeed, carbamazepine decreases exposure to bupropion by 90% and increases exposure to hydroxybupropion by 94%. Ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and efavirenz have been shown to decrease levels of bupropion and/or its metabolites. Ticlopidine and clopidogrel, both potent CYP2B6 inhibitors, have been found to considerably increase bupropion levels as well as decrease levels of its metabolite hydroxybupropion.

Bupropion and its metabolites are inhibitors of CYP2D6, with hydroxybupropion responsible for most of the inhibition. Additionally, bupropion and its metabolites may decrease the expression of CYP2D6 in the liver. The end effect is a significant slowing of the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. For instance, bupropion has been found to increase area-under-the-curve of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, by 5-fold. Bupropion has also been found to increase levels of atomoxetine by 5.1-fold, while decreasing the exposure to its main metabolite by 1.5-fold. As another example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300 mg/day bupropion. When people on bupropion are given MDMA, about 30% increase of exposure to both drugs is observed, with enhanced mood but decreased heart rate effects of MDMA. Interactions with other CYP2D6 substrates, such as metoprolol, imipramine, nortriptyline, venlafaxine, and nebivolol have also been reported. However, in a notable exception, bupropion does not seem to affect the concentrations of CYP2D6 substrates fluoxetine and paroxetine. Bupropion prevents norepinephrine and dopamine release induced by amphetamines and has been found to reduce the subjective and sympathomimetic effects of methamphetamine in humans.

Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold, and therefore can potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids. The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance.

Caution should be observed when combining bupropion with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), as it may result in hypertensive crisis.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Pharmacodynamics ===
The mechanism of action of bupropion in the treatment of depression and for other indications is unclear. However, it is thought to be related to the fact that bupropion is a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and negative allosteric modulator of several nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Bupropion does not act as a norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent. Pharmacological actions of bupropion, to a substantial degree, are due to its active metabolites hydroxybupropion, &quot;threo&quot;-hydrobupropion, and &quot;erythro&quot;-hydrobupropion that are present in the blood plasma at comparable or much higher levels. In fact, bupropion could accurately be conceptualized as a prodrug of these metabolites. Overall action of these metabolites, and particularly one enantiomer &quot;S,S&quot;-hydroxybupropion, is also characterized by inhibition of norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake and nicotinic inhibition (see the chart on the right). Bupropion has no meaningful direct activity at a variety of receptors, including α- and β-adrenergic, dopamine, serotonin, histamine, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.

The occupancy of dopamine transporter (DAT) by bupropion (300mg/day) and its metabolites in the human brain as measured by several positron emission tomography (PET) studies is approximately 20%, with a mean occupancy range of about 14 to 26%. For comparison, the NDRI methylphenidate at therapeutic doses is thought to occupy greater than 50% of DAT sites. In accordance with its low DAT occupancy, no measurable dopamine release in the human brain was detected with bupropion (one 150mg dose) in a PET study. Bupropion has also been shown to increase striatal VMAT2, though it is unknown if this effect is more pronounced than other DRIs. These findings raise questions about the role of dopamine reuptake inhibition in the pharmacology of bupropion, and suggest that other actions may be responsible for its therapeutic effects. No data are available on occupancy of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) by bupropion and its metabolites. However, due to the increased exposure of hydroxybupropion over bupropion itself, which has higher affinity for the NET than the DAT, bupropion&#x27;s overall pharmacological profile in humans may end up making it effectively more of a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor than a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Accordingly, the clinical effects of bupropion are more consistent with noradrenergic activity than with dopaminergic actions.

Bupropion has been claimed to be a sigma σ1 receptor agonist. Its antidepressant-like effects in rodents depend on σ1 receptor activation. They are enhanced and inhibited by σ1 receptor agonists and antagonists, respectively. However, no data on the binding or functional effects of bupropion at the human sigma receptors seem to be available. In any case, bupropion has been reported to bind to rodent σ1 receptors with values of 580 to 2,100nM. In contrast to many other phenethylamines and amphetamines, bupropion is not an agonist of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1).

Bupropion has been found to have a mixture of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory activity through modulation of the immune system. One such mechanism underlying these effects may be reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). The catecholaminergic actions of bupropion may be involved in its immunomodulatory effects.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
After oral administration, bupropion is rapidly and completely absorbed reaching the peak blood plasma concentration after 1.5 hours (tmax). Sustained-release (SR) and extended-release (XL) formulations have been designed to slow down absorption resulting in tmax of 3 hours and 5 hours, respectively. Absolute bioavailability of bupropion is unknown but is presumed to be low, at 5–20%, due to the first-pass metabolism. As for the relative bioavailability of the formulations, XL formulation has lower bioavailability (68%) compared to SR formulation and immediate release bupropion.

Bupropion is metabolized in the body by a variety of pathways. The oxidative pathways are by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2B6 leading to &quot;R,R&quot;- and &quot;S,S&quot;-hydroxybupropion and, to a lesser degree, CYP2C19 leading to 4&#x27;-hydroxybupropion. The reductive pathways are by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 in the liver and AKR7A2/AKR7A3 in the intestine leading to &quot;threo&quot;-hydrobupropion and by yet unknown enzyme leading to &quot;erythro&quot;-hydrobupropion.

The metabolism of bupropion is highly variable: the effective doses of bupropion received by persons who ingest the same amount of the drug may differ by as much as 5.5 times (with a half-life of 12–30 hours), while the effective doses of hydroxybupropion may differ by as much as 7.5 times (with a half-life of 15–25 hours). Based on this, some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion.

The metabolism of bupropion also seems to follow biphasic pharmacokinetics: the redistribution alpha phase with half-life of about 1 hour precedes the metabolism beta phase of about 12-30 hours. This might explain why abuse is unfeasible due to a short &quot;high&quot;, as well as support the use of extended-release formulas to maintain a consistent concentration of bupropion.

The metabolism of bupropion is highly species-dependent. As an example, oral bupropion results in hydroxybupropion levels that are 16-fold higher than those of bupropion itself in humans, whereas in rats, oral bupropion results in levels of bupropion that are 3.4-fold higher than those of hydroxybupropion. The species-dependent metabolism of bupropion is thought to be involved in species differences in its pharmacodynamic effects. For example, bupropion produces psychostimulant-like and reinforcing effects in rodents, whereas oral bupropion at therapeutic doses seems to have much less or no potential for such effects in humans.

== Chemistry ==
Bupropion is an aminoketone that belongs to the class of substituted cathinones and the more general class of substituted phenethylamines. It is also known structurally as 3-chloro-&quot;N&quot;-&quot;tert&quot;-butyl-β-keto-α-methylphenethylamine, 3-chloro-&quot;N&quot;-&quot;tert&quot;-butyl-β-ketoamphetamine, or 3-chloro-&quot;N&quot;-&quot;tert&quot;-butylcathinone. The clinically used bupropion is racemic, which is a mixture of two enantiomers: &quot;S&quot;-bupropion and &quot;R&quot;-bupropion. Although the optical isomers on bupropion can be separated, they rapidly racemize under physiological conditions.

Bupropion is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C13H18ClNO and a molecular weight of 239.74g/mol. It is a highly lipophilic compound, with an experimental log P of 3.6. Pharmaceutically, bupropion is used mainly as the hydrochloride salt but also to a lesser extent as the hydrobromide salt.

A number of analogues of bupropion exist, such as hydroxybupropion, radafaxine, and manifaxine, among others. These compounds are norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) similarly to bupropion. The analogues of bupropion with the &quot;N&quot;-&quot;tert&quot;-butyl group removed or replaced with an &quot;N&quot;-methyl group, 3-chlorocathinone (3-CC) and 3-chloromethcathinone (3-CMC; clophedrone), respectively, are potent serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agents (SNDRAs). They have been encountered as cathinone designer and recreational drugs.

There have been reported cases of false-positive urine amphetamine tests in persons taking bupropion.

=== Synthesis ===
It is synthesized in two chemical steps starting from 3&#x27;-chloro-propiophenone. The alpha position adjacent to the ketone is first brominated followed by nucleophilic displacement of the resulting alpha-bromoketone with &quot;t&quot;-butylamine and treated with hydrochloric acid to give bupropion as the hydrochloride salt in 75–85% overall yield.
== History ==
Bupropion was invented by Nariman Mehta of Burroughs Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) in 1969, and the US patent for it was granted in 1974. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antidepressant on 30 December 1985, and marketed under the name Wellbutrin. However, a significant incidence of seizures at the originally recommended dosage (400–600 mg/day) caused the withdrawal of the drug in 1986. Subsequently, the risk of seizures was found to be highly dose-dependent, and bupropion was re-introduced to the market in 1989 with a lower maximum recommended daily dose of 450 mg/day.

In 1996, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a sustained-release formulation of alcohol-resistant bupropion called Wellbutrin SR, intended to be taken twice a day (as compared with three times a day for immediate-release Wellbutrin). In 2003, the FDA approved another sustained-release formulation called Wellbutrin XL, intended for once-daily dosing. Wellbutrin SR and XL are available in generic form in the United States and Canada. In 1997, bupropion was approved by the FDA for use as a smoking cessation aid under the name Zyban. In 2006, Wellbutrin XL was similarly approved as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder.

In October 2007, two providers of consumer information on nutritional products and supplements, ConsumerLab.com and The People&#x27;s Pharmacy, released the results of comparative tests of different brands of bupropion. The People&#x27;s Pharmacy received multiple reports of increased side effects and decreased efficacy of generic bupropion, which prompted it to ask ConsumerLab.com to test the products in question. The tests showed that &quot;one of a few generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, sold as Budeprion XL 300 mg, didn&#x27;t perform the same as the brand-name pill in the lab.&quot; The FDA investigated these complaints and concluded that Budeprion XL is equivalent to Wellbutrin XL in regard to bioavailability of bupropion and its main active metabolite hydroxybupropion. The FDA also said that coincidental natural mood variation is the most likely explanation for the apparent worsening of depression after the switch from Wellbutrin XL to Budeprion XL. On 3 October 2012, however, the FDA reversed this opinion, announcing that &quot;Budeprion XL 300 mg fails to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to Wellbutrin XL 300 mg.&quot; The FDA did not test the bioequivalence of any of the other generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, but requested that the four manufacturers submit data on this question to the FDA by March 2013. the FDA has made determinations on the formulations from some manufacturers not being bioequivalent.

In April 2008, the FDA approved a formulation of bupropion as a hydrobromide salt instead of a hydrochloride salt, to be sold under the name Aplenzin by Sanofi-Aventis.

In 2009, the FDA issued a health advisory warning that the prescription of bupropion for smoking cessation has been associated with reports of unusual behavior changes, agitation, and hostility. Some people, according to the advisory, have become depressed or have had their depression worsen, have had thoughts about suicide or dying, or have attempted suicide. This advisory was based on a review of anti-smoking products that identified 75 reports of &quot;suicidal adverse events&quot; for bupropion over ten years. Based on the results of follow-up trials this warning was removed in 2016.

In 2012, the US Justice Department announced that GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3 billion fine, in part for promoting the unapproved use of Wellbutrin for weight loss and sexual dysfunction.

In 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended suspending a number of nationally approved medicines due to misrepresentation of bioequivalence study data by Micro Therapeutic Research Labs in India. The products recommended for suspension included several 300 mg modified-release bupropion tablets.

Following EMA&#x27;s call for an industry-wide review of medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines, GlaxoSmithKline paused batch release and distribution of bupropion 150 mg tablets in November 2022. In July 2023, EMA raised the acceptable daily intake of nitrosamine impurities, leading GlaxoSmithKline to announce that distribution of bupropion 150 mg tablets would resume &quot;across the EU and Europe&quot; by the end of 2023.

== Society and culture ==

=== Recreational use ===
While bupropion demonstrates some potential for misuse, this potential is less than that of other commonly used stimulants, being limited by features of its pharmacology. Case reports describe the misuse of bupropion as producing a &quot;high&quot; similar to cocaine or amphetamine usage but with less intensity. Bupropion misuse is uncommon. There have been some anecdotal and case-study reports of bupropion abuse, but the bulk of evidence indicates that the subjective effects of bupropion when taken orally are markedly different from those of addictive stimulants such as cocaine or amphetamine. However, bupropion, by non-conventional routes of administration like injection or insufflation, has been reported to be misused in the United States and Canada, notably in prisons.

=== Legal status ===
In Russia bupropion is banned as a narcotic drug, due to it being a derivative of methcathinone.
In Australia, France, and the UK, smoking cessation is the only licensed use of bupropion, and no generics are marketed.

=== Brand names ===
Brand names include Wellbutrin, Aplenzin, Budeprion, Buproban, buprapan, Forfivo, Voxra, Zyban, Bupron, Bupisure, Bupep, Smoquite, Elontril, Oribion and Buxon.

== Research ==
Bupropion has been studied limitedly in the treatment of social anxiety disorder.

<text>Obelia is a genus of hydrozoans, a class of mainly marine and some freshwater animal species that have both polyp and medusa stages in their life cycle. Hydrozoa belongs to the phylum Cnidaria, which are aquatic (mainly marine) organisms that are relatively simple in structure with a diameter around 1mm. There are currently 120 known species, with more to be discovered. These species are grouped into three broad categories: &quot;O. bidentata&quot;, &quot;O. dichotoma&quot;, and &quot;O. geniculata&quot;. &quot;O. longissima&quot; was later accepted as a legitimate species, but taxonomy regarding the entire genus is debated over.

&quot;Obelia&quot; is also called sea fur.

&quot;Obelia&quot; has a worldwide distribution except the high-Arctic and Antarctic seas. and a stage of &quot;Obelia&quot; species are common in coastal and offshore plankton around the world. &quot;Obelia&quot; are usually found no deeper than from the water&#x27;s surface, growing in intertidal rock pools and at the extreme low water of spring tides.

==Life cycle==
The polyp colony reproduces asexually. During this stage of life, &quot;Obelia&quot; are confined to substrate surfaces. In mature colonies there are individual hydranths called gastrozooids, which can be found expanded or contracted, to aid in the growth of this organism by feeding. The reproductive polyp gonozooids have medusa buds. These medusa buds differentiate Obelia from others in the family Campanulariidae because development begins from a bud within the gonotheca. Eventually the buds are lost, and subsequent development shares resemblances with other hydranths. Other hydranths are specialized for defense. The main stalky body of the colony is composed of a &quot;coenosarc&quot;, which is covered by a protective &quot;perisarc&quot;.

The next generation of the life cycle begins when the medusae are released from the gonozooids, producing free swimming male only medusae velum with gonads, a mouth, and tentacles. The physical appearance of the male and female medusae velum, including their gonads, are indistinguishable, and the sex can only be determined by observing the inside of the gonads, which will either contain sperm or eggs. The medusae reproduce sexually, releasing sperm and eggs that fertilize to form a zygote, which later morphs into a blastula, then a ciliated swimming larva called a planula.

The planulae are free-swimming for a while but eventually attach themselves to some solid surface, where they begin their reproductive phase of life. Once attached to a substrate, a planula quickly develops into one feeding polyp. As the polyp grows, it begins developing branches of other feeding individuals, thus forming a new generation of polyps by asexual budding.

==Structure==
Through its life cycle, &quot;Obelia&quot; take on two forms: polyp and medusa. They are diploblastic, with two true tissue layers—an epidermis (ectodermis) and a gastrodermis (endodermis)—with a jelly-like mesoglea filling the area between the two true tissue layers. They carry a nerve net with no brain or ganglia. A gastrovascular cavity is present where the digestion starts and later becomes intracellular. They have incomplete digestive tracts where the food enters, is digested, and expelled through the same opening. Scientists are trying to pinpoint their food preferences, but experiments have shown Obelia feeding on crustaceans under lab conditions, and ciliates. Some species of Obelia are known ingest tintinnids and microplanktonic sex through grazers. During the polyp stage, the mouth is situated at the top of the body, surrounded by tentacles, whereas during the medusa stage, the mouth is situated at the distal end of the main body structure. Four gonads lie in this main body structure, or &quot;manubrium&quot;. Food is caught with the tentacles, then directed to the manubrium; sometimes food lands directly onto the manubrium and is consumed that way. The food is then distributed through a canal system, consisting of four radial canals and an outer ring. Defense and the capture of prey are helped by unique stinging cells called cnidocytes that contain &quot;nematocysts&quot; triggered by the &quot;cnidocil&quot;. It has a ridge-like structure on the inner margin, called a velum. If the velum is present, it is called a craspedote medusa.

== Phylogeny ==
Estimates of divergence times and distinctive haplotypes provide evidence of glacial refugia around Iceland and southeastern Canada. In one study, &quot;O. geniculata&quot; was first documented in these areas in the 1990s but were later found in Massachusetts and Japan in the 2000s. There are three reciprocally monophyletic clades of Obelia, one branch for the North Atlantic, one for Japan, and one for New Zealand. There seems to be an ancestral haplotype that occurs in the North Atlantic populations from Massachusetts, New Brunswick, and Iceland&quot;.&quot; The population from Woods Hole, MA shows less genetic diversity than the New Brunswick population. The more recent expansion of these haplotypes demonstrates the southward movement of hydroid populations, possibly due to climate change. The North Atlantic populations contain ancestral haplotypes, which differ from the populations in Japan and New Zealand. Pacific populations have more haplotype diversity than all four of the North Atlantic populations, which indicates that the North Atlantic population is more recently established than the Pacific population. The minimum estimated age of the New Brunswick population is between 47 and 143 thousand years old. Including the Massachusetts population, this number is between 82 and 150 thousand years, but Iceland has the oldest estimated population with the minimum age ranging from 68 to 204 thousand years old.

&quot;Obelia&quot; are distinguishable from others in &quot;Campanulariidae&quot; from their size in length and diameter, as well as their smaller hydrothecal cusps and relatively thinner perisarc thickness. Some morphological traits are hard to distinguish across species, so observing a combination of these traits will help with identification. Other useful observable characteristics are branching pattern of colonies and length of trophosome. There are variations and exceptions to these, which makes identification even more difficult. &quot;O. geniculata&quot; is characterized by a thicker perisarc with more variation that other species of &quot;Obelia. O. longissima&quot; have longer first and second order branches, in addition to a greater variation in hydrothecal cusp length than others in the genus. &quot;O. bidentata&quot; differs from the previous species due to their more cylindrical and longer hydrothecal cusps.

<doc id="378595" wikidata="Q846091" url="?curid=378595" title="President of Angola">
<text>The president of Angola () is both head of state and head of government in Angola. According to the constitution adopted in 2010, the post of prime minister is abolished; executive authority belongs to the president who has also a degree of legislative power, as he can govern by decree. 

The position of president dates from Angola&#x27;s independence from Portugal. Agostinho Neto obtained the position when his People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) won control of the country from the Portuguese. When Neto died in 1979, José Eduardo dos Santos succeeded him. 

Under Dos Santos&#x27; leadership, Angola became a multi-party state, although it remained controlled by him. The election held in 1992 reelected Dos Santos with 49% of the votes. His opponent, Jonas Savimbi of the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) party, claimed that the election was fraudulent.

As of 2021, there is a two-term limit for the president in the Constitution of Angola. The term limit has not been met by any president yet. 

The Angolan president is elected by double simultaneous first-past-the-post voting for the same five-year term as the assembly, renewable once. Each participating party nominates a candidate as top of its list, who must be clearly identified on the ballot paper. The top candidate of the party gathering the most votes is elected President in accordance with the 2010 Constitution. The new constitution limits a president to serving two terms, although it does not count the terms served to date, and abolishes the post of prime minister, instead introducing the post of vice-president.

João Lourenço is the current incumbent. He ascended to power on 26 September 2017.

<doc id="378597" wikidata="Q918347" url="?curid=378597" title="Danny Ainge">
<text>Daniel Ray Ainge ( ; born March 17, 1959) is an American former professional basketball player, coach, and professional baseball player who serves as an executive for the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA). During his 18-year career as general manager for the Boston Celtics, Ainge was known for making bold moves to help the team rebuild, and clearing cap space. He served as the Celtics&#x27; president of basketball operations from 2003 until his retirement in 2021.

A three-sport star in high school, Ainge was named to All-America teams in football, basketball, and baseball. At Brigham Young University, he was named national basketball college player of the year and won the John R. Wooden Award for the most outstanding male college basketball player. While in college, Ainge also played parts of three seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB), mostly as a second baseman. He was then drafted into the NBA by the Celtics in 1981. Ainge played in the NBA for 14 seasons, playing for the Celtics, Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, and Phoenix Suns, primarily as a shooting guard. He went on to coach the Suns for three seasons before joining management of the Celtics, with whom Ainge has three NBA championships to his credit (two as a player, one as a team executive). During his playing career, Ainge appeared in the 1988 All-Star Game. He was the NBA Executive of the Year in 2008.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Eugene, Oregon, Ainge was a multi-sport star at North Eugene High School. He led the Highlanders&#x27; basketball team to consecutive AAA state titles in 1976 and 1977, earning all-state honors both years, and was considered one of the top football recruits in Oregon at wide receiver. As a junior, Ainge was named to the 1977 &quot;Parade&quot; High School All-America team, and is the only person in history to be a high school first team All-American in football, basketball, and baseball.

== College career ==

Ainge played college basketball at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. He hit one of the best-known shots in the 1981 NCAA tournament, against Notre Dame in Atlanta in the Sweet Sixteen, when his coast-to-coast drive and lay-up with two seconds remaining gave the Cougars a one-point win. Ainge concluded his senior year by winning the Eastman Award, as well as the John R. Wooden Award—given to the best collegiate player in the nation. During his four-year career at BYU, Ainge was an All-American, a two-time First Team Academic All-American, the WAC Player of the Year and a four-time All-WAC selection. He concluded his college career having scored in double figures in 112 consecutive games, an NCAA record at that time.

==Baseball career==
=== Toronto Blue Jays (1979–1981) ===
Ainge was selected in baseball&#x27;s 1977 amateur draft by the Toronto Blue Jays. He made it to the major leagues with the Blue Jays in while still in college. Mostly a second baseman, Ainge played third base and outfield positions as well, hitting .220 in his baseball career with two home runs and 146 hits in 211 games. Ainge is the second-youngest player in Blue Jays history to hit a home run, at 20 years and 77 days, surpassed only by Vladimir Guerrero Jr.

After three years with the Blue Jays, Ainge decided to pursue a career in basketball and was drafted by the Boston Celtics in the second round (31st overall) of the 1981 NBA draft, who had to buy out Ainge&#x27;s contract from the Blue Jays after a legal battle.

Ainge is one of 13 athletes who have played in the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball, along with Frank Baumholtz, Hank Biasatti, Gene Conley, Chuck Connors, Dave DeBusschere, Dick Groat, Steve Hamilton, 
Mark Hendrickson, Cotton Nash, Ron Reed, Dick Ricketts, and Howie Schultz.

==Basketball career==
=== Boston Celtics (1981–1989) ===
Not everything went well for Ainge in NBA basketball at first. He had a terrible first day of practice, &quot;shooting 0–2,547&quot;, Larry Bird wrote in his autobiography &quot;Drive: The Story of My Life.&quot; Celtics head coach Bill Fitch gave Ainge a rough time, saying his batting average was better than his shooting percentage on the basketball court. But Ainge became an important player for the Celtics teams that won NBA titles in 1984 and 1986.

Ainge played sparingly during his rookie season (1981–82), but broke into the starting lineup in his second year, averaging 9.9 points per game. However, new coach K.C. Jones moved Ainge back to the bench in his third season (1983–84), starting Gerald Henderson instead. Ainge remained an important role player off the bench, helping the Celtics defeat the rival Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals that year. The Celtics traded Henderson to Seattle in the off-season, returning Ainge to the starting guard position opposite Dennis Johnson. Ainge responded by averaging 12.9 points and 5.3 assists per game in 1984–85. He remained a starter for the Celtics for most of the next five seasons. The Celtics won the championship again in 1985–86; that team is widely considered to be one of the greatest in NBA history. In 1986–87, Ainge finished second in the NBA in free throw shooting (89.7%) and third in 3-point shooting (44.3%). The following year, he made 148 3-pointers, shattering the previous NBA single-season record of 92 held by Darrell Griffith of the Utah Jazz. Ainge made his only appearance in the NBA All-Star Game that year, scoring 12 points.

=== Sacramento Kings (1989–1990) ===
In 1989, Ainge was traded to the Sacramento Kings, along with Brad Lohaus, for young center Joe Kleine (whom the Celtics saw as a possible successor to the aging Robert Parish) and Ed Pinckney. Now a featured player on a team with no superstars, Ainge averaged 20.3 points and 6.7 assists per game in that half-season with the Kings. He scored 45 points for the Kings in a loss to the Golden State Warriors, matching a career high that he had set just a few months prior against the Philadelphia 76ers while still playing for the Celtics at that time.

=== Portland Trail Blazers (1990–1992) ===
In 1990, Ainge was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for Byron Irvin and draft picks. Being a native of Oregon, he was considered a hometown favorite by Blazers fans. On May 5, 1992, Ainge played an important role in the highest scoring NBA postseason game of all time, scoring 25 points and hitting multiple key shots during a 155–153 double overtime win over the Phoenix Suns. The win gave the Blazers a three games to one game lead in the Western Conference Semifinals. Ainge would go on to help the Blazers reach the 1992 NBA Finals, but they would succumb to the Chicago Bulls in six games. On June 5, he scored nine points in the extra period to tie an all-time NBA record for most points in an overtime during a finals game.

=== Phoenix Suns (1992–1995) ===
After the 1991–92 season, Ainge became a free agent. He had stated in media interviews that he ideally wanted to stay in Portland and would contact Blazers management before seriously entertaining offers from other teams. However, on July 1, 1992, Ainge signed a contract with the Phoenix Suns on his first day of free agency. Ainge averaged 11.8 points per game as the Suns went 62–20 that year and reached the NBA finals, where they lost to the Bulls in six games.

On January 18, 1994, he became the second player in NBA history to hit 900 three-point shots (he made 1,002 three-pointers for his career), and he scored 11,964 points for an average of 11.5 points per game, 2,768 rebounds for an average of 2.7, and 4,199 assists, an average of four per game, over 1,042 NBA games.

Ainge retired after the 1994–95 season. At the time of his retirement, he had the highest personal winning percentage in NBA history among players with at least 1,000 career games, edging out Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 69.0% to 68.8%. Ainge was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1999.

===Reputation===
Throughout his playing career, Ainge was known as a brash, hard-nosed player. In a 1983 playoff game against the Atlanta Hawks, he called Tree Rollins a &quot;sissy&quot;, whereupon Rollins elbowed Ainge in the face. Ainge tackled Rollins and the two began wrestling. Rollins bit Ainge&#x27;s middle finger so hard that it required two stitches to keep the tendon together. Ainge was ejected from the contest for starting the fight. The incident prompted the headline &quot;Tree Bites Man&quot; on the April 25, 1983, &quot;Boston Herald&quot;. While playing for the Phoenix Suns in the 1993 season, Ainge got into a tussle with Michael Jordan at midcourt; both were given a technical foul. In a 1994 postseason game, Ainge rifled an inbounding pass at the head of Houston Rockets guard Mario Elie, striking him in the face and snapping his neck back. Ainge is still known to some as &quot;The Moaning Mormon&quot;.

==Coaching career==
Ainge rejoined the Phoenix Suns as an assistant to head coach Cotton Fitzsimmons in May 1996. On November 14, 1996, Fitzsimmons retired after the Suns started the season with an 0–8 record and Ainge was appointed as his replacement. During his first season coaching the Suns, Ainge got into an on-court altercation with player Robert Horry, which led to Horry throwing a towel at Ainge afterward. This incident eventually forced the Suns to trade Horry to the Los Angeles Lakers for Ainge&#x27;s old teammate Cedric Ceballos. Despite early struggles, Ainge would lead the Suns into the 1997 NBA playoffs after they started the season with a 0–13 record.

On December 14, 1999, Ainge resigned as head coach of the Suns; he cited a need to spend more time with his family. Ainge had accumulated a 136–90 record during his stint as head coach. Ainge was replaced by assistant coach Scott Skiles.

==Executive career==
===Boston Celtics executive===
In 2003, Ainge was hired as the executive director of Basketball Operations for the Celtics. He has often been controversial in his role as a Celtics executive, trading popular players such as three-time All-Star Antoine Walker (earning himself the nickname &quot;Trader Danny&quot;) and having personality conflicts with then-head coach Jim O&#x27;Brien (which eventually led to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s departure to the Philadelphia 76ers). However, Ainge kept the support of both the Celtics&#x27; ownership group and—perhaps most importantly—legendary former head coach Red Auerbach, who was employed by the team as a &quot;senior assistant&quot; until his death in October 2006.

The 2006–07 Celtics finished with a 24–58 record, second-worst in the team&#x27;s history. Following the season, Paul Pierce, team captain and face of the franchise, expressed frustration with the team&#x27;s failures. He requested a trade to a contender if management were unable to acquire veteran talent of Pierce&#x27;s caliber.

Ainge responded with two bold moves that changed the franchise&#x27;s fortunes almost overnight: the 2007 trades for the Minnesota Timberwolves&#x27; Kevin Garnett and the Seattle SuperSonics&#x27; Ray Allen immediately returned the Celtics to the ranks of the NBA&#x27;s elite franchises for the first time since the early 1990s. Together with Pierce, they formed a new &quot;Big Three&quot; and led the Celtics to the NBA&#x27;s best record (66–16) during the 2007–08 season. It was the most dramatic single-season improvement in league history (42 wins more than the previous year), and it earned Ainge the NBA Executive of the Year Award.

Boston faced the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2008 NBA Finals, renewing the long rivalry between the two teams. The Celtics won in six games, giving the franchise its 17th NBA championship. Ainge held the trophy for the first time since winning in 1986. In October 2008, after the Celtics&#x27; championship season, he was promoted to President of Basketball Operations.

On May 3, 2010, Ainge was fined $25,000 for tossing a towel to distract then Cleveland Cavaliers forward JJ Hickson shooting a free throw during Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals.

In 2013, Ainge traded Garnett and Pierce, along with Jason Terry and D.J. White, to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for five players plus the Nets&#x27; first-round picks in 2014, 2016, and 2018. Boston also received the rights to swap picks with Brooklyn in 2017. It is widely considered one of the most lopsided trades in league history, in favor of the Celtics, as the players from the trade became franchise cornerstones Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. The trade would ultimately be instrumental in helping the Celtics win the 2024 NBA Finals long after Ainge left the team.

On August 22, 2017, Ainge made another blockbuster deal, trading All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas, as well as Jae Crowder, Ante Žižić and the rights to the Nets&#x27; 2018 first-round draft pick, to the Cleveland Cavaliers for All-Star Kyrie Irving. Eight days later, the deal also included a 2020 second round pick from the Miami Heat as compensation relating to a prior injury to Thomas. This move, however, wouldn&#x27;t be as successful for the Celtics by comparison, as Irving would eventually leave the Celtics for the Brooklyn Nets after two seasons of play for them. Irving would, however, later play for the Celtics&#x27; opponents in the 2024 NBA Finals, the Dallas Mavericks.

On June 2, 2021, Ainge announced his retirement and named head coach Brad Stevens as his replacement as President of Basketball Operations. Ainge helped return the Celtics to the status of consistent contenders, guiding the team to 15 playoff appearances in 18 seasons at the helm after the team had only reached the postseason four times in 11 years prior to his arrival.

===Utah Jazz executive===
On December 15, 2021, Ainge was hired as the CEO of basketball operations and alternate governor of the Utah Jazz.

Ainge&#x27;s first transaction was hiring the new head coach Will Hardy after Quin Snyder announced his resignation as head coach. In the 2022 NBA offseason, Ainge traded Rudy Gobert to Minnesota and Donovan Mitchell to Cleveland. In return of these two major trades, the Jazz received Lauri Markkanen, Collin Sexton (via sign-and-trade), Malik Beasley, Jarred Vanderbilt, rights to the 14th and the 22nd picks (Ochai Agbaji and Walker Kessler) respectively, seven first round picks and four first round pick swaps. Ainge&#x27;s third move was at the 2023 Trade Deadline. To clear cap space, he traded Mike Conley to Minnesota, and Malik Beasley and Jarred Vanderbilt to the Lakers. In return, the Jazz received Russell Westbrook (who later bought out the contract to sign with the Clippers), Juan Toscano-Anderson, Damian Jones and a 2027 first round pick. Ainge also signed young prospects Kris Dunn, Luka Samanic, and Vernon Carey Jr.

==Other pursuits==
In 1996, Ainge made an appearance in the sports comedy film &quot;Space Jam&quot;, playing himself while as a member of the Phoenix Suns. While only a brief appearance, Ainge was dubbed &quot;The Bad Shot Guy&quot; after catching and shooting the ball at the same time while Charles Barkley roamed the court after having his skills stolen by the Monstars.

While a player with the Suns, Ainge opened a national chain of hat stores which he has since sold. Ainge has volunteered at a number of charitable organizations. Ainge also served as a commentator for the &quot;NBA on TNT&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ainge and his wife, Michelle, reside in Wellesley, Massachusetts; they have six children, one of whom, Austin, is director of player personnel for the Boston Celtics and like his father, played basketball at BYU. Ainge&#x27;s grandson, Dre also lives in Wellesley.

Ainge&#x27;s nephew, Erik Ainge, was the starting quarterback on the football team at the University of Tennessee and was selected by the New York Jets in the 5th round of the 2008 NFL draft. Another nephew, Jake Toolson, played the shooting guard position for BYU and signed an Exhibit-10 contract with the Utah Jazz in 2020.

Ainge and his family are active members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in which Ainge served as a bishop.

Ainge had a mild heart attack in 2009,
and another in 2019. He has ADHD, according to a personality test Ainge took when Doc Rivers was coaching the Celtics.

<text>A tunicate is an exclusively marine invertebrate animal, a member of the subphylum Tunicata ( ). This grouping is part of the Chordata, a phylum which includes all animals with dorsal nerve cords and notochords (including vertebrates). The subphylum was at one time called Urochordata, and the term urochordates is still sometimes used for these animals.

Despite their simple appearance and very different adult form, their close relationship to the vertebrates is certain. Both groups are chordates, as evidenced by the fact that during their mobile larval stage, tunicates possess a notochord, a hollow dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, post-anal tail, and an endostyle. They resemble a tadpole.

Tunicates are the only chordates that have lost their myomeric segmentation, with the possible exception of the seriation of the gill slits. However, doliolids still display segmentation of the muscle bands.

Some tunicates live as solitary individuals, but others replicate by budding and become colonies, each unit being known as a zooid. They are marine filter feeders with a water-filled, sac-like body structure and two tubular openings, known as siphons, through which they draw in and expel water. During their respiration and feeding, they take in water through the incurrent (or inhalant) siphon and expel the filtered water through the excurrent (or exhalant) siphon. Adult ascidian tunicates are sessile, immobile and permanently attached to rocks or other hard surfaces on the ocean floor. Thaliaceans (pyrosomes, doliolids, and salps) and larvaceans on the other hand, swim in the pelagic zone of the sea as adults.

Various species of ascidians, the most well-known class of tunicates, are commonly known as sea squirts, sea pork, sea livers, or sea tulips.

The earliest probable species of tunicate appears in the fossil record in the early Cambrian period.

Their name derives from their unique outer covering or &quot;tunic&quot;, which is formed from proteins and carbohydrates, and acts as an exoskeleton. In some species, it is thin, translucent, and gelatinous, while in others it is thick, tough, and stiff.

== Taxonomy ==

About 3,000 species of tunicate exist in the world&#x27;s oceans, living mostly in shallow water. The most numerous group is the ascidians; fewer than 100 species of these are found at depths greater than . Some are solitary animals leading a sessile existence attached to the seabed, but others are colonial and a few are pelagic. Some are supported by a stalk, but most are attached directly to a substrate, which may be a rock, shell, coral, seaweed, mangrove root, dock, piling, or ship&#x27;s hull. They are found in a range of solid or translucent colours and may resemble seeds, grapes, peaches, barrels, or bottles. One of the largest is a stalked sea tulip, &quot;Pyura pachydermatina&quot;, which can grow to be over tall.

The Tunicata were established by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1816. In 1881, Francis Maitland Balfour introduced another name for the same group, &quot;Urochorda&quot;, to emphasize the affinity of the group to other chordates. No doubt largely because of his influence, various authors supported the term, either as such, or as the slightly older &quot;Urochordata&quot;, but this usage is invalid because &quot;Tunicata&quot; has precedence, and grounds for superseding the name never existed. Accordingly, the current (formally correct) trend is to abandon the name Urochorda or Urochordata in favour of the original Tunicata, and the name Tunicata is almost invariably used in modern scientific works. It is accepted as valid by the World Register of Marine Species but not by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System.

Various common names are used for different species. Sea tulips are tunicates with colourful bodies supported on slender stalks. Sea squirts are so named because of their habit of contracting their bodies sharply and squirting out water when disturbed. Sea liver and sea pork get their names from the resemblance of their dead colonies to pieces of meat.

=== Classification ===
Tunicates are more closely related to craniates (including hagfish, lampreys, and jawed vertebrates) than to lancelets, echinoderms, hemichordates, &quot;Xenoturbella&quot; or other invertebrates.

The clade consisting of tunicates and vertebrates is called Olfactores.

The Tunicata contain roughly 3,051 described species, traditionally divided into these classes:
* Ascidiacea (Aplousobranchia, Phlebobranchia, and Stolidobranchia)
* Thaliacea (Pyrosomida, Doliolida, and Salpida)
* Appendicularia (Copelata)

Members of the Sorberacea were included in Ascidiacea in 2011 as a result of rDNA sequencing studies. Although the traditional classification is provisionally accepted, newer evidence suggests the Ascidiacea are an artificial group of paraphyletic status. A close relationship between Thaliacea and Ascidiacea, with the former possibly emerging from the latter, had already been proposed since the early 20th century under the name of Acopa.

The following cladogram is based on the 2018 phylogenomic study of Delsuc and colleagues.

===Fossil record===

Undisputed fossils of tunicates are rare. The best known and earliest unequivocally identified species is &quot;Shankouclava shankouense&quot; from the Lower Cambrian Maotianshan Shale at Shankou village, Anning, near Kunming (South China). There is also a common bioimmuration, (&quot;Catellocaula vallata&quot;), of a possible tunicate found in Upper Ordovician bryozoan skeletons of the upper midwestern United States. A well-preserved Cambrian fossil, &quot;Megasiphon thylakos&quot;, shows that the tunicate basic body design had already been established 500 million years ago.

Three enigmatic species were also found from the Ediacaran period – &quot;Ausia fenestrata&quot; from the Nama Group of Namibia, the sac-like &quot;Yarnemia ascidiformis&quot;, and one from a second new &quot;Ausia&quot;-like genus from the Onega Peninsula of northern Russia, &quot;Burykhia hunti&quot;. Results of a new study have shown possible affinity of these Ediacaran organisms to the ascidians. &quot;Ausia&quot; and &quot;Burykhia&quot; lived in shallow coastal waters slightly more than 555 to 548 million years ago, and are believed to be the oldest evidence of the chordate lineage of metazoans. The Russian Precambrian fossil &quot;Yarnemia&quot; is identified as a tunicate only tentatively, because its fossils are nowhere near as well-preserved as those of &quot;Ausia&quot; and &quot;Burykhia&quot;, so this identification has been questioned.

Fossils of tunicates are rare because their bodies decay soon after death, but in some tunicate families, microscopic spicules are present, which may be preserved as microfossils. These spicules have occasionally been found in Jurassic and later rocks, but, as few palaeontologists are familiar with them, they may have been mistaken for sponge spicules.

In the Permian and the Triassic, there were also forms with a calcareous exoskeleton. At first, they were mistaken for corals.

===Hybridization studies===

A multi-taxon molecular study in 2010 proposed that sea squirts are descended from a hybrid between a chordate and a protostome ancestor (before the divergence of panarthropods and nematodes). This study was based on a quartet partitioning approach designed to reveal horizontal gene transfer events among metazoan phyla.

==Anatomy==

===Body form===

Colonies of tunicates occur in a range of forms, and vary in the degree to which individual organisms, known as zooids, integrate with one another. In the simplest systems, the individual animals are widely separated, but linked together by horizontal connections called stolons, which grow along the seabed. Other species have the zooids growing closer together in a tuft or clustered together and sharing a common base. The most advanced colonies involve the integration of the zooids into a common structure surrounded by the tunic. These may have separate buccal siphons and a single central atrial siphon and may be organized into larger systems, with hundreds of star-shaped units. Often, the zooids in a colony are tiny but very numerous, and the colonies can form large encrusting or mat-like patches.

===Body structure===
By far the largest class of tunicates is the Ascidiacea. The body of an ascidiacean is surrounded by a test or tunic, from which the subphylum derives its name. This varies in thickness between species but may be tough, resembling cartilage, thin and delicate, or transparent and gelatinous. The tunic is composed of proteins, crosslinked by phenoloxidase reaction, and complex carbohydrates, and includes tunicin, a variety of cellulose. The tunic is unique among invertebrate exoskeletons in that it can grow as the animal enlarges and does not need to be periodically shed. Inside the tunic is the body wall or mantle composed of connective tissue, muscle fibres, blood vessels, and nerves. Two openings are found in the body wall: the buccal siphon at the top through which water flows into the interior, and the atrial siphon on the ventral side through which it is expelled. A large pharynx occupies most of the interior of the body. It is a muscular tube linking the buccal opening with the rest of the gut. It has a ciliated groove known as an endostyle on its ventral surface, and this secretes a mucous net which collects food particles and is wound up on the dorsal side of the pharynx. The gullet, at the lower end of the pharynx, links it to a loop of gut which terminates near the atrial siphon. The walls of the pharynx are perforated by several bands of slits, known as stigmata, through which water escapes into the surrounding water-filled cavity, the atrium. This is criss-crossed by various rope-like mesenteries which extend from the mantle and provide support for the pharynx, preventing it from collapsing, and also hold up the other organs.

The Thaliacea, the other main class of tunicates, is characterised by free-swimming, pelagic individuals. They are all filter feeders using a pharyngeal mucous net to catch their prey. The pyrosomes are bioluminous colonial tunicates with a hollow cylindrical structure. The buccal siphons are on the outside and the atrial siphons inside. About ten species are known, and all are found in the tropics. The 23 species of doliolids are small, mostly under long. They are solitary, have the two siphons at opposite ends of their barrel-shaped bodies, and swim by jet propulsion. The 40 species of salps are also small, under long, and found in the surface waters of both warm and cold seas. They also move by jet propulsion, and often form long chains by budding off new individuals.

A third class, the Larvacea (or Appendicularia), is the only group of tunicates to retain their chordate characteristics in the adult state, a product of extensive neoteny. The 70 species of larvaceans superficially resemble the tadpole larvae of amphibians, although the tail is at right angles to the body. The notochord is retained, and the animals, mostly under 1 cm long, are propelled by undulations of the tail. They secrete an external mucous net known as a house, which may completely surround them and is very efficient at trapping planktonic particles.

===Physiology and internal anatomy===

Like all other chordates, tunicates have a notochord during their early development, but it is lost by the time they have completed their metamorphosis. As members of the Chordata, they are true Coelomata with endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm, but they do not develop very clear coelomic body cavities, if any at all. Whether they do or not, by the end of their larval development, all that remain are the pericardial, renal, and gonadal cavities of the adults. Except for the heart, gonads, and pharynx (or branchial sac), the organs are enclosed in a membrane called an epicardium, which is surrounded by the jelly-like mesenchyme.

Ascidian tunicates begin life as a lecithotrophic (non-feeding) mobile larva that resembles a tadpole, with the exception of some members of the families Styelidae and Molgulidae which has direct development. The latter also have several species with tail-less larval forms. The ascidian larvae very rapidly settle down and attach themselves to a suitable surface, later developing into a barrel-like and usually sedentary adult form. The species in the class Appendicularia are pelagic, and the general larval form is kept throughout life. Also the class Thaliacea is pelagic throughout their lives and may have complex lifecycles. In this class a free living larval stage is absent: Doliolids and pyrosomatids are viviparous–lecithotrophic, and salpids are viviparous–matrotrophic. Only some species of doliolids still have a rudimentary tailed tadpole stage, which is never free-living and lacks a brain.

Tunicates have a well-developed heart and circulatory system. The heart is a double U-shaped tube situated just below the gut. The blood vessels are simple connective tissue tubes, and their blood has several types of corpuscle. The blood may appear pale green, but this is not due to any respiratory pigments, and oxygen is transported dissolved in the plasma. Exact details of the circulatory system are unclear, but the gut, pharynx, gills, gonads, and nervous system seem to be arranged in series rather than in parallel, as happens in most other animals. Every few minutes, the heart stops beating and then restarts, pumping fluid in the reverse direction.

Tunicate blood has some unusual features. In some species of Ascidiidae and Perophoridae, it contains high concentrations of the transitional metal vanadium and vanadium-associated proteins in vacuoles in blood cells known as vanadocytes. Some tunicates can concentrate vanadium up to a level ten million times that of the surrounding seawater. It is stored in a +3 oxidation form that requires a pH of less than 2 for stability, and this is achieved by the vacuoles also containing sulfuric acid. The vanadocytes are later deposited just below the outer surface of the tunic, where their presence is thought to deter predation, although it is unclear whether this is due to the presence of the metal or low pH. Other species of tunicates concentrate lithium, iron, niobium, and tantalum, which may serve a similar function. Other tunicate species produce distasteful organic compounds as chemical defenses against predators.

Tunicates lack the kidney-like metanephridial organs typical of deuterostomes. Most have no excretory structures, but rely on the diffusion of ammonia across their tissues to rid themselves of nitrogenous waste, though some have a simple excretory system. The typical renal organ is a mass of large clear-walled vesicles that occupy the rectal loop, and the structure has no duct. Each vesicle is a remnant of a part of the primitive coelom, and its cells extract nitrogenous waste matter from circulating blood. They accumulate the wastes inside the vesicles as urate crystals, and do not have any obvious means of disposing of the material during their lifetimes.

Adult tunicates have a hollow cerebral ganglion, equivalent to a brain, and a hollow structure known as a neural gland. Both originate from the embryonic neural tube and are located between the two siphons. Nerves arise from the two ends of the ganglion; those from the anterior end innervate the buccal siphon and those from the posterior end supply the rest of the body, the atrial siphon, organs, gut and the musculature of the body wall. There are no sense organs but there are sensory cells on the siphons, the buccal tentacles and in the atrium.

Tunicates are unusual among animals in that they produce a large fraction of their tunic and some other structures in the form of cellulose. The production in animals of cellulose is so unusual that at first some researchers denied its presence outside of plants, but the tunicates were later found to possess a functional cellulose synthesizing enzyme, encoded by a gene horizontally transferred from a bacterium. When, in 1845, Carl Schmidt first announced the presence in the test of some ascidians of a substance very similar to cellulose, he called it &quot;tunicine&quot;, but it is now recognized as cellulose rather than any alternative substance.

==Feeding==
Nearly all adult tunicates are suspension feeders (the larval form usually does not feed), capturing planktonic particles by filtering sea water through their bodies. Ascidians are typical in their digestive processes, but other tunicates have similar systems. Water is drawn into the body through the buccal siphon by the action of cilia lining the gill slits. To obtain enough food, an average ascidian needs to process one body-volume of water per second. This is drawn through a net lining the pharynx which is being continuously secreted by the endostyle. The net is made of sticky mucus threads with holes about 0.5 μm in diameter which can trap planktonic particles including bacteria. The net is rolled up on the dorsal side of the pharynx, and it and the trapped particles are drawn into the esophagus. The gut is U-shaped and also ciliated to move the contents along. The stomach is an enlarged region at the lowest part of the U-bend. Here, digestive enzymes are secreted and a pyloric gland (absent in appendicularians) adds further secretions. After digestion, the food is moved on through the intestine, where absorption takes place, and the rectum, where undigested remains are formed into faecal pellets or strings. The anus opens into the dorsal or cloacal part of the peribranchial cavity near the atrial siphon. Here, the faeces are caught up by the constant stream of water which carries the waste to the exterior. The animal orientates itself to the current in such a way that the buccal siphon is always upstream and does not draw in contaminated water.

Some ascidians that live on soft sediments are detritivores. A few deepwater species, such as &quot;Megalodicopia hians&quot;, are sit-and-wait predators, trapping tiny crustacea, nematodes, and other small invertebrates with the muscular lobes which surround their buccal siphons. Certain tropical species in the family Didemnidae have symbiotic green algae or cyanobacteria in their tunics, and one of these symbionts, &quot;Prochloron&quot;, is unique to tunicates. Excess photosynthetic products are assumed to be available to the host.

==Life cycle==
Ascidians are almost all hermaphrodites and each has a single ovary and testis, either near the gut or on the body wall. In some solitary species, sperm and eggs are shed into the sea and the larvae are planktonic. In others, especially colonial species, sperm is released into the water and drawn into the atria of other individuals with the incoming water current. Fertilization takes place here and the eggs are brooded through their early developmental stages. Some larval forms appear very much like primitive chordates with a notochord (stiffening rod) and superficially resemble small tadpoles. These swim by undulations of the tail and may have a simple eye, an ocellus, and a balancing organ, a statocyst.

When sufficiently developed, the larva of the sessile species finds a suitable rock and cements itself in place. The larval form is not capable of feeding, though it may have a rudimentary digestive system, and is only a dispersal mechanism. Many physical changes occur to the tunicate&#x27;s body during metamorphosis, one of the most significant being the reduction of the cerebral ganglion, which controls movement and is the equivalent of the vertebrate brain. From this comes the common saying that the sea squirt &quot;eats its own brain&quot;. However, the adult does possess a cerebral ganglion adapted to lack of self-locomotion. In the Thaliacea, the larval stage is rudimentary or suppressed, and the adults are pelagic (swimming or drifting in the open sea). Colonial forms also increase the size of the colony by budding off new individuals to share the same tunic.

Pyrosome colonies grow by budding off new zooids near the posterior end of the colony. Sexual reproduction starts within a zooid with an internally fertilized egg. This develops directly into an oozooid without any intervening larval form. This buds precociously to form four blastozooids which become detached in a single unit when the oozoid disintegrates. The atrial siphon of the oozoid becomes the exhalent siphon for the new, four-zooid colony.

Doliolids have a very complex life cycle that includes various zooids with different functions. The sexually reproducing members of the colony are known as gonozooids. Each one is a hermaphrodite with the eggs being fertilised by sperm from another individual. The gonozooid is viviparous, and at first, the developing embryo feeds on its yolk sac before being released into the sea as a free-swimming, tadpole-like larva. This undergoes metamorphosis in the water column into an oozooid. This is known as a &quot;nurse&quot; as it develops a tail of zooids produced by budding asexually. Some of these are known as trophozooids, have a nutritional function, and are arranged in lateral rows. Others are phorozooids, have a transport function, and are arranged in a single central row. Other zooids link to the phorozooids, which then detach themselves from the nurse. These zooids develop into gonozooids, and when these are mature, they separate from the phorozooids to live independently and start the cycle over again. Meanwhile, the phorozooids have served their purpose and disintegrate. The asexual phase in the lifecycle allows the doliolid to multiply very rapidly when conditions are favourable.

Salps also have a complex lifecycle with an alternation of generations. In the life history phase, an oozoid reproduces asexually, producing a chain of tens or hundreds of individual zooids by budding along the length of a stolon. The chain of salps is the &#x27;aggregate&#x27; portion of the lifecycle. The aggregate individuals, known as blastozooids, remain attached together while swimming and feeding and growing larger. The blastozooids are sequential hermaphrodites. An egg in each is fertilized internally by a sperm from another colony. The egg develops in a brood sac inside the blastozooid and has a placental connection to the circulating blood of its &quot;nurse&quot;. When it fills the blastozooid&#x27;s body, it is released to start the independent life of an oozooid.

Larvaceans only reproduce sexually. They are protandrous hermaphrodites, except for &quot;Oikopleura dioica&quot; which is gonochoric, and a larva resembles the tadpole larva of ascidians. Once the trunk is fully developed, the larva undergoes &quot;tail shift&quot;, in which the tail moves from a rearward position to a ventral orientation and twists through 90° relative to the trunk. The larva consists of a small, fixed number of cells, and grows by enlargement of these rather than cell division. Development is very rapid and only takes seven hours for a zygote to develop into a house-building juvenile starting to feed.

During embryonic development, tunicates exhibit determinate cleavage, where the fate of the cells is set early on with reduced cell numbers and genomes that are rapidly evolving. In contrast, the amphioxus and vertebrates show cell determination relatively late in development and cell cleavage is indeterminate. The genome evolution of amphioxus and vertebrates is also relatively slow.

===Promotion of out-crossing===

&quot;Ciona intestinalis&quot; (class Ascidiacea) is a hermaphrodite that releases sperm and eggs into the surrounding seawater almost simultaneously. It is self-sterile, and thus has been used for studies on the mechanism of self-incompatibility. Self/non-self-recognition molecules play a key role in the process of interaction between sperm and the vitelline coat of the egg. It appears that self/non-self recognition in ascidians such as &quot;C. intestinalis&quot; is mechanistically similar to self-incompatibility systems in flowering plants. Self-incompatibility promotes out-crossing, and thus provides the adaptive advantage at each generation of the masking of deleterious recessive mutations (i.e. genetic complementation) and the avoidance of inbreeding depression.

&quot;Botryllus schlosseri&quot; (class Ascidiacea) is a colonial tunicate, a member of the only group of chordates that are able to reproduce both sexually and asexually. &quot;B. schlosseri&quot; is a sequential (protogynous) hermaphrodite, and in a colony, eggs are ovulated about two days before the peak of sperm emission. Thus self-fertilization is avoided, and cross-fertilization is favored. Although avoided, self-fertilization is still possible in &quot;B. schlosseri&quot;. Self-fertilized eggs develop with a substantially higher frequency of anomalies during cleavage than cross-fertilized eggs (23% vs. 1.6%). Also a significantly lower percentage of larvae derived from self-fertilized eggs metamorphose, and the growth of the colonies derived from their metamorphosis is significantly lower. These findings suggest that self-fertilization gives rise to inbreeding depression associated with developmental deficits that are likely caused by expression of deleterious recessive mutations.

===A model tunicate===
&quot;Oikopleura dioica&quot; (class Appendicularia) is a semelparous organism, reproducing only once in its lifetime. It employs an original reproductive strategy in which the entire female germ-line is contained within an ovary that is a single giant multinucleate cell termed the &quot;coenocyst&quot;. &quot;O. dioica&quot; can be maintained in laboratory culture, and is of growing interest as a model organism because of its phylogenetic position within the closest sister group to vertebrates.

==Invasive species==
Over the past few decades, tunicates (notably of the genera &quot;Didemnum&quot; and &quot;Styela&quot;) have been invading coastal waters in many countries. The carpet tunicate (&quot;Didemnum vexillum&quot;) has taken over a area of the seabed on the Georges Bank off the northeast coast of North America, covering stones, molluscs, and other stationary objects in a dense mat. &quot;D. vexillum&quot;, &quot;Styela clava&quot; and &quot;Ciona savignyi&quot; have appeared and are thriving in Puget Sound and Hood Canal in the Pacific Northwest.

Invasive tunicates usually arrive as fouling organisms on the hulls of ships, but may also be introduced as larvae in ballast water. Another possible means of introduction is on the shells of molluscs brought in for marine cultivation. Current research indicates many tunicates previously thought to be indigenous to Europe and the Americas are, in fact, invaders. Some of these invasions may have occurred centuries or even millennia ago. In some areas, tunicates are proving to be a major threat to aquaculture operations.
==Use by humans==

===Medical uses===
Tunicates contain a host of potentially useful chemical compounds, including:
* Plitidepsin, a didemnin effective against various types of cancer; as of late January 2021 undergoing Phase III trials as a treatment for COVID-19
* Trabectedin, an FDA approved anticancer drug.
Tunicates are able to correct their own cellular abnormalities over a series of generations, and a similar regenerative process may be possible for humans. The mechanisms underlying the phenomenon may lead to insights about the potential of cells and tissues to be reprogrammed and to regenerate compromised human organs.

===As food===

Various Ascidiacea species are consumed as food around the world. The &quot;piure&quot; (&quot;Pyura chilensis&quot;) is used in the cuisine of Chile, both raw and in seafood stews. In Japan and Korea, the sea pineapple (&quot;Halocynthia roretzi&quot;) is the main species eaten. It is cultivated on dangling cords made of palm fronds. In 1994, over 42,000 tons were produced, but since then, mass mortality events have occurred among the farmed sea squirts (the tunics becoming soft), and only 4,500 tons were produced in 2004.

===Other uses===
The use of tunicates as a source of biofuel is being researched. The cellulose body wall can be broken down and converted into ethanol, and other parts of the animal are protein-rich and can be converted into fish feed. Culturing tunicates on a large scale may be possible and the economics of doing so are attractive. As tunicates have few predators, their removal from the sea may not have profound ecological impacts. Being sea-based, their production does not compete with food production as does the cultivation of land-based crops for biofuel projects.

Some tunicates are used as model organisms. &quot;Ciona intestinalis&quot; and &quot;Ciona savignyi&quot; have been used for developmental studies. Both species&#x27; mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have been sequenced. The nuclear genome of the appendicularian &quot;Oikopleura dioica&quot; appears to be one of the smallest among metazoans and this species has been used to study gene regulation and the evolution and development of chordates.

<text>The president of the Republic of Botswana is the head of state and the head of government of Botswana, as well as the commander-in-chief of the Botswana Defence Force, according to the Constitution. The president is elected by the National Assembly, the sole house of the Parliament, and is usually the leader of the largest party. The Constitution limits the president&#x27;s tenure to two five-year terms. The first president to be elected under the constitution was Sir Seretse Khama, who was the prime minister from 1965 to 1966. The incumbent is Duma Boko, who was elected by the National Assembly on 1 November 2024 following the 2024 general election. The president may be removed by a motion of no confidence. 

==Presidential term==
The president is elected to a five-year term that runs concurrently with the term of the National Assembly. Previously, a president could be reelected any number of times. In 1997, under the second president, Quett Masire, term limits were imposed on the office for the first time. Since 1998, the president has been limited to a total of 10 years in office (equivalent to two full terms), whether successive or separated. The first president for whom the term limits applied was Festus Mogae, who was required to leave office for good in 2008. Each president gets a guaranteed pension.

==Election==
The president is elected by the members of the National Assembly following a general election. All candidates for the National Assembly declare whom they endorse for president when they lodge their nomination papers, and the candidate who receives a majority of endorsements from the elected members of the National Assembly is automatically elected. If no candidate receives a majority of endorsements, the National Assembly elects the president by simple majority, before it co-opts the specially elected members. If no president is elected after three ballots, or if the Speaker determines that no candidate has enough support to be elected, the legislature is automatically dissolved for fresh elections. In practice, the president is the leader of the majority party or alliance in the Assembly. Also, given the first-past-the-post system for the National Assembly, majority governments have been the rule in Botswana since independence.

== Presidential powers ==
The president is the head of state, head of government and commander-in-chief of the Botswana Defence Force. The rights, responsibilities and remuneration of the president are enumerated in Chapter III of the Constitution and subsequent acts passed by the National Assembly.

The executive powers of the republic are vested in the president, who appoints various officials to positions listed in the Constitution, the most significant of which are the cabinet ministers and Justices of Appeal of the Court of Appeal. The president should consult the Cabinet on respective matters of policy. The president could assent or withhold his assent on bills passed by the National Assembly. If the National Assembly passed the bill again the President shall assent or withhold his assent within 21 days, or could dissolve the National Assembly. The president is accorded the constitutional powers to declare state of public emergencies and grant pardons or commutation with the advice of the Advisory Committee of Prerogative of Mercy.

<text>The equites (; , though sometimes referred to as &quot;knights&quot; in English) constituted the second of the property/social-based classes of ancient Rome, ranking below the senatorial class. A member of the equestrian order was known as an eques ().

==Description==
During the Roman Kingdom and the first century of the Roman Republic, legionary cavalry was recruited exclusively from the ranks of the patricians, who were expected to provide six &quot;centuriae&quot; (hundreds) of cavalry (300 horses for each consular legion). Around 400BC, 12 more &quot;centuriae&quot; of cavalry were established and these included non-patricians (plebeians). Around 300 BC the Samnite Wars obliged Rome to double the normal annual military levy from two to four legions, doubling the cavalry levy from 600 to 1,200 horses. Legionary cavalry started to recruit wealthier citizens from outside the 18 &quot;centuriae&quot;. These new recruits came from the first class of commoners in the Centuriate Assembly organisation, and were not granted the same privileges.

By the time of the Second Punic War (218–202 BC), all the members of the first class of commoners were required to serve as cavalrymen. The presence of &quot;equites&quot; in the Roman cavalry diminished steadily in the period 200–88 BC as only &quot;equites&quot; could serve as the army&#x27;s senior officers; as the number of legions proliferated fewer were available for ordinary cavalry service. After 88 BC, &quot;equites&quot; were no longer drafted into the legionary cavalry, although they remained technically liable to such service throughout the Principate era (to 284 AD). They continued to supply the senior officers of the army throughout the Principate.

With the exception of the purely hereditary patricians, the &quot;equites&quot; were originally defined by a property threshold. The rank was passed from father to son, although members of the order who at the regular quinquennial (every five years) census no longer met the property requirement were usually removed from the order&#x27;s rolls by the Roman censors. In the late republic, the property threshold stood at 50,000 &quot;denarii&quot; and was doubled to 100,000 by the emperor Augustus (sole rule 30 BC – 14 AD) – roughly the equivalent to the annual salaries of 450 contemporary legionaries. In the later republican period, Roman senators and their offspring became an unofficial elite within the equestrian order.
Under Augustus, the senatorial elite was given formal status (as the &quot;ordo senatorius&quot;) with a higher wealth threshold (250,000 &quot;denarii&quot;, or the pay of 1,100 legionaries) and superior rank and privileges to ordinary &quot;equites&quot;. During the Principate, &quot;equites&quot; filled the senior administrative and military posts of the imperial government. There was a clear division between jobs reserved for senators (the most senior) and those reserved for non-senatorial &quot;equites&quot;. But the career structure of both groups was broadly similar: a period of junior administrative posts in Rome or Roman Italy, followed by a period (normally a decade) of military service as a senior army officer, followed by senior administrative or military posts in the provinces. Senators and &quot;equites&quot; formed a tiny elite of under 10,000 members who monopolised political, military and economic power in an empire of about 60 million inhabitants.

During the 3rd century AD, power shifted from the Italian aristocracy to a class of &quot;equites&quot; who had earned their membership by distinguished military service, often rising from the ranks: career military officers from the provinces (especially the Balkan provinces) who displaced the Italian aristocrats in the top military posts, and under Diocletian (ruled 284–305) from the top civilian positions also. This effectively reduced the Italian aristocracy to an idle, but immensely wealthy, group of landowners. During the 4th century, the status of &quot;equites&quot; was debased to insignificance by excessive grants of the rank. At the same time the ranks of senators were swollen to over 4,000 by the establishment of the Byzantine Senate (a second senate in Constantinople) and the tripling of the membership of both senates. The senatorial order of the 4th century was thus the equivalent of the equestrian order of the Principate.

==Regal era (753–509 BC)==
According to Roman legend, Rome was founded by its first king, Romulus, in 753 BC. However, archaeological evidence suggests that Rome did not acquire the character of a unified city-state (as opposed to a number of separate hilltop settlements) until .

Roman tradition relates that the Order of Knights was founded by Romulus, who supposedly established a cavalry regiment of 300 men called the &quot;Celeres&quot; (&quot;Swift Squadron&quot;) to act as his personal escort, with each of the three Roman &quot;tribes&quot; (actually voting constituencies) supplying 100 horses. This cavalry regiment was supposedly doubled in size to 600 men by King Lucius Tarquinius Priscus (traditional dates 616–578 BC). That the cavalry was increased to 600 during the regal era is plausible, as in the early republic the cavalry fielded remained 600-strong (two legions with 300 horses each). However, according to Livy, King Servius Tullius (traditional reign-dates 578–535 BC) established a further 12 &quot;centuriae&quot; of &quot;equites&quot;, a further tripling of the cavalry. Yet this was probably anachronistic, as it would have resulted in a contingent of 1,800 horse, incongruously large, compared to the heavy infantry, which was probably only 6,000 strong in the late regal period. Instead, the additional 12 &quot;centuriae&quot; were probably created at a later stage, perhaps around 400 BC, but these new units were political not military, most likely designed to admit plebeians to the Order of Knights.

Apparently, &quot;equites&quot; were originally provided with a sum of money by the state to purchase a horse for military service and for its fodder. This was known as an &quot;equus publicus&quot;.

Theodor Mommsen argues that the royal cavalry was drawn exclusively from the ranks of the patricians (&quot;patricii&quot;), the aristocracy of early Rome, which was purely hereditary. Apart from the traditional association of the aristocracy with horsemanship, the evidence for this view is the fact that, during the republic, six &quot;centuriae&quot; (voting constituencies) of &quot;equites&quot; in the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot; (electoral assembly) retained the names of the original six royal cavalry &quot;centuriae&quot;. These are very likely the &quot;&quot;centuriae&quot; of patrician nobles&quot; in the &quot;comitia&quot; mentioned by the lexicologist Sextus Pompeius Festus. If this view is correct, it implies that the cavalry was exclusively patrician (and therefore hereditary) in the regal period. (However, Cornell considers the evidence tenuous).

==Early Republic (509–338 BC)==
It is widely accepted that the Roman monarchy was overthrown by a patrician coup, probably provoked by the Tarquin dynasty&#x27;s populist policies in favour of the plebeian class. The position and powers of a Roman king were thus similar to those of Julius Caesar when he was appointed dictator-for-life in 44 BC. That was why Caesar&#x27;s assassin, Marcus Junius Brutus, felt a moral obligation to emulate his claimed ancestor, Lucius Junius Brutus, &quot;the Liberator&quot;, the man who, Roman tradition averred, in 509 BC, led the coup that overthrew the last king, Tarquin the Proud, and established the republic. Alfoldi suggests that the coup was carried out by the &quot;celeres&quot; themselves. According to the Fraccaro interpretation, when the Roman monarchy was replaced with two annually elected &quot;praetores&quot; (later called &quot;consuls&quot;), the royal army was divided equally between them for campaigning purposes, which, if true, explains why Polybius later said that a legion&#x27;s cavalry contingent was 300 strong.

The 12 additional &quot;centuriae&quot; ascribed by Livy to Servius Tullius were, in reality, probably formed around 400 BC. In 403 BC, according to Livy, in a crisis during the siege of Veii, the army urgently needed to deploy more cavalry, and &quot;those who possessed equestrian rating but had not yet been assigned public horses&quot; volunteered to pay for their horses out of their own pockets. By way of compensation, pay was introduced for cavalry service, as it had already been for the infantry (in 406 BC).

The persons referred to in this passage were probably members of the 12 new &quot;centuriae&quot; who were entitled to public horses, but temporarily waived that privilege. Mommsen, however, argues that the passage refers to members of the first class of commoners being admitted to cavalry service in 403 BC for the first time as an emergency measure. If so, this group may be the original so-called &quot;equites&quot; &quot;equo privato&quot;, a rank that is attested throughout the history of the republic (in contrast to &quot;equites&quot; &quot;equo publico&quot;). However, due to a lack of evidence, the origins and definition of &quot;equo privato&quot; &quot;equites&quot; remain obscure.

It is widely agreed that the twelve new &quot;centuriae&quot; were open to non-patricians. Thus, from this date if not earlier, not all &quot;equites&quot; were patricians. The patricians, as a closed hereditary caste, steadily diminished in numbers over the centuries, as families died out. Around 450 BC, there are some 50 patrician &quot;gentes&quot; (clans) recorded, whereas just 14 remained at the time of Julius Caesar (dictator of Rome 48–44 BC), whose own Iulii clan was patrician.

In contrast, the ranks of &quot;equites&quot;, although also hereditary (in the male line), were open to new entrants who met the property requirement and who satisfied the Roman censors that they were suitable for membership. As a consequence, patricians rapidly became only a small minority of the equestrian order. However, patricians retained political influence greatly out of proportion with their numbers. Until 172 BC, one of the two consuls elected each year had to be a patrician.

In addition, patricians may have retained their original six &quot;centuriae&quot;, which gave them a third of the total voting-power of the &quot;equites&quot;, even though they constituted only a tiny minority of the order by 200 BC. Patricians also enjoyed official precedence, such as the right to speak first in senatorial debates, which were initiated by the &quot;princeps senatus&quot; (Leader of the Senate), a position reserved for patricians. In addition, patricians monopolized certain priesthoods and continued to enjoy enormous prestige.

==Later Republic (338–30 BC)==
===Transformation of state and army (338–290)===
The period following the end of the Latin War (340–338 BC) and of the Samnite Wars (343–290) saw the transformation of the Roman Republic from a powerful but beleaguered city-state into the hegemonic power of the Italian peninsula. This was accompanied by profound changes in its constitution and army. Internally, the critical development was the emergence of the Senate as the all-powerful organ of state.

By 280 BC, the Senate had assumed total control of state taxation, expenditure, declarations of war, treaties, raising of legions, establishing colonies and religious affairs, in other words, of virtually all political power. From an &quot;ad hoc&quot; group of advisors appointed by the consuls, the Senate had become a permanent body of around 300 life peers who, as largely former Roman magistrates, boasted enormous experience and influence. At the same time, the political unification of the Latin nation, under Roman rule after 338 BC, gave Rome a populous regional base from which to launch its wars of aggression against its neighbours.

The gruelling contest for Italian hegemony that Rome fought against the Samnite League led to the transformation of the Roman army from the Greek-style &quot;hoplite&quot; phalanx that it was in the early period, to the Italian-style manipular army described by Polybius. It is believed that the Romans copied the manipular structure from their enemies the Samnites, learning through hard experience its greater flexibility and effectiveness in the mountainous terrain of central Italy.

It is also from this period that every Roman army that took the field was regularly accompanied by at least as many troops supplied by the &quot;socii&quot; (Rome&#x27;s Italian military confederates, often referred to as &quot;Latin allies&quot;). Each legion would be matched by a confederate &quot;ala&quot; (literally: &quot;wing&quot;), a formation that contained roughly the same number of infantry as a legion, but three times the number of horses (900).

Legionary cavalry also probably underwent a transformation during this period, from the light, unarmoured horsemen of the early period to the Greek-style armoured cuirassiers described by Polybius. As a result of the demands of the Samnite hostilities, a normal consular army was doubled in size to two legions, making four legions raised annually overall. Roman cavalry in the field thus increased to approximately 1,200 horses.

This now represented only 25% of the army&#x27;s total cavalry contingent, the rest being supplied by the Italian confederates. A legion&#x27;s modest cavalry share of 7% of its 4,500 total strength was thus increased to 12% in a confederate army, comparable with (or higher than) any other forces in Italy except the Gauls and also similar to those in Greek armies such as Pyrrhus&#x27;s.

===Political role===
Despite an ostensibly democratic constitution based on the sovereignty of the people, the Roman Republic was in reality a classic oligarchy, in which political power was monopolised by the richest social echelon. Probably by 300 BC, the &quot;centuriate&quot; organisation of the Roman citizen body for political purposes achieved the evolved form described by Polybius and Livy. The &quot;comitia centuriata&quot; was the most powerful people&#x27;s assembly, as it promulgated Roman laws and annually elected the Roman magistrates, the executive officers of the state: consuls, &quot;praetors&quot;, &quot;aediles&quot; and &quot;quaestors&quot;.

In the assembly, the citizen body was divided into 193 &quot;centuriae&quot;, or voting constituencies. Of these, 18 were allocated to &quot;equites&quot; (including patricians) and a further 80 to the first class of commoners, securing an absolute majority of the votes (98 out of 193) for the wealthiest echelon of society, although it constituted only a small minority of the citizenry. (The lowest class, the &quot;proletarii&quot;, rated at under 400 &quot;drachmae&quot;, had just one vote, despite being the most numerous).

As a result, the wealthiest echelon could ensure that the elected magistrates were always their own members. In turn, this ensured that the senate was dominated by the wealthy classes, as its membership was composed almost entirely of current and former magistrates.


===Military officer role===

In the Polybian army of the middle republic (338 – 88 BC), &quot;equites&quot; held the exclusive right to serve as senior officers of the army. These were the six &quot;tribuni militum&quot; in each legion who were elected by the &quot;comitia&quot; at the start of each campaigning season and took turns to command the legion in pairs; the &quot;praefecti sociorum&quot;, commanders of the Italian confederate &quot;alae&quot;, who were appointed by the consuls; and the three &quot;decurions&quot; that led each squadron (&quot;turma&quot;) of legionary cavalry (a total of 30 &quot;decurions&quot; per legion).

===Cavalry role===
As their name implies, &quot;equites&quot; were liable to cavalry service in the legion of the mid-republic. They originally provided a legion&#x27;s entire cavalry contingent, although from an early stage (probably from c. 400 and not later than c. 300 BC), when equestrian numbers had become insufficient, large numbers of young men from the first class of commoners were regularly volunteering for the service, which was considered more glamorous than the infantry.

The cavalry role of &quot;equites&quot; dwindled after the Second Punic War (218–201 BC), as the number of equestrians became insufficient to provide the senior officers of the army and general cavalrymen as well. &quot;Equites&quot; became exclusively an officer-class, with the first class of commoners providing the legionary cavalry.

===Ethos===
From the earliest times and throughout the Republican period, Roman &quot;equites&quot; subscribed, in their role as Roman cavalrymen, to an ethos of personal heroism and glory. This was motivated by the desire to justify their privileged status to the lower classes that provided the infantry ranks, to enhance the renown of their family name, and to augment their chances of subsequent political advancement in a martial society. For &quot;equites&quot;, a focus of the heroic ethos was the quest for &quot;spolia opima&quot;, the stripped armour and weapons of a foe whom they had killed in single combat. There are many recorded instances. For example, Servilius Geminus Pulex, who went on to become Consul in 202 BC, was reputed to have gained &quot;spolia&quot; 23 times.

The higher the rank of the opponent killed in combat, the more prestigious the &quot;spolia&quot;, and none more so than &quot;spolia duci hostium detracta&quot;, spoils taken from an enemy leader himself. Many &quot;equites&quot; attempted to gain such an honour, but very few succeeded for the reason that enemy leaders were always surrounded by large numbers of elite bodyguards.

One successful attempt, but with a tragic twist, was that of the decurion Titus Manlius Torquatus in 340 BC during the Latin War. Despite strict orders from the consuls (one of whom was his own father) not to engage the enemy, Manlius could not resist accepting a personal challenge from the commander of the Tusculan cavalry, which his squadron encountered while on reconnaissance. There ensued a fiercely contested joust with the opposing squadrons as spectators. Manlius won, spearing his adversary after the latter was thrown by his horse. But when the triumphant young man presented the spoils to his father, the latter ordered his son&#x27;s immediate execution for disobeying orders. &quot;Orders of Manlius&quot; (&quot;Manliana imperia&quot;) became a proverbial army term for orders that must on no account be disregarded.

===Business activities===
In 218 BC, the &quot;lex Claudia&quot; restricted the commercial activity of senators and their sons, on the grounds that it was incompatible with their status. Senators were prohibited from owning ships of greater capacity than 300 amphorae (about seven tonnes) – this being judged sufficient to carry the produce of their own landed estates but too small to conduct large-scale sea transportation.

From this time onwards, senatorial families mostly invested their capital in land. All other equestrians remained free to invest their wealth, greatly increased by the growth of Rome&#x27;s overseas empire after the Second Punic War, in large-scale commercial enterprises including mining and industry, as well as land. Equestrians became especially prominent in tax farming and, by 100 BC, owned virtually all tax-farming companies (&quot;publicani&quot;).

During the late Republican era, the collection of most taxes was contracted out to private individuals or companies by competitive tender, with the contract for each province awarded to the &quot;publicanus&quot; who bid the highest advance to the state treasury on the estimated tax-take of the province. The &quot;publicanus&quot; would then attempt to recoup his advance, with the right to retain any surplus collected as his profit. This system frequently resulted in extortion from the common people of the provinces, as unscrupulous &quot;publicani&quot; often sought to maximise their profit by demanding a much higher rates of tax than originally set by the government. The provincial governors whose duty it was to curb illegal demands were often bribed into acquiescence by the &quot;publicani&quot;.

The system also led to political conflict between &quot;equites publicani&quot; and the majority of their fellow-&quot;equites&quot;, especially senators, who as large landowners wanted to minimise the tax on land outside Italy (&quot;tributum solis&quot;), which was the main source of state revenue. This system was terminated by the first Roman emperor, Augustus (sole rule 30 BC – 14 AD), who transferred responsibility for tax collection from the &quot;publicani&quot; to provincial local authorities (&quot;civitates peregrinae&quot;). Although the latter also frequently employed private companies to collect their tax quotas, it was in their own interests to curb extortion. During the imperial era, tax collectors were generally paid an agreed percentage of the amount collected. &quot;equites publicani&quot; became prominent in banking activities such as money-lending and money-changing.

The official dress of equestrians was the &quot;tunica angusticlavia&quot; (narrow-striped tunic), worn underneath the toga, in such a manner that the stripe over the right shoulder was visible (as opposed to the broad stripe worn by senators.) &quot;equites&quot; bore the title &quot;eques Romanus&quot;, were entitled to wear an &quot;anulus aureus&quot; (gold ring) on their left hand, and, from 67 BC, enjoyed privileged seats at games and public functions (just behind those reserved for senators).

==Augustan equestrian order (Principate era)==
===Differentiation of the senatorial order===
The Senate as a body was formed of sitting senators, whose number was held at around 600 by the founder of the Principate, Augustus (sole rule 30 BC – 14 AD) and his successors until 312. Senators&#x27; sons and further descendants technically retained equestrian rank unless and until they won a seat in the Senate. But Talbert argues that Augustus established the existing senatorial elite as a separate and superior order (&quot;ordo senatorius&quot;) to the &quot;equites&quot; for the first time. The evidence for this includes:
* Augustus, for the first time, set a minimum property requirement for admission to the Senate, of 250,000 &quot;denarii&quot;, two and a half times the 100,000 &quot;denarii&quot; that he set for admission to the equestrian order.
* Augustus, for the first time, allowed the sons of senators to wear the &quot;tunica laticlavia&quot; (tunic with broad purple stripes that was the official dress of senators) on reaching their majority even though they were not yet members of the Senate.
* Senators&#x27; sons followed a separate &quot;cursus honorum&quot; (career-path) to other &quot;equites&quot; before entering the Senate: first an appointment as one of the &quot;vigintiviri&quot; (&quot;Committee of Twenty&quot;, a body that included officials with a variety of minor administrative functions), or as an &quot;augur&quot; (priest), followed by at least a year in the military as &quot;tribunus militum laticlavius&quot; (deputy commander) of a legion. This post was normally held before the tribune had become a member of the Senate.
* A marriage law of 18 BC (the &quot;lex Julia&quot;) seems to define not only senators but also their descendants unto the third generation (in the male line) as a distinct group. There was thus established a group of men with senatorial rank (&quot;senatorii&quot;) wider than just sitting senators (&quot;senatores&quot;).

A family&#x27;s senatorial status depended not only on continuing to match the higher wealth qualification, but on their leading member holding a seat in the Senate. Failing either condition, the family would revert to ordinary knightly status. Although sons of sitting senators frequently won seats in the Senate, this was by no means guaranteed, as candidates often outnumbered the 20 seats available each year, leading to intense competition.

===&quot;Ordo equester&quot; under Augustus===
As regards the equestrian order, Augustus apparently abolished the rank of &quot;equo privato&quot;, according all its members &quot;equo publico&quot; status. In addition, Augustus organised the order in a quasi-military fashion, with members enrolled into six &quot;turmae&quot; (notional cavalry squadrons). The order&#x27;s governing body were the &quot;seviri&quot; (&quot;Committee of Six&quot;), composed of the &quot;commanders&quot; of the &quot;turmae&quot;. In an attempt to foster an &quot;esprit de corps&quot; amongst the &quot;equites&quot;, Augustus revived a defunct republican ceremony, the &quot;recognitio equitum&quot; (inspection of the &quot;equites&quot;), in which &quot;equites&quot; paraded every five years with their horses before the consuls. At some stage during the early Principate, &quot;equites&quot; acquired the right to the title &quot;egregius&quot; (&quot;distinguished gentleman&quot;), while senators were styled &quot;clarissimus&quot; (&quot;most distinguished&quot;).

Beyond &quot;equites&quot; with &quot;equus publicus&quot;, Augustus&#x27; legislation permitted any Roman citizen who was assessed in an official census as meeting the property requirement of 100,000 &quot;denarii&quot; to use the title of &quot;eques&quot; and wear the narrow-striped tunic and gold ring. But such &quot;property-qualified &quot;equites&quot; were not apparently admitted to the &quot;ordo equester&quot; itself, but simply enjoyed equestrian status.

Only those granted an &quot;equus publicus&quot; by the emperor (or who inherited the status from their fathers) were enrolled in the order. Imperial &quot;equites&quot; were thus divided into two tiers: a few thousand mainly Italian &quot;equites equo publico&quot;, members of the order eligible to hold the public offices reserved for the &quot;equites&quot;; and a much larger group of wealthy Italians and provincials (estimated at 25,000 in the 2nd century) of equestrian status but outside the order.

Equestrians could in turn be elevated to senatorial rank (e.g., Pliny the Younger), but in practice this was much more difficult than elevation from commoner to equestrian rank. To join the upper order, not only was the candidate required to meet the minimum property requirement of 250,000 &quot;denarii&quot;, but also had to be elected a member of the Senate. There were two routes for this, both controlled by the emperor:
* The normal route was election to the post of &quot;quaestor&quot;, the most junior magistracy (for which the minimum eligible age was 27 years), which carried automatic membership of the Senate. Twenty &quot;quaestors&quot; were appointed each year, a number that evidently broadly matched the average annual vacancies (caused by death or expulsion for misdemeanours or insufficient wealth) so that the 600-member limit was preserved. Under Augustus, senators&#x27; sons had the right to stand for election, while equestrians could only do so with the emperor&#x27;s permission. Later in the Julio-Claudian period, the rule became established that all candidates required imperial leave. Previously conducted by the people&#x27;s assembly (&quot;comitia centuriata&quot;), the election was in the hands, from the time of Tiberius onwards, of the Senate itself, whose sitting members inevitably favoured the sons of their colleagues. Since the latter alone often outnumbered the number of available places, equestrian candidates stood little chance unless they enjoyed the special support of the emperor.
* The exceptional route was direct appointment to a Senate seat by the emperor (&quot;adlectio&quot;), technically using the powers of Roman censor (which also entitled him to expel members). &quot;Adlectio&quot; was, however, generally used sparingly in order not to breach the 600-member ceiling. It was chiefly resorted to in periods when Senate numbers became severely depleted, e.g. during the Civil War of 68–69, following which the emperor Vespasian made large-scale &quot;adlectiones&quot;.

===Equestrian public careers===

Equestrians exclusively provided the &quot;praefecti&quot; (commanders) of the imperial army&#x27;s auxiliary regiments and five of the six &quot;tribuni militum&quot; (senior staff officers) in each legion. The standard equestrian officer progression was known as the &quot;tres militiae&quot;&quot; (&quot;three services&quot;): &quot;praefectus&quot; of a &quot;cohors&quot; (auxiliary infantry regiment), followed by &quot;tribunus militum&quot; in a legion, and finally &quot;praefectus&quot; of an &quot;ala&quot; (auxiliary cavalry regiment). From the time of Hadrian, a fourth militia was added for exceptionally gifted officers, commander of an &quot;ala milliaria&quot; (double-strength &quot;ala&quot;). Each post was held for three to four years.

Most of the top posts in the imperial administration were reserved for senators, who provided the governors of the larger provinces (except Egypt), the &quot;legati legionis&quot; (legion commanders) of all legions outside Egypt, and the &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; (prefect of the city of Rome), who controlled the &quot;cohortes urbanae&quot; (public order battalions), the only fully armed force in the city apart from the Praetorian Guard. Nevertheless, a wide range of senior administrative and military posts were created and reserved for equestrians by Augustus, though most ranked below the senatorial posts.

In the imperial administration, equestrian posts included that of the governorship (&quot;praefectus Augusti&quot;) of the province of Egypt, which was considered the most prestigious of all the posts open to &quot;equites&quot;, often the culmination of a long and distinguished career serving the state. In addition, &quot;equites&quot; were appointed to the governorship (&quot;procurator Augusti&quot;) of some smaller provinces and sub-provinces e.g. Judaea, whose governor was subordinate to the governor of Syria.

Equestrians were also the chief financial officers (also called &quot;procuratores Augusti&quot;) of the imperial provinces, and the deputy financial officers of senatorial provinces. At Rome, equestrians filled numerous senior administrative posts such as the emperor&#x27;s secretaries of state (from the time of Claudius, e.g. correspondence and treasury) and the &quot;praefecti annonae&quot; (director of grain supplies).

In the military, equestrians provided the &quot;praefecti praetorio&quot; (commanders of the Praetorian Guard) who also acted as the emperor&#x27;s chiefs of military staff. There were normally two of these, but at times irregular appointments resulted in just a single incumbent or even three at the same time. Equestrians also provided the &quot;praefecti classis&quot; (admirals commanding) of the two main imperial fleets at Misenum in the bay of Naples and at Ravenna on the Italian Adriatic coast. The command of Rome&#x27;s fire brigade and minor constabulary, the &quot;vigiles&quot;, was likewise reserved for &quot;equites&quot;.

Not all &quot;equites&quot; followed the conventional career-path. Those equestrians who specialised in a legal or administrative career, providing judges (&quot;iudices&quot;) in Rome&#x27;s law courts and state secretaries in the imperial government, were granted dispensation from military service by Emperor Hadrian (r. AD 117–138). At the same time, many &quot;equites&quot; became career military officers, remaining in the army for much longer than 10 years. After completing their &quot;tres militiae&quot;, some would continue to command auxiliary regiments, moving across units and provinces.

Already wealthy to start with, &quot;equites equo publico&quot; accumulated even greater riches through holding their reserved senior posts in the administration, which carried enormous salaries (although they were generally smaller than senatorial salaries). For example, the salaries of equestrian &quot;procuratores&quot; (fiscal and gubernatorial) ranged from 15,000 to a maximum of 75,000 &quot;denarii&quot; (for the governor of Egypt) per annum, whilst an equestrian &quot;praefectus&quot; of an auxiliary cohort was paid about 50 times as much as a common foot soldier (about 10,000 &quot;denarii&quot;). A &quot;praefectus&quot; could thus earn in one year the same as two of his auxiliary rankers combined earned during their entire 25-year service terms.

===Relations with the emperor===
It was suggested by ancient writers, and accepted by many modern historians, that Roman emperors trusted equestrians more than men of senatorial rank, and used the former as a political counterweight to the senators. According to this view, senators were often regarded as potentially less loyal and honest by the emperor, as they could become powerful enough, through the command of provincial legions, to launch coups.

They also had greater opportunities for peculation as provincial governors. Hence the appointment of equestrians to the most sensitive military commands. In Egypt, which supplied much of Italy&#x27;s grain needs, the governor and the commanders of both provincial legions were drawn from the equestrian order, since placing a senator in a position to starve Italy was considered too risky.

The commanders of the Praetorian Guard, the principal military force close to the emperor at Rome, were also usually drawn from the equestrian order. Also cited in support of this view is the appointment of equestrian fiscal &quot;procuratores&quot;, reporting direct to the emperor, alongside senatorial provincial governors. These would supervise the collection of taxes and act as watchdogs to limit opportunities for corruption by the governors (as well as managing the imperial estates in the province).

According to Talbert, however, the evidence suggests that &quot;equites&quot; were no more loyal or less corrupt than senators. For example, c. 26 BC, the equestrian governor of Egypt, Cornelius Gallus, was recalled for politically suspect behaviour and sundry other misdemeanours. His conduct was deemed sufficiently serious by the Senate to warrant the maximum penalty of exile and confiscation of assets. Under Tiberius, both the senatorial governor and the equestrian fiscal procurator of Asia province were convicted of corruption.

There is evidence that emperors were as wary of powerful &quot;equites&quot; as they were of senators. Augustus enforced a tacit rule that senators and prominent equestrians must obtain his express permission to enter the province of Egypt, a policy that was continued by his successors. Also, the command of the Praetorian Guard was normally split between two &quot;equites&quot;, to reduce the potential for a successful &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. At the same time, command of the second military force in Rome, the &quot;cohortes urbanae&quot;, was entrusted to a senator.

===Oligarchical rule in the early Principate (to 197 AD)===
Because the Senate was limited to 600 members, &quot;equites&quot; &quot;equo publico&quot;, numbering several thousands, greatly outnumbered men of senatorial rank. Even so, senators and &quot;equites&quot; combined constituted a tiny elite in a citizen-body of about 6 million (in 47 AD) and an empire with a total population of 60–70 million. This immensely wealthy elite monopolised political, military and economic power in the empire. It controlled the major offices of state, command of all military units, ownership of a significant proportion of the empire&#x27;s arable land (e.g., under Nero (), half of all land in Africa Proconsularis province was owned by just six senators) and of most major commercial enterprises.

Overall, senators and &quot;equites&quot; cooperated smoothly in the running of the empire. In contrast to the chaotic civil wars of the late Republic, the rule of this tiny oligarchy achieved a remarkable degree of political stability. In the first 250 years of the Principate (30 BC – 218 AD), there was only a single episode of major internal strife: the civil war of 68–69.

===Equestrian hierarchy===

It seems that from the start the equestrians in the imperial service were organised on a hierarchical basis reflecting their pay-grades. According to Suetonius, writing in the early part of the second century AD, the equestrian procurators who &quot;performed various administrative duties throughout the empire&quot; were from the time of Emperor Claudius I organised into four pay-grades, the &quot;trecenarii&quot; the &quot;ducenarii&quot;, the &quot;centenarii&quot;, and the &quot;sexagenarii&quot;, receiving 300,000, 200,000, 100,000, and 60,000 sesterces per annum respectively. Cassius Dio, writing a century later, attributed the beginnings of this process to the first emperor, Augustus, himself.

There is almost no literary or epigraphic evidence for the use of these ranks until towards the end of the 2nd century. However, it would seem that the increasing employment of equestrians by the emperors in civil and military roles had had social ramifications for it is then that there begin to appear the first references to a more far-reaching hierarchy with three distinct classes covering the whole of the order: the &quot;Viri Egregii&quot; (Select Men); the &quot;Viri Perfectissimi&quot; (&quot;Best of Men&quot;); and the &quot;Viri Eminentissimi&quot; (&quot;Most Eminent of Men&quot;). The mechanisms by which the equestrians were organised into these classes and the distinctions enforced is not known. However, it is generally assumed that the highest class, the &quot;Viri Eminentissimi&quot;, was confined to the &quot;Praetorian prefects&quot;, while the &quot;Viri Perfectissimi&quot; were the heads of the main departments of state, and the great prefectures, including Egypt, the city watch (&quot;vigiles&quot;), the corn supply (&quot;annona&quot;) etc. and men commissioned to carry out specific tasks by the emperor himself such as the military &quot;duces&quot;. The defining characteristic of the &quot;perfectissimate&quot; seems to have been that its members were of or associated socially (i.e. as &quot;clientes&quot; - see Patronage in ancient Rome of Great Men) with the imperial court circle and were office-holders known to the emperor and appointed by his favour. It is also possible that system was intended to indicate the hierarchy of office-holders in situations where this might be disputed. The &quot;Viri Egregii&quot; comprehended the rest of the Equestrian Order, in the service of the emperors.

The &quot;Viri Egregii&quot; included officials of all four pay-grades. &quot;Ducenariate&quot; procurators governing provinces not reserved for senators were of this category, as were the &quot;praefecti legionum&quot;, after Gallienus opened all legionary commands to equestrians. However, it seems that after 270 AD the &quot;procuratores ducenarii&quot; were elevated into the ranks of the &quot;Viri Perfectissimi&quot;.

==Equestrians in the later Empire (AD 197–395)==
===Rise of the military equestrians (3rd century)===
The 3rd century saw two major trends in the development of the Roman aristocracy: the progressive takeover of the top positions in the empire&#x27;s administration and army by military equestrians and the concomitant exclusion of the Italian aristocracy, both senators and &quot;equites&quot; and the growth in hierarchy within the aristocratic orders.

Augustus instituted a policy, followed by his successors, of elevating to the &quot;ordo equester&quot; the &quot;primus pilus&quot; (chief centurion) of each legion, at the end of his single year in the post. This resulted in about 30 career-soldiers, often risen from the ranks, joining the order every year. These &quot;equites primipilares&quot; and their descendants formed a section of the order that was quite distinct from the Italian aristocrats who had become nearly indistinguishable from their senatorial counterparts.

They were almost entirely provincials, especially from the Danube provinces where about half the Roman army was deployed. These Danubians mostly came from Pannonia, Moesia, Thrace, Illyria and Dalmatia. They were generally far less wealthy than the landowning Italians (not benefiting from centuries of inherited wealth) and they rarely held non-military posts.

Their professionalism led emperors to rely on them ever more heavily, especially in difficult conflicts such as the Marcomannic Wars (166–180). But because they were only equestrians, they could not be appointed to the top military commands, those of &quot;legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot; (governor of an imperial province, where virtually all military units were deployed) and &quot;legatus legionis&quot; (commander of a legion). In the later 2nd century, emperors tried to circumvent the problem by elevating large numbers of &quot;primipilares&quot; to senatorial rank by &quot;adlectio&quot;.

This met resistance in the Senate, so that in the 3rd century, emperors simply appointed equestrians directly to the top commands, under the fiction that they were only temporary substitutes (&quot;praeses pro legato&quot;). Septimius Severus () appointed &quot;primipilares&quot; to command the three new legions that he raised in 197 for his Parthian War, Legio I, II &amp; III Parthica Gallienus () completed the process by appointing &quot;equites&quot; to command all the legions. These appointees were mostly provincial soldier-equestrians, not Italian aristocrats.

Under the reforming emperor Diocletian (), himself an Illyrian equestrian officer, the military equestrian &quot;takeover&quot; was brought a stage further, with the removal of hereditary senators from most administrative, as well as military posts. Hereditary senators were limited to administrative jobs in Italy and a few neighbouring provinces (Sicily, Africa, Achaea and Asia), despite the fact that senior administrative posts had been greatly multiplied by the tripling of the number of provinces and the establishment of dioceses (super-provinces). The exclusion of the old Italian aristocracy, both senatorial and equestrian, from the political and military power that they had monopolised for many centuries was thus complete. The senate became politically insignificant, although it retained great prestige.

The 3rd and 4th centuries saw the proliferation of hierarchical ranks within the aristocratic orders, in line with the greater stratification of society as a whole, which became divided into two broad classes, with discriminatory rights and privileges: the &quot;honestiores&quot; (more noble) and &quot;humiliores&quot; (more base). Among the &quot;honestiores&quot;, equestrians were divided into five grades, depending on the salary-levels of the offices they held.

These ranged from &quot;egregii&quot; or &quot;sexagenarii&quot; (salary of 60,000 &quot;sesterces&quot; = 15,000 &quot;denarii&quot;) to the &quot;eminentissimi&quot; (most exalted), limited to the two commanders of the Praetorian Guard and, with the establishment of Diocletian&#x27;s Tetrarchy, the four &quot;praefecti praetorio&quot; (not to be confused with the commanders of the Praetorian Guard in Rome) that assisted the tetrarchs, each ruling over a quarter of the empire.

===Idle aristocracy (4th century)===
From the reign of Constantine the Great () onwards, there was an explosive increase in the membership of both aristocratic orders. Under Diocletian, the number of sitting members of the Senate remained at around 600, the level it had retained for the whole duration of the Principate. Constantine established Constantinople as a twin capital of the empire, with its own senate, initially of 300 members. By 387, their number had swollen to 2,000, while the Senate in Rome probably reached a comparable size, so that the upper order reached total numbers similar to the &quot;equo publico&quot; &quot;equites&quot; of the early Principate. By this time, even some commanders of military regiments were accorded senatorial status.

At the same time the order of &quot;equites&quot; was also expanded vastly by the proliferation of public posts in the late empire, most of which were now filled by equestrians. The Principate had been a remarkably slim-line administration, with about 250 senior officials running the vast empire, relying on local government and private contractors to deliver the necessary taxes and services. During the 3rd century the imperial bureaucracy, all officials and ranks expanded. By the time of the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, dated to 395 AD, comparable senior positions had grown to approximately 6,000, a 24-fold increase. The total number enrolled in the imperial civilian service, the &quot;militia inermata&quot; (&#x27;unarmed service&#x27;) is estimated to have been 30–40,000: the service was professionalized with a staff made up almost entirely of free men on salary, and enrolled in a fictional legion, I Audiutrix.

In addition, large numbers of &quot;decuriones&quot; (local councillors) were granted equestrian rank, often obtaining it by bribery. Officials of ever lower rank were granted equestrian rank as reward for good service, e.g. in 365, the &quot;actuarii&quot; (accountants) of military regiments. This inflation in the number of &quot;equites&quot; inevitably led to the debasement of the order&#x27;s prestige. By 400 AD, &quot;equites&quot; were no longer an echelon of nobility, but just a title associated with mid-level administrative posts.

Constantine established a third order of nobility, the &quot;comites&quot; (companions (of the emperor), singular form &quot;comes&quot;, the origin of the medieval noble rank of count). This overlapped with senators and &quot;equites&quot;, drawing members from both. Originally, the &quot;comites&quot; were a highly exclusive group, comprising the most senior administrative and military officers, such as the commanders of the &quot;comitatus&quot;, or mobile field armies. But &quot;comites&quot; rapidly followed the same path as &quot;equites&quot;, being devalued by excessive grants until the title became meaningless by 450.

In the late 4th and in the 5th century, therefore, the senatorial class at Rome and Constantinople became the closest equivalent to the &quot;equo publico&quot; equestrian class of the early Principate. It contained many ancient and illustrious families, some of whom claimed descent from the aristocracy of the Republic, but had, as described, lost almost all political and military power. Nevertheless, senators retained great influence due to their enormous inherited wealth and their role as the guardians of Roman tradition and culture.

Centuries of capital accumulation, in the form of vast landed estates (&quot;latifundia&quot;) across many provinces resulted in enormous wealth for most senators. Many received annual rents in cash and in kind of over 5,000 lbs of gold, equivalent to 360,000 &quot;solidi&quot; (or 5 million Augustan-era &quot;denarii&quot;), at a time when a &quot;miles&quot; (common soldier) would earn no more than four &quot;solidi&quot; a year in cash. Even senators of middling wealth could expect an income 1,000–1,500 lbs of gold.

The 4th-century historian Ammianus Marcellinus, a former high-ranking military staff officer who spent his retirement years in Rome, bitterly attacked the Italian aristocracy, denouncing their extravagant palaces, clothes, games and banquets and above all their lives of total idleness and frivolity. In his words can be heard the contempt for the senatorial class of a career soldier who had spent his lifetime defending the empire, a view clearly shared by Diocletian and his Illyrian successors. But it was the latter who reduced the aristocracy to that state, by displacing them from their traditional role of governing the empire and leading the army.

<text>Cassie René Bernall (November 6, 1981April 20, 1999) was an American student who was killed in the Columbine High School massacre, where 11 more students and a teacher were killed by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who then committed suicide. It was reported that Bernall had been asked whether or not she believed in God, and she said &quot;Yes&quot;, before being shot during the massacre. However, investigators concluded the person who was asked about her belief in God was Valeen Schnurr, who survived the shooting.

In September 1999, Bernall&#x27;s mother, Misty, released &quot;She Said Yes: The Unlikely Martyrdom of Cassie Bernall&quot;. In it, Misty describes her daughter&#x27;s turbulent teenage life, conversion and Christian faith.

==Life==
Cassie was born to Misty and Brad Bernall on November 6, 1981, in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. Along with her brother Chris, she was brought up in a Christian home. According to her parents, she rebelled as a young teenager and began using drugs, such as alcohol, and at one point she became suicidal. Her mother found letters in her bedroom discussing her thoughts of killing her parents, and they decided to send her to a new school, Columbine High School, for a new start. A year and a half before her death, Bernall decided to go on a weekend church retreat and restored her faith. Her father said &quot;When she came back from that retreat, she was an entirely different person. We had gotten our daughter back.&quot;

==Murder==
Bernall was killed by Eric Harris during the Columbine massacre on April 20, 1999. According to witness Emily Wyant, who was hiding under the same table as Bernall, Harris slammed his hand twice down on the table above them and said &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; before fatally shooting Bernall in the head. The shotgun blast that killed Bernall ricocheted, resulting in a nose injury to Harris. Her family had no knowledge of her death until April 22, when they were notified.

== Legacy ==
=== Martyrdom ===
The deaths of Bernall and fellow student and Christian Rachel Scott during the Columbine massacre led both to be subsequently depicted and remembered by groups of evangelical Christians as Christian martyrs. In the following years numerous books—termed &quot;hagiographies&quot; by sociologist Ralph Larkin—were published about Scott and Bernall with the assistance of or authorship by their parents.

===Controversy surrounding martyrdom claims===
Craig Scott, the brother of Rachel Scott, was a student also in the library during the massacre who told investigators that he had heard one of the shooters ask a victim whether or not they believed in God during the shooting, and that the victim answered, &quot;Yes.&quot; Scott said that he recognized the voice as Bernall&#x27;s, however, he did not see the exchange happen as he was hiding under the table at the time. Investigators later took Scott back into the library and asked him to point to where he had heard the exchange come from. He did not point to where Bernall had been in the library, but rather pointed to where Schnurr, another student that had been shot in the massacre, had been hiding.

Schnurr had been shot and was on the floor of the library when one of the shooters, Dylan Klebold approached her. She said, &quot;Oh, my God, oh, my God, don&#x27;t let me die.&quot; Klebold asked her if she believed in God. She said yes, and he asked why. She responded, &quot;Because I believe and my parents brought me up that way.&quot; Klebold reloaded but did not shoot her again, and Schnurr ultimately survived the massacre. Some media publicized the story of Bernall being asked about her belief in God before her death. The story persisted even decades later. In 2015, Rick Santorum used the scenario during a Republican presidential debate, saying &quot;16 years ago this country was tremendously inspired by a young woman who faced a gunman in Columbine and was challenged about her faith, and refused to deny God.&quot; However, Santorum did not attach a name to the story, and may have been referencing Schnurr.

===&quot;She Said Yes: The Unlikely Martyrdom of Cassie Bernall&quot;===

In September 1999, Bernall&#x27;s mother, Misty Bernall, authored the book &quot;She Said Yes: The Unlikely Martyrdom of Cassie Bernall&quot;. The book reached No. 8 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-sellers list.

In the book, Misty Bernall repeated the story that her daughter was asked if she believed in God before she died, despite being told by investigators that the question had not been asked. Cassie&#x27;s friend Emily Wyant, who was next to her in the library when she was shot, also told the family that the question had not been asked. Despite this, the Bernalls issued a statement standing behind the accuracy of their book, saying they had spoken to four witnesses who had told them that she had defended her faith before being killed. However, the book ultimately leaves it up to the readers to make up their own mind about what happened.

=== In popular culture ===
Bernall&#x27;s presentation as a Christian martyr has led to her serving as the inspiration for several songs, including Flyleaf&#x27;s &quot;Cassie&quot; and Michael W. Smith&#x27;s &quot;This Is Your Time&quot;. The video for &quot;This Is Your Time&quot; includes a short clip at its beginning of Bernall talking about her beliefs.

<text>This article contains two versions of the list of kings of Burundi, the traditional version before 1680 and the modern genealogy. The Kingdom of Burundi was ruled by sovereigns, titled &quot;mwami&quot; (plural &quot;abami&quot;), whose regnal names followed a cycle: Ntare (meaning &#x27;lion&#x27;), Mwezi (meaning &#x27;moon&#x27;), Mutaga, and Mwambutsa. Traditionally, it was thought that there had been four complete cycles but the modern genealogy indicates that there were only two complete cycles, starting with Ntare III Rushatsi.

In the 16th century, Burundi was a kingdom characterized by a hierarchical political authority and tributary economic exchange. A &quot;mwami&quot; headed a princely aristocracy (&quot;ganwa&quot;) which owned most of the land governing its subjects with superiority and required a tribute, or tax, from local farmers and herders who lived in forests. The Tutsi monarchy ruled the nation for centuries, but became largely ceremonial with the colonization of the nation by the German Empire in 1899. The kings continued to nominally rule through German and Belgian colonial periods, and the monarchy continued after the nation gained independence from Belgium in 1962. Burundi ceased to be a monarchy when King Ntare V Ndizeye was deposed by Prime Minister and Chief of Staff, Colonel Michel Micombero, who abolished the monarchy and declared a republic following the November 1966 coup d&#x27;état.

<doc id="378618" wikidata="Q4584816" url="?curid=378618" title="Opus the Penguin">
<text>Opus the Penguin (Opus T. Penguin) is a fictional character created by artist Berkeley Breathed. Breathed has described him as an &quot;existentialist penguin&quot; and the favorite of his many characters.

Opus has appeared in several of Breathed&#x27;s creations, most notably his 1980s comic strip &quot;Bloom County&quot;. Breathed also included Opus in the sequel strip to &quot;Bloom County&quot;, &quot;Outland&quot;, and later made him the star of his own self-titled strip.

== Introduction and appearance ==
Opus was originally introduced in June 1981, as a one-time gag about hapless Mike Binkley bringing home what he thought was a German Shepherd, which turned out to be a penguin, much to the disappointment of his father. After being featured in a few strips, the character was dropped for several months, before being gradually re-introduced in January 1982, and eventually becoming a central character in Bloom County. Opus&#x27; popularity quickly grew until he became the signature character of Bloom County and of Breathed&#x27;s subsequent comic strips.

Opus&#x27; appearance changed since his inception - he originally looked like a common penguin, but between 1982 and 1986 his nose grew dramatically (developing its signature bump in the middle, of which Opus is very self-conscious). Mike Binkley, during one Sunday strip, points out the fact that Opus more closely resembles a puffin, a revelation shocking to the sensitive Opus. (In the final panel of the same strip, Opus responds by telling Binkley that he looks like a carrot.) Opus says he is attracted to &quot;svelte buoyant waterfowl&quot;.

He is usually seen wearing a bow tie and collar, though he sometimes switches to a diagonally striped necktie when running for public office. Beginning in &quot;Outland&quot; during the 1990s, he is also occasionally seen inexplicably wearing white briefs.

Opus once mentioned his height during an interview for &quot;The bureau of nosy statistics.&quot; In this comic strip he said that his height is two feet eleven inches.

== Notable storylines ==
According to Opus&#x27; back story, he is from the Falkland Islands, How he got from there to Bloom County is explained in &quot;The Night Of The Mary Kay Commandos&quot;. He was separated from his mother at a young age, and much of his personality is therefore enmeshed in his sense of abandonment and yearning for a mother figure. There is never any mention of Opus&#x27; father if he ever knew him.

Over the years Opus has served as Steve Dallas&#x27; legal secretary, journeyed to Antarctica in search of his mother, played the tuba in heavy metal group Deathtöngue (later renamed Billy and the Boingers), wooed (and was nearly married to) an abstract sculptor named Lola Granola, worked as a newspaper personals editor, lifestyle columnist and comic strip writer, had brief, experimental stints employed as a farmer, garbageman and even a cartoonist (or, as he called it, a stripper, which he would also be at one point), and run for vice president on the National Radical Meadow Party ticket, along with his running mate Bill the Cat.

In the tradition of many other popular characters, Opus apparently died (while unwillingly brought along on a balloon expedition to Washington, DC, to zap the ambassador from apartheid-era South Africa with a ray that would temporarily turn him black) only to return with amnesia. He later regained his memory after being in a state of intense and total shock; he heard an erroneous report that Diane Sawyer (on whom he had an enormous crush) had married Eddie Murphy. Another story line led Opus, in search of his mother, to a Mary Kay Cosmetics testing building, which he was shocked to find out was cruelly using animals as test subjects for various cosmetics. Another memorable story line featured Opus being the subject of moral scorn as a perpetrator of &quot;penguin lust&quot;. He fled Bloom County, and was absent for a long time, eventually reappearing lost in the desert, before his mother came to him in a hallucination and told him to return to his home. In another story, Opus wrote an autobiography, &quot;A Penguin&#x27;s Story&quot;, which nobody bought. Milo Bloom later rewrote the memoir, exaggerating and fabricating most of it, in his typical fashion. The new, scandalous memoir, entitled &quot;Naked Came I&quot;, became a bestseller in the Bloom County universe, leading Opus to even more notoriety than he had as Bill the Cat&#x27;s running mate.

A major failing of Opus is his inability to resist the temptations of television infotainment commercials, a la Ronco, with the result being that he is frequently seen receiving crateloads of useless and arcane kitchen utensils such as &quot;turnip twaddlers&quot;.

Opus also has a very amusing (but somewhat unfortunate) history of &quot;losing parts&quot;; on several occasions, his &quot;fanny&quot; has fallen off (often with a clanking sound on the floor), and he has also had instances where his nose droops or is taken completely off as a result of sneezing while using dental floss and so on. Sometimes these are combined; he has had either his nose and rear end fall off, or his nose droop while his rear end has fallen off, and so on. He eventually learned that his navel was in fact the screw that attached his rear end to his body.

Opus appeared in the Berkeley Breathed Christmas children&#x27;s book, &quot;A Wish for Wings That Work&quot;. It was later turned into a cartoon.

== Post–&quot;Bloom County&quot; ==
Opus was the second &quot;Bloom County&quot; regular to appear in the Sunday-only &quot;Outland&quot; strip, after &quot;Outland&quot;&#x27;s original protagonist, Ronald-Ann Smith. He also appeared in some of Breathed&#x27;s children&#x27;s books, including &quot;A Wish for Wings That Work&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Opus&quot;.

Eight years after &quot;Outland&quot; ended, Opus returned in a second Sunday-only strip simply titled &quot;Opus&quot;, in 2003. The first few strips showed Opus&#x27;s discontent living in Antarctica with his overbearing mother. A misdirected Mars probe happened to give him the means to return to Bloom County, where he set about looking for his old friends. To date, he has been reunited with four — Bill the Cat, Steve Dallas, and (on June 3, 2007), Michael Binkley and Oliver Wendell Jones.

According to the July 10, 2005 edition of the &quot;Opus&quot; comic strip, Opus lived at 996 Melba Lane, presumably in Bloom County.

Opus appears on the label of Honest Tea&#x27;s Peach Oo-la-long tea.

==Ending==
On October 6, 2008, Berkeley Breathed announced that he would retire the character on November 2. He added that &quot;I&#x27;ll be leaving Opus in a way that it should be very clear that this time there&#x27;s no going back home&quot; and that he felt &quot;unrealistically emotional&quot; about drawing the final &quot;Opus&quot; strip and writing a final ending.

The final strip showed Opus fast asleep in bed on the final page of &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;, Steve Dallas having opened the book in the previous strip.

==Revival==

Opus returned in the 2015 revival of &quot;Bloom County&quot;, awakening from a 25-year nap.

<doc id="378625" wikidata="Q223694" url="?curid=378625" title="War elephant">
<text>A war elephant is an elephant that is trained and guided by humans for combat purposes. Historically, the war elephant&#x27;s main use was to charge the enemy, break their ranks, and instill terror and fear. Elephantry is a term for specific military units using elephant-mounted troops. In modern times, war elephants on the battlefield were effectively made redundant by the invention of motor vehicles, particularly tanks.

== Description ==
War elephants played a critical role in several key battles in antiquity, especially in ancient India. While seeing limited and periodic use in Ancient China, they became a permanent fixture in armies of historical kingdoms in Southeast Asia. During classical antiquity they were also used in ancient Persia and in the Mediterranean world within armies of Macedon, Hellenistic Greek states, the Roman Republic and later Empire, and Ancient Carthage in North Africa. In some regions they maintained a firm presence on the battlefield throughout the Medieval era. However, their use declined with the spread of firearms and other gunpowder weaponry in early modern warfare. After this, war elephants became restricted to non-combat engineering and labour roles, as well as being used for minor ceremonial uses.

== Taming ==

An elephant trainer, rider, or keeper is called a mahout. Mahouts were responsible for capturing and handling elephants. To accomplish this, they utilize metal chains and a specialized hook called an &quot;ankus&quot;, or &#x27;elephant goad&#x27;. According to Chanakya as recorded in the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, first the mahout would have to get the elephant used to being led. The elephant would have learned how to raise its legs to help a rider climb on. Then the elephants were taught to run and maneuver around obstacles, and move in formation. These elephants would be fit to learn how to systematically trample and charge enemies.

The first elephant species to be tamed was the Asian elephant, for use in agriculture. Elephant taming – not full domestication, as they are still captured in the wild, rather than being bred in captivity – may have begun in any of three different places. The oldest evidence comes from the Indus Valley civilization, around roughly 2000 BC. Archaeological evidence for the presence of wild elephants in the Yellow River valley in Shang China () may suggest that they also used elephants in warfare. The wild elephant populations of Mesopotamia and China declined quickly because of deforestation and human population growth: by 850 BC the Mesopotamian elephants were extinct, and by 500 BC the Chinese elephants were seriously reduced in numbers and limited to areas well south of the Yellow River.

Capturing elephants from the wild remained a difficult task, but a necessary one given the difficulties of breeding in captivity and the long time required for an elephant to reach sufficient maturity to engage in battle. Sixty-year-old war elephants were always prized as being at the most suitable age for battle service and gifts of elephants of this age were seen as particularly generous. Today an elephant is considered in its prime and at the height of its power between the ages of 25 and 40, yet elephants as old as 80 are used in tiger hunts because they are more disciplined and experienced.

It is commonly thought that the reason all war elephants were male was because of males&#x27; greater aggression, but it was instead because a female elephant in battle will run from a male; therefore only males could be used in war, whereas female elephants were more commonly used for logistics. According to the First Book of Maccabees, the Seleucids used the &quot;blood of grapes and mulberries&quot; to provoke their war elephants in preparation for battle.

== Antiquity ==
=== Indian subcontinent ===
There is uncertainty as to when elephant warfare first started, but it is widely accepted that it began in ancient India. The early Vedic period did not extensively specify the use of elephants in war. However, in the Ramayana, Indra is depicted as riding either Airavata, a mythological elephant, or on the Uchchaihshravas, as his mounts. Elephants were widely utilized in warfare by the later Vedic period by the 6th century BC. The increased conscription of elephants in the military history of India coincides with the expansion of the Vedic Kingdoms into the Indo-Gangetic Plain suggesting its introduction during the intervening period. The practice of riding on elephants in peace and war, royalty or commoner, was first recorded in the 6th or 5th century BC. This practice is believed to be much older than proper recorded history.

The ancient Indian epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, dating from 5th–4th century BC, elaborately depict elephant warfare. They are recognized as an essential component of royal and military processions. In ancient India, initially, the army was fourfold (&quot;chaturanga&quot;), consisting of infantry, cavalry, elephants and chariots. Kings and princes principally ride on chariots, which was considered the most royal, while seldom riding the back of elephants. Although viewed as secondary to chariots by royalty, elephants were the preferred vehicle of warriors, especially the elite ones. While the chariots eventually fell into disuse, the other three arms continued to be valued. Many characters in the epic &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; were trained in the art. According to the rules of engagement set for the Kurukshetra War two men were to duel utilizing the same weapon and mount including elephants. In the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; the akshauhini battle formation consists of a ratio of 1 chariot : 1 elephant : 3 cavalry : 5 infantry soldiers. Many characters in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; were described as skilled in the art of elephant warfare e.g. Duryodhana rides an elephant into battle to bolster the demoralized Kaurava army. Scriptures like the &quot;Nikāya&quot; and &quot;Vinaya Pitaka&quot; assign elephants in their proper place in the organization of an army. The &quot;Samyutta Nikaya&quot; additionally mentions the Gautama Buddha being visited by a &#x27;hatthāroho gāmaṇi&#x27;. He is the head of a village community bound together by their profession as mercenary soldiers forming an elephant corp.

Ancient Indian kings certainly valued the elephant in war, some stating that an army without elephants is as despicable as a forest without a lion, a kingdom without a king, or as valor unaided by weapons. The use of elephants further increased with the rise of the Mahajanapadas. King Bimbisara (), who began the expansion of the Magadha kingdom, relied heavily on his war elephants. The Mahajanapadas would be conquered by the Nanda Empire under the reign of Mahapadma Nanda. Pliny the Elder and Plutarch also estimated the Nanda Army strength in the east as 200,000 infantry, 80,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots, and 6,000 war elephants. Alexander the Great would come in contact with the Nanda Empire on the banks of the Beas River and was forced to return due to his army&#x27;s unwillingness to advance. Even if the numbers and prowess of these elephants were exaggerated by historic accounts, elephants were established firmly as war machines in this period.

Chandragupta Maurya (321–297 BC), formed the Maurya Empire, the largest empire to exist in South Asia. At the height of his power, Chandragupta is said to have wielded a military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots and 9,000 war elephants besides followers and attendants.

In the Mauryan Empire, the 30-member war office was made up of six boards. The sixth board looked after the elephants, and were headed by &quot;Gajadhyaksha&quot;. The &quot;gajadhyaksha&quot; was the superintendent of elephants and his qualifications. The use of elephants in the Maurya Empire as recorded by Chanakya in the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;. According to Chanakya; catching, training, and controlling war elephants was one of the most important skills taught by the military academies. He advised Chandragupta to set up forested sanctuaries for the wellness of the elephants. Chanakya explicitly conveyed the importance of these sanctuaries. The Maurya Empire would reach its zenith under the reign of Ashoka, who used elephants extensively during his conquest. During the Kalinga War, Kalinga had a standing army of 60,000 infantry, 1000 cavalry and 700 war elephants. Kalinga was notable for the quality of their war elephants which were prized by its neighbors for being stronger. Later the King Kharavela was to restore an independent Kalinga into a powerful kingdom using war elephants as stated in the Hathigumpha inscription or &quot;Elephant Cave&quot; Inscriptions.Following Indian accounts foreign rulers would also adopt the use of elephants.

The Chola Empire of Tamil Nadu also had a very strong elephant force. The Chola emperor Rajendra Chola had an armored elephant force, which played a major role in his campaigns.

Sri Lanka made extensive use of elephants and also exported elephants with Pliny the Elder stating that the Sri Lankan elephants, for example, were larger, fiercer and better for war than local elephants. This superiority, as well as the proximity of the supply to seaports, made Sri Lanka&#x27;s elephants a lucrative trading commodity. Sri Lankan history records indicate elephants were used as mounts for kings leading their men in the battlefield, with individual mounts being recorded in history. The elephant Kandula was King Dutugamunu&#x27;s mount and Maha Pambata, &#x27;Big Rock&#x27;, the mount of King Ellalan during their historic encounter on the battlefield in 200 BC, for example.

=== Eastern Asia ===
Elephants were used for warfare in China by a small handful of southern dynasties. The state of Chu used elephants in 506 BC against Wu by tying torches to their tails and sending them into the ranks of the enemy soldiers, but the attempt failed. In December 554 AD, the Liang dynasty used armoured war elephants, carrying towers, against Western Wei. They were defeated by a volley of arrows. The Southern Han dynasty is the only state in Chinese history to have kept a permanent corps of war elephants. These elephants were able to carry a tower with some ten people on their backs. They were used successfully during the Han invasion of Ma Chu in 948. In 970, the Song dynasty invaded Southern Han and their crossbowmen readily routed the Han elephants on 23 January 971, during the taking of Shao. That was the last time elephants were used in Chinese warfare, although the Wanli Emperor (r. 1572–1620) did keep a herd of elephants capable of carrying a tower and eight men, which he showed to his guests in 1598. These elephants were probably not native to China and were delivered to the Ming dynasty by Southeast Asian countries such as Siam. During the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, the rebels used elephants against the Qing dynasty, but the Qing Bannermen shot them with so many arrows that they &quot;resembled porcupines&quot; and repelled the elephant charge.

Chinese armies faced off against war elephants in Southeast Asia, such as during the Sui–Lâm Ấp war (605), Lý–Song War (1075–1077), Ming–Mong Mao War (1386–1388), and Ming–Hồ War (1406–1407). In 605, the Champa kingdom of Lâm Ấp in what is now southern Vietnam used elephants against the invading army of China&#x27;s Sui dynasty. The Sui army dug pits and lured the elephants into them and shot them with crossbows, causing the elephants to turn back and trample their own army. In 1075, the Song defeated elephants deployed on the borderlands of Đại Việt during the Lý–Song War. The Song forces used scythed polearms to cut the elephants&#x27; trunks, causing them to trample their own troops. During the Mong Mao campaign, the elephants were routed by an assortment of gunpowder projectiles. In the war against the Hồ dynasty, Ming troops covered their horses with lion masks to scare the elephants and shot them with firearms. The elephants all trembled with fear and were wounded by the guns and arrows, causing the Viet army to panic.

=== Achaemenid Persia, Macedonia and Hellenistic Greek states ===
From India, military thinking on the use of war elephants spread westwards to the Persian Achaemenid Empire, where they were used in several campaigns. They in turn came to influence the campaigns of Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia in Hellenistic Greece. The first confrontation between Europeans and the Persian war elephants occurred at Alexander&#x27;s Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC), where the Persians deployed fifteen elephants. These elephants were placed at the centre of the Persian line and made such an impression on Alexander&#x27;s army that he felt the need to sacrifice to Phobos, the God of Fear, the night before the battle – but according to some sources the elephants ultimately failed to deploy in the final battle owing to their long march the day before. Alexander won resoundingly at Gaugamela, but was deeply impressed by the enemy elephants and took these first fifteen into his own army, adding to their number during his capture of the rest of Persia.

By the time Alexander reached the borders of India five years later, he had a substantial number of elephants under his own command. When it came to defeating Porus, who ruled in what is now Punjab region, Alexander found himself facing a force of between 85 and 100 war elephants at the Battle of the Hydaspes. Preferring stealth and mobility to sheer force, Alexander manoeuvered and engaged with just his infantry and cavalry, ultimately defeating Porus&#x27; forces, including his elephant corps, albeit at some cost. Porus for his part placed his elephants individually, at long intervals from each other, a short distance in front of his main infantry line, in order to scare off Macedonian cavalry attacks and aid his own infantry in their struggle against the phalanx. The elephants caused many losses with their tusks fitted with iron spikes or by lifting the enemies with their trunks and trampling them.

Arrian described the subsequent fight: &quot;[W]herever the beasts could wheel around, they rushed forth against the ranks of infantry and demolished the phalanx of the Macedonians, dense as it was.&quot;

The Macedonians adopted the standard ancient tactic for fighting elephants, loosening their ranks to allow the elephants to pass through and assailing them with javelins as they tried to wheel around; they managed to pierce the unarmoured elephants&#x27; legs. The panicked and wounded elephants turned on the Indians themselves; the mahouts were armed with poisoned rods to kill the beasts but were slain by javelins and archers.

Looking further east again, Alexander could see that the emperors and kings of the Nanda Empire and Gangaridai could deploy between 3,000 and 6,000 war elephants. Such a force was many times larger than the number of elephants employed by the Persians and Greeks, which probably discouraged Alexander&#x27;s army and effectively halted their advance into India. On his return, Alexander established a force of elephants to guard his palace at Babylon, and created the post of &quot;elephantarch&quot; to lead his elephant units.

The successful military use of elephants spread further. The successors to Alexander&#x27;s empire, the Diadochi, used hundreds of Indian elephants in their wars, with the Seleucid Empire being particularly notable for their use of the animals, still being largely brought from India. Indeed, the Seleucid–Mauryan war of 305–303 BC ended with the Seleucids ceding vast eastern territories in exchange for 500 war elephants – a small part of the Mauryan forces, which included up to 9000 elephants by some accounts. The Seleucids put their new elephants to good use at the Battle of Ipsus four years later, where they blocked the return of the victorious Antigonid cavalry, allowing the latter&#x27;s phalanx to be isolated and defeated.

The first use of war elephants in Europe was made in 318 BC by Polyperchon, one of Alexander&#x27;s generals, when he besieged Megalopolis in the Peloponnesus during the wars of the Diadochi. He used 60 elephants brought from Asia with their mahouts. A veteran of Alexander&#x27;s army, named Damis, helped the besieged Megalopolitians to defend themselves against the elephants and eventually Polyperchon was defeated. Those elephants were subsequently taken by Cassander and transported, partly by sea, to other battlefields in Greece. It is assumed that Cassander constructed the first elephant transport sea vessels. Some of the elephants died of starvation in 316 BC in the besieged city of Pydna in Macedonia. Others of Polyperchon&#x27;s elephants were used in various parts of Greece by Cassander.

Although the use of war elephants in the western Mediterranean is most famously associated with the wars between Carthage and Roman Republic, the introduction of war elephants there was primarily the result of an invasion by Hellenistic era Epirus across the Adriatic Sea. King Pyrrhus of Epirus brought twenty elephants to attack Roman Italy at the battle of Heraclea in 280 BC, leaving fifty additional animals, on loan from Ptolemaic Pharaoh Ptolemy II, on the mainland. The Romans were unprepared for fighting elephants, and the Epirot forces routed the Romans. The next year, the Epirots again deployed a similar force of elephants, attacking the Romans at the battle of Asculum. This time the Romans came prepared with flammable weapons and anti-elephant devices: these were ox-drawn wagons, equipped with long spikes to wound the elephants, pots of fire to scare them, and accompanying screening troops who would hurl javelins at the elephants to drive them away. A final charge of Epirot elephants won the day again, but this time Pyrrhus had suffered very heavy casualties – a Pyrrhic victory.

The Seleucid king Antiochus V Eupator, whose father and he contended with Ptolemaic Egypt&#x27;s ruler Ptolemy VI for control of Syria, invaded Judea in 161 BCE with eighty elephants (some sources claim thirty-two), some of which were clad in armoured breastplates, in an attempt to subdue the Jews who had revolted during the Maccabean Revolt. In the ensuing battle, near the mountainous straights adjacent to Beth Zachariah, Eleazar, brother of Judas Maccabeus, attacked the largest of the elephants, piercing its underside and causing it to collapse upon him, killing him under its weight.

=== North Africa ===
The North African elephant was a significant animal in Nubian culture. They were depicted on the walls of temples and on Meroitic lamps. Kushite kings also utilize war elephants, which are believed to have been kept and trained in the &quot;Great Enclosure&quot; at Musawwarat al-Sufa. The Kingdom of Kush provided these war elephants to the Egyptians, Ptolemies and Syrians.

The Ptolemaic Egypt and the Punics began acquiring African elephants for the same purpose, as did Numidia and the Kingdom of Kush. The animal used was the North African elephant (&quot;Loxodonta africana pharaohensis&quot;) which would become extinct from overexploitation. These animals were smaller and harder to tame, and could not swim deep rivers compared with the Asian elephants used by the Seleucid Empire on the east of the Mediterranean region, particularly Syrian elephants, which stood at the shoulder. It is likely that at least some Syrian elephants were traded abroad. The favourite, and perhaps last surviving, elephant of Hannibal&#x27;s crossing of the Alps was an animal named &quot;Surus&quot; (&quot;the Syrian&quot;), which may have been of Syrian stock, though the evidence remains ambiguous.

Since the late 1940s, a strand of scholarship has argued that the African forest elephants used by Numidia, the Ptolemies and the military of Carthage did not carry howdahs or turrets in combat, perhaps owing to the physical weakness of the species. Some allusions to turrets in ancient literature are certainly anachronistic or poetic invention, but other references are less easily discounted. There is contemporary testimony that the army of Juba I of Numidia included turreted elephants in 46 BC. This is backed by the image of a turreted African elephant used on the coinage of Juba II. This also appears to be the case with Ptolemaic armies: Polybius reports that at the battle of Raphia in 217 BC the elephants of Ptolemy IV carried turrets; these elephants were significantly smaller than the Asian elephants fielded by the Seleucids and so presumably African forest elephants. There is also evidence that Carthaginian war elephants were furnished with turrets and howdahs in certain military contexts.

Farther south, tribes would have had access to the African savanna elephant (&quot;Loxodonta africana oxyotis&quot;). Although much larger than either the African forest elephant or the Asian elephant, these proved difficult to tame for war purposes and were not used extensively. Asian elephants were traded westwards to the Mediterranean markets with Sri Lankan elephants being particularly preferred for war.

Perhaps inspired by the victories of Pyrrhus of Epirus, Carthage developed its own use of war elephants and deployed them extensively during the First and Second Punic Wars. The performance of the Carthaginian elephant corps was mixed, illustrating the need for proper tactics to take advantage of the elephant&#x27;s strength and cover its weaknesses. At Adyss in 255 BC, the Carthaginian elephants were ineffective due to the terrain, while at the battle of Panormus in 251 BC the Romans&#x27; velites were able to terrify the Carthaginian elephants being used unsupported, which fled from the field. At the battle of Tunis the charge of the Carthaginian elephants helped to disorder the Roman legions, allowing the Carthaginian phalanx to stand fast and defeat them. During the Second Punic War, Hannibal led an army of war elephants across the Alps. Many of them perished in the harsh conditions but the surviving elephants were successfully used in the battle of Trebia, where they panicked the Roman cavalry and Gallic allies. The Romans eventually developed effective anti-elephant tactics, leading to Hannibal&#x27;s defeat at his final battle of Zama in 202 BC; his elephant charge, unlike the one at the battle of Tunis, was ineffective because the disciplined Roman maniples made way for them to pass.

=== Rome ===

Rome brought back many elephants at the end of the Punic Wars, and used them in its campaigns for many years afterwards. The conquest of Greece saw many battles in which the Romans deployed war elephants, including the invasion of Macedonia in 199 BC, the battle of Cynoscephalae 197 BC, the battle of Thermopylae, and the battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, during which Antiochus III&#x27;s fifty-four elephants took on the Roman force of sixteen. In later years the Romans deployed twenty-two elephants at Pydna in 168 BC. The role of the elephant force at Cynoscephalae was particularly decisive, as their quick charge shattered the unformed Macedonian left wing, allowing the Romans to encircle and destroy the victorious Macedonian right. A similar event also occurred at Pydna. The Romans&#x27; successful use of war elephants against the Macedonians might be considered ironic, given that it was Pyrrhus who first taught them the military potential of elephants.

Elephants also featured throughout the Roman campaign against the Lusitanians and Celtiberians in Hispania. During the Second Celtiberian War, Quintus Fulvius Nobilior was helped by ten elephants sent by king Masinissa of Numidia. He deployed them against the Celtiberian forces of Numantia, but a falling stone hit one of the elephants, which panicked and frightened the rest, turning them against the Roman forces. After the subsequent Celtiberian counterattack, the Romans were forced to withdraw. Later, Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus marched against Viriathus with another ten elephants sent by king Micipsa. However, the Lusitanian style of ambushes in narrow terrains ensured his elephants did not play an important factor in the conflict, and Servilianus was eventually defeated by Viriathus in the city of Erisana.

The Romans used a war elephant in their first invasion of Britain, one ancient writer recording that &quot;Caesar had one large elephant, which was equipped with armour and carried archers and slingers in its tower. When this unknown creature entered the river, the Britons and their horses fled and the Roman army crossed over&quot; – although he may have confused this incident with the use of a war elephant in Claudius&#x27; final conquest of Britain. At least one elephant skeleton with flint weapons found in England was initially misidentified as one of these elephants, but later dating proved it to be a mammoth skeleton from the Stone Age.

In the African campaign of the Roman civil war of 49–45 BC, the army of Metellus Scipio used elephants against Caesar&#x27;s army at the battle of Thapsus. Scipio trained his elephants before the battle by aligning the elephants in front of slingers that would throw rocks at them, and another line of slingers at the elephants&#x27; rear to perform the same, in order to propel the elephants only in one direction, preventing them turning their backs because of frontal attack and charging against his own lines, but the author of De Bello Africano admits of the enormous effort and time required to accomplish this.

By the time of Claudius, such animals were being used by the Romans in single numbers only – the last significant use of war elephants in the Mediterranean was against the Romans at the battle of Thapsus, 46 BC, where Julius Caesar armed his fifth legion (&quot;Alaudae&quot;) with axes and commanded his legionaries to strike at the elephant&#x27;s legs. The legion withstood the charge, and the elephant became its symbol. The remainder of the elephants seemed to have been thrown into panic by Caesar&#x27;s archers and slingers.

=== Parthia and Sassanian Persia ===

The Parthian Empire occasionally used war elephants in their battles against the Roman Empire, but elephants were of substantial importance in the army of the subsequent Sassanid Empire. The Sasanian war elephants are recorded in engagements against the Romans, such as during Julian&#x27;s invasion of Persia. Other examples include the Battle of Vartanantz in 451 AD, at which the Sassanid elephants terrified the Armenians, and the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah of 636 AD, in which a unit of thirty-three elephants was used against the invading Arab Muslims.

The Sassanid elephant corps held primacy amongst the Sassanid cavalry forces and was recruited from India. The elephant corps was under a special chief, known as the &quot;Zend−hapet&quot;, meaning &quot;Commander of the Indians&quot;, either because the animals came from that country, or because they were managed by natives of Hindustan. The Sassanid elephant corps was never on the same scale as others further east, and after the fall of the Sassanid Empire the use of war elephants died out in the region.

=== Aksumite Empire ===
The Kingdom of Aksum in what is now Ethiopia and Eritrea made use of war elephants in 525 AD during the invasion of the Himyarite Kingdom in the Arabian peninsula. The war elephants used by the Aksumite army consisted of African savannah elephants, a significantly larger and more temperamental species of elephant. War elephants were again put to use by an Aksumite army in 570 in a military expedition against the Quraysh of Mecca.

== Middle Ages ==
The Kushan Empire conquered most of Northern India. The empire adopted war elephants when levying troops as they expanded into the Indian subcontinent. The Weilüe describes how the population of Eastern India rode elephants into battle, but currently they provide military service and taxes to the Yuezhi (Kushans). The Hou Hanshu additionally describes the Kushan as acquiring riches including elephants as part of their conquests. The emperor Kanishka assembled a great army from his subject nations, including elephants from India. He planned on attacking the Tarim Kingdoms, and sent a vanguard of Indian troops led by white elephants. However, when crossing the Pamir Mountains the elephants and horses in the vanguard were unwilling to advance. Kanishka is then said to have had a religious revelation and rejected violence.

The Gupta Empire demonstrated extensive use of elephants in war and greatly expanded under the reign of Samudragupta. Local squads which each consisted of one elephant, one chariot, three armed cavalrymen, and five foot soldiers protected Gupta villages from raids and revolts. In times of war, the squads joined together to form a powerful imperial army. The Gupta Empire employed &#x27;Mahapilupati&#x27;, a position as an officer in charge of elephants. Emperors such as Kumaragupta struck coins depicted as elephant riders and lion slayers.

Harsha established hegemony over most of North India. The Harshacharita composed by Bāṇabhaṭṭa describes the army under the rule of Harsha. Much like the Gupta Empire, his military consisted of infantry, cavalry, and elephants. Harsha received war elephants as tribute and presents from vassals. Some elephants were also obtained by forest rangers from the jungles. Elephants were additionally taken from defeated armies. Bana additionally details the diet of the elephants, recording that they each consumed 600 pounds of fodder consisting of trees with mangos and sugarcanes.

The Chola dynasty and the Western Chalukya Empire maintained a large number of war elephants in the 11th and 12th century. The war elephants of the Chola dynasty carried on their backs fighting towers which were filled with soldiers who would shoot arrows at long range. The army of the Pala Empire was noted for its huge elephant corps, with estimates ranging from 5,000 to 50,000.

The Ghaznavids were the first amongst the Islamic dynasties to incorporate war elephants into their tactical theories. They also used a large number of elephants in their battles. The Ghaznavids acquired their elephants as tribute from the Hindu princes and as war plunder. The sources usually list the number of beasts captured, and these frequently ran into hundreds, such as 350 from Qanauj and 185 from Mahaban in 409/1018-19, and 580 from the Raja Ganda in 410/1019-20. Utbi records that the Thanesar expedition of 405/1014-15 was provoked by Mahmad&#x27;s desire to get some of the special breed of Sri lankan breed of elephants excellent in war 

In 1526, Babur, a descendant of Timur, invaded India and established the Mughal Empire. Babur introduced firearms and artillery into Indian warfare. He destroyed the army of Ibrahim Lodi at the First Battle of Panipat and the army of Rana Sanga in 1527 at the Battle of Khanua. The great Moghul Emperor Akbar (r. 1556–1605 AD) had 32,000 elephants in his stables. Jahangir, (reigned 1605–1627 A.D.) was a great connoisseur of elephants. He increased the number of elephants in service. Jahangir was stated to have 113,000 elephants in captivity: 12,000 in active army service, 1,000 to supply fodder to these animals, and another 100,000 elephants to carry courtiers, officials, attendants and baggage.

King Rajasinghe I laid siege to the Portuguese fort at Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 1558 with an army containing 2,200 elephants, used for logistics and siege work. The Sri Lankans had continued their proud traditions in capturing and training elephants from ancient times. The officer in charge of the royal stables, including the capture of elephants, was called the &quot;Gajanayake Nilame&quot;, while the post of &quot;Kuruve Lekham&quot; controlled the Kuruwe or elephant men. The training of war elephants was the duty of the Kuruwe clan who came under their own Muhandiram, a Sri Lankan administrative post.

In Islamic history there is a significant event known as the &quot;‘Am al-Fil&quot; (, &quot;Year of the Elephant&quot;), approximately equating to 570 AD. At that time Abraha, the Christian ruler of Yemen, marched upon the Ka‘bah in Mecca, intending to demolish it. He had a large army, which included one or more elephants (as many as eight, in some accounts). However, the (single or lead) elephant, whose name was &#x27;Mahmud&#x27;, is said to have stopped at the boundary around Mecca, and refused to enter – which was taken by both the Meccans and their Yemenite foes as a serious omen. According to Islamic tradition, it was in this year that Muhammad was born.

In the Middle Ages, elephants were seldom used in Europe. Charlemagne took his one elephant, Abul-Abbas, when he went to fight the Danes in 804, and the Crusades gave Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II the opportunity to capture an elephant in the Holy Land, the same animal later being used in the capture of Cremona in 1214, but the use of these individual animals was more symbolic than practical, especially when contrasting food and water consumption of elephants in foreign lands and the harsh conditions of the crusades.

The Mongols faced war-elephants in Khorazm, Burma, Siam, Vietnam, Cambodia and India throughout the 13th century. Despite their unsuccessful campaigns in Vietnam and India, the Mongols defeated the war elephants outside Samarkand by using catapults and mangonels, and during the Mongol invasions of Burma in 1277–1287 and 1300–1302 by showering arrows from their famous composite bows. Genghis and Kublai both retained captured elephants as part of their entourage. Another central Asian invader, Timur faced similar challenges a century later. In the Sack of Delhi, Timur&#x27;s army faced more than one hundred Indian elephants in battle and almost lost because of the fear they caused amongst his troops. Historical accounts say that the Timurids ultimately won by employing an ingenious strategy: Timur tied flaming straw to the back of his camels before the charge. The smoke made the camels run forward, scaring the elephants, who crushed their own troops in their efforts to retreat. Another account of the campaign by Ahmed ibn Arabshah reports that Timur used oversized caltrops to halt the elephants&#x27; charge. Later, the Timurid leader used the captured animals against the Ottoman Empire.

In Southeast Asia, the powerful Khmer Empire had come to regional dominance by the 9th century AD, drawing heavily on the use of war elephants. Uniquely, the Khmer military deployed double cross-bows on the top of their elephants. With the collapse of Khmer power in the 15th century, the successor region powers of Burma (now Myanmar) and Siam (now Thailand) also adopted the widespread use of war elephants. In many battles of the period it was the practice for leaders to fight each other personally in elephant duels. One famous battle occurred when the Burmese army attacked Siam&#x27;s Kingdom of Ayutthaya. The war may have been concluded when the Burmese crown prince Mingyi Swa was killed by Siamese King Naresuan in personal combat on elephant in 1593. However, this duel may be apocryphal.

In Thailand, the king or general rode on the elephant&#x27;s neck and carried ngaw, a long pole with a sabre at the end, plus a metal hook for controlling the elephant. Sitting behind him on a howdah, was a signaller, who signalled by waving of a pair of peacock feathers. Above the signaller was the &quot;chatras&quot;, consisting of progressively stacked circular canopies, the number signifying the rank of the rider. Finally, behind the signaller on the elephant&#x27;s back, was the steerer, who steered via a long pole. The steerer may have also carried a short musket and a sword.

In Malaysia, 20 elephants battled the Portuguese during the Capture of Malacca (1511).

The Chinese continued to reject the use of war elephants throughout the period, with the notable exception of the Southern Han during the 10th century AD – the &quot;only nation on Chinese soil ever to maintain a line of elephants as a regular part of its army&quot;. This anomaly in Chinese warfare is explained by the geographical proximity and close cultural links of the southern Han to Southeast Asia. The military officer who commanded these elephants was given the title &quot;Legate Digitant and Agitant of the Gigantic Elephants&quot;. Each elephant supported a wooden tower that could allegedly hold ten or more men. For a brief time, war elephants played a vital role in Southern Han victories such as the invasion of Chu in 948 AD, but the Southern Han elephant corps were ultimately soundly defeated at Shao in 971 AD, defeated by crossbow shooting from troops of the Song dynasty. As one academic has put it, &quot;thereafter this exotic introduction into Chinese culture passed out of history, and the tactical habits of the North prevailed&quot;. However, as late as the Ming dynasty in as far north as Beijing, there were still records of elephants being used in Chinese warfare, namely in 1449 where a Vietnamese contingent of war elephants helped the Ming dynasty defend the city from the Mongols.

== Modern era ==


With the advent of gunpowder warfare in the late 15th century, the balance of advantage for war elephants on the battlefield began to change. While muskets had limited impact on elephants, which could withstand numerous volleys, cannon fire was a different matter entirelyan animal could easily be knocked down by a single shot. With elephants still being used to carry commanders on the battlefield, they became even more tempting targets for enemy artillery.

Nonetheless, in south-east Asia the use of elephants on the battlefield continued up until the end of the 19th century. One of the major difficulties in the region was terrain, and elephants could cross difficult terrain in many cases more easily than horse cavalry. Burmese forces used war elephants against the Chinese in the Sino-Burmese War where they routed the Chinese cavalry. The Burmese used them again during the Battle of Danubyu during the First Anglo-Burmese War, where the elephants were easily repulsed by Congreve rockets deployed by British forces. The Siamese Army continued utilising war elephants armed with jingals up until the Franco-Siamese conflict of 1893, while the Vietnamese used them in battle as late as 1885, during the Sino-French War. During the mid to late 19th century, British forces in India possessed specialised elephant batteries to haul large siege artillery pieces over ground unsuitable for oxen.

Into the 20th century, military elephants were used for non-combat purposes in the Second World War, particularly because the animals could perform tasks in regions that were problematic for motor vehicles. Sir William Slim, commander of the XIVth Army wrote about elephants in his introduction to &quot;Elephant Bill&quot;: &quot;They built hundreds of bridges for us, they helped to build and launch more ships for us than Helen ever did for Greece. Without them our retreat from Burma would have been even more arduous and our advance to its liberation slower and more difficult.&quot; Military elephants were used as late as the Vietnam War.

Elephants were as of 2017 being used by the Kachin Independence Army for an auxiliary role.
Elephants are now more valuable to many armies in failing states for their ivory than as transport, and many thousands of elephants have died during civil conflicts due to poaching. They are classed as a pack animal in a U.S. Special Forces field manual issued as recently as 2004, but their use by U.S. personnel is discouraged because elephants are endangered.

== Tactical use ==
There were many military purposes for which elephants could be used. In battle, war elephants were usually deployed in the centre of the line, where they could be useful to prevent a charge or to conduct one of their own. Their sheer size and their terrifying appearance made them valued heavy cavalry. Off the battlefield they could carry heavy materiel, and with a top speed of approximately provided a useful means of transport, before mechanized vehicles rendered them mostly obsolete.

In addition to charging, elephants could provide a safe and stable platform for archers to shoot arrows in the middle of the battlefield, from which more targets could be seen and engaged. The driver, called a mahout, was responsible for controlling the animal, who often also carried weapons himself, like a chisel-blade and a hammer (to kill his own mount in an emergency). Elephants were sometimes further enhanced with their own weaponry and armour as well. In India and Sri Lanka, heavy iron chains with steel balls at the end were tied to their trunks, which the animals were trained to swirl menacingly and with great skill. Numerous cultures designed specialized equipment for elephants, like tusk swords and a protective tower on their backs, called howdahs. The late sixteenth century saw the introduction of culverins, jingals and rockets against elephants, innovations that would ultimately drive these animals out of active service on the battlefield.

Besides the dawn of more efficient means of transportation and weaponry, war elephants also had clear tactical weaknesses that lead to their eventual retirement. After sustaining painful wounds, or when their driver was killed, elephants had the tendency to panic, often causing them to run amok indiscriminately, making casualties on either side. Experienced Roman infantrymen often tried to sever their trunks, causing instant distress, and possibly leading the elephant to flee back into its own lines. Fast skirmishers armed with javelins were also used by the Romans to drive them away, as well as flaming objects or a stout line of long spears, such as Triarii. Another method for disrupting elephant units in classical antiquity was the deployment of war pigs. Ancient writers believed that elephants could be &quot;scared by the smallest squeal of a pig&quot;. Some warlords, however, interpreted this expression literally. At the siege of Megara during the Diadochi wars, for example, the Megarians reportedly poured oil on a herd of pigs, set them alight, and drove them towards the enemy&#x27;s massed war elephants, which subsequently bolted in terror.

The value of war elephants in battle remains a contested issue. In the 19th century, it was fashionable to contrast the western, Roman focus on infantry and discipline with the eastern, exotic use of war elephants that relied merely on psychological tactics to defeat their enemy. One writer commented that war elephants &quot;have been found to be skittish and easily alarmed by unfamiliar sounds and for this reason they were found prone to break ranks and flee&quot;. Nonetheless, the continued use of war elephants for several thousand years attests to their enduring value to the historical battlefield commander.

== Cultural legacy ==

The use of war elephants over the centuries has left a deep cultural legacy in many countries. Many traditional war games incorporate war elephants. There is piece in chess called Elephant. While Englishmen call that piece bishop, it is called &quot;Gajam&quot; in Sanskrit. In Malayalam, it is called Aana (ആന), meaning elephant. In Russian, too, it is an elephant (Слон). In Bengali, the bishop is called &quot;hati&quot;, Bengali for &quot;elephant&quot;. It is called an elephant in Chinese chess. In Arabic – and derived from it, in Spanish – the bishop piece is called &quot;al-fil&quot;, Arabic for &quot;elephant&quot;.

In the Japanese game shogi, there used to be a piece known as the &quot;Drunken Elephant&quot;; it was, however, dropped by order of the Emperor Go-Nara and no longer appears in the version played in today&#x27;s Japan.

Elephant armour, originally designed for use in war, is today usually only seen in museums. One particularly fine set of Indian elephant armour is preserved at the Leeds Royal Armouries Museum, while Indian museums across the sub-continent display other fine pieces. The architecture of India also shows the deep impact of elephant warfare over the years. War elephants adorn many military gateways, such as those at Lohagarh Fort for example, while some spiked, anti-elephant gates still remain, for example at Kumbhalgarh fort. Across India, older gateways are invariably much higher than their European equivalents, in order to allow elephants with howdahs to pass through underneath.

War elephants also remain a popular artistic trope, either in the Orientalist painting tradition of the 19th century, or in literature following Tolkien, who popularised a fantastic rendition of war elephants in the form of &#x27;oliphaunts&#x27; or &quot;mûmakil&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Hathi from &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; by Rudyard Kipling is a former Indian war elephant who pulled heavy artillery for the British Indian Army. Kala-Nag from &quot;Toomai of the Elephants&quot; performed similar duties during the First Anglo-Afghan War.

Numerous strategy video games feature elephants as special units, usually available only to specific factions or requiring special resources.

<doc id="378634" wikidata="Q379324" url="?curid=378634" title="Advanced Authoring Format">
<text>The Advanced Authoring Format (AAF) is a file format for professional cross-platform data interchange, designed for the video post-production and authoring environment. It was created by the Advanced Media Workflow Association (AMWA), and is now being standardized through the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE).

== History ==
AAF was originally created by the AMWA, formerly the AAF Association Inc., a trade association created to develop and promote adoption of specifications and technologies, such as AAF, Material Exchange Format (MXF), and Service-oriented architecture (SOA), to facilitate the deployment and operation of efficient media workflows. Technical work of the AMWA is through projects that aim to improve compatibility between AAF, Broadcast Exchange Format (BXF), MXF and XML. The current projects fall into three categories: data models, interface specifications, and application specifications.

AAF was created to help address the problem of multi-vendor, cross-platform interoperability for computer-based digital video production.

The AAF Object Model is now being standardized through SMPTE, including a better definition of the mapping between MXF and AAF essence.

== Usage ==

Capabilities of AAF include the following:

* Allows complex relationships to be described in terms of an object model. 
* Facilitates the interchange of metadata and/or program content.
* Provides a way to track the history of a piece of program content from its source elements through final production.
* Makes downstream rendering possible (with appropriate equipment). 
* Provides a convenient way to &quot;wrap&quot; all elements of a project together for archiving.

There are two kinds of data that can be interchanged using AAF:

* Essence Data: Audio (including music), video, image, graphics, text, animation, and other forms of multimedia data. So named because they are the essential data within a multimedia program that can be perceived directly by the audience.
* Metadata: Data that provides information on how to combine or modify individual sections of essence data, or that provides supplementary information about essence data. The metadata in an AAF file can provide the information needed to combine and modify the sections of essence data in the AAF file to produce a complete multimedia program.

By preserving source referencing, and abstracting the creative decisions that are made, AAF tries to improve workflow and simplify project management.

AAF&#x27;s rich data model combining metadata and various types of essence has led to its use in non-broadcast applications as well. For example, AAF has been adopted by the DoD/IC Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB) for their Aerial Surveillance and Photogrammetry Applications standard (ASPA).

==Elements of AAF==
The core elements of the AAF specification include:

* The AAF Object Specification, which defines the structured container by which AAF stores essence data and metadata using an object-oriented model. It defines the logical contents of the objects and the rules for how the objects relate to each other.
*The AAF Low-Level Container Specification, which describes how each object is stored on disk. It uses Structured Storage, a file storage system developed by Microsoft, to store the objects on disk.
* The AAF API Specification, which defines how software engineers can write applications.
* The AAF Reference Implementation, which implements both these specifications in a completely cross-platform manner.
* The AAF Software Development Kit (SDK), which includes developer utilities and validation test suites.
* The AAF Example software, which demonstrates how to use the AAF SDK to produce AAF files.
* The AAF Example files, created by working AAF implementations.

== Differences from MXF ==
AAF is designed to be a data representation of works in progress, as compared to Material Exchange Format (MXF), which is for exchanging finished media products. While MXF uses a Key Length Value (KLV) format for storage, AAF uses the Microsoft Structured Storage system.

MXF was developed as a subtype of the AAF data model, under a zero-divergence policy, which allows for workflows that mix AAF and MXF. Specifically, all MXF metadata can be understood by AAF, but not all AAF metadata can be understood by MXF (and would be filtered out during encoding as a result).

<doc id="378636" wikidata="Q15143481" url="?curid=378636" title="Honey bee life cycle">
<text>The honey bee life cycle, here referring exclusively to the domesticated Western honey bee, depends greatly on their social structure.

==Honey bee colony life==
Unlike a bumble bee colony or a paper wasp colony, the life of a honey bee colony is . The three types of honey bees in a hive are: queens (egg-producers), workers (non-reproducing females), and drones (males whose main duty is to find and mate with a queen). Unlike the worker bees, drones do not sting. Honey bee larvae hatch from eggs in three to four days. They are then fed by worker bees and develop through several stages in hexagonal cells made of beeswax. Cells are capped by worker bees when the larva pupates. Queens and drones are larger than workers, so require larger cells to develop. A colony may typically consist of tens of thousands of individuals.

While some colonies live in hives provided by humans, so-called &quot;wild&quot; colonies (although all honey bees remain wild, even when cultivated and managed by humans) typically prefer a nest site that is clean, dry, protected from the weather, about in volume with a entrance about above the ground, and preferably facing south or south-east (in the Northern Hemisphere) or north or north-east (in the Southern Hemisphere).

==Development==

Development from egg to emerging bee varies among queens, workers, and drones. Queens emerge from their cells in 15–16 days, workers in 21 days, and drones in 24 days. Only one queen is usually present in a hive. New virgin queens develop in enlarged cells through differential feeding of royal jelly by workers. When the existing queen ages or dies or the colony becomes very large, a new queen is raised by the worker bees. When the hive is too large, the old queen will take half the colony with her in a swarm. This occurs a few days prior to the new queen emerging. If several queens emerge they will begin piping (a high buzzing noise) signaling their location for the other virgin queens to come fight. Once one has eliminated the others, she will go around the hive chewing the sides of any other queen cells and stinging and killing the pupae. The queen takes one or several nuptial flights to mate with drones from other colonies, which die after mating. After mating, the queen begins laying eggs. A fertile queen is able to lay fertilized or unfertilized eggs. Each unfertilized egg contains a unique combination of 50% of the queen&#x27;s genes and develops into a (haploid) drone. The fertilized eggs develop into either (diploid) workers or queens (if fed exclusively royal jelly).

Every honey bee (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) in a hive exists to perform specific duties determined by their sex and age. Like every member of its colony, the nurse honey bee plays a vital role in the survival of its hive. Nurse bees are charged with the care and feeding of the queen and the next generation.

The average lifespan of a queen is three to four years; drones usually die upon mating or are expelled from the hive before the winter; and workers may live for a few weeks in the summer and several months in areas with an extended winter.

<doc id="378644" wikidata="Q1969668" url="?curid=378644" title="List of heads of state of the Central African Republic">
<text>This article lists the heads of state of the Central African Republic. There have been seven heads of state of the Central African Republic and the Central African Empire since independence was obtained from France on 13 August 1960. This list includes not only those persons who were sworn into office as President of the Central African Republic but also those who served as &quot;de facto&quot; heads of state.

Jean-Bédel Bokassa served as a &quot;de facto&quot; head of state (and also reigned as emperor from 1976 to 1979), while David Dacko (who served as &quot;de facto&quot; head of state from 1979 to 1981), André Kolingba, Ange-Félix Patassé, and François Bozizé were elected into office at some point during their tenure. To date, Kolingba is the only former head of state of the Central African Republic to voluntarily step down from the office through a democratic process, following the 1993 general election.

The current president of the Central African Republic is Faustin-Archange Touadéra, since 30 March 2016.

== Succession ==
Before the adoption of the 2023 constitution, the president of the National Assembly was the constitutional successor of the president in the event of a vacancy.

== Term ==
Before the adoption of the 2023 constitution, there was a two-term limit for the president in the Constitution of the Central African Republic. The term limit was not met by any president. The constitution of 2023 removed term-limits and extended the presidential term from five years to seven years.

== List of officeholders ==

== Footnotes ==
* Dacko became the official President of the Central African Republic after defeating Abel Goumba in an internal power struggle. Dacko had support from the French government.
* Bokassa seized power by staging a coup d&#x27;état from 31 December 1965 until 1 January 1966. Bokassa forced Dacko to officially resign from the presidency at 03:20 WAT (02:20 UTC) on 1 January.
* Bokassa staged a military coup against the Dacko government on 31 December 1965 – 1 January 1966. After becoming president, Bokassa took control of MESAN and imposed one-party rule under MESAN.
* Bokassa, then-president for life of the Central African Republic, instituted a new constitution at the session of the MESAN congress and declared the republic a monarchy, the Central African Empire (CAE). Bokassa became the emperor of the CAE as &quot;Bokassa I&quot;.
* By 1979, French support for Bokassa had all but eroded after the government&#x27;s brutal suppression of rioting in Bangui and massacre of schoolchildren who had protested against wearing the expensive, government-required school uniforms. Dacko, who was Bokassa&#x27;s personal adviser at the time, managed to leave for Paris where the French convinced him to cooperate in a coup to remove Bokassa from power and restore him to the presidency. The French successfully executed Operation Barracuda on 20–21 September 1979 and installed Dacko as president.
* General Kolingba (who was also the armed forces chief of staff) overthrew Dacko from the presidency in a bloodless coup.
* On 21 September 1985, Kolingba dissolved the Military Committee for National Recovery, and created the positions of head of state and president.
* A constitution was adopted by a referendum on 21 November 1986 and Kolingba was elected to a six-year term in office.
* The country held a multiparty presidential election on 22 August and 19 September 1993. Patassé was the candidate from the Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People party and ran on the platform that he would pay the previously withheld salaries to soldiers and civil servants. Patassé defeated Dacko, Kolingba, Bozizé and Abel Goumba to win the election.
* Bozizé&#x27;s second coup attempt was successful; he seized power in Bangui on 15 March 2003.
* Djotodia ousted Bozizé in the 2012–13 conflict; he seized power in Bangui on 24 March 2013.
* Under pressure from other central African heads of state gathered for a crisis summit on the situation in CAR, Djotodia resigned in N&#x27;Djamena, Chad on 10 January 2014.

<doc id="378645" wikidata="Q907248" url="?curid=378645" title="Endotherm">
<text>An endotherm (from Greek ἔνδον &quot;endon&quot; &quot;within&quot; and θέρμη &quot;thermē&quot; &quot;heat&quot;) is an organism that maintains its body at a metabolically favorable temperature, largely by the use of heat released by its internal bodily functions instead of relying almost purely on ambient heat. Such internally generated heat is mainly an incidental product of the animal&#x27;s routine metabolism, but under conditions of excessive cold or low activity an endotherm might apply special mechanisms adapted specifically to heat production. Examples include special-function muscular exertion such as shivering, and uncoupled oxidative metabolism, such as within brown adipose tissue.

Only birds and mammals are considered truly endothermic groups of animals. However, Argentine black and white tegu, leatherback sea turtles, lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes, cicadas, and winter moths are mesothermic. Unlike mammals and birds, some reptiles, particularly some species of python and tegu, possess seasonal reproductive endothermy in which they are endothermic only during their reproductive season.

In common parlance, endotherms are characterized as &quot;warm-blooded&quot;. The opposite of endothermy is ectothermy, although in general, there is no absolute or clear separation between the nature of endotherms and ectotherms.

==Origin==
Endothermy was thought to have originated towards the end of the Permian Period. One recent study claimed the origin of endothermy within Synapsida (the mammalian lineage) was among Mammaliamorpha, a node calibrated during the Late Triassic period, about 233 million years ago. Another study instead argued that endothermy only appeared later, during the Middle Jurassic, among crown-group mammals.

Evidence for endothermy has been found in basal synapsids (&quot;pelycosaurs&quot;), pareiasaurs, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, and basal archosauromorphs. Even the earliest amniotes might have been endotherms.

==Mechanisms==

===Generating and conserving heat===
Many endotherms have a larger amount of mitochondria per cell than ectotherms. This enables them to generate heat by increasing the rate at which they metabolize fats and sugars. Accordingly, to sustain their higher metabolism, endothermic animals typically require several times as much food as ectothermic animals do, and usually require a more sustained supply of metabolic fuel.

In many endothermic animals, a controlled temporary state of hypothermia conserves energy by permitting the body temperature to drop nearly to ambient levels. Such states may be brief, regular circadian cycles called torpor, or they might occur in much longer, even seasonal, cycles called hibernation. The body temperatures of many small birds (e.g. hummingbirds) and small mammals (e.g. tenrecs) fall dramatically during daily inactivity, such as nightly in diurnal animals or during the day in nocturnal animals, thus reducing the energy cost of maintaining body temperature. Less drastic intermittent reduction in body temperature also occurs in other larger endotherms; for example human metabolism also slows down during sleep, causing a drop in core temperature, commonly of the order of 1 degree Celsius. There may be other variations in temperature, usually smaller, either endogenous or in response to external circumstances or vigorous exertion, and either an increase or a drop.

The resting human body generates about two-thirds of its heat through metabolism in internal organs in the thorax and abdomen, as well as in the brain. The brain generates about 16% of the total heat produced by the body.

Heat loss is a major threat to smaller creatures, as they have a larger ratio of surface area to volume. Small warm-blooded animals have insulation in the form of fur or feathers. Aquatic warm-blooded animals, such as seals, generally have deep layers of blubber under the skin and any pelage (fur) that they might have; both contribute to their insulation. Penguins have both feathers and blubber. Penguin feathers are scale-like and serve both for insulation and streamlining. Endotherms that live in very cold circumstances or conditions predisposing to heat loss, such as polar waters, tend to have specialised structures of blood vessels in their extremities that act as heat exchangers. The veins are adjacent to the arteries full of warm blood. Some of the arterial heat is conducted to the cold blood and recycled back into the trunk. Birds, especially waders, often have very well-developed heat exchange mechanisms in their legs—those in the legs of emperor penguins are part of the adaptations that enable them to spend months on Antarctic winter ice. In response to cold, many warm-blooded animals also reduce blood flow to the skin by vasoconstriction to reduce heat loss. As a result, they blanch (become paler).

===Avoiding overheating===
In equatorial climates and during temperate summers, overheating (hyperthermia) is as great a threat as cold. In hot conditions, many warm-blooded animals increase heat loss by panting, which cools the animal by increasing water evaporation in the breath, and/or flushing, increasing the blood flow to the skin so the heat will radiate into the environment. Hairless and short-haired mammals, including humans and horses, also sweat, since the evaporation of the water in sweat removes heat. Elephants keep cool by using their huge ears like radiators in automobiles. Their ears are thin and the blood vessels are close to the skin, and flapping their ears to increase the airflow over them causes the blood to cool, which reduces their core body temperature when the blood moves through the rest of the circulatory system.

==Pros and cons of an endothermic metabolism==
The major advantage of endothermy over ectothermy is decreased vulnerability to fluctuations in external temperature. Regardless of location (and hence external temperature), endothermy maintains a constant core temperature for optimal enzyme activity.

Endotherms control body temperature by internal homeostatic mechanisms. In mammals, two separate homeostatic mechanisms are involved in thermoregulation—one mechanism increases body temperature, while the other decreases it. The presence of two separate mechanisms provides a very high degree of control. This is important because the core temperature of mammals can be controlled to be as close as possible to the optimal temperature for enzyme activity.

The overall rate of an animal&#x27;s metabolism increases by a factor of about two for every rise in temperature, limited by the need to avoid hyperthermia. Endothermy does not provide greater speed in movement than ectothermy (cold-bloodedness)—ectothermic animals can move as fast as warm-blooded animals of the same size and build when the ectotherm is near or at its optimal temperature, but often cannot maintain high metabolic activity for as long as endotherms. Endothermic/homeothermic animals can be optimally active at more times during the diurnal cycle in places of sharp temperature variations between day and night and during more of the year in places of great seasonal differences of temperature. This is accompanied by the need to expend more energy to maintain the constant internal temperature and a greater food requirement. Endothermy may be important during reproduction, for example, in expanding the thermal range over which a species can reproduce, as embryos are generally intolerant of thermal fluctuations that are easily tolerated by adults. Endothermy may also provide protection against fungal infection. While tens of thousands of fungal species infect insects, only a few hundred target mammals, and often only those with a compromised immune system. A recent study
suggests fungi are fundamentally ill-equipped to thrive at mammalian temperatures. The high temperatures afforded by endothermy might have provided an evolutionary advantage.

Ectotherms increase their body temperature mostly through external heat sources such as sunlight energy; therefore, they depend on environmental conditions to reach operational body temperatures. Endothermic animals mostly use internal heat production through metabolic active organs and tissues (liver, kidney, heart, brain, muscle) or specialized heat producing tissues like brown adipose tissue (BAT). In general, endotherms therefore have higher metabolic rates than ectotherms at a given body mass. As a consequence they also need higher food intake rates, which may limit abundance of endotherms more than ectotherms.

Because ectotherms depend on environmental conditions for body temperature regulation, they typically are more sluggish at night and in the morning when they emerge from their shelters to heat up in the first sunlight. Foraging activity is therefore restricted to the daytime (diurnal activity patterns) in most vertebrate ectotherms. In lizards, for instance, only a few species are known to be nocturnal (e.g. many geckos) and they mostly use &#x27;sit and wait&#x27; foraging strategies that may not require body temperatures as high as those necessary for active foraging. Endothermic vertebrate species are, therefore, less dependent on the environmental conditions and have developed a high variability (both within and between species) in their diurnal activity patterns.

It is thought that the evolution of endothermia was crucial in the development of eutherian mammalian species diversity in the Mesozoic period. Endothermia gave the early mammals the capacity to be active during nighttime while maintaining small body sizes. Adaptations in photoreception and the loss of UV protection characterizing modern eutherian mammals are understood as adaptations for an originally nocturnal lifestyle, suggesting that the group went through an evolutionary bottleneck (the nocturnal bottleneck hypothesis). This could have avoided predator pressure from diurnal reptiles and dinosaurs, although some predatory dinosaurs, being equally endothermic, might have adapted a nocturnal lifestyle in order to prey on those mammals.

==Facultative endothermy==
Many insect species are able to maintain a thoracic temperature above the ambient temperature using exercise. These are known as facultative or exercise endotherms. The honey bee, for example, does so by contracting antagonistic flight muscles without moving its wings (see insect thermoregulation). This form of thermogenesis is, however, only efficient above a certain temperature threshold, and below about , the honey bee reverts to ectothermy.

Facultative endothermy can also be seen in multiple snake species that use their metabolic heat to warm their eggs. &quot;Python molurus&quot; and &quot;Morelia spilota&quot; are two python species where females surround their eggs and shiver in order to incubate them.

== Regional endothermy ==
Some ectotherms, including several species of fish and reptiles, have been shown to make use of regional endothermy, where muscle activity causes certain parts of the body to remain at higher temperatures than the rest of the body. This allows for better locomotion and use of the senses in cold environments.

==Contrast between thermodynamic and biological terminology==
Students encounter a source of possible confusion between the terminology of physics and biology. Whereas the thermodynamic terms &quot;exothermic&quot; and &quot;endothermic&quot; respectively refer to processes that give out heat energy and processes that absorb heat energy, in biology the sense is effectively reversed. The metabolic terms &quot;ectotherm&quot; and &quot;endotherm&quot; respectively refer to organisms that rely largely on external heat to achieve a full working temperature, and to organisms that produce heat from within as a major factor in controlling their body temperatures.

<text>This is a list of [[Head of state|heads of state]] of [[Chad]] since the country gained independence from France in 1960 to the present day.

A total of six people have served as head of state of Chad (not counting two Interim Heads of State). Additionally, one person, Goukouni Oueddei, has served on two non-consecutive occasions.

The current head of state of Chad is Mahamat Déby, since 20 April 2021, when he took power in a military coup following the death of his father, President Idriss Déby. Mahamat Déby was President of the Transitional Military Council, a military junta, from 20 April 2021 until 10 October 2022, when he was sworn is as Transitional President of the Republic following a &quot;national dialogue&quot;. On 6 May 2024, Déby won the presidential election and was proclaimed President on 23 May.

==Term limits==
In 2018, the new Constitution of Chad reinstated two-term limits for the president. It also changed the length of the term from five years to six years. However, in 2023, a constitutional referendum was held which changed the length of the term from six years back to five years and which also lowered the minimum age for the presidency from 40 down to 35.

<doc id="378653" wikidata="Q28524" url="?curid=378653" title="Anthozoa">
<text>Anthozoa is a subphylum of marine invertebrates which includes sessile cnidarians such as the sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals and sea pens. Adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse as planktons. The basic unit of the adult is the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, but the majority of corals are colonial, being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate and other materials and take various massive, plate-like, bushy or leafy forms.

Members of Anthozoa possess cnidocytes, a feature shared among other cnidarians such as the jellyfish, box jellies and parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa. The two main subclasses of Anthozoa are the Hexacorallia, members of which have six-fold symmetry and includes the stony corals, sea anemones, tube anemones and zoanthids; and the Octocorallia, which have eight-fold symmetry and includes the soft corals and gorgonians (sea pens, sea fans and sea whips), and sea pansies. The smaller subclass, Ceriantharia, consists of the tube-dwelling anemones. Some additional species are also included as &quot;incertae sedis&quot; until their exact taxonomic position can be ascertained.

Anthozoans are carnivores, catching prey with their tentacles. Many species supplement their energy needs by making use of photosynthetic single-celled algae that live within their tissues. These species live in shallow water and many are reef-builders. Other species lack the zooxanthellae and, having no need for well-lit areas, typically live in deep-water locations.

Unlike other members of this phylum, anthozoans do not have a medusa stage in their development. Instead, they release sperm and eggs into the water. After fertilisation, the planula larvae form part of the plankton. When fully developed, the larvae settle on the seabed and attach to the substrate, undergoing metamorphosis into polyps. Some anthozoans can also reproduce asexually through budding or by breaking in pieces.

==Diversity==

The name &quot;Anthozoa&quot; comes from the Greek words (&#x27;; &quot;flower&quot;) and (&#x27;; &quot;animals&quot;), hence ανθόζωα (&quot;anthozoa&quot;) = &quot;flower animals&quot;, a reference to the floral appearance of their perennial polyp stage.

Anthozoans are exclusively marine, and include sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa is the largest taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They range in size from small individuals less than half a centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species with a wide range of colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.

==Phylogeny==

Anthozoa is subdivided into three subclasses: Octocorallia, Hexacorallia and Ceriantharia, which form monophyletic groups and generally show differentiating reflections on symmetry of polyp structure for each subclass. The relationships within the subclasses are unresolved.

Historically, the &quot;Ceriantipatharia&quot; was thought to be a separate subclass but, of the two orders it comprised, Antipatharia is now considered part of Hexacorallia and Ceriantharia is now considered an independent subclass. The extant orders are shown to the right.

Hexacorallia includes coral reef builders: the stony corals (Scleractinia), sea anemones (Actiniaria), and zoanthids (Zoantharia). Genetic studies of ribosomal DNA has shown Ceriantharia to be a monophyletic group and the oldest, or basal, order among them.

Classification according to the World Register of Marine Species:
* subclass Hexacorallia
** order Actiniaria — sea anemones
** order Antipatharia — black coral
** order Corallimorpharia — corallimorphs
** order Rugosa †
** order Scleractinia — stony corals
** order Zoantharia — zoanthids
* subclass Octocorallia
** order Alcyonacea — soft corals and gorgonians
** order Helioporacea — blue corals
** order Pennatulacea — pennatules, sea feathers, sea pens, sea pansies
* subclass Ceriantharia — ceriantharians, tube-dwelling anemones
** order Penicillaria
** order Spirularia
* Anthozoa &quot;incertae sedis&quot;
** genus &quot;Aiptasiodes&quot;
** order Auloporida †
** genus &quot;Sarcinula&quot; †

Octocorallia comprises the sea pens (Pennatulacea), soft corals (Alcyonacea), and blue coral (Helioporacea). Sea whips and sea fans, known as gorgonians, are part of Alcyonacea and historically were divided into separate orders.

Ceriantharia comprises the related tube-dwelling anemones. Tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids look very similar to sea anemones, but belong to an entirely different subclass of anthozoans. They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live and can withdraw into tubes, which are made of a fibrous material, which is made from secreted mucus and threads of nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.

==Anatomy==
The basic body form of an anthozoan is the polyp. This consists of a tubular column topped by a flattened area, the oral disc, with a central mouth; a whorl of tentacles surrounds the mouth. In solitary individuals, the base of the polyp is the foot or pedal disc, which adheres to the substrate, while in colonial polyps, the base links to other polyps in the colony.
The mouth leads into a tubular pharynx which descends for some distance into the body before opening into the coelenteron, otherwise known as the gastrovascular cavity, that occupies the interior of the body. Internal tensions pull the mouth into a slit-shape, and the ends of the slit lead into two grooves in the pharynx wall called siphonoglyphs. The coelenteron is subdivided by a number of vertical partitions, known as mesenteries or septa. Some of these extend from the body wall as far as the pharynx and are known as &quot;complete septa&quot; while others do not extend so far and are &quot;incomplete&quot;. The septa also attach to the oral and pedal discs.

The body wall consists of an epidermal layer, a jellylike mesogloea layer and an inner gastrodermis; the septa are infoldings of the body wall and consist of a layer of mesogloea sandwiched between two layers of gastrodermis. In some taxa, sphincter muscles in the mesogloea close over the oral disc and act to keep the polyp fully retracted. The tentacles contain extensions of the coelenteron and have sheets of longitudinal muscles in their walls. The oral disc has radial muscles in the epidermis, but most of the muscles in the column are gastrodermal, and include strong retractor muscles beside the septa. The number and arrangement of the septa, as well as the arrangement of these retractor muscles, are important in anthozoan classification.

The tentacles are armed with nematocysts, venom-containing cells which can be fired harpoon-fashion to snare and subdue prey. These need to be replaced after firing, a process that takes about forty-eight hours. Some sea anemones have a circle of acrorhagi outside the tentacles; these long projections are armed with nematocysts and act as weapons. Another form of weapon is the similarly armed acontia (threadlike defensive organs) which can be extruded through apertures in the column wall. Some stony corals employ nematocyst-laden &quot;sweeper tentacles&quot; as a defence against the intrusion of other individuals.

Many anthozoans are colonial and consist of multiple polyps with a common origin joined by living material. The simplest arrangement is where a stolon runs along the substrate in a two dimensional lattice with polyps budding off at intervals. Alternatively, polyps may bud off from a sheet of living tissue, the coenosarc, which joins the polyps and anchors the colony to the substrate. The coenosarc may consist of a thin membrane from which the polyps project, as in most stony corals, or a thick fleshy mass in which the polyps are immersed apart from their oral discs, as in the soft corals.

The skeleton of a stony coral in the order Scleractinia is secreted by the epidermis of the lower part of the polyp; this forms a corallite, a cup-shaped hollow made of calcium carbonate, in which the polyp sits. In colonial corals, following growth of the polyp by budding, new corallites are formed, with the surface of the skeleton being covered by a layer of coenosarc. These colonies adopt a range of massive, branching, leaf-like and encrusting forms. Soft corals in the subclass Octocorallia are also colonial and have a skeleton formed of mesogloeal tissue, often reinforced with calcareous spicules or horny material, and some have rod-like supports internally. Other anthozoans, such as sea anemones, are naked; these rely on a hydrostatic skeleton for support. Some of these species have a sticky epidermis to which sand grains and shell fragments adhere, and zoanthids incorporate these substances into their mesogloea.

==Biology==

Most anthozoans are opportunistic predators, catching prey which drifts within reach of their tentacles. The prey is secured with the help of sticky mucus, spirocysts (non-venomous harpoon cells) and nematocysts (venomous harpoon cells). The tentacles then bend to push larger prey into the mouth, while smaller, plankton-size prey, is moved by cilia to the tip of the tentacles which are then inserted into the mouth. The mouth can stretch to accommodate large items, and in some species, the lips may extend to help receive the prey. The pharynx then grasps the prey, which is mixed with mucus and slowly swallowed by peristalsis and ciliary action. When the food reaches the coelenteron, extracellular digestion is initiated by the discharge of the septa-based nematocysts and the release of enzymes. The partially digested food fragments are circulated in the coelenteron by cilia, and from here they are taken up by phagocytosis by the gastrodermal cells that line the cavity.

Most anthozoans supplement their predation by incorporating into their tissues certain unicellular, photosynthetic organisms known as zooxanthellae (or zoochlorellae in a few instances); many fulfil the bulk of their nutritional requirements in this way. In this symbiotic relationship, the zooxanthellae benefit by using nitrogenous waste and carbon dioxide produced by the host while the cnidarian gains photosynthetic capability and increased production of calcium carbonate, a substance of great importance to stony corals. The presence of zooxanthellae is not a permanent relationship. Under some circumstances, the symbionts can be expelled, and other species may later move in to take their place. The behaviour of the anthozoan can also be affected, with it choosing to settle in a well lit spot, and competing with its neighbours for light to allow photosynthesis to take place. Where an anthozoan lives in a cave or other dark location, the symbiont may be absent in a species that, in a sunlit location, normally benefits from one. Anthozoans living at depths greater than are azooxanthellate because there is insufficient light for photosynthesis.
With longitudinal, transverse and radial muscles, polyps are able to elongate and shorten, bend and twist, inflate and deflate, and extend and contract their tentacles. Most polyps extend to feed and contract when disturbed, often invaginating their oral discs and tentacles into the column. Contraction is achieved by pumping fluid out of the coelenteron, and reflation by drawing it in, a task performed by the siphonoglyphs in the pharynx which are lined with beating cilia. Most anthozoans adhere to the substrate with their pedal discs but some are able to detach themselves and move about, while others burrow into the sediment. Movement may be a passive drifting with the currents or in the case of sea anemones, may involve creeping along a surface on their base.

Gas exchange and excretion is accomplished by diffusion through the tentacles and internal and external body wall, aided by the movement of fluid being wafted along these surfaces by cilia. The sensory system consists of simple nerve nets in the gastrodermis and epidermis, but there are no specialised sense organs.

Anthozoans exhibit great powers of regeneration; lost parts swiftly regrow and the sea anemone &quot;Aiptasia pallida&quot; can be vivisected in the laboratory and then returned to the aquarium where it will heal. They are capable of a variety of asexual means of reproduction including fragmentation, longitudinal and transverse fission and budding. Sea anemones for example can crawl across a surface leaving behind them detached pieces of the pedal disc which develop into new clonal individuals. &quot;Anthopleura&quot; species divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and patterning. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in &quot;Anthopleura stellula&quot; and &quot;Gonactinia prolifera&quot;, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing on the column before the sea anemone tears itself apart. Zoanthids are capable of budding off new individuals.
Most anthozoans are unisexual but some stony corals are hermaphrodite. The germ cells originate in the endoderm and move to the gastrodermis where they differentiate. When mature, they are liberated into the coelenteron and thence to the open sea, with fertilisation being external. To make fertilisation more likely, corals emit vast numbers of gametes, and many species synchronise their release in relation to the time of day and the phase of the moon.

The zygote develops into a planula larva which swims by means of cilia and forms part of the plankton for a while before settling on the seabed and metamorphosing into a juvenile polyp. Some planulae contain yolky material and others incorporate zooxanthellae, and these adaptations enable these larvae to sustain themselves and disperse more widely. The planulae of the stony coral &quot;Pocillopora damicornis&quot;, for example, have lipid-rich yolks and remain viable for as long as 100 days before needing to settle.

==Ecology==
Coral reefs are some of the most biodiverse habitats on earth, supporting large numbers of species of corals, fish, molluscs, worms, arthropods, starfish, sea urchins, other invertebrates and algae. Because of the photosynthetic requirements of the corals, they are found in shallow waters, and many of these fringe land masses. With a three-dimensional structure, coral reefs are very productive ecosystems; they provide food for their inhabitants, hiding places of various sizes to suit many organisms, perching places, barriers to large predators and solid structures on which to grow. They are used as breeding grounds and as nurseries by many species of pelagic fish, and they influence the productivity of the ocean for miles around. Anthozoans prey on animals smaller than they are and are themselves eaten by such animals as fish, crabs, barnacles, snails and starfish. Their habitats are easily disturbed by outside factors which unbalance the ecosystem. In 1989, the invasive crown-of-thorns starfish (&quot;Acanthaster planci&quot;) caused havoc in American Samoa, killing 90% of the corals in the reefs.

Corals that grow on reefs are called hermatypic, with those growing elsewhere are known as ahermatypic. Most of the latter are azooxanthellate and live in both shallow and deep sea habitats. In the deep sea they share the ecosystem with soft corals, polychaete worms, other worms, crustaceans, molluscs and sponges. In the Atlantic Ocean, the cold-water coral &quot;Lophelia pertusa&quot; forms extensive deep-water reefs which support many other species.

Other fauna, such as hydrozoa, bryozoa and brittle stars, often dwell among the branches of gorgonian and coral colonies. The pygmy seahorse not only makes certain species of gorgonians its home, but closely resembles its host and is thus well camouflaged. Some organisms have an obligate relationship with their host species. The mollusc &quot;Simnialena marferula&quot; is only found on the sea whip &quot;Leptogorgia virgulata&quot;, is coloured like it and has sequestered its defensive chemicals, and the nudibranch &quot;Tritonia wellsi&quot; is another obligate symbiont, its feathery gills resembling the tentacles of the polyps.
A number of sea anemone species are commensal with other organisms. Certain crabs and hermit crabs seek out sea anemones and place them on their shells for protection, and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone&#x27;s tentacles, gaining protection by being in close proximity to the stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea anemone. Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug &quot;Aeolidia papillosa&quot; feeds on the aggregating anemone (&quot;Anthopleura elegantissima&quot;), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.

== Paleontology ==
Several extinct orders of corals from the Paleozoic era (~540–252 million years ago) are thought to be close to the ancestors of modern Scleractinia:

*Numidiaphyllida †
*Kilbuchophyllida †
*Heterocorallia †
*Rugosa †
*Heliolitida †
*Tabulata †
*Cothoniida †
*Tabuloconida †

These are all corals and correspond to the fossil record time line. With readily-preserved hard calcareous skeletons, they comprise the majority of Anthozoan fossils.

==Interactions with humans==

Coral reefs and shallow marine environments are threatened, not only by natural events and increased sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices. Pollution may be the result of run-off from the land of sewage, agricultural products, fuel or chemicals. These may directly kill or injure marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate reefs, and also affect the eggs and larva of marine life drifting near the surface.

Corals are collected for the aquarium trade, and this may be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In some parts of the world explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.

Deep water coral habitats are also threatened by human activities, particularly by indiscriminate trawling. These ecosystems have been little studied, but in the perpetual darkness and cold temperatures, animals grow and mature slowly and there are relatively fewer fish worth catching than in the sunlit waters above. To what extent deep-water coral reefs provide a safe nursery area for juvenile fish has not been established, but they may be important for many cold-water species.

<text>Thermoregulation is the ability of an organism to keep its body temperature within certain boundaries, even when the surrounding temperature is very different. A thermoconforming organism, by contrast, simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature, thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation. The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis: a state of dynamic stability in an organism&#x27;s internal conditions, maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment (the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology). If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as hyperthermia occurs. Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above for six hours.

Work in 2022 established by experiment that a wet-bulb temperature exceeding 30.55°C caused uncompensable heat stress in young, healthy adult humans. The opposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is known as hypothermia. It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction, causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it. Normal body temperature is around 37°C (98.6°F), and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than . Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures, hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range.

It was not until the introduction of thermometers that any exact data on the temperature of animals could be obtained. It was then found that local differences were present, since heat production and heat loss vary considerably in different parts of the body, although the circulation of the blood tends to bring about a mean temperature of the internal parts. Hence it is important to identify the parts of the body that most closely reflect the temperature of the internal organs. Also, for such results to be comparable, the measurements must be conducted under comparable conditions. The rectum has traditionally been considered to reflect most accurately the temperature of internal parts, or in some cases of sex or species, the vagina, uterus or bladder. Some animals undergo one of various forms of dormancy where the thermoregulation process temporarily allows the body temperature to drop, thereby conserving energy. Examples include hibernating bears and torpor in bats. 

==Classification of animals by thermal characteristics==
===Endothermy vs. ectothermy===
Thermoregulation in organisms runs along a spectrum from endothermy to ectothermy. Endotherms create most of their heat via metabolic processes and are colloquially referred to as warm-blooded. When the surrounding temperatures are cold, endotherms increase metabolic heat production to keep their body temperature constant, thus making the internal body temperature of an endotherm more or less independent of the temperature of the environment. Endotherms possess a larger number of mitochondria per cell than ectotherms, enabling them to generate more heat by increasing the rate at which they metabolize fats and sugars. Ectotherms use external sources of temperature to regulate their body temperatures. They are colloquially referred to as cold-blooded despite the fact that body temperatures often stay within the same temperature ranges as warm-blooded animals. Ectotherms are the opposite of endotherms when it comes to regulating internal temperatures. In ectotherms, the internal physiological sources of heat are of negligible importance; the biggest factor that enables them to maintain adequate body temperatures is due to environmental influences. Living in areas that maintain a constant temperature throughout the year, like the tropics or the ocean, has enabled ectotherms to develop behavioral mechanisms that respond to external temperatures, such as sun-bathing to increase body temperature, or seeking the cover of shade to lower body temperature.

===Ectotherms===


===Ectothermic cooling===
* Vaporization:
** Evaporation of sweat and other bodily fluids.
* Convection:
** Increasing blood flow to body surfaces to maximize heat transfer across the advective gradient.
* Conduction:
** Losing heat by being in contact with a colder surface. For instance:
*** Lying on cool ground.
*** Staying wet in a river, lake or sea.
*** Covering in cool mud.
* Radiation:
** Releasing heat by radiating it away from the body.

===Ectothermic heating (or minimizing heat loss)===

* Convection:
** Climbing to higher ground up trees, ridges, rocks.
** Entering a warm water or air current.
** Building an insulated nest or burrow.
* Conduction:
** Lying on a hot surface.
* Radiation:
** Lying in the sun (heating this way is affected by the body&#x27;s angle in relation to the sun).
** Folding skin to reduce exposure.
** Concealing wing surfaces.
** Exposing wing surfaces.
* Insulation:
** Changing shape to alter surface/volume ratio.
** Inflating the body.

To cope with low temperatures, some fish have developed the ability to remain functional even when the water temperature is below freezing; some use natural antifreeze or antifreeze proteins to resist ice crystal formation in their tissues. Amphibians and reptiles cope with heat gain by evaporative cooling and behavioral adaptations. An example of behavioral adaptation is that of a lizard lying in the sun on a hot rock in order to heat through radiation and conduction.

===Endothermy===
An endotherm is an animal that regulates its own body temperature, typically by keeping it at a constant level. To regulate body temperature, an organism may need to prevent heat gains in arid environments. Evaporation of water, either across respiratory surfaces or across the skin in those animals possessing sweat glands, helps in cooling body temperature to within the organism&#x27;s tolerance range. Animals with a body covered by fur have limited ability to sweat, relying heavily on panting to increase evaporation of water across the moist surfaces of the lungs and the tongue and mouth. Mammals like cats, dogs and pigs, rely on panting or other means for thermal regulation and have sweat glands only in foot pads and snout. The sweat produced on pads of paws and on palms and soles mostly serves to increase friction and enhance grip. Birds also counteract overheating by gular fluttering, or rapid vibrations of the gular (throat) skin. Down feathers trap warm air acting as excellent insulators just as hair in mammals acts as a good insulator. Mammalian skin is much thicker than that of birds and often has a continuous layer of insulating fat beneath the dermis. In marine mammals, such as whales, or animals that live in very cold regions, such as the polar bears, this is called blubber. Dense coats found in desert endotherms also aid in preventing heat gain such as in the case of the camels.

A cold weather strategy is to temporarily decrease metabolic rate, decreasing the temperature difference between the animal and the air and thereby minimizing heat loss. Furthermore, having a lower metabolic rate is less energetically expensive. Many animals survive cold frosty nights through torpor, a short-term temporary drop in body temperature. Organisms, when presented with the problem of regulating body temperature, have not only behavioural, physiological, and structural adaptations but also a feedback system to trigger these adaptations to regulate temperature accordingly. The main features of this system are &quot;stimulus, receptor, modulator, effector&quot; and then the feedback of the newly adjusted temperature to the &quot;stimulus.&quot; This cyclical process aids in homeostasis.

===Homeothermy compared with poikilothermy===
Homeothermy and poikilothermy refer to how stable an organism&#x27;s deep-body temperature is. Most endothermic organisms are homeothermic, like mammals. However, animals with facultative endothermy are often poikilothermic, meaning their temperature can vary considerably. Most fish are ectotherms, as most of their heat comes from the surrounding water. However, almost all fish are poikilothermic.

=== Beetles ===
The physiology of the Dendroctonus micans beetle encompasses a suite of adaptations crucial for its survival and reproduction. Flight capabilities enable them to disperse and locate new host trees, while sensory organs aid in detecting environmental cues and food sources. Of particular importance is their ability to thermoregulate, ensuring optimal body temperature in fluctuating forest conditions. This physiological mechanism, coupled with thermosensation, allows them to thrive across diverse environments. Overall, these adaptations underscore the beetle&#x27;s remarkable resilience and highlight the significance of understanding their physiology for effective management and conservation efforts.

==Vertebrates==
By numerous observations upon humans and other animals, John Hunter showed that the essential difference between the so-called warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals lies in observed constancy of the temperature of the former, and the observed variability of the temperature of the latter. Almost all birds and mammals have a high temperature almost constant and independent of that of the surrounding air (homeothermy). Almost all other animals display a variation of body temperature, dependent on their surroundings (poikilothermy).

===Brain control===
Thermoregulation in both ectotherms and endotherms is controlled mainly by the preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus. Such homeostatic control is separate from the sensation of temperature.

===In birds and mammals===

In cold environments, birds and mammals employ the following adaptations and strategies to minimize heat loss:
# Using small smooth muscles (arrector pili in mammals), which are attached to feather or hair shafts; this distorts the surface of the skin making feather/hair shaft stand erect (called goose bumps or goose pimples) which slows the movement of air across the skin and minimizes heat loss.
# Increasing body size to more easily maintain core body temperature (warm-blooded animals in cold climates tend to be larger than similar species in warmer climates (see Bergmann&#x27;s rule))
# Having the ability to store energy as fat for metabolism
# Have shortened extremities
# Have countercurrent blood flow in extremities – this is where the warm arterial blood travelling to the limb passes the cooler venous blood from the limb and heat is exchanged warming the venous blood and cooling the arterial (e.g., Arctic wolf or penguins)
In warm environments, birds and mammals employ the following adaptations and strategies to maximize heat loss:
# Behavioural adaptations like living in burrows during the day and being nocturnal
# Evaporative cooling by perspiration and panting
# Storing fat reserves in one place (e.g., camel&#x27;s hump) to avoid its insulating effect
# Elongated, often vascularized extremities to conduct body heat to the air

In humans

As in other mammals, thermoregulation is an important aspect of human homeostasis. Most body heat is generated in the deep organs, especially the liver, brain, and heart, and in contraction of skeletal muscles. Humans have been able to adapt to a great diversity of climates, including hot humid and hot arid. High temperatures pose serious stresses for the human body, placing it in great danger of injury or even death. For example, one of the most common reactions to hot temperatures is heat exhaustion, which is an illness that could happen if one is exposed to high temperatures, resulting in some symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, or a rapid heartbeat. For humans, adaptation to varying climatic conditions includes both physiological mechanisms resulting from evolution and behavioural mechanisms resulting from conscious cultural adaptations. The physiological control of the body&#x27;s core temperature takes place primarily through the hypothalamus, which assumes the role as the body&#x27;s &quot;thermostat&quot;. This organ possesses control mechanisms as well as key temperature sensors, which are connected to nerve cells called thermoreceptors. Thermoreceptors come in two subcategories; ones that respond to cold temperatures and ones that respond to warm temperatures. Scattered throughout the body in both peripheral and central nervous systems, these nerve cells are sensitive to changes in temperature and are able to provide useful information to the hypothalamus through the process of negative feedback, thus maintaining a constant core temperature.
There are four avenues of heat loss: evaporation, convection, conduction, and radiation. If skin temperature is greater than that of the surrounding air temperature, the body can lose heat by convection and conduction. However, if air temperature of the surroundings is greater than that of the skin, the body &quot;gains&quot; heat by convection and conduction. In such conditions, the only means by which the body can rid itself of heat is by evaporation. So, when the surrounding temperature is higher than the skin temperature, anything that prevents adequate evaporation will cause the internal body temperature to rise. During intense physical activity (e.g. sports), evaporation becomes the main avenue of heat loss. Humidity affects thermoregulation by limiting sweat evaporation and thus heat loss.

=== In reptiles ===
Thermoregulation is also an integral part of a reptile&#x27;s life, specifically lizards such as &quot;Microlophus occipitalis&quot; and &quot;Ctenophorus decresii&quot; who must change microhabitats to keep a constant body temperature. By moving to cooler areas when it is too hot and to warmer areas when it is cold, they can thermoregulate their temperature to stay within their necessary bounds.

==In plants==
Thermogenesis occurs in the flowers of many plants in the family Araceae as well as in cycad cones. In addition, the sacred lotus (&quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;) is able to thermoregulate itself, remaining on average above air temperature while flowering. Heat is produced by breaking down the starch that was stored in their roots, which requires the consumption of oxygen at a rate approaching that of a flying hummingbird.

One possible explanation for plant thermoregulation is to provide protection against cold temperature. For example, the skunk cabbage is not frost-resistant, yet it begins to grow and flower when there is still snow on the ground. Another theory is that thermogenicity helps attract pollinators, which is borne out by observations that heat production is accompanied by the arrival of beetles or flies.

Some plants are known to protect themselves against colder temperatures using antifreeze proteins. This occurs in wheat (&quot;Triticum aestivum),&quot; potatoes (&quot;Solanum tuberosum&quot;) and several other angiosperm species.

==Behavioral temperature regulation==
Animals other than humans regulate and maintain their body temperature with physiological adjustments and behavior. Desert lizards are ectotherms, and therefore are unable to regulate their internal temperature themselves. To regulate their internal temperature, many lizards relocate themselves to a more environmentally favorable location. They may do this in the morning only by raising their head from its burrow and then exposing their entire body. By basking in the sun, the lizard absorbs solar heat. It may also absorb heat by conduction from heated rocks that have stored radiant solar energy. To lower their temperature, lizards exhibit varied behaviors. Sand seas, or ergs, produce up to , and the sand lizard will hold its feet up in the air to cool down, seek cooler objects with which to contact, find shade, or return to its burrow. They also go to their burrows to avoid cooling when the temperature falls. Aquatic animals can also regulate their temperature behaviorally by changing their position in the thermal gradient. Sprawling prone in a cool shady spot, &quot;splooting,&quot; has been observed in squirrels on hot days.
Animals also engage in kleptothermy in which they share or steal each other&#x27;s body warmth. Kleptothermy is observed, particularly amongst juveniles, in endotherms such as bats and birds (such as the mousebird and emperor penguin). This allows the individuals to increase their thermal inertia (as with gigantothermy) and so reduce heat loss. Some ectotherms share burrows of ectotherms. Other animals exploit termite mounds.

Some animals living in cold environments maintain their body temperature by preventing heat loss. Their fur grows more densely to increase the amount of insulation. Some animals are regionally heterothermic and are able to allow their less insulated extremities to cool to temperatures much lower than their core temperature—nearly to . This minimizes heat loss through less insulated body parts, like the legs, feet (or hooves), and nose.

Different species of &quot;Drosophila&quot; found in the Sonoran Desert will exploit different species of cacti based on the thermotolerance differences between species and hosts. For example, &quot;Drosophila mettleri&quot; is found in cacti like the saguaro and senita; these two cacti remain cool by storing water. Over time, the genes selecting for higher heat tolerance were reduced in the population due to the cooler host climate the fly is able to exploit.

Some flies, such as &quot;Lucilia sericata,&quot; lay their eggs en masse. The resulting group of larvae, depending on its size, is able to thermoregulate and keep itself at the optimum temperature for development.
Koalas also can behaviorally thermoregulate by seeking out cooler portions of trees on hot days. They preferentially wrap themselves around the coolest portions of trees, typically near the bottom, to increase their passive radiation of internal body heat.

===Hibernation, estivation and daily torpor===
To cope with limited food resources and low temperatures, some mammals hibernate during cold periods. To remain in &quot;stasis&quot; for long periods, these animals build up brown fat reserves and slow all body functions. True hibernators (e.g., groundhogs) keep their body temperatures low throughout hibernation whereas the core temperature of false hibernators (e.g., bears) varies; occasionally the animal may emerge from its den for brief periods. Some bats are true hibernators and rely upon a rapid, non-shivering thermogenesis of their brown fat deposit to bring them out of hibernation.

Estivation is similar to hibernation, however, it usually occurs in hot periods to allow animals to avoid high temperatures and desiccation. Both terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate and vertebrates enter into estivation. Examples include lady beetles (&quot;Coccinellidae&quot;), North American desert tortoises, crocodiles, salamanders, cane toads, and the water-holding frog.

Daily torpor occurs in small endotherms like bats and hummingbirds, which temporarily reduces their high metabolic rates to conserve energy.

== Variation in animals ==
===Normal human temperature===

Previously, average oral temperature for healthy adults had been considered , while normal ranges are . In Poland and Russia, the temperature had been measured axillarily (under the arm). was considered &quot;ideal&quot; temperature in these countries, while normal ranges are .

Recent studies suggest that the average temperature for healthy adults is (same result in three different studies). Variations (one standard deviation) from three other studies are:
* for males, for females

Measured temperature varies according to thermometer placement, with rectal temperature being higher than oral temperature, while axillary temperature is lower than oral temperature. The average difference between oral and axillary temperatures of Indian children aged 6–12 was found to be only 0.1 °C (standard deviation 0.2 °C), and the mean difference in Maltese children aged 4–14 between oral and axillary temperature was 0.56 °C, while the mean difference between rectal and axillary temperature for children under 4 years old was 0.38 °C.

===Variations due to circadian rhythms===
In humans, a diurnal variation has been observed dependent on the periods of rest and activity, lowest at 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. and peaking at 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monkeys also have a well-marked and regular diurnal variation of body temperature that follows periods of rest and activity, and is not dependent on the incidence of day and night; nocturnal monkeys reach their highest body temperature at night and lowest during the day. Sutherland Simpson and J.J. Galbraith observed that all nocturnal animals and birds – whose periods of rest and activity are naturally reversed through habit and not from outside interference – experience their highest temperature during the natural period of activity (night) and lowest during the period of rest (day). Those diurnal temperatures can be reversed by reversing their daily routine.

In essence, the temperature curve of diurnal birds is similar to that of humans and other homeothermic animals, except that the maximum occurs earlier in the afternoon and the minimum earlier in the morning. Also, the curves obtained from rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs were quite similar to those from humans. These observations indicate that body temperature is partially regulated by circadian rhythms.

===Variations due to human menstrual cycles===
During the follicular phase (which lasts from the first day of menstruation until the day of ovulation), the average basal body temperature in women ranges from . Within 24 hours of ovulation, women experience an elevation of due to the increased metabolic rate caused by sharply elevated levels of progesterone. The basal body temperature ranges between throughout the luteal phase, and drops down to pre-ovulatory levels within a few days of menstruation. Women can chart this phenomenon to determine whether and when they are ovulating, so as to aid conception or contraception.

===Variations due to fever===
Fever is a regulated elevation of the set point of core temperature in the hypothalamus, caused by circulating pyrogens produced by the immune system. To the subject, a rise in core temperature due to fever may result in feeling cold in an environment where people without fever do not.

===Variations due to biofeedback===
Some monks are known to practice Tummo, biofeedback meditation techniques, that allow them to raise their body temperatures substantially.

== Effect on lifespan ==
The effects of such a genetic change in body temperature on longevity is difficult to study in humans.

== Limits compatible with life ==
There are limits both of heat and cold that an endothermic animal can bear and other far wider limits that an ectothermic animal may endure and yet live. The effect of too extreme a cold is to decrease metabolism, and hence to lessen the production of heat. Both catabolic and anabolic pathways share in this metabolic depression, and, though less energy is used up, still less energy is generated. The effects of this diminished metabolism become telling on the central nervous system first, especially the brain and those parts concerning consciousness; both heart rate and respiration rate decrease; judgment becomes impaired as drowsiness supervenes, becoming steadily deeper until the individual loses consciousness; without medical intervention, death by hypothermia quickly follows. Occasionally, however, convulsions may set in towards the end, and death is caused by asphyxia.

In experiments on cats performed by Sutherland Simpson and Percy T. Herring, the animals were unable to survive when rectal temperature fell below . At this low temperature, respiration became increasingly feeble; heart-impulse usually continued after respiration had ceased, the beats becoming very irregular, appearing to cease, then beginning again. Death appeared to be mainly due to asphyxia, and the only certain sign that it had taken place was the loss of knee-jerks.

However, too high a temperature speeds up the metabolism of different tissues to such a rate that their metabolic capital is soon exhausted. Blood that is too warm produces dyspnea by exhausting the metabolic capital of the respiratory centre; heart rate is increased; the beats then become arrhythmic and eventually cease. The central nervous system is also profoundly affected by hyperthermia and delirium, and convulsions may set in. Consciousness may also be lost, propelling the person into a comatose condition. These changes can sometimes also be observed in patients experiencing an acute fever. Mammalian muscle becomes rigid with heat rigor at about 50 °C, with the sudden rigidity of the whole body rendering life impossible.

H.M. Vernon performed work on the death temperature and paralysis temperature (temperature of heat rigor) of various animals. He found that species of the same class showed very similar temperature values, those from the Amphibia examined being 38.5 °C, fish 39 °C, reptiles 45 °C, and various molluscs 46 °C. Also, in the case of pelagic animals, he showed a relation between death temperature and the quantity of solid constituents of the body. In higher animals, however, his experiments tend to show that there is greater variation in both the chemical and physical characteristics of the protoplasm and, hence, greater variation in the extreme temperature compatible with life.

A 2022 study on the effect of heat on young people found that the critical wet-bulb temperature at which heat stress can no longer be compensated, Twb,crit, in young, healthy adults performing tasks at modest metabolic rates mimicking basic activities of daily life was much lower than the 35°C usually assumed, at about 30.55°C in 36–40°C humid environments, but progressively decreased in hotter, dry ambient environments.

===Arthropoda===

The maximum temperatures tolerated by certain thermophilic arthropods exceeds the lethal temperatures for most vertebrates.

The most heat-resistant insects are three genera of desert ants recorded from three different parts of the world. The ants have developed a lifestyle of scavenging for short durations during the hottest hours of the day, in excess of , for the carcasses of insects and other forms of life which have died from heat stress.

In April 2014, the South Californian mite &quot;Paratarsotomus macropalpis&quot; has been recorded as the world&#x27;s fastest land animal relative to body length, at a speed of 322 body lengths per second. Besides the unusually great speed of the mites, the researchers were surprised to find the mites running at such speeds on concrete at temperatures up to , which is significant because this temperature is well above the lethal limit for the majority of animal species. In addition, the mites are able to stop and change direction very quickly.

Spiders like &quot;Nephila pilipes&quot; exhibits active thermal regulation behavior. During high temperature sunny days, it aligns its body with the direction of sunlight to reduce the body area under direct sunlight.

<text>Star World, currently stylized logo-wise in capital letters and formerly known as Star Plus, is an Asian English language entertainment television channel originally launched on 15 December 1991 by Star TV in Hong Kong as the old iteration of Star Plus. Originally available in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong, as well as India and South Asia, since 2024 it is only available in the Middle East and North Africa after the closure of the Indian and Taiwanese feeds.

On 30 March 1996, the channel was split into two, when the former became Star World in East and Southeast Asia part of STAR TV&#x27;s rebranding, and the latter retained the Star Plus name in India and the Middle East. However, after Star (subsequently acquired by News Corporation) ended its partnership with Zee TV on 30 June 2000, Star Plus was transformed into a Hindi-language channel on 1 July 2000, with Star World being already introduced in the region as an English entertainment replacement.

The channel&#x27;s programming line-up mostly consists of entertainment television programmes from the United States, the United Kingdom and sometimes Australia and New Zealand to appeal to English-speaking locals.

==History==
Star World was first launched on 15 December 1991, showcasing international content from the United States, United Kingdom and Australia.

On 31 March 1996, STAR TV split Star Plus&#x27; beam into two, providing two separate services for different regional audiences within STAR TV&#x27;s footprint. This enabled the channel to provide appropriate programming and viewing time for viewers from different Asian regions. Star Plus would serve viewers in India and the Middle East from then on, while the new Star World channel welcomed those in East and Southeast Asia. Star TV converted Star Plus into Hindi entertainment channel with some English content programming. Earlier, STAR TV had a joint venture with Zee Telefilms, uplinking Hindi channel Zee TV from Hong Kong. But that partnership with that channel ended on 30 June 2000, resulted from the new Star World channel as an English entertainment replacement on 1 July 2000 for India and the Middle East.

On 1 April 1999, Star World, Star Movies, Star Sports, Star Gold, Star Plus, and SCM would receive their first major logo change as part of STAR TV&#x27;s brand refresh.

On 1 October 2017, the Hong Kong and Southeast Asian version of Star World was rebranded to Fox Life, and shut down after exactly four years, on 1 October 2021. 

On 1 February 2020, the Taiwanese feed closed and some programs were moved to Fox. On 1 January 2022, Star World replaced the Taiwanese feed of Fox, marking the return of the Star World brand in Taiwan. Disney, which had previously brought FOX International Networks, decided to launch Disney+ in more Asian markets, and decided to discontinue pay TV broadcasting, including Star World in Taiwan. The channel ceased for the second time on 1 January 2024.

On 15 March 2023, the Indian version of Star World in both SD and HD feeds, as well as Star World Premiere HD, ceased broadcasting along with the launches and shutdowns of several other channels from Disney Star. As a result, Star World remains on air only in the Middle East and North Africa.

On 1 March 2024, Star World MENA underwent a rebranding and introduced a new logo and graphics package, along with five other Disney-operated channels in the region, many of which abandoned the Fox brand; moreover, its sister channel Star Movies shed its 2009 logo (still used in India and mainland China) and introduced a new logo.

==Current channel==
* Star World Middle East &amp; North Africa - broadcast times KSA, UAE; including Channel [V] programs

==Former channels==

The channel ceased operations on 15 March 2023. It used the same logo from 2008 until its closure, never adopting the logo introduced in other regions in 2010 and 2013.
* Star World HD India - same as the India feed except for the logo and commercial feed; launched on 15 April 2011; only available in India and Nepal. The channel ceased operations on 15 March 2023.

<text>Mechanical toys are toys powered by mechanical energy. Depending on the mechanism used they can perform a range of motions, from simple to very complex.

==Types==
The types of mechanical energy used to power mechanical toys include rubber bands, springs, and flywheels.

Mechanical toys use 4 types of different movements, rotary (going around in a circle), linear (moving in a straight line then stopping), reciprocating (moving backwards and forwards continuously in a straight line) and oscillating (moving backwards and forwards in a curve).

Mechanical toys use several types of mechanisms, because Cam toys are powered by a very large cam and even bigger cam follower which transfers the cam rotation to the working area of the toy. The cam is &quot;unevenly&quot; rotated by placing the rotator out of the ideal center. This transforms the circular motion into motion that moves up and powers the toy.

Crank toys are internally based on cams too but allow more complicated motions. Single rotation of the crank leads to single action in the working area of the toy, and moving the crank forward and backward can result in reversed motion.

Some toys have cameras in them which makes them very expensive.

Gear toys use gear wheels to transfer the power in the toy, to change the speed and direction of motion. They can be powered by hand (with a cram or cam and cam follower) or by &quot;wind-up mechanism&quot;. The different number of teeth in the gear wheels determine the speed transition from wheel to wheel. By chaining and distributing number of gear wheels this type of mechanical toys allows very complex motions.

Lever toys are mechanical toys that use the mechanical advantage of a lever to transmit and transform movement. Lever toys can use cranks and cams too.

Pulley toys. Pulleys are very similar to gear wheels but two elements are connected by a metal chain or belt from elastic strong material (for example rubber.) Pulleys allow transferring power on distance much easier and with less losses that using number of gear wheels. Using pulleys in mechanical toys also allows to change the angle, the speed and the direction of the motion.

Wind-up toys typically are powered by a metal spring that is tightened by turning it. Then gear wheels and pulleys can transfer the power and control the toy motion.

==History==
One of the first mechanical toys is the flying pigeon by Archytas of Tarentum created 400-350 BC.
In 16th Century Leonardo da Vinci created his mechanical lion as a present for Louis XII. The lion could walk and reveal a cluster of lilies from his chest.
In 1738 Jacques de Vaucanson created a mechanical robot duck that was able to drink and eat.
Pierre Jaquet-Droz created &quot;The Writer, The Draftsman and The Musician&quot; - toys that are still present in the museum of Art and History in Switzerland.

==In education==
The potential educational value of mechanical toys in teaching transversal skills has been recognised by the European Union education project &quot;Clockwork objects, enhanced learning: Automata Toys Construction&quot; (CLOHE).
Also they play a valid part in teaching young children motor skills and are used in some schools to do this 
Mechanical toys were the subject of the Academy Award-winning 1972 short Dutch documentary, &quot;This Tiny World&quot;.

<text>Chiang Hsiao-yen (; born 1 March 1942) or John Chiang, formerly surnamed Chang (), is a Taiwanese politician affiliated with the Kuomintang. He is the speculated illegitimate son of Chiang Ching-kuo, former leader of the Republic of China, which would make him the grandson of Chiang Kai-shek.

== Early life and education ==
He and his identical twin brother, Winston Chang, both illegitimate, are believed to have been born the sons of Chiang Ching-kuo and his mistress Chang Ya-juo at the Second People&#x27;s Hospital of Guilian, a public hospital in Guilin. Since they were born out of wedlock, the twins took their mother&#x27;s surname, Chang, though they were given the Chiang generation name () shared by all the grandchildren of Chiang Kai-shek, including Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s legitimate children.

Chang Ya-juo died when the brothers were one year old in August 1942, and they were raised by Chang Ya-juo&#x27;s younger brother, Chang Hau-juo (章浩若) and his wife Chi Chen (紀琛). Their uncle and aunt were listed as their natural parents on official documents until December 2002, when the true parents were listed. Chou Chin-hua (周錦華), the boys&#x27; maternal grandmother, and the 7-year-old brothers moved to Taiwan amid the Chinese Civil War. They were not informed that Chiang Ching-kuo was their father until they were in high school. The Chang brothers went to Soochow University at the same time. John later obtained an M.S. from Georgetown University.

With Helen H. Huang (黃美倫), he has two daughters, Hui-lan (惠蘭) and Hui-yun (惠筠), and a son, Wan-an (萬安). In March 2005, he officially changed his surname to &quot;Chiang&quot;, saying, &quot;The change represents a respect for history, a return to the facts, and a realization of my parents&#x27; wishes.&quot; He also announced that his children would follow suit.

== Political career ==
Chiang began his career in the foreign service, serving in the ROC embassy in Washington, D.C., from 1974 to 1977. In the 1980s, he held various administrative posts in the ROC Foreign Ministry specializing in North American Affairs. He was Administrative Vice Minister from 1986 to 1990, Director General, of the Overseas Affairs Department in 1990, and Political Vice Minister from 1990 to 1993. In 1993 he was appointed to the cabinet-level post of Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and served as a member of the KMT Central Standing Committee. He was selected a member of the National Assembly in 1996.

He was Foreign Minister from 1996 to 1997, vice premier in 1997, and Secretary-General of the presidential office in 1999. He was speculated as a potential running mate for Lien Chan on the KMT ticket in the 2000 presidential elections until a sex scandal involving a mistress caused him to resign on 22 December 1999. His alleged mistress strenuously denied the allegations, filing suit against the newspaper which had named her.

Chang announced his candidacy for the December 2001 legislative elections in March 2001. One of his opponents in the December 2001 elections was his alleged 1999 mistress, but she received only a fraction of his eventual winning vote count. From 2002 through 2012, he was a member of the Legislative Yuan, first representing the constituency of Taipei City South from 2002 to 2005 and then representing Taipei City North from 2005 through 2012. He served as the Chairman of Interior Affairs Committee while in the legislature.

In January 2006, Chiang declared his candidacy as a KMT candidate for the Taipei Mayor, but withdrew from the race in April, stating he did so for party solidarity.

At the end of March 2007, Chiang staged a rally at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in support of his grandfather, late President Chiang Kai-shek. The Memorial hall was later renamed, in a hotly controversial move, by the Executive Yuan, to the National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall, striking out the name of Chiang Kai-shek temporarily; the Memorial&#x27;s name was restored on 21 August 2008.

In the 2008 Republic of China legislative election, John Chiang won re-election in his district of Taipei City North.

In April 2011, Chiang lost a poll for the Kuomintang legislative candidacy to Lo Shu-lei, a fellow Kuomintang legislator, in the Taipei Zhongshan-Songshan electoral district by a margin of 0.58 percent. The poll was made binding for the KMT nomination and Lo Shu-lei was later elected to the Legislative Yuan.

In March 2015, Chiang&#x27;s son Wan-an announced his candidacy for the Legislative Yuan in the KMT primary for Taipei&#x27;s Zhongshan-Songshan district, which put him against Lo Shu-lei and Wang Hung-wei for the KMT nomination. Chiang Wan-an subsequently won the KMT primary in May 2015, quickly gaining name recognition thanks in part to his chats with prospective voters as they waited for garbage trucks. John Chiang&#x27;s participation in his son&#x27;s campaign was limited to moral support and babysitting his son&#x27;s children.

<doc id="378672" wikidata="Q1159539" url="?curid=378672" title="Dangdut">
<text>Dangdut () is a genre of Indonesian folk music that is partly derived and fused from Hindustani, Arabic, and, to a lesser extent, Javanese, Malay, Minangkabau, Sundanese and local folk music. Dangdut is the most popular musical genre in Indonesia and very popular in other Maritime Southeast Asian countries because of its melodious instrumentation and vocals. Dangdut features a tabla and gendang beat.

Several popular dangdut singers include Rhoma Irama, Mansyur S., Elvy Sukaesih, Camelia Malik and now Iyeth Bustami, Ayu Ting Ting, Lesti Kejora and Via Vallen as Indonesian dangdut divas. Their music includes strong Indian music influences as the basis of harmony, theme, and beat. A dangdut musical group typically consists of a lead singer, backed by four to eight musicians. Instruments usually include a tabla, gendang, flute, mandolin, guitars, sitar, drum machines, and synthesisers. Modern dangdut incorporates influences from Middle Eastern pop music, Western rock, reggae, disco, contemporary R&amp;B, hip-hop, house, and electronic dance music.

The popularity of dangdut peaked in the 1970s and 1980s but emerged in the late 1960s. By 2012, it was still largely popular in Western Indonesia, but the genre was becoming less popular in the eastern parts, apart from Maluku. Meanwhile, more regional and faster-paced forms of dangdut (as opposed to slower, Bollywood-influenced dangdut) have risen in popularity.

== Development ==
The term &quot;dangdut&quot; is an onomatopoeia for the sound of the &quot;tabla&quot; (also known as &quot;gendang&quot;) drum, which is written &quot;dang&quot; and &quot;ndut&quot;. Putu Wijaya initially mentioned in the 27 May 1972 edition of &quot;Tempo&quot; magazine that the doll song from India was a mixture of Malay songs, desert rhythms, and Indian &quot;dang-ding-dut&quot;. It was reportedly coined by the music magazine &quot;Aktuil&quot;, although Rhoma Irama stated that it was coined as a term of derision by the rich upper class to the music of the poor. Despite its derogatory intent, it was seized upon by those playing it, and the term appears in Rhoma&#x27;s 1973 dangdut classic.

&quot;Dangdut&quot;, as a term, branched from a collective sound tradition of the &quot;Orkes Melayu&quot; (&quot;Malay orchestra&quot;) brought by &quot;bangsawan&quot; performers of Riau to Medan, Jakarta and Surabaya from the 1930s; its genesis can be pointed to heavy incorporation of music from Bollywood films among &quot;orkes&quot; bands in Jakarta in the 1950s – the films had huge the popularity following Sukarno&#x27;s embargo on Western music and film during this time. Modern Minangkabau music is also the forerunner of dangdut, along with Malay music.

Orkes Melayu singer Ellya Khadam switched to dangdut in the 1970s, and by 1972, she was the number-one artist in Indonesia. Her success, along with that of Rhoma Irama, meant that by 1975, 75 per cent of all recorded music in Indonesia was of the dangdut genre, with pop bands such as Koes Plus adopting the style.

== Culture and controversy ==
Dangdut has become &quot;contemporary folk music&quot; in Indonesia. Its popularity surpasses those of other music genres: people love to sing its songs with karaoke, both for themselves and during family celebrations, employees in central government offices exercise to its music before starting work, and so on. Political party campaign stages also do not miss out on utilising the popularity of dangdut to attract the masses.

Most major cities, especially on Java, have one or more venues with a dangdut show several times a week. Concerts of major dangdut stars are also broadcast on television. Because of the genre&#x27;s popularity, some movies and TV shows have dangdut-centered themes, such as Rhoma Irama&#x27;s movies and Rudy Soedjarwo&#x27;s &quot;Mendadak Dangdut&quot;.

As scholars note, dangdut is the most controversial genre regarding its relation to Indonesian Islamic morality, and few popular music genres around the world are more focused on women&#x27;s bodies than dangdut, whose lyrics often portray women as sexual objects.

On the one side, within dangdut, a religious current (spiritual dangdut) emerged. While most dangdut songs tell about relationships with boy(girl)friends, spiritual works are directed to God. The main contribution to the emergence of spiritual dangdut was made by Rhoma Irama (albums &quot;Hak Azazi&quot;, &quot;Judi&quot;, &quot;Takbir Lebaran&quot;, &quot;Haji&quot;, &quot;Haram&quot;, &quot;Baca&quot;, and &quot;Shalawat Nabi&quot;), who made dangdut as a tool for his preaching, which can be seen from the lyrics of the songs he created and from the statements he issued himself.

On the other side, beginning in 2003, certain dangdut musicians became the focus of a national controversy in Indonesia regarding performances by koplo dangdut singer Inul Daratista, which religious conservatives described as erotic and sexually suggestive. Protests led by dangdut megastar and devout Muslim Rhoma Irama called for Daratista to be banned from television, and legislation was passed in 2008 by the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly that introduced a broad range of activities described as pornography.

The flamboyant performances at some dangdut shows also attracted collateral attention in May 2012 when a row broke out in Indonesia over a planned performance by international star Lady Gaga in Jakarta due to be held in early June 2012. In the face of opposition from conservative Muslim groups in Indonesia, the planned show was cancelled. This cancellation led numerous commentators to note that opposition to Lady Gaga&#x27;s performances was surprising given the nature of some dangdut shows.

Dangdut remains an integral part of Indonesian life and pop culture despite conservative Muslim concerns over the supposed vulgarity of some performances (such as by Dewi Persik and Julia Perez).

Due to national laws, dangdut performers seek a balance of perceived womanhood, sexuality, and morality.

<text>Luigi Nono (; 29 January 1924 – 8 May 1990) was an Italian avant-garde composer of classical music.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Nono, born in Venice, was a member of a wealthy artistic family; his grandfather was a notable painter. Nono began music lessons with Gian Francesco Malipiero at the Venice Conservatory in 1941, where he acquired knowledge of the Renaissance madrigal tradition, amongst other styles. After graduating with a degree in law from the University of Padua, he was given encouragement in composition by Bruno Maderna. Through Maderna, he became acquainted with Hermann Scherchen—then Maderna&#x27;s conducting teacher—who gave Nono further tutelage and was an early mentor and advocate of his music.

Scherchen presented Nono&#x27;s first acknowledged work, the &quot;Variazioni canoniche sulla serie dell&#x27;op. 41 di A. Schönberg&quot; in 1950, at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse. The &quot;Variazioni canoniche&quot;, based on the twelve-tone series of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s Op. 41, including the &quot;Ode-to-Napoleon&quot; hexachord, marked Nono as a committed composer of anti-fascist political orientation. (&quot;Variazioni canoniche&quot; also used a six-element row of rhythmic values.) Nono had been a member of the Italian Resistance during the Second World War. His political commitment, while allying him with some of his contemporaries at Darmstadt such as Henri Pousseur and in the earlier days Hans Werner Henze, distinguished him from others, including Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Nevertheless, it was with Boulez and Stockhausen that Nono became one of the leaders of the New Music during the 1950s.

===1950s and the Darmstadt School===

A number of Nono&#x27;s early works were first performed at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse including &quot;Tre epitaffi per Federico García Lorca&quot; (1951–53), &quot;La Victoire de Guernica&quot; (1954)—intended, like Picasso&#x27;s painting, as an indictment of the wartime atrocity—and &quot;Incontri&quot; (1955). The &quot;Liebeslied&quot; (1954) was written for Nono&#x27;s wife-to-be, Nuria Schoenberg (daughter of Arnold Schoenberg), whom he met at the 1953 world première of &quot;Moses und Aron&quot; in Hamburg. They married in 1955. An atheist, Nono had enrolled as a member of the Italian Communist Party in 1952.

The world première of &quot;Il canto sospeso&quot; (1955–56) for solo voices, chorus, and orchestra brought Nono international recognition and acknowledgment as a successor to Webern. &quot;Reviewers noted with amazement that Nono&#x27;s &quot;canto sospeso&quot; achieved a synthesis—to a degree hardly thought possible—between an uncompromisingly avant-garde style of composition and emotional, moral expression (in which there was an appropriate and complementary treatment of the theme and text)&quot;.

If any evidence exists that Webern&#x27;s work does not mark the esoteric &quot;expiry&quot; of Western music in a pianissimo of aphoristic shreds, then it is provided by Luigi Nono&#x27;s &quot;Il Canto Sospeso&quot; ... The 32-year-old composer has proved himself to be the most powerful of Webern&#x27;s successors. (&quot;Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger&quot;, 26 October 1956).

This work, regarded by Swiss musicologist Jürg Stenzl as one of the central masterpieces of the 1950s, is a commemoration of the victims of Fascism, incorporating farewell letters written by political prisoners before execution. Musically, Nono breaks new ground, not only by the &quot;exemplary balance between voices and instruments&quot; but in the motivic, point-like vocal writing in which words are fractured into syllables exchanged between voices to form floating, diversified sonorities—which may be likened to an imaginative extension of Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Klangfarbenmelodie&quot; technique&quot;. Nono himself emphasized his lyrical intentions in an interview with Hansjörg Pauli, and a connection to Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Survivor from Warsaw&quot; is postulated by Guerrero. However, Stockhausen, in his 15 July 1957 Darmstadt lecture, &quot;Sprache und Musik&quot; (published the next year in the &quot;Darmstädter Beiträge zur Neuen Musik&quot; and, subsequently, in &quot;Die Reihe&quot;), stated:

In certain pieces in the &quot;Canto&quot;, Nono composed the text as if to withdraw it from the public eye where it has no place... In sections II, VI, IX and in parts of III, he turns speech into sounds, noises. The texts are not delivered, but rather concealed in such a regardlessly strict and dense musical form that they are hardly comprehensible when performed.

Why, then, texts at all, and why these texts?

Here is an explanation. When setting certain parts of the letters about which one should be particularly ashamed that they had to be written, the musician assumes the attitude only of the composer who had previously selected the letters: he does not interpret, he does not comment. He rather reduces speech to its sounds and makes music with them. Permutations of vowel-sounds, a, ä, e, i, o, u; serial structure.

Should he not have chosen texts so rich in meaning in the first place, but rather sounds? At least for the sections where only the phonetic properties of speech are dealt with.

Nono took strong exception, and informed Stockhausen that it was &quot;incorrect and misleading, and that he had had neither a phonetic treatment of the text nor more or less differentiated degrees of comprehensibility of the words in mind when setting the text&quot;.) Despite Stockhausen&#x27;s contrite acknowledgment, three years later, in a Darmstadt lecture of 8 July 1960 titled &quot;Text—Musik—Gesang&quot;, Nono angrily wrote:

The legacy of these letters became the expression of my composition. And from this relationship between the words as a phonetic-semantic entirety and the music as the composed expression of the words, all of my later choral compositions are to be understood. And it is complete nonsense to conclude, from the analytic treatment of the sound shape of the text, that the semantic content is cast out. The question of why I chose just these texts and no others for a composition is no more intelligent than the question of why, in order to express the word &quot;stupid&quot;, one uses the letters arranged in the order s-t-u-p-i-d.&quot;Il canto sospeso&quot; has been described as an &quot;everlasting warning&quot;; indeed, it is a powerful refutation to the apparent claim made in an often-cited, but out-of-context phrase from philosopher Theodor W. Adorno that &quot;to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric&quot;.

Nono was to return to such anti-fascist subject matter again, as in &quot;Diario polacco; Composizione no. 2&quot; (1958–59), whose background included a journey through the Nazi concentration camps, and the &quot;azione scenica&quot; &quot;Intolleranza 1960&quot;, which caused a riot at its première in Venice, on 13 April 1961.
It was Nono who, in his 1958 lecture &quot;Die Entwicklung der Reihentechnik&quot;, created the expression Darmstadt School to describe the music composed during the 1950s by himself and Pierre Boulez, Bruno Maderna, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and other composers not specifically named by him. He likened their significance to the Bauhaus in the visual arts and architecture.

On 1 September 1959, Nono delivered at Darmstadt a polemically charged lecture written in conjunction with his pupil Helmut Lachenmann, &quot;Geschichte und Gegenwart in der Musik von Heute&quot; (&quot;History and Presence in the Music of Today&quot;), in which he criticised and distanced himself from the composers of chance and aleatoric music, then in vogue, under the influence of American models such as John Cage. Although in a seminar a few days earlier Stockhausen had described himself as &quot;perhaps the extreme antipode to Cage&quot;, when he spoke of &quot;statistical structures&quot; at the concert devoted to his works on the evening of the same day, the Marxist Nono saw this in terms of &quot;fascist mass structures&quot; and a violent argument erupted between the two friends. In combination with Nono&#x27;s strongly negative reaction to Stockhausen&#x27;s interpretation of text-setting in &quot;Il canto sospeso&quot;, this effectively ended their friendship until the 1980s, and thus disbanded the &quot;avant-garde trinity&quot; of Boulez, Nono, and Stockhausen.

===1960s and 1970s===
&quot;Intolleranza 1960&quot; may be viewed as the culmination of the composer&#x27;s early style and aesthetics. The plot concerns the plight of an emigrant captured in a variety of scenarios relevant to modern capitalist society: working class exploitation, street demonstrations, political arrest and torture, concentration camp internment, refuge, and abandonment. Described as a &quot;stage-action&quot;—Nono explicitly forbade the title of &quot;opera&quot;—it utilizes an array of resources from large orchestra, chorus, tape, and loudspeakers to the &quot;magic lantern&quot; technique drawn from Meyerhold and Mayakovsky theatre practices of the 1920s to form a rich expressionist drama. libretto consisting of political slogans, poems, and quotations from Brecht and Sartre (including moments of Brechtian alienation), together with Nono&#x27;s strident, anguished music, fully accords with the anti-capitalist fulmination the composer intended to communicate. The riot at the première in Venice was significantly due to the presence of both left- and right-wing political factions in the audience. Neo-nazis had attempted to disrupt proceedings with stink-bombs, nonetheless failing to prevent the performance ending triumphantly for Nono. &quot;Intolleranza&quot; is dedicated to Schoenberg.

During the 1960s, Nono&#x27;s musical activities became increasingly explicit and polemical in their subject, whether that be the warning against nuclear catastrophe (&quot;Canti di vita e d&#x27;amore: sul ponte di Hiroshima&quot; of 1962), the denunciation of capitalism (&quot;La Fabbrica Illuminata&quot;, 1964), the condemnation of Nazi war criminals in the wake of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials (&quot;Ricorda cosi ti hanno fatto in Auschwitz&quot;, 1965), or of American imperialism in the Vietnam War (&quot;A floresta é jovem e cheja de vida&quot;, 1966). Nono began to incorporate documentary material (political speeches, slogans, extraneous sounds) on tape, and a new use of electronics, that he felt necessary to produce the &quot;concrete situations&quot; relevant to contemporary political issues. The instrumental writing tended to conglomerate the &#x27;punctual&#x27; serial style of the early 1950s into groups, clusters of sounds—broadstrokes that complimented the use of tape collage. In keeping with his Marxist convictions as &#x27;reinterpreted&#x27; through the writings of Antonio Gramsci, he brought this music into universities, trade-unions and factories where he gave lectures and performances. (The title of &quot;A floresta é jovem e cheja de vida&quot; contains a spelling error, the word &quot;full&quot; is &quot;cheia&quot; in Portuguese, not &quot;cheja&quot;.
Nono&#x27;s second period, commonly thought to have begun after &quot;Intolleranza&quot;, reaches its apogee in his second &quot;azione scenica&quot;, &quot;Al gran sole carico d&#x27;amore&quot; (1972–74)—a collaboration with Yuri Lyubimov, who was then director of the Taganka Theatre in Moscow. In this large-scale stage work, Nono completely dispenses with a dramatic narrative, and presents pivotal moments in the history of Communism and class-struggle &quot;side-by-side&quot; to produce his &quot;theatre of consciousness&quot;. The subject matter (as evident from the quotations from manifestos and poems, Marxist classics to the anonymous utterances of workers) deals with failed revolutions; the Paris Commune of 1871, the 1905 Russian Revolution, and the insurgency of militants in 1960s Chile under the leadership of Che Guevara and Tania Bunke. Then extremely topical, &quot;Al gran sole&quot; offers a multi-lateral spectacle and a moving meditation on the history of twentieth-century communism, as viewed through the prism of Nono&#x27;s music. It was premiered at the Teatro Lirico, Milan, in 1975.

During this time, Nono visited the Soviet Union where he awakened the interest of Alfred Schnittke and Arvo Pärt, among others, in the contemporary practices of &quot;avant-garde&quot; composers of the West. Indeed, the 1960s and 70s were marked by frequent travels abroad, lecturing in Latin America, and making the acquaintance of leading left-wing intellectuals and activists. It was to mourn the death of Luciano Cruz, a leader of the Chilean Revolutionary Front, that Nono composed &quot;Como una ola de fuerza y luz&quot; (1972). Very much in the expressionist style of &quot;Al gran sole&quot;, with the use of large orchestra, tape and electronics, it became a kind of piano concerto with added vocal commentary.

Nono returned to the piano (with tape) for his next piece, &quot;... sofferte onde serene ...&quot; (1976), written for his friend Maurizio Pollini after the common bereavement of two of their relatives (See Nono&#x27;s Programme note|Col Legno,1994). With this work began a radically new, intimate phase of the composer&#x27;s development—by way of &quot;Con Luigi Dallapiccola&quot; for percussion and electronics (1978) to &quot;Fragmente-Stille, an Diotima&quot; for string quartet (1980). One of Nono&#x27;s most demanding works (both for performers and listeners), &quot;Fragmente-Stille&quot; is music on the threshold of silence. The score is interspersed with 53 quotations from the poetry of Hölderlin addressed to his &quot;lover&quot; Diotima, which are to be &quot;sung&quot; silently by the players during performance, striving for that &quot;delicate harmony of inner life&quot; (Hölderlin). A sparse, highly concentrated work commissioned by the Beethovenfest in Bonn, &quot;Fragmente-Stille&quot; reawakened great interest in Nono&#x27;s music throughout Germany.

===1980s===

Nono had been introduced to the Venice-based philosopher, Massimo Cacciari (Mayor of Venice from 1993 to 2000), who began to have an increasing influence on the composer&#x27;s thought during the 1980s. Through Cacciari, Nono became immersed in the work of many German philosophers, including the writings of Walter Benjamin whose ideas on history (strikingly similar to the composer&#x27;s own) formed the background to the monumental &quot;Prometeo—tragedia dell&#x27; ascolto&quot; (1984/85). The world premiere of the opera was staged in the Church of San Lorenzo, in Venice, on 25 September 1984, conducted by Claudio Abbado, with texts by Massimo Cacciari, lighting by Emilio Vedova, and wooden structures by Renzo Piano. Nono&#x27;s late music is haunted by Benjamin&#x27;s philosophy, especially the &quot;concept of history&quot; (&quot;Über den Begriff der Geschichte&quot;) which is given a central role in &quot;Prometeo&quot;.

Musically, Nono began to experiment with the new sound possibilities and production at the in Freiburg. There, he devised a new approach to composition and technique, frequently involving the contributions of specialist musicians and technicians to realise his aims. The first fruits of these collaborations were &quot;Das atmende Klarsein&quot; (1981–82), &quot;Diario polacco II&quot; (1982)—an indictment against Soviet Cold War tyranny—and &quot;Guai ai gelidi mostri&quot; (1983). The new technologies allowed the sound to circulate in space, giving this dimension a role no less important than its emission. Such innovations became central to a new conception of time and space. These highly impressive masterworks were partly preparation for what many regard as his greatest achievement.

&quot;Prometeo&quot; has been described as &quot;one of the best works of the 20th century&quot;. After the theatrical excesses of &quot;Al gran sole&quot;, which Nono later remarked were a &quot;monster of resources&quot;, the composer began to think along the lines of an opera or rather a &quot;musica per dramma&quot; without any visual, stage dimension. In short, a drama &quot;in&quot; music—&quot;the tragedy of listening&quot;—the subtitle a comment on consumerism today. Hence, in the vocal parts the most simple intervalic procedures (mainly fourths and fifths) resonate amidst a tapestry of harsh, dissonant, microtonal writing for the ensembles.

&quot;Prometeo&quot; is perhaps the ultimate realisation of Nono&#x27;s &quot;theatre of consciousness&quot;—here, an invisible theatre in which the production of sound and its projection in space become fundamental to the overall dramaturgy. The architect Renzo Piano designed an enormous &#x27;wooden boat&#x27; structure for the première at San Lorenzo church in Venice, whose acoustics must to some extent be reconstructed for each performance. (For the Japanese première at the Akiyoshidai Festival (Shuho), the new concert hall was named &#x27;Prometeo Hall&#x27; in Nono&#x27;s honour, and designed by leading architect Arata Isozaki). The libretto incorporates disparate texts by Hesiod, Hölderlin, and Benjamin (mostly logistically inaudible during performance due to Nono&#x27;s characteristic deconstruction), which explore the origin and evolution of humanity, as compiled and expanded by Cacciari. In Nono&#x27;s timeless and visionary context, music and sound predominate over the image and the written word to form new dimensions of meaning and &quot;new possibilities&quot; for listening.

In 1985, Nono came across this aphorism (&quot;Travellers, there are no trails – all there is, is travelling&quot;) on a wall of the Franciscan monastery near Toledo, Spain, and it played an important role in the rest of his compositions. As Andrew Clements writes about this aphorism in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;It seemed to the composer the perfect expression of his own creative development, and in the last three years of his life he composed a trilogy of works whose titles all derive from that inscription.&quot;
Nono&#x27;s last pieces, such as &quot;Caminantes... Ayacucho&quot; (1986–87), inspired by a region in southern Peru that experiences extreme poverty and social unrest, &quot;La lontananza nostalgica utopica futura&quot; (1988–89), and &quot;&quot;Hay que caminar&quot; soñando&quot; (1989), offer comment on the composer&#x27;s lifelong quest for political renewal and social justice.

Nono died in Venice in 1990. After his funeral, the German composer Dieter Schnebel remarked that he &quot;was a very great man&quot;—a sentiment widely shared by those who knew him, and those who have come to admire his music. Nono is buried in the San Michele cemetery on the Isola di San Michele, alongside other artists like Stravinsky, Diaghilev, Zoran Mušič and Ezra Pound.

Perhaps the three most important collections of Nono&#x27;s writings on music, art, and politics (&quot;Texte: Studien zu seiner Musik&quot; (1975), &quot;Ecrits&quot; (1993), and &quot;Scritti e colloqui&quot; (2001)), as well as the texts collected in Restagno, have yet to be translated into English. Other admirers include architect Daniel Libeskind and novelist Umberto Eco (&quot;Das Nonoprojekt&quot;), for Nono totally reconstructed music and engaged in the most fundamental issues with regards to its expressivity.

The Luigi Nono Archives were established in 1993, through the efforts of Nuria Schoenberg Nono, for the purpose of housing and conserving the Luigi Nono legacy.
