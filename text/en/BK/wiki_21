<text>The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), formerly called the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit civil liberties group founded in 1999 with the mission of protecting freedom of speech on college campuses in the United States. FIRE changed its name in June 2022, when it broadened its focus from colleges to freedom of speech throughout American society.

==Overview==
The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education was co-founded by Alan Charles Kors and Harvey Silverglate in 1999, who were FIRE&#x27;s co-directors until 2004. Kors and Silverglate had co-authored a 1998 book opposing censorship at colleges following the water buffalo incident at the University of Pennsylvania&quot;.&quot; Silverglate had served on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Massachusetts. Kors served as FIRE&#x27;s first president and chairperson. Its first executive director and, later, CEO, was Thor Halvorssen.

FIRE files lawsuits against colleges and universities that it perceives as curtailing First Amendment rights of students and professors. FIRE has been described as a competitor of the ACLU.

FIRE was founded to be non-ideological and nonpartisan. According to a January 2025 article in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, a survey of FIRE email subscribers found 28 percent identify as left-leaning, 32 percent as right-leaning, and the rest as &quot;other.&quot;

FIRE has received major funding from groups which primarily support conservative and libertarian causes, including the Bradley Foundation, Sarah Scaife Foundation, and the Charles Koch Institute. Among its other donors is the Hugh M. Hefner Foundation and Jack Dorsey&#x27;s philanthropic initiative #StartSmall. FIRE president Greg Lukianoff told &quot;Politico&quot; that the center-left Knight Foundation and Bloomberg Philanthropies were also donors.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Cecilia Capuzzi Simon, &quot;There are other groups that fight for First Amendment rights on campus, but none as vocal—or pushy—as FIRE.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; also referred to FIRE as a &quot;familiar irritant to college administrators,&quot; and said FIRE &quot;bristles at the right-wing tag often applied to them.&quot; &quot;New York&quot; magazine has reported that the label may result from FIRE’s historic defense of conservative and heterodox professors and students on college campuses where progressives dominate. Cathy Young, a Cato Institute fellow and columnist for &quot;The Bulwark&quot;, wrote that &quot;FIRE has handled many cases involving speech suppression in the name of progressive values, [but] it is that rare group which actually means it when it claims to be nonpartisan&quot;, noting that it had sued on behalf of a professor who was fired because of a negative tweet about Mike Pence.

In June 2022, FIRE announced it was expanding its efforts beyond college campuses, to American society. It was renamed Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, keeping the acronym FIRE. It detailed a $75 million expansion plan over three years to focus on &quot;litigation, public education, and research.&quot; Josh Gerstein wrote in &quot;Politico&quot; that &quot;part of the push may challenge the American Civil Liberties Union&#x27;s primacy as a defender of free speech.&quot; &quot;Politico&quot; also wrote that FIRE would spend $10 million on &quot;planned national cable and billboard advertising featuring activists on both ends of the political spectrum extolling the virtues of free speech.&quot;

In April 2023, FIRE hosted a gala in New York City to celebrate its expanded mission. The event featured keynote remarks by rapper Killer Mike, who told the audience, &quot;Right now, in this country, your freedom of speech is at risk.&quot;

== Organization ==
FIRE is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with another office in Washington, D.C. As of October 2023, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that FIRE employs 109 people, including 42 lawyers, and has an annual budget of nearly $37 million.

=== Leadership ===
First Amendment attorney and &quot;The Coddling of the American Mind&quot; co-author Greg Lukianoff serves as president and CEO. Nico Perrino is executive vice president. Ira Glasser, former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), serves on FIRE&#x27;s Advisory Council. Former ACLU President Nadine Strossen is a Senior Fellow.

Will Creeley, son of the poet Robert Creeley, is FIRE&#x27;s legal director. When asked about his role at the organization in a January 2025 interview, Creeley said, &quot;I look at the job as being an honest broker, kind of like being an ambulance driver in the culture wars. You just show up and do the job. I want to think of myself as a plumber: They don&#x27;t ask about your politics; they just fix the sink.&quot;

==Policy positions==
=== Campus speech ===
FIRE rates colleges with a red, yellow, or green light based on its assessments of speech restrictions, with a red light meaning that a college policy &quot;both clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech.&quot; FIRE&#x27;s percentage of colleges with &quot;red light&quot; speech codes increased in 2022 for the first time in 15 years. FIRE also gives colleges that do not promise their students free speech rights a &quot;warning&quot; rating. In 2007, Jon B. Gould, an author and George Mason University faculty member, criticized FIRE&#x27;s rating methods, arguing that FIRE had exaggerated the prevalence of unconstitutional speech codes.

In 2020, FIRE partnered with College Pulse and RealClearEducation to release the College Free Speech Rankings, a comparison of student free-speech environments at America&#x27;s top college campuses. The rankings incorporate FIRE&#x27;s speech code ratings, but also include surveys of students at the ranked schools. In their 2025 rankings, FIRE and College Pulse ranked more than 250 schools and surveyed over 58,000 students, with the University of Virginia achieving the top ranking and Harvard University ranking last.

FIRE has challenged free speech zones on college campuses, claiming they are unconstitutional restrictions on First Amendment rights. The organization has provided legal support to students contesting free speech zones, while also supporting legislation to eliminate such zones. In his book &quot;Speech Out of Doors: Preserving First Amendment Liberties in Public Places&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 2008), law professor Timothy Zick wrote &quot;in large part due to [FIRE&#x27;s] litigation and other advocacy efforts, campus expressive zoning policies have been highlighted, altered, and in a number of cases repealed.&quot;

During campus protests over the Israel–Hamas war, FIRE representatives have said that colleges and universities can enact &quot;reasonable time, place, and manner&quot; restrictions but they must be applied in &quot;a content viewpoint neutral manner&quot;.

=== Social media censorship ===
FIRE opposes efforts by the government to pressure private social media companies to censor speech on their platforms. The group argues that &quot;efforts to &#x27;jawbone&#x27; private platforms into granting government officials a role in decisions about content moderation must fail.&quot; FIRE chief counsel Robert Corn-Revere called a federal judge&#x27;s 2023 order blocking the government from pressuring social media companies to censor &quot;a win for the First Amendment.&quot;

=== Challenges to college residence life programs ===
In 2007, the organization said that a mandatory program for students living in dormitories at the University of Delaware resembled &quot;thought reform&quot;. The school suspended it.

=== Student press ===
At the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh, FIRE opposed university practices that required student journalists to submit their questions ahead of time or seek permission from the school before interviewing university employees. After FIRE intervened, the university revised its practices to no longer require prior approval before interviews.

=== Campus security fees ===
FIRE has opposed security fees some campuses charge to groups which host controversial speakers. These fees are charged to pay for extra security, which colleges say is necessary due to the likelihood of demonstrations and disruption of events.

In March 2009, FIRE challenged a security fee charged to a UC Berkeley group for a speech by Elan Journo, who advocates for the destruction of Palestine. In 2014, FIRE assisted the Kalamazoo Peace Center in its lawsuit against Western Michigan University, after the university said the peace center could only invite social activist and rapper Boots Riley to speak on campus if it paid a security fee. The school settled the lawsuit and agreed to revise its policies. In April 2022, FIRE challenged a security fee charged to Dartmouth College&#x27;s Republican group for hosting a speech by Andy Ngo.

=== Due process ===
FIRE also targets situations where students and faculty are adjudicated outside the bounds of due process afforded to them by Constitutional law or stated university policy.

FIRE has argued for more rights for students facing sexual assault allegations. In 2011, FIRE opposed the Education Department&#x27;s &quot;Dear Colleague&quot; letter that urged universities to use a &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; standard instead of the criminal justice system&#x27;s &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; standard in sexual assault cases. In 2020, FIRE supported new rules made by the Department of Education during the Trump administration about sexual assault and harassment cases that required colleges to allow the cross-examination of accusers.

=== Diversity, equity, and inclusion ===
FIRE opposes some diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts on college campuses that it says infringe on the free speech and academic freedom rights of students and faculty members. For example, FIRE objects to mandatory &quot;diversity statements&quot; that require faculty to explain their commitment to DEI as part of the hiring and evaluation process. The group argues that such requirements can function as &quot;political litmus tests&quot; that force faculty to accept certain &quot;political or ideological viewpoints for which there is no consensus.&quot; It has drafted model legislation to abolish the use of diversity statements.

In 2023, FIRE released a survey that asked 1,500 college faculty for their views on the use of diversity statements. Half of the respondents said they are &quot;a justifiable requirement for a job at a university.&quot; The other half of respondents claimed they are &quot;an ideological litmus test that violates academic freedom,&quot; including 90 percent of conservative faculty. Later that year, FIRE filed a lawsuit against the California Community Colleges system, which the organization says forces professors to promote politicized DEI concepts.

=== Public and private universities ===
FIRE has argued that public schools are required to uphold First Amendment protections for their students and faculty members because they are government entities. Although private schools are not bound by the First Amendment, FIRE has said contractual promises they make related to free speech or academic freedom should be upheld.

=== &quot;Institutional neutrality&quot; ===
FIRE has pushed for colleges and universities to enact &quot;institutional neutrality&quot; policies, which call for administrators to refrain from speaking on contentious political and social issues. In February 2024, FIRE, Heterodox Academy, and the Academic Freedom Alliance released a joint open letter calling for institutional neutrality.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
In February 2024, Lukianoff testified before Congress on artificial intelligence-powered censorship and propaganda tools. He said, &quot;[The] most chilling threat that the government poses in the context of emerging AI is regulatory overreach that limits its potential as a tool for contributing to human knowledge.&quot;

==Cases==

===Public universities===
FIRE joined with a number of other civil liberties groups in the case of &quot;Hosty v. Carter&quot;, involving suppression of a student newspaper at Governors State University in Illinois, and has been involved in a case at Arizona State University where it condemned the listing of certain sections of a class as open only to Native American students.

FIRE sparred with the University of New Hampshire in 2004 over its treatment of student Timothy Garneau, who was expelled from student housing after he wrote and distributed a flier joking that female classmates could lose the &quot;freshman fifteen&quot; by taking the stairs instead of the elevator. After FIRE publicly criticized the decision, Garneau was reinstated.

In May 2007, Valdosta State University expelled T. Hayden Barnes, who had protested against the construction of two new parking garages on the campus which he saw as encouraging the use of private transportation. University president Ronald Zaccari misconstrued a caption of the proposed garages as the &quot;Ronald Zaccari Memorial Parking Garage&quot; as a threat to himself. With FIRE support, the expulsion was overturned and a court found VSU to have violated Barnes&#x27;s due process rights.

In 2008, college professor Kerry Laird was ordered by Temple College to remove the quote, &quot;Gott ist tot&quot; (God is Dead), a famous quote from Friedrich Nietzsche, from his office door. FIRE wrote a letter to the Temple administration hinting at the possibility of legal action.

In October 2011, Catawba Valley Community College suspended a student (Marc Bechtol) for complaining on Facebook about a new policy that required students to sign up for a debit card to get their student ID and grant money. CVCC decided that the comments were &quot;disturbing&quot; and a &quot;threat&quot;, and used that reasoning to suspend the student. FIRE took the side of the student. Charges were dropped in December 2011.

In 2012, FIRE filed a lawsuit against Iowa State University (ISU) after ISU prevented the university&#x27;s chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws from designing T-shirts featuring the school&#x27;s mascot. The lawsuit eventually ended with nearly $1 million in damages and fees awarded.

In 2014, FIRE sued Chicago State University (CSU) for trying to shut down a faculty blog critical of CSU&#x27;s former administration. The school eventually agreed to rewrite its speech policies, paying $650,000 to settle the lawsuit.

In 2021, FIRE filed a First Amendment lawsuit on behalf of an Eastern Virginia Medical School student who said his free speech rights were violated when the school denied recognition to a club that he was trying to establish because it supported universal health care. In March 2022, the school settled the lawsuit. Later that year, the organization helped Stuart Reges, a professor of the University of Washington&#x27;s Allen School of Computer Science, sue the school in &quot;Reges v. Cauce&quot; after it recommended that he include a Native American &quot;land acknowledgment&quot; on his course syllabus. FIRE is also representing conservative students at California-based Clovis Community College, where school administrators reportedly removed the students&#x27; anti-communism flyers from campus bulletin boards.

In 2021, in response to the board of trustees at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill declining to give Nikole Hannah-Jones tenure, FIRE released a statement saying &quot;if it is accurate that this refusal was the result of viewpoint discrimination against Hannah-Jones, particularly based on political opposition to her appointment, this decision has disturbing implications for academic freedom.&quot;

In September 2022, FIRE announced a lawsuit challenging Florida&#x27;s Stop WOKE Act, arguing that the bill unconstitutionally suppresses certain discussions of race and sex on college campuses. That November, a federal judge considering lawsuits by FIRE and the ACLU stopped enforcement of the higher education portions of the law, calling them &quot;positively dystopian&quot; and ruling that the law violates the rights of university students and faculty members. &quot;New York Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Jonathan Chait wrote that, while FIRE &quot;has stood up against speech restriction from both the right and the left,&quot; it was notable that &quot;the most effective opponent of left-wing political correctness&quot; had led the effort against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis&#x27; &quot;signature campus law.&quot;

In March 2023, FIRE filed a lawsuit challenging a ban on student drag shows at West Texas A&amp;M University, which the group called an &quot;unlawful attempt to censor students.&quot; In a letter to the campus community, university president Walter Wendler called drag shows &quot;divisive&quot; and &quot;demeaning&quot; to women, despite acknowledging that the law appeared to require him to allow such shows.

===Private universities===
FIRE has criticized Columbia University&#x27;s sexual misconduct policy; according to FIRE, the policy &quot;lack[ed] even the most minimal safeguards and fundamental principles of fairness&quot;. The criticism led to the resignation of Charlene Allen, Columbia&#x27;s program coordinator for the Office of Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Education, whose policies were at the center of the controversy.

FIRE criticized Brandeis University for disciplining politics professor Donald Hindley. The school&#x27;s provost informed Hindley in October 2007 that comments he made in his Latin American politics class violated the school&#x27;s anti-harassment policy. Hindley was alleged to have mentioned the slur &quot;wetback&quot; in class during a discussion about racism toward Mexican-American immigrants. Krauss placed a monitor in Hindley&#x27;s class and ordered him to attend racial sensitivity training.

In 2015, FIRE defended Erika Christakis, associate master of Yale University&#x27;s Silliman College, after she questioned the school&#x27;s Intercultural Affairs Council for highlighting the cultural implications of Halloween costumes.

In 2021, FIRE advocated on behalf of Stanford University student Nicholas Wallace, who satirized the Federalist Society and Republican political figures in an email to his peers. Wallace&#x27;s diploma was initially put on hold for the email, prompting FIRE to contact Stanford in his defense. The school&#x27;s investigation was ultimately dropped and Wallace was allowed to graduate.

In 2022, FIRE released a series of advertisements in Boston, Massachusetts, accusing Emerson College of censoring free speech on campus. The ad campaign came in response to Emerson investigating and suspending the campus chapter of Turning Point USA, which distributed stickers featuring a hammer and sickle with the caption &quot;China Kinda Sus&quot; (slang for &quot;suspicious&quot;). Emerson claimed the stickers represented &quot;anti-China hate&quot;, while FIRE blamed the school for violating &quot;freedom of expression&quot;.

FIRE objected to Hamline University&#x27;s 2022 decision to punish adjunct professor Erika López Prater after she showed students in her art history course a painting of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. FIRE argued this violated the professor&#x27;s academic freedom rights, filing a complaint with the university&#x27;s accreditor.

=== Off-campus ===
In August 2022, FIRE defended the nonprofit group NeuroClastic, which had been threatened with a defamation lawsuit by the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center after criticizing the center&#x27;s use of electro-shock devices. That month, FIRE challenged the New York State Senate&#x27;s practice of blocking critics on Twitter, representing a resident who had criticized gun control legislation.

FIRE filed a lawsuit in December 2022 on behalf of First Amendment scholar Eugene Volokh and online platforms Rumble and Locals, challenging a New York state law that requires social networks to police hate speech on their platforms. Writing in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; after the lawsuit was filed, Volokh claimed, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to moderate such content and I don&#x27;t endorse the state&#x27;s definition of hate speech.&quot; In February 2023, a federal judge blocked the law, writing that it &quot;chills the constitutionally protected speech of social media users, without articulating a compelling governmental interest or ensuring that the law is narrowly tailored to that goal.&quot;

In 2022, FIRE filed a lawsuit against the city of Eastpointe, Michigan and its mayor, Monique Owens. The lawsuit alleged that Owens unconstitutionally shut down residents&#x27; criticism of her during the public comment period of city council meetings. That December, a federal judge issued an injunction that prevented Owens from interrupting or shutting down speakers at council meetings. In April 2024, the city of Eastpointe agreed to a settlement with FIRE that designated September 6 (the day that Owens shouted down residents) as “First Amendment Day.&quot;

In 2024, FIRE represented an Arizona mother who was arrested at a city council meeting for criticizing a public official, with Maricopa County Judge Gerald Williams ultimately throwing out the charges.

In 2025, FIRE announced that it would defend Iowa pollster Ann Selzer against a consumer fraud lawsuit from President-elect Donald Trump over a poll released ahead of the 2024 United States presidential election which incorrectly predicted that Trump&#x27;s opponent Kamala Harris would win the state of Iowa. FIRE called the lawsuit &quot;the very definition of a &#x27;SLAPP&#x27; suit — a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation.&quot;

== Media, advertising, and sponsorships ==
Since 2011, FIRE has published a list of the &quot;worst colleges for free speech&quot;.

Since 2016, FIRE has produced &quot;So to Speak: The Free Speech Podcast&quot;, hosted by Perrino. FIRE partnered with Korchula Productions and the DKT Liberty Project to produce &quot;Can We Take a Joke?&quot;, a documentary released in 2016 about comedy and speech.

In 2017, FIRE was listed as one of the sponsors of the conservative campus group Turning Point USA&#x27;s Student Action Summit, according to tax records.

In 2020, FIRE released &quot;Mighty Ira&quot;, a documentary about Ira Glasser, focusing on his advocacy for free speech and civil rights. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described it as &quot;a warm portrait that poses ever-urgent questions.&quot; &quot;The Times of Israel&quot; said the documentary &quot;initiates a war between your head and your gut.&quot;

In 2022, FIRE produced an advertisement featuring National Basketball Association (NBA) player Enes Kanter Freedom for the 2022 Winter Olympics in China, supporting freedom of speech. Freedom also shared his personal story about censorship in his home country of Turkey.

<text>Planning is the process of thinking regarding the activities required to achieve a desired goal. Planning is based on foresight, the fundamental capacity for mental time travel. Some researchers regard the evolution of forethought - the capacity to think ahead - as a prime mover in human evolution.
Planning is a fundamental property of intelligent behavior. It involves the use of logic and imagination to visualize not only a desired result, but the steps necessary to achieve that result.

An important aspect of planning is its relationship to forecasting. Forecasting aims to predict what the future will look like, while planning imagines what the future could look like.

Planning according to established principles - most notably since the early-20th century -
forms a core part of many professional occupations, particularly in fields such as management and business. Once people have developed a plan, they can measure and assess progress, efficiency and effectiveness. As circumstances change, plans may need to be modified or even abandoned.

In light of the popularity of the concept of planning, some adherents of the idea advocate planning for unplannable eventualities.

== Psychology ==
Planning has been modeled in terms of &quot;intentions&quot;: deciding what tasks one might wish to do; &quot;tenacity&quot;: continuing towards a goal in the face of difficulty and &quot;flexibility&quot;, adapting one&#x27;s approach in response implementation. An &quot;implementation intention&quot; is a specification of behavior that an individual believes to be correlated with a goal will take place, such as at a particular time or in a particular place. Implementation intentions are distinguished from goal intentions, which specifies an outcome such as running a marathon.

==Neurology==

Planning is one of the executive functions of the brain, encompassing the neurological processes involved in the formulation, evaluation and selection of a sequence of thoughts and actions to achieve a desired goal. Various studies utilizing a combination of neuropsychological, neuropharmacological and functional neuroimaging approaches have suggested there is a positive relationship between impaired planning ability and damage to the frontal lobe.

A specific area within the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex located in the frontal lobe has been implicated as playing an intrinsic role in both cognitive planning and associated executive traits such as working memory.

Disruption of the neural pathways, via various mechanisms such as traumatic brain injury, or the effects of neurodegenerative diseases between this area of the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia, specifically the striatum (corticostriatal pathway), may disrupt the processes required for normal planning function.

Individuals who were born very low birth weight (&lt;1500 grams) and extremely low birth weight are at greater risk for various cognitive deficits including planning ability.

The other region activated in planning process is default mode network which contributes to activity of remembering the past and imagine the future. This network distributed set of regions that involve association cortex and paralimbic region but spare sensory and motor cortex this is make possible planning process disruption by active task that uses sensory and motoric regions.

===Neuropsychological tests===

There are a variety of neuropsychological tests which can be used to measure variance of planning ability between the subject and controls.

* Tower of Hanoi, a puzzle invented in 1883 by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas. There are different variations of the puzzle: the classic version consists of three rods and usually seven to nine discs of subsequently smaller size. Planning is a key component of the problem-solving skills necessary to achieve the objective, which is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:
** Only one disk may be moved at a time.
** Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.
** No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
* Tower of London is another test that was developed in 1992 by Tim Shallice specifically to detect deficits in planning as may occur with damage to the frontal lobe. Test participants with damage to the left anterior frontal lobe demonstrated planning deficits (i.e., greater number of moves required for solution).

Test participants with damage to the right anterior, and left or right posterior areas of the frontal lobes, showed no impairment. The results implicating the left anterior frontal lobes involvement in solving the Tower of London were supported in concomitant neuroimaging studies which also showed a reduction in regional cerebral blood flow to the left pre-frontal lobe. For the number of moves, a significant negative correlation was observed for the left prefrontal area: i.e. subjects that took more time planning their moves showed greater activation in the left prefrontal area.

== Planning theories ==
=== Business ===
Patrick Montana and Bruce Charnov outline a three-step result-oriented process for planning: 
# Choosing a destination
# Evaluating alternative routes
# Deciding the specific course of the plan

In organizations, planning can become a management process, concerned with defining goals for a future direction and determining on the missions and resources to achieve those targets. To meet the goals, managers may develop plans such as a business plan or a marketing plan. Planning always has a purpose. The purpose may involve the achievement of certain goals or targets: efficient use of resources, reducing risk, expanding the organization and its assets, etc.

=== Public policy ===
Public policies include laws, rules, decisions, and decrees. Public policy can be defined as efforts to tackle social issues via policymaking. A policy is crafted with a specific goal in mind in order to address a societal problem that has been prioritized by the government.

Public policy planning includes environmental, land use, regional, urban and spatial planning. In many countries, the operation of a town and country planning system is often referred to as &quot;planning&quot; and the professionals which operate the system are known as &quot;planners&quot;.

It is a conscious as well as sub-conscious activity. It is &quot;an anticipatory decision making process&quot; that helps in coping with complexities. It is deciding future course of action from amongst alternatives. It is a process that involves making and evaluating each set of interrelated decisions. It is selection of missions, objectives and &quot;translation of knowledge into action.&quot; A planned performance brings better results compared to an unplanned one. A manager&#x27;s job is planning, monitoring and controlling. Planning and goal setting are important traits of an organization. It is done at all levels of the organization. Planning includes the plan, the thought process, action, and implementation. Planning gives more power over the future. Planning is deciding in advance what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and who should do it. This bridges the gap from where the organization is to where it wants to be. The planning function involves establishing goals and arranging them in logical order. An organization that plans well achieves goals faster than one that does not plan before implementation.

===Personal===
Planning is not just a professional activity: it is a feature of everyday life, whether for career advancement, organizing an event or even just getting through a busy day.

== Alternatives to planning ==
Opportunism can supplement or replace planning.

<text>Fayez Banihammad (March 19, 1977September 11, 2001) was an Emirati terrorist hijacker from al-Qaeda who was one of the five terrorist hijackers aboard United Airlines Flight 175 that was flown into the South Tower of the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks.

In 1999, Banihammad left the United Arab Emirates for Saudi Arabia, where he joined the al-Qaeda terrorist group. He met Mustafa al Hawsawi, who allegedly funded the attacks. He entered the United States with a tourist visa, and on August 29, 2001, Banihammad paid for his flight ticket. Flight 175 was meant to fly from Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport to Los Angeles. On the day of the attacks, after the plane took off, his group of hijackers forced their way into the cockpit. Marwan al-Shehhi, the only other Emirati involved in the attacks, took control of the plane, and flew it into the World Trade Center South Tower, killing everyone onboard.

== Early life ==
Fayez Rashid Ahmed Hassan al-Qadi Banihammad (who used many aliases but is mainly known as Fayez Banihammad) was born on March 19, 1977. He was allegedly the son of a school principal, and grew up in the Khor Fakkan region of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Banihammad&#x27;s family claimed he left the UAE in 1999, saying he was going to join an Islamic relief organization. Instead, he would go to Saudi Arabia, where he joined the al-Qaeda terrorist group. He and his family had only one phone call after he left.

== September 11 attacks ==
=== Background ===
The September 11 attacks were a series of terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, formulated by the al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammad. They would be committed by 19 attackers, targeting four locations with hijacked commercial planes. Three of these locations were each of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. The fourth target was potentially the U.S Capitol Building, but the fourth plane was unsuccessful in hitting it, because of a revolt by its passengers.

Banihammad was one of the hijackers. He was described as one of the &quot;bit players&quot; within his group, which targeted the World Trade Center&#x27;s South Tower. The others were Ahmed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Mohand al-Shehri. However, he still played a &quot;unique role&quot; in his group; during his time in Saudi Arabia, he met Saudi businessman Mustafa al Hawsawi, who is alleged to have funded the attacks. Banihammad had previously spent one year at university with al-Shehri. He was one of two Emiratis to participate in the attacks, the other being al-Shehhi. At the time of the attacks, he was 24.

=== Planning ===
Banihammad received his tourist visa on June 18, 2001, one of three hijackers which received their visa much later than the others. Khalid Sheikh Mohammad claimed these three hijackers were not replacements for unsuccessful candidates, but rather extra men to increase the odds of success. Before arriving in the United States, he made bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates, at the same bank and time as Hawsawi. Familiar with the country&#x27;s procedures, Banihammad helped Hawsawi complete his account application. He gave Hawsawi $3,000 and granted him power of attorney over his own account, so Hawsawi could forward a bank card to him while he was in the United States. This is likely when Hawsawi&#x27;s role as a financial facilitator of the attacks began. $30,000 was deposited into Banihammad&#x27;s account on June 25. On June 27, he arrived in the United States using his tourist visa. He landed at Orlando after taking a flight from London. After that, he made Visa and ATM withdrawals from his UAE accounts.

Banihammad most likely lived in Florida during the planning, potentially with al-Shehhi and Mohammed Atta (the attacks&#x27; mastermind) at their apartment in Hollywood, or with other hijackers. He reportedly took flight lessons with Atta in Florida. His pilot&#x27;s license had an address for a flight school in Tulsa, but the school had no record of him attending. A person with his name did attend the Lackland Air Force Base Defense Language Institute in San Antonio. In July, he rented a postal box at Mail Boxes Etc. in Delray Beach, and on August 29, he paid for a first-class seat, 2A, on United Airlines Flight 175, using the postal address. The flight was scheduled to fly from Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport to Los Angeles on September 11. It would depart from Logan Airport along with American Airlines Flight 11, which Atta was on.

In early September, Mustafa al-Hawsawi received a Western Union transfer of $26,000 from Atta, brothers Marwan and Waleed al-Shehri, and Banihammad. The FBI believed this transaction was the hijackers returning their unused funds as they did not want to &quot;die as thieves&quot;. al-Hisawi later cleaned out Banihammad&#x27;s bank account in Dubai, and he could do so because he had power of attorney over it.

=== Day of the attacks ===

On September 11, Banihammad and his group checked in for Flight 175, which was scheduled to depart at 8:00 a.m. They were armed with knives and mace, but none of them were checked by CAPPS. Between 7:23 and 7:28, the group boarded. Banihammad sat in seat 2A. There were 56 passengers and 9 crew onboard in total. At some point, while both Flight 11 and 175 were on the Logan tarmac, Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi talked on their cell phones, confirming their final plan. 175 departed Logan at 8:14. Around 8:42 to 8:46, the hijackers likely forced their way into the cockpit and stabbed the pilots to death. One of the hijackers stabbed the flight crew and told the other passengers to get back. Shehhi started controlling the plane. Five minutes later, he changed course.

At approximately 9:03 a.m., Flight 175 struck the South Tower. The plane, flying at 540 miles per hour, hit the 81st floor, and made a hole from the 77th to the 85th floors. All 65 people onboard the plane, including the hijackers, died. Flights 11 and 175 each heavily damaged their respective targets, and both towers collapsed. The South Tower collapsed first, at 9:59 a.m. More than 600 deaths came from the attack on the South Tower.

== Aftermath ==
During the FBI&#x27;s investigation into the attacks, they learned from Ahmed al-Hada, the father-in-law of hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar, that Banihammad was Emirati. Banihammad was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment of Zacarias Moussaoui.

<doc id="378018" wikidata="Q1116037" url="?curid=378018" title="Common-channel signaling">
<text>In telecommunications, common-channel signaling (CCS), or common-channel interoffice signaling (CCIS), is the transmission of control information &quot;(signaling)&quot; via a separate channel than that used for the messages, The signaling channel usually controls multiple message channels.

In the public switched telephone network (PSTN) one channel of a communications link is typically used for the sole purpose of carrying signaling for establishment and tear down of telephone calls. The remaining channels are used entirely for the transmission of voice messages. In most cases, a single channel is sufficient to handle the call setup and call clear-down traffic for numerous bearer (voice and data) channels.

The technical alternative to CCS is channel-associated signaling (CAS), in which each bearer channel has a dedicated signaling channel.

CCS offers the following advantages over CAS, in the context of the PSTN:
* Faster call set-up time
* Greater trunking efficiency due to the quicker set up and clearing, thereby reducing traffic on the network
* Can transfer additional information along with the signaling traffic, providing features such as caller ID
* Signaling can be performed mid-call

The most common CCS signaling methods in use are Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Signalling System No. 7 (SS7).

ISDN signaling is used primarily on trunks connecting end-user private branch exchange (PBX) systems to a central office. SS7 is primarily used within the PSTN. The two signaling methods are very similar since they share a common heritage and in some cases, the same signaling messages are transmitted in both ISDN and SS7.

==Common channel signaling networks==
A CCS network provides signaling message transfer for participating Common Channel Signaling Switching Offices (CCSSOs), databases, and operator systems. It is a packet-switched communication network that allows call control and transaction messages from the voice and data networks to be transferred on communications paths that are separate from the voice and data connections.

CCS messages provide for transaction-based services and for call control signaling between network nodes. The architecture for a CCS network is generally based on the geographical location of signaling points, the number and sizes of signaling points, the expected traffic load, and the services to be provided by the network.

Regardless of the type of architecture selected, the CCS network will consist of a combination of the following components:

*Signaling Link - A communication path between two adjacent Signaling Points (SPs) in the CCS network.
*Link Set - A set of signaling links that connects the same pair of adjacent signaling points.
*Combined Link Set - A collection of link sets from a signaling node over which message traffic to a given destination is shared. 
*Signaling Point (SP) - An SP transmits, receives, and processes CCS(SS7) messages. An SP can be a Signaling End Point (SEP) or a Signaling Transfer Point (STP).
*Signaling Transfer Point (STP) - An SP that performs message routing functions and provides switching of messages between SEPs.
*Signaling End Point (SEP) - An SP, other than an STP, with the ability to serve as a source or a sink for CCS messages.
*Service Control Point (SCP) - An SEP that acts as a database to provide information to another SEP, e.g., a Service Switching Point (SSP) or another SCP, for processing and/or routing certain types of network calls.
*Signaling Gateway - Responsible for exchanging SS7 messages over a set of links from an SS7 node in a Voice Over Packet (VOP) network to a traditional PSTN network and encapsulating the user information (either ISUP for call setup or SCCP/TCAP for service related signaling) contained in the message for distribution to the Call Control Agent (CCA).
*Internet Call Router (ICR) - Also called the Internet Offload, the ICR is a new network element used in the “post-switch&quot; off-load architecture.
*Switch - An SEP that is equipped to switch end user voice or data calls.
*Combined Node (CN) – An SP that combines the functions of two or more types of SPs.
*A-Link Concentrator (ALC) - An SP that has the Message Transfer Part (MTP) functionality of an STP and also serves as a CCSSO.

===Interconnecting CCS networks===
As CCS networks have continued to evolve, and network interconnection architectures and the services they support have grown more complex, it has become necessary to identify the type of behavior all network providers are expected to exhibit when specific requirements do not exist.

Providers of Interconnecting CCS networks and other interconnecting networks need information about the processes and interfaces that need to be supported to ensure that call originations routed via other interconnecting networks receive at least the same quality of service as intranetwork calls.

Telcordia GR-905, &quot;Common Channel Signaling Network Interface Specification (CCSNIS) Supporting Network Interconnection, Message Transfer Part (MTP), and Integrated Services Digital Network User Part (ISDNU),&quot; contains this important information and includes information for providers of Legacy Network Gateway and Legacy Selective Router Gateway systems to support the delivery of emergency calls between legacy origination networks and IP-enabled PSAPs, as well as emergency calls routed via Emergency Services IP Networks (ESInets) and legacy PSAPs that are served by Selective Routers. It provides explicit references to ANSI and ATIS Standards and ITU-T Recommendations.

<text>Syrian Airlines (), operating as SyrianAir (), is the flag carrier of Syria. It operates scheduled international services to several destinations in Asia, Europe and North Africa, though the number of flights operated has seriously declined since 2011 due to the Arab Spring and subsequent Syrian war. SyrianAir previously served over 50 destinations worldwide. Its main bases are Damascus International Airport and previously Aleppo International Airport. The company has its head office on the fifth floor of the Social Insurance Building in Damascus.

==History==
===Early years: Syrian Airways 1946–1958===
Syrian Airways was established in 1946, with two propeller aircraft and started to fly between a domestic networks such as Damascus, Aleppo, Deir ez-Zour, Palmyra and Qamishli. The airline started its operations in June 1947 using two Beechcraft Model 18s and three Douglas DC-3 (C-47 Dakota). The Dakotas had been acquired from Pan American World Airways (PAA), which provided technical assistance to Syrian Airways during the first years of operation. 

Syrian Airways also operated a regional network, with flights to Beirut, Baghdad, Jerusalem, Amman; followed by Cairo, Kuwait, Doha and Jeddah. The airline expanded during the next years to include Beirut, Baghdad, and Jerusalem, then Cairo, Kuwait and Doha, in addition to flights during the &quot;hajj&quot;. 

Financial difficulties and the 1948 Arab–Israeli War led to the withdrawal of PAA and caused the suspension of service until mid-1951. The operation was resumed after receiving government support in 1952. In 1952, the airline was provided with three Douglas DC-3s and with four Douglas DC-4s in 1954, and in 1957 it received four Douglas DC-6s in the name of United Arab Airline. 

On December 21, 1953, one of the airline&#x27;s Douglas planes crashed near Damascus killing all nine aboard. The airline&#x27;s operating permit was cancelled following the crash. The airline was allowed to fly again in 1954. The Model 18s had been returned to the Syrian Air Force in 1949, while four additional Dakotas were acquired between 1952 and 1956.

One of the older Dakotas (YK-AAE) crashed during its climb out of Aleppo&#x27;s Nayrab Airport on February 24, 1956, during a heavy storm. The 19 people on board died in the airline&#x27;s worst accident to date. Newer and stronger planes were consequently added to the fleet in the mid-fifties: two Douglas DC-4/C-54 Skymaster, followed by a Douglas DC-4-1009 acquired from Swissair in December 1958, complementing an active fleet of four Douglas C47 Dakotas. The network was expanded to Dhahran in the Persian Gulf while frequencies were reinforced elsewhere.

===Merger with Misrair: United Arab Airlines 1958–1961===

In February 1958, Syria and Egypt decided to unite under the leadership of president Gamal Abdel Nasser, and the two countries became provinces of the United Arab Republic (UAR). The merger between Syrian Airways and Misrair, the state-owned airlines of Syria and Egypt came as a consequence of this political union. The airlines merged on December 25, 1958, to form United Arab Airlines (UAA). At the time of the merger, Syrian Airways was still only a small regional airline while its Egyptian counterpart, Misrair, was the largest and oldest airline in the Arab world, operating an extensive network out of Cairo, the region&#x27;s metropolis.
During the UAA interlude, only regional and domestic routes were operated in Syria, flights further afield connected at the Cairo hub. Two planes inherited from Syrian Airways were written off between 1959 and 1961: the Douglas DC-4-1009 which was ditched in the Congo River as it was carrying cargo from Accra to Leopoldville on September 1, 1960, and a Dakota which crashed on its final approach of Qamishli on a domestic flight from Aleppo on May 6, 1961. Fortunately, there were no fatalities in either accident.

The union between Egypt and Syria ended on September 26, 1961, amidst tensions between the leaderships of the two provinces of the UAR. The Syrian Arab Republic was declared in Syria, while Egypt chose to continue to carry the title of UAR until 1971. In parallel to that divorce, Syria withdrew from UAA. All the airliners previously owned by Syrian Airways, two Douglas DC-6Bs and one Douglas DC6B freighter were given up by UAA to the Syrian authorities.

===Rebirth of a national flag carrier: Syrian Arab Airlines 1961–1969===

Syrian Arab Airlines (S.A.A.L.) was founded in October 1961 to take over UAA&#x27;s operations in Syria and to become the new national airline. The fleet initially consisted of three Douglas C-47 Dakotas, two Douglas C-54 Skymasters, two Douglas DC-6Bs and one Douglas DC-6B freighter (later sold to LAC Colombia). Domestic and regional flights were promptly resumed and the fleet originally was painted in a green livery reminiscent of that of the Syrian Airways colors.

S.A.A.L. purchased a third DC-6B from SAS in November 1962. Flights to European destinations (Rome and Munich) were started in 1963, followed by flights to London and Paris (Le Bourget), Karachi and Delhi in 1964. A new livery was introduced then, with alternating dark blue and red stripes for the cheatline. 

Syrian Arab Airlines became a founding member of the Arab Air Carriers&#x27; Organization (AACO) and entered the jet age in 1965, with the purchase of two Sud Aviation 210 Super- Caravelle 10B3s.
 These jets enabled the airline to expand and reinforce its network with the addition of flights to Luxembourg, Prague, Athens, Istanbul, Teheran and Bahrain. A slightly altered livery was introduced for the occasion, removing the parallel stripes from the fin and removing the red stripes from the cheatline. In 1966, a pool partnership with Middle East Airlines – Air Liban was signed and a twice-daily rotation between Beirut and Damascus was launched. The summer 1966 timetable below clearly reflects the airline&#x27;s growth and modernisation.

In 1966, Syrian Arab Airlines used the Caravelles on flights to Europe (London, Paris, Munich, Rome, Athens and Nicosia) as well as high-density Middle Eastern routes (Baghdad, Teheran, Jeddah, Kuwait, Doha, Sharjah) and on flights to South Asia (Karachi and Delhi). 

Routings were as follows: Eastbound and Lebanon: Damascus-Aleppo-Beirut (DC3) 3 times a week, Aleppo-Beirut (by MEA/pool partnership Viscount) 2X, Damascus-Beirut (DC4 for RB and Viscount for ME) twice daily, Damascus-Jerusalem (DC3 and DC4) 2X, Damascus-Baghdad-Teheran (DC6 and Caravelle) 2X, Damascus-Jeddah (Caravelle) 1X, Damascus-Kuwait (2XCRV, 1XDC6) 3X, Damascus-Bahrain (DC6) 1X, Damascus-Doha-Sharjah (DC6) 1X, Damascus-Doha-Sharjah-Karachi-Delhi (Caravelle) 1X, Damascus-Dhahran-Sharjah-Karachi (Caravelle) 1X.
Westbound: Damascus-Athens-Rome-Munich-London (Caravelle) 1X, Damascus-Istanbul-Prague-Luxembourg (DC6) 1X, Damascus-Nicosia (DC4) 1X, Damascus-Athens-Munich-Paris-London (Caravelle) 1X, Damascus-Aleppo-Istanbul-Luxembourg (DC6) 1X, Damascus-Nicosia-Rome-Paris-London (Caravelle) 1X.
Domestic: Damascus-Latakia (DC3)X5, Damascus-Palmyra-Deirezzor (DC4)X3, Damascus-Deirezzor-Aleppo (DC3)2X, Damascus-Deirezzor (DC3) 1X, Damascus-Aleppo-Qamishli (DC3X2, DC4X4) X6, Damascus-Aleppo (DC3)X5 (including the flights continuing to Beirut).

Luxembourg was a rare destination for carriers in the Middle East in the 1960s; in addition to cargo, SAAL flights could be linked to Loftleidir&#x27;s budget flights to North America. 

In 1967, S.A.A.L. joined IATA by which it was granted the serial number 70. The Dakotas and Skymasters were gradually withdrawn from the fleet, while the DC6-Bs were used for domestic and a few short-haul regional flights. 

The Six-Day War disrupted S.A.A.L&#x27;s operations for several weeks in 1967 and the airline had to suspend its flights to Jerusalem. Beyond these immediate consequences on the airline, Syria&#x27;s military defeat in 1967 left the whole country in a state of shock and had a decisive impact on the evolution of its political system for years to come. Nevertheless, S.A.A.L&#x27;s operations were gradually restored and a normal level of operation was recovered by 1968 as shown in the timetable below. The fleet consisted then of two Super Caravelles and three DC-6Bs.

===Syrian Air takes off: 1970–1980===
With the beginning of the seventies, S.A.A.L continued its steady development by introducing flights to Moscow in 1970 and purchasing another two Super Caravelles from Sterling Airways in June 1971. 

Frequencies were increased, and flights to Jeddah were resumed the same year while new flights were launched to Abu Dhabi, Benghazi and Budapest. Flights were disrupted for several weeks during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. 

A new airport, the Damascus International Airport, was built 25  km south-east of the capital and was opened to traffic in 1973 to become S.A.A.L&#x27;s modern hub, replacing the old Mezze structure inherited from the French mandate.

A climate of confidence, pragmatism and political stability was nevertheless in sight in Syria after decades of volatile politics and coups d&#x27;état. Ambitious development programs were launched throughout the country. 

Syrian Arab Airlines was among the government&#x27;s priorities as a new modernization and expansion program was launched. A new S.A.A.L. livery was introduced in 1973, featuring the airline&#x27;s new logo, a mythical bird rising over a Mediterranean-blue disk. 

Closer economic and political ties with the Warsaw Pact countries led to the progressive buildup of a comprehensive network in Eastern Europe, with the addition of Bucharest–Otopeni, Prague–Ruzyně and Berlin–Schoenefeld. More flights to North Africa were added in 1974 with the introduction of Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers and Casablanca. Sanaa was also added to the network in 1974. 

In parallel to that, S.A.A.L. was managing an increasing number of Soviet-built aircraft for the Syrian government and the Syrian Air Force. That fleet was gradually expanded to include two Antonov An-24s, six Antonov An-26s, six Yakovlev Yak-40s and four Ilyushin Il-76 freighters (2Il-76Ts, 2 Il76Ms), in addition to two French-built Dassault Mystere Falcon 20Fs and one Dassault Falcon 900. 

These aircraft were not used by the airline for scheduled services except for some of the Yak-40s which replaced the Douglas DC-6B and the Caravelles on domestic routes by the early eighties. In 1974, two Boeing 707s were leased in from British Airtours to complement the Caravelle fleet. That year, the airline carried 279,866 passengers.

A fleet renewal program was launched in 1975 as S.A.A.L. ordered three brand-new Boeing 727-294s and two Boeing 747SPs. Awaiting the delivery of its new planes, the airline leased Boeing 707s to improve its service offer. In all, two Boeing 707-420s and six Boeing 707-320s were leased in (respectively from British Airtours and British Midland Airways) at various times between 1974 and 1976 and were used to reinforce frequencies and add new destinations to the network. 

The &quot;SyrianAir&quot; styling was officially adopted on November 11, 1975, in anticipation of the delivery of the new Boeing fleet and to generate a more modern and international image. However, SyrianAir&#x27;s official and legal title continued to be &quot;Syrian Arab Airlines&quot;. 

The Boeing 727s supplemented the Caravelles throughout the network, while the Boeing 747SPs were used on high-load international routes (Munich, Paris, London, the Persian Gulf region, Karachi and Delhi). Demand was particularly high on these routes in 1976, especially following the repeated closures of the Beirut International Airport, and the increasing number of passengers using Damascus International Airport for travel to and from neighboring and war-stricken Lebanon. A record 480,000 passengers were carried by the airline in 1976. 

The two jumbo jets were ordered in 1976 to operate transatlantic services to New York City. SyrianAir and the Royal Jordanian Airlines were to join forces in launching the first transatlantic route ever operated by an Arab Middle Eastern airline. The joint flight agreement never really materialized, and Alia launched independently its own Amman-New York flights in 1977. SyrianAir started its Boeing 747SP operations on June 1, 1976, using the jumbo jet on the Damascus-Munich-London sector. 

During the seventies, SyrianAair managed to acquire a modern fleet, revamp its image and operate a profitable passenger network on three continents largely satisfying the needs of the Syrian market. Its fares were accessible and attracted budget travellers flying between Europe and South Asia. The climate of stability and economic prosperity in Syria had a determining influence on the positive results of the airline. The eighties brought about new challenges to both, Syria and its airline.

===Mixed fortunes, mixed-fleet carrier 1980–1993===

SyrianAir welcomed the eighties with an active fleet of three Boeing 727s, two Boeing 747SPs, and two ageing Super Caravelles. In 1980, SyrianAir sold the Caravelles as plans were made for the acquisition of newer aircraft. In 1981, the airline carried 510,000 passengers, but these numbers declined to 462,000 in 1982 following the unrest caused by the 1982 Lebanon War. The Yakovlev Yak 40s devoted to internal routes were mostly flown on behalf of the Syrian Air Force. 

While there was an obvious need to renew the fleet and increase the airline&#x27;s capacity, mounting tensions between Syria and the West hampered the airline&#x27;s modernization plans. There was a growing rift between the U.S. administration in particular and Syria; both parties found themselves often at odds regarding a variety of regional issues, from the Iranian revolution, the Palestinian cause, to the raging conflict in Lebanon and Iran-Iraq War. 

These tensions ultimately resulted in economic sanctions voted by the U.S Congress, which accused Syria of harbouring and embracing illegal opposition movements. The sanctions, which became effective in the early eighties, apart from harming Syria&#x27;s economy in general, prevented SyrianAir from buying newer Western equipment. This climate of difficult economics also resulted in a relatively austere on-board service and in the persistence of tedious multiple-leg routings, while competing airlines were offering nonstop frequent flights. 

SyrianAir had ultimately to resort to Soviet-built aircraft to expand its fleet. The Tupolev Tu-134s were introduced in 1983. In all, six Tu-134s were bought by SyrianAir, including two devoted to governmental missions. The Tu-134s were used along with the Caravelles on low-yield regional and medium-haul flights and some domestic routes, while most of the domestic flights continued to be operated using the Yakovlev Yak-40s. Three Tupolev Tu-154Ms were acquired by SyrianAir between 1984 and 1986, they provided a well-needed boost to the Boeing 727 operations in Europe and the Persian Gulf region. The same difficult summer of 1985, flights to Beirut were restarted using the Super Caravelles. 

In 1986, SyrianAir had to suspend flights to one of its long-standing and most important destinations, London, because of a diplomatic crisis between the UK and Syria following the Hindawi affair. The number of passengers carried by SyrianAir declined to 353,355 in 1988, the lowest since the mid-seventies, forcing the airline towards more reform. The workforce was reduced by 1.5% to 3,526 in 1989, the number of passengers carried that year increased to 509,659. The workforce was increased to 3,615 in 1990, and the number of passengers increased to 655,644, a record despite the war in Kuwait, and the airline was able to finish the year without losses.

While sanctions and harsh economics kept it lagging way behind its competitors, and while the demise of the Soviet Union cast doubts on the future of its Tupolev fleet, SyrianAir&#x27;s fortunes changed following the Gulf War in 1990. As Syria supported the U.S.-led coalition against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, it regained some of its long-lost sympathy in Western hearts. Flights to London were resumed in 1991, and passenger numbers continued to increase to 700,819. The long-standing U.S. sanctions were eased in 1993, allowing the acquisition of modern Western equipment.

===Renewal and modernization 1994–present===


In 1994, Kuwait donated to Syria three Boeing 727-269s which enabled SyrianAir to finally phase out the two Caravelles in December of the following year. In 1995, a record 71 million dollars in operating profit was reported by the airline. The Tupolev operations were gradually scaled down, while new destinations (Madrid and Stockholm) were launched. In 1997, the airline took drastic measures in reducing its workforce to 2,331, as operating profits had declined to 44 million USD during the previous year. 

By 1998, the Tupolev Tu-134 was restricted to the Budapest, Beirut, Kuwait, Deir ez-Zor and Qamishly sectors while the Tu-154s were still flown to Bucharest, Moscow, Istanbul, Cairo and Aleppo. In October 1998, SyrianAir received its first Airbus A320-232, YK-AKA and a new livery was unveiled for the occasion. Six Airbus A320s were delivered to SyrianAir in all, allowing the withdrawal of the Tupolevs from regular service by 2000. The Tupolev Tu-134 (except for YK-AYE, YK-AYB and YK-AYF maintained for government use) as well as the Caravelles were stored by the airline at Damascus International Airport. In 1999, flights between Aleppo and Beirut were inaugurated (no such flights had been carried out since the sixties) and service to Libya was resumed following the removal of the UN sanctions against that country.

In 2000, SyrianAir operated a fleet of 14 aircraft: six Airbus A320s, six Boeing 727s and two Boeing 747SPs, while it continued to use the Syrian Air Force Yakovlev Yak-40s for the domestic routes to Qamishly and Deirezzor. Flights to Vienna were inaugurated, while the resumption of Amman and Baghdad flights during that year would prove only temporary. According to the Syrian DGCA website, the airline carried 764,000 passengers that year. In 2003, the airline registered a 9 million dollar net profit thanks to its more economical fleet and carried 907,850 passengers. Unprofitable routes were either scrapped or downscaled for seasonal operations. Thus, flights to Teheran, Bahrain, Doha and Muscat were operated only during the summer season. New markets were sought with the addition of Milan, Barcelona, Manchester, Copenhagen and Benghazi in 2004. 

With a workforce exceeding 4,000 employees, SyrianAir, whose revenues nevertheless exceeded 171 million dollars in 2003, remains over-staffed. In 2004, and despite a difficult regional situation and U.S. sanctions, the airline improved its performance, carrying 1.07 million passengers. Syrian air carried close to 1.4 million passengers by 2005, however, the number of passengers being carried declined to less than 740,000 passengers by 2009. 

Plans were made for the renewal of the fleet with the possible acquisition of several new Airbus aircraft to replace the ageing Boeing 727 and 747s. These plans were hampered by the reinforcement of a U.S.-led embargo against Syria after the start of the conflict in Syria in 2011, and fleet renewal using Russian equipment was being reconsidered.

By 2012, Syrian Air had retired all its old Boeing 747, 727 and Tupolev aircraft, leaving SyrianAir with just 8 aircraft in its fleet - 2 ATRs and 6 Airbus A320s. In 2017, the company acquired an Airbus A340-300 (YK-AZA, YK-AZB) despite sanctions.

On 9 January 2020, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad issued a legislative decree to change the name from Syrian Arab Airlines to Syrian Airlines. Two more Airbus A-320-200 were delivered via Iran in July and December 2022 (reg. YK-AKG, YK-AKH).

===EU and US sanctions===
On 23 July 2012, as the Syrian Civil War continued, the European Union imposed a new wave of sanctions on Syria, which included sanctions on SyrianAir. The sanctions meant that the airline could not conduct flights to the EU, or buy any new aircraft which contained European parts. As a result, Syrian Air was forced to suspend all its operations in the EU. The company is discussing a lawsuit against European Union countries since Syrian Airlines &quot;did not violate any laws nor did it jeopardise safety&quot;. However EU ministers justified the sanctions on the airline because the company &quot;provides financial and logistical support for the Syrian government&quot;

On 10 October 2012, a Syrian Air flight in Turkish airspace was flanked by two fighter jets and forced to land in the country. It was believed the plane was carrying a Russian shipment to the Syrian military. Turkey&#x27;s then-Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu said that Turkey had &quot;received information this plane was carrying cargo of a nature that could not possibly comply with the rules of civil aviation.&quot; Russian news agency Interfax cited an unnamed source from a Russian arms exporting agency who stated that there were no weapons or military equipment on board the plane.

===Fleet development===
The company cannot purchase any new Airbus or Boeing planes, unless the United States and European Union lift the sanctions imposed on it. SyrianAir has maintained orders for new Tupolev, Ilyushin, and Antonov aircraft. However, an order for 10 Antonov-158 has been cancelled due to the Syrian Civil War.

In November 2018, it was reported the airline is evaluating placing an order for 15-20 Irkut MC-21-300s, which it would be able to add despite US and European sanctions. If an order is placed, deliveries could commence in 2024.

<text>The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in May 1707 following the ratification of the Acts of Union by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The Acts ratified the treaty of Union which created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and created the parliament of Great Britain located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This lasted nearly a century, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom with effect from 1 January 1801.

==History==
Following the Treaty of Union in 1706, Acts of Union ratifying the Treaty were passed in both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland, which created a new Kingdom of Great Britain. The Acts paved the way for the enactment of the treaty of Union which created a new parliament, referred to as the &#x27;Parliament of Great Britain&#x27;, based in the home of the former English parliament. All of the traditions, procedures, and standing orders of the English parliament were retained, although there is no provision for this within the treaty; furthermore, the incumbent officers and members representing England comprised the overwhelming majority of the new body. It was not even considered necessary to hold a new general election. While Scots law and Scottish legislation remained separate, new legislation was thereafter to be enacted by the new parliament, with the exception of that pertaining to private right which could only legislated on for the &quot;evident utility&quot; of the people. England&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; prominence in the new parliament was, and remains, a contentious issue.

After the Hanoverian King George I ascended the British throne in 1714 through the Act of Settlement of 1701, real power continued to shift away from the monarchy. George was a German ruler, spoke poor English, and remained interested in governing his dominions in continental Europe rather than in Britain. He thus entrusted power to a group of his ministers, the foremost of whom was Sir Robert Walpole, and by the end of his reign in 1727 the position of the ministers – who had to rely on Parliament for support – was cemented. George I&#x27;s successor, his son George II, continued to follow through with his father&#x27;s domestic policies and made little effort to re-establish monarchical control over the government which was now in firm control by Parliament. By the end of the 18th century the monarch still had considerable influence over Parliament, which was dominated by the English aristocracy, by means of patronage, but had ceased to exert direct power: for instance, the last occasion on which royal assent was withheld was in 1708 by Queen Anne, even this being done only at the request of her ministers. At general elections the vote was restricted to freeholders and landowners, in constituencies that had changed little since the Middle Ages, so that in many &quot;rotten&quot; and &quot;pocket&quot; boroughs seats could be bought, while major cities remained unrepresented, except by the Knights of the Shire representing whole counties. Reformers and Radicals sought parliamentary reform, but as the French Revolutionary Wars developed the British government became repressive against dissent and progress towards reform was stalled.

George II&#x27;s successor, George III, sought to restore royal supremacy and absolute monarchy, but by the end of his reign the position of the king&#x27;s ministers – who discovered that they needed the support of Parliament to enact any major changes – had become central to the role of British governance, and would remain so ever after.

During the first half of George III&#x27;s reign, the monarch still had considerable influence over Parliament, which itself was dominated by the patronage and influence of the English nobility. Most candidates for the House of Commons were identified as Whigs or Tories, but once elected they formed shifting coalitions of interests rather than dividing along clear party lines. At general elections the vote was restricted in most places to property owners, in constituencies which were out of date and did not reflect the growing importance of manufacturing towns or shifts of population, so that in the rotten and pocket boroughs seats in parliament could be bought from the rich landowners who controlled them, while major cities remained unrepresented. Reformers like William Beckford and Radicals beginning with John Wilkes called for reform of the system. In 1780, a draft programme of reform was drawn up by Charles James Fox and Thomas Brand Hollis and put forward by a sub-committee of the electors of Westminster. This included calls for the six points later adopted by the Chartists.

The American War of Independence ended in defeat for a foreign policy that sought to prevent the thirteen American colonies from breaking away and forming their own independent nation, something which George III had fervently advocated, and in March 1782 the king was forced to appoint an administration led by his opponents which sought to curb royal patronage. In November of 1783, he took the opportunity to use his influence in the House of Lords to defeat a bill to reform the Honourable East India Company, dismissed the government of the day, and appointed William Pitt the Younger to form a new government. Pitt had previously called for Parliament to begin to reform itself, but he did not press for long for reforms the king did not like. Proposals Pitt made in April 1785 to redistribute seats from the &quot;rotten boroughs&quot; to London and the counties were defeated in the House of Commons by 248 votes to 174.

In the wake of the French Revolution of 1789, Radical organisations such as the London Corresponding Society sprang up to press for parliamentary reform, but as the French Revolutionary Wars developed the government took extensive repressive measures against feared domestic unrest aping the democratic and egalitarian ideals of the French Revolution and progress toward reform was stalled for decades.

=== Parliament of the United Kingdom ===
In 1801, the Parliament of the United Kingdom was created when the Kingdom of Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the Acts of Union 1800.

==Membership by constituent country==
Monmouthshire (One County constituency with two members and one single member Borough constituency) is included in Wales in these tables. Sources for this period may include the county in England.

<text>The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England from the 13th century until 1707 when it was replaced by the Parliament of Great Britain. Parliament evolved from the great council of bishops and peers that advised the English monarch. Great councils were first called Parliaments during the reign of Henry III (). By this time, the king required Parliament&#x27;s consent to levy taxation. 

Originally a unicameral body, a bicameral Parliament emerged when its membership was divided into the House of Lords and House of Commons, which included knights of the shire and burgesses. During Henry IV&#x27;s time on the throne, the role of Parliament expanded beyond the determination of taxation policy to include the &quot;redress of grievances&quot;, which essentially enabled English citizens to petition the body to address complaints in their local towns and counties. By this time, citizens were given the power to vote to elect their representatives—the burgesses—to the House of Commons.

Over the centuries, the English Parliament progressively limited the power of the English monarchy, a process that arguably culminated in the English Civil War and the High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I.

== Predecessors (pre-13th century) ==
Parliament&#x27;s origins stretch back to the 10th century when the first kings of England convened assemblies of the witan or (the magnates and clergy). They occurred regularly at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsun, allowing kings to maintain ties with powerful men in distant regions of the country. These assemblies helped produce Anglo-Saxon law codes and decide major political questions, like war and peace. The witan conducted state trials, such as the trial of Earl Godwin in 1051. While not an elected body, the witan spoke for all English people through virtual representation. On behalf of the English nation, the witan negotiated with Aethelred the Unready () and Cnut the Great (), recognising them as kings.

After the Norman Conquest of 1066, the king received regular counsel from the members of his (Latin for ) and periodically enlarged the court by summoning a (Latin for ) to discuss national business and promulgate legislation. For example, the Domesday survey was planned at the Christmas council of 1085, and the Constitutions of Clarendon were made at the 1164 council. The continued to be the setting of state trials, such as the trial of Thomas Becket.

The members of the great councils were the king&#x27;s tenants-in-chief. The greater tenants (archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and barons) were summoned by individual writ, but lesser tenants were summoned by sheriffs. These were not representative or democratic assemblies. They were feudal councils in which barons fulfilled their obligation to provide counsel to their lord the king. Councils allowed kings to consult with their leading subjects, but such consultation rarely resulted in a change in royal policy. According to historian Judith Green, &quot;these assemblies were more concerned with ratification and publicity than with debate&quot;. In addition, the had no role in approving taxation as the king could levy geld (discontinued after 1162) whenever he wished.

The years between 1189 and 1215 were a time of transition for the great council. The cause of this transition were new financial burdens imposed by the Crown to finance the Third Crusade, ransom Richard I, and pay for the series of Anglo-French wars fought between the Plantagenet and Capetian dynasties. In 1188, a precedent was established when the great council granted Henry II the Saladin tithe. In granting this tax, the great council was acting as representatives for all taxpayers.

The likelihood of resistance to national taxes made consent politically necessary. It was convenient for kings to present the great council as a representative body capable of consenting on behalf of all within the kingdom. Increasingly, the kingdom was described as the (Latin for ) and the barons as their natural representatives. But this development also created more conflict between kings and the baronage as the latter attempted to defend what they considered the rights belonging to the king&#x27;s subjects.

King John () alienated the barons by his partiality in dispensing justice, heavy financial demands and abusing his right to feudal incidents, reliefs, and aids. In 1215, the barons forced John to abide by a charter of liberties similar to charters issued by earlier kings . Known as Magna Carta (Latin for ), it was based on three assumptions important to the later development of Parliament:
# the king was subject to the law
# the king could only make law and raise taxation (except customary feudal dues) with the consent of the community of the realm
# that the obedience owed by subjects to the king was conditional and not absolute

Clause 12 stated that certain taxes could only be levied &quot;through the common counsel of our kingdom&quot;, and clause 14 specified that this common counsel was to come from bishops, earls, and barons. While the clause stipulating no taxation &quot;without the common counsel&quot; was deleted from later reissues, it was nevertheless adhered to by later kings. Magna Carta would gain the status of fundamental law after John&#x27;s reign.

== 13th century ==
The word &quot;parliament&quot; comes from the French first used in the late 11th century, meaning or . In the mid-1230s, it became a common name for meetings of the great council. The word was first used with this meaning in 1236.

In the 13th century, parliaments were developing throughout north-western Europe. As a vassal to the King of France, English kings were suitors to the Parlement of Paris. In the 13th century, the French and English parliaments were similar in their functions; however, the two institutions diverged in significant ways in later centuries.

After the 1230s, the normal meeting place for Parliament was fixed at Westminster. Parliaments tended to meet according to the legal year so that the courts were also in session: January or February for the Hilary term, in April or May for the Easter term, in July, and in October for the Michaelmas term.

=== Attendance ===
Most parliaments had between forty and eighty attendees. They brought together social classes resembling the estates of the realm of continental Europe: the landed aristocracy (barons and knights), the clergy, and the towns. Historian John Maddicott points out that &quot;the main division within parliament was less between lords and commons than between the landed and all others, lower clergy as well as burgesses&quot;. Meetings of Parliament always included:

* the king
* chief ministers and other ministers (great officers of state, justices of the King&#x27;s Bench and Common Bench, and barons of the exchequer)
* members of the king&#x27;s council
* ecclesiastical magnates (archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors)
* lay magnates (earls and barons)

The lower clergy (deans, cathedral priors, archdeacons, parish priests) were occasionally summoned when papal taxation was on the agenda. Beginning around the 1220s, the concept of representation, summarised in the Roman law maxim (Latin for ), gained new importance among the clergy, and they began choosing proctors to represent them at church assemblies and, when summoned, at Parliament.

As feudalism declined and the gentry and merchant classes increased in influence, the shires and boroughs were recognised as communes (Latin ) with a unified constituency capable of being represented by knights of the shire and burgesses. Initially, knights and burgesses were summoned only when new taxes were proposed so that representatives of the communes (or the Commons) could report back home that taxes were lawfully granted. The Commons were not regularly summoned until the 1290s, after the so-called Model Parliament of 1295. Of the thirty parliaments between 1274 and 1294, knights only attended four and burgesses only two. 

Specialists could be summoned to Parliament to provide expert advice. For example, Roman law experts were summoned from Cambridge and Oxford to the Norham parliament of 1291 to advise on the disputed Scottish succession. At the Bury St Edmunds parliament of 1296, burgesses &quot;who best know how to plan and lay out a certain new town&quot; were summoned to advise on the rebuilding of Berwick after its capture by the English.

=== Early functions and powers ===

Parliament—or the &quot;High Court of Parliament&quot; as it became known—was England&#x27;s highest court of justice. A large amount of its business involved judicial questions referred to it by ministers, judges, and other government officials. Many petitions were submitted to Parliament by individuals whose grievances were not satisfied through normal administrative or judicial channels. As the number of petitions increased, they came to be directed to particular departments (chancery, exchequer, the courts) leaving the king&#x27;s council to concentrate on the most important business. Parliament became &quot;a delivery point and a sorting house for petitions&quot;. From 1290 to 1307, Gilbert of Rothbury was placed in charge of organising parliamentary business and record-keeping—in effect a clerk of the parliaments.

Kings could legislate outside of Parliament through legislative (administrative orders drafted by the king&#x27;s council as letters patent or letters close) and writs drafted by the chancery in response to particular court cases. But kings could also use Parliament to promulgate legislation. Parliament&#x27;s legislative role was largely passive—the actual work of law-making was done by the king and council, specifically the judges on the council who drafted statutes. Completed legislation was then presented to Parliament for ratification.

Kings needed Parliament to fund their military campaigns. On the basis of Magna Carta, Parliament asserted for itself the right to consent to taxation, and a pattern developed in which the king would make concessions (such as reaffirming liberties in Magna Carta) in return for tax grants. Withholding taxation was Parliament&#x27;s main tool in disputes with the king. Nevertheless, the king was still able to raise lesser amounts of revenue from sources that did not require parliamentary consent, such as:

* county farms (the fixed sum paid annually by sheriffs for the privilege of administering and profiting from royal lands in their counties)
* profits from the eyre
* tallage on the royal demesne, the towns, foreign merchants, and most importantly English Jews
* scutage
* feudal dues and fines
* profits from wardship, escheat, and vacant episcopal sees

=== Henry III ===
Henry III (r. 1216–1272) became king at nine years old after his father, King John, died during the First Barons&#x27; War. During the king&#x27;s minority, England was ruled by a regency government that relied heavily on great councils to legitimise its actions. Great councils even consented to the appointment of royal ministers, an action that normally was considered a royal prerogative. Historian John Maddicott writes that the &quot;effect of the minority was thus to make the great council an indispensable part of the country&#x27;s government [and] to give it a degree of independent initiative and authority which central assemblies had never previously possessed&quot;.

The regency government officially ended when Henry turned sixteen in 1223, and the magnates demanded the adult king confirm previous grants of Magna Carta made in 1216 and 1217 to ensure their legality. At the same time, the king needed money to defend his possessions in Poitou and Gascony from a French invasion. At a great council in 1225, a deal was reached that saw Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest reissued in return for a fifteenth (7 percent) tax on movable property. This set a precedent that taxation was granted in return for the redress of grievances.

==== Ministers and finances ====
In 1232, Peter des Roches became the king&#x27;s chief minister. His nephew, Peter de Rivaux, accumulated a large number of offices, including lord keeper of the privy seal and keeper of the wardrobe; yet, these appointments were not approved by the magnates as had become customary during the regency government. Under Roches, the government revived practices used during King John&#x27;s reign and that had been condemned in Magna Carta, such as arbitrary disseisins, revoking perpetual rights granted in royal charters, depriving heirs of their inheritances, and marrying heiresses to foreigners.

Both Roches and Rivaux were foreigners from Poitou. The rise of a royal administration controlled by foreigners and dependent solely on the king stirred resentment among the magnates, who felt excluded from power. Several barons rose in rebellion, and the bishops intervened to persuade the king to change ministers. At a great council in April 1234, the king agreed to remove Rivaux and other ministers. This was the first occasion in which a king was forced to change his ministers by a great council or parliament. The struggle between king and Parliament over ministers became a permanent feature of English politics.

Thereafter, the king ruled in concert with an active Parliament, which considered matters related to foreign policy, taxation, justice, administration, and legislation. January 1236 saw the passage of the Statute of Merton, the first English statute. Among other things, the law continued barring bastards from inheritance. Significantly, the language of the preamble describes the legislation as &quot;provided&quot; by the magnates and &quot;conceded&quot; by the king, which implies that this was not simply a royal measure consented to by the barons. In 1237, Henry asked Parliament for a tax to fund his sister Isabella&#x27;s dowry. The barons were unenthusiastic, but they granted the funds in return for the king&#x27;s promise to reconfirm Magna Carta, add three magnates to his personal council, limit the royal prerogative of purveyance, and protect land tenure rights.

But Henry was adamant that three concerns were exclusively within his royal prerogative: family and inheritance matters, patronage, and appointments. Important decisions were made without consulting Parliament, such as in 1254 when the king accepted the throne of the Kingdom of Sicily for his younger son, Edmund Crouchback. He also clashed with Parliament over appointments to the three great offices of chancellor, justiciar, and treasurer. The barons believed these three offices should be restraints on royal misgovernment, but the king promoted minor officials within the royal household who owed their loyalty exclusively to him.

In 1253, while fighting in Gascony, Henry requested men and money to resist an anticipated attack from Alfonso X of Castile. In a January 1254 Parliament, the bishops themselves promised an aid but would not commit the rest of the clergy. Likewise, the barons promised to assist the king if he was attacked but would not commit the rest of the laity to pay money. For this reason, the lower clergy of each diocese elected proctors at church synods, and each county elected two knights of the shire. These representatives were summoned to Parliament in April 1254 to consent to taxation. The men elected as shire knights were prominent landholders with experience in local government and as soldiers. They were elected by barons, other knights, and probably freeholders of sufficient standing.

==== Baronial reform movement ====
By 1258, the relationship between the king and the baronage had reached a breaking point over the Sicilian business, in which Henry had promised to pay papal debts in return for the pope&#x27;s help securing the Sicilian crown for his son, Edmund. At the Oxford Parliament of 1258, reform-minded barons forced a reluctant king to accept a constitutional framework known as the Provisions of Oxford:

* The king was to govern according to the advice of an elected council of fifteen barons.
* The baronial council appointed royal ministers (justiciar, treasurer, chancellor) to serve for one-year terms.
* Parliament met three times a year on the octave of Michaelmas (October 6), Candlemas (February 3), and June 1.
* The barons elected twelve representatives (two bishops, one earl and nine barons) who together with the baronial council could act on legislation and other matters even when Parliament was not in session as &quot;a kind of standing parliamentary committee&quot;.

Parliament now met regularly according to a schedule rather than at the pleasure of the king. The reformers hoped that the provisions would ensure parliamentary approval for all major government acts. Under the provisions, Parliament was &quot;established formally (and no longer merely by custom) as the voice of the community&quot;.

The theme of reform dominated later parliaments. During the Michaelmas Parliament of 1258, the Ordinance of Sheriffs was issued as letters patent that forbade sheriffs from taking bribes. At the Candlemas Parliament of 1259, the baronial council and the twelve representatives enacted the Ordinance of the Magnates. In this ordinance, the barons promised to observe Magna Carta and other reforming legislation. They also required their own bailiffs to observe similar rules as those of royal sheriffs, and the justiciar was given power to correct abuses of their officials. The Michaelmas Parliament of 1259 enacted the Provisions of Westminster, a set of legal and administrative reforms designed to address grievances of freeholders and even villeins, such as abuses related to the murdrum fine.

Henry III made his first move against the baronial reformers while in France negotiating peace with Louis IX. Using the excuse of his absence from the realm and Welsh attacks in the marches, Henry ordered the justiciar, Hugh Bigod, to postpone the parliament scheduled for Candlemas 1260. This was an apparent violation of the Provisions of Oxford; however, the provisions were silent on what should happen if the king were outside the kingdom. The king&#x27;s motive was to prevent the promulgation of further reforms through Parliament. Simon de Montfort, a leader of the baronial reformers, ignored these orders and made plans to hold a parliament in London but was prevented by Bigod. When the king arrived back in England he summoned a parliament which met in July, where Montfort was brought to trial though ultimately cleared of wrongdoing.

In April 1261, the pope released the king from his oath to adhere to the Provisions of Oxford, and Henry publicly renounced the Provisions in May. Most of the barons were willing to let the king reassume power provided he ruled well. By 1262, Henry had regained all of his authority, and Montfort left England. The barons were now divided mainly by age. The elder barons remained loyal to the king, but younger barons coalesced around Montfort, who returned to England in the spring of 1263.

==== Montfortian parliaments ====
The royalist barons and rebel barons fought each other in the Second Barons&#x27; War. Montfort defeated the king at the Battle of Lewes in 1264 and became the real ruler of England for the next twelve months. Montfort held a parliament in June 1264 to sanction a new form of government and rally support. This parliament was notable for including knights of the shire who were expected to deliberate fully on political matters, not just assent to taxation.

The June Parliament approved a new constitution in which the king&#x27;s powers were given to a council of nine. The new council was chosen and led by three electors (Montfort, Stephen Bersted, bishop of Chichester, and Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester). The electors could replace any of the nine as they saw fit, but the electors themselves could only be removed by Parliament.

Montfort held two other Parliaments during his time in power. The most famous—Simon de Montfort&#x27;s Parliament—was held in January 1265 amidst threat of a French invasion and unrest throughout the realm. For the first time, burgesses (elected by those residents of boroughs or towns who held burgage tenure, such as wealthy merchants or craftsmen) were summoned along with knights of the shire.

Montfort was killed at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, and Henry was restored to power. In August 1266, Parliament authorised the Dictum of Kenilworth, which nullified everything Montfort had done and removed all restraints on the king. In 1267, some of the reforms contained in the 1259 Provisions of Westminster were revised in the form of the Statute of Marlborough passed in 1267. This was the start of a process of statutory reform that continued into the reign of Henry&#x27;s successor.

=== Edward I ===

Edward I () learned from the failures of his father&#x27;s reign the usefulness of Parliament for building consensus and strengthening royal authority. Parliaments were held regularly throughout his reign, generally twice a year at Easter in the spring and after Michaelmas in the autumn.

Under Edward, the first major statutes amending the common law were promulgated in Parliament:

* Statute of Westminster I (1275)
* Statute of Gloucester (1278)
* Statute of Mortmain (1279)
* Statute of Westminster II (1285)
* Statute of Winchester (1285)
* Statute &quot;Quia Emptores&quot; (1290)
* Statute &quot;Quo Warranto&quot; (1290)

The first Statute of Westminster required free elections without intimidation. This act was accompanied by the grant of a tax on England&#x27;s wealthy wool trade—a half-mark (6s 8d) on each sack of wool exported. It became known as the (Latin: ) and was granted to Edward and his heirs, becoming part of the Crown&#x27;s permanent revenue until the 17th century.

==== Model Parliament of 1295 ====
In 1294, PhilipIV of France attempted to recover Aquitaine in the Gascon War. Edward&#x27;s need for money to finance the war led him to take arbitrary measures. He ordered the seizure of merchants&#x27; wool, which was only released after payment of the unpopular maltolt, a tax never authorised by Parliament. Church wealth was arbitrarily seized, and the clergy were further asked to give half of their revenues to the king. They refused but agreed to a smaller sum. Over the next couple years, parliaments approved new taxes, but it was never enough. More money was needed to put down a Welsh rebellion and win the First War of Scottish Independence.

This need for money led to what became known as the Model Parliament of November 1295. In addition to the earls and barons summoned individually, sheriffs were instructed to send two elected knights from each shire and two elected burgesses from each borough. The Commons had been summoned to earlier parliaments but only with power to consent to what the magnates decided. In the Model Parliament, the writ of summons invested shire knights and burgesses with power to provide both counsel and consent.

==== Crisis of 1297 ====
By 1296, the King&#x27;s efforts to recover Gascony were creating resentment among the clergy, merchants, and magnates. At the Bury St Edmunds parliament in 1296, the lay magnates and Commons agreed to pay a tax on moveable property. The clergy refused, citing the recent papal bull , forbidding secular rulers from taxing the church without papal permission. In January 1297, a convocation of the clergy met at St Paul&#x27;s in London to consider the matter further but ultimately could find no way to pay the tax without violating the papal bull. In retaliation, the King outlawed the clergy and confiscated clerical property on 30 January. On 10 February, Robert Winchelsey, archbishop of Canterbury, responded by excommunicating anyone acting against . Some clergy paid a fine for the restoration of their property that was identical to the tax requested by the King.

At the Salisbury parliament of March 1297, Edward unveiled his plans for recovering Gascony. The English would mount a two-front attack with the King leading an expedition to Flanders while other barons traveled to Gascony. This plan faced opposition from the most important noblemen—Roger Bigod, marshal and earl of Norfolk, and Humphrey Bohun, constable and earl of Hereford. Norfolk and Hereford argued that they owed the king military service in foreign lands but only if the king were present. Therefore, they would not go to Gascony unless the King went as well. Norfolk and Hereford were supported by around 30 barons, and the parliament ended without any decision. After the Salisbury parliament ended, Edward ordered the seizure of wool and payment of a new maltolt.

In July 1297, a writ declared that &quot;the earls, barons, knights, and other laity of our realm&quot; had granted a tax on moveables. In reality, this grant was not made by a parliament but by an informal gathering &quot;standing around in [the king&#x27;s] chamber&quot;. Norfolk and Hereford drew up a list of grievances known as the Remonstrances, which criticized the king&#x27;s demand for military service and heavy taxes. The maltolt and prises were particularly objectionable due to their arbitrary nature. 

Edward pledged to make amends for the people&#x27;s grievances once he returned from campaign in Flanders. However, most knights ordered to join the campaign stayed home, and the King set sail with only a hundred knights. Prior to Edward&#x27;s departure, Norfolk and Hereford protested at the exchequer that the irregular tax &quot;was never granted by them or the community&quot; and declared they would not pay it. Edward authorised the tax&#x27;s collection but promised it would not be treated as a precedent. Edward set sail and left behind a country on the brink of civil war.

The outbreak of the First War of Scottish Independence necessitated that both the king and his opponents put aside their differences. At the October 1297 parliament, the council agreed to concessions in the king&#x27;s absence. In exchange for a new tax, the reconfirmed Magna Carta, abolished the maltolt, and formally recognised that &quot;aids, , and prises&quot; needed the consent of Parliament.

==== Later reign ====
Edward soon broke the agreements of 1297, and his relations with Parliament remained strained for the rest of his reign as he sought further funds for the war in Scotland. At the parliament of March 1300, the king was forced to agree to the , which gave further concessions to his subjects.

At the Lincoln parliament of 1301, the King heard complaints that the charters were not followed and calls for the dismissal of his chief minister, the treasurer Walter Langton. Demands for appointment of ministers by &quot;common consent&quot; were heard for the first time since Henry III&#x27;s death. To this, Edward angrily refused, saying that every other magnate in England had the power &quot;to arrange his household, to appoint bailiffs and stewards&quot; without outside interference. He did offer to right any wrongs his officials had committed. Notably, the petition on behalf of &quot;the prelates and leading men of the kingdom acting for the whole community&quot; was presented by Henry de Keighley, knight for Lanchashire. This indicates that knights were holding greater weight in Parliament.

The last four parliaments of Edward&#x27;s&#x27; reign were less contentious. With Scotland nearly conquered, royal finances improved and opposition to royal policies decreased. A number of petitions were considered at the parliament of February 1305 included ones related to crime. In response, Edward issued the trailbaston ordinance. The state trial of Nicholas Seagrave was conducted as part of this parliament as well. Harmonious relations continued between king and Parliament even after December 1305 when Pope Clement V absolved the King of his oath to adhere to . The last parliament of the reign was held at Carlisle in 1307. It approved the marriage of the King&#x27;s son to Isabella of France. Legislation attacking papal provisions and papal taxation was also ratified.

== 14th century ==

=== Edward II (1307–1327) ===
One of the moments that marked the emergence of parliament as a true institution in England was the deposition of Edward II in January 1327. Even though it is debatable whether Edward II was deposed &quot;in&quot; parliament or &quot;by&quot; parliament, this remarkable sequence of events consolidated the importance of parliament in the English unwritten constitution. Parliament was also crucial in establishing the legitimacy of the king who replaced Edward II: his son Edward III.

=== Edward III (1327–1377) ===
In 1341 the Commons met separately from the nobility and clergy for the first time, creating what was effectively an Upper Chamber and a Lower Chamber, with the knights and burgesses sitting in the latter. This Upper Chamber became known as the House of Lords from 1544 onward, and the Lower Chamber became known as the House of Commons, collectively known as the Houses of Parliament.

The authority of parliament grew under Edward III; it was established that no law could be made, nor any tax levied, without the consent of both Houses and the Sovereign. This development occurred during the reign of Edward III because he was involved in the Hundred Years&#x27; War and needed finances. During his conduct of the war, Edward tried to circumvent parliament as much as possible, which caused this power structure to emerge.

The Commons came to act with increasing boldness during this period. During the Good Parliament of 1376, the Presiding Officer of the lower chamber, Peter de la Mare, complained of heavy taxes, demanded an accounting of the royal expenditures, and criticised the king&#x27;s management of the military. The Commons even proceeded to impeach some of the king&#x27;s ministers. The bold Speaker was imprisoned, but was soon released after the death of Edward III.

=== Richard II (1377–1399) ===
During the reign of the next monarch, Richard II, the Commons once again began to impeach errant ministers of the Crown. They insisted that they could control not only taxation but also public expenditure. Despite such gains in authority, however, the Commons still remained much less powerful than the House of Lords and the Crown.

== 15th century ==
This period saw the introduction of a franchise which limited the number of people who could vote in elections to the House of Commons. From 1430 onwards, the franchise for the election of knights of the shires in the county constituencies was limited to forty-shilling freeholders, meaning men who owned freehold property worth forty shillings (two pounds) or more. The Parliament of England legislated for this new uniform county franchise in the statute 8 Hen. 6. c. 7. The &quot;Chronological Table of the Statutes&quot; does not mention such a 1430 law, as it was included in the Consolidated Statutes as a recital in the Electors of Knights of the Shire Act 1432 (10 Hen. 6. c. 2), which amended and re-enacted the 1430 law to make clear that the resident of a county had to have a forty shilling freehold in that county to be a voter there.

== Tudor era (1485–1603) ==
During the reign of the Tudor monarchs, it is often argued that the modern structure of the English Parliament began to be created. The Tudor monarchy, according to historian J. E. Neale, was powerful, and there were often periods of several years when parliament did not sit at all. However, the Tudor monarchs realised that they needed parliament to legitimise many of their decisions, mostly out of a need to raise money through taxation legitimately without causing discontent. Thus they consolidated the state of affairs whereby monarchs would call and close parliament as and when they needed it. However, if monarchs did not call Parliament for several years, it is clear the Monarch did not require Parliament except to perhaps strengthen and provide a mandate for their reforms to Religion which had always been a matter within the Crown&#x27;s prerogative but would require the consent of the Bishopric and Commons.

By the time of the Tudor monarch Henry VII&#x27;s 1485 coronation, the monarch was not a member of either the Upper Chamber or the Lower Chamber. Consequently, the monarch would have to make his or her feelings known to Parliament through his or her supporters in both houses. Proceedings were regulated by the presiding officer in either chamber.

From the 1540s the presiding officer in the House of Commons became formally known as the &quot;Speaker&quot;, having previously been referred to as the &quot;prolocutor&quot; or &quot;parlour&quot; (a semi-official position, often nominated by the monarch, that had existed ever since Peter de Montfort had acted as the presiding officer of the Oxford Parliament of 1258). This was not an enviable job. When the House of Commons was unhappy it was the Speaker who had to deliver this news to the monarch. This began the tradition whereby the Speaker of the House of Commons is dragged to the Speaker&#x27;s Chair by other members once elected.

A member of either chamber could present a bill to parliament. Bills supported by the monarch were often proposed by members of the Privy Council who sat in parliament. For a bill to become law it would have to be approved by a majority of both Houses of Parliament before it passed to the monarch for royal assent or veto. The royal veto was applied several times during the 16th and 17th centuries and it is still the right of the monarch of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms to veto legislation today, although it has not been exercised since 1707 (today such an exercise might precipitate some form of constitutional crisis).

When a bill was enacted into law, this process gave it the approval of each estate of the realm: the King, Lords and Commons. The Parliament of England was far from being a democratically representative institution in this period. It was possible to assemble the entire peerage and senior clergy of the realm in one place to form the estate of the Upper Chamber. 

The voting franchise for the House of Commons was small; some historians estimate that it was as little as three per cent of the adult male population; and there was no secret ballot. Elections could therefore be controlled by local grandees, because in many boroughs a majority of voters were in some way dependent on a powerful individual, or else could be bought by money or concessions. If these grandees were supporters of the incumbent monarch, this gave the monarch and their ministers considerable influence over the business of parliament.

Many of the men elected to parliament did not relish the prospect of having to act in the interests of others. So a law was enacted, still on the statute book today, whereby it became unlawful for members of the House of Commons to resign their seat unless they were granted a position directly within the patronage of the monarchy (today this latter restriction leads to a legal fiction allowing &quot;de facto&quot; resignation despite the prohibition, but nevertheless it is a resignation which needs the permission of the Crown). However, while several elections to parliament in this period would be considered corrupt by modern standards, many elections involved genuine contests between rival candidates, even though the ballot was not secret.

===Establishment of permanent seat===
It was in this period that the Palace of Westminster was established as the seat of the English Parliament. In 1548, the House of Commons was granted a regular meeting place by the Crown, St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel. This had been a royal chapel. It was made into a debating chamber after Henry VIII became the last monarch to use the Palace of Westminster as a place of residence and after the suppression of the college there.

This room was the home of the House of Commons until it was destroyed by fire in 1834, although the interior was altered several times up until then. The structure of this room was pivotal in the development of the Parliament of England. While most modern legislatures sit in a circular chamber, the benches of the British Houses of Parliament are laid out in the form of choir stalls in a chapel, simply because this is the part of the original room that the members of the House of Commons used when they were granted use of St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel.

This structure took on a new significance with the emergence of political parties in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, as the tradition began whereby the members of the governing party would sit on the benches to the right of the Speaker and the opposition members on the benches to the left. It is said that the Speaker&#x27;s chair was placed in front of the chapel&#x27;s altar. As Members came and went they observed the custom of bowing to the altar and continued to do so, even when it had been taken away, thus then bowing to the Chair, as is still the custom today.

The numbers of the Lords Spiritual diminished under Henry VIII, who commanded the Dissolution of the Monasteries, thereby depriving the abbots and priors of their seats in the Upper House. For the first time, the Lords Temporal were more numerous than the Lords Spiritual. Currently, the Lords Spiritual consist of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and twenty-one other English diocesan bishops in seniority of appointment to a diocese.

The Laws in Wales Acts of 1535–42 annexed Wales as part of England and this brought Welsh representatives into the Parliament of England, first elected in 1542.

== Rebellion and revolution ==

Parliament had not always submitted to the wishes of the Tudor monarchs. But parliamentary criticism of the monarchy reached new levels in the 17th century. When the last Tudor monarch, Elizabeth I, died in 1603, King James VI of Scotland came to power as King James I, founding the Stuart monarchy.

In 1628, alarmed by the arbitrary exercise of royal power, the House of Commons submitted to Charles I the Petition of Right, demanding the restoration of their liberties. Though he accepted the petition, Charles later dissolved parliament and ruled without them for eleven years. It was only after the financial disaster of the Scottish Bishops&#x27; Wars (1639–1640) that he was forced to recall Parliament so that they could authorise new taxes. This resulted in the calling of the assemblies known historically as the Short Parliament of 1640 and the Long Parliament, which sat with several breaks and in various forms between 1640 and 1660.

The Long Parliament was characterised by the growing number of critics of the king who sat in it. The most prominent of these critics in the House of Commons was John Pym. Tensions between the king and his parliament reached a boiling point in January 1642 when Charles entered the House of Commons and tried, unsuccessfully, to arrest Pym and four other members for their alleged treason. The Five Members had been tipped off about this, and by the time Charles came into the chamber with a group of soldiers they had disappeared. Charles was further humiliated when he asked the Speaker, William Lenthall, to give their whereabouts, which Lenthall famously refused to do.

From then on relations between the king and his parliament deteriorated further. When trouble started to brew in Ireland, both Charles and his parliament raised armies to quell the uprisings by native Catholics there. It was not long before it was clear that these forces would end up fighting each other, leading to the English Civil War which began with the Battle of Edgehill in October 1642: those supporting the cause of parliament were called Parliamentarians (or Roundheads), and those in support of the Crown were called Royalists (or Cavaliers).

Battles between Crown and Parliament continued throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, but parliament was no longer subservient to the English monarchy. This change was symbolised in the execution of Charles I in January 1649.

In Pride&#x27;s Purge of December 1648, the New Model Army (which by then had emerged as the leading force in the parliamentary alliance) purged Parliament of members that did not support them. The remaining Rump Parliament, as it was later referred to by critics, enacted legislation to put the king on trial for treason. This trial, the outcome of which was a foregone conclusion, led to the execution of the king and the start of an 11-year republic.

The House of Lords was abolished and the purged House of Commons governed England until April 1653, when army chief Oliver Cromwell dissolved it after disagreements over religious policy and how to carry out elections to parliament. Cromwell later convened a parliament of religious radicals in 1653, commonly known as Barebone&#x27;s Parliament, followed by the unicameral First Protectorate Parliament that sat from September 1654 to January 1655 and the Second Protectorate Parliament that sat in two sessions between 1656 and 1658, the first session was unicameral and the second session was bicameral.

Although it is easy to dismiss the English Republic of 1649–60 as nothing more than a Cromwellian military dictatorship, the events that took place in this decade were hugely important in determining the future of parliament. First, it was during the sitting of the first Rump Parliament that members of the House of Commons became known as MPs (Members of Parliament). Second, Cromwell gave a huge degree of freedom to his parliaments, although royalists were barred from sitting in all but a handful of cases. 

Cromwell&#x27;s vision of parliament appears to have been largely based on the example of the Elizabethan parliaments. However, he underestimated the extent to which Elizabeth I and her ministers had directly and indirectly influenced the decision-making process of her parliaments. He was thus always surprised when they became troublesome. He ended up dissolving each parliament that he convened. Yet the structure of the second session of the Second Protectorate Parliament of 1658 was almost identical to the parliamentary structure consolidated in the Glorious Revolution Settlement of 1689.

In 1653 Cromwell had been made head of state with the title Lord Protector of the Realm. The Second Protectorate Parliament offered him the crown. Cromwell rejected this offer, but the governmental structure embodied in the final version of the Humble Petition and Advice was a basis for all future parliaments. It proposed an elected House of Commons as the Lower Chamber, a House of Lords containing peers of the realm as the Upper Chamber. A constitutional monarchy, subservient to parliament and the laws of the nation, would act as the executive arm of the state at the top of the tree, assisted in carrying out their duties by a Privy Council. Oliver Cromwell had thus inadvertently presided over the creation of a basis for the future parliamentary government of England. In 1657 he had the Parliament of Scotland (temporarily) unified with the English Parliament.

In terms of the evolution of parliament as an institution, by far the most important development during the republic was the sitting of the Rump Parliament between 1649 and 1653. This proved that parliament could survive without a monarchy and a House of Lords if it wanted to. Future English monarchs would never forget this. Charles I was the last English monarch ever to enter the House of Commons. 

Even to this day, a Member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sent to Buckingham Palace as a ceremonial hostage during the State Opening of Parliament, in order to ensure the safe return of the sovereign from a potentially hostile parliament. During the ceremony the monarch sits on the throne in the House of Lords and signals for the Lord Great Chamberlain to summon the House of Commons to the Lords Chamber. The Lord Great Chamberlain then raises his wand of office to signal to the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who has been waiting in the central lobby. Black Rod turns and, escorted by the doorkeeper of the House of Lords and an inspector of police, approaches the doors to the chamber of the Commons. The doors are slammed in his face—symbolising the right of the Commons to debate without the presence of the monarch&#x27;s representative. He then strikes three times with his staff (the Black Rod), and he is admitted.

== Parliament from the Restoration to the Act of Settlement ==
The revolutionary events that occurred between 1620 and 1689 all took place in the name of Parliament. The new status of Parliament as the central governmental organ of the English state was consolidated during the events surrounding the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660.

After the death of Oliver Cromwell in September 1658, his son Richard Cromwell succeeded him as Lord Protector, summoning the Third Protectorate Parliament in the process. When this parliament was dissolved under pressure from the army in April 1659, the Rump Parliament was recalled at the insistence of the surviving army grandees. This in turn was dissolved in a coup led by army general John Lambert, leading to the formation of the Committee of Safety, dominated by Lambert and his supporters.

When the breakaway forces of George Monck invaded England from Scotland, where they had been stationed without Lambert&#x27;s supporters putting up a fight, Monck temporarily recalled the Rump Parliament and reversed Pride&#x27;s Purge by recalling the entirety of the Long Parliament. They then voted to dissolve themselves and call new elections, which were arguably the most democratic for 20 years although the franchise was still very small. This led to the calling of the Convention Parliament which was dominated by royalists. This parliament voted to reinstate the monarchy and the House of Lords. Charles II returned to England as king in May 1660. The Anglo-Scottish parliamentary union that Cromwell had established was dissolved in 1661 when the Scottish Parliament resumed its separate meeting place in Edinburgh.

The Restoration began the tradition whereby all governments looked to parliament for legitimacy. In 1681 Charles II dissolved parliament and ruled without them for the last four years of his reign. This followed bitter disagreements between the king and parliament that had occurred between 1679 and 1681. Charles took a big gamble by doing this. He risked the possibility of a military showdown akin to that of 1642. However, he rightly predicted that the nation did not want another civil war. Parliament disbanded without a fight. Events that followed ensured that this would be nothing but a temporary blip.

Charles II died in 1685 and he was succeeded by his brother James II. During his lifetime Charles had always pledged loyalty to the Protestant Church of England, despite his private Catholic sympathies. James was openly Catholic. He attempted to lift restrictions on Catholics taking up public offices. This was bitterly opposed by Protestants in his kingdom. They invited William of Orange, a Protestant who had married Mary, daughter of James II and Anne Hyde to invade England and claim the throne.

William assembled an army estimated at 15,000 soldiers (11,000 foot and 4000 horse) and landed at Brixham in south-west England in November, 1688. When many Protestant officers, including James&#x27;s close adviser, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, defected from the English army to William&#x27;s invasion force, James fled the country. Parliament then offered the Crown to his Protestant daughter Mary, instead of his infant son (James Francis Edward Stuart), who was baptised Catholic. Mary refused the offer, and instead William and Mary ruled jointly, with both having the right to rule alone on the other&#x27;s death.

As part of the compromise in allowing William to be King—called the Glorious Revolution—Parliament was able to have the 1689 Bill of Rights enacted. Later the 1701 Act of Settlement was approved. These were statutes that lawfully upheld the prominence of parliament for the first time in English history. These events marked the beginning of the English constitutional monarchy and its role as one of the three elements of parliament.

== Union: the Parliament of Great Britain ==

After the Treaty of Union in 1707, acts of Parliament passed in both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland created a new Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved both parliaments, replacing them with a new Parliament of Great Britain based in the former home of the English parliament. The Parliament of Great Britain later became the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1801 when the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was formed through the Acts of Union 1800.

<text>The Saatchi Gallery is a London gallery for contemporary art and an independent charity opened by Charles Saatchi in 1985. Exhibitions which drew upon the collection of Charles Saatchi, starting with US artists and minimalism, moving to the Damien Hirst-led Young British Artists, followed by shows purely of painting, led to Saatchi Gallery becoming a recognised authority in contemporary art globally. It has occupied different premises, first in North London, then the South Bank by the River Thames, and finally in Chelsea, Duke of York&#x27;s HQ, its current location. In 2019 Saatchi Gallery became a registered charity and began a new chapter in its history. Recent exhibitions include the major solo exhibition of the artist JR, &quot;JR: Chronicles&quot;, and &quot;London Grads Now&quot; in September 2019 lending the gallery spaces to graduates from leading fine art schools who experienced the cancellation of physical degree shows due to the pandemic.

The gallery&#x27;s mission is to support artists and render contemporary art accessible to all by presenting projects in physical and digital spaces that are engaging, enlightening and educational for diverse audiences. The Gallery presents curated exhibitions on themes relevant and exciting in the context of contemporary creative culture. Its educational programmes aim to reveal the possibilities of artistic expression to young minds, encourage fresh thought and stimulate innovation.

In 2019, Saatchi Gallery transitioned to becoming a charitable organisation, relying upon private donations to reinvest its revenue into its core learning activities and to support access to contemporary art for all.

==History==
===Boundary Road===

====Opening and US art====
The Saatchi Gallery opened in 1985 in Boundary Road, St John&#x27;s Wood, London in a disused paint factory of . The first exhibition was held March—October 1985 featured many works by American minimalist Donald Judd, American abstract painters Brice Marden and Cy Twombly, and American pop artist Andy Warhol. This was the first U.K. exhibition for Twombly and Marden.

These were followed throughout December 1985 – July 1986 by an exhibition of works by American sculptor John Chamberlain, American minimalists Dan Flavin, Sol LeWitt, Robert Ryman, Frank Stella, and Carl Andre. During September 1986 – July 1987, the gallery exhibited German artist Anselm Kiefer and American minimalist sculptor Richard Serra. The exhibited Serra sculptures were so large that the caretaker&#x27;s flat adjoining the gallery was demolished to make room for them.

From September 1987 – January 1988, the Saatchi Gallery mounted two exhibitions entitled &quot;New York Art Now&quot;, featuring Jeff Koons, Robert Gober, Peter Halley, Haim Steinbach, Philip Taaffe, and Caroll Dunham. This exhibition introduced these artists to the U.K. for the first time. The blend of minimalism and pop art influenced many young artists who would later form the Young British Artists (YBA) group.

April – October 1988 featured exhibited works by American figurative painter Leon Golub, German painter and photographer Sigmar Polke, and American Abstract Expressionist painter Philip Guston. During November 1988 – April 1989 a group show featured contemporary American artists, most prominently Eric Fischl. From April – October, the gallery hosted exhibitions of American minimalist Robert Mangold and American conceptual artist Bruce Nauman. From November 1989 – February 1990, a series of exhibitions featured School of London artists including Lucian Freud, Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff and Howard Hodgkin.

During January – July 1991, the gallery exhibited the work of American pop artist Richard Artschwager, American photographer Cindy Sherman, and British installation artist Richard Wilson. Wilson&#x27;s piece &quot;20:50&quot;, a room entirely filled with oil, became a permanent installation at the Saatchi Gallery&#x27;s Boundary Road venue. September 1991 – February 1992 featured a group show, including American photographer Andres Serrano.

====Young British Artists====
In an abrupt move, Saatchi sold much of his collection of US art, and invested in a new generation of British artists, exhibiting them in shows with the title &quot;Young British Artists.&quot; The core of the artists had been brought together by Damien Hirst in 1988 in a seminal show called &quot;Freeze&quot;. Saatchi augmented this with his own choice of purchases from art colleges and &quot;alternative&quot; artist-run spaces in London. His first showing of the YBAs was in 1992, where the star exhibit was a Hirst vitrine containing a cow&#x27;s head eaten by flies. 
Brooks, Richard. &quot;Hirst&#x27;s shark is sold to America&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, 16 January 2005. Retrieved 14 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the symbol of Britart worldwide.

More recently Saatchi said, &quot;It&#x27;s not that &quot;Freeze&quot;, the 1988 exhibition that Damien Hirst organised with this fellow Goldsmiths College students, was particularly good. Much of the art was fairly so-so and Hirst himself hadn&#x27;t made anything much just a cluster of small colourful cardboard boxes placed high on a wall. What really stood out was the hopeful swagger of it all.&quot;

Saatchi&#x27;s promotion of these artists dominated local art throughout the nineties and brought them to worldwide notice. Among the artists in the series of shows were Jenny Saville, Sarah Lucas, Gavin Turk, Jake and Dinos Chapman and Rachel Whiteread.

&quot;Sensation&quot; opened in September at the Royal Academy to much controversy and showed 110 works by 42 artists from the Saatchi collection. In 1999 &quot;Sensation&quot; toured to the Nationalgalerie at the Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin in the autumn, and then to the Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York, creating unprecedented political and media controversy and becoming a touchstone for debate about the &quot;morality&quot; of contemporary art.

====Neurotic Realism and philanthropy====
Meanwhile, other shows with different themes were held in the gallery itself. In 1998, Saatchi launched a two part exhibition entitled &quot;Neurotic Realism&quot;. Though widely attacked by critics, the exhibition included many future international stars including; Cecily Brown, Ron Mueck, Noble and Webster, Dexter Dalwood, Martin Maloney, Dan Coombs, Chantal Joffe, Michael Raedecker and David Thorpe. In 2000 &quot;Ant Noises&quot; (an anagram of &quot;sensation&quot;), also in two parts, tried surer ground with work by Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Jenny Saville, Rachel Whiteread, the Chapmans, Gavin Turk, Tracey Emin and Chris Ofili.

During this period the Collection was based at &#x27;30 Underwood St&#x27; an artist Collective of 50 studios and four galleries, the gallery made several large philanthropic donations including 100 artworks in 1999 to the Arts Council of Great Britain Collection, which operates a &quot;lending library&quot; to museums and galleries around the country, with the aim of increasing awareness and promoting interest in younger artists; 40 works by young British artists through the National Art Collections Fund, now known as the Art Fund, to eight museum collections across Britain in 2000; and 50 artworks to the Paintings in Hospitals program which provides a lending library of over 3,000 original works of art to NHS hospitals, hospices and health centers throughout England, Wales and Ireland in 2002.

After the Gallery moved from Boundary Road, the site was redeveloped by the Ardmore Group for residential use, under the name &#x27;The Collection&#x27;.

===County Hall===

In April 2003, the gallery moved to County Hall, the Greater London Council&#x27;s former headquarters on the South Bank, occupying of the ground floor. 1,000 guests attended the launch, which included a &quot;nude happening&quot; of 200 naked people staged by artist Spencer Tunick.

The opening exhibition included a retrospective by Damien Hirst, as well as work by other YBAs, such as Jake and Dinos Chapman and Tracey Emin alongside some longer-established artists including John Bratby, Paula Rego and Patrick Caulfield.
Hirst disassociated himself from the retrospective to the extent of not including it in his CV. He was angry that a Mini car that he had decorated for charity with his trademark spots was being exhibited as serious work. The show also scuppered a prospective Hirst retrospective at Tate Modern. He said Saatchi was &quot;childish&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m not Charles Saatchi&#x27;s barrel-organ monkey ... He only recognises art with his wallet ... he believes he can affect art values with buying power, and he still believes he can do it.&quot; (In July 2004, Hirst said, &quot;I respect Charles. There&#x27;s not really a feud. If I see him, we speak, but we were never really drinking buddies.&quot;)

On 24 May 2004, a fire in the Momart storage warehouse destroyed many works from the collection, including the Tracey Emin work &quot;Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–95&quot; (&quot;the tent&quot;), and Jake and Dinos Chapman&#x27;s tableau &quot;Hell&quot;. A gallery spokesman said that Saatchi was distraught at the loss: &quot;It is terrible. A significant part of the work in his collection has been affected.&quot; One art insurance specialist valued the lost work at £50m.

In 2004, Saatchi&#x27;s recent acquisitions (including Stella Vine) were featured in &quot;New Blood&quot;, a show of mostly little-known artists working in a variety of media. It received a hostile critical reception, which caused Saatchi to speak out angrily against the critics.

Saatchi, said that most YBAs would prove &quot;nothing but footnotes&quot; in history, and sold works from his YBA collection, beginning in December 2004 with Hirst&#x27;s iconic shark for nearly £7 million (he had bought it for £50,000 in 1991), followed by at least twelve other works by Hirst. Four works by Ron Mueck, including key works &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Dead Dad&quot;, went for an estimated £2.5 million. Mark Quinn&#x27;s &quot;Self&quot;, bought in 1991 for a reported £13,000, sold for £1.5 million. Saatchi also sold all but one work by Sam Taylor-Wood (he showed five in the &quot;Sensation&quot; show). The sale was compared to his sale in the 1980s of most of his postwar American art collection. David Lee said: &quot;Charles Saatchi has all the hallmarks of being a dealer, not a collector. He first talks up the works and then sells them.&quot;

In 2005, Saatchi changed direction, announcing a year-long, three-part series (subsequently extended to two years and seven parts), &quot;The Triumph of Painting&quot;. The opening exhibition focused on established European painters, including Marlene Dumas, Martin Kippenberger, Luc Tuymans and Peter Doig, who had not previously received such significant U.K. exposure. Shows in the series were scheduled to introduce young painters from America like Dana Schutz and Germans such as Matthias Weischer, as well as Saatchi&#x27;s choice of up and coming British talent.

The gallery received 800,000 visitors a year. In 2006, 1,350 schools organised group visits to the gallery.

In 2006, a selection from &quot;The Triumph of Painting&quot; was exhibited in Leeds Art Gallery and &quot;USA Today: New American Art from the Saatchi Gallery&quot; opened at the Royal Academy. This exhibition toured to The State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia in 2007.

====Court case====
The gallery&#x27;s tenancy of County Hall had ongoing difficulties with Makoto Okamoto, London branch manager of the owners, who Saatchi complained had kicked artworks and sealed off the disabled toilets. On 28 September 2005, the gallery announced a move to new and larger premises in the Duke of York&#x27;s Headquarters, Chelsea, though Saatchi said it was &quot;tragic&quot; to leave. On 6 October 2005, a court case began, brought by the owners and landlord of County Hall, the Shirayama Shokusan Company and Cadogan Leisure Investments, against Danovo (Saatchi was its majority shareholder), trading as the Saatchi Gallery, for alleged breach of conditions, including a two-for-one ticket offer in &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine and exhibition of work in unauthorized areas. The judgment went against the gallery; the judge, Sir Donald Ratee, and ordered the gallery off the premises because of a &quot;deliberate disregard&quot; of the landlords&#x27; rights.

On 8 October 2006, Danovo was forced into liquidation with debts around £1.8 million, having failed to pay the court-ordered penalty.

===Duke of York&#x27;s HQ===

On 9 October 2008 the Gallery opened its new premises, described in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of &quot;the most beautiful art spaces in London&quot;, in the Duke of York&#x27;s HQ on Kings Road, London, near Sloane Square. The building was refurbished by architects Paul Davis + Partners and Allford Hall Monaghan Morris. It consists of 15 equally-proportioned exhibition spaces &quot;as light, as high, and as beautifully proportioned as any in London&quot;.

The main opening exhibition was of new Chinese art, &quot;The Revolution Continues: New Art From China&quot;, bringing together the work of twenty-four young Chinese artists in a survey of painting, sculpture and installation, including Zhang Huan, Li Songsong, Zhang Xiaogang, Zhang Haiying and conceptual artists Sun Yuan &amp; Peng Yu. The show&#x27;s focus was on political issues surrounding China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution and also the contemporary political context. The decision to open with &quot;The Revolution Continues&quot; was directly influenced by global interest in China as a result of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Jackie Wullschlager in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; said it was &quot;the most persuasive showing of contemporary Chinese art yet mounted in this country&quot;, and, contrasting it with the &quot;deadly&quot; contemporaneous Turner Prize show, &quot;Saatchi&#x27;s collection of Chinese art is one that Tate would kill for, and could not begin to afford&quot;; she said that it was &quot;an example of a private museum grand and serious enough to compete with national institutions.&quot;

More recent exhibitions include the London-leg of the touring show &quot;Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh&quot;, the solo exhibition of the artist JR, &quot;JR: Chronicles&quot;, and &quot;London Grads Now&quot; in September 2019 lending the gallery spaces to graduates from leading fine art schools who experienced the cancellation of a physical degree show due to the pandemic (described by critic Waldemar Januszczak in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as &quot;a good idea. Saatchi Gallery deserves a slap on the back for organising this selection of work from grads shows, a highlight of every art student&#x27;s education&quot;. The Gallery also hosts the annual &quot;Carmignac Photojournalism Award&quot; and various art fairs and global events including music group BICEP&#x27;s live global stream of their new album in March 2021.

====Philosophy====
Saatchi Gallery&#x27;s goal is to show contemporary work that would otherwise not be seen in London institutions such as Tate Modern. The gallery&#x27;s ex head of development, Rebecca Wilson, said, &quot;The gallery&#x27;s guiding principle is to show what is being made now, the most interesting artists of today. It&#x27;s about drawing people&#x27;s attentions to someone who might be tomorrow&#x27;s Damien Hirst.&quot; The gallery&#x27;s aim is to make art more accessible to the mainstream, rather than an exclusive artworld pursuit.

==Saatchi Online==

In 2006, during the period in limbo between premises, the gallery&#x27;s website began an open-access section, including Your Gallery, where artists can upload up to twenty works and a biography to a personal page. Over 100,000 artists had done so as of 2010, and the site receives an estimated 73 million hits a day. Your Gallery was later rebranded as Saatchi Online. In September 2008, Alexa Internet ranked Saatchi Gallery among the leading 300 websites in the world. In March 2012 Alexa ranked Saatchi Online&#x27;s position at 30,454. In November 2007 it was estimated that professional artists registered sell over $100 million of art directly from the site annually. In 2008 Saatchi Online launched a saleroom section that hosts over 84,000 entries from artists wishing to sell their work. For original work, Saatchi Online takes a 30% commission on the final sale price. If a Promotional discount code is offered, SO and Artist will split it equally. For prints, artists are entitled to 70% of the profit on each sale. Artists are also responsible for the costs of print production.

In October 2006 the Saatchi Gallery in association with &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper opened the first ever reader-curated exhibition, showing the work of 10 Saatchi Online artists. Users may also be featured in the Saatchi Online stall at various art fairs. In November 2006 the gallery launched a new section exclusively for art students, called Stuart. Stuart also hosts an annual competition, &quot;4 New Sensations&quot;, in association with Channel 4.

Other spaces on Saatchi Online including a forum, live chat, blogs, videos, photography and illustration. The site also publishes grant and funding opportunities. A daily magazine features 24-hour news updated every 15 minutes, as well as articles and reviews by art critics such as Jerry Saltz and Matthew Collings. The site recently began broadcasting an online television channel with video access to art openings, artists&#x27; studios, performances and interviews.

Interactive features include the weekly Showdown competition, where users can win an exhibition spot, the Online Studio for creating art (each month a critic selects a winner in whose name a £500 donation is made to a children&#x27;s charity) a Crits section in which artists can comment on each other&#x27;s work, and the Street Art section for graffiti, murals, and performance art.

&quot;Museums around the World&quot; features over 3,300 museums. These include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, the London National Gallery, the Louvre, and the State Hermitage, as well as small museums.

As of July 2008, 4,300 art dealers and commercial galleries have profiles on the site. Over 2,800 universities and colleges have uploaded prospectuses and student information, including Yale, Harvard, the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford, as well as local art colleges. Over 1,500 schools have uploaded pupils&#x27; work. Schools range from Eton College to small Primary and High schools. The Portfolio School Art Prize is open to schools with pupils between 5 and 17.

A Mandarin version allows Chinese artists to upload their profiles in Chinese and translates them into English. There is also a Chinese language chatroom, forum, and blog. The site provides automated translations into many languages; Russian, Spanish and Portuguese versions of the site are planned.

Saatchi Online was sold to Demand Media in August 2014, and was rebranded as SaatchiArt.com. The old Saatchi Online website now redirects there. Saatchi Art is an online marketplace where artists can go to sell originals and prints of their artwork to users of the site, with the website handling the details of the transaction and taking a 30% cut.

==Controversies==
*Artists such as Sandro Chia and Sean Scully, to whom Saatchi had been a patron in the late 1970s and early 1980s, felt betrayed by him when their work was sold in bulk from his collection, and Saatchi was accused of destroying Chia&#x27;s career. Saatchi said that the matter only became an issue because Chia &quot;had a psychological need to be rejected in public&quot; and is now &quot;most famous for being dumped&quot;, but that he had only ever owned seven Chias, which he sold back to Chia&#x27;s two dealers, who re-sold them easily to museums or notable collectors. Saatchi claimed that a sale of strong work can help to galvanise the market for them.
*In 1997, in &quot;Sensation&quot;, London, Marcus Harvey&#x27;s giant painting of Myra Hindley made from children&#x27;s hand prints was attacked by two men with ink and eggs, and picketed by the Mothers Against Murder and Aggression protest group, accompanied by Winnie Johnson, the mother of one of Hindley&#x27;s Moors murders victims. The work was restored and exhibited.

*The &quot;Sensation&quot; show in New York offended Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, because of Chris Ofili&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Holy Virgin Mary&quot;, which incorporates elephant dung. Giuliani, who had seen the work in the catalog but not in the show, called it &quot;sick stuff&quot; and threatened to withdraw the annual $7 million City Hall grant from the Brooklyn Museum hosting the show, because &quot;You don&#x27;t have a right to government subsidy for desecrating somebody else&#x27;s religion.&quot; John O&#x27;Connor, the Cardinal of New York, said, &quot;one must ask if it is an attack on religion itself&quot;, and the president of America&#x27;s biggest group of Orthodox Jews, Mandell Ganchrow, called it &quot;deeply offensive&quot;. William A Donohue, President of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, said the work &quot;induces revulsion&quot;. Giuliani started a lawsuit to evict the museum, and Arnold Lehman, the museum director, filed a federal lawsuit against Giuliani for breaching the First Amendment.

:Hillary Clinton and the New York Civil Liberties Union spoke up for the museum. The editorial board of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Giuliani&#x27;s stance &quot;promises to begin a new Ice Age in New York&#x27;s cultural affairs.&quot; The paper also carried a petition in support signed by 106, including Susan Sarandon, Steve Martin, Norman Mailer, Arthur Miller, Kurt Vonnegut and Susan Sontag, saying that the mayor &quot;blatantly disregards constitutional protection for freedom of the arts.&quot; Ofili, who is Roman Catholic, said, &quot;elephant dung in itself is quite a beautiful object.&quot; The museum produced a yellow stamp, saying the artworks on show &quot;may cause shock, vomiting, confusion, panic, euphoria and anxiety.&quot; and Ofili&#x27;s painting was shown behind a Plexiglass screen, guarded by a museum attendant and an armed police officer. Jeffrey Hogrefe, &quot;New York Observer&quot; art critic, said, &quot;They wanted to get some publicity and they got it. I think it was pretty calculated.&quot; The editor-in-chief of the New York &quot;Art &amp; Auction&quot; magazine, Bruce Wolmer, said: &quot;When the row eventually fades the only smile will be on the face of Charles Saatchi, a master self-promoter.&quot; Giuliani lost his court case and was forced to restore funding.

*&quot;Sensation&quot; was scheduled to open in June 2000 at the National Gallery of Australia, but was cancelled. Director Brian Kennedy said that, although it was due to be funded by the Australian government, it was &quot;too close to the market&quot;, since finance for the Brooklyn exhibition included $160,000 from Saatchi, who owned the work, $50,000 from Christie&#x27;s, who had sold work for Saatchi, and $10,000 from dealers of many of the artists. Kennedy said he was unaware of this when he accepted the show; Saatchi&#x27;s contribution, the largest single one, was not disclosed by the Brooklyn Museum until it appeared in court documents. When the show opened in London at the Royal Academy, there had been criticisms that it would raise the value of the work.
*In 2004, media controversy arose over two paintings by Stella Vine. One was of Princess Diana called &quot;Hi Paul Can You Come Over&quot;, showing the Princess with blood dripping from her lips. The other was of drug user Rachel Whitear, whose body was being exhumed at the time; Whitear&#x27;s parents and the police appealed for the painting to be withdrawn, but it was not.
*In 2004, the Stuckists reported Saatchi to the Office of Fair Trading alleging unfair competition. The complaint was not upheld. They also picketed the opening of &quot;The Triumph of Painting&quot; claiming that Saatchi had stolen their ideas. (Vine had previously been involved with the Stuckists.)
*In 2006, &quot;USA Today&quot; provoked controversy in the media and among some Royal Academicians who called for certain works to be installed in an &#x27;adult-only&#x27; room. A notice advising &#x27;parental guidance&#x27; before viewing the work of Dash Snow and Gerald Davis was posted by the Royal Academy, on a wall outside the room in which the controversial works were hung. These were Dash Snow&#x27;s &#x27;Fuck the Police&#x27;, in which newspaper cuttings relating to police corruption are smeared with the artist&#x27;s own semen, and a painting titled &quot;Monica&quot; by Gerald Davis in which a young woman engages in fellatio.

<text>Semper fidelis () is a Latin phrase that means &quot;always faithful&quot; or &quot;always loyal&quot; (Fidelis or Fidelity). It is the motto of the United States Marine Corps, usually shortened to Semper Fi. It is also in use as a motto for towns, families, schools, and other military units.

It is thought that it originated from the phrase that the senators of ancient Rome declaimed at the end of their intervention.

The earliest definitively recorded use of &quot;semper fidelis&quot; is as the motto of the French town of Abbeville since 1369. It has also been used by other towns, and is recorded as the motto of various European families since the 16th century, and possibly since the 13th century or earlier. Records show many families in England, France and Ireland using this motto.

The earliest recorded use of &quot;semper fidelis&quot; by a military unit is by the Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, raised in south-western England in 1685. This is apparently linked to its use as a motto by the city of Exeter no later than 1660. Subsequently, a variety of military organizations adopted the motto.

==Families and individuals==
This phrase was used in Europe, at least in Great Britain, Ireland and France and probably in other countries as well. A more recent adoption is by Senator Joe Doyle, in arms granted by the Chief Herald of Ireland in 1999.

Bernard Burke in 1884 listed many notable families in Great Britain and Ireland using the motto &quot;Semper fidelis&quot; in their coats of arms. They include:
* Lynch family (Ireland): &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; is the family motto of the Lynch family. The Lynches were one of the Tribes of Galway who were fourteen merchant families who dominated the political, commercial, and social life of the city of Galway in western Ireland between the 13th and 16th centuries. Members of the &#x27;Tribes&#x27; were considered Old English gentry. The Lynches were descended from William Le Petit, who was one of the Norman knights who settled in Ireland following the grant of Ireland as a fiefdom by Pope Adrian IV to King Henry II of England in the early 12th century. &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; appears on the Lynch Family coat of arms. Although the earliest traceable reference to this usage is James Hardiman&#x27;s history of Galway published in 1820, the history of the family makes it likely that the motto was in use by the 14th or 15th century.
* Frith family (Ireland): The family of John Frith, Protestant martyr, is thought to have used the motto as far back as the 16th century. John Frith is the earliest entry in Burke&#x27;s list of the Frith family. The Friths settled in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, after John Frith&#x27;s execution. The family fought at the Battle of the Boyne.
* Edge family (England): The Edge family of Strelley, Nottinghamshire, were using the motto &quot;Semper fidelis&quot; by 1814 at the latest (see UK National Archives document reference DD/E/209/32-34). The arms were granted in 1709, but it is not recorded whether the motto formed part of the initial grant.
* Molteno family (South Africa): The Molteno family motto is recorded as &quot;semper fidelis&quot; on versions of their arms held in the archives of the University of Cape Town.
* Onslow family (England): the family of the Earls of Onslow uses the motto &quot;Semper fidelis&quot; (see also Lodge, 1832), though their alternative motto (the punning &quot;Festina lente&quot;) is better known.
* Stewart family (Scotland; also spelled Steuart, especially in older sources): &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; is the family motto of the Stewart family of Ballechin in Perthshire. J. Burke (1836, pp. 149–150) records that the family goes back to an illegitimate son of James II of Scotland (1430–1460), and the motto is recorded by Burke and by Robson (1830). However they do not report the date of its first use.
Burke&#x27;s full list of families using the motto was: Booker, Barbeson, Bonner, Broadmead, Carney, Chesterman, Dick, Dickins, Duffield, Edge, Formby, Frisby, Garrett, Haslett, Hill, Houlton, Kearney, Lynch, Lund, Marriott, Nicholls, Onslow, Pollexfen, Smith, Steele, Steehler, Steuart, Stirling and Wilcoxon. A large portion of these families were Irish or Scottish.

Chassant and Tausin (1878, p. 647) list the following French families as using it: D&#x27;Arbaud of Jonques, De Bréonis, Chevalier of Pontis, Du Golinot of Mauny, De Coynart, De Genibrouse of Gastelpers, Macar of the Province of Liege, Milet of Mureau, Navoir of Ponzac, De Piomelles, De Poussois, de Lamarzelle, De Reymons, Henry de Lolière and De Rozerou of Mos.

==Cities==

===Abbeville (since 1369)===
The city of Abbeville in France is recorded by 19th century sources (such as Chassant and Taussin, 1878) as using the motto &quot;Semper fidelis,&quot; and recent sources state that the city was accorded this motto by Charles V, by letters patent of 19 June 1369, issued at Vincennes. This would make it the earliest recorded user of the motto among cities. However both Louandre (1834, p. 169) and the city&#x27;s current official website give the motto simply as &quot;Fidelis&quot;, and Sanson (1646, p. 15) claimed that even this was not part of Charles&#x27;s original grant, but was added later, sometime in the 14th to 17th centuries.

In 1658, Pope Alexander VII bestowed the heraldic motto &quot;Leopolis semper fidelis&quot; on Lviv (then Lwów, part of the Kingdom of Poland). In 1936, the motto &quot;Semper fidelis&quot; was applied again to the coat of arms of the city (then part of the Second Polish Republic).

Today, in Poland, the motto is referenced mainly in connection with the Polish-Ukrainian War of 1919 following the collapse of Austro-Hungary in the wake of World War I, and more especially in connection with the Polish-Bolshevik War that followed.

In Ukraine, the phrase is used much less, and refers to the survival of the Ukrainian Church through the period of Soviet persecution.

===Exeter (since 1660 or earlier)===

The City of Exeter, in Devon, England, has used the motto since at least 1660, when it appears in a manuscript of the local chronicler, Richard Izacke. Izacke claimed that the motto was adopted in 1588 to signify the city&#x27;s loyalty to the English Crown. According to Izacke, it was Queen Elizabeth I who suggested that the city adopt this motto (perhaps in imitation of her own motto, &quot;Semper eadem&quot;, &quot;Ever the same&quot;); her suggestion is said to have come in a letter to &quot;the Citizens of Exeter,&quot; in recognition of their gift of money toward the fleet that had defeated the Spanish Armada. John Hooker&#x27;s map of Exeter of around 1586 shows the city&#x27;s coat of arms without the motto, suggesting that the city&#x27;s use of the motto is no older than this. However the city archives do not hold any letter relating to the motto, and Grey (2005) argues that the Elizabethan origin of the motto may be no more than a local myth, since it is not recorded in contemporary chronicles, and that it may have been adopted at the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy to compensate for the city&#x27;s less than total loyalty to the crown during the English Civil War.

Various bodies associated with the city of Exeter also use the motto:
* The Royal Navy HMS &quot;Exeter&quot;, which is named after the City of Exeter.
* Various Exeter-based units of the British Army, see below.
* There is a Masonic Lodge in Exeter, called &quot;Lodge Semper Fidelis.&quot;
* Exeter City Police – the motto was inscribed on the force crest.
* Exeter City Fire Brigade featured the motto on their brigade crest
* Some versions of the crest of Exeter City Football Club

===St. Malo (since 17th century or earlier)===
&quot;Semper fidelis&quot; is the motto of the town of St. Malo, in Brittany, France. The date of its adoption is not known, but it appears to have been in use in the 17th century, replacing an earlier motto, &quot;Cave canem&quot;.

===Calvi===
&quot;Civitas Calvi Semper Fidelis&quot; may have been the motto of the city of Calvi, Balagna area in Corsica for 500 years.

===White Plains===
&quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; is the motto of the city of White Plains, in New York, United States.

==Military units==
===Regiments from south-western England (from 1685)===
The south-western English city of Exeter has used the motto &quot;semper fidelis&quot; since no later than 1660, inspiring its use by several south-western English military units.

====Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s Regiment of Foot (from 1685)====
In 1685 the motto was used by Duke of Beaufort when The Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, or Beaufort Musketeers, were raised to defend Bristol against the Duke of Monmouth&#x27;s rebellion. It was numbered as the 11th Regiment of Foot when the numerical system of regimental designation was adopted in 1751 and was designated the regiment for North Devonshire (later the Devonshire Regiment).

====The 1st (Exeter and South Devon) Rifle Volunteer Corps (from 1852)====
The 1st (Exeter and South Devon) Rifle Volunteer Corps, raised in Exeter in 1852, was using the motto on its cap badge by 1860 at the latest; the Illustrated London News reported its use in its 7 January 1860 issue. The motto was continued by The Devonshire Regiment of the British Army.

====Devonshire and Dorset Regiment (from 1958)====
The motto was further continued on the badges of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment when the Devonshires were amalgamated into them in 1958. This use of the motto evidently derives from these regiments&#x27; close connection with the city of Exeter, where they had a base from their foundation (see the Illustrated London News article referenced above) until their disappearance by amalgamation into the Rifles in 2007.

===The Irish Brigade of France (1690–1792) (&quot;Semper et ubique Fidelis&quot;)===
The Irish units in France used a similar motto, &quot;Semper et ubique Fidelis&quot;, meaning &quot;Always and Everywhere Faithful&quot;. These units, forming the Irish Brigade, were raised in 1690-1 under the terms of the Treaty of Limerick, which ended the war between King James II and King William III in Ireland and Britain. As the native Irish army in exile, &quot;Semper et ubique Fidelis&quot; was a reference to their fidelity to the Catholic faith, King James II, and to the king of France. For decades the Irish Brigade served as an independent army within the French army, remaining &quot;Always and Everywhere Faithful&quot; to their native Gaelic Irish traditions (such as having the men elect their own officers, unheard of in France and England).

Antoine Walsh&#x27;s regiment of the Irish Brigade is noted for aiding the American cause in the American Revolution, when they were assigned as marines to John Paul Jones&#x27;s ship, the .

The involvement of Irish Brigade soldiers serving as marines in the American War of Independence may have inspired the eventual adoption of the motto &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; by the US Marines.

The phrase &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; was made the official motto of the Marine Corps by Charles Grymes McCawley, the eighth Commandant of the Marine Corps, who was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which had a large Irish Catholic population. McCawley owed his commission to Senator Pierre Soulé of Louisiana, a Catholic born and raised in France, who would have been well aware of the Irish Brigade&#x27;s service as Marines during the American Revolution.

===French 47th Infantry Regiment===
The French 47th Infantry Regiment used &quot;Semper fidelis&quot; as its motto.

===Cadet Corps of the Dutch Royal Military Academy (since 1828)===
&quot;Semper fidelis&quot; is the motto of the cadets corps of the Dutch Royal Military Academy. The corps was founded on 24 November 1828.

===11th Infantry Regiment, United States Army (since 1861)===
&quot;Semper fidelis&quot; is also the motto of the 11th Infantry Regiment, which was founded in May 1861 by President Abraham Lincoln. It served as part of the Army of Ohio and later in the Indian wars, Spanish–American War, 1916 Mexican Border war, World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War. Today the regiment trains young Army officers at Fort Moore, Georgia.

=== The West Nova Scotia Regiment (since 1936, inherited from Lunenburg Regiment, 1870) ===
&quot;Semper fidelis&quot; is the motto of The West Nova Scotia Regiment (of the Canadian Armed Forces), formed in 1936. It inherited the motto from The Lunenburg Regiment, formed in 1870.

===The United States Marine Corps (since 1883)===
The United States Marine Corps adopted the motto &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; in 1883, on the initiative of Colonel Charles McCawley (29 January 1827 – 13 October 1891), the 8th Commandant of the Marine Corps.

There were three mottos prior to Semper Fidelis including
&quot;Fortitudine&quot; (meaning &quot;with courage&quot;) antedating the War of 1812, &quot;Per Mare, Per Terram&quot; (&quot;by sea, by land&quot;; presumably inherited from the British Royal Marines, who have that as a motto), and, up until 1843, there was also the Marines&#x27; Hymn motto &quot;To the Shores of Tripoli&quot;. &quot;Semper fidelis&quot; signifies the dedication and loyalty that individual Marines have for &#x27;Corps and Country&#x27;, even after leaving service. Marines frequently shorten the motto to &quot;Semper Fi&quot; .

* &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; is also the title of the official march of the United States Marine Corps, composed by John Philip Sousa in 1889. Sousa was director of the United States Marine Band &quot;(The President&#x27;s Own)&quot; when a replacement for &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; was requested, but later rejected. Sousa considered it to be his &#x27;most musical&#x27; march. It was prominently featured in the film &quot;A Few Good Men.&quot; Charles Burr wrote the .
* On the United States Marine Corps Seal, the symbols of the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor emblem holds a ribbon emblazoned &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot;.

===Canadian Forces Base Valcartier (since 1914)===
&quot;Semper fidelis&quot; is the motto of CFB Valcartier. The base was originally erected as a military camp in August 1914.

===Italian Carabinieri (similar non-Latin version) (From 1933)===
An Italian version of &quot;Semper fidelis&quot;, &quot;Nei secoli fedele&quot;, or &quot;Loyal over the centuries&quot;, has been the motto of the Italian Carabinieri, granted by king Victor Emmanuel III.

===Swiss Grenadiers (since 1943)===
The Swiss Grenadiers, first designated as such in 1943, and since 2004 forming a distinct Command in the Swiss Armed Forces, use the motto &quot;Semper fidelis&quot;.

===Republic of China Marine Corps (similar non-Latin version) (since 1947)===

<text>The Church of God (Anderson, Indiana), also called the Church of God Ministries, is an international holiness Christian denomination with roots in Wesleyan-Arminianism and also in the restorationist traditions. The organization grew out of the evangelistic efforts of several Holiness evangelists in Indiana and Michigan in the early 1880s, most notably Daniel Sidney Warner. 

One of its more distinctive features is that there is no formal membership, since the movement believes that true salvation through Jesus Christ, the son of God, makes one a member. Similarly, there is no formal creed other than the Bible. Accordingly, there is much official room for diversity and theological dialogue, even though the movement&#x27;s culture is strongly rooted in Wesleyan holiness theology.

The Church of God (Anderson, Indiana) is related to its conservative holiness Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma) offshoot, though it is not historically related to other Church of God bodies such as the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) or the Church of God (Charleston, Tennessee) as the Church of God (Anderson) does not share the Pentecostal practices of the latter two denominations. Although not part of the organization&#x27;s formal name, &quot;Anderson, Indiana&quot; is usually appended to its name to distinguish it from these other groups.

==History==

The history of the Church of God (Anderson) begins in 1881 with Daniel Sidney Warner and several others. Warner had been a member of John Winebrenner&#x27;s General Eldership of the Church of God, whose members were called Winebrennerians. He differed with the Winebrennerians on the doctrine of sanctification, which he held to be a second definite work of grace, and on the nature of the church. The desire of Warner and the others was to forsake denominationalism and creeds. To this end, they determined to trust in the Holy Spirit as their guide and the Bible as their creed. Warner&#x27;s vision was that the Church of God would &quot;extend our hand in fellowship to every blood-washed one&quot;, rather than align themselves with a movement.

From its beginnings, the Church of God had a commitment to pacifism and antiracism. The Church of God held that &quot;interracial worship was a sign of the true Church&quot;, with both whites and blacks ministering regularly in Church of God congregations, which invited people of all races to worship there. Those who were entirely sanctified testified that they were &quot;saved, sanctified, and prejudice removed.&quot; When Church of God ministers, such as Lena Shoffner, visited the camp meetings of other denominations, the rope in the congregation that separated whites and blacks was untied &quot;and worshipers of both races approached the altar to pray&quot;. Though outsiders would sometimes attack Church of God services and camp meetings for their stand for racial equality, Church of God members were &quot;undeterred even by violence&quot; and &quot;maintained their strong interracial position as the core of their message of the unity of all believers&quot;. In the late 19th century, the Church of God used their journal, the &quot;Gospel Trumpet&quot;, to disseminate pacifist view. In April 1898, the &quot;Gospel Trumpet&quot; responded to a question about the Church of God&#x27;s stance on a Christian going to war. The answer printed was &quot;We answer no. Emphatically no. There is no place in the New Testament wherein Christ gave instruction to his followers to take the life of a fellow-man&quot;. As time went on the Church of God maintained their stance on pacifism, but as World War I was erupting across Europe, the church&#x27;s stance began to soften. When German Church of God congregants were drafted into the army, the &quot;Gospel Trumpet&quot; began running letters submitted about the conditions of training camps and on the battlefields. While encouraging their readers to pray for the German soldiers, the &quot;Gospel Trumpet&quot; made no reference to the apparent contrast between supporting the war effort and encouraging pacifism.

As the United States entered World War I, the &quot;Gospel Trumpet&quot; restated the church&#x27;s official stance of pacifism but also reminded their congregants that they supported the authority of the state and should comply with local laws concerning the draft. There were articles published to help a pacifist request non-combat duty if they were drafted. For those who decided to volunteer, the church reported that the volunteer would not lose their salvation but would have to answer to God concerning their actions during the war. Strege writes that as the war waged on, &quot;there occurs in print no condemnation of those who entered the army—whether German or American—and there is no questioning of their religious commitment&quot;.

The Church of God pacifist stance reached a high point in the late 1930s. The Church regarded World War II as a just war because America was attacked. Sentiment against Communism (which advocated for state atheism in the Eastern Bloc) has since kept strong pacifism from developing in the Church of God.

===Developments in holiness standards===
The Church of God continues to see itself as a direct outgrowth of the original teachings of D.S. Warner&#x27;s ministry that began the movement in the 1880s. Warner believed that every group of organized churches who had an earthly headquarters and an earthly creed, other than the Bible, was a part of Babylon. He and his later followers taught that God had restored the light of Christian unity in 1880. The Evening Light ministry became known as &quot;come outers&quot; because they traveled from town to town preaching that all of the saved needed to &quot;come out of Babylon&quot; and worship together in one place rather than being separated by creeds, dogmas and doctrines of men. The Reformation Ministry (another name for their ministry) believed that false Christianity was the harlot woman in the book of Revelation. The ministry further believed that the harlot woman was a symbol of Roman Catholicism and that her daughters were a symbol of Protestantism.

As an example of their emphasis on the nature of the true Church, the slogan of the Church of God paper, &quot;One Voice&quot;, almost became &quot;On Becoming the Church&quot;. The Evening Light Ministry of 1880-1915 believed that they taught the whole truth of Scripture and that they were setting the example for the true Church. In the process, they had placed a strong emphasis on what was seen as &quot;holiness living.&quot; This led to a sense that certain cultural practices then common in late nineteenth and early twentieth America were out of bounds for the &quot;sanctified Christian.&quot; Adherents saw it as non-conformity to the world, that is, that Christ had called them out of the &quot;worldliness&quot; around them, both internally and externally.

Some re-thinking began in 1912 when men were permitted to wear long neck ties. By the 1950s, the movement no longer forcefully taught against the immodesty of mixed bathing (swimming) among the sexes or the addition of a television to the home. These twentieth century changes focused on the idea that the internal transformations of holiness deserved far more emphasis than debates over its proper outward manifestation, such as styles of dress and some forms of worship. In his 1978 work for the Church, &quot;Receive the Holy Spirit&quot;, Arlo Newell addressed his view of the nature of holiness for Christian living, emphasizing its internal requirements. Expressing the still dominant view in the Church of God, Newell stated that &quot;holiness centers in completeness. Christ was and is the perfect sacrifice, none other need ever be made. Every believer in Christ has entered into the &#x27;everlasting covenant,&#x27; and the extent of the work of redemption is limitless.&quot; Emphasizing the point, Newell went on to give a definition of the man who is holy. He noted that &quot;the holy man is the whole man, integrated, harmonized within by his supreme, inclusive purpose to realize in himself and others the moral image of God revealed in Christ, God incarnate.&quot;

Thus, as the movement increasingly de-emphasized the importance of external manifestations of &quot;holy living,&quot; teaching against the following list of practices, while still valued by some, is no longer emphasized by the Church of God:
* against outward adornment: wedding rings, ear rings, lipstick on women, or following &quot;worldly fashions&quot; (there is still an emphasis by some on &quot;modesty&quot;, i.e. non-ostentatiousness in such things)
* women should always refrain from wearing clothing that pertains to men, e.g. pants
* women should not cut their hair but instead grow it long and men should keep their hair short
* ministers should not receive a set salary

The Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), a body in the conservative holiness movement, was created in the 1910s as a result of schism with the Church of God (Anderson, Indiana) over wanting to maintain traditional standards of outward holiness.

==Statistics==
According to a census published by the association in 2020, it had 7,800 churches, 887,000 members in 89 countries. In 2010, it was reported that the Church of God (Anderson) had 225,753 members in the United States in 2,125 churches.

==Beliefs==

In connection to its beginnings, the denomination has holiness beliefs.

While the church keeps congregant statistics for organizational reasons, it does not have official membership. It holds that all &quot;blood washed ones&quot; (Christians) are part of the church and that attending services is enough to count someone as a member of a congregation.

The church observes baptism by total immersion, the Lord&#x27;s Supper (commonly known as communion), and feet washing as symbolic acts, recognizing them as the ordinances of God.

While the church does not believe in official creeds, the Anderson School of Theology has released several pamphlets available online which outline their interpretation of the Bible on multiple points such as Eschatology, which is Amillennial. Congregants are generally not bound to these statements which are framed as being suggestive.

==Organization==
Church polity is autonomous and congregational, with various state and regional assemblies offering some basic support for pastors and congregations. In North America, cooperative work is coordinated through Church of God Ministries with offices in Anderson, Indiana. Currently, the general director is Jim Lyon.

There are 2,214 congregations in the United States and Canada which are affiliated with the Church of God with an average attendance of 251,429. Worldwide, adherents number more than 1,170,143 in 7,446 congregations spread over nearly ninety countries. In Jamaica, Church of God is the first denomination with 24% of the population and 111 congregations. Personal conversion and Christian conduct, coupled with attendance, are sufficient for participation in a local Church of God congregation.

In the United Kingdom, there are 2 congregations: Church of God, Egan Road (Birkenhead, Merseyside) under the leadership of Pastor Zach Langford and Community Church of God (Tottenham, London) under the leadership of Pastor Mickell Mascall.

In East Africa Bunyore is home to the national headquarters of the Church of God in Kenya, Bunyore Girls’ High School and Kima School of Theology all of which are located at Kima. A significant town in Bunyore is Luanda, Kenya located on the Kisumu-Busia Highway. Maseno University, in the neighboring Maseno town is less than 6 miles from Kima which was under Archbishop Rev Dr. Byrum A. Makokha until his death on 25/08/2020.

==Affiliated schools==
The church&#x27;s seminary is Anderson School of Theology in Anderson, Indiana. It is also affiliated with several colleges across North America, including Anderson University, Mid-America Christian University, Warner Pacific University, Warner University and West Indies Theological College as well as Kima International School of Theology (KIST) in Maseno, Kenya, and IBAO (Institut Biblique de l&#x27;Afrique de l&#x27;Ouest) in Yamoussoukro, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

The church also supports Triple C School, a primary and secondary school located in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands.

<text>A defense contractor is a business organization or individual that provides products or services to a military or intelligence department of a government. Products typically include military or civilian aircraft, ships, vehicles, weaponry, and electronic systems, while services can include logistics, technical support and training, communications support, and engineering support in cooperation with the government.

Security contractors do not generally provide direct support of military operations. Under the 1949 Geneva Conventions, military contractors engaged in direct support of military operations may be legitimate targets of military interrogation.

In the United States, defense contracting has taken an increasingly larger role. In 2009, the Department of Defense spent nearly $316 billion on contracts. Contractors have assumed a much larger on-the-ground presence during American conflicts: during the 1991 Gulf War the ratio of uniformed military to contractors was about 50 to 1, while during the first four years of the Iraq War the U.S. hired over 190,000 contractors, surpassing the total American military presence even during the 2007 Iraq surge and 23 times greater than other allied military personnel numbers. In Afghanistan, the presence of almost 100,000 contractors has resulted in a near 1-to-1 ratio with military personnel. The surge in spending on defense services contractors that began in 2001 came to a halt in 2009, leading to the Better Buying Power initiative of 2010.

<text>The Woolsack is the seat of the Lord Speaker in the House of Lords, the Upper House of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Before 2006, it was the seat of the Lord Chancellor, who presided as the presiding officer of the House. The Woolsack’s status in the House was enshrined in the first standing orders in 1621.

==History==

In the 14th century, King Edward III (1327–1377) said that his Lord Chancellor, while in council, should sit on a wool bale, now known as &quot;The Woolsack&quot;, to symbolise the central nature and great importance of the wool trade to the economy of England in the Middle Ages. Indeed, it was largely to protect the vital English wool trade routes with continental Europe that the Battle of Crécy was fought with the French in 1346.

In 1938, it was discovered that the Woolsack was stuffed with horsehair. When it was remade, it was re-stuffed with wool from the British Isles and all over the British Commonwealth, supplied by the International Wool Secretariat, as a symbol of unity.

From the Middle Ages until 2006, the presiding officer in the House of Lords was the Lord Chancellor, and the Woolsack was usually mentioned in association with the office of Lord Chancellor. In July of that year, the function of Lord Speaker was split from that of Lord Chancellor under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, with the former now sitting on the Woolsack.

Until 1949, Canada&#x27;s Senate had a judges&#x27; woolsack. At the behest of Jean-François Pouliot, an MP from Quebec, who decried the use of a cushion on which the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s judges had to sprawl &quot;like urchins,&quot; the woolsack was eventually abolished and replaced with conventional chairs. The original woolsack is still extant.

==Ceremonial role==

The Woolsack is a large, wool-stuffed cushion covered with red cloth; it has neither a back nor arms, though, in the centre of the Woolsack, there is a back-rest. The Lords&#x27; Mace is placed on the rear part of the Woolsack when the House is in session. The Lord Speaker may speak from the Woolsack when speaking in their capacity as Speaker of the House but, if seeking to debate, must deliver their remarks either from the left side of the Woolsack or from the normal seats of the Lords.

If a Deputy Speaker presides in the absence of the Lord Speaker, then that individual uses the Woolsack. However, when the House meets in the &quot;Committee of the Whole&quot;, the Woolsack remains unoccupied, and the presiding officer, the Chairman or Deputy Chairman, occupies a chair at the front of the table of the House.

To keep dignity and order, members of the House must not pass between the woolsack and any member who is speaking or between the woolsack and the clerk&#x27;s table. If members wish to talk to each other while the House is sitting, they are not permitted to speak behind the woolsack and must retire to the Prince&#x27;s Chamber.
In front of the Woolsack are two even larger cushions known as the Judges&#x27; Woolsack. Any member of the House can sit on these two cushions during sessions. During the State Opening of Parliament, the Judges&#x27; Woolsack is occupied by the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the President of the King&#x27;s Bench Division, the President of the Family Division, the Chancellor of the High Court, the Lords Justices of Appeal and the Justices of the High Court, all of whom are summoned by writ to attend. The Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, who are likewise summoned to attend the State Opening, are seated nearby, as their predecessors the Law Lords formerly sat on the benches as Lords Temporal.

==Mentions in popular culture==

Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic opera &quot;Iolanthe&quot; is partially set in the grounds of the Palace of Westminster, the meeting place of the House of Lords, and the Lords appear as the male chorus and a fictional Lord Chancellor is a main character. The entire house, as well as the Lord Chancellor, have become attracted to Phyllis, a ward of chancery. The Lord Chancellor laments that propriety would not allow him to marry his ward, no matter how strongly he may care for her. He describes his position this way: &quot;Ah, my Lords, it is indeed painful to have to sit upon a woolsack which is stuffed with such thorns as these!&quot;

In &quot;Uncommon Law&quot; by A. P. Herbert, the newly-appointed Lady Chancellor finds the Woolsack uncomfortable and orders it replaced with a chair. Only after it has been removed does one of her fellow Law Lords mention that she should not have been sitting on the Woolsack when presiding on an appeal.

<text>Coronations in Poland officially began in 1025 and continued until 1764, when the final king of an independent Poland, Stanisław August Poniatowski, was crowned at St. John&#x27;s Cathedral in Warsaw. Most Polish coronations took place at the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, but crownings also occurred in Poznań and at Gniezno Cathedral. Whenever practical, Polish coronations were conducted as close as possible as to the date of the previous sovereign&#x27;s funeral. This was explained by Joachim Bielski in the sixteenth century as &quot;osoba umiera, korona nie umiera&quot;, or &quot;the person dies, the crown dies not&quot;. With the emergence of an independent, republican Poland after World War I, coronations in the Polish state have been rendered obsolete.

Though many of the Polish Crown Jewels were stolen and destroyed by King Frederick William III of Prussia in March 1809 after the Third Partition of Poland, remaining pieces are exhibited at the Wawel Royal Castle National Art Collection and National Museum in Warsaw.

== The ceremony ==
During the period when coronations were held in Kraków, the following order was observed: on the eve of his coronation, the new monarch fasted, gave alms, and partook of the Catholic sacrament of confession. He then walked on foot from the royal Wawel Castle to the Basilica of St. Stanisław, patron saint of Poland. Unlike the remainder of the service, the royal procession was opened to the Polish masses. On the morning of the ceremony, the king was met in his bedchamber by a procession consisting of the local Metropolitan Archbishop and other notables. Wearing Episcopal clothing, the monarch was blessed with holy water and incensed. Following this, king, metropolitan and the others made their way in procession to the cathedral.

Inside the church, the Polish regalia were laid on the high altar, while the king was seated on a low chair nearby. The royal oath was administered, and the new monarch then knelt before the altar. Two mitred abbots next entered from a side chapel, carrying a mixture of holy oils, with which the ruler was then anointed. Following this, the king was handed a sword, which he used to trace a cross in the air. Next he was crowned by the Archbishop, assisted by two other bishops, following which he received his orb and scepter. The high mass continued, with the newly crowned sovereign receiving Holy Communion, then kissing a crucifix and mounting his throne. Following this, the king created several new knights, then attended a coronation feast and rode into the public square on horseback, where he received the homage of his subjects while seated in a large chair.

== List of Polish coronations ==

<doc id="378105" wikidata="Q2879339" url="?curid=378105" title="Bai Hua">
<text>Bai Hua (; 20 November 1930 – 15 January 2019) was a Chinese novelist, playwright and poet. He gained national fame for his plays based on uncompromising historical criticism.

==Early life==
Bai was born Chen Youhua () in Xinyang, Henan in 1930. His mother was illiterate but able to sing folk songs, which became a lifelong interest for her son. His father, an anti-Japanese activist, was executed by the Japanese by burying him alive in 1938. Bai had a twin brother, Ye Nan (1930–2003), who became a successful movie scriptwriter in the 1980s.

== Career ==
Bai started publishing poems at the age of fifteen. In 1946, he adopted the name Bai Hua (&quot;White Birch&quot;), taking it from a Russian poem. Many of his poems appeared in the &quot;Southern Henan Daily&quot;. Subsequently, he joined the People&#x27;s Liberation Army in 1947 and the Chinese Communist Party in 1949. He worked for the Party as a writer specialized in Chinese ethnic minorities, and visited the areas where they lived. From 1952, he was employed by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army as head of a creative writing group based in Kunming, and worked as secretary of Marshal He Long.

In the mid-1950s, his support of disgraced art critic Hu Feng led him to be investigated and detained for eight months, during which he attempted to commit suicide. Charges against him were dropped in 1956.

He was labeled a &quot;rightist&quot; in 1957, and expelled from the Army and the Party in 1958. He had to work in a factory before being hired as a scriptwriter by Haiyian Film Studios in Shanghai and came back to the army in 1964. He was further marginalized during the Cultural Revolution. After 1976, he was able to publish dramas and novels that were mildly critical of the Cultural Revolution.

He produced several influential dramas and films in the late 1970s and early 1980s. From 1985 to the mid 1990s he was a member of the Shanghai Writers&#x27; Association. He was the first intellectual to be denounced again as &quot;rightist&quot; after the Cultural Revolution. His most recent poetry, following a long silence, was published in 2009.

== &quot;Unrequited Love&quot; ==
Some of his plays were banned because they dealt with the political purges and murders in the Red Army that took place in the 1930s and offered a critical view of traditional patriotic values. Among these the most famous was the film script &quot;Unrequited Love&quot; (1979), which became a movie by director Peng Ning, &quot;The Sun and the People&quot; (, 1980) that was never shown to the public. In 1982, the script was used for the Taiwanese movie &quot;Portrait of a Fanatic&quot;. In his script, Bai depicted an overseas Chinese painter who returned to China in order to devote his life to his motherland but ended up suffering political persecution and death. The painter&#x27;s daughter asked her father a highly sensitive question in the film: &quot;You love your motherland, but does the motherland love you?&quot;

The paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was annoyed by Peng Ning&#x27;s film and personally organized the old guards to launch a political campaign against Bai in the national media for his violation of Deng&#x27;s political dogma (specifically the leadership of the party). The criticism threatened to become another wave of political prosecution until the General Secretary of the party Hu Yaobang interfered on his behalf. The significance of this episode is that it effectively split the party into two camps. Bai was later allowed to visit Japan and Southeast Asia and delivered public speeches, but his works were generally suppressed. His late epic poem &quot;From Qiu Jin to Lin Zhao&quot; was never published.

== Personal life ==
Bai married Wang Bei, a Chinese actress, and lived in retirement in Shanghai with his wife.

Bai died on 15 January 2019.

<text>Coimbra (, , , ) is a city and a municipality in Portugal. The population of the municipality at the 2021 census was 140,796, in an area of .
The fourth-largest agglomerated urban area in Portugal after Lisbon, Porto, and Braga, it is the largest city of the district of Coimbra and the Centro Region. About 460,000 people live in the Região de Coimbra, comprising 19 municipalities and extending into an area of .

Among the many archaeological structures dating back to the Roman era, when Coimbra was the settlement of Aeminium, are its well-preserved aqueduct and cryptoporticus. Similarly, buildings from the period when Coimbra was the capital of Portugal (from 1131 to 1255) still remain. During the late Middle Ages, with its decline as the political centre of the Kingdom of Portugal, Coimbra began to evolve into a major cultural centre. This was in large part helped by the establishment of the first Portuguese university in 1290 in Lisbon and its relocation to Coimbra in 1308, making it the oldest academic institution in the Portuguese-speaking world. Apart from attracting many European and international students, the university is visited by many tourists for its monuments and history. Its historical buildings were classified as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 2013: &quot;Coimbra offers an outstanding example of an integrated university city with a specific urban typology as well as its own ceremonial and cultural traditions that have been kept alive through the ages.&quot;

==History==
===Roman Republic===

The city, located on a hill by the Mondego River, was called &quot;Aeminium&quot; in Roman times. The Romans founded the civitas of Aeminium in this place at the time of Augustus (63 BC – AD 14), which came under the protection of nearby Conímbriga (in Condeixa-a-Nova), some to the south. The Roman city was encircled by a wall, and followed an orthogonal plan, with the cardo maximus and decumanus maximus crossing at the Forum. An aqueduct existed, the remains of which were incorporated into a latter medieval renovation. Aeminium fell under the influence, administratively, of the larger city of &quot;Conímbriga&quot;, until the latter was sacked by the Sueves and Visigoths between 465-8 and abandoned. It became the seat of a diocesis, replacing Conímbriga.

Although Conímbriga had been administratively important, Aeminium affirmed its position by being situated at the confluence of the north-south traffic that connected the Roman Bracara Augusta (Roman name of Braga) and Olisipo (Roman name of Lisbon) with its waterway, which enabled connections with the interior and coast. The limestone table on which the settlement grew has a dominant position overlooking the Mondego, circled by fertile lands irrigated by its waters. Vestiges of this early history include the cryptoporticus of the former Roman forum (now part of the Machado de Castro National Museum). The move of the settlement and bishopric of Conimbriga to Aeminium resulted in the name change to &quot;Conimbriga&quot;, evolving later to &quot;Colimbria&quot;.

===Suebi, Alans and Visigoths===
After being subjected to the Roman Empire for a long time, a deluge of barbarians flooded the Iberian Peninsula in 409, and the Lower Mondego area recognised Hermeric, the landlord of the Suebi, as its ruler. But the ambition to gain territory dominated Ataces, king of the Alans and Coimbra fell from the hands of Hermeric. Ataces, the new lord of Coimbra, depopulated and devastated it fearing the security of its fortresses. Delighted, however, with the beauty of Lower Mondego, and with the easiness of its fields, he laid beside it the foundations for a new city which was called &quot;Colimbria&quot;. Ataces converted to Christianity, but being arian by sect persecuted catholics with ferocity. The prisoners were either beheaded before the walls of the new city, their bodies serving as foundations, or employed like cargo donkeys in its edification. Nobody escaped the tyranny of Ataces: he ordered everyone to work on the construction of the walls. Elipando, the holy Bishop of Coimbra was also there holding the stone and the clay for the works of the city. “Passing by the new Coimbra (says Arisberto, Bishop of Porto, writing to Samerico, Archbishop of Braga), there I saw working in the construction of their walls many Ministers of God; among them, at the orders of Ataces, was also Bishop Elipando: I cried with them for their misfortune and for the loss of this fertile province of the Roman Empire.” Hermeric of the northern Kingdom of the Suebi, whose the capital was Bracara Augusta (former name of Braga), did not lose hope of rescuing the lands that had been taken by Ataces in the south. He crossed the Douro river and appeared with his army before the new walls of Coimbra. But Ataces triumphed and followed Hermeric&#x27;s retreating army to the banks of Douro, further north, where the Suebi landlord would buy from him, in exchange for his daughter, peace and an alliance. Ataces, crowned with the laurels of victory continues with great fervor the reedification of the city he had plundered before. Hermeric visited him in Colimbria bringing him her daughter, princess Cindazunda, who had been flourishing in age and beauty. Ataces, in order to show his gratitude had the picture of his new wife placed in a vase, with a serpent on one side and a lion walking towards her on the other. Those were the insignias of Ataces (lion) and Hermeric (serpent). Cindazunda had her eyes lifted up the sky and her hands raised as if thanking the Eternal for having been the medium between the father and the husband and having united with bonds of peace and friendship the serpent and the lion, up until that moment, enemies. As the walls and towers of the city were being built, the workers carved on the stones this insignia so pleasant to the King, that until today, has been the coat of arms of Coimbra. Cindazunda, professing Catholicism, established the bonds of peace between the two kings and improved the fortunes of the inhabitants of Coimbra mitigating the ferocious spirit of Ataces against the catholics. The Visigoths would conquest the region later. During the Visigothic era (from the 5th to the early 8th century), the County of Coimbra was created by king Wittiza (c. 687 – probably 710) and it was a sub-county of his dominion, established as a fief for his son prince Ardabast (or Sisebuto), with its seat in &quot;Emínio&quot; (the Visigothic name for Coimbra), which persisted until the Muslim invasion from the south.

===Islamic Era===
The first Muslim campaigns that occupied the Iberian Peninsula occurred between 711 and 715, with Coimbra capitulating to Musa bin Nusair in 714. Although it was not a large settlement, Qulumriyah (), in the context of Al-Andalus, was the largest agglomerated centre along the northern Tagus valley, and its principal city boasted a walled enclosure of 10 hectares, supporting between 3000 and 5000 inhabitants. Remnants of this period include the beginnings of the Almedina, Arrabalde and the fortified palace used by the city&#x27;s governor (which was later converted into the Royal Palace by the early Portuguese monarchs). The Christian Reconquista forced the Banu Dānis and the other Muslims to abandon the region temporarily. Successively the Moors retook the castle in 987–1064 and again in 1116, capturing two castles constructed to protect the territory: in Miranda da Beira (where the garrison was slaughtered) and in Santa Eulália (where the governor surrendered his forces rather than facing a similar massacre).

===Middle Ages===

The reconquest of the territory was attained in 1064 by King Ferdinand I of León and Castile, who appointed Dom Sisnando Davides to reorganize the economy and administer the lands encircling the city. The County of Portucale and the County of Coimbra were later integrated into one dominion under the stewardship of Henry of Burgundy by Alfonso VI of León and Castile in 1096, when Henry married Alfonso&#x27;s illegitimate daughter Theresa. Henry expanded the frontiers of the County, confronting the Moorish forces, and upon his death in 1112, Theresa, Countess of Portucale and Coimbra, unified her possessions. Their son, Afonso Henriques, who took up residence in the ancient seat of the Christian County of Coimbra, sent expeditions to the south and west, consolidating a network of castles that included Leiria, Soure, Rabaçal, Alvorge and Ansião.

During the 12th century, Afonso Henriques administered an area of fertile lands with river access and protected by a fortified city, whose population exceeded 6000 inhabitants, including magnates, knights and high clergy. The young Infante encouraged the construction of his seat, funding the Santa Cruz Monastery (the most important Portuguese monastic institution at the time, founded in 1131 by Theotonius), promoted the construction of the Old Cathedral, reconstructed the original Roman bridge in 1132, and repaired and renovated fountains, kilns, roads and stone pavements, as well as the walls of the old city. In order to confirm and reinforce the power of the &quot;concelho&quot; (municipality) he conceded a formal foral (charter) in 1179.

Already in the Middle Ages, Coimbra was divided into an upper city (&quot;Cidade Alta&quot; or &quot;Almedina&quot;), where the aristocracy and the clergy lived, and the merchant, artisan and labour centres in the lower city (&quot;Arrabalde&quot; or &quot;Cidade Baixa&quot;) by the Mondego River, in addition to the old and new Jewish quarters. The city was encircled by a fortified wall, of which some remnants are still visible like the Almedina Gate (&quot;Porta da Almedina&quot;).

Meanwhile, on the periphery, the municipality began to grow in various agglomerations, notably around the monasteries and convents that developed in Celas, Santa Clara, Santo António dos Olivais. The most important work in Gothic style in the city is the Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha, founded on the left side of the river Mondego by Queen Elizabeth of Portugal in the first half of the 14th century. It stood too close to the river, and frequent floods forced the nuns to abandon it in the 17th century, when the Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Nova was built uphill. The Queen&#x27;s magnificent Gothic tomb was also transferred to the new convent. The ruins of the old convent were excavated in the 2000s, and can be seen today on the left bank of the river.

===Renaissance===

In the 15th and 16th centuries, during the Age of Discovery, Coimbra was again one of the main artistic centres of Portugal thanks to both local and royal patronage. Coimbra bishops, religious orders and King Manuel I supported artists like Diogo Pires (father and son), Marcos Pires, João de Castilho, Diogo de Castilho and the Frenchmen, João de Ruão and Nicholas of Chanterene, among others, who left important Manueline and Renaissance works in the town. Dating from this period are the remodelling (in Manueline style) of the Santa Cruz Monastery, including the tombs of Kings Afonso Henriques and Sancho I, the Renaissance Manga Fountain, and the altarpieces and triumphal portal of the Old Cathedral, among other works.

The University of Coimbra, was founded as a Studium Generale in Lisbon in 1290 by King Dinis I. The University was relocated to Coimbra in 1308, but in 1338 King D. Afonso IV returned the University to Lisbon. The University was definitively transferred to the premises of Coimbra Royal Palace in 1537 by King John III, and expanded by 1544 to occupy the Coimbra Royal Palace. Since then, city life has revolved around the state-run university. For many decades, several colleges (&quot;colégios&quot;) established by the religious orders provided an alternative to the official institution, but were gradually discontinued with the secularization of education in Portugal. Built in the 18th century, the Joanina Library (&quot;Biblioteca Joanina&quot;), a Baroque library, is another notable landmark of the ancient university. The Baroque University Tower (&quot;Torre da Universidade&quot;) designed by António Canevari and built between 1728 and 1733, is an iconic monument of the city.

=== Baroque and modern ===
In 1772, the Marquis of Pombal, prime minister of King José I, undertook a major reform of the university, where the study of the sciences assumed vast importance. The collections of scientific instruments and material acquired then are now gathered in the Science Museum of the University of Coimbra, and constitute one of the most important historical science collections in Europe. However, his desire to modernize the university resulted in the complete demolition of Coimbra&#x27;s medieval city walls and castle, very little of which remains today. In the same year, Luísa de Jesus, a local 23-year-old woman, was sentenced to death for multiple infanticide becoming the last woman to be executed in the country&#x27;s history. She is also considered the deadliest serial killer in Portuguese crime history.

The first half of the 19th century was a difficult period for Coimbra, being invaded by French troops under the command of Andoche Junot and André Masséna during the Peninsular War. A force of 4,000 Portuguese militia led by Nicholas Trant dealt Masséna a heavy blow when it recaptured the city on 6 October 1810. In March 1811, the militia successfully held the place against the retreating French army. The city recovered in the second half of the 19th century with infrastructure improvements like the telegraph, gas light, the railway system, a railway bridge over the Mondego River and the renovation of the Portela bridge, in addition to the broadening of roads and expansion of the city into the Quinta de Santa Cruz.

By 1854, with the expulsion of the religious orders and municipal reforms, the need to reorganize the municipality of Coimbra forced some changes in the existing structure of the administrative divisions. Consequently, documents were sent (on 20 January 1854) to the Ministries of Ecclesiastical Affairs () and Justice () urging the identification by the Civil Governor and Archbishop of Coimbra (Manuel Bento Rodrigues) of the number of civil parishes to preserve, their limits, the political organs to be retained, a local census and other statistics to justify the demarcation of the territory. A commission of five members, which included João Maria Baptista Callixto, António dos Santos Pereira Jardim, Roque Joaquim Fernandes Thomás, João Correia Ayres de Campos and António Egypcio Quaresma Lopes de Carvalho e Vasconcelos, was appointed to produce a plan to reduce, suppress, demarcate and establish civil parishes in the city of Coimbra and its suburbs.

===Republic===
On 1January 1911, electric tramways were inaugurated to connect the old quarter with its expanding periphery, which included the residential areas of Celas, Olivais, Penedo da Saudade and Calhabé, all located in the civil parish of Santo António dos Olivais. This was only the initiation of the municipality growth. Civil construction projects throughout the region marked the economic activity of the territory, with new areas such as Montes Claros, Arregaça, Cumeada and Calhabé growing in the shadow of the city. Even projects that had been planned at the end of the 19th century gained new initiative, including the expansion of the Santa Cruz neighbourhood (&quot;bairro&quot;), the demolition of the residential area of the Alta de Coimbra (1940–50) to expand the university, and construction or expansion of the bairros of Celas, Sete Fontes and Marechal Carmona (now the bairro of Norton de Matos).

==Geography==

One of the nation&#x27;s most important crossroads, Coimbra was historically at a junction between Braga and Lisbon, and its river access (the Mondego flows through the municipality) provided a route between the interior communities and the coastal towns (including the seaside city of Figueira da Foz, west of Coimbra). The historic city of Coimbra is located centrally within the municipality, connected to Lisbon () and Porto () by the IC2, IP3 and A1 motorways.

The municipality is circled by several of its neighbouring municipalities in the Região de Coimbra, which include Penacova (in the northeast), Vila Nova de Poiares (to the east), Miranda do Corvo (to the southeast), Condeixa-a-Nova (to the south and southwest), Montemor-o-Velho (to the west), Cantanhede (to the northwest) and Mealhada (in the north and northeast). Just outside the municipality, there are also several picturesque mountain towns such as Lousã and Penacova, while spa towns and villages, such as Luso, Buçaco and Curia are commonplace.

Although it ceased serving as the capital of Portugal in the 13th century, Coimbra retains considerable importance as the centre of the former Beira province, now designated the Centro region. It is considered alongside Braga one of the two most important regional centres in Portugal outside the Lisbon and Portos metropoles, the centre for the whole middle region of the country. With a dense urban grid, the municipality is known primarily for the city of Coimbra, itself famous for its monuments, churches, libraries, museums, parks, nightlife, healthcare and shopping facilities. Above all, its cultural life, oriented around the University of Coimbra, has historically attracted the nation&#x27;s notable writers, artists, academics and aristocracy, securing its reputation as the &quot;Lusa-Atenas&quot; (Lusitanian Athens).

===Ecoregions/protected areas===

The western edge of Coimbra is covered by the &quot;Reserva Natural do Paul de Arzila&quot; (&quot;Arzila Swamp Natural Reserve&quot;), which is designated both as a &quot;Special Protection Zone&quot; () and &quot;Special Conservation Zone&quot; (), coincident with the civil parish of Arzila (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Paul de Arzila&quot; or &quot;marsh of Arzila&quot;). It is a wetland that has sheltered migratory birds, and supports other animal and plant species; this has included predominantly avian species, such as the: Eurasian reed warbler (&quot;Acrocephalus scirpaceus&quot;), sedge warbler (&quot;Acrocephalus schoenobaenus&quot;), melodious warbler (&quot;Hippolais polyglotta&quot;), willow warbler (&quot;Phylloscopus trochilus&quot;), little bittern (&quot;Ixobrychus minutus&quot;), great reed warbler (&quot;Acrocephalus arundinaceus&quot;), and the Savi&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Locustella luscinioides&quot;). The 482 hectare area, under threat from industrial, residential and agricultural pollution, expansion of aquatic plants and eutrophication, has forced the governmental reorganization of land use in order to promote models of sustainability, and rural use that does not affect the migratory and aquatic bird populations.

The municipal government has also promoted the installation and maintenance of various parks, playgrounds, gardens and forests, including the development of the Botanical Garden of the University of Coimbra (considered the fifth oldest in the world), the &quot;Mata Nacional do Choupal&quot;, the &quot;Mata Nacional de Vale de Canas&quot;, &quot;Jardim da Sereia&quot; (also known as &quot;Santa Cruz Garden&quot;), &quot;Penedo da Saudade&quot;, &quot;Parque Manuel Braga&quot;, &quot;Parque Verde do Mondego&quot;, &quot;Choupalinho&quot;, and the 19th century Quinta das Lágrimas estate and gardens.

Complementing these natural spaces are the riverside parks and bathing areas that line the Mondego, including the river beaches of Palheiros do Zorro, in the parish of Torres do Mondego.

The city is on the Portuguese Way of the Road of St James (Caminho de Santiago).

===Climate===
Coimbra has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;) in a transition to a hot-summer (&quot;Csa&quot;) version of the interior of Central Portugal. 

In winter, temperatures range between at day and at night, occasionally dropping below , with an average of 19 days with frost per year; while summer temperatures range between at day and at night and can reach or more in hotter days. Coimbra has around 32 days a year with maximum temperatures above . The lowest and highest temperatures ever recorded in Coimbra were on 27 January 1976 and .

Precipitation is abundant throughout the year, except for July and August.

Despite being relatively distant from the coast, Coimbra also has a marked Atlantic influence due to the floodplain of the Mondego River which crosses the city, making both its winters and summers milder than they would otherwise be. This influence also makes cold waves less frequent and less intense, however, days with negative minimum temperatures and cold waves are still present occasionally. Topography is also an important factor to consider in regard to nighttime temperatures, the presence of cold air lakes, in topographically depressed areas at certain synoptic situations, can also lead to pronounced colder temperatures.


===Human geography===
Administratively, the municipality is divided into 18 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Almalaguês
* Antuzede e Vil de Matos
* Assafarge e Antanhol
* Brasfemes
* Ceira
* Cernache
* Coimbra (Sé Nova, Santa Cruz, Almedina e São Bartolomeu)
* Eiras e São Paulo de Frades
* São João do Campo
* São Martinho de Árvore e Lamarosa
* São Martinho do Bispo e Ribeira de Frades
* São Silvestre
* Souselas e Botão
* Santa Clara e Castelo Viegas
* Santo António dos Olivais
* Taveiro, Ameal e Arzila
* Torres do Mondego
* Trouxemil e Torre de Vilela
As of 2021, the municipality of Coimbra had a population of 140,796 inhabitants (covering an area of 319.4 km2), reflecting just a 1.3% increase relative to 1991 (139,052 residents), while the number of families increased 17.1% in the same period. This was mainly concentrated in the parish of Sé Nova, while the remaining administrative divisions accounted for a range of 78.54 to 5069.2 inhabitants per kilometre square. Seniors and youth (age 0 to 14 years) represent a minority of the population (16.5% and 31.1%); the 25 to 64 cohort accounts for 55% of the active population. While per 100 inhabitants, seniors actually comprise 21.6% of this population, the birth rate (9.3%) is superior the mortality rate in the communities of Coimbra, which is actually greater than other municipalities in the Baixo Mondego subregion.

The municipality of Coimbra has a resident population of 157,510 inhabitants, and seasonal population of approximately 200,000 residents. Between 1864 and 2001, the municipal population tripled (following the trend in the rest of the country when the nation&#x27;s population doubled), while between 1991 and 2001 its population increased 6.75% (Portugal&#x27;s population increased 4.08% in the same period). On average, over 43,000 people flow to Coimbra every day to study and work. About 460,000 inhabitants live in the Região de Coimbra, consisting of 19 municipalities comprising a territory of .

Internally, the network and location of public service/sector institutions (such as police stations, fire stations, public finance and notary services) have been located within of the resident population, while most tertiary shops and retail capture between 43.4% and 100% of the market. Mini-markets and corner shops cover 100% of the population; generally, the longest distance travelled between shops is (for pastry shops). Restaurants are usually within 74.2% of the population, and refreshment shops (such as bars and snack bars) routinely cover 100% of the market. Commerce and vestuary shops range from coverage of 43.4% (for glasses) to 91.4% (of clothing); the largest distance that resident population requires to travel is for electro-domestics and auto-mobile purchases. Repair services, which cover the largest part of the civil parishes, and specifically auto repair shops, cover 97.1% of the market. Public transport covers 90.3% of the parishes, with 93.5% of the population; 61.3% have taxi services (capturing 78.8% of the population); public buses serve 67.7% of the parishes (or 85% of the population); while rail services affect 35.5% of the parishes (serving 29.7% of the market); while unequipped parishes, on average, lie within of such services. Postal services are provided in 15 parishes (48.4%), corresponding to 77.9% of the population, while 98.6% receive home distribution. Similarly, public telephones have a 94.6% coverage of the population.

==Economy==
The wealth of the city rests mostly on the University of Coimbra with about 28,000 students – the city has a total of over 38,000 higher education students considering the other higher education institutions based there – but also in shopping, technology and health sciences industry, administrative offices, financial services, law firms and specialised medical care. The city has many private clinics, medical offices and two large state-run hospital centres: the &quot;H.U.C. – Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra&quot;, which is a university hospital, and the &quot;C.H.C. – Centro Hospitalar de Coimbra&quot;, which includes a general hospital. Coimbra has also the regional branch of the national cancer hospital – the &quot;I.P.O. – Instituto Português de Oncologia&quot;, as well as a military hospital. The Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal, the state-run forensic science institute of Portugal, is headquartered in Coimbra.

Notable companies based in the municipality of Coimbra include software companies Critical Software and Ciberbit which have their global headquarters in the city, mechanical and electronics engineering company Active Space Technologies, data science company Feedzai, telemetry and Machine to Machine company ISA, Cimpor&#x27;s cement factory in Souselas (CIMPOR Souselas), the pan-European service facility of Olympus Corporation, the pharmaceuticals companies Bluepharma and BASI, the iron foundry Fucoli-Somepal and several ceramics, food processing (Probar produces cold meat products and Dan Cake produces sponge cakes and swiss rolls), textiles, wine, civil and engineering construction, architecture, public works and housing construction firms. Handicraft industry is well represented by traditional tapestry and pottery manufacture, and the surroundings of the city have besides forestry, dynamic horticulture production, vineyards and livestock raising. The &quot;Instituto Pedro Nunes&quot; (Pedro Nunes Institute), a business incubator, dynamically hosts several start-ups which are usually dedicated to technology-related businesses and become independent spin-off companies headquartered across the whole region. There is a move by municipal authorities to bring in more innovation and high-technology businesses, through initiatives such as the Coimbra Innovation Park, with the objective of promoting innovation and companies that promote research and development (such as nanotechnology company Innovnano, a subsidiary of Companhia União Fabril).

Coimbra has a fresh produce open-air market on every 7th and 23rd days of the month at &quot;Feira dos 7 e dos 23&quot;, and a large fresh produce market in downtown at &quot;Mercado D. Pedro V&quot;. The &quot;Baixa&quot; (downtown) of Coimbra has many coffeehouses and bakeries, and features several specialty shops selling all kind of products in typical old-fashioned architectural surroundings. Large commercial facilities with car park, include a medium-sized shopping centre (&quot;CoimbraShopping&quot;); two larger shopping centres with hypermarket, restaurants, movie theaters and several shops with a selection of some of Portugal&#x27;s and the world&#x27;s most famous and stylish international brands include the Alma shopping center (formerly called Dolce Vita Coimbra) designed by the American planning and design firm, Suttle Mindlin and &quot;Forum Coimbra&quot;; and two retail parks found on the fringes of the city, offering an alternative to the busy city centre (&quot;Retail Park Mondego&quot; in Taveiro, and &quot;Coimbra Retail Park&quot; in Eiras). Dolce Vita Coimbra (renamed Alma) was the recipient of the 2006 MIPIM International Design Award; the 2006 ICSC International Design Award; and the 2006 ICSC European Design Award.

==Transportation==
The two banks of Mondego River at Coimbra, are linked by three main bridges: the &quot;Ponte do Açude&quot;, the &quot;Ponte de Santa Clara&quot; (which is the oldest) and &quot;Ponte Rainha Santa&quot;, also known as &quot;Ponte Europa&quot;. The &quot;Ponte Pedonal de Pedro e Inês&quot; is the most recently constructed bridge and the only footbridge in the city.

The city is internally connected by an extensive bus network, the SMTUC (&quot;Serviços Municipalizados de Transportes Urbanos de Coimbra&quot;, Coimbra Municipality Urban Transport Services) and the Coimbra trolleybus system (the only such system in Portugal). In the past, the city also had a tram network (some are now parked inside a transportation museum). Taxicabs are also available, and are recognizable as cream or black and green (black car with green rooftop) taxis. The city is a hub for interregional bus services for all the country and abroad. A light-rail metro system, Metro Mondego, was proposed however the project was abandoned at the height of Portuguese financial crisis.

Coimbra has several rail stations. The principal station &quot;Coimbra-B&quot; is on the main line between Porto and Lisbon. In addition, the train-hotel Lusitania connects Coimbra and Madrid every night.

From this station, a small spur runs to &quot;Coimbra-A&quot;, the main station in the city centre. A small regional rail line (&quot;Linha da Lousã&quot;) also ran from &quot;Coimbra Parque&quot; at the south edge of the city centre. From Coimbra-Parque was possible to travel to Miranda do Corvo, Lousã and Serpins, among others. The line was closed for upgrading as part of the Metro Mondego project and was never reopened when the Metro Mondego project was abandoned, but there is local pressure for the line to be reopened. It is also possible to travel by train between Coimbra and Figueira da Foz (&quot;Ramal de Alfarelos&quot;), and Coimbra, Guarda and Vilar Formoso (&quot;Linha da Beira Alta&quot;).

Coimbra is served by the A1 motorway, which connects Lisbon to Porto.

A regional aerodrome is in Cernache (&quot;Aeródromo Municipal Bissaya Barreto&quot;) (CBP) [PCO], southwest of the centre. With a runway and flight information service until sunset, this regional airport has all the fundamental facilities for private flights.

The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Coimbra, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 35 min. 2.4% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

==Education==
Coimbra has been called &quot;A cidade dos estudantes&quot; (The city of the students) or &quot;Lusa-Atenas&quot; (Lusitan-Athens), mainly because it is the site of the oldest and one of the largest universities in Portugal – the University of Coimbra, a public university whose origins can be traced back to the 13th century. Nowadays, it has students from 70 different nationalities; almost 10% of its students are foreigners, making it Portugal&#x27;s most international university.

Coimbra is also the place where the oldest and biggest university students&#x27; union of Portugal was founded – the &quot;Associação Académica de Coimbra&quot; (Academic Association of Coimbra), established in 1887.

As well, there are some other schools and institutes of higher education in the city: the &quot;Instituto Politécnico de Coimbra&quot;, a public polytechnic institute; the &quot;Escola Superior de Enfermagem de Coimbra&quot;, a public nursing school; and some private higher education institutions such as the &quot;Instituto Superior Miguel Torga&quot;; the &quot;Instituto Superior Bissaya Barreto&quot;; the &quot;Escola Universitária Vasco da Gama&quot; and finally, the &quot;Escola Universitária das Artes de Coimbra&quot;, an art school.

A large number of higher education students from all of Portugal chose Coimbra&#x27;s higher learning institutions to study, due to the wide availability of degrees offered in different fields, the student-friendly environment of the city, and the prestige of many of its learning institutions allied to the ancient tradition of Coimbra as the historical capital of higher studies in Portugal.

The city has also a large number of public and private basic and secondary schools, among these some of the best-ranked in the country, like &quot;Escola Secundária Infanta D. Maria&quot; (public), &quot;Escola Secundária José Falcão&quot; (public), &quot;Escola EB2/3 Martim de Freitas&quot; (public), &quot;Colégio Rainha Santa Isabel&quot; (private) and &quot;Colégio de São Teotónio&quot; (private), as well as several kindergartens and nurseries. There is also the Coimbra Hotel and Tourism School.

More than 1,000 young people are expected to attend in the first year at TUMO Coimbra.

The project is made possible through the initiative of some based in or nearby Coimbra sponsors such as Critical Software, Paulo Marques and Pedro Bizarro (founders of Feedzai), Licor Beirão and Coimbra City Council.

===Coimbra fado===
The &quot;Fado de Coimbra&quot; is a highly stylised genre of &quot;fado&quot; music originated in Coimbra. Among its most notable and historical adherents are guitarist Carlos Paredes and singer Zeca Afonso, while the &quot;Orfeon Académico de Coimbra&quot; (the oldest and most famous academic choir in Portugal) and the &quot;Associação Académica de Coimbra&quot; are important organizations that promote the culture and stylings of this subgenre of music. In addition, Coimbra has a contemporary music, boasting several live music venues, and some of the most popular clubs and music festivals in Portugal. Moreover, the &quot;Conservatório de Música de Coimbra&quot;, musical departments of the Associação Académica de Coimbra and the music programmes of the Faculty of Letters are noted by many of top music schools in the country.

The &quot;Orfeon Académico de Coimbra&quot; is an autonomous organization of the students&#x27; union &quot;Associação Académica de Coimbra&quot;, established in 1880 by a law student of the University of Coimbra (UC), and the &quot;fado&quot; section of UC&#x27;s &quot;Associação Académica de Coimbra&quot; itself, are important organizations in Coimbra fado promotion and preservation.

According to tradition, to applaud fado in Lisbon one would clap his hands, while in Coimbra cough as if clearing the throat is the typical way.

===Student festivals===
Coimbra is also known for its university students&#x27; festivals. Two are held every year. The first one, &quot;Latada&quot; or &quot;Festa das Latas&quot; (&quot;The Tin Can Parade&quot;) is a homecoming parade that occurs at the beginning of the academic year, and is a welcome to the new university students (&quot;Caloiros&quot;).

The &quot;Festa das Latas&quot; goes back to the 19th century when the Coimbra students felt the need to express their joy at finishing the school year in as loud a way as possible, using everything at their disposal that would make noise, namely tin cans. The highlight of this festival, which now takes place at the beginning of the academic year (November) is the special parade known as the &quot;Latada&quot;. After marching through the streets of the city the new students are &quot;baptised&quot; in the Mondego River thus entering into the Coimbra academic fraternity. The students from the penultimate year, normally the 3rd year&#x27;s students, are awarded their &quot;Grelos&quot; (a small ribbon). The &quot;Grelo&quot; is a small, woollen ribbon with the colour (s) of the student&#x27;s faculty that is attached to a student&#x27;s briefcase. Previous to this, at the morning the students must have visited the Dom Pedro V market where they must get a turnip to sustain the &quot;Caloiros&quot; during the day&#x27;s festivities. Besides the tin cans they have tied to their legs, the new students wear all kinds of costumes made up according to the creativity and imagination of their &quot;godmothers&quot; or &quot;godfathers&quot; who are older students. They also carry placards with ironic criticisms alluding to certain teachers, the educational system, national events and leaders.

The second one, &quot;Queima das Fitas&quot; (&quot;The Burning of the Ribbons&quot;), takes place at the end of the second semester (usually in the beginning of May) and it is one of the biggest student parties in all Europe. It lasts for eight days, one for each University of Coimbra&#x27;s Faculty: &quot;Letras&quot; (Humanities), &quot;Direito&quot; (Law), &quot;Medicina&quot; (Medicine), &quot;Ciências e Tecnologia&quot; (Sciences and Technology), &quot;Farmácia&quot; (Pharmacy), &quot;Economia&quot; (Economics), &quot;Psicologia e Ciências da Educação&quot; (Psychology and Education Sciences) and &quot;Ciências do Desporto e Educação Física&quot; (Sports Sciences and Physical Education).

Although being University of Coimbra&#x27;s festivals, other higher education students of Coimbra such as the polytechnic&#x27;s students or private institution&#x27;s students, are invited every year by the University of Coimbra students who manage and organise this events, to participate in the &quot;Tin Can Parade&quot; and also in the &quot;Burning of the Ribbons&quot;. The academic festivities are opened to the entire city community and attract a large number of national and international tourists as well.

===Music acts===
Coimbra has a lively music scene that caters for most tastes with many festivals and events beyond the academic festivals, the traditional Coimbra fado genre and Artur Paredes, Adriano Correia de Oliveira and Zeca Afonso&#x27;s musical heritage. It boasts several live music venues, and some of the most popular club nights and music festivals in Portugal. Moreover, the Conservatório de Música de Coimbra, the music-related departments of the Associação Académica de Coimbra and the music programmes of the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Coimbra are regularly cited among the top music schools in the country. Modern bands and artists with some degree of recognition in the Portuguese music scene include André Sardet, The Legendary Tigerman, JP Simões (from Belle Chase Hotel and Quinteto Tati) and Os Quatro e Meia. Lux Records, a Portuguese independent record label founded by Rui Ferreira in 1996, is based in Coimbra and has produced the works of many noteworthy music artists and bands of the city since then, including Belle Chase Hotel and The Legendary Tigerman.

<text>Howard University is a private, historically black, federally chartered research university in Washington, D.C., United States. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; and accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

Established in 1867, Howard is a nonsectarian institution located in the Shaw neighborhood. It offers undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees in more than 120 programs.

==History==

===19th century===
Shortly after the end of the American Civil War, members of the First Congregational Society of Washington considered establishing a theological seminary for the education of black clergymen. Within a few weeks, the project expanded to include a provision for establishing a university. Within two years, the university consisted of the colleges of liberal arts and medicine. The new institution was named for General Oliver Otis Howard, a Civil War hero who was both the founder of the university and, at the time, commissioner of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. Howard later served as president of the university from 1869 to 1874.

The U.S. Congress chartered Howard on March 2, 1867, and much of its early funding came from endowment, private benefaction and tuition. (In the 20th and 21st centuries, an annual congressional appropriation, administered by the U.S. Department of Education, funds Howard University and Howard University Hospital.)

Many improvements were made on campus. Howard Hall was renovated and made a dormitory for women.

===20th century===

From 1926 to 1960, preacher Mordecai Wyatt Johnson was Howard University&#x27;s first African-American president.

The Great Depression years of the 1930s brought hardship to campus. Despite appeals from Eleanor Roosevelt, Howard saw its budget cut below Hoover administration levels during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

In the 1930s, Howard University still had segregated student housing.

Howard University played an important role in the Civil Rights Movement on a number of occasions. Alain Locke, chair of the Department of Philosophy and first African American Rhodes Scholar, authored &quot;The New Negro&quot; (1925), which helped to usher in the Harlem Renaissance. Ralph Bunche, the first Nobel Peace Prize winner of African descent, served as chair of the Department of Political Science. Beginning in 1942, Howard University students pioneered the &quot;stool-sitting&quot; technique of occupying stools at a local cafeteria which denied service to African Americans, blocking other customers waiting for service. This tactic was to play a prominent role in the later Civil Rights Movement. By January 1943, students had begun to organize regular sit-ins and pickets around Washington, D.C. at cigar stores and cafeterias which refused to serve them because of their race. These protests continued until the fall of 1944.

Stokely Carmichael, also known as Kwame Toure, a student in the Department of Philosophy and the Howard University School of Divinity, coined the term &quot;Black Power&quot; and worked in Lowndes County, Alabama as a voting rights activist. Historian Rayford Logan served as chair of the Department of History. E. Franklin Frazier served as chair of the Department of Sociology. Sterling Allen Brown served as chair of the Department of English.
The first sitting president to speak at Howard was Calvin Coolidge in 1924. His graduation speech was entitled, &quot;The Progress of a People&quot;, and highlighted the accomplishments to date of African-Americans since the Civil War. His concluding thought was, &quot;We can not go out from this place and occasion without refreshment of faith and renewal of confidence that in every exigency our Negro fellow citizens will render the best and fullest measure of service whereof they are capable.&quot;

In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson delivered a speech to the graduating class at Howard, where he outlined his plans for civil rights legislation and endorsed aggressive affirmative action to combat the effects of years of segregation of blacks from the nation&#x27;s economic opportunities. At the time, the voting rights bill was still pending in the House of Representatives.

In 1975, the historic Freedman&#x27;s Hospital closed after 112 years of use as Howard University College of Medicine&#x27;s primary teaching hospital. Howard University Hospital opened that same year and continues to be used as HUCM&#x27;s primary teaching hospital, with service to the surrounding community.

Also in 1975, Jeanne Sinkford became the first female dean of any American dental school when she was appointed as the dean of Howard University&#x27;s school of dentistry.

In 1989, Howard gained national attention when students rose up in protest against the appointment of then-Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater as a new member of the university&#x27;s board of trustees. Student activists disrupted Howard&#x27;s 122nd-anniversary celebrations, and eventually occupied the university&#x27;s administration building. Within days, both Atwater and Howard&#x27;s President, James E. Cheek, resigned.

===21st century===
In April 2007, the head of the faculty senate called for the ouster of Howard University President H. Patrick Swygert, saying the school was in a state of crisis, and it was time to end &quot;an intolerable condition of incompetence and dysfunction at the highest level.&quot; This came on the heels of several criticisms of Howard University and its management. The following month, Swygert announced he would retire in June 2008. The university announced in May 2008 that Sidney Ribeau of Bowling Green State University would succeed Swygert as president. Ribeau appointed a Presidential Commission on Academic Renewal to conduct a year-long self-evaluation that resulted in reducing or closing 20 out of 171 academic programs. For example, they proposed closing the undergraduate philosophy major and African studies major.

Six years later, in 2013, university insiders again alleged the university was in crisis. In April, the vice chairwoman of the university&#x27;s board of trustees wrote a letter to her colleagues harshly criticizing the university&#x27;s president and calling for a vote of no confidence; her letter was subsequently obtained by the media where it drew national headline. Two months later, the university&#x27;s Council of Deans alleged &quot;fiscal mismanagement is doing irreparable harm,&quot; blaming the university&#x27;s senior vice president for administration, chief financial officer and treasurer and asking for his dismissal. In October, the faculty voted no confidence in the university&#x27;s board of trustees executive committee, two weeks after university president Sidney A. Ribeau announced he would retire at the end of the year. On October 1, the Board of Trustees named Wayne A. I. Frederick interim president. In July 2014 Howard&#x27;s Board of Trustees named Frederick as the school&#x27;s 17th president.

In May 2016, President Barack Obama delivered a commencement address at Howard University encouraging the graduates to become advocates for racial change and to prepare for future challenges.

In 2018, nearly 1,000 students held a sit-in demanding injunction over the administration&#x27;s use of funding, after a Medium post revealed that six university employees had been fired for &quot;double dipping&quot; financial aid and tuition remission. The university had discovered the fraud the previous year, but had not publicly disclosed the loss; 131 individuals were involved in some form, with the top 50 recipients accounting for 90% of the total, and the five most reimbursed individuals receiving $689,375 in refunds. After the student protest ended, faculty voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in the university president, chief operating officer, provost, and board of trustees. The nine-day protest ended with university officials promising to meet most of their demands. It also led to an investigation by the Department of Education, which placed the university on &quot;heightened cash monitoring&quot;, an increased form of scrutiny relating to the disbursement of student financial aid. This monitoring status was rescinded in December of the following year.

In July 2020, philanthropist MacKenzie Scott donated $40 million (~$ in ) to Howard. Her single donation is the largest in Howard&#x27;s history.

In May 2021, the university announced that the newly re-established college of fine arts, led by Dean Phylicia Rashad, would be named the Chadwick A. Boseman College of Fine Arts for the actor and distinguished alum who from his days as a student in the late 1990s through his death from cancer in 2020 led protests against the 1997 absorption of the College of Fine Arts into the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.

In October 2021, a group of students protested the mold, mice, and substandard conditions in campus residential buildings in the Blackburn Takeover, demanding an improvement in the living situation and representation on the board of trustees. In 2023, Howard University issued a $300 million tax-exempt bond to tackle the housing woes, as part of a $785 million investment to renovate and construct academic centers. 

In March 2022, Howard University announced that it will spend $785 million over the next four years to construct new STEM complex, academic buildings to house the Chadwick Boseman School of Fine Arts, and the Cathy Hughes School of Communications, as well as renovate other buildings on campus.

In 2023, Howard University was selected by the Department of the Air Force to lead a research center on tactical autonomy technology for military systems.

In February 2025, Howard University made history becoming the first HBCU to achieve Research One (R1) Carnegie Classification.

==Campus==
The campus, often referred to as &quot;The Mecca&quot;, is in northwest Washington, D. C.

Major improvements, additions and changes occurred at the school in the aftermath of World War I. New buildings were built under the direction of architect Albert Cassell.

Howard University has several historic landmarks on campus, such as Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel, Frederick Douglass Memorial Hall, and the Founders Library.

The Howard University Gallery of Art was established by Howard&#x27;s board of trustees in 1928. The gallery&#x27;s permanent collection has grown to over 4,000 works of art and continues to serve as an academic resource for the Howard community.

Howard University has eight residence halls for students: Drew Hall (freshmen), College Hall North (freshwomen), The Harriet Tubman Quadrangle - &quot;Quad&quot; (freshwomen), Cook Hall (freshmen), Bethune Annex (co-ed, continuing students), Plaza Towers West (co-ed, continuing students), College Hall South (co-ed, continuing students), The Axis (co-ed, continuing students), Mazza Grandmarc (co-ed, continuing students), WISH-Woodley Park (co-ed, continuing students) and Plaza Towers East (co-ed, continuing students).

<text>Sant Dnyaneshwar (Marathi pronunciation: ), also referred to as Dnyaneshwar, Dnyanadeva, Dnyandev or Mauli or Dnyaneshwar Vitthal Kulkarni (1275–1296), was a 13th-century Indian Marathi saint, poet, philosopher and yogi of the Nath and Varkari tradition. In his short life of 21 years, he authored &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; (a commentary on the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;) and &quot;Amrutanubhav&quot;. These are the oldest surviving literary works in the Marathi language, and considered to be milestones in Marathi literature. Sant Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s ideas reflect the non-dualistic Advaita Vedanta philosophy and an emphasis on Yoga and bhakti towards Vithoba, an incarnation of Vishnu. His legacy inspired saint-poets such as Eknath and Tukaram, and he is one of the founders of the Varkari (Vithoba-Krishna) Bhakti movement tradition of Hinduism in Maharashtra. Dnyaneshwar undertook samadhi at Alandi in 1296 by entombing himself in an underground chamber.

==Biography==
Dnyaneshwar was born in 1275 (on the auspicious day of Krishna Janmashtami) in a Marathi-speaking Deshastha Brahmin family in Apegaon village on the banks of Godavari river near Paithan in Maharashtra during the reign of the Yadava king Ramadevarava. The kingdom with its capital Devagiri enjoyed relative peace and stability, and the king was a patron of literature and arts.

Biographical details of Sant Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s life are preserved in the writings of his disciples, Satyamalanath and Sachchidanand. The various traditions give conflicting accounts of details of Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s life. The date of composition of his work &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; (1290 CE), however is undisputed. According to the more accepted tradition on Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s life, he was born in 1275 CE and he attained samadhi in 1296 CE. Other sources state he was born in 1271 CE.

===Life===
The biographical details of Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s short life of about 21 years are well established. The available accounts are filled with hagiographic legends and miracles he performed, such as his ability to make a buffalo sing the Vedas and humble a yogi by riding a moving wall.

According to the accounts that have survived, Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s father Vitthal pant was the kulkarni (hereditary accountant, usually Brahmin, who maintained land and tax records in villages) of a village called Ape gaon on the banks of the Godavari River in Maharashtra, a profession he had inherited from his ancestors. He married Rakhna Bai, the daughter of the Kulkarni of Alandi. Even as a householder, Vitthal pant longed for spiritual learning. His disillusionment with life grew as a result of the death of his father and because he had no children from his marriage. Eventually, with his wife&#x27;s consent, he renounced worldly life and left for Kashi to become a sannyasin (renunciate). According to another version of these events Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s father Vitthalapant came from a long line of teachers of the Nath yogi sect and being deeply religious, he went on a pilgrimage to Varanasi. There he met a &quot;guru&quot; (spiritual teacher), decided to renounce without his wife&#x27;s consent.

Vitthalapant was initiated by his spiritual teacher, Ramashrama (according to abhanga of Saint Namdeva), in Kashi. When Ramashrama Swami visited Alan-di and met Rukminibai by chance, he blessed her saying, &quot;“May you lead a happy married life.”&quot; With tears in her eyes, Rukmini said that it was not possible since her husband had gone away to Kashi and become a sanyasin. On finding out that her husband was none other than his disciple Vitthalapant, Swami, on returning to Kashi, reprimanded Vitthalapant and sent him back to Alandi. At Alandi, he rejoined his wife and again became a householder. After Vitthalapant returned to his wife and settled down in Alandi, Rakhumabai gave birth to four children—Nivruttinath (1273 CE), Dnyaneshwar (1275 CE), Sopan (1277 CE) and Muktabai (1279 CE).

Orthodox Brahmins of the day saw a renunciate returning to his life as a householder as heresy. Dnyaneshwar and his brothers were denied the right to have the sacred thread ceremony for the full admission to the Brahmin caste. According to Pawar, this meant excommunication from the Brahmin caste.

Vitthalapant eventually left the town for Nashik with his family. One day while performing his daily rituals, Vitthalapant came face to face with a tiger. Vitthalapant and three of his four children escaped, but Nivruttinath became separated from the family and hid in a cave. While hiding in the cave he met Gahaninath, who initiated Nivruttinath into the wisdom of the Nath yogis. Later, Vitthalapant returned to Alandi and asked the Brahmins to suggest a means of atonement for his sins; they suggested giving up his life as penance. Vitthalapant and his wife gave up their lives, within a year of each other by jumping into the Indrayani river in the hope their children might be able to lead lives free of persecution. Other sources and local folk tradition claim that the parents committed suicide by jumping in the Indrayani River. Another version of the legend states that Vitthalapant, the father threw himself into Ganges River to expiate his sin.

Dnyaneshwar and his siblings were accepted by and initiated into the Nath Hindu live tradition to which their parents already belonged, where the three brothers and the sister Muktabai all became celebrated yogis and Bhakti poets.

===Travel and demise===
After Dnyaneshwar had written Amrutanubhav, the siblings visited Pandharpur where they met Namdev, who became a close friend of Dnyaneshwar. Dnyaneshwar and Namadev embarked on a pilgrimage to various holy centers across India where they initiated many people into the Varkari sect; Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s devotional compositions called Abhangas are believed to have been formulated during this period. On their return to Pandharpur, Dnyaneshwar and Namadev were honored with a feast in which, according to Bahirat, many contemporary saints such as &quot;Goroba the potter, Sanvata the gardener, Chokhoba the untouchable and Parisa Bhagwat the Brahmin&quot; participated. Some scholars accept the traditional view that Namdev and Dnyaneshwar were contemporaries; however, others such as W. B. Patwardhan, R. G. Bhandarkar and R. Bharadvaj disagree with this view and date Namdev to the late 14th century instead.

After the feast, Dnyaneshwar desired to go into &quot;sanjeevan samadhi&quot;, a practice to voluntarily leave one&#x27;s mortal body after entering into a deep meditative state, as practiced in Ashtanga Yoga of ancient India. Preparations for the Sanjeevan Samadhi were made by Namdev&#x27;s sons. Regarding Sanjeevan Samadhi, Dnyaneshwar himself had emphatically talked about the relationship between higher awareness and light or pure energy. On the 13th day of the dark half of the Kartik month of the Hindu Calendar, in Alandi, Dnyaneshwar, who was then twenty-one years old, entered into &quot;Sanjeevan samadhi&quot;. His &quot;samadhi&quot; lies in the Siddhesvara Temple complex in Alandi. Namdev and other bystanders grieved his death. According to tradition, Dnyaneshwar was brought back to life to meet Namdev when the latter prayed to Vithoba for his return. Dallmayr writes that this testifies to &quot;the immortality of genuine friendship and companionship of noble and loving hearts&quot;. Many Varkari devotees believe that Dnyaneshwar is still alive.

===Miracles===

There are a few stories about miracles came to be associated with Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s life, one of which was the revival of his disciple Sachchidanand&#x27;s corpse. Fred Dallmyr summarizes one of these legends as follows from the hagiography by Mahipati: At age 12, Dnyaneshwar with his impoverished and outcaste siblings, went to Paithan to plead mercy from Paithan priests. There, they were insulted and ridiculed. As the children were suffering the bullying, on a nearby road was a man who was violently lashing an old buffalo, and the injured animal collapsed in tears. Dnyaneshwar asked the buffalo owner to stop out of concern for the animal. The priests ridiculed him for being more concerned about a beast and unconcerned about the teachings of the Vedas. Dnyaneshwar retorted that the Vedas themselves held all life to be sacred and a manifestation of the &quot;Brahman&quot;. The outraged priests pointed out that his logic implied that beasts should be able to learn the Vedas as well. An undeterred Dnyaneshwar then placed his hand on the buffalo&#x27;s forehead and it started reciting a Vedic verse in a deep voice. According to Fred Dallmayr, one may not be concerned whether this story accurately reflects Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s biography, the story does have symbolic significance in the same manner as the story about Jesus in Jerusalem in Matthew 3:9.

In another miracle, Dnyaneshwar was challenged by Changdev, an accomplished yogi who rode on a tiger with his magical powers, to replicate this feat. Dnyaneshwar humbled Changdev by riding on a moving wall. Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s advice to Changdev was given in 65 verses called the &quot;Changdev Pasasthi&quot;. Changdev became a disciple of Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s sister Muktabai.

==Writings==
According to B. P. Bahirat, Dnyaneshwar was the first known philosopher who wrote in the Marathi language. At about age 16, he composed Dnyaneshwari in the year 1290, a commentary on Bhagavad Gita which later became a fundamental text of the Varkari sect. His words were recorded by Sacchidananda, who agreed to become Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s amanuensis. &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; was written using the &quot;Ovi&quot;; a metre, which was first used to compose women&#x27;s songs in Maharashtra, of four lines where the first three or the first and third lines rhyme and the fourth line has a sharp and short ending. According to W. B. Patwardhan, a scholar on Dnyaneshwar, with Dnyaneshwar the &quot;ovi&quot; &quot;trips, it gallops, it dances, it whirls, it ambles, it trots, it runs, it takes long leaps or short jumps, it halts or sweeps along, it evolves a hundred and one graces at the master&#x27;s command&quot;.
In Dnyaneshwari, at last he wrote &quot;Pasaayadana&quot; in which he prayed everything for others and all humanity and nothing for himself. Saint Dnyaneshwar himself believed that &quot;The whole world has one soul- या विश्वाचा आत्मा एक आहे&quot;.
His first text &quot;Dnyanesvari&quot; was in the vernacular Marathi language, as opposed to the classical Sanskrit language. He wrote Dnyaneshwari in the Marathi language so that common people could understand philosophical aspects of life which were then understood only by those who knew Sanskrit (i.e. the higher priestly classes). Thus, this was a significant work in Indian history which simplified philosophy to the common man.

According to Bhagwat, like other Bhakti poets, Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s choice of the vernacular language was an important departure from the prevailing cultural hegemony of Sanskrit and high–caste Hinduism, a trend which continued with later &quot;bhakti&quot; poets across India. Dnyaneshwar is to the Marathi literature what Dante is to the Italian, states Bhagwat.

According to tradition, Nivruttinath was not satisfied with the commentary and asked Dnyaneshwar to write an independent philosophical work. This work later came to be known as &quot;Amrutanubhava&quot;. Scholars differ on the chronology of the &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; and Amrutanubhav. Patwardhan has argued that &quot;Amrutanubhav&quot; is an earlier text than &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; because the latter is richer in use of metaphors and imagery, and displays greater familiarity with many different philosophical systems, such as Samkhya and Yoga. However, both Bahirat and Ranade disagree with this view pointing out that in &quot;Amrutanubhava&quot;, author displays familiarity with involved philosophical concepts such as &quot;Mayavada&quot; and &quot;Shunyavada&quot;, and while the text has simpler language, it reveals Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s &quot;philosophical depth&quot;.

Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s devotional compositions called Abhangas are believed to have been formulated during his pilgrimage to Pandharpur and other holy places when he got initiated into the Varkari tradition.

===Influences===

The Mahanubhava sect and the Nath Yogi tradition were two prominent movements during Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s time that influenced his works. Mahanubhavas were devotees of Krishna who disregarded the caste system, the Vedas and the worship of the deity Vitthala. Dnyaneshwar differed significantly from Mahanubhava&#x27;s religious precepts. His thought was founded on the philosophy of the later Vedic texts such as the Upanishads and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, and devotion to Vitthala formed the cornerstone of the egalitarian Varkari sect founded by Dnyaneshwar. However, the literary style adopted by Mahanubhava writers influenced Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s works. According to R. D. Ranade, Dnyaneshwar &quot;stands to Mahanubhavas just in the same relation which Shakespeare stood to Elizabethan writers&quot;.

Dnyaneshwar was initiated into the Nath Yogi tradition by his brother Nivruttinath, sometime after the death of their parents; Sopana and Muktabai were initiated into the tradition by Dnyaneshwar himself. Founded by Gorakshanath, the Nath Yogi sect had introduced the system of &quot;Hatha Yoga&quot;, which emphasised on yogic poses and physical fitness. Gahaninath, a disciple of Gorakshanath, had initiated Nivruttinath into the Nath Yogi tradition. Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s non-dualistic philosophy, usage of a vernacular language in his writing and an emphasis on yoga and oneness of Vishnu and Shiva were his inheritances from the Nath Yogi tradition.

The values of Universal brotherhood and compassion espoused in his works came from his interactions with the devotional Vitthala sect, a tradition which was already in existence during Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s time. J. N. Farquhar also notes the influence of &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; on Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s poetry.

==Philosophy==
===Ontology and epistemology===

Dnyaneshwar takes up the examination of being or brahman in &quot;Amrutanubhava&quot;. He considers being to be the substratum of thought which enables thought and cognition. Since being is prior to thought and concepts, it is distinct from Kantian categories, and methods of thought such as epistemological analysis cannot be applied to it. Dnyaneshwar believes that reality is self–evident and does not require any proof. It antedates dualistic divisions into knower and known, existence and nonexistence, subject and object, knowledge and ignorance.

Dnyaneshwar highlights the limitations of the traditional epistemological methods (&quot;pramanas&quot;) used in Indian philosophy. He points out that any perception is validated only by another deeper understanding, while in establishing the rationality of reason, reason itself is transcended. Dnyaneshwar even cautions against reliance on scriptural testimony, which is accepted as a valid source of knowledge by philosophers of Vedanta and Mīmāṃsā schools of philosophy. Scriptural validity, to him, stems from its congruence with experiential truth and not vice versa.

===Ethics===
Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s moral philosophy comes out in his exposition of the 13th of &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, in his commentary on the book &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot;. He considers humility; non–injury in action, thought and words; forbearance in the face of adversity; dispassion towards sensory pleasures; purity of heart and mind; love of solitude and devotion towards one&#x27;s Guru and God as virtues; and their corresponding moral opposites as vices. A pessimistic view of one&#x27;s life is considered as a necessary condition for spiritual growth in &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot;. Dnyaneshwar writes that saints do not perceive distinctions and are humble because they identify all objects, animate or inanimate, with their own Self.

Devotion to Guru occupies an important place throughout the commentary. Many of its chapters begin with an invocation to his Guru Nivruttinath, who is eulogized by Dnyaneshwar as the person who helped him &quot;cross the ocean of existence&quot;. The discussion on virtue and vices continues in his elucidation of the 16th chapter of &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, where virtues and vices are called divine heritages and demonic heritages respectively. Divine heritage comprises fearlessness, which comes from a belief in unity of all objects; charity; sacrifice, which comes from performing one&#x27;s duties and compassion in addition to virtues already enumerated; while demonic heritage consists of six vices— ignorance, anger, arrogance, hypocrisy, harshness and pride.
The doctrine of Karma Yoga in the Bhagavad Gita is resurrected in &quot;Dnyaneshwari&quot; and its utility as a means of achieving actionlessness through action and in establishing harmony between the two is examined. In the fourth chapter, the ideal &quot;karma yogi&quot;″s actions are compared to the apparent movement of the Sun, which while appearing to rise and set is actually stationary; similarly, a &quot;karma yogi&quot;, though appears to act, doesn&#x27;t really act. Performance of one&#x27;s duties, acting without egoism, renunciation of the fruits of one&#x27;s actions and offering one&#x27;s actions to God are four ways which, according to Dnyaneshwar, result in actionlessness and Self–realisation. Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s metaphysical conclusion that the world is a manifestation of the divine, and not an illusion, also creates an ethical framework which rejects renunciation and recommends performing one&#x27;s duties and actions in the spirit of worship.

Traditional Indian scriptures see &quot;Ṛta&quot;, a Hindu theological term similar to &quot;dharma&quot;, as a natural law that governs both the cosmos and human society. Performance of one&#x27;s duties to uphold social institutions, such as marriage and family, thus becomes imperative, and duty overrides individual freedom. Dnyaneshwar is in agreement with tradition; he believes that divine order and moral order are one and the same and are inherent in the universe itself. He, therefore, recommends that all social institutions be protected and preserved in their totality. However, when it comes to the institution of caste, his approach becomes more humanitarian and he advocates spiritual egalitarianism.

==Reception and legacy==

Elements of Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s life and writings, such as his criticism of parochialism of the priestly elite, a celebration of the family life and spiritual egalitarianism, would shape the culture of the Varkari movement. According to Dallmayr, Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s life and writings have &quot;developed into primary exemplars of genuine religiosity for the Varkari movement, as well as crucial sources and focal points of &quot;bhakti&quot; devotion&quot;.

Devotees of the Varkari sect in the Hindu Shaka month of Ashadh join an annual pilgrimage called the Wari with symbolic Sandals (called Paduka in Marathi) of Dynaneshwar carried in a palkhi from Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s shrine in Alandi to the Vitthala temple in Pandharpur . The &quot;Padukas&quot; (sandals) of Dnyaneshwar are carried in a &quot;Palkhi&quot; (palanquin) for the Dnyaneshwar inspired works of later poet-saints of the Varkari movement.

His philosophy of &quot;chidvilas&quot; was adapted by Varkari writers, such as Namdev and Eknath, to their own works. &quot;Amrutanubhava&quot;″s influence is visible in Eknath&#x27;s &quot;Hastamalak&quot; and &quot;Swatmsukha&quot;. Tukaram&#x27;s works imbibe and explain Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s philosophical concepts such as the refutation of &quot;Mayavada&quot;.

==In popular culture==
A 1940 Marathi film, Sant Dnyaneshwar, directed by Vishnupant Govind Damle and Sheikh Fattelal, was a biopic on Sant Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s life. Since 2021, a Marathi language TV serial named &#x27;Dnyaneshwar Mauli&#x27; is airing on the Sony Marathi channel.

<text>Neue Deutsche Welle (NDW, , &quot;New German Wave&quot;) is a genre of West German rock music originally derived from post-punk and new wave music with electronic influences. The term was first coined by Dutch radio DJ Frits Ritmeester on the popular nationwide radio station Hilversum 3, which was very popular among German listeners. Soon after that, the term was used in a record-shop advertisement by Burkhardt Seiler in an August 1979 issue of the West German magazine &quot;Sounds&quot;. It was then used by journalist Alfred Hilsberg in an article about the movement titled (&quot;New German Wave — From Grey Cities&#x27; Walls&quot;) in &quot;Sounds&quot; in October 1979.

== History ==

The history of the Neue Deutsche Welle consists of two major parts. From its beginnings to 1981, the genre was mostly an underground movement with roots in British punk and new wave music. It quickly developed into an original and distinct style, influenced in no small part by the different sound and rhythm of the German language, which many of the bands had adapted from early on. Whilst some of the lyrics of artists like Nena and Ideal epitomized the zeitgeist of urban West Germany during the Cold War, others used the language in a surreal way, merely playing with its sound or graphic quality rather than using it to express meaning, as done by bands and artists such as Spliff, Joachim Witt and Trio.

The main centers of the NDW movement during these years were West Berlin, Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Hanover and Hagen, as well as, to a lesser extent, the Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region, Limburg an der Lahn and Vienna.

From about 1980 on, the music industry began noticing the Neue Deutsche Welle; however, because of the idiosyncratic nature of the music, focus shifted to creating new bands more compatible with the mainstream rather than promoting existing bands. Many one-hit wonders and short-lived bands appeared and were forgotten again in rapid succession. The overly broad application of the NDW label to these bands, as well as to almost any German musicians not using English lyrics, even if their music was apparently not influenced at all by the original NDW sound (including pure rock bands like BAP or even Udo Lindenberg), quickly led to the decay of the entire genre when many of the original musicians turned their backs in frustration.

A revival of interest in the style in the Anglophone world occurred in 2003, with the release of DJ Hell&#x27;s compilation &quot;New Deutsch&quot;. The NDW has come to be acknowledged as a forerunner to later developments in dance-punk, electronic body music and electroclash.

<doc id="378123" wikidata="Q523777" url="?curid=378123" title="Chrysler 300 letter series">
<text>The Chrysler 300 &quot;letter series&quot; are high-performance personal luxury cars that were built by Chrysler in the U.S. from 1955 to 1965 and were a sub-model from the Chrysler New Yorker. After the initial year, which was named C-300 for its standard FirePower V8, the 1956 cars were designated 300B. Successive model years were given the next letter of the alphabet as a suffix (skipping &quot;i&quot;), reaching the 300L by 1965, after which the model sequence was discontinued while the &quot;300&quot; remained. At its introduction it was advertised as &quot;America&#x27;s Most Powerful Car&quot;.

The 300 &quot;letter series&quot; cars were among the vehicles built by Chrysler after World War II that focused on performance, and thus can be considered the beginning of the muscle car, though full-sized and more expensive. Chrysler had a long history of producing race car products going back to the Chrysler Six that was entered in the 1925 24 Hours of Le Mans, 1928 24 Hours of Le Mans, 1929 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the Chrysler Imperial Eight roadster in the 1931 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 1955 C-300 and the 1956 300B were raced with very little modification at NASCAR races to include Watkins Glen International where it won races multiple times.

The automaker reintroduced the 300 designations again for performance-luxury sedans in 1999, using the 300M nameplate from 1999 to 2004, and expanding the 300 series with a reintroduction of a new Hemi-engineered V8 installed in the 300C, the top model of a new Chrysler 300 line, a new rear-wheel drive car launched in 2004 for the 2005 model year.
== First generation ==
=== 1955 C-300 ===
This first of the letter series cars did not bear a letter, but can retroactively be considered the &#x27;300A&#x27;. The &#x27;C-&#x27; designation was applied to all Chrysler models and the coupe was built on the C-68 New Yorker Series. For marketing purposes the car was called the &quot;300&quot; in order to further reinforce the engine installed. The C-300 was a racecar aimed at the NASCAR circuits that was sold for private ownership to qualify for homologation purposes, with Chrysler&#x27;s most powerful engine, the OHV FirePower &quot;Hemi&quot; V8, due to the hemispheric shape of the cylinder head, fitted with dual four barrel carburetors, two overhead valves per cylinder with solid valve lifters, a race-profiled camshaft installed inside the engine cylinder block, stiffer front and rear suspension, and a low restriction performance exhaust system. This engine was exclusive to the 300, the New Yorker and the all-new Imperial Newport. By 1956, this would be the first American production car to top , and the letter series was for many years the most powerful car produced in the United States. The engine and transmission were shared with the French automaker Facel Vega in the Facel Vega Excellence and the Cunningham C-4R which was entered at the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans and finished the race. With the growing popularity of European sports cars during the late 1940s, Chrysler sought to create a &quot;drivers car&quot; with sports car performance but with greater attention to comfort. in the growing post-WWII tradition of grand tourers.

The car&#x27;s &quot;100-Million Dollar Look&quot; styling can be attributed as much to the Chrysler parts bin as designer Virgil Exner. The front clip, including the grille, was taken from the Imperial of the same year, but the rest of the car did not look like an Imperial. The midsection was from a New Yorker hardtop, with a Windsor rear quarter. Exner also included base-model Chrysler bumpers and removed many exterior elements such as back-up lights, hood ornament, side trim, and exterior mirrors. An electric clock and two-speed windshield wipers were standard. There were few options available including selection of three exterior colors of Black, Tango Red or Platinum White and only one color of tan leather interior. Power windows and power front seat adjustment were available but air conditioning was not available in 1955.

Measured at in the Flying Mile, and doing well in NASCAR, the C-300 aroused interest that was not reflected in its modest sales figure of 1,725, and the listed retail price of US$4,100 ($ in dollars ).

When the C-300 competed in NASCAR, it was painted to advertise that it was the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest stock car&quot;. In February 1954 the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL was introduced and sold in North America and was labeled the fastest production car of its time. The Chrysler C-300 was also introduced at the same time the BMW 503 was introduced and sold in North America. The Bentley Continental with a similar approach to driving experience was introduced in 1952.

=== 1956 300B ===
The 1956 300B was fairly similar externally, distinguished by a new tailfin treatment, but with larger engines, and a choice of two versions of the Hemi V8 producing either , with a 10:1 compression ratio used to achieve the higher horsepower rating. A companion of this generation was introduced as the DeSoto Adventurer and the Dodge D-500 that were less luxurious, while still sharing much of the mechanicals, giving DeSoto and Dodge a performance enhanced model, while the 354 CID engine was exclusive to the 300, New Yorker and Imperials. The TorqueFlite transmission controls were to the left of the steering wheel and a total of 1,102 were sold. Performance was better than the previous year&#x27;s by its top speed at almost at the Daytona Flying Mile. A 6.17 ratio rear differential was also added to the options. Front leg room was 44.6 inches. New was the Highway Hi-Fi phonograph player. This was the last year that coil springs were used for the front suspension.

With the optional 10:1 compression ratio, brake horsepower became from the same engine, and the 300B became the first American car to produce 1 horsepower per cubic inch, besting Chevrolet with their fuel-injected by one year. Colors were updated to Regimental Red, Cloud White and Black while the tan leather interior remained.

NASCAR team owner Carl Kiekhaefer&#x27;s raced the 300B, among other cars, and won 22 out of 41 races, including 16 races consecutively; One of his racers was famous racer Buck Baker, who drove 300B&#x27;s. Kiekhaefer would purchase cars from Chrysler and modify a few appearance features but essentially raced the cars as they were, with leather interior and other standard features, on the racetrack. The listed retail price was $4,242 ($ in dollars ).


== Second generation ==
=== 1957 300C ===
The 1957 model year 300C was corporately shared with an all new appearance for Chrysler products called the &quot;Forward Look&quot; and featuring a &quot;yawning&quot; wide trapezoid-shaped front grille which was unique to the 300C, &quot;Vista-Dome&quot; windshield, dual headlights, and gradually rising tailfins starting from the doors similar to Chrysler-branded products. The wheel diameter changed from to while continuing to use drum brakes for all wheels, and to keep the front brakes cool a cooling duct was installed with the air intake located just below the headlights that fed air directly to the front brakes. The exterior color list was expanded to offer Jet Black, Parade Green metallic, Copper Brown metallic, Gauguin Red and Cloud White while the interior was tan leather standard and optional interior choices were available from the New Yorker list of which the 300 was based.

The Hemi engine was upgraded to with , or as a limited edition version (18 built). The 392 CID engine was exclusive to the 300, New Yorker and Imperials, while the dual four barrel carburetors was standard on the 300C and continued with an improved air induction system that gave each carburetor its own air cleaner to improve efficiency. A convertible model was available for the first time and was listed at US$5,359 ($ in dollars ) while the two-door hardtop was listed at US$4,929 ($ in dollars ). In comparison, a 1957 Imperial Crown Convertible was listed at US$5,598 ($ in dollars ). GM&#x27;s Pontiac Division introduced the Pontiac Bonneville as a convertible only, offering fuel injection and a similar price tag but offered lower luxury content and a reduced price for 1958, and Mercury offered the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser for 1957 with the optional &quot;Super Marauder&quot; V8.

The car introduced red, white, and blue &#x27;300C&#x27; circular medallions on the sides, hood, trunk, and interior and was the first model to use the color scheme, and despite the late-1950s design trends that added ever increasing amounts of chrome, styling flourishes, intricate grilles and interior appearance features the styling of the 300C and subsequent generations remained minimal. A total of 1,918 coupes and 484 convertibles were built. All Chrysler products introduced the all-new torsion bar front suspension, called Torsion-Aire, which replaced the previous coil spring front suspension and the new Airtemp air-conditioner, a $495 option, was offered ($ in dollars ).


=== 1958 300D ===
The 1958 model year was to be the last use of the FirePower Hemi in the 300. The engine was still , but tuned to as standard, while the 392 CID engine was exclusive to the 300 and Imperials. Thirty-five cars were built with an extremely rare option called the Bendix &quot;Electrojector&quot; fuel injection, with which the V8 was rated at . Due to reliability problems with the primitive onboard computer which controlled the injection system, however, vehicles installed with the fuel injection option were recalled and retrofitted with dual four barrel carburetors. Cars that were originally installed with the fuel injection had a special &quot;300D&quot; badge attached to the rear fender with additional &quot;fuel injection&quot; script included.

Due to the 300D continuing to be a sub-model of the New Yorker, luxury amenities were included. Standard items were leather upholstery, power assist steering, power assist brakes, power window lifts, dual remote adjustable side view mirrors, power adjustable driver seat, &quot;Air-Temp&quot; air-conditioning, power deploying radio antenna, tinted glass, rear window defroster, windshield washer, Limited-slip differential, Hi-Fi Phonograph, and &quot;Auto-Pilot&quot; cruise control. The exterior color list was updated to offer Raven Black, Aztec Turquoise, Mesa Tan, Tahitian Coral, Matador Red and Ermine White while the interior was tan leather standard and optional interior choices were available from the New Yorker list of which the 300 was based.

A 300D was driven to at the Bonneville Salt Flats that year, and another was driven at the Daytona Flying Mile, producing a quarter-mile time of 16 seconds at . A total of 618 hardtops and 191 convertibles were produced, in part due to a recession, competition from the Ford Thunderbird and the listed retail price of US$5,173 ($ in dollars ) for the hardtop and US$5,603 ($ in dollars ) for the convertible. The 300D saw a new luxurious competitor from Mercury called the Park Lane.

=== 1959 300E ===
The 1959 model year saw the Hemi engines replaced by Chrysler&#x27;s new Golden Lion wedge-head V8 at displacement (which Chrysler called &quot;lion-hearted&quot;), and remained exclusive to the 300 and Imperials. Power output remained about the same at while the engine weight dropped by and production costs were reduced. This model was the last year of body on frame chassis. Total sales included 522 coupes and 125 convertibles and the front grille and exterior styling retained the previous years appearance instead of adopting the corporate Chrysler appearance shared with Imperial for 1959. A small &quot;300&quot; badge was installed on the left side of the grille perpendicular to the headlights, while the grille was updated to narrow horizontal red bars highlighted by four chrome bars in place of the previous eggcrate grille and only appeared for 1959. New for 1959 was the installation of Goodyear Blue Streak bias-ply tires on 14 in wheels which are now classified as Vintage Racing tires.

Attention to detail was evident in the standard features included. The instrument cluster continued the tradition of easy-to- read gauges with two large circular gauges with an engine turned, sometimes also called perlée appearance. The left cluster contained the odometer and a speedometer that went to , while the right side contained an ammeter, fuel gauge, oil pressure indicator, and water temperature gauges. A clock with a sweeping second hand is installed between the two directly centered to the steering column. Power adjustable swivel seats were standard but were synchronized to the opening of the door while accommodating a traditional six-way power adjustable split front bench seat, with a new &quot;Natural Tan&quot; leather upholstery feature called &quot;Living Leather&quot; that used a basket-weave pattern to promote air circulation in warm weather, while optional interior choices were available from the New Yorker list of which the 300 was based. The exterior color list was updated to offer Formal Black, Turquoise Grey metallic, Cameo Tan metallic, Copper Spice metallic, Radiant Red and Ivory White. The listed retail price continued to climb to US$5,319 ($ in dollars ) for the hardtop and US$5,749 ($ in dollars ) for the convertible.


== Third generation ==
=== 1960 300F ===
The 1960 model offered a &quot;Cross-Ram&quot; version of the Wedge Head V8 introduced in 1959. To boost power at lower and mid rpms, a special intake manifold was derived. Instead of the normal V8 central intake manifold with carburetor(s) on top, the cross-ram consisted of two pairs of long tuned pipes that criss-crossed so that each set fed the opposite side of the engine. The carburetors and air cleaners hung off the sides of the engine over the fender wells. These long tubes were tuned so that resonances in the column of air helped force air into the cylinders at those engine speeds.

A special &quot;short ram&quot; version optimized for higher engine speeds was produced for competition. The overall tube length remained at 30&quot;, but the tuned portion of the stacks was only , favoring high RPMs. Only 15 &quot;short ram&quot; cars were produced; these were also fitted with the exotic but often troublesome French manufactured Pont-a-Mousson 4-speed manual transmissions developed for the Chrysler-powered Facel Vega. Approximately 4 of these &quot;Special Gran Turismo&quot; are known to exist, including one convertible and one with air conditioning; it is believed that 15 were originally produced.

Also new were four individual, leather bucket seats for front and rear passengers with a full-length console from dash to rear seatback which had previously been introduced on the Chrysler Norseman concept car of 1956. The rear passenger electric window switches were installed in the center console within easy reach, and bench seats for front and rear passengers were no longer available. The rear bucket seats were also offered on the New Yorker Custom coupe. Swiveling front seats were fitted as standard equipment but were modified to mechanical operation only initiated by the driver and not synchronized to the door when opened. The AstraDome instrument cluster was introduced on all Chrysler products only and featured &quot;Panelescent Lighting&quot; and a tachometer was installed in the center console below the radio due to the complexity of the three dimensional instrument cluster. The exterior color list was shortened to Formal Black, Toreador Red metallic, Alaskan White, and Terra Cotta metallic while the standard interior color remained as tan leather.

The dash had been designed with Chrysler&#x27;s push-button controls for the TorqueFlite automatic in mind, with the &quot;AstraDome&quot; instrument cluster covering the part of the steering column a column shifter would come out from under then-standard practice, so manual cars used a floor shifter. Due to the installation of the &quot;AstraDome&quot; instrument cluster extending outward towards the steering wheel, the traditional installation of the turn signal lever was relocated to the dashboard underneath the &quot;TorqueFlite&quot; pushbutton gear selectors and was installed as a sliding lever that would return to center as the steering wheel returned to the center position. To the right of the steering wheel but left of the radio were pushbutton controls for the ventilation and air conditioning while retaining the use of a lever for temperature control.

The bodywork was also redone for 1960, using Chrysler&#x27;s new lightweight unibody construction and given sharper-edged styling with outward-tilting fins that were visually separated from sides, while the front grille adopted the corporate look used by all Chrysler-branded products, ending a tradition where the 300 had unique styling not shared with other Chrysler branded vehicles. A controversial &quot;Continental&quot;-style trunk lid appeared, shared with the Imperial and was gone for 1961.

Sales increased to 969 coupes and 248 convertibles with a suggested retail price of US$5,411 ($ in dollars ) for the hardtop coupe and US$5,841 ($ in dollars ) for the convertible.

=== 1961 300G ===
The 1961 model saw another restyle. The grille, formerly wider at the bottom than the top, was inverted; the quad headlights, formerly side-by-side, were canted inward at the bottom, in a manner reminiscent of 1958-1960 Lincolns and 1959 Buicks. Small parking lamps below the headlights were likewise slanted and V-shaped, and the front bumper was canted up at each end, scoop-like. At the rear, the taillights were moved from the fins to the tail below them, and the fins were made sharper-pointed. Power windows were standard. The standard equipment rear bucket seats continued with a full-length console from the dashboard along the tunnel containing the driveshaft, and were also offered on the New Yorker Custom coupe.

Mechanically, the cross-ram &quot;short ram&quot; and &quot;long ram&quot; engines remained the same with the dual four barrel carburetors, although the exotic French manual transmission was dropped, and replaced by an exclusive Chrysler-sourced heavy-duty manual transmission (referred to as &#x27;option code 281&#x27;). A 300G would post the highest speed of in the Daytona Flying Mile, and in 1961 speed trials were moved off the beach at Daytona.

The &quot;AstraDome&quot; instrument cluster which was sometimes called the &quot;gumball&quot; or &quot;jukebox&quot; due to its appearance continued to be installed on all Chrysler products for 1961. The exterior color list was updated to Formal Black, Mardi Gras Red, Alaskan White, and Cinnamon metallic while the standard interior color continued as tan leather. To aide in brake cooling, the hubcaps and pressed steel wheels were introduced with slots to allow airflow across the drum brakes. Suggested retail prices continued to climb at US$5,441 ($ in dollars ) for the coupe and US$5,841 ($ in dollars ) for the convertible.


=== 1962 300H ===
From 1962s models, the fins were gone from all Chrysler products, as was the letter series&#x27; unique place in the Chrysler lineup; there was now the new Chrysler 300 Sport Series which came as a two-door hardtop, replacing the cancelled Chrysler Windsor, while the convertible remained with the letter series along with a two-door hardtop 300H. Externally there was little difference between the 300H and the 300 Sport Series except for a &quot;300H&quot; badge on the traditional location on the rear fenders, and many of the 300H&#x27;s standard features could be ordered as options on the Sport Series. The Mercury competitor was the all-new Mercury S-55 with the same approach to luxury and performance in a coupe or convertible and the Buick Wildcat.

Inside, the 300 Sport Series hardtop coupe was installed with standard bench seats front and rear, similar to the Newport, while the 300H had standard bucket seats front and rear with the full length center console, and were also offered on the New Yorker Custom coupe. This was also the last year for the AstraDome Instrument cluster for all Chrysler branded vehicles and the dashboard color now matched the leather upholstery and carpet. The exterior color list was updated to Formal Black, Festival Red, Oyster White, and Caramel while the standard interior color continued as tan leather.

Under the hood of the 300H the cross ram engine became an option, and there was a return to the inline dual 4-barrel carburetor setup of the 300E as the base powerplant. With a slight power boost and a lighter body, due to the 300H being shared with the Chrysler Newport/Dodge Custom 880 122-inch wheelbase which reduced overall weight, the 300H was faster than the 300G, but the loss of exclusivity coupled with high prices made this the slowest-selling letter series year yet, with only 435 coupes and 135 convertibles sold. The 300 Sport Series hardtop sedan used a B engine. Suggested retail prices showed a reduction from the past at US$5,090 ($ in dollars ) for the coupe and US$5,461 ($ in dollars ) for the convertible.


== Fourth generation ==
=== 1963 300J ===
A more formal, angular, so-called &quot;crisp, new custom look&quot; appeared for 1963, ushering in the Chrysler C platform architecture. To avoid confusion with the number one, the letter &quot;I&quot; was skipped over and the first iteration became the &quot;300J&quot;. Shared with the 300 Sport Series, Newport and New Yorker series, this body design featured wide C-pillars, minimized bright trim and was the last one styled during Virgil Exner&#x27;s term as Chrysler&#x27;s styling chief. Medallions featuring CHRYSLER THREE HUNDRED lettering surrounding a large J were mounted on the C-pillars and the rear deck. The standard leather-upholstered interior did away with the swivel feature for the front bucket seats while the previous full-length center console was now limited to the front with the rear compartment reverting to a bench seat. To address quality and reliability concerns, Chrysler in 1963 introduced a five-year/50,000-mile warranty, a business practice that was unheard of by its competitors in the 1960s

The only available engine was the ram-induction V8, with an increase of from 1962; this temporarily re-established the practice of the top-spec engine being standard on the letter series. The redesigned, otherwise low-key interior featured an oddly squared steering wheel, shared with all Chrysler products for that year. The 300J was faster than the standard 300H of the year before, with a top speed, 8.0 seconds 0-60 mph, and a standing quarter mile time of 15.8 seconds with a terminal velocity of . Sales were especially poor, with only 400 cars produced, while the retail price was listed at US$5,184 ($ in dollars ). The exterior color list was updated to Formal Black, Claret Red, Oyster White, Alabaster, and Madison Grey metallic while the standard (and only) interior was Claret Red leather.

The 300 convertible was now demoted to the Sport Series, and was the official pace car for the 1963 Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, and the car could be provided with exterior markings on commercially sold cars, where it was marketed as the 300 Pacesetter, an approach previously used on the 1956 DeSoto Fireflite Pacesetter. Power steering was standard and an addition was made to the TorqueFlite control panel where a &quot;Park&quot; lever was added alongside the control buttons so that when the transmission was placed in neutral the park lever was moved to the bottom to engage the function.

=== 1964 300K ===
The convertible returned for the 1964 300K, but the &quot;cross-ram&quot; engine became an extra-cost option available on the 300K only. A Wedge with a single Carter AFB 3614S 4-barrel carburetor, a regular intake manifold, and was the new standard engine, shared with the Imperial. Leather upholstery was no longer standard, a US$94 option ($ in dollars ), while the list of available exterior colors expanded extensively with contrasting interior color choices in vinyl. The colors available were Formal Black, Wedgewood Blue, Nassau Blue metallic, Monarch Blue metallic, Pine Mist metallic, Sequoia Green metallic, Silver Turquoise metallic, Royal Turquoise metallic, Madison Grey, Rosewood metallic, Royal Ruby metallic, Roman Red, Embassy Gold, Persian White, Dune Beige, Sable Tan metallic, and Silver Mist metallic A mid-year special trim package was the 300K Silver Edition. It was offered only as a 2-door hardtop in Silver Mist metallic paint, a vinyl half-roof that gave a targa top appearance and bucket front seats with a reclining passenger seat. The bucket seats in all cars were redesigned with the result being a thicker, more substantial look.

Previous generations starting in 1955 earned the 300 the reputation of being &quot;the banker&#x27;s hotrod&quot;, but the marketing focus changed due to the 300 Sport Series, and this reduced the baseline price of the 300K by over a thousand dollars, and sales responded with the largest total ever; 3,022 coupes and 625 convertibles, with the coupe available at US$4,228 ($ in dollars ) and the convertible at US$4,694 ($ in dollars ). A center console was standard and distinguished it from the 300 Sport Series coupe. Later in 1964, the Plymouth Barracuda was introduced on the Chrysler A platform which was sold at Chrysler-Plymouth dealerships next to the Chrysler 300K. A visual distinction can be made between the years by the rear tail lights; the 300J has round units while the 300K has trapezoid shaped units. The TorqueFlite pushbutton controls that were installed to the left of the steering wheel were removed and instead a console mounted transmission selector was introduced, while a manual transmission was also available.


== Fifth generation ==
=== 1965 300L ===
The 1965 300L was the eleventh and final model in the traditional letter series. Like every other 1965 Chrysler, it featured a completely restyled body with the crisp lines, slab sides and a tall greenhouse passenger compartment that were introduced by Elwood Engel, successor of Virgil Exner as Chrysler&#x27;s head of styling. It was a linear look and the panoramic windshield that had been used since 1957 was abandoned. The car had grown two inches in wheelbase and three inches in overall length. Both 2-door hardtop (with crease lines in the roof sheetmetal for the then-popular &quot;convertible look&quot;) and 2-door convertible body styles were available. The cross-ram 390 hp engine had been discontinued, leaving the engine with regular inlet manifold, single 4-barrel carburetion, unsilenced air cleaner, special camshaft and dual exhaust as the only engine option. With the introduction of the Chrysler B platform Dodge Coronet and the Plymouth Satellite, the performance coupe tradition was handed off from the 300 and the subsequent letter series model naming convention was discontinued.

Engine output was , as in the previous year. The buyer could choose between the standard 3-speed TorqueFlite automatic and the no-cost option 4-speed manual with Hurst shift linkage. Every feature on the 300L could be ordered as an option on the regular 300; thus, the only difference was the 300L-exclusive ornamentation. This consisted of round &quot;300L&quot; medallions at the center of the die-cast grille star and in the middle of the textured aluminum applique between the taillights, a red-paint-filled full-length beltline molding, and a rectangular die-cast &quot;300&quot; badge on rear fenders.

Tested by car magazine Motor Trend, a TorqueFlite-equipped 300L 2-door Hardtop accelerated from in 8.8 seconds, and covered the quarter mile in 17.3 seconds with a terminal speed of . A total of 2,405 300L hardtops and 440 convertibles were produced.


=== 1966 300M ===
Intending to return the 300 letter series to its roots, Chrysler proposed the 1966 300M as a clay mockup in October 1963. The exterior was similar to the 300L, except the 300M had spinner-type knock off wheel covers with a &quot;300M&quot; medallion in the center, as well as another &quot;300M&quot; medallion on the trunk lid. The front running lights were moved to the center grille bar and the front turn signals were widened. The 300M also had paint stripes along the lower body line instead of the chrome molding found on the non-letter series 300s, &quot;300M&quot; medallions on the sides, script &quot;Three Hundred&quot; badges and unique tail lights and bezels. Three-spoke headlight ornaments were planned, but dropped due to legal issues in some states. The interior was identical to the non-letter series 300 except for the &quot;300M&quot; medallions. The 300M was planned to be powered by the 426 Wedge engine rated at . This first 300M proposal was cancelled in November 1964 &quot;to reduce scheduling and plant complexity&quot;. But in 1965 the 300M was revived, this time powered by the , 426 Hemi engine and a planned production run of 4298, of which 500 were to have the Hemi engine, a $1250 option. The Hemi cars would also feature a dual-faced &quot;7-Liter Hemi&quot; medallion. This proposal was also cancelled as the letter series 300s had lost their prestige and exclusivity as they were simply non-letter series 300s with letter badges. The 300M name would not be used again until 1999.

== Sixth generation ==
=== 1970 Hurst 300 ===
The 1970 &quot;Hurst 300&quot; lacks the single-letter suffix of its forebears and appeared five years after the last Letter Series Chrysler, the 300L. Many automobile historians do not include the Hurst 300 as a Letter Series model. The concept of the car, however, does fit with the Letter Series cars, as it was a high-performance variant of the luxury 300, built with the input of aftermarket parts manufacturer Hurst Performance. Only 485 units are believed to have been built.

The Hurst 300s were all 2-door and shared a Spinnaker White and gold paint scheme similar to the Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds, Pontiac GTO and Pontiac Grand Prix Hurst models of mid-1960s to early 1970s. The scooped hood and trunk lid (with a molded spoiler) are both fiberglass. All Hurst 300s had satin tan leather interiors that were straight out of the Imperial and could be had with column- or console-mounted 727 automatics. All came with the 4-barrel &quot;TNT&quot; V8 engine. The suggested retail price was US$5,939 ($ in dollars ).

Of the 501 units sold, one convertible is documented having been used as a Hurst promotional car and another is believed to have been dealer equipped with a Hemi, also, a convertible.


== Collectibility ==
All original letter series cars are considered collectible , but the early years are much more desirable. The C-300 and 300B, especially red/maroon examples, are increasingly becoming some of the most valuable models of all 1950s performance cars due to their exquisite styling, high performance, and rarity. The 300C through 300G convertibles are the most desirable price-wise due to their scarcity and low survival rates; the coming of the regular 300 series cars in 1962 makes the subsequent letter series seem less special and less desirable to collectors.

At an auction at the Robson Estate in Gainesville, Georgia on November 13, 2010, the sole 1960 300F convertible equipped with the factory engine and the Pont-a-Mousson 4-speed sold for $437,250.

There was one concept vehicle called the Chrysler 300, created in 1991. It featured a sports car body and a Viper engine. It was never produced.

The 300 letter series name was resurrected in 1999 on the Chrysler 300M; but it is the 2005 300C that is closest to the original with its rear-wheel drive, and V8 engine once again bearing the &quot;Hemi&quot; name.

<text>The Topps Company, Inc. is an American company that manufactures trading cards and other collectibles. Formerly based in New York City, Topps is best known as a leading producer of baseball and other sports and non-sports themed trading cards. Topps also produces cards under the brand names Allen &amp; Ginter and Bowman.

In the 2010s, Topps was the only baseball card manufacturer with a license with Major League Baseball. Following the loss of that license to Fanatics, Inc. in 2022, Fanatics acquired Topps in the same year.

==Company history==
===Beginning and consolidation===
Topps was founded in 1938 by four brothers, Abram, Ira, Philip, and Joseph Shorin. The roots of Topps can be traced to American Leaf Tobacco, incorporated by the Shorin brothers’ father, Morris Shorin, in 1908.

American Leaf Tobacco encountered difficulties during World War I, as it was cut off from Turkish supplies of tobacco, and later as a result of the Great Depression. Shorin&#x27;s sons, Abram, Ira, Philip, and Joseph, decided to focus on a new product but take advantage of the company&#x27;s existing distribution channels. To do this, they relaunched the company as Topps, with the name meant to indicate that it would be &quot;tops&quot; in its field. The chosen field was the manufacture of chewing gum.

At the time, chewing gum was still a relative novelty sold in individual pieces. Topps&#x27;s most successful early product was Bazooka bubble gum, which was packaged with a small comic on the wrapper. Starting in 1950, the company decided to try increasing gum sales by packaging them together with trading cards featuring Western character Hopalong Cassidy (William Boyd); at the time Boyd, as one of the biggest stars of early television, was featured in newspaper articles and on magazine covers, along with a significant amount of &quot;Hoppy&quot; merchandising. When Topps next introduced baseball cards as a product, the cards immediately became its primary emphasis.

The &quot;father of the modern baseball card&quot; was Sy Berger. In the autumn of 1951, Berger, then a 28-year-old veteran of World War II, designed the 1952 Topps baseball card set with Woody Gelman on the kitchen table of his apartment on Alabama Avenue in Brooklyn. The card design included a player&#x27;s name, photo, facsimile autograph, team name and logo on the front; and the player&#x27;s height, weight, bats, throws, birthplace, birthday, stats and a short biography on the back. The basic design is still in use today. Berger would work for Topps for 50 years (1947–97) and serve as a consultant for another five, becoming a well-known figure on the baseball scene, and the face of Topps to major league baseball players, whom he signed up annually and paid in merchandise, like refrigerators and carpeting.

The Shorins, in recognition of his negotiation abilities, sent Sy to London in 1964 to negotiate the rights for Topps to produce Beatles trading cards. They also tried hockey. Arriving without an appointment, Sy succeeded by speaking in Yiddish to Brian Epstein, the Beatles&#x27; manager.

Berger hired a garbage boat to remove leftover boxes of 1952 baseball cards stored in their warehouse, and rode with them as a tugboat pulled them off the New Jersey shore. The cards were then dumped into the Atlantic Ocean. The cards included Mickey Mantle&#x27;s first Topps card, the most valuable card of the modern era. No one at the time, of course, knew the collector&#x27;s value the cards would one day attain. On August 28, 2022, the Mickey Mantle baseball card (Topps; #311; SGC MT 9.5) was sold for $12.600 million.

===Incorporation===

The company began its existence as Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., a partnership between the four Shorin brothers. It later incorporated under New York law in 1947. The entire company originally operated at the Bush Terminal in Brooklyn, but production facilities were moved to a plant in Duryea, Pennsylvania, in 1965 (the Duryea plant closed in 1997). Corporate offices remained at 254 36th Street in Brooklyn, a location in the waterfront district by the Gowanus Expressway. In 1994, the headquarters relocated to One Whitehall Street in lower Manhattan.

After being privately held for several decades, Topps offered stock to the public for the first time in 1972 with the assistance of investment banking firm White, Weld &amp; Co. The company returned to private ownership when it was acquired in a leveraged buyout led by Forstmann Little &amp; Company in 1984. The new ownership group again made Topps into a publicly traded company in 1987, now renamed to The Topps Company, Inc. In this incarnation, the company was reincorporated under Delaware General Corporation Law for legal reasons, but company headquarters remained in New York. Management was left in the hands of the Shorin family throughout all of these maneuverings.

On October 12, 2007, Topps was acquired by Michael Eisner&#x27;s The Tornante Company and Madison Dearborn Partners. Under Eisner&#x27;s direction, Topps began to expand into the entertainment and media business with plans for a &quot;Bazooka Joe&quot; movie. Former television executive Staci Weiss was hired as Topps&#x27;s head of entertainment to develop projects based on Topps properties, including &quot;Garbage Pail Kids, Wacky Packages, Dinosaurs Attack!, Mech Warrior&quot; and &quot;Attax&quot;.

===Topps Digital===
In 2012, Topps began creating digital sports cards, starting with the Topps Bunt baseball card mobile app. After releasing Bunt in 2013 and finding success with it, they expanded their sports card market into other apps including the Kick soccer app in August 2014, Huddle Football app in April 2016, and Skate hockey app in 2017.

Along with sports cards, Topps also expanded its marketplace for collectors of digital goods to include non-sports cards on mobile devices. In March 2015, they released their &quot;Star Wars Card Trader&quot; app, and in May 2016 they released a Walking Dead trading card app. Following the success of their assortment of digital trading card apps, they once again expanded their marketplace for digital collectors a few years later, releasing a Marvel trading card app in the spring of 2019 and their Disney trading card app in November of that same year.

In March 2020, Topps announced a collaboration with WAX.io to make their cards tradable on the blockchain. Topps has only made Garbage Pail Kids cards available to traders via blockchain but they have announced Alien Quadrilogy collectibles will be coming soon.

In April 2021, Topps announced plans to go public via a merger with Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corporation II, a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Michael Eisner&#x27;s firm The Tornante Company planned to roll its stake into the new company while Mudrick Capital would lead an additional investment of $250 million. The deal valued Topps at $1.3 billion. However, reports surfaced within six months of their initial plans that Mudrick Capital Management had backed out of the investment deal.

In August 2021, it was reported that Fanatics acquired future exclusive licenses with Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association to produce baseball cards. In January 2022, Fanatics announced they had acquired Topps for US$500 million.

==Topps Europe Ltd.==
===Purchase of Merlin===
Topps has a European division, which is based in Milton Keynes, UK. From this office products are launched across Europe, including Spain, France, Germany, Norway, and Italy. This division also co-ordinates products launches across the many other international markets including the Far East, Australia, and South Africa.

In 1994 Merlin acquired the Premier League license allowing the company to exclusively publish the only official Premier League sticker and album collection in the UK. The initial success of the Premier League stickers and album collection was so great that it took even Merlin by surprise, with reprint after reprint being produced.

In 1995, the Topps Company Inc. completed its takeover of Merlin Publishing. Merlin&#x27;s official company name changed to Topps Europe Limited, but its products still carried the Merlin brand until 2008 as it was easily recognized by consumers.

Topps Europe Limited continues to produce a wide and varied range of sports and entertainment collectibles across Europe. Its range of products now includes stickers, albums, cards and binders, magazines, stationery, and temporary tattoos.

===Topps Europe Ltd. products===
Topps Europe Ltd. has continued to launch hugely successful products across Europe. Some of the most successful licenses have included &quot;WWE&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;High School Musical&quot; and &quot;SpongeBob.&quot;

Topps &quot;Merlin&quot; branded Premier League sticker albums have been popular since their launch in 1994, and in 2007 Topps acquired the Premier League rights for trading cards. Previously, the trading card rights were held by Magic Box International who produced the &quot;Shoot Out&quot; cards from the 2003/04 to 2006/07 seasons. Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, was the biggest selling boys’ collectible in the UK three years running. Being sold across the globe in a number of countries, the collection also holds the title of the biggest selling sports collectible in the world. It is estimated that around 1.5 million children collect it in the UK alone.

Following on from the acquisition of Premier League trading cards rights, in the spring of 2008 Topps acquired the exclusive rights to the DFL Deutsche Fussball Liga GmbH for trading cards and stickers until the Bundesliga Season 2010/11. Bundesliga Match Attax was launched in January 2009 and is now available in over 40,000 stockists. The collection is the first of its kind in Germany and has become one of the biggest selling collections in the country. Now they sell a lot more of football cards.

As of February 2016 Topps Match Attax dominated the secondary UK card trading market occupying two out of the top three spots on the stickerpoints.com &#x27;most popular soccer collection&#x27; list.

In January 2023, Topps released both physical and digital trading cards for their latest partner the 24 Hours of Le Mans Motorsport event. The release is set for February 2023 and will feature art work from original race posters from 1923 to current day.

==Topps baseball cards: A history==
===Entry into the baseball card market===
In 1951, Topps produced its first baseball cards in two different sets known today as &quot;Red Backs&quot; and &quot;Blue Backs&quot;. Each set contained 52 cards, like a deck of playing cards, and in fact the cards could be used to play a game that would simulate the events of a baseball game. Also like playing cards, the cards had rounded corners and were blank on one side, which was colored either red or blue (hence the names given to these sets). The other side featured the portrait of a player within a baseball diamond in the center, and in opposite corners a picture of a baseball together with the event for that card, such as &quot;fly out&quot; or &quot;single.&quot;

Topps changed its approach in 1952, this time creating a much larger (407 total) set of baseball cards and packaging them with its signature product, bubble gum. The company also decided that its playing card model was too small (2 inches by 2-5/8 inches) and changed the dimensions to 2-5/8 inches by 3-3/4 inches with square corners. The cards now had a color portrait on one side, with statistical and biographical information on the other. This set became a landmark in the baseball card industry, and today the company considers this its first true baseball card set. Many of the oil paintings for the sets were rendered by artist Gerry Dvorak, who also worked as an animator for Famous Studios. In 1957, Topps shrank the dimensions of its cards slightly, to 2-1/2 inches by 3-1/2 inches, setting a standard that remains the basic format for most sports cards produced in the United States. It was at this time Topps began to use color photographs in their set.

The cards were released in several series over the course of the baseball season, a practice Topps would continue with its baseball cards until 1974. However, the last series of each year did not sell as well, as the baseball season wore on and popular attention began to turn towards American football. Thus cards from the last series are much scarcer and are typically more valuable (even commons) than earlier series of the same year. Topps was left with a substantial amount of surplus stock in 1952, which it largely disposed of by dumping many cards into the Atlantic. In later years, Topps either printed series in smaller quantities late in the season or destroyed excess cards. As a result, cards with higher numbers from this period are rarer than low numbers in the same set, and collectors will pay significantly higher prices for them. The last series in 1952 started with card No. 311, which is Topps&#x27;s first card of Mickey Mantle, and remains the most valuable Topps card ever (and, as of August 28, 2022, the most valuable trading card of all). On August 28, 2022, the Mickey Mantle baseball card (Topps; #311; SGC MT 9.5) was sold for $12.600 million. This 1952 Topps Mantle is often mistakenly referred to as Mantle&#x27;s rookie card, but that honor belongs to his 1951 Bowman card (which is worth less than the 1952 Topps card).

The combination of baseball cards and bubble gum was popular among young boys, and given the mediocre quality of the gum, the cards quickly became the primary attraction. In fact, the gum eventually became a hindrance because it tended to stain the cards, thus impairing their value to collectors who wanted to keep them in pristine condition. It (along with the traditional gray cardboard) was finally dropped from baseball card packs in 1992, although Topps began its Heritage line, which included gum, in the year 2001.

===Competition for player contracts===
During this period, baseball card manufacturers generally obtained the rights to depict players on merchandise by signing individual players to contracts for the purpose. Topps first became active in this process through an agent called Players Enterprises in July 1950, in preparation for its first 1951 set. The later acquisition of rights to additional players allowed Topps to release its second series.

This promptly brought Topps into furious competition with Bowman Gum, another company producing baseball cards. Bowman had become the primary maker of baseball cards and driven out several competitors by signing its players to exclusive contracts. The language of these contracts focused particularly on the rights to sell cards with chewing gum, which had already been established in the 1930s as a popular product to pair with baseball cards.

To avoid the language of Bowman&#x27;s existing contracts, Topps sold its 1951 cards with caramel candy instead of gum. However, because Bowman had signed many players in 1950 to contracts for that year, plus a renewal option for one year, Topps included in its own contracts the rights to sell cards with gum starting in 1952 (as it ultimately did). Topps also tried to establish exclusive rights through its contracts by having players agree not to grant similar rights to others, or renew existing contracts except where specifically noted in the contract.

Bowman responded by adding chewing gum &quot;or confections&quot; to the exclusivity language of its 1951 contracts, and also sued Topps in U.S. federal court. The lawsuit alleged infringement on Bowman&#x27;s trademarks, unfair competition, and contractual interference. The court rejected Bowman&#x27;s attempt to claim a trademark on the word &quot;baseball&quot; in connection with the sale of gum, and disposed of the unfair competition claim because Topps had made no attempt to pass its cards off as being made by Bowman. The contract issue proved more difficult because it turned on the dates when a given player signed contracts with each company, and whether the player&#x27;s contract with one company had an exception for his contract with the other.

As the contract situation was sorted out, several Topps sets during these years had a few &quot;missing&quot; cards, where the numbering of the set skips several numbers because they had been assigned to players whose cards could not legally be distributed. The competition, both for consumer attention and player contracts, continued until 1956, when Topps bought out Bowman. This left Topps as the predominant producer of baseball cards for the next quarter-century.

===Consolidation of a monopoly===
The next company to challenge Topps was Fleer, another gum manufacturer. Fleer signed star Ted Williams to an exclusive contract in 1959 and sold a set of cards oriented around him. Williams retired the next year, so Fleer began adding around him other mostly retired players in a &quot;Baseball Greats&quot; series, which was sold with gum. Two of these sets were produced before Fleer finally tried a 67-card set of currently active players in 1963. However, Topps held onto the rights of most players and the set was not particularly successful.

Stymied, Fleer turned its efforts to supporting an administrative complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission, alleging that Topps was engaging in unfair competition through its aggregation of exclusive contracts. A hearing examiner ruled against Topps in 1965, but the Commission reversed this decision on appeal. The Commission concluded that because the contracts only covered the sale of cards with gum, competition was still possible by selling cards with other small, low-cost products. However, Fleer chose not to pursue such options and instead sold its remaining player contracts to Topps for $395,000 in 1966. The decision gave Topps an effective monopoly of the baseball card market.

That same year, however, Topps faced an attempt to undermine its position from the nascent players&#x27; union, the Major League Baseball Players Association. Struggling to raise funds, the MLBPA discovered that it could generate significant income by pooling the publicity rights of its members and offering companies a group license to use their images on various products. After putting players on Coca-Cola bottlecaps for $120,000, the union concluded that the Topps contracts did not pay players adequately for their rights.

MLBPA executive director Marvin Miller then approached Joel Shorin, the president of Topps, about renegotiating these contracts. At this time, Topps had every major league player under contract, generally for five years plus renewal options, so Shorin declined. After continued discussions went nowhere, the union before the 1968 season asked its members to stop signing renewals on these contracts, and offered Fleer the exclusive rights to market cards of most players (with gum) starting in 1973. Although Fleer declined the proposal, by the end of the year Topps had agreed to double its payments to each player from $125 to $250, and also to begin paying players a percentage of Topps&#x27;s overall sales. The figure for individual player contracts has since increased to $500.

As a byproduct of this history, Topps continues to use individual player contracts as the basis for its baseball card sets today. This contrasts with other manufacturers, who all obtain group licenses from the MLBPA. The difference has occasionally affected whether specific players are included in particular sets. Players who decline to sign individual contracts will not have Topps cards even when the group licensing system allows other manufacturers to produce cards of the player, as happened with Alex Rodriguez early in his career. On the other hand, if a player opts out of group licensing, as Barry Bonds did in 2004, then manufacturers who depend on the MLBPA system will have no way of including him. Topps, however, can negotiate individually and was belatedly able to create a 2004 card of Bonds. In addition, Topps is the only manufacturer able to produce cards of players who worked as replacement players during the 1994 baseball strike, since they are barred from union membership and participation in the group licensing program.

===The monopoly and its end===
A semblance of competition returned to the baseball card market in the 1970s when Kellogg&#x27;s began producing &quot;3-D&quot; cards and inserting them in boxes of breakfast cereal (originally Corn Flakes, later Raisin Bran and other Kellogg&#x27;s brands). The Kellogg&#x27;s sets contained fewer cards than Topps sets, and the cards served as an incentive to buy the cereal, rather than being the intended focus of the purchase, as tended to be the case for cards distributed with smaller items like candy or gum. Topps took no action to stop them.

The Topps monopoly on baseball cards was finally broken by a lawsuit decided by federal judge Clarence Charles Newcomer in 1980, in which the judge ended Topps Chewing Gum&#x27;s exclusive right to sell baseball cards, allowing the Fleer Corporation to compete in the market. That let Fleer and another company, Donruss, enter the market in 1981. Fleer and Donruss began making large, widely distributed sets to compete directly with Topps, packaged with gum. When the ruling was overturned on appeal in August 1981, Topps appeared to have regained its monopoly, but both of its competitors instead began packaging their cards with other baseball items—logo stickers from Fleer, and cardboard puzzle pieces from Donruss. The puzzles, created by baseball artists Dick Perez for Perez Steele, included Warren Spahn, Hank Aaron, Mickey Mantle and a dozen others. Other manufacturers later followed, but Topps remains one of the leading brands in the baseball card hobby. In response to the competition, Topps began regularly issuing additional &quot;Traded&quot; sets featuring players who had changed teams since the main set was issued, following up on an idea it had experimented with a few years earlier.

===Topps in the modern baseball card industry===
While &quot;Traded&quot; or &quot;Update&quot; sets were originally conceived to deal with players who changed teams, they became increasingly important for another reason. In order to fill out a 132-card set (the number of cards that fit on a single sheet of the uncut cardboard used in the production process), it would contain a number of rookie players who had just reached the major leagues and not previously appeared on a card. They also included a few single cards of players who previously appeared in the regular set on a multi-player &quot;prospects&quot; card; one notable example is the 1982 Topps Traded Cal Ripken Jr. Since a &quot;rookie card&quot; is typically the most valuable for any given player, the companies now competed to be the first to produce a card of players who might be future stars. Increasingly, they also included highly touted minor league players who had yet to play in the major leagues. For example, Topps obtained a license to produce cards featuring the U.S. Olympic baseball team and thus produced the first card of Mark McGwire prior to his promotion to the major league level, and one that would become quite valuable to collectors for a time. This card from the 1984 squad appeared in Topps&#x27;s regular 1985 set, but by the next Olympic cycle the team&#x27;s cards had been migrated to the &quot;Traded&quot; set. As a further step in this race, Topps resurrected its former competitor Bowman as a subsidiary brand in 1989, with Bowman sets similarly chosen to include a lot of young players with bright prospects.
Also beginning in 1989 with the entry of Upper Deck into the market, card companies began to develop higher-end cards using improved technology. Following Topps&#x27;s example, other manufacturers now began to diversify their product lines into different sets, each catering to a different niche of the market. The initial Topps effort at producing a premium line of cards, in 1991, was called Stadium Club. Topps continued adding more sets and trying to distinguish them from each other, as did its competitors. The resulting glut of different baseball sets caused the MLBPA to take drastic measures as the market for them deteriorated. The union announced that for 2006, licenses would only be granted to Topps and Upper Deck, the number of different products would be limited, and players would not appear on cards before reaching the major leagues.

Although most of its products were distributed through retail stores and hobby shops, Topps also attempted to establish itself online, where a significant secondary market for sports cards was developing. Working in partnership with eBay, Topps launched a new brand of sports cards called eTopps in December 2000. These cards are sold exclusively online through individual &quot;IPOs&quot; (or, &quot;Initial Player Offering&quot;) in which the card is offered for usually a week at the IPO price. The quantity sold depends on how many people offer to buy, but is limited to a certain maximum. After a sale, the cards are held in a climate-controlled warehouse unless the buyer requests delivery, and the cards can be traded online without changing hands except in the virtual sense.

Topps also acquired ThePit.com, a startup company that earlier in 2000 had launched a site for online stock-market style card trading. The purchase was for $5.7 million cash in August 2001 after Topps had earlier committed to invest in a round of venture capital financing for the company. This undertaking was not very successful, however, and Topps unloaded the site on Naxcom in January 2006. The amount of the transaction was not disclosed, but Topps charged a $3.7 million after-tax loss on its books in connection with the sale.
In 2002, Topps revived the T206 set originally released in 1909–11 by the American Tobacco Company under the &quot;Topps 206&quot; brand, with current players. That first revival included the T206 Honus Wagner iconic card, with blue background instead of the original orange. A second revival would be launched in 2010.

Topps grabbed collectors&#x27; attention early in 2007 when the new card of Yankees&#x27; shortstop Derek Jeter was found to have been altered to include an image of Mickey Mantle standing in the dugout and President George W. Bush walking through the stands.

In 2009, Topps became the first official baseball card of MLB in over thirty years. The first product to fall under the deal was the 2010 Topps Baseball Series 1. The deal gave Topps exclusivity for the use of MLB and club trademarks and logos on cards, stickers and some other products featuring major league players. The exclusive deal was extended in 2013, then extended again in 2018. It is currently scheduled to go through at least 2025.

Again in 2020, the company released a new T206 collection divided into five different series, with the first (50 cards) being released in May 2020. The collection, named &quot;Topps 206&quot;, include players from both, Major and Minor League. The fifth series was released in September 2020.

At the start of the 2023 MLB season, Fanatics, Topps, and the MLB announced that all MLB rookies would wear &quot;MLB Debut&quot; patches on their jerseys. The patches are worn during a player&#x27;s first big league game, then removed, authenticated by MLB Authenticated Program. The patch is then included in a one-of-one Rookie Debut Patch Autograph Card, to be randomly inserted into Topps baseball card packs during the year.

==Card design==
Although Topps did not invent the concept of baseball cards, its dominance in the field basically allowed the company to define people&#x27;s expectations of what a baseball card would look like. In addition to establishing a standard size, Topps developed various design elements that are considered typical of baseball cards. Some of these were the company&#x27;s own innovations, such as the 1971 Football Set, while some were ideas borrowed from others that Topps helped popularize.

===Use of statistics===
One of the features that contributed significantly to Topps&#x27;s success beginning with the 1952 set was providing player statistics. At the time, complete and reliable baseball statistics for all players were not widely available, so Topps actually compiled the information itself from published box scores. While baseball cards themselves had been around for years, including statistics was a relative novelty that fascinated many collectors. Those who played with baseball cards could study the numbers and use them as the basis for comparing players, trading cards with friends, or playing imaginary baseball games. It also had some pedagogical benefit by encouraging youngsters to take an interest in the underlying mathematics.

The cards originally had one line for statistics from the most recent year (i.e. the 1951 season for cards in the 1952 set) and another with the player&#x27;s lifetime totals. Bowman promptly imitated this by putting statistics on its own cards where it had previously only had biographical information. For the first time in 1957, Topps put full year-by-year statistics for the player&#x27;s entire career on the back of the card. Over the next few years, Topps alternated between this format and merely showing the past season plus career totals. The practice of showing complete career statistics became permanent in 1963, except for one year, 1971, when Topps sacrificed the full statistics in order to put a player photo on the back of the card as well.

Although the 1971 set was an aborted experiment in terms of putting photos on card backs (they would not return until 1992), that year was also a landmark in terms of baseball card photography, as Topps for the first time included cards showing color photographs from actual games. The cards themselves had been in color from the beginning, though for the first few years this was done by using artist&#x27;s portraits of players rather than actual photographs and until 1971, Topps used mostly portrait or posed shots. The 1971 set is also known for its jet black borders, which because they chip so easily, makes it much more difficult to find top grade cards for 1971. The black borders would return for Topps&#x27;s 1985 football set and 2007 baseball set.

After starting out with simple portraits, in 1954 Topps put two pictures on the front of the card – a hand-tinted &#x27;color&#x27; close-up photo of the player&#x27;s head, and the other a black-and-white full-length pose. The same basic format was used in 1955, this time with the full-length photo also hand-tinted. For 1956, the close-up tinted photo was placed against a tinted full-background &#x27;game-action&#x27; photo of the player. The close-up head shots of some individual players were reused each year.

From 1957 on, virtually all cards were posed photographs, either as a head shot or together with a typical piece of equipment like a bat or glove. If using such a prop, the player might pose in a position as if he were in the act of batting, pitching, or fielding. Photographs did not appear in sharp focus and natural color until 1962. However, that year also saw problems with the print quality in the second series, which lacked the right proportion of ink and thus gave the photographs a distinctly greenish tint. The affected series of cards was then reprinted, and several players were actually shown in different poses in the reprinting. Although Topps had produced error cards and variations before, this was its largest single production glitch.

In the absence of full-color action photography, Topps still occasionally used artwork to depict action on a handful of cards. Starting in 1960 a few cards showed true game action, but the photographs were either in black-and-white or hand-tinted color; these cards were primarily highlights from the World Series. In addition to basic cards of individual players, Topps sets commonly include cards for special themes, the 1974 tribute to Hank Aaron as he was about to break Babe Ruth&#x27;s career home run record being one example. The 1972 set finally included color photographs, which were used for special &quot;In Action&quot; cards of selected star players. Thereafter, Topps began simply mixing game photography with posed shots in its sets.

Baseball artist Dick Perez was commissioned to paint art cards for Topps beginning in 2006. His art card series include Turkey Red and Allen &amp; Ginter.

When used for the cards of individual players, some of the early action photography had awkward results. The photos were sometimes out of focus or included several players, making it difficult to pick out the player who was supposed to be featured on the card. In a few cases, a misidentification meant that the player didn&#x27;t even appear in the picture. These problems diminished as Topps&#x27;s selection of photographs gradually improved.

Before statistics, biographical information, and commentary became the dominant element on the backs of cards, Topps also featured artwork there. This primarily involved using various types of cartoons drawn by its stable of artists. These appeared on card backs as late as 1982, but gradually declined in the prominence of their placement and the proportion of cards on which they appeared. In 1993, Topps finally managed again to incorporate a player photo on the back as well as the front of the card, after some competitors had been doing so for a number of years.

===Coping with updated developments===
The pictures and information on baseball cards sold during one season came primarily from earlier seasons, so Topps used various tactics to give its cards a greater sense of staying current with the times. Before coming up with the idea of a &quot;Traded&quot; set, the company still tried to produce cards of players with their new team if they changed teams in the offseason. This was sometimes accomplished by showing the player without any team cap, or by airbrushing out elements of the former team&#x27;s logo on his uniform. Cards for rookies could also be prepared by airbrushing over their minor-league uniforms in photos.

In one case, Topps even got too far in front of events, as in 1974 it showed a number of players as being with the &quot;Washington Nat&#x27;l Lea.&quot; franchise, due to expectations that the San Diego Padres would relocate to the vacant Washington, D.C., market. The team designation was the only change, as no new nickname for the franchise had been selected. When the move failed to materialize, Topps had to replace these with cards showing the players still as Padres.

On rare occasions, Topps has issued special cards for players who had either died or had been injured. The 1959 set had card 550 as &quot;Symbol Of Courage – Roy Campanella&quot;, with a color photo of the paralyzed former Dodger in his wheelchair and a black-and-white photo of him in uniform inserted to the upper left. The 1964 set issued cards for two recently deceased players: Ken Hubbs of the Cubs with a different &quot;In Memoriam&quot; front design compared to standard cards, and Colts pitcher Jim Umbricht&#x27;s regular card with a special note on the back about his April 1964 death from cancer. In October 2006, Topps was prepping for its annual updated/traded card release, which featured Cory Lidle in a Yankees uniform. After Lidle&#x27;s tragic death, the cards were pulled and subsequently released with &quot;In Memoriam&quot; on its front.

== American Football cards==

In addition to baseball, Topps also produced cards for American football in 1951, which are known as the &quot;Magic&quot; set. For football cards Bowman dominated the field, and Topps did not try again until 1955, when it released an &quot;All-American&quot; set with a mix of active players and retired stars. After buying out Bowman, Topps took over the market the following year.

Since then, Topps sold football cards every season until 2016. However, the emergence of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960 to compete with the established National Football League also allowed Topps&#x27;s competitors, beginning with Fleer, to make inroads. Fleer produced a set for the AFL in 1960, sets for both leagues for a year, and then began focusing on the AFL again. Philadelphia Gum secured the NFL rights for 1964, forcing Topps to go for the AFL and leaving Fleer with no product in either baseball or football.

Although more competitive for a time, the football card market was never as lucrative as the market for baseball cards, so the other companies did not fight as hard over it. After the AFL–NFL Merger was agreed to, Topps became the only major football card manufacturer beginning in 1968. In spite of the lack of competition, or perhaps to preempt it, Topps also created two sets of cards for the short-lived United States Football League in the 1980s. Many NFL legends had their first ever cards produced in the USFL sets. These players include Steve Young, Jim Kelly, and Reggie White. This resulted in a controversy when these players debuted in the NFL. Many wondered if the USFL cards should be considered rookie cards because the league did not exist anymore. The situation continued until growth in the sports card market generally prompted two new companies, Pro Set and Score, to start making football cards in 1989.

Throughout the 1970s until 1982, Topps did not have the rights to reproduce the actual team logos on the helmets and uniforms of the players; curiously, these could be found on the Fleer sets of the same era, but Fleer could not name specific player names (likely an issue of Topps holding the National Football League Players Association license and Fleer holding the license from the league). As a result, helmet logos for these teams were airbrushed out on a routine basis.

After the 2015 football season, Panini was awarded an exclusive license by the NFL for producing football cards. 2016 was the first year Topps did not produce football cards since 1955.

==Trading cards for other sports==
Topps also makes cards for other major North American professional sports. Its next venture was into ice hockey, with a 1954 set featuring players from the four National Hockey League franchises located in the U.S. at the time: the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, and New York Rangers.

In 1958, the O-Pee-Chee Company of London, Ontario, Canada, entered into an agreement with Topps to produce NHL cards (the 1957–58 series) and Canadian football cards (the 1958 series). O-Pee-Chee then started printing its own hockey and football cards in 1961. Similarly, the Topps Company struck agreements with Amalgamated and British Confectionery in the United Kingdom and Scanlen&#x27;s in Australia.

In 1967, with the major expansion of six new NHL teams to the United States, the Topps Company produced a new hockey card set that paralleled the 1966–67 O-Pee-Chee hockey design (the basic television design was in fact first used for 1966 Topps American football series). Starting in 1968–69, the Topps Company started printing an annual Topps hockey set that was similar to the annual O-Pee-Chee hockey set. The Topps and O-Pee-Chee hockey sets shared a similar design from 1968–69 to 1981–82 and from 1984–85 to 1991–92.

Topps first sold cards for basketball in 1957, but stopped after one season. The company started producing basketball cards again in 1969 and continued until 1982, but then abandoned the market for another decade, missing out on printing the prized rookie cards of Michael Jordan and other mid- and late-1980s National Basketball Association stars. Topps finally returned to basketball cards in 1992, several years after its competitors. This would be perfect timing, because 1992 was the rookie year of Shaquille O&#x27;Neal.

In the United Kingdom, where football stickers have been popular over roughly the same period of time as trading cards, Topps acquired the old Amalgamated and British Confectionery firm in 1974, bringing its production methods and card style to Britain. Topps also makes cards for the Scottish Professional Football League. Under its Merlin brand, it has the licence to produce stickers for the Premier League and the national team. Its main competition is the Italian firm Panini. Until 2019, Topps made &#x27;Topps Premier League&#x27; stickers and the Match Attax trading card game, and since 2015 it has produced stickers and trading cards for the UEFA Champions League. trading card hockey and wrestling cards

In 2008, Topps gained the rights to production of WWE trading cards. The first variation of cards were aptly titled Slam Attax, a play on words of the previously popular football trading card game Match Attax (also made by Topps). The first set was released in late 2008 in the U.K., and it was then later released in the United States in mid-2009. This later proved to be a pattern for subsequent Slam Attax sets and variations, with the U.K. getting an earlier release than the U.S.. After failing to take off, Topps ceased production of Slam Attax cards in the U.S. after only two sets, whilst continuing the line in the U.K. and in Europe where in contrast the brand had become more popular. It remains today one of the longest running Topps brands in the U.K..

In 2008, Topps and Zuffa, LLC signed an exclusive agreement to produce mixed martial arts trading cards. Among the included cards were current and former athletes from the UFC.

==Non-sports products==

Originally, Topps was purely a gum company, and its first product was simply called &quot;Topps gum&quot;. Other gum and candy products followed. In imitation of Bowman and other competitors, Topps eventually began producing humor products unrelated to sports. This included stickers, posters (Wanted Posters, Travel Posters), media tie-ins (&quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;), book covers (Batty Bookcovers) and toys (Flying Things), plus offbeat packaging (Garbage Candy). More recently, the company published comic books and games.

===Candy and confectionery items===
The longest-lived Topps product line remains Bazooka bubble gum, small pieces of gum in patriotic red, white, and blue packaging. Bazooka was introduced in 1947 as a bar of gum that sold for five cents. Unlike the gum sold with baseball cards, it was of better quality and capable of selling on its own merit. In 1953, Topps began selling smaller penny pieces with the &quot;Bazooka Joe&quot; comic strip on the wrapper as an added attraction.

Even though baseball cards became the company&#x27;s primary focus during this period, Topps still developed a variety of candy items. For quite a few years, the company stuck within familiar confines, and virtually all of these products involved gum in some way. Sales declined significantly in the 1970s, however, when this relatively hard gum was challenged by Bubble Yum, a new, softer form of bubble gum from Life Savers.

Later, Topps added more candy items without gum. One particular focus has been lollipops, such as Ring Pops. However, Topps has noted that increasing public attention to childhood nutrition undercuts its candy sales. Under pressure by shareholders, the company considered selling off its confectionery business in 2005, but was unable to find a buyer to meet its price and decided to cut management expenses instead.

Other brands include Push Pop, Baby Bottle Pop, and Juicy Drop Pop.

Discontinued products include the Vertigo lollipop, that consisted of a creamy lollipop with a chocolate half and the Wazoo bar.

When the Topps name was sold with the trading card business and entertainment properties to Fanatics, the confectionary business was spun-off as Bazooka Brands, which remains owned by the previous owners.

===Non-sports trading cards===

As its sports products relied more on photography, Topps redirected its artistic efforts toward non-sports trading cards, on themes inspired by popular culture. For example, the Space Race prompted a set of &quot;Space Cards&quot; in 1958. Topps has continued to create collectible cards and stickers on a variety of subjects, often targeting the same adolescent male audience as its baseball cards. In particular, these have covered movies, television series, and other cultural phenomena ranging from the Beatles to the life story of John F. Kennedy. The many &quot;Star Wars&quot; card series have done well, with a few exceptions. Future screenwriter Gary Gerani (&quot;Pumpkinhead&#x27;) joined the company in 1972 and became the editor/writer of almost all movie and television tie-in products, most notably the numerous &quot;Star Wars&quot; sets, while also creating and helming original card properties such as 1988&#x27;s &quot;Dinosaurs Attack!&quot;.

Many Topps artists came from the world of comics and continued to work in that field as well. The shift from sports to other topics better suited the creative instincts of the artists and coincided with turmoil in the comic book industry over regulation by the Comics Code Authority. Beginning at Topps when he was a teenager, Art Spiegelman was the company&#x27;s main staff cartoonist for more than 20 years. Other staffers in Topps&#x27;s Product Development Department at various times included Larry Riley, Mark Newgarden, Bhob Stewart and Rick Varesi. Topps&#x27;s creative directors of Product Development, Woody Gelman and Len Brown, gave freelance assignments to leading comic book illustrators, such as Jack Davis, Wally Wood and Bob Powell. Spiegelman, Gelman and Brown also hired freelance artists from the underground comix movement, including Bill Griffith and Kim Deitch and Robert Crumb. Jay Lynch did extensive cartooning for Topps over several decades.

Drawing on their previous work, these artists were adept at things like mixing humor and horror, as with the Funny Monsters cards in 1959. The 1962 &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; cards, sketched by Wood and Powell and painted by Norman Saunders, later inspired a Tim Burton movie. A tie-in with the &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; film led to a 1994 card series, a new 100-card &quot;Archives&quot; set reprinting the 55 original cards, plus 45 new cards from several different artists, including Norm Saunders&#x27; daughter, Zina Saunders.

Among Topps&#x27;s most notable achievements in the area of satire and parody have been &quot;Wacky Packages&quot;, a takeoff on various household consumer products, and &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&quot;, a parody of the Cabbage Patch Kids dolls. Another popular series was the &quot;Civil War News&quot; set, also with Norman Saunders&#x27; artwork.

Earlier, particularly in the early and mid-60s, Topps thrived with several successful series of parody and satire cards for a variety of occasions, usually featuring artists who also worked at &quot;Mad&quot; magazine. There were several insult-valentine card series, plus a series of insult epigram cards called Wacky Plaques, several series of well-known-product advertising parody cards, a set of cards featuring the &#x27;mad car-driver cartoons&#x27; of artist Big Daddy Roth, and a card-sticker series of fanciful bizarre &#x27;rejected aliens&#x27; from other planets, among other semi-subversive outrageous over-the-top concepts designed for the semi-rebellious adolescent boomer market.

Although baseball cards have been Topps&#x27;s most consistently profitable item, certain fads have occasionally produced spikes in popularity for non-sports items. For a period beginning in 1973, the &quot;Wacky Packages&quot; stickers managed to outsell Topps baseball cards, becoming the first product to do so since the company&#x27;s early days as purely a gum and candy maker. &quot;Pokémon&quot; cards would accomplish the same feat for a few years starting in 1999. In the absence of new fads to capitalize on, Topps has come under pressure from stock analysts, since its sports card business is more stable and has less growth potential.

In 2015, Topps started to expand its non-sports category by adding more TV shows, as well as sci-fi with its brand-new &quot;Star Wars&quot; line (expanding into its own Topps virtual card app, similar to Topps BUNT), as well as &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, with regular autographs as well as vintage cut autographs, screen-worn relics, and more.

===Disney Channel===
Topps worked together with the Disney Channel to create trading cards of &quot;High School Musical&quot;, &quot;High School Musical 2&quot;, &quot;High School Musical 3&quot;, and &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;.

===Comic books===

Drawing on its established connections with artists, in 1993, Topps created a division of the company to publish comic books. Known as Topps Comics, its early efforts included several concepts from retired industry legend Jack Kirby, known collectively as the &quot;Kirbyverse&quot;. Topps Comics particularly specialized in licensed titles with tie-ins to movies or television series, though it also published a few original series. Its longest-running and best-selling title was &quot;The X-Files&quot;, based on the Fox TV show.

These comic books featured former Marvel Comics editor Jim Salicrup as its editor-in-chief. Apart from &quot;The X-Files&quot;, some of the more famous titles included &quot;Lone Ranger and Tonto&quot; by Timothy Truman, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Mars Attacks&quot;, and &quot;Zorro&quot;, which introduced the famous comics character Lady Rawhide. With sales stagnating, the company decided to pull out of the comics business in 1998.

===Games===
The Topps Pokémon cards were purely for entertainment, pleasure and collecting, but a new niche of collectible card games was also developing during this period (a Pokémon trading card game was produced simultaneously by Wizards of the Coast). Topps made its first foray into the world of games in July 2003 by acquiring the game company WizKids for $29.4 million in cash, thus acquiring ownership of the rights to the well-known gaming universes of &quot;BattleTech&quot; and &quot;Shadowrun&quot;. By inventing yet another niche, the constructible strategy game &quot;Pirates of the Spanish Main&quot;, this unit managed to reach profitability. Topps shut down Wizkids operation in November 2008 due to the economic downturn. The brand was acquired by NECA in September 2009.

== Controversy ==
In 2021, Topps was criticized for its depiction of South Korean boyband BTS in its Grammy-themed collection, which was seen as racist and violent. In response to public backlash, the company apologized and the cards were removed from its production lineup.

<text>Snowflake (, , ; – 24 November 2003) was a western lowland gorilla who is the world&#x27;s only known albino gorilla to date. He was kept at Barcelona Zoo in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, from 1966 until his death in 2003.

==History==
Snowflake was captured in the Río Muni region in Spanish Guinea on 1 October 1966 by Benito Mañé, a farmer of the Fang people. Mañé had killed the rest of Snowflake&#x27;s gorilla group, who were all typically colored gorillas. Mañé then kept Snowflake at his home for four days before transporting him to Bata, where he was purchased by primatologist Jordi Sabater Pi.

Originally named &quot;Nfumu Ngui&quot; in Fang language (&quot;white gorilla&quot;) by his captor, he was then nicknamed &quot;Floquet de Neu&quot; (Catalan for &quot;little snowflake&quot;) by his keeper, Jordi Sabater Pi.

==Characteristics==
Snowflake was a western lowland gorilla with non-syndromic oculocutaneous albinism. He had poor vision, though tests to determine whether he had a central blind spot did not find one. Barcelona Zoo director Antonio Jonch wrote: &quot;The eye had a blueish sclera, a normal cornea, and a light blue iris which was very transparent to transillumination. Accommodation and refraction were normal. The media were transparent and the fundus of the eye normal and totally depigmented. The choroidal vessels were perfectly visible and the pupil was normal. The animal displayed marked photophobia, which caused it to close its eyes repeatedly when exposed to bright light. In diffuse light similar to that in its biotope, we calculated that it blinked on an average of 20 times a minute.&quot;

Study of Snowflake&#x27;s genome determined that his parents had 12% of their DNA in common, leading researchers to believe that his parents were uncle and niece. The same study revealed that his albinism was caused by a mutation of the &quot;SLC45A2&quot; gene. Snowflake received the recessive gene from both parents, causing his albinism.

==Life in Barcelona==

Upon his arrival to Barcelona in November 1966, he was given an official reception by the then-mayor of Barcelona, Josep Maria de Porcioles, and called &quot;Blancanieves&quot; (&quot;Snow White&quot;) in the newspaper &quot;Tele/Exprés&quot;. He became famous, though, with the name given to him by Sabater when &quot;National Geographic&quot; featured him on the cover in March 1967, with the English name Snowflake. This name spread among the press (&quot;Stern&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Paris-Match&quot;). Sabater himself called the gorilla &quot;Copi&quot; or &quot;Floquet&quot;, and in the later years &quot;Nfumu&quot;. 

===Offspring===
Snowflake fathered 22 offspring by three different mates, or &quot;dams&quot;. Six of his offspring survived to adulthood. None of Snowflake&#x27;s offspring were albino, but all should be heterozygous, recessive carriers, for the albino gene. Half of his grandchildren likely carry the albino gene. If both parents were albino gene carriers, they have a 25% chance of producing an albino offspring and a 50% chance that the offspring will be a carrier of the gene. 

As of September 2021, Snowflake had a total of 21 grandchildren (11 survived) and eight great-grandchildren (all living). Snowflake&#x27;s great-grandson N&#x27;Kou has pink fingers, which is perhaps suggestive of partial albinism.

==Death==
In 2001, Snowflake was diagnosed with an unusual form of skin cancer, almost certainly related to his albinism. By 2003, Snowflake&#x27;s health began to deteriorate. After he began losing interest in his usual activities, isolating himself from other gorillas and exhibiting signs of pain, Snowflake&#x27;s keepers decided to euthanize him. The decision was publicly announced in September 2003. Thousands of people visited Snowflake at the Barcelona Zoo before he was euthanized on 24 November 2003. At the time of his death, Snowflake was thought to be between 38 and 40 years old.

==Legacy==

* The asteroid 95962 Copito, discovered by Spanish astronomer J. Manteca, is named in his honour.
* A scholarship for research on primatology was created in memory of and homage to Snowflake. Snowflake&#x27;s fame also helped to promote awareness of the endangered gorilla species.
* An illustration and brief description of Snowflake (as of 1969) appears in the Italian children nonfiction book series &quot;Guarda e Scopri Gli Animali&quot;. 
* The gorilla became a main character in the novel &quot;Memòries d&#x27;en Floquet de Neu&quot; (&quot;Snowflake&#x27;s Memories&quot;) by Catalan writer Toni Sala.
* Sabater Pi also dedicated a book to the gorilla, under the title &quot;Copito para Siempre&quot; (&quot;Snowflake Forever&quot;).
* He also makes a brief appearance in Italo Calvino&#x27;s novel &quot;Mr. Palomar&quot; – the passage is a meditation on loneliness, captivity, the burden of being unique in the world, and mortality.
* &quot;Nature&quot; on PBS devoted an episode to him.
* Former U.S. Poet Laureate Billy Collins wrote of Snowflake in his poem, &quot;Searching,&quot; published in his 2008 collection, &quot;Ballistics.&quot;
* Snowflake appears on the front cover of dance music act Basement Jaxx&#x27;s album &quot;Rooty&quot;.
* While playing at FC Barcelona, Dutch football player Ronald Koeman was nicknamed &quot;Copito de Nieve&quot; because of his blond hair.
* Snowflake appeared on &quot;The Triplets&quot; (Les Tres Bessones) episode &quot;The Triplets meet King Kong&quot; as a guest of honor for the appearance of King Kong in Barcelona&#x27;s Olympic Stadium.
* In 2009 French musician Enzo Enzo released the album &quot;Toutim&quot; where the song &quot;Copito De Nieve De Barcelone&quot; is dedicated to Snowflake.
* In 2011, there was a live action/CGI film called &quot;Snowflake, the White Gorilla&quot; that depicts the fictional childhood of Snowflake (voiced by Kai Stroink in the original Spanish version and by Ariana Grande in the English dub).

==Albino gorillas in other media==

Other albino (or white-furred) gorillas similar in appearance to Snowflake have appeared in different media.
* Prior to the birth of Snowflake, the film &quot;Son of Kong&quot; featured King Kong&#x27;s son, which was an albino gorilla that was twice the height of a human and was named &quot;Little Kong&quot;.
* In &quot;Legends of Chima&quot;, the Gorilla Tribe member Grizzam has white fur similar to Snowflake.
* In &quot;Black Dynamite (TV series)&quot;, there is a large albino gorilla also named Nfumu by a member of the Fang people. The gorilla is colloquially known in the show as Honky Kong.
* A white-furred gorilla appears in the French superhero comic series &quot;Photonik&quot; (featuring in &quot;African Devil&quot;; Volume 1, &quot;Mustang&quot; #66, 1981), serving as the totem for an evil shaman who wishes to rule all of Africa. As was the case with Snowflake, his entire group is killed by an unscrupulous poacher, and the white gorilla sold into captivity.
* In &quot;The Flash&quot;, Solovar was depicted as an albino gorilla.
* In the &quot;Planet of the Apes franchise&quot;, an albino western lowland gorilla named Winter (voiced and motion-captured by Aleks Paunovic), appears in Caesar&#x27;s tribe and defected to the Colonel&#x27;s side out of fear.
* In the 2018 film &quot;Rampage&quot; (which is based on the video game series of the same name), George (motion-captured by Jason Liles) is albino in the movie adaptation to differentiate him from King Kong. Dwayne Johnson stated that George is based on Snowflake.
* In &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, Uhk&#x27;loc is a rare tamable gorilla NPC with a unique silver/white skin.
* In Zoo Empire, you can unlock the Albino gorilla as a species. There&#x27;s also a program named Snowflake at the education center.

<doc id="378131" wikidata="Q4884813" url="?curid=378131" title="Beltway bandit">
<text>Beltway bandit is a term for private companies located in or near Washington, D.C., whose major business is to provide consulting services to the federal government of the United States. The phrase was originally a mild insult, implying that the companies preyed like bandits on the generosity of the federal government, but it has lost much of its pejorative nature and is now often used as a neutral, descriptive term.

The term refers to the Capital Beltway, which is a ring road that surrounds Washington. Many federal government contractors have offices and headquarters near the Beltway because of its proximity to federal agencies and legislators. Civilian contractors tend to locate along the Maryland portion of the Beltway, while defense contractors tend to locate along the Virginia section, which is closer to the Pentagon.

==History==
An early use of the term may have been from a description of thieves who took advantage of the newly constructed Beltway to rob houses from their back yards, which were now exposed to the highway. Neighbors would not have seen them from the front yards, and by the time the police arrived, the thieves would have used the Beltway to escape to another state, when communications between Virginia and Maryland police departments was fairly rudimentary.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;The Beltway Bandits&quot; is an instrumental piece of music by Frank Zappa on his 1986 &quot;Jazz from Hell&quot; album. Beltway Bandits is also the name of a Mid-Atlantic Women&#x27;s Hockey League (amateur ice hockey) team in the DC area.

<text>George Thomas &quot;Mickey&quot; Leland III (November 27, 1944 – August 7, 1989) was an American politician and anti-poverty activist. He served as a congressman from the Texas 18th District and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. He was a Democrat.

==Early years==
Leland was born in Lubbock, Texas to Alice and George Thomas Leland, II. At a very early age, the Lelands moved to Houston&#x27;s Fifth Ward neighborhood.

Growing up in a predominantly African American neighborhood, Leland attended Wheatley High School in Houston, Texas, where he ranked in the top ten percent of his class when he graduated from Wheatley in 1964. While attending Texas Southern University in the late 1960s, he emerged as a vocal leader of the Houston-area civil rights movement and had brought national leaders of the movement to Houston. Leland graduated from Texas Southern in 1970 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Pharmacy. He served as an Instructor of Clinical Pharmacy at his alma mater in 1970–71, where he set up &quot;door-to-door&quot; outreach campaigns in low-income neighborhoods to inform people about their medical care options and performing preliminary screenings.

It was during the administration of then-Texas Southern University President Leonard O. Spearman, where Leland received an honorary doctorate degree from his alma mater.

==Texas House of Representatives==
In 1972, Texas for the first time allowed its State House of Representatives and Senate seats to be elected as single-member districts. Soon after the decision, five minority candidates (dubbed the &quot;People&#x27;s Five&quot;), including eventual winners Leland, Craig Washington and Benny Reyes ran for district seats in the Texas House of Representatives, a first for a state that had not seen any African-American state representatives since Reconstruction although Barbara Jordan had been a state senator.

Re-elected in 1974 and again in 1976, Leland served three two-year terms in the Texas House of Representatives, representing the 88th District and while in Austin, he became famous for being a staunch advocate of healthcare rights for poor Texans. He was responsible for the passage of legislation that provided low-income consumers with access to affordable generic drugs, and supported the creation of healthcare access through Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). In order to accomplish his goals in Austin, Leland served on the Texas State Labor Committee, the State Affairs Committee, the Human Resources Committee, the Legislative Council, and the Subcommittee on Occupational and Industrial Safety. He was elected the Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee on Prison Reform including becoming the first African-American to serve on the Senate–House Conference Committee as a member of the House Appropriations Committee.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
After six years in the Texas State Legislature, Leland was elected to the United States House of Representatives in November 1978 to represent Texas&#x27;s 18th District and was re-elected easily in 1980, 1982, 1984, 1986 and again in 1988 to six two-year terms, serving until his death. The congressional district included the neighborhood in which he had grown up, and he was recognized as a knowledgeable advocate for health, children and the elderly. His leadership abilities were immediately noticed in Washington, and he was named to serve as Freshman Majority Whip in his first term, and later served twice as At-Large Majority Whip. Leland was re-elected to each succeeding Congress until his death.
Leland was an effective advocate on hunger and public health issues. In 1984, Leland established the congressional select committee on Hunger and initiated a number of programs designed to assuage the famine crises that plagued Ethiopia and Sudan through much of the 1980s. Leland pioneered many afro-centric cultural norms in Washington which included wearing a dashiki and African-style hats.

As he visited soup kitchens and makeshift shelters, he became increasingly concerned about the hungry and homeless. The work for which he is best remembered began when Leland co-authored legislation with U.S. Rep. Ben Gilman (R-New York State) in establishing the House Select Committee on Hunger. U.S. Speaker of the House Tip O&#x27;Neill (D-Massachusetts) named Leland chairman when it was enacted in 1984. The Select Committee&#x27;s mandate was to &quot;conduct a continuing, comprehensive study and review of the problems of hunger and malnutrition.&quot;

Although the committee had no legislative jurisdiction, the committee for the first time provided a single focus for hunger-related issues. The committee&#x27;s impact and influence would stem largely from Leland&#x27;s ability to generate awareness of complex hunger alleviation issues and exert his personal moral leadership. In addition to focusing attention on issues of hunger, his legislative initiatives would create the National Commission on Infant Mortality, better access for fresh food for at-risk women, children and infants, and the first comprehensive services for the homeless.

Leland&#x27;s sensitivity to the immediate needs of poor and hungry people would soon make him a spokesperson for hungry people on a far broader scale. Reports of acute famine in sub-Saharan Africa immediately prompted Speaker O&#x27;Neill to ask Leland to lead a bipartisan Congressional delegation to assess conditions and relief requirements. When Leland returned, he brought together entertainment personalities, religious leaders and private voluntary agencies to create general public support for the Africa Famine Relief and Recovery Act of 1985. That legislation provided $800 million in food and humanitarian relief supplies. The international attention Leland had focused on the famine brought additional support for non-governmental efforts, saving thousands of lives.

His ability in reaching out to others with innovative ideas and to gain support from unlikely sources was a key to his success in effectively addressing the problems for the poor and minorities. He met with both Pope John Paul II about food aid to Africa and Cuban President Fidel Castro about reuniting Cuban families. In Moscow, as part of the first Congressional delegation led by a Speaker of the House as part of the post-Cold War Era, he proposed a joint US-Soviet food initiative to Mozambique. As Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Leland proudly presented the first awards the caucus had ever given to non-black recipients: rock musician Bob Geldof and news anchor Ted Koppel. Geldof was honored for his Band Aid concert and fund-raising efforts for African famine victims, while Koppel was honored for his news stories on the African famine.

Leland was a powerful advocate on other major issues as well. While chairing the House Select Committee on Hunger, Leland was a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and the Subcommittees on Telecommunications and Finance, Health and the Environment, and Energy and Power. He chaired the Subcommittee on Postal Operations and Services and served on the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service and the Subcommittee on Compensation and Employment.

==Death==
On August 7, 1989, Leland died in a plane crash in Gambela, Ethiopia, during a mission to Fugnido, Ethiopia. A total of 16 people died in the crash, also including the acclaimed writer Roberta Worrick, who wrote under the pen name Maria Thomas. Leland&#x27;s friend and former fellow Texas legislator, Craig Washington, was elected to his unexpired congressional term in December 1989.

== Personal life ==
In 1983, Leland married Alison Clarke Walton (b. 1959), who he had initially met a year earlier at a reception on Capitol Hill while she was attending her first semester at Georgetown Law School. After being convinced by her friends to approach Leland for an internship, the two later attended their first date at a dinner at Al Gore&#x27;s home. They had three sons, Jarrett David (b. February 6, 1986) and twins, Austin Mickey and Cameron George (b. January 14, 1990 after Leland&#x27;s death).

Leland was Catholic.

*Mickey Leland Primary School in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

There is a statue on Leland in Hermann Park, Houston, near the Miller Outdoor Theatre.

<doc id="378151" wikidata="Q1753754" url="?curid=378151" title="Master of the Rolls">
<text>The Keeper or Master of the Rolls and Records of the Chancery of England, known as the Master of the Rolls, is the President of the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales and Head of Civil Justice. As a judge, the Master of the Rolls is second in seniority in England and Wales only to the Lord Chief Justice. The position dates from at least 1286, although it is believed that the office probably existed earlier than that.

The Master of the Rolls was initially a clerk responsible for keeping the &quot;Rolls&quot; or records of the Court of Chancery, and was known as the Keeper of the Rolls of Chancery. The Keeper was the most senior of the dozen Chancery clerks, and as such occasionally acted as keeper of the Great Seal of the Realm. The post evolved into a judicial one as the Court of Chancery did; the first reference to judicial duties dates from 1520. With the Judicature Act 1873, which merged the Court of Chancery with the other major courts, the Master of the Rolls joined the Chancery Division of the High Court and the Court of Appeal, but left the Chancery Division by the terms of the Judicature Act 1881. The Master of the Rolls had also been warden of the little-used Domus Conversorum for housing Jewish converts, which led to the house and chapel being used to store legal documents and later becoming the location of the Public Record Office. He retained his clerical functions as the nominal head of the Public Record Office until the Public Records Act 1958 transferred responsibility for it to the Lord Chancellor. One residual reminder of this role is the fact that the Master of the Rolls of the day continues to serve, &quot;ex officio&quot;, as President of the British Records Association. The Master of the Rolls was also previously responsible for registering solicitors, the officers of the Senior Courts.

One of the most prominent people to hold the position was Thomas Cromwell, a highly influential figure during the reign of Henry VIII; more recently, Lord Denning held the position for 20 years, from 1962 to 1982, and made sweeping changes in the common law. The current Master of the Rolls is Sir Geoffrey Vos, who took office in January 2021.

== The Rolls Estate ==
The substantial estate of the Domus Conversorum, between London and Westminster, became attached to the office of Master of the Rolls, and was known as the &quot;Rolls Estate&quot;, regarded as virtually an Inn of Court.

<text>88 (eighty-eight) is the natural number following 87 and preceding 89.

== In mathematics ==
88 is:

* a refactorable number.
* a primitive semiperfect number.
* an untouchable number.
* a hexadecagonal number.
* an Erdős–Woods number, since it is possible to find sequences of 88 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member.
* a palindromic number in bases 5 (3235), 10 (8810), 21 (4421), and 43 (2243).
* a repdigit in bases 10, 21 and 43.
* a 2-automorphic number.
* the smallest positive integer with a Zeckendorf representation requiring 5 Fibonacci numbers.
* a strobogrammatic number.
* the largest number in English not containing the letter &#x27;n&#x27; in its name, when using short scale.
88 and 945 are the smallest coprime abundant numbers, since all numbers until 945 are multiples of 2, 945 has 3, 5 and 7 as divisors, and 88 is the first abundant number that doesn&#x27;t have 3, 5 or 7 as divisors.

== Cultural significance ==

=== In Chinese culture ===

Number 88 symbolizes fortune and good luck in Chinese culture, since the word 8 sounds similar to the word &quot;fā&quot; (, which implies , or wealth, in Mandarin or Cantonese). The number 8 is considered to be the luckiest number in Chinese culture, and prices in Chinese supermarkets often contain many 8s. The shape of the Chinese character for 8 () implies that a person will have a great, wide future as the character starts narrow and gets wider toward the bottom. The Chinese government has been auctioning auto license plates containing many 8s for tens of thousands of dollars. The 2008 Beijing Olympics opened at 8 p.m., 8 August 2008.

In addition, 88 is also used to mean &quot;bye bye ()&quot; in Chinese-language chats, text messages, SMSs and IMs, because its pronunciation in Mandarin is similar to &quot;bye bye&quot;.

===In amateur radio===
In amateur radio, 88 is used as shorthand for &quot;love and kisses&quot; when signing a message or ending an exchange. It is used in spoken word (radiotelephony), Morse code (radiotelegraphy), and in various digital modes. It is considered rather more intimate than &quot;73&quot;, which means &quot;best regards&quot;; therefore 73 is more often used. The two may be used together. Sometimes either expression is pluralized by appending an -s. These number codes originate with the 92 Code adopted by Western Union in 1859.

===In neo-Nazism===

Neo-Nazis use the number 88 as an abbreviation for the Nazi salute &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;. The letter &quot;H&quot; is eighth in the alphabet, whereby 88 becomes &quot;HH&quot;.

Often, this number is associated with the number 14, e.g. 14/88, 14-88, or 1488; this number symbolizes the Fourteen Words coined by David Lane, a prominent white supremacist. Example uses of 88 include the song &quot;88 Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Band&quot; by Landser, and the organizations Column 88 and Unit 88.

The number is banned on Austrian license plates due to its association with &quot;Heil Hitler [and] where H comes in the alphabet&quot;. In June 2023, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) and the Italian government announced that the number 88 would be banned from use in Italian association football, as part of a joint initiative to combat antisemitism. This followed an incident in March of that year in which a Lazio supporter wore a club shirt bearing the name &quot;Hitlerson&quot; and the number 88, which led to the supporter receiving a lifetime ban from attending Lazio matches.

In the US, former FBI assistant director of counterintelligence Frank Figliuzzi declared in 2019 that something as innocuous as raising a flag on the White House to full staff on 8 August (i.e. 8–8) is a &quot;messaging&quot; problem because &quot;the numbers 88 are very significant in neo-Nazi and white supremacy movement.&quot;

== In other fields ==

Eighty-eight (88) is also:
*In the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; films, 88 miles per hour is the speed that Doctor Emmett Brown&#x27;s Delorean car had to reach in order to attain time travel.
*in hip hop, where &quot;88&quot; stands for &quot;HH&quot;, short for &quot;hip hop&quot;

<text>Godric of Finchale (or St Goderic) ( – 21 May 1170) was an English hermit, merchant and popular medieval saint, although he was never formally canonised. He was born in Walpole in Norfolk and died in Finchale in County Durham.

Some of the earliest surviving English songs have been attributed to him.

==Life==
Godric&#x27;s life was recorded by a contemporary of his, a monk named Reginald of Durham. Several other hagiographies are also extant. According to these accounts, Godric, who began from humble beginnings as the son of Ailward and Edwenna, &quot;both of slender rank and wealth, but abundant in righteousness and virtue&quot;. He began as a peddler and became an entrepreneur. &quot;[H]e was wont to wander with small wares around the villages and farmsteads of his own neighbourhood; but, in process of time, he gradually associated himself by compact with city merchants.&quot;

Then he was a ship&#x27;s captain and part owner of two ships, one of which may have conveyed Baldwin I of Jerusalem to Jaffa in 1102. After many pilgrimages around the Mediterranean, Godric found himself off the Farne Islands near Lindisfarne and there was inspired to change his life.

Godric returned to England and lived at Wolsingham with an elderly hermit named Aelric (†1107) for two years. Upon Aelric&#x27;s death, Godric made one last pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and then returned home where he convinced Ranulf Flambard, the Bishop of Durham, to grant him a place to live as a hermit at Finchale, by the River Wear. He had previously served as doorkeeper, the lowest of the minor orders, at the hospital church of nearby St Giles Hospital in Durham. At Finchale he cleared forests to build a wooden oratory dedicated to the Virgin Mary; later he constructed a stone chapel dedicated to St John the Baptist.

He is recorded to have lived at Finchale for the final sixty years of his life, occasionally meeting with visitors approved by the local prior. As the years passed, his reputation grew, and Thomas Becket and Pope Alexander III both reportedly sought Godric&#x27;s advice as a wise and holy man.
Reginald describes Godric&#x27;s physical attributes:

St Godric is perhaps best remembered for his kindness toward animals, and many stories recall his protection of the creatures who lived near his forest home. According to one of these, he hid a stag from pursuing hunters; according to another, he even allowed snakes to warm themselves by his fire. Godric lived on a diet of herbs, wild honey, acorns, crab-apples and nuts. He slept on the bare ground.

Reginald of Durham recorded four songs of St Godric&#x27;s: they are the oldest songs in English for which the original musical settings survive. Reginald describes the circumstances in which Godric learnt the first song. In a vision the Virgin Mary appeared to Godric with at her side &quot;two maidens of surpassing beauty clad in shining white raiments.&quot; They pledged to come to his aid in times of need; and the Virgin herself taught Godric a song of consolation to overcome grief or temptation (&quot;Saintë Marië Virginë&quot;).

The novel &quot;Godric&quot; (1981) by Frederick Buechner is a fictional retelling of his life and travels. It was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize.

A tune named for him by its composer, John Bacchus Dykes, appears in dozens of hymnals.

<text>Sahim Alwan is a Yemeni-American who grew up in the suburbs of Buffalo, New York. In 2002, he was arrested and charged as part of the War on Terror together with the other members of the &quot;Lackawanna Six&quot;, based on the fact the group of friends had attended an Afghan training camp together a year earlier.

Like the others, although initially entering a plea of &quot;not guilty&quot;, he eventually pleaded guilty to &quot;providing material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization&quot;. He was convicted and received a 9.5-year sentence.

==Life==
Described as the &quot;clean-cut&quot; son of a steelworker, Alwan was noted for always wearing a shirt and tie, every day of his adult life, and studied criminal justice at the local community college. During the Gulf War, he and a group of friends were assaulted for their ethnicity outside a Lackawanna restaurant.

In the late 1990s, while working for Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, he cooperated with the FBI to help investigate a fraud case, and asked them about the possibility of working for them as a career.

A &quot;local success story&quot;, he maintained a stable marriage, had three children, and worked with the Iroquois Job Corps Center to help employ indigent and troubled youth.

At al-Farooq training camp he was discouraged by the fact they were training for offensive wars and wars against fellow Muslims, rather than in defence of Muslim populations. He announced that he wanted to leave and return home. He met personally with Osama bin Laden, who wanted to convince him to stay and finish his training. Taher, Moseb and Galeb also decided to leave. They were all driven to Quetta, and rather than wait a day for the next plane, took a bus to Karachi so they could leave Pakistan immediately.

Immediately following the September 11th attacks, Alwan was interviewed as a man on the street by the Buffalo News as he left his mosque, to give his opinion on the attacks. He responded that Islam guaranteed hellfire to anyone who took part in a suicide mission. He phoned agent Ed Needham at the FBI that night, to promise his full cooperation in the Muslim community if the FBI needed help.

<text>69 (sixty-nine; ) is the natural number following 68 and preceding 70. An odd number and a composite number, 69 is divisible by 1, 3, 23 and 69.

The number and its pictograph give its name to the sexual position of the same name. The association of the number with this sex position has resulted in it being associated in meme culture with sex. People knowledgeable of the meme may respond &quot;nice&quot; in response to the appearance of the number, whether intentionally an innuendo or not.

==In mathematics==
69 is a semiprime because it is a natural number that is the product of exactly two prime numbers (3 and 23), and it is an interprime between the numbers of 67 and 71. 69 is not divisible by any square number other than 1, making it a square-free integer. 69 is a Blum integer since the two factors of 69 are both Gaussian primes, and an Ulam number—an integer that is the sum of two distinct previously occurring Ulam numbers in a sequence. 69 is a deficient number because the sum of its proper divisors (which excludes itself) is less than itself. As an integer for which the arithmetic mean average of its positive divisors is also an integer, 69 is an arithmetic number. 69 is a congruent number—a positive integer that is the area of a right triangle with three rational number sides—and an amenable number. 69 can be expressed as the sum of consecutive positive integers in multiple ways, making it a polite number. 69 is a lucky number because it is a natural number that remains after repeatedly removing every &quot;n&quot;th number in a sequence of natural numbers, starting from 1.

In decimal, 69 is the only natural number whose square () and cube () use every digit from 0–9 exactly once. It is also the largest number whose factorial is less than a googol. On many handheld scientific and graphing calculators, 69! (1.711224524) is the highest factorial that can be calculated due to memory limitations. In its binary expansion of 1000101, 69 is equal to 105 octal, while 105 is equal to 69 hexadecimal (this same property can be applied to all numbers from 64 to 69). In computing, 69 equates to 2120 in ternary (base-3); 153 in senary (base-6); and 59 in duodecimal (base-12).

Visually, in Arabic numerals, 69 is a strobogrammatic number because it looks the same when viewed both right-side and upside down. 69 is a centered tetrahedral number, a figurate number that represents a pyramid with a triangular base and all other points arranged in layers above the base, forming a tetrahedron shape. 69 is also a pernicious number because there is a prime number of 1s when it is written as a binary number, and an odious number as it is a positive integer that has an odd number of 1s in its binary expansion.

==In culture==
69ing is a sex position wherein each partner aligns themselves to simultaneously achieve oral sex with each other. In reference to this sex act, the number 69 itself has become an Internet meme as an inherently funny number in which users will respond to any occurrence of the number with the word &quot;nice&quot; to draw specific attention to it. This means to humorously imply that the reference to the sex position was intentional. Because of its association with the sex position and resulting meme, 69 has been named &quot;the sex number&quot;.

<text>Yahya Goba is a Yemeni-American who grew up in the suburbs of Buffalo, New York. In 2002, he was arrested and charged as part of the War on Terror together with the other members of the &quot;Lackawanna Six&quot;, based on the fact that he and a group of friends had attended an Afghan training camp together a year earlier.

==Life==
When Kamal Derwish moved back to Lackawanna in 2000, he lived with his uncle until Goba volunteered to split an apartment with him. Derwish then began holding regular get-togethers at the apartment, where a group of upwards to 25 young Muslim men would get together to discuss religion and eat pizza. Goba and Jaber Elbaneh tended to &quot;compete&quot; for the attention and favour of Derwish, who spoke of his travels abroad and ostensible history fighting in Palestine. He applied for a new passport, noting that his old one had been destroyed after being thrown in the washing machine in a shirt pocket. Authorities believe and have averred that he was trying to erase incriminating visa stamps marking his overseas visits.

<text>The Lackawanna Six (also known as the Lackawanna Cell, or Buffalo Cell) is a group of six Yemeni-American friends who pled guilty to charges of providing material support to al-Qaeda in December 2003, based on their having attended an al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan together in the Spring of 2001 (before 9/11 and the US invasion of Afghanistan). The suspects were facing likely convictions with steeper sentences under the &quot;material support law&quot;.

Friends from childhood, all six were born American citizens.

==Background==

The six men traveled from the United States to Afghanistan in spring 2001, before the September 11 attacks, while the country was still ruled by the Taliban. Its leaders were giving sanctuary to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian leader of al-Qaeda who used the base for training.

In June 2001, an anonymous two-page handwritten letter was received from an individual ostensibly living in Lackawanna who knew the immigrant Yemeni population intimately. It warned, &quot;I am very concern. I am an Arab-American... and I cannot give you my name because I fear for my life. Two terrorist came to Lackawanna... for recruiting the Yemenite youth... the terrorist group... left to Afghanistan to meet... bin Laden and stay in his camp for training&quot;, and gave the names of twelve local youths.

The group visited what later became known in the American media as the &quot;al-Farooq terrorist training camp.&quot; That year, they returned to the United States.

In the late summer of 2002, one of the members, Mukhtar al-Bakri, sent an e-mail message in which he described his upcoming wedding in Yemen, and another in which he mentioned a &quot;big meal&quot; after the wedding, which is traditional in Islam. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who were monitoring him, sounded the alarm and al-Bakri was arrested by Bahraini police on the date of his wedding in September 2002. They found him in his hotel room with his new wife, where he was taken into custody by a Special Security Force Command tactical team.

The other five were arrested in Lackawanna, New York, a suburb of Buffalo, New York in September 2002. On September 14, 2002, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) held a press conference in Buffalo to announce the arrests of five of the local Al Qaeda suspects. The FBI Special Agent in charge of the investigation, Peter Ahearn (At the time head of the FBI&#x27;s Buffalo Field Office), stated that there was no specific event triggering the arrests, which followed four to eight months of investigations. Assisting with this investigation were members of the Ontario Provincial Police, Niagara Falls Casino Enforcement who also identified the suspects while conducting large cash transactions in the Niagara Casino. Later, FBI counterterrorism chief Dale Watson told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the bureau acted as &quot;we are probably 99 percent sure that we can make sure these guys don&#x27;t do something – if they are planning to do something.&quot; Watson paraphrased the President&#x27;s response as that &quot;under the rules that we were playing under at the time, that&#x27;s not acceptable. So a conscious decision was made, &#x27;Let&#x27;s get &#x27;em out of here&#x27;.&quot;

==Associates==
Jaber A. Elbaneh, a close associate of the Lackawanna Six, never returned to the U.S. after his trip to Afghanistan. In September 2003, the FBI announced a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest. He escaped from a Yemeni prison, one of 23 people, 12 of them al-Qaeda members, who escaped on February 3, 2006. A few days later he was added to the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list. On May 20, 2007, Elbaneh turned himself in to Yemen authorities on the condition that his prison sentence would not be extended.

Ahmed Hijazi &quot;aka&quot; Jalal &quot;aka&quot; Kamal Derwish may have been the ringleader/recruiter of the Lackawanna Six, and was sought after because investigators believed he could clarify the severity of the threat posed by them. Although not born in the U.S., he held U.S. citizenship. He was killed by a CIA Predator drone in Yemen on November 3, 2002. The Hellfire targeted killing also killed five others in the same car - including a senior al-Qaeda leader, Abu Ali al-Harithi who is suspected of being involved in the planning of the October 2000 attack on the destroyer .

==Trials==
An anonymous voice message was being sent to households across Lackawanna, ostensibly from &quot;BioFend&quot;, noting that &quot;we believe that the goal of this terrorist cell was to detonate briefcase-sized dirty bombs right here in Western New York&quot;. When then-Governor Eliot Spitzer had the company dissolved, it was still unclear whether the recordings were meant to lay the groundwork for a financial scam, or were an attempt to &quot;taint the jury pool&quot; by spreading untrue rumors suggesting there had been a violent plan in the works.

Though all six initially entered pleas of &quot;not guilty&quot;, they all eventually pleaded guilty to &quot;providing material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.&quot; One of their defense lawyers suggested that they had been intimidated by threats of being declared enemy combatants. None of the six had been accused of planning or engaging in terrorist acts.

Yahya Goba and Mukhtar al-Bakri received 10-year prison sentences. Yaseinn Taher and Shafal Mosed received 8-year prison sentences. Sahim Alwan received a 9.5-year sentence. Faysal Galab received a 7-year sentence. All sentences were for single counts of &quot;providing support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization&quot;. In discussing the plea bargain agreements, US prosecutors commented the defendants had cooperated with federal terrorism investigators, providing detailed information on al-Qaeda membership, training, and methods. 

==Guantanamo testimony==
In late October 2008, three of the six men testified at the Guantanamo military commission&#x27;s review of Ali Hamza al Bahlul actions.
Yassein Taher, Sahim Alwan and a third member of the group (not identified to the press) testified they had been shown a two-hour jihadist video that celebrated the attack on the USS &quot;Cole&quot; during the period when they were in al Qaeda guest houses and when they attended the al Farouq training camp.

Al Bahlul was charged with producing the jihadist video for recruiting members to al-Qaeda. The Buffalo men testified that they were terrified and appalled by the video. According to the journalist Carol Rosenberg of the &quot;Miami Herald,&quot; Taher and Alwan expected their testimony would be rewarded by their being placed in the witness protection program. The third man, whose name was withheld from the press, was already in the protection program.

==Proposed capture by United States Army troops==
In July 2009, the media reported that local officials had suggested that federal troops be used to capture the suspects, rather than sending in 130 federal and local members of the Western New York Joint Terrorism Task Force. At the time, Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld believed that the men should be declared enemy combatants and tried by a military tribunal. President Bush rejected this proposal, and the arrests proceeded without incident; they were tried in criminal court.

<text>Shafal Mosed is a Yemeni-American who grew up in the suburbs of Buffalo, New York.

==Life==
Born in Detroit, Michigan, Mosed moved to Lackawanna as a child when his father&#x27;s automotive job with Ford Motor Company was relocated to the Buffalo plant.

When his father died of a heart attack, Mosed was left in charge of caring for his sickly mother and three younger siblings. The family lived in poverty, as Mosed worked as a telemarketer and took computer courses at the local community college.

Taher, Moseb and Galeb all decided to leave together after Sahim Alwan made it clear he wanted to return home and was unhappy with the tone of the camp. They were driven to Quetta, and rather than wait a day for the next plane, took a bus to Karachi so they could leave Pakistan immediately.

<text>Godric is the tenth novel by the American author and theologian, Frederick Buechner. Set in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the novel tells the semi-fictionalised life story of the medieval Roman Catholic saint, Godric of Finchale. It was first published in 1980 by Atheneum, New York, and was a finalist for the 1981 Pulitzer Prize.

== Plot summary ==
Godric of Finchale is joined at his hermitage on the banks of the River Wear by Reginald, a monk sent by the abbot of Rievaulx Abbey with instructions to record the aging saint’s biography. The arrival of the enthusiastic young monk plunges Godric back into his past, and he unflinchingly narrates the ribald tale of his own history, which is carefully edited by Reginald and set down in restrained and laudatory prose more befitting of the life of a saint.

Having survived a near drowning in the sea at a young age, Godric leaves home for a life of petty crime – selling counterfeit relics and the ostensibly holy hair of nuns. Following a dreamlike encounter on the Island of Farne with an apparition who identifies himself as Saint Cuthbert, Godric appears set to spend his life seeking God. His meeting with the roguish Roger Mouse, however, puts paid to any notion of quests for personal holiness. The two embark upon a life of crime and villainy aboard their boat, the &quot;Saint Espirit&quot;, where they hatch a series of schemes to defraud pilgrims journeying to the Holy Land and commit acts of piracy, all the while hoarding their growing stockpile of treasure.

While attempting to bury his ill-gotten gains, Godric encounters once more the apparition of Saint Cuthbert, a sobering and chastening experience for the prodigal. On returning home following his misadventures Godric discovers that his father has died in his absence. Determined to fulfil his last wish, the bereaved young man begins a pilgrimage to Rome, only to find the Holy City a disappointment: ‘a corpse without a shroud’.

It is on the journey home, however, that Godric encounters God, following a transformative encounter with a wise maiden, Gillian, which convicts him of his past offences. Committing himself to a life of penitence and seclusion, Godric begins a second pilgrimage, this time to the ancient Holy City, Jerusalem. Upon reaching the River Jordan he rushes into its waters and is baptised. After a number of years spent in the service of Ranulph Flambard, Bishop of Durham, Godric espies a likely spot for a hermitage on the banks of the River Wear. No longer a young man, the hermit determines to spend the rest of his days humbly in this rural spot.

The ensuing fifty years are punctuated by the arrival of notable guests, pilgrims, and penance in the icy waters of the river. Reginald’s optimistic probing into the life of the saint of Finchdale reveal more than he had bargained for, as the aging hermit bitterly reveals that his miracles, wisdom, and good deeds are tempered by the hard realities of sin, murder, and even incest.

== Main characters ==

* Godric: Based on the historical figure of Godric of Finchale, a twelfth-century monk and mystic, Buechner’s aging saint is beset by his past, a past that is crowded by miracles and misdeeds, beatific visions and vices, healings and incest. In his autobiographical work, &quot;Now and Then&quot; (1983), Buechner offers the following assessment of Godric’s life and character:He had been a peddler before he turned hermit, and master of a merchant ship. He had tried his hand at piracy for a while. He had rescued Baldwin the First, King of Jerusalem, at the time of the First Crusade. He had not considered himself a saint at all and for that reason balked at giving his blessing to the excessively reverent biography that a contemporary monk called Reginald of Durham was writing about him.Hidden away in his secluded hermitage, Godric suffers the visitations of admiring pilgrims and the devotions of his biographer, Reginald. God, his pet snakes Fairweather and Tune, and the River Wear are his constant companions in conversation as he reminisces, at times darkly and at times wistfully, about humanity, his life, and the life to come, coming to the conclusion that: ‘nothing human’s not a broth of false and true’.
* Reginald: an enthusiastic young monk, Reginald of Durham is given the daunting task of documenting the life of Godric for church history and posterity. The biographer studiously ignores both the shadier elements of Godric’s story and the saint’s darker reflections on life and the nature of sainthood, while also rebuffing his attempts to thwart the process of documentation. He blithely creates an optimistic depiction of Godric’s life, and secures the old man’s reputation as a saintly servant of the church, the quest for holiness, and God.
* Burcwen: vivacious and irrepressible, Burcwen is Godric’s younger sister. Following their separation when Godric went off to sea and, subsequently, became a hermit, the two yearn for one another’s company. In their loneliness, pain, and confusion, they fall victim to their passions and vulnerability and commit incest together. Heartbroken by her fall from grace, Burcwen commits herself to a life as a nun, and is only seen once more by Godric, though from a distance.
* Rodger Mouse: Godric’s companion at sea, Rodger Mouse is the protagonist of their misadventures. From their boat, the &quot;Saint Espirit&quot;, the two commit acts of kidnap, piracy, looting, and rape, taking advantage of pilgrims headed to the Holy Land. Despite his corrupting influence upon Godric, the aged saint retains a great deal of affection for his old companion, praying for him regularly, and reflecting on the life lessons he imparted during their time at sea.

== Composition ==
&quot;Godric&quot; was composed by Buechner while in full residence at his family home in Vermont, shortly after the publication of &quot;The Book of Bebb&quot;. In his autobiographical work, &quot;Now and Then&quot; (1983), Buechner reveals that the novel was authored after his children had left home, and thus represents the beginning of a new life chapter: &#x27;for me&#x27;, he writes, &#x27;it shook the very foundations themselves and marked the beginning of a new leg of the journey which I am in the midst of still.

The author&#x27;s discovery of the character of Godric was similar to that of Leo Bebb. In &quot;Now and Then&quot; he writes: &#x27;I picked up a small paperback book of saints and opened it, by accident, to the page that had Godric on it. I had never so much as heard of him before, but as I read about him, I knew he was for me, my saint.&#x27;

== Themes ==

Though Buechner returns to the first person narrative style first utilised in the &quot;Bebb&quot; tetralogy, &quot;Godric&quot; appears to have brought with it new challenges to the author. His first foray into period literature, Buechner admits to having grappled somewhat with the problem of creating a prose that evoked medieval England while remaining accessible. In &quot;Now and Then&quot; he writes that, &#x27;despite the problem of developing a language that sounded authentic on his lips without becoming impenetrably archaic&#x27; the novel was still quickly and easily completed.

For Buechner, &quot;Godric&quot; also represents a fresh reengagement with several substantial themes, many of which are discussed elsewhere in his literature. Among them are sin, the search for identity, faith, and the supernatural. At the forefront, however, and certainly more so than in any of Buechner’s previous novels, is an investigation of death and ageing: Godric is a very old man as he tells his tale, and old age and the approach of death are very much in the back of his mind throughout. In this sense I think it was a book as prophetic, for me, as the Bebb books had been. It was prophetic in the sense that in its pages, more than half without knowing it, I was trying on various ways of growing old and facing death myself. As the years go by, Godric outlives, or is left behind by, virtually everybody he has ever loved––his sister, Burcwen; his shipmate, Roger Mouse; the two snakes, Tune and Fairweather, who for years were his constant companions; and the beautiful maid, Gillian, who appeared to him on the way back from his pilgrimage to Rome. But, although not without anguish, he is able to let them all go finally and to survive their going. His humanity and wit survive. His faith survives. &quot;Godric&quot; is told in Saint Godric&#x27;s own voice: Buechner intentionally uses style, tone, and word choice to evoke a &quot;mediaeval&quot; manner of speaking. The book unfolds with Godric narrating the events of his life in retrospect, as he looks back on his hundred years of life and does not see the saintly existence that many ascribe to him.

As a historical novel it provides a gateway for understanding mediaeval history with the full breadth of imagination, characterisation and emotion in which non-fiction history is restricted. Some of the historical themes Buechner depicts in the book include blood libels, pilgrimage, Christian asceticism, hagiography, traveling court culture, and Norman and Saxon relations.

== Critical reception ==

In addition to being a finalist for the 1981 Pulitzer Prize, &quot;Godric&quot; received critical acclaim. Buechner himself has noted his love of the novel, remarking that: ‘If I were to be remembered by only one book, this is the one I would choose. In every way it came unbidden, unheralded, as a blessing.&#x27; Literary critic Dale Brown agrees with the author’s preference for &quot;Godric&quot;, writing that his ‘thirty-year apprenticeship yields and unquestionable masterpiece’. He continues: &quot;&#x27;Godric&quot; is one of those great books, the kind where we prolong the reading, dread turning that last page, because the journey has been so musical, the journey so complete as to rearrange the chords of our inner lives, the kind of book that makes you want to run up to strangers and ask them if they’ve read it.&#x27;

Concerning the prose style that Buechner crafted in order to fully render his twelfth-century protagonist and the world within which he moved, Brown also writes:Buechner recreates a Saxon feel for his novel, a twelfth-century visitation featuring pre-French-Latinate vocabulary. Although the Anglo-Saxon language is often archaic, context usually provides the sense, and most readers settle into the prose as part of the pleasure of the book. From the major news organs to book review pages all across the country, readers were remarkably effusive in their acclaim, and &quot;all&quot; of them mentioned the language as part of the triumph.The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; review of &quot;Godric&quot; certainly focused in on the author’s prose style, concluding that, &#x27;With a poet’s sensibility and a high, reverent fancy, Mr. Buechner paints a memorable portrait.&#x27; Likewise, the reviewer for &quot;Booklist&quot; referred to the ‘Chaucerian exuberance’ of the novel, while Peter Lewis declared it to be a ‘picaresqe narrative’, and a ‘stylistic tour de force’, formed out of language that is ‘neither ancient nor modern but a bit of both cleverly combined.’ Writing for &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Lewis offers further comment on the protagonist of the novel, writing that: ‘In the extraordinary figure of Godric, both stubborn outsider and true child of God, both worldly and unworldly, Buechner has found an ideal means of exploring the nature of spirituality’. In his review, published in &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, Benjamin DeMott presented the author as a ‘major talent’: ‘Frederick Buechner’, he wrote, ‘is a very good writer indeed’. Concerning the novel itself, the reviewer added: &#x27;]All on his own, Mr. Buechner has managed to reinvent projects of self-purification and of faith as piquant matter for contemporary fiction [in a book] notable for literary finish&#x27;.

The novel has also drawn praise from several notable academics and authors. Novelist Tony Abbott wrote that ‘&quot;Godric&quot; is absolutely astounding, and no matter how many times you read it, it is still moving,’ and Revd Dr Michael Lloyd, principal of Wycliffe Hall, University of Oxford, suggested that &quot;The first line of &quot;Godric&quot; is one of the best in all of literature.’ In an article written for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, reviewer Peter S. Prescott also noted the power of the novel’s opening line: ‘From the book’s opening sentence’, he writes, ‘any sensible reader will be caught in Godric’s grip.’ He continues:Like all good writers of historical fiction, Buechner strives less for verisimilitude than for a vision of the past. […] In telling his long story in such a short space, and from both of its ends at once, Buechner glides deftly from the fanciful to scenes that are nearly realistic […] Buechner has risked much in attempting to define the ambivalences in the life of a saintly man, and risked even more by adopting a language that could easily have become overwrought […] Godric glimmers brightly.In addition to that of reviewers, &quot;Godric&quot; has also met with approval from literary academics. In her work, &quot;Listening to Life: psychology and spirituality in the writings of Frederick Buechner&quot;, Victoria S. Allen affirms the ‘literary excellence’ of the novel, writing that ‘the literary quality of &quot;Godric&quot; stands on its own.’ Allen points beyond literary questions to the psychological nature of Buechner’s craft, writing that: ‘In &quot;Godric&quot; Frederick Buechner’s psychological spirituality finds its ultimate literary expression as an old monk listens to his life.’ She further adds that, ‘the use of first-person narration and a natural presentation of the inner dynamics of psychotherapy and spirituality produced a work both secular and religious readers found remarkable.’ Marjorie Casebier McCoy’s investigation into the work of Buechner, &quot;Frederick Buechner: novelist and theologian of the lost and found&quot;, also features an extensive study of &quot;Godric&quot;. McCoy suggests that the novel ‘reminds us of all that has gone before in Buechner’s writing’, while insisting that ‘this book must be viewed in a class unto itself among the novels.’ &quot;Godric&quot;, she writes, &#x27;has all the Buechner ability to draw us into a storied world, to make us listen to the characters and discover that they are talking directly to us, and to compel us to take even the impossible possibility of God and faith in God with complete seriousness&#x27;. McCoy concludes by proffering what she perceives as the chief ‘insight’, unearthed by Buechner with ‘sensitivity and brilliance’ in &quot;Godric&quot;: ‘The distinctiveness of Buechner’, she writes, ‘is that he not only knows the theological power of metaphors in stories told with artistic force and set within a comprehensive religious vision’.

<text>Yaseinn Taher is a Yemeni-American who grew up in the suburbs of Buffalo, New York. In 2002, he was arrested and charged under Title 18 of the US Code, together with the other members of the &quot;Lackawanna Six&quot;, based on the fact the group of friends had attended an Afghan training camp together a year earlier.

==Early life and education==
The Taher household was not considered devoutly Muslim, although they forbade their children to date, they also exchanged gifts for Christmas and weren&#x27;t &quot;regulars&quot; at mosque worship services.

Taher was captain of the Lackawanna Steelers soccer team, and dated the cheerleader Nicole Frick, whose Catholic parents approved of him since he seemed &quot;more white&quot; than most Muslim-Americans living in the area.

At his 1996 graduation, he was voted &quot;friendliest&quot; person of the graduating class. He attended community college, while working odd jobs and living with his parents.

His maternal uncle, Abdulsalam Noman, was a Lackawanna City Council member and soccer coach at Lackawanna High School. Noman largely dealt with media outlets when the Buffalo Six were discovered.

== Marriage ==
In 1998, when Nicole informed him she was pregnant, the 18-year-old Taher arranged a hasty Islamic wedding in his parents&#x27; living room.

Since Catholicism and Islam both allowed the marriage, on the basis that any children born to the union must be raised in &quot;their&quot; faith, Nicole and Taher argued over whether to raise &quot;Noah&quot; in the Catholic or Muslim faith. Taher subsequently became more religious, and began attending communal prayers every day, and discouraged provocative clothing and television. Nicole ostensibly converted to Islam after the birth of Noah, but still fought with Taher for increasing secularism.

== Meetings with jihadists ==
Like his friends, Taher began attending regular get-togethers at the Wilkes Barre apartment of Kamal Derwish, who had also grown up in the area, but had traveled overseas and spoke of fighting with the insurgency in Palestine and encouraged the friends to consider a Muslim&#x27;s duty to defend the weak and innocent. At one point, he disagreed with Derwish, noting that although jihad may be the correct path in Muslim nations attacked by outsiders, he could not support something like the USS Cole bombing which took place in Yemen, a country that had not been invaded.

== Afghanistan ==
Taher and six others traveled to Al Farooq training camp in Afghanistan in the spring and summer of 2001, weeks before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

== Return to USA ==
Six of the seven returned to the US including Taher, Moseb and Galeb. They decided to leave together after Sahim Alwan made it clear he wanted to return home and was unhappy with the tone of the camp. They were driven to Quetta, and rather than wait a day for the next plane, took a bus to Karachi so they could leave Pakistan immediately. During questioning upon their return four of the six men said they were coming back to the US from attending religious seminars in Pakistan. None mentioned the trip to Pakistan until Mukhtar al-Bakri was arrested in Bahrain and questioned by FBI agents on September 11, 2002.

== Kidnapping ==
In September 2003 two men, Brett Bigalow and Timothy Fisher, were arrested and charged with extortion for kidnapping a man. The kidnappers demanded a $1 million ransom from a close relative of Taher, who subsequently contacted police after receiving the demand for ransom. The victim said his captors wanted to know where a seventh Lackawanna man- Jaber Elbaneh, was hiding. Elbaneh was a suspected terrorist whose whereabouts were sought by international police offering a $5 million reward if his location was revealed.

==Arrest==
Five of the Lackawanna Six men were arrested in September 2002 and held in a federal detention center after several FBI raids in the Buffalo, New York suburb of Lackawanna. The five were Yahya Goba, Sahim Alwan, Shafal Mosed, Yasein Taher, and Faysal Galab. Mukhtar al-Bakri was arrested in Bahrain, brought to the US and charged with providing material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations, known as Title 18 of the US Code. The others were charged with the same violation of US law.

==Trial==
In December 2003 Taher was sentenced to eight years in prison for supporting a terrorist organization. Taher, who was 25 years old at the time, pleaded guilty, admitting to attending the Farooq training camp run by Al Qaeda in the months leading up to the September 11 attacks. Taher and the other men admitted to training with weapons and explosives and doing guard duty at the camp. Each guilty plea could lead to a maximum ten-year sentence, but Taher&#x27;s sentence was reduced for cooperating with federal officials, and for presenting letters of support from family members, as well as showing remorse.

<text>Federico Faggin (, ; born 1 December 1941) is an Italian-American physicist, engineer, inventor and entrepreneur. He is best known for designing the first commercial microprocessor, the Intel 4004. He led the 4004 (MCS-4) project and the design group during the first five years of Intel&#x27;s microprocessor effort. Faggin also created, while working at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968, the self-aligned MOS (metal–oxide–semiconductor) silicon-gate technology (SGT), which made possible MOS semiconductor memory chips, CCD image sensors, and the microprocessor. After the 4004, he led development of the Intel 8008 and 8080, using his SGT methodology for random logic chip design, which was essential to the creation of early Intel microprocessors. He was co-founder (with Ralph Ungermann) and CEO of Zilog, the first company solely dedicated to microprocessors, and led the development of the Zilog Z80 and Z8 processors. He was later the co-founder and CEO of Cygnet Technologies, and then Synaptics.

In 2010, he received the 2009 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the highest honor the United States confers for achievements related to technological progress. In 2011, Faggin founded the Federico and Elvia Faggin Foundation to support the scientific study of consciousness at US universities and research institutes. In 2015, the Faggin Foundation helped to establish a $1 million endowment for the Faggin Family Presidential Chair in the Physics of Information at UC Santa Cruz to promote the study of &quot;fundamental questions at the interface of physics and related fields including mathematics, complex systems, biophysics, and cognitive science, with the unifying theme of information in physics.&quot;

==Education and early career==
Born in Vicenza, Italy, Federico grew up in an intellectual environment. His father, Giuseppe Faggin, was a scholar who wrote many academic books and translated, with commentaries, the Enneads of Plotinus from the original Greek into modern Italian. Federico had a strong interest in technology from an early age. He attended a technical high school in Vicenza, I.T.I.S. Alessandro Rossi, and later earned a &quot;laurea&quot; degree in physics, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, from the University of Padua.

===Olivetti R&amp;D Labs===
Faggin joined Olivetti at the age of 19. There he co-designed and led the implementation of a small digital transistor computer with 4 K × 12 bit of magnetic memory (1960). The Olivetti R&amp;D department subsequently developed one of the world&#x27;s first programmable desktop electronic calculators, the Olivetti Programma 101 (1964). After this first work experience, Faggin studied physics at the University of Padua and taught the electronics laboratory course for 3rd year physics students in the academic year 1965–1966.

===SGS-Fairchild===
In 1967, he joined SGS-Fairchild, in Italy, where he developed its first MOS metal-gate process technology and designed its first two commercial MOS integrated circuits. SGS sent him to California in 1968. When Fairchild sold SGS-Fairchild, Faggin accepted an offer to complete the development of the silicon-gate technology with Fairchild.

==Silicon Valley career==

===Fairchild Semiconductor===
The silicon-gate technology (SGT) is one of the most influential technologies to have fueled the progress of microelectronics since the MOSFET. Without the SGT, the first microprocessor could not have been made during 1970–1971.

In February 1968, Federico Faggin joined Fairchild Semiconductor in Palo Alto where he was the project leader of the MOS silicon-gate technology, a MOSFET with a silicon self-aligned gate, and the inventor of its unique process architecture. The SGT became the basis of all modern NMOS and CMOS integrated circuits. It made possible the creation of MOS semiconductor memory chips during 1969–1970, the first microprocessor during 1970–1971, and the first CCD and EPROM (electrically programmable read-only memory) with floating silicon gates (1970–1971). The SGT replaced the incumbent aluminum-gate MOS technology, and was adopted worldwide within 10 years, eventually making obsolete the original integrated circuits built with bipolar transistors.

===Fairchild 3708===
At Fairchild, Faggin designed the first commercial integrated circuit using silicon-gate technology with self-aligned MOSFET transistors: the Fairchild 3708. The 3708 was an 8-bit analog multiplexer with decoding logic, replacing the equivalent Fairchild 3705 that used metal-gate technology. The 3708 was 5 times faster, had 100 times less junction leakage and was much more reliable than the 3705, demonstrating the superiority of SGT over metal-gate MOS. See also: Faggin, F., Klein T. (1969). &quot;A Faster Generation of MOS Devices With Low Threshold Is Riding The Crest of the New Wave, Silicon-Gate IC&#x27;s&quot;. Electronics, 29 Sep. 1969.

===Intel===
Federico Faggin joined Intel from Fairchild in 1970 as the project leader and designer of the MCS-4 family of microprocessors, which included the 4004, the world&#x27;s first single-chip microprocessor. Fairchild was not taking advantage of the SGT and Faggin wanted to use his new technology to design advanced chips.

The 4004 (1971) was made possible by the advanced capabilities of the silicon gate technology (SGT) being enhanced through the novel random logic chip design methodology that Faggin created at Intel. It was this new methodology, together with his several design innovations, that allowed him to fit the microprocessor in one small chip. A single-chip microprocessor – an idea that was expected to occur many years in the future – became possible in 1971 by using SGT with two additional innovations: (1) &quot;buried contacts&quot; that doubled the circuit density, and (2) the use of bootstrap loads with 2-phase clocks—previously considered impossible with SGT— that improved the speed 5 times, while reducing the chip area by half compared with metal-gate MOS.

The design methodology created by Faggin was utilized for the implementation of all Intel&#x27;s early microprocessors and later also for Zilog&#x27;s Z80.

The Intel 4004 – a 4-bit CPU (central processing unit) on a single chip – was a member of a family of 4 custom chips designed for Busicom, a Japanese calculator manufacturer. The other members of the family (constituting the MCS-4 family) were: the 4001, a 2k-bit metal-mask programmable ROM with programmable input-output lines; the 4002, a 320-bit dynamic RAM with a 4-bit output port; and the 4003, a 10-bit serial input and serial/parallel output, static shift register to use as an I/O expander. Faggin promoted the idea of broadly marketing the MCS-4 to customers other than Busicom by showing Intel management how customers could design a control system using the 4004. He designed and built a 4004 tester using the 4004 as the controller of the tester, thus convincing Bob Noyce to renegotiate the exclusivity clause with Busicom that didn&#x27;t allow Intel to sell the MCS-4 line to other customers.

In 2009, the four contributors to the 4004 were inducted as Fellows of the Computer History Museum. Ted Hoff, head of Application Research Department, formulated the architectural proposal and the instruction set with assistance from Stan Mazor and working in conjunction with Busicom&#x27;s Masatoshi Shima. However, none of them was a chip designer and none was familiar with the new Silicon Gate Technology (SGT). The silicon design was the essential missing ingredient to making a microprocessor since everything else was already known. Federico Faggin led the project in a different department without Hoff&#x27;s and Mazor&#x27;s involvement. Faggin had invented the original SGT at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968 and provided additional refinements and inventions to make possible the implementation of the 4004 in a single chip. With routine help from Shima, Faggin completed the chip design in January 1971.

The Intel 2102A is a redesign of the Intel 2102 static RAM, where Federico Faggin introduced to Intel, for the first time, the depletion load, combining the silicon gate technology with ionic implantation. The design was done toward the end of 1973 by Federico Faggin and Dick Pashley. The 2102A was 5 times faster than the 2102, opening a new direction for Intel.

===Early Intel microprocessors===
Faggin&#x27;s silicon design methodology was used for implementing all Intel&#x27;s early microprocessors.

The Intel 8008 was the world&#x27;s first single-chip 8-bit CPU and, like the 4004, was built with p-channel SGT. The 8008 development was originally assigned to Hal Feeney in March 1970 but was suspended until the 4004 was completed. It was resumed in January 1971 under Faggin&#x27;s direction utilizing the basic circuits and methodology he had developed for the 4004, with Hal Feeney doing the chip design. The CPU architecture of the 8008 was originally created by CTC Inc. for the Datapoint 2200 intelligent terminal, in which it was implemented in discrete IC logic.

The Intel 4040 microprocessor (1974) was a much improved, machine-code-compatible version of the 4004 CPU allowing it to interface directly with standard memories and I/O devices. Federico Faggin created the architecture of the 4040 and supervised Tom Innes who did the design work.

The 8080 microprocessor (1974) was the first high-performance 8-bit microprocessor in the market, using the faster n-channel SGT. The 8080 was conceived and architected by Faggin, and designed by Masatoshi Shima under Faggin&#x27;s supervision. The 8080 was a major improvement over the 8008 architecture, yet it retained software compatibility with it. It was much faster and easier to interface to external memory and I/O devices than the 8008. The high performance and low cost of the 8080 let developers use microprocessors for many new applications, including the forerunners of the personal computer.

When Faggin left Intel at the end of 1974 to found Zilog with Ralph Ungermann, he was R&amp;D department manager responsible for all MOS products, except for dynamic memories.

===Zilog===
The Zilog Z80 was the first microprocessor created by Zilog, the first company entirely dedicated to microprocessors. It was started by Federico Faggin and Ralph Ungermann in November 1974. Faggin was Zilog&#x27;s president and CEO until the end of 1980 and he conceived and designed the Z80 CPU and its family of programmable peripheral components. He also co-designed the CPU whose project leader was Masatoshi Shima. 
The Z80-CPU was a major improvement over the 8080, yet it retained software compatibility with it. Much faster and with more than twice as many registers and instructions of the 8080, it was part of a family of components that included several intelligent peripherals (the Z80-PIO, a programmable parallel input-output controller; the Z80-CTC, a programmable counter-timer; the Z80-SIO, programmable serial communications interface controller, and the Z80-DMA, programmable direct memory access controller). This chip family allowed the design of powerful and low-cost microcomputers with performance comparable to minicomputers. The Z80-CPU had a substantially better bus structure and interrupt structure than the 8080 and could interface directly with dynamic RAM, since it included an internal memory-refresh controller. The Z80 was used in many of early personal computers, as well as in video game systems such as the MSX, ColecoVision, Master System and Game Boy. The Z80 ceased production in 2024.

The Zilog Z8 micro controller (1978) was one of the first single-chip microcontrollers in the market. It integrated an 8-bit CPU, RAM, ROM and I/O facilities, sufficient for many control applications. Faggin conceived the Z8 in 1974, soon after he founded Zilog, but then decided to give priority to the Z80. The Z8 was designed in 1976–78 and ended production in 2024.

===The Communication CoSystem===
The Communication CoSystem (1984). The Cosystem was conceived by Faggin and designed and produced by Cygnet Technologies, Inc., the second startup company of Faggin. Attached to a personal computer and to a standard phone line, the CoSystem could automatically handle all the personal voice and data communications of the user, including electronic mail, database access, computer screen transfers during a voice communication, call record keeping, etc. The patent covering the CoSystem is highly cited in the personal communication field.

===Synaptics===
In 1986 Faggin co-founded and was CEO of Synaptics until 1999, becoming chairman from 1999 to 2009. Synaptics was initially dedicated to R&amp;D in artificial neural networks for pattern-recognition applications using analog VLSI. Synaptics introduced the I1000, the world&#x27;s first single-chip optical character recognizer in 1991. In 1994, Synaptics introduced the touchpad to replace the cumbersome trackball then in use in laptop computers. The touchpad was broadly adopted by the industry. Synaptics also introduced the early touchscreens that were eventually adopted for intelligent phones and tablets; applications that now dominate the market. Faggin came up with the general product idea and led a group of engineers who further refined the idea through many brainstorming sessions. Faggin is a co-inventor of ten patents assigned to Synaptics. He is chairman emeritus of Synaptics.

===Foveon===
During his tenure as president and CEO of Foveon, from 2003 to 2008, Faggin revitalized the company and provided a new technological and business direction resulting in image sensors superior in all critical parameters to the best sensors of the competition, while using approximately half the chip size of competing devices. Faggin also oversaw the successful acquisition of Foveon by the Japanese Sigma Corporation in November 2008.

===Federico and Elvia Faggin Foundation===
Founded in 2011 the &quot;Federico and Elvia Faggin Foundation&quot; supports the scientific study of consciousness at US universities and research institutes. The purpose of the Foundation is to advance the understanding of consciousness through theoretical and experimental research. Faggin&#x27;s interest in consciousness has his roots in the study of artificial neural networks at Synaptics, a company he started in 1986, that prompted his inquiry into whether or not it is possible to build a conscious computer.

==The theory of consciousness==
In a book in (Mondadori, 2022) Federico Faggin proposed a theory of consciousness according to which consciousness is a purely quantum phenomenon, unique to each of us. This theory is supported by two quantum physics theorems: the no-cloning theorem and Holevo&#x27;s theorem. The first states that a pure quantum state is not reproducible; the second limits the amount of measurable information to one classical bit for each qubit that describes the state. Therefore, it is possible to postulate that a quantum system that is in a pure state is aware of its state, since conscious experiences (qualia) have all the essential properties of pure states, i.e., it is private knowledge only minimally knowable from the outside. However, the mathematical representation of the experience (the pure state) does not describe the experience, which remains private and knowable only from within by the system that is in that state. No classical machine can ever be conscious given that classical information is reproducible (program and data can be copied perfectly), while the quantum state is private. Consciousness is therefore not linked to the functioning of the body and can continue to exist even after the death of the body. The body behaves like a drone controlled &quot;top down&quot; by consciousness. The new D&#x27;Ariano-Faggin theory is based on the theoretical studies of Professor Giacomo D&#x27;Ariano&#x27;s studies, who derived quantum theory from informational principles , and on the experiential, philosophical and scientific studies of Federico Faggin on the nature of consciousness.

<doc id="378172" wikidata="Q1131345" url="?curid=378172" title="Warren Spahn">
<text>Warren Edward Spahn (April 23, 1921 – November 24, 2003) was an American professional baseball pitcher who played 21 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). A left-handed pitcher, Spahn played in 1942 and then from 1946 until 1965, most notably for the Boston Braves, who became the Milwaukee Braves after the team moved west before the season. His baseball career was interrupted by his military service in the United States Army during World War II.

With 363 career wins, Spahn holds the major league record for a left-handed pitcher, and has the most by a pitcher who played his entire career in the post-1920 live-ball era. He was a 17-time All-Star who won 20 games or more in 13 seasons, including a 23–7 win–loss record when he was age 42. Spahn won the 1957 Cy Young Award and was a three-time runner-up during the period when only one award was given for both leagues. At the time of his retirement in 1965, Spahn held the Major League record for career strikeouts by a left-handed pitcher.

Spahn was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1973, with 82.89% of the vote. The Warren Spahn Award, given annually to the major leagues&#x27; best left-handed pitcher, is named in his honor. Regarded as a &quot;thinking man&#x27;s&quot; pitcher who liked to outwit batters, Spahn once described his approach on the mound: &quot;Hitting is timing. Pitching is upsetting timing.&quot;

==Early life==
Spahn was born and raised in Buffalo, New York, to Edward and Mabel Spahn, the fifth of six children and the first of two sons. He was named after President Warren G. Harding and his father.

He attended Buffalo Bisons baseball games with his father and initially wanted to be a first baseman. However, when Spahn began to attend South Park High School, the first baseman position was already taken. Reluctantly, he took up pitching and led his high school team to two city championships, going undefeated his last two seasons, and throwing a no-hitter his senior year.

==Baseball career==

Spahn&#x27;s major league career began in 1942 with the Braves organization and he spent all but one year with that franchise, first in Boston and then in Milwaukee. He finished his career in 1965 with the New York Mets and the San Francisco Giants. With 363 wins, Spahn is the sixth most winning pitcher in history, trailing only Cy Young (511), Walter Johnson (417), Grover Cleveland Alexander (373), Christy Mathewson (373), and Pud Galvin (364) on MLB&#x27;s all-time list. He led the league in wins eight times (1949–50, 1953, 1957–1961, each season with 20+ wins) and won at least 20 games an additional five times (1947, 1951, 1954, 1956, 1963). 

Spahn also threw two no-hitters, in 1960 and 1961, at ages 39 and 40. He won three ERA titles (1947, 1953, and 1961), and four strikeout crowns (1949–1952). Spahn also appeared in 14 All-Star Games, the most of any pitcher in the 20th century. He won the NL Player of the Month Award in August 1960 (6–0, 2.30 ERA, 32 SO) and August 1961 (6–0, 1.00 ERA, 26 SO).

Spahn acquired the nickname &quot;Hooks&quot;, not so much because of his pitching, but due to the prominent shape of his nose. He had once been hit in the face by a thrown ball that he was not expecting, and his broken nose settled into a hook-like shape. In Spahn&#x27;s final season, during his stint with the Mets, Yogi Berra came out of retirement briefly and caught four games, one of them with Spahn pitching. Yogi later told reporters, &quot;I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re the oldest battery, but we&#x27;re certainly the ugliest.&quot;

Spahn was known for a very high leg kick in his delivery. Photo sequences show that this high kick served a specific purpose. As a left-hander, Spahn was able not only to watch any runner on first base, but also to avoid telegraphing whether he was delivering to the plate or to first base, thereby forcing the runner to stay close to the bag. As his fastball waned, Spahn adapted, and relied more on location, changing speeds and a good screwball. He led or shared the lead in the NL in wins in 1957–1961 (age 36–40).

Spahn was also a good hitter, hitting at least one home run in 17 straight seasons, and finishing with an NL career record for pitchers who do not play any other position, with 35 home runs. Wes Ferrell, who spent most of his time in the American League, holds the overall record for pitchers, with 37. Spahn posted a .194 batting average (363-for-1872) with 141 runs, 57 doubles, six triples, 94 bases on balls and 189 RBI. He also drove in 10 or more runs nine times, with a career-high 18 in 1951. In 1958 he batted a strong .333 (36-for-108). In eight World Series games, he batted .200 (4-for-20) with four RBI and a walk.

===Minor Leagues and brief call-up===
First signed by the Boston Braves, he reported to the Class-D Bradford Bees of the PONY League — later known as the NY-Penn League — after graduating high school. Spahn made his professional debut on July 6 at MacArthur Park (Dwyer Stadium) in Batavia, New York. Spahn took the loss against the Batavia Clippers pitching out of the bullpen where he walked two batters and struck out none. He finished the season with a 5–4 record and 2.73 ERA. In 1941, Spahn broke out and won 19 games against 6 losses with a 1.83 ERA while pitching for the Class-B Evansville Bees of the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League.

Spahn reached the major leagues in 1942 at the age of 20. He clashed with Braves manager Casey Stengel, who sent him back to the minors after Spahn refused to throw at Brooklyn Dodgers batter Pee Wee Reese in an exhibition game. Spahn had pitched in only 4 games, allowing 15 runs (10 earned) in 15.2 innings.

Stengel later said that it was the worst managing mistake he had ever made: &quot;I said &quot;no guts&quot; to a kid who went on to become a war hero and one of the greatest lefthanded pitchers you ever saw. You can&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t miss &#x27;em when I miss &#x27;em&quot;. The 1942 Braves finished next to last, and Stengel was fired the following year. Spahn was reunited with his first manager 23 years later, for the even more woeful last-place New York Mets, and—referring to Stengel&#x27;s success with the 1949–60 New York Yankees—later quipped, &quot;I&#x27;m probably the only guy who played for Casey before and after he was a genius.&quot;

Spahn finished the 1942 season with a 17–12 record for the Hartford Bees of the Class-A Eastern League.

==World War II==
Along with many other major leaguers, Spahn chose to enlist in the United States Army, after finishing the 1942 season in the minors. He served with distinction, and was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star. He saw action in the Battle of the Bulge and at the Ludendorff Bridge as a combat engineer, and was awarded a battlefield commission.

Spahn returned to the major leagues in 1946 at the age of 25, having missed three full seasons. Had he played, it is possible that Spahn would have finished his career behind only Walter Johnson and Cy Young in all-time wins. Spahn was unsure of the war&#x27;s impact on his career:

==Boston / Milwaukee Braves==
Spahn&#x27;s first full season as a starting pitcher came in 1947, when he led the National League in ERA (2.33), shutouts (7), and innings pitched () while posting a 21–10 record. It was the first of his thirteen 20-win seasons. Spahn also won two more ERA titles, in 1953 and 1961.

On June 11, 1950, Spahn and pitcher Bob Rush of the Cubs each stole a base against each other; no opposing pitchers again stole a base in the same game until May 3, 2004, when Jason Marquis and Greg Maddux repeated the feat.

In 1951, Spahn allowed the first career hit to Willie Mays, a home run. Mays had begun his career 0-for-12, and Spahn responded to reporters after the game, citing the distance between home plate and the pitcher&#x27;s mound of , &quot;Gentlemen, for the first 60 feet, that was a hell of a pitch.&quot; Spahn joked a long time later, &quot;I&#x27;ll never forgive myself. We might have gotten rid of Willie forever if I&#x27;d only struck him out.&quot; (In 1962, another Hall of Famer hit his first career home run off Spahn: Sandy Koufax, who only hit one other.)

===&quot;Pray for rain&quot;===

Spahn&#x27;s teammate Johnny Sain was the ace of the pennant-winning 1948 Braves staff, with a win–loss record of 24–15. Spahn went 15–12 while, contrary to legend, teammates Bill Voiselle (13–13), and Vern Bickford (11–5) also pitched well.

In honor of the pitching duo, &quot;Boston Post&quot; sports editor Gerald V. Hern wrote this poem which the popular media eventually condensed to &quot;Spahn and Sain and Pray for Rain&quot;:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
First we&#x27;ll use Spahn
then we&#x27;ll use Sain
Then an off day
followed by rain
Back will come Spahn
followed by Sain
And followed
we hope
by two days of rain.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The poem was inspired by the performance of Spahn and Sain during the Braves&#x27; 1948 pennant drive. The team swept a Labor Day doubleheader, with Spahn throwing a complete 14-inning win in the opener, and Sain pitching a shutout in the second game. Following two off days, it did rain. Spahn won the next day, and Sain won the day after that. Three days later, Spahn won again. Sain won the next day. After one more off day, the two pitchers were brought back, and won another doubleheader. The two pitchers had gone 8–0 in 12 days&#x27; time.

Other sayings have been derived from &quot;Spahn and Sain and pray for rain.&quot; For example, some referred to the 1993 San Francisco Giants&#x27; imbalanced rotation as &quot;Burkett and Swift and pray for snow drift.&quot;

In 1957, Spahn was the ace of the champion Milwaukee Braves. He pitched on two other Braves pennant winners, in 1948 and 1958. Spahn led the NL in strikeouts for four consecutive seasons, from 1949 to 1952 (tied with Don Newcombe in 1951), which includes a single-game high of 18 strikeouts in a 15-inning appearance on June 14, 1952.

During the 1957 World Series, Sal Maglie of the Yankees, ineligible to pitch in the series because he was acquired too late in the season, watched the games with Robert Creamer of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and made assessments of the players. When Spahn was pitching, Maglie observed that batters had to try to hit balls to the opposite field against Spahn, as he was more likely to get them out if they tried to pull the ball.
On July 2, 1963, facing the San Francisco Giants, the 42-year-old Spahn became locked into a storied pitchers&#x27; duel with 25-year-old Juan Marichal. The score was still 0–0 after more than four hours when Willie Mays hit a game-winning solo home run off Spahn with one out in the bottom of the 16th inning.

Marichal&#x27;s manager, Alvin Dark, visited the mound in the 9th, 10th, 11th, 13th, and 14th innings, and was talked out of removing Marichal each time. During the 14th-inning visit, Marichal told Dark, &quot;Do you see that man pitching for the other side? Do you know that man is 42 years old? I&#x27;m only 25. If that man is on the mound, nobody is going to take me out of here.&quot; Marichal ended up throwing 227 pitches in the complete game 1–0 win, while Spahn threw 201 in the loss, allowing nine hits and one walk.

Spahn threw his first no-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies on September 16, 1960, when he was 39. He pitched his second no-hitter the following year on April 28, 1961, against the Giants. During the last two seasons of his career, Spahn was the oldest active player in baseball. He lost this distinction for a single day: September 25, 1965, when 58-year-old Satchel Paige pitched three innings.

Spahn&#x27;s seemingly ageless ability caused Stan Musial to quip, &quot;I don&#x27;t think Spahn will ever get into the Hall of Fame. He&#x27;ll never stop pitching.&quot;

===Final season===
Following the 1964 season, after 25 years with the franchise, Spahn was sold by the Braves to the New York Mets. Braves manager Bobby Bragan predicted, &quot;Spahnie won&#x27;t win six games with the Mets.&quot; Spahn took on the dual role of pitcher and pitching coach. Spahn won four and lost 12 at which point the Mets put Spahn on waivers. He was put on waivers on July 15, 1965, and released on July 22, 1965. He signed with the San Francisco Giants, with whom he appeared in his final major league game on October 1, 1965, at the age of 44. With the Mets and Giants combined, he won seven games for the season—his last in the major leagues. 

===Career statistics===
In a 22-season major league career, Spahn posted a 363–245 win–loss record with 2,583 strikeouts and a 3.09 ERA in 5,243.2 innings pitched, including 63 shutouts and 382 complete games. His 2,583 career strikeouts were the most by a left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball history until he was later on surpassed by Mickey Lolich in .

His 363 career win total ranks sixth overall in major league history; it is also the most by a pitcher who played his entire career in the post-1920 live-ball era. Spahn still holds the major league record for most career wins by a left-handed pitcher. His 63 career shutouts is the highest total in the live-ball era and sixth highest overall.

==Later life==
Spahn managed the Tulsa Oilers for five seasons, winning 372 games from 1967 to 1971. His 1968 club won the Pacific Coast League championship. He also coached for the Mexico City Tigers, and pitched a handful of games there. He was a pitching coach with the Cleveland Indians, in the minor leagues for the California Angels, and for six years, with Japan&#x27;s Hiroshima Toyo Carp.

For many years he owned and ran the large Diamond Star Ranch south of Hartshorne, Oklahoma, before retiring to live near a golf course in Broken Arrow with his half-Cherokee wife LoRene (née Southard) with whom he had one child, a son named Gregory (1948–2022).

===Death===
Spahn died of natural causes at his home in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. He is interred in the Elmwood Cemetery in Hartshorne. After his death, a street was named after him in Buffalo, New York, Warren Spahn Way, that connects Abbott Road with Seneca Street, through Cazenovia Park, in the heart of South Buffalo. The street is near South Park High School, Spahn&#x27;s alma mater.

==Honors==
Spahn&#x27;s number 21 was retired by the Braves in 1965, soon after his retirement. He was selected for the all-time All-Star baseball team by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine in 1991, as the left-handed pitcher. The other selections were: outfielders Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, and Willie Mays; shortstop Cal Ripken, third baseman Mike Schmidt, second baseman Jackie Robinson, first baseman Lou Gehrig, catcher Mickey Cochrane, right-handed pitcher Christy Mathewson, relief pitcher Dennis Eckersley, and manager Casey Stengel.

Spahn was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1973 and became a charter member of both the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985, and the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 1991.

In 1999, he was ranked number 21 by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; on their list of &quot;Baseball&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players&quot;, and was also named one of the 30 players on the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Spahn at number 49 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

Spahn was inducted into the Braves Hall of Fame in 1999. A few months before his death, he attended the unveiling of a statue outside Atlanta&#x27;s Turner Field. When the Braves vacated Turner Field to move into their current home of Truist Park, the statue was moved, and now stands outside that ballpark. The statue depicts Spahn in the middle of one of his leg kicks.

The statue was created by Shan Gray, who has sculpted numerous other statues of athletes which stand in Oklahoma, including two others of Spahn. One statue resides at the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame located at the Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark and the other is located in Hartshorne, Oklahoma at the Hartshorne Event Center.

On April 4, 2009, the facilities of Broken Arrow Youth Baseball, in Spahn&#x27;s longtime home of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, were dedicated in his honor.

In their &quot;Naked Gun&quot; films, producers Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker sometimes included joke credits. The trio, who were Milwaukee-area natives, included Spahn in the closing credits once, with the disclaimer, &quot;He&#x27;s not in the film, but he&#x27;s still our all-time favorite left-hand pitcher.&quot;

Spahn also made his acting debut with a cameo appearance as a German soldier in a 1963 episode (S2E8 &quot;Glow Against the Sky&quot;) of the television series &quot;Combat!&quot;

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Spahn as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army during World War II.

<text>The National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum (also known as the 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum) is a memorial and museum that are part of the World Trade Center complex, in New York City, created for remembering the September 11, 2001, attacks, which killed 2,977 people, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six. The memorial is located at the World Trade Center site, the former location of the Twin Towers that were destroyed during the September 11 attacks. It is operated by a non-profit institution whose mission is to raise funds to program and operate the memorial and museum at the World Trade Center site.

A memorial was planned in the immediate aftermath of the attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center for the victims and those involved in rescue and recovery operations. The winner of the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition was Israeli-American architect Michael Arad of Handel Architects, a New York City and San Francisco–based firm. Arad worked with landscape-architecture firm Peter Walker and Partners on the design, creating a forest of swamp white oak trees with two square reflecting pools in the center marking where the Twin Towers stood.

In August 2006, the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey began heavy construction on the memorial and museum. The design is consistent with the original master plan by Daniel Libeskind, which called for the memorial to be below street level—originally —in a plaza, and was the only finalist to disregard Libeskind&#x27;s requirement that the buildings overhang the footprints of the Twin Towers. The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation was renamed the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum in 2007.

A dedication ceremony commemorating the tenth anniversary of the attacks was held at the memorial on September 11, 2011, and it opened to the public the following day. The museum was dedicated on May 15, 2014, with remarks from Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg and President Barack Obama. Six days later, the museum opened to the public.
==History==
===Planning===

Formerly the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum was formed as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation to raise funds and manage the memorial&#x27;s planning and construction. Its board of directors met for the first time on January 4, 2005, and it reached its first-phase capital-fundraising goal ($350 million) in April 2008. This money and additional funds raised will be used to build the memorial and museum and endow the museum.

In 2003, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation launched the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition, an international competition to design a memorial at the World Trade Center site to commemorate the lives lost on 9/11. Individuals and teams from around the world submitted design proposals. On November 19, 2003, the thirteen-member jury selected eight finalists. &quot;Reflecting Absence&quot;, designed by Michael Arad and Peter Walker, was chosen as the winning design on January 6, 2004. It consists of a field of trees interrupted by two large, recessed pools, the footprints of the Twin Towers. The deciduous trees (swamp white oaks) are arranged in rows and form informal clusters, clearings and groves. The park is at street level, above the Memorial Museum. The names of the victims of the attacks (including those from the Pentagon, American Airlines Flight 77, United Airlines Flight 93, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing) are inscribed on the parapets surrounding the waterfalls in an arrangement of &quot;meaningful adjacencies&quot;. On January 14, 2004, the final design for the World Trade Center site memorial was unveiled at a press conference in Federal Hall National Memorial.

As mandated by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC), the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation owns, operates and finances the &quot;Reflecting Absence&quot; Memorial and the Museum. John C. Whitehead, chair of the LMDC and the foundation, announced his resignation in May 2006 and was replaced at the LMDC by former president Kevin Rampe. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg replaced Whitehead as chair of the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum. Foundation executive committee chair Thomas S. Johnson said on May 9, 2006:

On May 26, 2006, Gretchen Dykstra resigned as president and chief executive officer of the World Trade Center Foundation. Joseph C. Daniels was appointed as president and CEO in October 2006. The memorial projects were toned down, and the budget was cut to $530 million. Despite delays, the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum was confident that it would be completed by September 11, 2011.

===National tour===
In September 2007, the Memorial &amp; Museum began a four-month national awareness tour of 25 cities in 25 states, and thousands participated in tour activities. The tour began at Finlay Park in Columbia, South Carolina, ending at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Florida. Highlights included an exhibition of photographs, artifacts from the site, and a film with firsthand accounts from individuals who had directly experienced the attacks. At the opening ceremony in South Carolina, the students of White Knoll Middle School (who raised over $500,000 in 2001 for a new truck for the New York City Fire Department) were honored, and retired New York City police officer Marcelo Pevida presented the city with an American flag that had flown over Ground Zero. The main attractions of the 2007 national tour were steel beams, later used in the construction of the memorial, for visitors to sign.

===Fundraising===

The National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum conducts a &quot;cobblestone campaign&quot;, in which a contributor may sponsor a cobblestone that will line the Memorial plaza. Donors are recognized on the Memorial&#x27;s website. Donors are able to locate their cobblestone by entering their name at a kiosk on the Memorial plaza. In 2008 the Memorial conducted two holiday cobblestone campaigns: the first for Father&#x27;s Day, and the second for the December holiday season.

On September 9, 2011, Secretary Shaun Donovan of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development said that the department had given $329 million to the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum through HUD&#x27;s Community Development Block Grant program. According to CNN, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey dropped its claim that the 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum owed it $300 million in construction costs in return for &quot;financial oversight of the museum and memorial&quot;.

Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii sponsored S.1537, the National September 11 Memorial and Museum Act of 2011, which would provide $20 million in federal funds annually toward the Memorial&#x27;s operating budget (about one-third of its total budget). The legislation was presented to the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on October 19, 2011. In return for federal funding S.1537 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to accept the donation by the memorial&#x27;s board of directors of title to the National September 11 Memorial, contingent on agreement by the board, the governors of New York and New Jersey, the Mayor of New York and the Secretary of the Interior. On October 19, 2011, William D. Shaddox of the National Park Service voiced concerns to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources about the agency&#x27;s ability to provide the funds required by S.1537, testifying that NPS ownership of a property over which it would not have operational and administrative control (as stipulated by S.1537) was unprecedented.

===Construction===

On March 13, 2006, construction workers arrived at the WTC site to begin work on the &quot;Reflecting Absence&quot; design. Some relatives of the victims and other concerned citizens gathered to protest the new memorial that day, saying that it should be built above ground. The president of the memorial foundation said that family members were consulted and formed a consensus in favor of the design, and work would continue as planned.
In May, estimated construction costs for the Memorial were reported to have risen to over $1 billion. In 2006, at the request of Bloomberg and Governor George Pataki, builder Frank Sciame performed a month-long analysis that included input from victims&#x27; families, the lower Manhattan business and residential communities, architects and members of the memorial-competition jury. The analysis recommended design changes that kept the memorial and museum within a $500 million budget.

In July 2008, the Survivors&#x27; Staircase was lowered to bedrock, making it the first artifact to be moved into the museum. By the end of August, the footings and foundations were completed. On September 2 construction workers raised the first column for the memorial, near the footprint of the North Tower. By then, about 70 percent of the construction contracts were awarded or ready to award. A total of of steel were installed at the memorial site. By April 2010, the reflecting pools were fully framed in steel, and 85 percent of the concrete had been poured. By April 22, workers had begun installation of the granite coating for the reflecting pools. By June the North Pool&#x27;s granite coating was completed, and workers had begun granite installation in the South Pool. In July, the first soil shipments arrived at the site, and in August workers began planting trees on the memorial plaza. The swamp white oaks can reach at maturity, live from 300 to 350 years, and their autumn leaves are gold-colored. The &quot;Survivor Tree&quot; is a callery pear that survived the devastation and was kept for replanting. In September, workers reinstalled two &quot;tridents&quot; salvaged from the Twin Towers.

In November 2010, workers began testing the North Pool waterfall. Construction progressed through early 2011: installation of glass panels on the museum pavilion&#x27;s facade began in March, and workers began testing the South Pool waterfall two months later. Most of the memorial was finished in time for the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, with the museum planned for completion the following year. By September 2, 243 trees were planted at the site and eight more were planted in the days before the memorial opened. By then, both pools were completed and the waterfalls were tested daily.

On September 12, 2011, one day after the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the memorial opened to the public with a lengthy set of rules and regulations approved by the foundation&#x27;s board of directors. The period from September 11, 2011, to May 25, 2014, was known as the &quot;interim operating period&quot;, when the memorial was surrounded by construction of neighboring World Trade Center projects; the fence was taken down on May 25, 2014. Three months after its opening, the memorial had been visited by over a million people.

==Design==
In January 2004, &quot;Reflecting Absence&quot;, by architect Michael Arad of Handel Architects and landscape architect Peter Walker, was selected from 5,201 entries from 63 countries as the winner of the LMDC&#x27;s design competition. Two pools with the largest man-made waterfalls in the United States comprise the footprints of the Twin Towers, symbolizing the loss of life and the physical void left by the attacks. The waterfalls are intended to mute the sounds of the city, making the site a contemplative sanctuary. Landscape architect Peter Walker planted many parts of the memorial with white oaks. More than 400 swamp white oak trees fill the Memorial plaza, enhancing the site&#x27;s reflective nature.

Pedestrian simulations tested the memorial&#x27;s design. The pedestrian-modeling program Legion was used to simulate visitor utilization of the space, and its design was tweaked to prevent bottlenecks. The fountain was engineered by Delta Fountains.

WSP Cantor Seinuk was the structural engineer, Jaros, Baum &amp; Bolles provided MEP engineering, and Lend Lease served as construction manager.

=== Arrangement of the victims&#x27; names ===

The names of 2,983 victims are inscribed on 152 bronze parapets on the memorial pools: 2,977 killed in the September 11 attacks and six killed in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The names are arranged according to an algorithm, creating &quot;meaningful adjacencies&quot; based on relationships—proximity at the time of the attacks, company or organization affiliations (for those working at the World Trade Center or the Pentagon) and in response to about 1,200 requests from family members. Software made by Local Projects implemented the arrangement. All names are written in Optima typeface, using small capitals, for a &quot;balanced appearance&quot;.

The names of the employees and visitors in the North Tower (WTC 1), the passengers and crew of American Airlines Flight 11 (which struck the North Tower), and the employees and a visitor of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing are around the perimeter of the North Pool. The names of the employees and visitors in the South Tower (WTC 2), the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 175 (which struck the South Tower), the employees, visitors, and bystanders in the immediate vicinity of the North and South Towers, the first responders who died during rescue operations, the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93 (which crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania) and American Airlines Flight 77 (which struck the Pentagon), and the employees at the Pentagon are around the perimeter of the South Pool. Company names are not included, but company employees and visitors are listed together. Passengers on the four flights are listed under their flight numbers, and first responders with their units.

The process for arranging the names was finalized in a 2006 agreement, replacing an earlier plan to arrange the names randomly. According to Edith Lutnick (executive director of the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund), &quot;Your loved ones&#x27; names are surrounded by the names of those they sat with, those they worked with, those they lived with and, very possibly, those they died with.&quot;

The six adult victims of the 1993 bombing are memorialized on Panel N-73 at the North Pool. The phrase &quot;and her unborn child&quot; follows the names of ten pregnant women who died on 9/11 and one who died in the 1993 attack.

=== The Survivor Tree ===
A callery pear tree recovered from the rubble at the World Trade Center site in October 2001 was later called the &quot;Survivor Tree&quot;. When the -tall tree was recovered, it was badly burned and had one living branch. The tree had been planted during the 1970s near buildings four and five, in the vicinity of Church Street. Then-Memorial president Joe Daniels described it as &quot;a key element of the memorial plaza&#x27;s landscape&quot;.

In November 2001, the tree was moved by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to the Arthur Ross Nursery in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx for care. It was then replanted in the Bronx on November 11, 2001. The tree was not expected to survive, but it showed signs of new growth the following spring. Although the memorial planning team intended to include the Survivor Tree, its permanent location was unknown at the time.

Still under the care of the Bronx nursery, the tree was replanted without significant damage in March 2010 after it was uprooted by a storm. After the replanting, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said: &quot;Again, we and the tree refused to throw in the towel. We replanted the tree, and it bounced back immediately.&quot; Also a few cuttings were taken from the original tree, which have become new trees themselves.

The Survivor Tree has become a symbol of hope and rebirth; according to Arthur Ross Nursery manager Richie Cabo, &quot;It represents all of us.&quot; In an August 29, 2011 Port Authority press release (after Hurricane Irene), Daniels said: &quot;True to its name, the Survivor Tree is standing tall at the Memorial.&quot; Keating Crown (a survivor of the attacks) said, &quot;It reminds us all of the capacity of the human spirit to persevere.&quot; &quot;A Place of Remembrance: Official Book of the National September 11 Memorial&quot; describes the tree as &quot;a reminder of the thousands of survivors who persevered after the attacks&quot;.

In December 2010, the tree, then tall, was returned to the World Trade Center site in a ceremony attended by Bloomberg, city officials (including Parks and Recreation Commissioner Adrian Benepe and Port Authority executive director Chris Ward), survivors and rescue and recovery workers. Although the tree is a prominent part of the memorial, six other &quot;survivor trees&quot; have been planted near New York City Hall and the Manhattan end of the Brooklyn Bridge. Of these survivor trees, three are callery pears and three are little-leaf lindens.

=== Memorial Glade ===
In May 2018, plans were revealed for a path through a &quot;memorial glade&quot; at the National September 11 Memorial. The glade and path honors first responders who later got sick or died after inhaling toxins at the World Trade Center site. According to 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum president Alice Greenwald and former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host Jon Stewart, the path was to be located on the southwest side of the memorial plaza, at the approximate site of a temporary ramp that first responders used during the cleanup effort. The path includes six large battered stones that, in the words of Michael Arad, &quot;appear to jut up and out of the plaza as if violently displaced, and convey strength and resistance&quot;. Several pieces of debris from the original World Trade Center were also placed along the path. The glade opened on May 24, 2019.

===The Sphere===

&quot;The Sphere&quot;, a monumental cast bronze sculpture by German artist Fritz Koenig, was commissioned for the old World Trade Center and completed in 1971. It stood on the Austin J. Tobin Plaza until the September 11 attacks. The sculpture was damaged but survived the attacks and was relocated to Liberty Park, adjacent to the Memorial, in 2017.

=== Controversies surrounding the Memorial ===

====Mohammad Salman Hamdani====
Although victims&#x27;-family groups agreed that names would be grouped by workplace or other affiliation, NYPD cadet Mohammad Salman Hamdani was not included with the other first responders or the other victims whose remains were found in the wreckage of the North Tower. His name appears on the memorial&#x27;s panel S-66 for World Trade Center victims (next to a blank space along the South Tower perimeter), with those who did not fit into the groups created by the memorial committee or who had a loose connection to the World Trade Center. Hamdani&#x27;s mother, Talat, has campaigned for the Memorial to acknowledge her son as a police cadet and first responder. Hamdani received a full police-department funeral after his body was found (months after the attacks), and 204th Street in Bayside, Queens, the street on which he lived was renamed in his honor.

====Arabic-language brochures====
Although the memorial&#x27;s brochures were initially translated into at least ten languages, these languages did not include Arabic. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) questioned this decision in letters to memorial directors, and ADC director of communications and advocacy Raed Jarrar said: &quot;Our fear is that there is a political intention behind the exclusion&quot;. A memorial representative told the &quot;New York Post&quot;, &quot;As Arabic-speaking visitors currently represent our 25th-largest group, Arabic translations are not yet among the initial foreign-language editions.&quot;

In 2015, the ADC made an official complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which had given hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to the September 11 Memorial through block grants to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. The committee stated that the Memorial&#x27;s decision to not publish Arabic-language brochures violated HUD&#x27;s Limited English Proficiency rules for grantees. In December 2017, the ADC announced that the Memorial had signed a settlement agreement whereby its commemorative guide would be translated into Arabic and made available.

==Museum==

The September 11 Museum was dedicated on May 15, 2014, and opened to the public on May 21. Its collection includes more than 40,000 images, 14,000 artifacts, more than 3,500 oral recordings, and over 500 hours of video.

===History===
The underground museum has artifacts from September 11, 2001, including steel from the Twin Towers (such as the Last Column, the last piece of steel to leave Ground Zero in May 2002). In December 2011, museum construction halted temporarily due to disputes between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum Foundation over responsibility for infrastructure costs. On March 13, 2012, talks on the issue began, and construction resumed on September 10, 2012. After a number of false opening reports, it was announced that the museum would open to the public on May 21, 2014.


The museum was dedicated on May 15, 2014. In attendance were a range of dignitaries, from President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to former mayors David Dinkins, Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg and then-mayor Bill de Blasio. During the hour-long ceremony LaChanze sang &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, which she dedicated to her husband Calvin Gooding, who was killed in the World Trade Center attack. During the five days between its dedication and the public opening, over 42,000 first responders and family members of 9/11 victims visited the museum.

An opening ceremony for the museum was held on May 21, during which 24 police officers and firefighters unfurled the restored national 9/11 flag before it was brought into the museum for permanent display. The gates surrounding the museum were then taken down, marking their first removal since the attacks. Opening day tickets quickly sold out. Despite the museum&#x27;s design to evoke memories without additional distress, counselors were available during its opening due to the large number of visitors.

===Design===
Designed by Davis Brody Bond, the museum is about below ground and accessible through a pavilion designed by Snøhetta. The National September 11 Memorial Museum encloses of publicly accessible space. The pavilion has a deconstructivist design, resembling a partially collapsed building (mirroring the attacks), and houses two &quot;tridents&quot; from the Twin Towers. One of the museum&#x27;s walls is an exposed side of the slurry wall retaining the Hudson River, which remained intact through the September 11 attacks. About half of what Daniel Libeskind originally wanted to preserve of the wall is visible in the museum.

Other Ground Zero artifacts include wrecked emergency vehicles (including a fire engine deformed from the collapse), pieces of metal from all seven World Trade Center buildings, recordings of survivors and first responders (including 911 calls, pictures of all victims, photographs from the wreckage, and other media detailing the destruction [including the crashes, collapse, fires, those who jumped, and the cleanup]). The Waterford Crystal &quot;Hope for Healing&quot; panels from the Times Square Ball for New Year&#x27;s Eve 2002—which were inscribed with the names of emergency organizations and countries that had taken casualties in the attacks—were also donated to the museum&#x27;s collection.

The museum is designed to evoke memories without additional distress, particularly to first responders and the victims&#x27; families.

&quot;The Huffington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;walking through the museum is like being transported back to the turmoil, destruction and anguish of 9/11. Exhibits express the disbelief and heartache of New York and the nation.&quot;

===Controversies surrounding the Museum===
====Little Syria====
A neighborhood that was once called Little Syria, a center of Christian Arab immigrant life in the United States beginning in the 1880s, once existed just south of the site of the World Trade Center. The cornerstone of St. Joseph&#x27;s Lebanese Maronite Church was found under the rubble, next to St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church at 157 Cedar Street. Both congregations were founded by Christians who had fled Ottoman oppression in the Middle East. Activists lobbied for the Museum to include a permanent exhibit about the neighborhood to &quot;help the thousands of tourists who visit the site to understand that immigrants from Ottoman lands have played a patriotic role in the country&#x27;s history,&quot; arguing that it was important to memorialize the multiethnic character of &quot;Little Syria.&quot; The old Christian Syrian neighborhood was demolished in the 1940s due to the construction of the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel.

====Museum operation====

General admission tickets to the museum are $33, a price that has raised concerns. Michael Bloomberg agreed, encouraging people to &quot;write your congressman&quot; for more federal funding.

When the museum opened to victim families and first responders on May 15, 2014, anger by some that it was profiting from souvenirs considered in poor taste was widely covered. Souvenir proceeds would fund the museum and memorial. On May 29, 2014, a U.S.-shaped cheese platter was among items removed for sale, and it was announced that all items sold would be reviewed by victim families for suitability.

Families were further angered after a May 20, 2014 black-tie, VIP cocktail party for donors at the museum. Among the 60 attendees were former mayor Michael Bloomberg and representatives of Condé Nast. Family members objected to a party near unidentified remains; the sister of victim Robert Shay, Jr. tweeted, &quot;Did you enjoy having drinks on top of my brother&#x27;s grave last night?&quot; Shay and dozens of other visitors were angered that first responders were turned away from the museum the previous day while staff prepared for the party. She said, &quot;I am outraged that I can&#x27;t visit my brother&#x27;s final resting place without an appointment but people like Mike Bloomberg can wine and dine there whenever they want. This memorial and museum is sacred ground and last night it was desecrated.&quot; A retired FDNY fire marshal said, &quot;You don&#x27;t have cocktail parties at a cemetery.&quot; A mid-2014 proposal to open a Danny Meyer cafe in the museum&#x27;s atrium was criticized.

====Placement of unidentified remains====
In an early-morning ceremony on May 10, 2014, the long-unidentified remains of 1,115 victims were transferred from the city medical examiner to Ground Zero, where they would be placed in a space in the bedrock below ground as part of the 9/11 Memorial Museum. Reaction from the victims&#x27; families to the move was divided, with some supporting the decision and others calling the location inappropriate. Among the latter was FDNY Lt. James McCaffrey, the brother-in-law of 9/11 victim and firefighter Orio Palmer, who called a ground-level tomb a more dignified location: &quot;The decision to put the human remains of the 9/11 dead in this basement is inherently disrespectful and totally offensive.&quot; McCaffrey said that the remains deserved a prominence equal to that of the Memorial&#x27;s trees and pools, and that the ceremony was held early in the morning because of opposition to the decision.

==Withdrawn proposals==
Two centers were proposed and withdrawn from the World Trade Center Memorial plan in 2005:
* The International Freedom Center – a think tank intended to draw attention to battles for freedom throughout history. World Trade Center Memorial Foundation member Deborah Burlingame wrote in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that the center would have a mission with no direct connection to the events of September 11 and might criticize American policy. Right-wing blogs and commentators heavily criticized the center until Governor George Pataki withdrew support for it.
* The Drawing Center Art Gallery at the World Trade Center – an art gallery that was in SoHo at the time.
Plans called for the Freedom Center to share space with the Drawing Center in a building known as the Cultural Center. Of the dispute over the proposed centers, one &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial argued that the IFC&#x27;s opponents made trivial and unconvincing suggestions that both the IFC and the &quot;cultural component&quot; of architect Daniel Libeskind&#x27;s plans would somehow diminish the scope of the Memorial Museum, and noted that the proposal for reducing the size of one of the centers had failed to consider the emotional impact of the space.

== Other 9/11 memorials ==

In addition to the one at Ground Zero, a number of other memorials have been built by communities across the United States. Many are built around remnants of steel from the Twin Towers that have been donated by a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey program; over 1,000 pieces of World Trade Center steel have been distributed.
