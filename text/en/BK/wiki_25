<text>In mathematics, particularly algebraic topology and homology theory, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is an algebraic tool to help compute algebraic invariants of topological spaces. The result is due to two Austrian mathematicians, Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris. The method consists of splitting a space into subspaces, for which the homology or cohomology groups may be easier to compute. The sequence relates the (co)homology groups of the space to the (co)homology groups of the subspaces. It is a natural long exact sequence, whose entries are the (co)homology groups of the whole space, the direct sum of the (co)homology groups of the subspaces, and the (co)homology groups of the intersection of the subspaces.

The Mayer–Vietoris sequence holds for a variety of cohomology and homology theories, including simplicial homology and singular cohomology. In general, the sequence holds for those theories satisfying the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms, and it has variations for both reduced and relative (co)homology. Because the (co)homology of most spaces cannot be computed directly from their definitions, one uses tools such as the Mayer–Vietoris sequence in the hope of obtaining partial information. Many spaces encountered in topology are constructed by piecing together very simple patches. Carefully choosing the two covering subspaces so that, together with their intersection, they have simpler (co)homology than that of the whole space may allow a complete deduction of the (co)homology of the space. In that respect, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is analogous to the Seifert–van Kampen theorem for the fundamental group, and a precise relation exists for homology of dimension one.

==Background, motivation, and history==

Similarly to the fundamental group or the higher homotopy groups of a space, homology groups are important topological invariants. Although some (co)homology theories are computable using tools of linear algebra, many other important (co)homology theories, especially singular (co)homology, are not computable directly from their definition for nontrivial spaces. For singular (co)homology, the singular (co)chains and (co)cycles groups are often too big to handle directly. More subtle and indirect approaches become necessary. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is such an approach, giving partial information about the (co)homology groups of any space by relating it to the (co)homology groups of two of its subspaces and their intersection.

The most natural and convenient way to express the relation involves the algebraic concept of exact sequences: sequences of objects (in this case groups) and morphisms (in this case group homomorphisms) between them such that the image of one morphism equals the kernel of the next. In general, this does not allow (co)homology groups of a space to be completely computed. However, because many important spaces encountered in topology are topological manifolds, simplicial complexes, or CW complexes, which are constructed by piecing together very simple patches, a theorem such as that of Mayer and Vietoris is potentially of broad and deep applicability.

Mayer was introduced to topology by his colleague Vietoris when attending his lectures in 1926 and 1927 at a local university in Vienna. He was told about the conjectured result and a way to its solution, and solved the question for the Betti numbers in 1929. He applied his results to the torus considered as the union of two cylinders. Vietoris later proved the full result for the homology groups in 1930 but did not express it as an exact sequence. The concept of an exact sequence only appeared in print in the 1952 book &quot;Foundations of Algebraic Topology&quot; by Samuel Eilenberg and Norman Steenrod, where the results of Mayer and Vietoris were expressed in the modern form.

==Basic versions for singular homology==
Let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space and &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; be two subspaces whose interiors cover &quot;X&quot;. (The interiors of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; need not be disjoint.) The Mayer–Vietoris sequence in singular homology for the triad (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) is a long exact sequence relating the singular homology groups (with coefficient group the integers Z) of the spaces &quot;X&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and the intersection &quot;A&quot;∩&quot;B&quot;. There is an unreduced and a reduced version.

===Unreduced version===
For unreduced homology, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence states that the following sequence is exact:

:formula_1
:formula_2

Here formula_3 , and formula_4 are inclusion maps and formula_5 denotes the direct sum of abelian groups.

===Boundary map===
The boundary maps ∂∗ lowering the dimension may be defined as follows. An element in &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is the homology class of an &quot;n&quot;-cycle &quot;x&quot; which, by barycentric subdivision for example, can be written as the sum of two &quot;n&quot;-chains &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; whose images lie wholly in &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, respectively. Thus ∂&quot;x&quot; = ∂(&quot;u&quot; + &quot;v&quot;) = ∂&quot;u&quot; + ∂&quot;v&quot;. Since &quot;x&quot; is a cycle, ∂x = 0, so ∂&quot;u&quot; = −∂&quot;v&quot;. This implies that the images of both these boundary (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-cycles are contained in the intersection &quot;A&quot;∩&quot;B&quot;. Then ∂∗([&quot;x&quot;]) can be defined to be the class of ∂&quot;u&quot; in &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1(&quot;A&quot;∩&quot;B&quot;). Choosing another decomposition &quot;x&quot; = &quot;u′&quot; + &quot;v′&quot; does not affect [∂&quot;u&quot;], since ∂&quot;u&quot; + ∂&quot;v&quot; = ∂&quot;x&quot; = ∂&quot;u′&quot; + ∂&quot;v′&quot;, which implies ∂&quot;u&quot; − ∂&quot;u′&quot; = ∂(&quot;v′&quot; − &quot;v&quot;), and therefore ∂&quot;u&quot; and ∂&quot;u′&quot; lie in the same homology class; nor does choosing a different representative &quot;x′&quot;, since then &quot;x′&quot; - &quot;x&quot; = ∂&quot;φ&quot; for some &quot;φ&quot; in &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1(&quot;X&quot;). Notice that the maps in the Mayer–Vietoris sequence depend on choosing an order for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. In particular, the boundary map changes sign if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are swapped.

===Reduced version===
For reduced homology there is also a Mayer–Vietoris sequence, under the assumption that &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; have non-empty intersection. The sequence is identical for positive dimensions and ends as:

:formula_6

===Analogy with the Seifert–van Kampen theorem===
There is an analogy between the Mayer–Vietoris sequence (especially for homology groups of dimension 1) and the Seifert–van Kampen theorem. Whenever formula_7 is path-connected, the reduced Mayer–Vietoris sequence yields the isomorphism

:formula_8

where, by exactness,

:formula_9

This is precisely the abelianized statement of the Seifert–van Kampen theorem. Compare with the fact that formula_10 is the abelianization of the fundamental group formula_11 when formula_12 is path-connected.

==Basic applications==

===&quot;k&quot;-sphere===

To completely compute the homology of the &quot;k&quot;-sphere &quot;X&quot; = &quot;S&quot;&quot;k&quot;, let &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; be two hemispheres of &quot;X&quot; with intersection homotopy equivalent to a (&quot;k&quot; − 1)-dimensional equatorial sphere. Since the &quot;k&quot;-dimensional hemispheres are homeomorphic to &quot;k&quot;-discs, which are contractible, the homology groups for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are trivial. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence for reduced homology groups then yields

:formula_13

Exactness immediately implies that the map ∂* is an isomorphism. Using the reduced homology of the 0-sphere (two points) as a base case, it follows

:formula_14

where δ is the Kronecker delta. Such a complete understanding of the homology groups for spheres is in stark contrast with current knowledge of homotopy groups of spheres, especially for the case &quot;n&quot; &gt; &quot;k&quot; about which little is known.

===Klein bottle===

A slightly more difficult application of the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is the calculation of the homology groups of the Klein bottle &quot;X&quot;. One uses the decomposition of &quot;X&quot; as the union of two Möbius strips &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; glued along their boundary circle (see illustration on the right). Then &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and their intersection &quot;A&quot;∩&quot;B&quot; are homotopy equivalent to circles, so the nontrivial part of the sequence yields

:formula_15

and the trivial part implies vanishing homology for dimensions greater than 2. The central map α sends 1 to (2, −2) since the boundary circle of a Möbius band wraps twice around the core circle. In particular α is injective so homology of dimension 2 also vanishes. Finally, choosing (1, 0) and (1, −1) as a basis for Z2, it follows

:formula_16

===Wedge sums===

Let &quot;X&quot; be the wedge sum of two spaces &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot;, and suppose furthermore that the identified basepoint is a deformation retract of open neighborhoods &quot;U&quot; ⊆ &quot;K&quot; and &quot;V&quot; ⊆ &quot;L&quot;. Letting &quot;A&quot; = &quot;K&quot; ∪ &quot;V&quot; and &quot;B&quot; = &quot;U&quot; ∪ &quot;L&quot; it follows that &quot;A&quot; ∪ &quot;B&quot; = &quot;X&quot; and &quot;A&quot; ∩ &quot;B&quot; = &quot;U&quot; ∪ &quot;V&quot;, which is contractible by construction. The reduced version of the sequence then yields (by exactness)
:formula_17
for all dimensions &quot;n&quot;. The illustration on the right shows &quot;X&quot; as the sum of two 2-spheres &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot;. For this specific case, using the result from above for 2-spheres, one has
:formula_18

===Suspensions===

If &quot;X&quot; is the suspension &quot;SY&quot; of a space &quot;Y&quot;, let &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; be the complements in &quot;X&quot; of the top and bottom &#x27;vertices&#x27; of the double cone, respectively. Then &quot;X&quot; is the union &quot;A&quot;∪&quot;B&quot;, with &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; contractible. Also, the intersection &quot;A&quot;∩&quot;B&quot; is homotopy equivalent to &quot;Y&quot;. Hence the Mayer–Vietoris sequence yields, for all &quot;n&quot;,
:formula_19

The illustration on the right shows the 1-sphere &quot;X&quot; as the suspension of the 0-sphere &quot;Y&quot;. Noting in general that the &quot;k&quot;-sphere is the suspension of the (&quot;k&quot; − 1)-sphere, it is easy to derive the homology groups of the &quot;k&quot;-sphere by induction, as above.

==Further discussion==

===Relative form===
A relative form of the Mayer–Vietoris sequence also exists. If &quot;Y&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot; and is the union of the interiors of &quot;C&quot; ⊂ &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; ⊂ &quot;B&quot;, then the exact sequence is:

:formula_20

===Naturality===
The homology groups are natural in the sense that if formula_21 is a continuous map, then there is a canonical pushforward map of homology groups formula_22 such that the composition of pushforwards is the pushforward of a composition: that is, formula_23 The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is also natural in the sense that if

:formula_24,

then the connecting morphism of the Mayer–Vietoris sequence, formula_25 commutes with formula_26. That is, the following diagram commutes (the horizontal maps are the usual ones):

:formula_27

===Cohomological versions===

The Mayer–Vietoris long exact sequence for singular cohomology groups with coefficient group &quot;G&quot; is dual to the homological version. It is the following:

:formula_28

where the dimension preserving maps are restriction maps induced from inclusions, and the (co-)boundary maps are defined in a similar fashion to the homological version. There is also a relative formulation.

As an important special case when &quot;G&quot; is the group of real numbers R and the underlying topological space has the additional structure of a smooth manifold, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence for de Rham cohomology is

:formula_29

where is an open cover of denotes the restriction map, and is the difference. The map formula_30 is defined similarly as the map formula_31 from above. It can be briefly described as follows. For a cohomology class represented by closed form in , express as a difference of forms formula_32 via a partition of unity subordinate to the open cover , for example. The exterior derivative and agree on and therefore together define an form on . One then has .

For de Rham cohomology with compact supports, there exists a &quot;flipped&quot; version of the above sequence:

:formula_33

where formula_34,formula_35,formula_12 are as above, formula_37 is the signed inclusion map formula_38 where formula_39 extends a form with compact support to a form on formula_34 by zero, and formula_41 is the sum.

===Derivation===
Consider the long exact sequence associated to the short exact sequences of chain groups (constituent groups of chain complexes)

:formula_42,

where α(&quot;x&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot;, −&quot;x&quot;), β(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot;) is the chain group consisting of sums of chains in &quot;A&quot; and chains in &quot;B&quot;. It is a fact that the singular &quot;n&quot;-simplices of &quot;X&quot; whose images are contained in either &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; generate all of the homology group &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). In other words, &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot;) is isomorphic to &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). This gives the Mayer–Vietoris sequence for singular homology.

The same computation applied to the short exact sequences of vector spaces of differential forms

:formula_43

yields the Mayer–Vietoris sequence for de Rham cohomology.

From a formal point of view, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence can be derived from the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms for homology theories using the long exact sequence in homology.

===Other homology theories===
The derivation of the Mayer–Vietoris sequence from the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms does not require the dimension axiom, so in addition to existing in ordinary cohomology theories, it holds in extraordinary cohomology theories (such as topological K-theory and cobordism).

===Sheaf cohomology===
From the point of view of sheaf cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is related to Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the degeneration of the spectral sequence that relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris spectral sequence) in the case where the open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.

<doc id="378680" wikidata="Q1071444" url="?curid=378680" title="Jim Anderton's Progressive Party">
<text>Jim Anderton&#x27;s Progressive Party (formed on 27 July 2002 as the Progressive Party and renamed after its founder in 2005) was a New Zealand political party to the political left of its ally, the Labour Party.

The party was established when Jim Anderton and his supporters left the Alliance party. The Progressive Party held at least one seat in Parliament from 2002 to 2011 because of Anderton&#x27;s victories in the electorate of Wigram. The party did not contest the 2011 general election, and was de-registered at its own request on 9 March 2012 .

==Policies==
Economically, the party was left of centre, and placed particular attention on economic development.
It had a particular focus on the creation of jobs, and said it was committed to achieving full employment. Among its other policy objectives were free education and free healthcare, four weeks of annual leave from work, an &quot;anti-drugs&quot; policy, and cutting the corporate tax rate to 30%. It also advocated an abolition of the Goods and Services Tax in favour of a broad-based financial transactions tax, and monetary policy reform. Its campaign slogan was &quot;Get things done&quot;.

==History==
The Progressive Party was established by a faction of the Alliance, a left-wing party that does not presently hold seats in Parliament but was once the third-largest party there. Having won ten seats in the 1999 election, the Alliance went into coalition with Labour, forming a government with Anderton as deputy prime minister.

Towards the end of the parliamentary term, tensions between different factions of the party increased. In particular, the party&#x27;s parliamentary leader, Anderton, and the party&#x27;s organisational leader and president, Matt McCarten, became involved in a significant dispute. The causes of the problems are debated by the various actors, but a significant factor appears to be a claim by McCarten&#x27;s faction that the Alliance was giving too much away to the Labour Party. In addition, McCarten&#x27;s faction claimed that Anderton&#x27;s leadership style was &quot;autocratic&quot;, and that the parliamentary wing was failing to heed the concerns of the party&#x27;s membership. Anderton rejected the latter charge, and he claimed that criticism of the Alliance&#x27;s ties to Labour were &quot;extremist&quot; and would nullify the party&#x27;s ability to influence government policy. The conflict gradually became more and more severe until Anderton eventually demanded the resignation of the party&#x27;s governing council.

The party organisation expelled Anderton and his supporters, with Anderton announcing his intentions of establishing a new party. However, because of an electoral law, Anderton did not officially leave the Alliance&#x27;s parliamentary wing, even if he had left the party itself – doing so would have required his resignation from parliament, a step he was unwilling to take. Anderton had supported this law as a result of the great instability caused by rampant party-switching in the previous Parliament. As such, Anderton and his supporters remained technically a part of the Alliance&#x27;s parliamentary wing until the election, when they officially established their new party.

The Democrats, a component of the Alliance, broke away to join the new group which was to be the &quot;Progressive Coalition&quot;, but shortly before the 2002 election, the official name was changed to &quot;Jim Anderton&#x27;s Progressive Coalition&quot;, a measure Anderton says was intended to ensure that the new party was recognised. Later, after the Democrats had departed to re-establish themselves as an independent entity, the name &quot;Progressive Party&quot; was adopted.

The new party placed Anderton&#x27;s supporters from the Alliance first on its party list. In the elections, it competed against both the Alliance (then led by Laila Harré, a supporter of McCarten) and Labour. It managed to gain 1.7% of the vote, and Jim Anderton was successful in retaining his electorate seat in . As such, the party gained entry to parliament with two seats, including deputy leader Matt Robson, who had been a member of Anderton&#x27;s faction of the Alliance. The Alliance itself failed to win any seats. It received only 1.27% of the vote, and Laila Harré lost to Lynne Pillay in the electorate, meaning the Alliance won no electorate seats.

The Progressives took up the Alliance&#x27;s old position as Labour&#x27;s junior coalition partner. However, as the Progressives brought fewer seats to the coalition than the Alliance had, the new party&#x27;s influence was not as great. Anderton retained his position as Minister of Economic Development but lost the role of deputy prime minister to Labour&#x27;s Michael Cullen, the Minister of Finance and deputy leader of Labour. Robson, who had been Minister of Corrections, Minister for Courts, Minister for Land Information, and Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs in the previous government, lost his cabinet posts.

Shortly before the 2005 election, the official name of the party was changed again, this time to &quot;Jim Anderton&#x27;s Progressive&quot;, to facilitate voter recognition on ballot papers. In those elections, the Progressives&#x27; vote tailed off slightly to 1.2 percent, but this decline was enough to keep Robson from returning to Parliament even though Anderton easily won his seat. The indication of the New Zealand First and United Future parties that they would support either National or Labour based on whichever received the most votes may have eroded the Progressives&#x27; potential share of the vote alongside other minor parties. As Labour was returned to power, however, Anderton was able to retain his place in government.

In the 2008 election the Progressive Party gained 0.91% of the vote. Anderton retained his electorate seat and remained in Parliament representing the party. In an unusual move, Anderton announced that he would remain in coalition with Labour in opposition.

Jim Anderton announced his retirement from Parliament from the 2011 general election. The party did not contest the election and is now no longer in Parliament. On 9 March 2012 the party was de-registered at its own request.

<text>Sylvano Bussotti (1 October 1931 – 19 September 2021) was an Italian composer of contemporary classical music, also a painter, set and costume designer, opera director and manager, writer and academic teacher. His compositions employ graphic notation, which has often created special problems of interpretation. He was known as a composer for the stage. His first opera was &quot;La Passion selon Sade&quot;, premiered in Palermo in 1965. Later operas and ballets were premiered at the Teatro Comunale di Firenze, Teatro Lirico di Milano, Teatro Regio di Torino and Piccola Scala di Milano, among others. He was artistic director of La Fenice in Venice, the Puccini Festival and the music section of the Venice Biennale. He taught internationally, for a decade at the Fiesole School of Music. He is regarded as a leading composer of Italy&#x27;s avantgarde, and a Renaissance man with many talents who combined the arts expressively.

==Life and career==
Born in Florence, Bussotti learned to play the violin beginning before the age of five with Margherita Castellani, becoming a prodigy. He was also introduced to painting, by his uncle and his older brother Renzo. At the Florence Conservatory, he studied harmony and counterpoint with Roberto Lupi, and piano with Luigi Dallapiccola, but achieved no diploma due to World War II. He kept studying composition on his own. From 1956, he studied privately in Paris with Max Deutsch, and met Luigi Nono, Pierre Boulez and Heinz-Klaus Metzger who introduced him to the Darmstädter Ferienkurse. His first composition performed in public was &quot;Breve&quot;, played by Françoise Deslogères at a gallery in Düsseldorf in 1958, with John Cage in the audience. In Paris, Cathy Berberian sang his works, conducted by Boulez. Bussotti travelled to the U.S. in 1964 and 1965, visiting Buffalo and New York invited by the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1972, he visited Berlin, invited by German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) for the Ford Foundation.

As a composer he was influenced by the twelve-tone music of Webern and later John Cage. Examples of his use of graphic notation in his pieces, often reflecting his personal life, included &quot;La Passion selon Sade&quot; and &quot;Lorenzaccio&quot;. He was a composer of the Florentine artistic current, that has been active since the end of World War II up to the present, including Giuseppe Chiari, Giancarlo Cardini, Albert Mayr, Marcello Aitiani, Sergio Maltagliati, Daniele Lombardi, and Pietro Grossi. These musicians experimented with the interaction between sound, sign, and vision, a synaesthetics of art derived from historical avant-gardes, from Kandinsky to futurism, to Scriabin and Schoenberg, all the way to Bauhaus.
Bussotti also pursued other disciplines including painting, graphic art, and journalism. He was a well-known film director, actor, and singer. He wrote most of the librettos for his operas. As a writer, his style was considered one of the most refined among the Italian poets and novelists of the 20th century. French culture fascinated him since he was a boy. His great friend Cathy Berberian (Luciano Berio&#x27;s wife) was one of his most famous interpreters. He was well acquainted with writers and film directors Aldo Palazzeschi, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Derek Jarman, Elsa Morante, Alberto Moravia, Aldo Braibanti, Mario Zanzotto, Fabio Casadei Turroni, Dacia Maraini, and Umberto Eco. Jarman was the director of his opera &quot;L&#x27;Ispirazione&quot;, first staged in Florence in 1988. &quot;Rara Film&quot; is his most celebrated underground film. The silent film, according to the author&#x27;s instructions, should be performed, together with the score, played by seven to eleven players. The music of &quot;Rara Film&quot; is not a strict counterpoint of the film, flowing without any relation to the images.

Bussotti was the stage director of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;The Fair at Sorochyntsi&quot; for La Scala in Milan in 1981, followed two years later by Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Il trittico&quot;, a televised production for which he designed the set of &quot;Gianni Schicchi&quot;. He served as the artistic director of La Fenice in Venice, directed the Puccini Festival in Torre del Lago, and was director of opera at La Scala. He was head of the music section of the Venice Biennale from 1987. He taught composition, analysis and the history of musical theatre at the Academy of Fine Arts in L&#x27;Aquila, at the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart in Stuttgart, at the Royan Festival and from 1980 to 1991 at the Fiesole School of Music. As a personality, he was notoriously flamboyant and occasionally shocking. Openly gay, Bussotti expressed his sexuality in his music as early as 1958, when it was socially dangerous to do so. His partner and spouse was Rocco Quaglia, a ballet dancer and choreographer with whom he collaborated in many projects.

Bussotti died at a nursing home in Milan after a long illness on 19 September 2021, twelve days before his 90th birthday. Festivities planned in Florence for the event are held in his memory, titled &quot;90 Bussotti&quot;, from 20 to 25 September, including performances by , Florence Queer Festival, Fondazione Culturale Stensen, Maschietto Editore, and Tempo Reale, collaborating with Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Bussotti Opera Ballet and the Museo Marino Marini. In Germany, from September 29 to October 1, a scientific conference was held on Bussotti&#x27;s work, in the course of which the Ensemble E-MEX played two commemorative concerts. This included the first complete performance of Bussotti&#x27;s &quot;Piêces de Chair II&quot; (1960), sung, among others, by soprano Monica Benvenuti, who had long been closely associated with the composer.

==Awards==
Bussotti was awarded the ISCM Prize from the International Society for Contemporary Music in 1961, 1963 and 1965, then in 1967 the All&#x27;Amelia Prize at the Venice Biennale, in 1974 the Toscani d&#x27;Oggi Prize, and in 1979 the Psacaropulo Prize.

<text>BeauSoleil (French, &quot;beautiful sun&quot;) is a Cajun band from Louisiana, United States.

==Band history==
Founded in 1975, BeauSoleil (often billed as &quot;BeauSoleil avec Michael Doucet&quot;) released its first album in 1977 and became one of the most well-known bands performing traditional and original music rooted in the folk tunes of the Cajuns and Creoles of Louisiana. In early years they appeared at CODOFIL&#x27;s annual &quot;Tribute to Cajun Music&quot; in Lafayette, Louisiana. They were part of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in 1983.

BeauSoleil tours extensively in the U.S. and internationally. While its repertoire includes hundreds of traditional Cajun, Creole and zydeco songs, BeauSoleil has also pushed past constraints of purely traditional instrumentation, rhythm, and lyrics of Louisiana folk music, incorporating elements of rock and roll, jazz, blues, calypso, and other genres in original compositions and reworkings of traditional tunes. Lyrics on BeauSoleil recordings are sung in English or Cajun French (and sometimes both in one song).

According to the band&#x27;s website, BeauSoleil&#x27;s musicians &quot;take the rich Cajun traditions of Louisiana and artfully blend elements of zydeco, New Orleans jazz, Tex-Mex, country, blues and more into a satisfying musical recipe.&quot; The band&#x27;s name is a tribute to Joseph Broussard dit Beausoleil, an Acadian resistance leader who led many Acadians to Louisiana following their expulsion by the British.
BeauSoleil has appeared on soundtracks to films &quot;The Big Easy&quot;, &quot;Passion Fish&quot; and &quot;Belizaire the Cajun&quot;. The group plays at jazz and folk festivals and has appeared on numerous television shows, including CNN&#x27;s &quot;Showbiz Today&quot;, &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, and &quot;Emeril Live&quot;. BeauSoleil appeared regularly on Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;Prairie Home Companion&quot; radio show. Keillor has hailed the group as the &quot;best Cajun band in the world&quot;. BeauSoleil has also performed in concert with Mary Chapin Carpenter and opened for the Grateful Dead. Carpenter featured them on her 1991 single &quot;Down at the Twist and Shout&quot;, in which they are also mentioned by name.

==Recognition==
BeauSoleil is one of a few groups performing traditional Louisiana music to win a Grammy Award. &quot;L&#x27;Amour Ou La Folie (Love Or Folly)&quot;, recorded in 1996 and released on Rhino Records, earned the 1997 Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album. In a review on Amazon.com, Richard Gehr wrote, &quot;By now the sextet transcends the dancehall, possessing the ability to transform nearly any traditional Cajun, Creole, or French tune into high art while preserving a clear sonic bloodline back to its roots.&quot;

In 2005, BeauSoleil&#x27;s &quot;Gitane Cajun&quot;, released on Vanguard Records, earned the group its tenth Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Folk Album. A reflection of its versatility is that BeauSoleil has also earned a Grammy nomination in the Contemporary Folk category, for the 1999 album &quot;Cajunization&quot;, with songs that effortlessly span Cajun, calypso, French ballad, blues and other musical styles.

In 2005, BeauSoleil won the Big Easy Entertainment Award for Best Cajun Band, the tenth time the band was honored in the 18-year history of the awards presented by the New Orleans music and entertainment publication &quot;Gambit Weekly.&quot;

In 2005, BeauSoleil founder Michael Doucet was one of 12 artists awarded a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts.

In 2008, BeauSoleil won another Grammy in the then newly created Grammy Award for Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album category for the album &quot;Live at the 2008 New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival&quot;.

BeauSoleil was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2011.

The BeauSoleil Quartet was interviewed by Stephen Winick of the American Folklife Center to preserve their oral history on June 28, 2017.

<text>The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (, SEHK, also known as Hong Kong Stock Exchange) is a stock exchange based in Hong Kong. It is one of the largest stock exchanges in Asia and the 9th largest globally by market capitalization as of August 2024. The exchange plays a crucial role in connecting international investors with mainland Chinese companies, serving as a major platform for capital raising. Unlike mainland Chinese exchanges, it operates under Hong Kong’s distinct regulatory framework, which allows greater access to foreign investors.

The stock exchange is owned (through its subsidiary Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited) by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), a holding company that it also lists () and that in 2021 became the world&#x27;s largest bourse operator in terms of market capitalization, surpassing Chicago-based CME. A 2021 poll reported that approximately 57% of Hong Kong adults had money invested in the stock market. The physical trading floor at Exchange Square was closed in October 2017.

==History==
The Hong Kong securities market can be traced back to 1866, but the stock market was formally set up in 1891, when the Association of Stockbrokers in Hong Kong was established. It was renamed as The Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1914.

By 1972, Hong Kong had four stock exchanges in operation. There were subsequent calls for the formation of a unified stock exchange. The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited was incorporated in 1980 and trading on the exchange finally commenced on 2 April 1986. Since 1986, a number of major developments have taken place. The 1987 market crash revealed flaws in the market and led to calls for a complete reform of the Hong Kong securities industry. This led to significant regulatory changes and infrastructural developments. As a result, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) was set up in 1989 as the single statutory securities market regulator.

The market infrastructure was much improved with the introduction by the exchange of the Central Clearing and Settlement System (CCASS) in June 1992 and the Automatic Order Matching and Execution System (AMS) in November 1993. Since then, the framework of market rules and regulations, both exchange-administered or otherwise, have been undergoing continuing review and revision to meet changing market needs while ensuring effective market
regulation.

The Exchange Listing Rules have been made more comprehensive, and other existing regulations have been improved or new regulations introduced to enhance market development and investor protection. Enhancements were also made to the system infrastructure, including the launch of off-floor trading terminals in brokers&#x27; offices in January 1996. The third generation of the trading system, AMS/3, was launched in 2000. It provides enhanced functionality and a platform for a straight-through transaction process.

In respect of market and product development, there is the listing of the first derivative warrant in February 1988, the listing of the first China-incorporated enterprise (H share) in June 1993 (Tsingtao Brewery); and the introduction of regulated short selling in January 1994 and stock options in September 1995. Furthermore, the exchange introduced the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) in November 1999 to provide fundraising opportunities for growth companies of all sizes from all industries, and to promote the development of technology industries in the region.

According to the reform plan announced in March 1999, the Exchange, the Hong Kong Futures Exchange and their clearinghouses merged into a new holding company, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.

===Brief chronology===
* On 2 April 1986, a new trading hall opened. At that time, a total of 249 companies were listed on the Exchange, total market capitalisation was HK$245 billion.
* On 6 October 1986, the Stock Exchange had its grand opening.
* In October 1987, the Stock Exchange was closed for four days in an attempt to stop losses during Black Monday global equities market crash.
* In May 1988, the Ian Hay Davison Report, commissioned to investigate practices on the exchange in the lead-up to its closure, is released, resulting in significant market reforms - although many took years to finally implement
* On 24 June 1992, the Central Clearing and Settlement System (CCASS) was introduced
* On 15 July 1993, the Tsingtao Brewery became the first Chinese enterprise to list its H shares on the exchange.
* On 1 November 1993, a new &quot;Automatic Order Matching and Execution System&quot;, AMS/1, was introduced on the exchange; later, in January 1996, the second phase AMS/2 was introduced, becoming the basis of off-floor trading.
* On 12 November 1999, the Tracker Fund of Hong Kong, created by government intervention during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, had its introduction on the exchange.
* On 25 November 1999, two companies were jointly listed on the newly created Growth Enterprise Market (GEM).
* On 6 March 2000, The Stock Exchange, Futures Exchange, and Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company all became wholly owned subsidiaries of HKEx, which was in turn listed on 27 June 2000.
* On 23 October 2000, AMS/3 was implemented on the exchange.
* On 16 January 2006, the Trading Hall was renovated, opened and renamed the Exchange Trading and Exhibition Hall Complex, with the trading area reduced by over half.
* On 31 January 2013, the HKEx Data Centre in Tseung Kwan O was opened and officiated by the then Hong Kong Chief Executive C. Y. Leung.
* On 27 October 2017, the floor trading lobby was closed due to the shift towards electronic trading. By 2014, the venue accounted for less than 1% of trade volume. The Exchange Trading and Exhibition Hall Complex was reopened as the Hong Kong Connect Hall in 20 February 2018 by the then Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and was redeveloped into a conference, ceremonial and exhibition space to showcase Hong Kong&#x27;s financial markets. Listing ceremonies are also hosted at the Hong Kong Connect Hall.
* 19 July 2023: the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD)-Renminbi (RMB) Dual Counter Model was launched with both counters having the same rights, entitlement, status and par value if applicable. Investors are now able to trade their shares on the RMB counter using their offshore RMB. Shares are fully interchangeable between the 2 counters. The model was introduced to provide liquidity to the RMB counter and minimize discrepancies between the 2 counters.

===Exchange history and predecessors===

==Trading hours==

The trading day consists of:
*A pre-opening auction session from 9:00 am to 9:30 am. The opening price of a security is reported shortly after 9:20 am.
*A morning continuous trading session from 09:30 am to 12:00 pm.
*An extended morning session from 12:00 noon to 1:00 pm, also referred to as the lunch break. Continuous trading proceeds in specifically designated securities (currently two ETFs, 4362 and 4363). Trading in other securities is not possible. However, previously placed orders in any securities can be cancelled from 1:00 pm onwards.
*An afternoon continuous trading session from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm.
The closing price is reported as the median of five price snapshots taken from 3:59 to 4:00 pm every 15 seconds. In May 2008, the exchange also implemented a closing auction session to run from 4:00 pm to 4:10 pm, with a similar pricing mechanism as the opening auction; however, this resulted in significant fluctuations in the closing prices of stocks and suspicions of market manipulation. Initially, the exchange proposed limiting price fluctuations in the auction sessions to 2%; in the end, they removed the closing session entirely in March 2009.

Up until 2011, trading hours comprised a pre-opening auction from 9:30 am to 9:50 am, followed by continuous trading from 10:00 am to 12:30 pm and 2:30 pm to 4:00 pm. The two-hour lunch break between the morning and afternoon sessions was the longest among the world&#x27;s 20 major stock exchanges. A 2003 proposal to shorten the lunch break failed due to opposition from brokers. Another plan to shorten the lunch break to one hour was floated by the exchange in 2010; the morning session would then start earlier, run from 9:30 am to 12:00 pm, and the afternoon session from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm, leaving the closing time the same as before. Justifications included bringing hours into line with China. Reactions from both brokers and the restaurant industry were mixed.

On 7 March 2011, the exchange extended its hours in the first of two phases. The morning session now ran from 9:30 am to 12:00 noon, followed by a ninety-minute lunch break, and an afternoon session from 1:30 pm to 4:00 pm. Index futures and options now began trading at 9:15 am, thirty minutes earlier than before, and closed at the same time as before, 4:15 pm. On 5 March 2012, the lunch break was cut to sixty minutes, with the afternoon session running from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm.

==Electronic trading==
The exchange first introduced a computer-assisted trading system on 2 April 1986. In 1993 the exchange launched the &quot;Automatic Order Matching and Execution System&quot; (AMS), which was replaced by the third generation system (AMS/3) in October 2000.

==Regulatory role==
David Webb, independent non-executive director of the Exchange since 2003, has been arguing for a super regulatory authority to assume that role as regulator, as there is an inherent conflict between its commercial and regulatory roles. In the meantime, he argues for improved investor representation on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

In 2007, the uproar by smaller local stockbrokers over the decision by board of directors to cut minimum trading spreads for equities and warrants trading at between 25 HK cents and HK$2 caused the new board to vote to reverse the decision. The reforms were to be implemented in the first quarter, but was put back on the table following protests by brokers. Webb criticised the board for caving in to vested interests.

<doc id="378695" wikidata="Q459290" url="?curid=378695" title="Independent film">
<text>An independent film, independent movie, indie film, or indie movie is a feature film or short film that is produced outside the major film studio system in addition to being produced and distributed by independent entertainment companies (or, in some cases, distributed by major companies). Independent films are sometimes distinguishable by their content and style and how the filmmakers&#x27; artistic vision is realized. Sometimes, independent films are made with considerably lower budgets than major studio films. 

It is not unusual for well-known actors who are cast in independent features to take substantial pay cuts for a variety of reasons: if they truly believe in the message of the film, they feel indebted to a filmmaker for a career break; their career is otherwise stalled, or they feel unable to manage a more significant commitment to a studio film; the film offers an opportunity to showcase a talent that has not gained traction in the studio system; or simply because they want to work with a particular director they admire. Examples of the latter include John Travolta and Bruce Willis taking less than their usual pay to work with Quentin Tarantino on &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.

Generally, the marketing of independent films is characterized by limited release, often at independent movie theaters, but they can also have major marketing campaigns and a wide release. Independent films are often screened at local, national, or international film festivals before distribution (theatrical or retail release). An independent film production can rival a mainstream film production if it has the necessary funding and distribution.

==History==
===Edison Trust===

In 1908, the Motion Picture Patents Company or &quot;Edison Trust&quot; was formed as a trust. The Trust was a cartel that held a monopoly on film production and distribution comprising all the major film companies of the time (Edison, Biograph, Vitagraph, Essanay, Selig, Lubin, Kalem, American Star, American Pathé), the leading distributor (George Kleine) and the biggest supplier of raw film, Eastman Kodak. A number of filmmakers declined or were refused membership to the trust and came to be described as &quot;independent&quot;.

At the time of the formation of the MPPC, Thomas Edison owned most of the major patents relating to motion pictures, including that for raw film. The MPPC vigorously enforced its patents, constantly bringing suits and receiving injunctions against independent filmmakers. Because of this, a number of filmmakers responded by building their own cameras and moving their operations to Hollywood, California, where the distance from Edison&#x27;s home base of New Jersey made it more difficult for the MPPC to enforce its patents.

The Edison Trust was soon ended by two decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States: one in 1912, which canceled the patent on raw film, and a second in 1915, which cancelled all MPPC patents. Though these decisions succeeded at legalizing independent film, they would do little to remedy the &quot;de facto&quot; ban on small productions; the independent filmmakers who had fled to Southern California during the enforcement of the trust had already laid the groundwork for the studio system of classical Hollywood cinema.

===Studio system===
In early 1910, director D.W. Griffith was sent by the Biograph Company to the west coast with his acting troupe, consisting of performers Blanche Sweet, Lillian Gish, Mary Pickford, Lionel Barrymore, and others. They began filming on a vacant lot near Georgia Street in downtown Los Angeles. While there, the company decided to explore new territories, traveling several miles north to Hollywood, a little village that was friendly and positive about the movie company filming there. Griffith then filmed the first movie ever shot in Hollywood, &quot;In Old California&quot;, a Biograph melodrama about California in the 1800s, while it belonged to Mexico. Griffith stayed there for months and made several films before returning to New York.

During the Edison era of the early 1900s, many Jewish immigrants had found jobs in the U.S. film industry. Under the Edison Trust, they were able to make their mark in a brand-new business: the exhibition of films in storefront theaters called nickelodeons. Within a few years, ambitious men like Samuel Goldwyn, Carl Laemmle, Adolph Zukor, Louis B. Mayer, and the Warner Brothers (Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack) had switched to the production side of the business. After hearing about Biograph&#x27;s success in Hollywood, in 1913 many such would-be movie-makers headed west to avoid the fees imposed by Edison. Soon they were the heads of a new kind of enterprise: the movie studio.

By establishing a new system of production, distribution, and exhibition which was independent of The Edison Trust in New York, these studios opened up new horizons for cinema in the United States. The Hollywood oligopoly replaced the Edison monopoly. Within this new system, a pecking order was soon established which left little room for any newcomers. By the mid-1930s, at the top were the five major studios, 20th Century Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, RKO Pictures, and Warner Bros. Then came three smaller companies, Columbia Pictures, United Artists, and Universal Studios. Finally there was &quot;Poverty Row&quot;, a catch-all term used to encompass any other smaller studio that managed to fight their way up into the increasingly exclusive movie business.

While the small studios that made up Poverty Row could be characterized as existing &quot;independently&quot; of any major studio, they utilized the same kind of vertically and horizontally integrated systems of business as the larger players in the game. Though the eventual breakup of the studio system and its restrictive chain-theater distribution network would leave independent movie houses eager for the kind of populist, seat-filling product of the Poverty Row studios, that same paradigm shift would also lead to the decline and ultimate disappearance of &quot;Poverty Row&quot; as a Hollywood phenomenon. While the kinds of films produced by Poverty Row studios only grew in popularity, they would eventually become increasingly available both from major production companies and from independent producers who no longer needed to rely on a studio&#x27;s ability to package and release their work.

This table lists the companies active in late 1935 illustrates the categories commonly used to characterize the Hollywood system.
===Lincoln Motion Picture Company, United Artists and resistance to the studio system===
The studio system quickly became so powerful that some filmmakers once again sought independence. On May 24, 1916, the Lincoln Motion Picture Company was formed, the first movie studio owned and controlled by independent filmmakers.
In 1919, four of the leading figures in American silent cinema (Mary Pickford, Charles Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, and D. W. Griffith) formed United Artists. Each held a 20% stake, with the remaining 20% held by lawyer William Gibbs McAdoo. The idea for the venture originated with Fairbanks, Chaplin, Pickford, and cowboy star William S. Hart a year earlier as they were traveling around the U.S. selling Liberty bonds to help the World War I effort. Already veterans of Hollywood, the four film stars began to talk of forming their own company to better control their own work as well as their futures. They were spurred on by the actions of established Hollywood producers and distributors, who were making moves to tighten their control over their stars&#x27; salaries and creative license. With the addition of Griffith, planning began, but Hart bowed out before things had formalized. When he heard about their scheme, Richard A. Rowland, head of Metro Pictures, is said to have observed, &quot;The inmates are taking over the asylum.&quot;

The four partners, with advice from McAdoo (son-in-law and former Treasury Secretary of then-President Woodrow Wilson), formed their distribution company, with Hiram Abrams as its first managing director. The original terms called for Pickford, Fairbanks, Griffith, and Chaplin to independently produce five pictures each year, but by the time the company got underway in 1920–1921, feature films were becoming more expensive and more polished, and running times had settled at around ninety minutes (or eight reels). It was believed that no one, no matter how popular, could produce and star in five quality feature films a year. By 1924, Griffith had dropped out and the company was facing a crisis: either bring in others to help support a costly distribution system or concede defeat. The veteran producer Joseph Schenck was hired as president. Not only had he been producing pictures for a decade, but he brought along commitments for films starring his wife, Norma Talmadge, his sister-in-law, Constance Talmadge, and his brother-in-law, Buster Keaton. Contracts were signed with a number of independent producers, especially Samuel Goldwyn, Howard Hughes and later Alexander Korda. Schenck also formed a separate partnership with Pickford and Chaplin to buy and build theaters under the United Artists name.

Still, even with a broadening of the company, UA struggled. The coming of sound ended the careers of Pickford and Fairbanks. Chaplin, rich enough to do what he pleased, worked only occasionally. Schenck resigned in 1933 to organize a new company with Darryl F. Zanuck, Twentieth Century Pictures, which soon provided four pictures a year to UA&#x27;s schedule. He was replaced as president by sales manager Al Lichtman who himself resigned after only a few months. Pickford produced a few films, and at various times Goldwyn, Korda, Walt Disney, Walter Wanger, and David O. Selznick were made &quot;producing partners&quot; (i.e., sharing in the profits), but ownership still rested with the founders. As the years passed and the dynamics of the business changed, these &quot;producing partners&quot; drifted away. Goldwyn and Disney left for RKO, Wanger for Universal Pictures, Selznick and Korda for retirement. By the late 1940s, United Artists had virtually ceased to exist as either a producer or distributor.

===Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers===

In 1941, Mary Pickford, Charles Chaplin, Walt Disney, Orson Welles, Samuel Goldwyn, David O. Selznick, Alexander Korda, and Walter Wanger—many of the same people who were members of United Artists—founded the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers. Later members included William Cagney, Sol Lesser, and Hal Roach. The Society aimed to preserve the rights of independent producers in an industry overwhelmingly controlled by the studio system. SIMPP fought to end monopolistic practices by the five major Hollywood studios which controlled the production, distribution, and exhibition of films. In 1942, the SIMPP filed an antitrust suit against Paramount&#x27;s United Detroit Theatres. The complaint accused Paramount of conspiracy to control first-run and subsequent-run theaters in Detroit. It was the first antitrust suit brought by producers against exhibitors alleging monopoly and restraint of trade. In 1948, the United States Supreme Court Paramount Decision ordered the Hollywood movie studios to sell their theater chains and to eliminate certain anti-competitive practices. This effectively brought an end to the studio system of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age. By 1958, many of the reasons for creating the SIMPP had been corrected and SIMPP closed its offices.

===Low-budget films===

The efforts of the SIMPP and the advent of inexpensive portable cameras during World War II effectively made it possible for any person in America with an interest in making films to write, produce, and direct one without the aid of any major film studio. These circumstances soon resulted in a number of critically acclaimed and highly influential works, including Maya Deren&#x27;s &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; in 1943, Kenneth Anger&#x27;s &quot;Fireworks&quot; in 1947, and Morris Engel, Ruth Orkin and Ray Abrashkin&#x27;s &quot;Little Fugitive&quot; in 1953. Filmmakers such as Ken Jacobs, with little or no formal training, began to experiment with new ways of making and shooting films.

&quot;Little Fugitive&quot; became the first independent film to be nominated for Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay at the American Academy Awards. It also received Silver Lion at Venice. Both Engel and Anger&#x27;s films won acclaim overseas from the burgeoning French New Wave, with &quot;Fireworks&quot; inspiring praise and an invitation to study under him in Europe from Jean Cocteau, and François Truffaut citing &quot;Little Fugitive&quot; as an essential inspiration to his seminal work, &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;. As the 1950s progressed, the new low-budget paradigm of filmmaking gained increased recognition internationally, with films such as Satyajit Ray&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Apu Trilogy&quot; (1955–1959).

Unlike the films made within the studio system, these new low-budget films could afford to take risks and explore new artistic territory outside the classical Hollywood narrative. Maya Deren was soon joined in New York by a crowd of like-minded avant-garde filmmakers who were interested in creating films as works of art rather than entertainment. Based upon a common belief that the &quot;official cinema&quot; was &quot;running out of breath&quot; and had become &quot;morally corrupt, aesthetically obsolete, thematically superficial, [and] temperamentally boring&quot;, this new crop of independents formed The Film-Makers&#x27; Cooperative, an artist-run, non-profit organization which they would use to distribute their films through a centralized archive. Founded in 1962 by Jonas Mekas, Stan Brakhage, Shirley Clarke, Gregory Markopoulos, and others, the Cooperative provided an important outlet for many of cinema&#x27;s creative luminaries in the 1960s, including Jack Smith and Andy Warhol. When he returned to America, Ken Anger would debut many of his most important works there. Mekas and Brakhage would go on to found the Anthology Film Archives in 1970, which would likewise prove essential to the development and preservation of independent films, even to this day.

===Exploitation boom and the MPAA rating system===

Not all low-budget films existed as non-commercial art ventures. The success of films like &quot;Little Fugitive&quot;, which had been made with low (or sometimes non-existent) budgets encouraged a huge boom in popularity for non-studio films. Low-budget film making promised exponentially greater returns (in terms of percentages) if the film could have a successful run in the theaters. During this time, independent producer/director Roger Corman began a sweeping body of work that would become legendary for its frugality and grueling shooting schedule. Until his so-called &quot;retirement&quot; as a director in 1971 (he continued to produce films even after this date), he would produce up to seven movies a year, matching and often exceeding the five-per-year schedule that the executives at United Artists had once thought impossible.

Like those of the avant-garde, the films of Roger Corman took advantage of the fact that unlike the studio system, independent films had never been bound by its self-imposed production code. Corman&#x27;s example (and that of others like him) would help start a boom in independent B-movies in the 1960s, the principal aim of which was to bring in the youth market which the major studios had lost touch with. By promising sex, wanton violence, drug use, and nudity, these films hoped to draw audiences to independent theaters by offering to show them what the major studios could not. Horror and science fiction films experienced a period of tremendous growth during this time. As these tiny producers, theaters, and distributors continued to attempt to undercut one another, the B-grade shlock film soon fell to the level of the Z movie, a niche category of films with production values so low that they became a spectacle in their own right. The cult audiences these pictures attracted soon made them ideal candidates for midnight movie screenings revolving around audience participation and cosplay.

In 1968, a young filmmaker named George A. Romero shocked audiences with &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, a new kind of intense and unforgiving independent horror film. This film was released just after the abandonment of the production code, but before the adoption of the MPAA rating system. As such, it was the first and last film of its kind to enjoy a completely unrestricted screening, in which young children were able to witness Romero&#x27;s new brand of highly realistic gore. This film would help to set the climate of independent horror for decades to come, as films like &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974) and &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; (1980) continued to push the envelope.

With the production code abandoned and violent and disturbing films like Romero&#x27;s gaining popularity, Hollywood opted to placate the uneasy filmgoing public with the MPAA ratings system, which would place restrictions on ticket sales to young people. Unlike the production code, this rating system posed a threat to independent films in that it would affect the number of tickets they could sell and cut into the grindhouse theaters&#x27; share of the youth market. This change would further widen the divide between commercial and non-commercial films.

However, having a film audience-classified is strictly voluntary for independents and there is no legal impediment to releasing movies on an unrated basis. However, unrated movies face obstacles in marketing because media outlets, such as TV channels, newspapers and websites, often place their own restrictions on movies that do not come with a built-in national rating, in order to avoid presenting movies to inappropriately young audiences.

===New Hollywood and independent filmmaking===

Following the advent of television and the Paramount Case, the major studios attempted to lure audiences with spectacle. Widescreen processes and technical improvements, such as Cinemascope, stereo sound, 3-D and others, were developed in an attempt to retain the dwindling audience by giving them a larger-than-life experience. The 1950s and early 1960s saw a Hollywood dominated by musicals, historical epics, and other films which benefited from these advances. This proved commercially viable during most of the 1950s. However, by the late 1960s, audience share was dwindling at an alarming rate. Several costly flops, including &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963) and &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (1969) put severe strain on the studios. Meanwhile, in 1951, lawyers-turned-producers Arthur Krim and Robert Benjamin had made a deal with the remaining stockholders of United Artists which would allow them to make an attempt to revive the company and, if the attempt was successful, buy it after five years.

The attempt was a success, and in 1955 United Artists became the first &quot;studio&quot; without an actual studio. UA leased space at the Pickford/Fairbanks Studio, but did not own a studio lot as such. Because of this, many of their films would be shot on location. Primarily acting as bankers, they offered money to independent producers. Thus UA did not have the overhead, the maintenance or the expensive production staff which ran up costs at other studios. UA went public in 1956, and as the other mainstream studios fell into decline, UA prospered, adding relationships with the Mirisch brothers, Billy Wilder, Joseph E. Levine and others.

By the late 1950s, RKO had ceased film production, and the remaining four of the big five had recognized that they did not know how to reach the youth audience. In an attempt to capture this audience, the Studios hired a host of young filmmakers (many of whom were mentored by Roger Corman) and allowed them to make their films with relatively little studio control. Warner Brothers offered first-time producer Warren Beatty 40% of the gross on his film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967) instead of a minimal fee. The movie had grossed over $70 million worldwide by 1973. These initial successes paved the way for the studio to relinquish almost complete control to the film school generation and began what the media dubbed &quot;New Hollywood.&quot;

Dennis Hopper, the American actor, made his writing and directing debut with &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969). Along with his producer/co-star/co-writer Peter Fonda, Hopper was responsible for one of the first completely independent films of New Hollywood. &quot;Easy Rider&quot; debuted at Cannes and garnered the &quot;First Film Award&quot; () after which it received two Oscar nominations, one for best original screenplay and one for Corman-alum Jack Nicholson&#x27;s breakthrough performance in the supporting role of George Hanson, an alcoholic lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union. Following on the heels of &quot;Easy Rider&quot; shortly afterward was the revived United Artists&#x27; &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (also 1969), which, like &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, took numerous cues from Kenneth Anger and his influences in the French New Wave. It became the first and only X rated film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; also held the distinction of featuring cameo roles by many of the top Warhol superstars, who had already become symbols of the militantly anti-Hollywood climate of NYC&#x27;s independent film community.

Within a month, another young Corman trainee, Francis Ford Coppola, made his debut in Spain at the Donostia-San Sebastian International Film Festival with &quot;The Rain People&quot; (1969), a film he had produced through his own company, American Zoetrope. Though &quot;The Rain People&quot; was largely overlooked by American audiences, Zoetrope would become a powerful force in New Hollywood. Through Zoetrope, Coppola formed a distribution agreement with studio giant Warner Bros., which he would exploit to achieve wide releases for his films without making himself subject to their control. These three films provided the major Hollywood studios with both an example to follow and a new crop of talent to draw from. Zoetrope co-founder George Lucas made his feature film debut with &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971), also released by Zoetrope through their deal with Warner Bros., announcing himself as another major talent of New Hollywood. By the following year, two New Hollywood directors had become sufficiently established for Coppola to be offered oversight of Paramount&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) and Lucas had obtained studio funding for &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973) from Universal. In the mid-1970s, the major Hollywood studios continued to tap these new filmmakers for both ideas and personnel, producing films such as &quot;Paper Moon&quot; (1973) and &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), all of which met with critical and commercial success. These successes by the members of New Hollywood led each of them, in turn, to make more and more extravagant demands, both on the studio and eventually on the audience.

While most members of the New Hollywood generation were, or started out as, independent filmmakers, a number of their projects were produced and released by major studios. The New Hollywood generation soon became firmly entrenched in a revived incarnation of the studio system, which financed the development, production and distribution of their films. Very few of these filmmakers ever independently financed or independently released a film of their own, or ever worked on an independently financed production during the height of the generation&#x27;s influence. Seemingly independent films such as &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; and others were studio films: the scripts were based on studio pitches and subsequently paid for by the studios, the production financing was from the studio, and the marketing and distribution of the films were designed and controlled by the studio&#x27;s advertising agency. Though Coppola made considerable efforts to resist the influence of the studios, opting to finance his risky 1979 film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; himself rather than compromise with skeptical studio executives, he, and filmmakers like him, had saved the old studios from financial ruin by providing them with a new formula for success.

Indeed, it was during this period that the very definition of an independent film became blurred. Though &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; was financed by United Artists, the company was certainly a studio. Likewise, Zoetrope was another &quot;independent studio&quot; which worked within the system to make a space for independent directors who needed funding. George Lucas would leave Zoetrope in 1971 to create his own independent studio, Lucasfilm, which would produce the blockbuster &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchises. In fact, the only two movies of the movement which can be described as uncompromisingly independent are &quot;Easy Rider&quot; at the beginning, and Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;They All Laughed&quot;, at the end. Peter Bogdanovich bought back the rights from the studio to his 1980 film and paid for its distribution out of his own pocket, convinced that the picture was better than what the studio believed — he eventually went bankrupt because of this.

In retrospect, it can be seen that Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975) and George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) marked the beginning of the end for the New Hollywood. With their unprecedented box-office successes, these movies jump-started Hollywood&#x27;s blockbuster mentality, giving studios a new paradigm as to how to make money in this changing commercial landscape. The focus on high-concept premises, with greater concentration on tie-in merchandise (such as toys), spin-offs into other media (such as soundtracks), and the use of sequels (which had been made more respectable by Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;), all showed the studios how to make money in the new environment.

On realizing how much money could potentially be made in films, major corporations started buying up the remaining Hollywood studios, saving them from the oblivion which befell RKO in the 50s. Eventually, even RKO was revived, the corporate mentality these companies brought to the filmmaking business would slowly squeeze out the more idiosyncratic of these young filmmakers, while ensconcing the more malleable and commercially successful of them. 

Film critic Manohla Dargis described this era as the &quot;halcyon age&quot; of the decade&#x27;s filmmaking that &quot;was less revolution than business as usual, with rebel hype&quot;. She also pointed out in her &quot;New York Times&quot; article that enthusiasts insisted this era was &quot;when American movies grew up (or at least starred underdressed actresses); when directors did what they wanted (or at least were transformed into brands); when creativity ruled (or at least ran gloriously amok, albeit often on the studio&#x27;s dime).&quot;

===Outside Hollywood===

During the 1970s, shifts in thematic depictions of sexuality and violence occurred in American cinema, prominently featuring heightened depictions of realistic sex and violence. Directors who wished to reach mainstream audiences of Old Hollywood quickly learned to stylize these themes to make their films appealing and attractive rather than repulsive or obscene. However, at the same time that the maverick film students of the American New Wave were developing the skills they would use to take over Hollywood, many of their peers had begun to develop their style of filmmaking in a different direction. Influenced by foreign and art house directors such as Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini, exploitation shockers (i.e. Joseph P. Mawra, Michael Findlay, and Henri Pachard) and avant-garde cinema, (Kenneth Anger, Maya Deren and Bruce Conner) a number of young film makers began to experiment with transgression not as a box-office draw, but as an artistic act. Directors such as John Waters and David Lynch would make a name for themselves by the early 1970s for the bizarre and often disturbing imagery which characterized their films.

When Lynch&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (1977), brought Lynch to the attention of producer Mel Brooks, he soon found himself in charge of the $5 million film &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980) for Paramount. Though &quot;Eraserhead&quot; was strictly an out-of-pocket, low-budget, independent film, Lynch made the transition with unprecedented grace. The film was a huge commercial success, and earned eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay nods for Lynch. It also established his place as a commercially viable, if somewhat dark and unconventional, Hollywood director. Seeing Lynch as a fellow studio convert, George Lucas, a fan of &quot;Eraserhead&quot; and now the darling of the studios, offered Lynch the opportunity to direct his next &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983). However, Lynch had seen what had happened to Lucas and his comrades in arms after their failed attempt to do away with the studio system. He refused the opportunity, stating that he would rather work on his own projects.

Lynch instead chose to direct a big budget adaptation of Frank Herbert&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Dune&quot; for Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis&#x27;s De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, on the condition that the company release a second Lynch project, over which the director would have complete creative control. Although De Laurentiis hoped it would be the next &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; (1984) was a critical and commercial flop, grossing a mere $27.4 million domestically against a $45 million budget. De Laurentiis, furious that the film had been a commercial disaster, was then forced to produce any film Lynch desired. He offered Lynch only $6 million in order to minimize the risk if the film had failed to recoup its costs; however, the film, &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986), was a resounding success, earning him another Academy Award for Best Director nod. Lynch subsequently returned to independent filmmaking, and did not work with another major studio for over a decade.

Unlike the former, John Waters released most of his films during his early life through his own production company, Dreamland Productions. In the early 1980s, New Line Cinema agreed to work with him on &quot;Polyester&quot; (1981). During the 1980s, Waters would become a pillar of the New York–based independent film movement known as the &quot;Cinema of Transgression&quot;, a term coined by Nick Zedd in 1985 to describe a loose-knit group of like-minded New York artists using shock value and humor in their Super 8 mm films and video art. Other key players in this movement included Kembra Pfahler, Casandra Stark, Beth B, Tommy Turner, Richard Kern and Lydia Lunch. Rallying around such institutions as the Film-Makers&#x27; Cooperative and Anthology Film Archives, this new generation of independents devoted themselves to the defiance of the now-establishment New Hollywood, proposing that &quot;all film schools be blown up and all boring films never be made again.&quot;

===Independent Cinema movement===

In 1978, Sterling Van Wagenen and Charles Gary Allison, with Chairperson Robert Redford, (veteran of New Hollywood and star of &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;) founded the Utah/US Film Festival in an effort to attract more filmmakers to Utah and showcase what the potential of independent film could be. At the time, the main focus of the event was to present a series of retrospective films and filmmaker panel discussions; however it also included a small program of new independent films. The jury of the 1978 festival was headed by Gary Allison, and included Verna Fields, Linwood Gale Dunn, Katherine Ross, Charles E. Sellier Jr., Mark Rydell, and Anthea Sylbert. In 1981, the same year that United Artists, bought out by MGM after the financial failure of Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980), ceased to exist as a venue for independent filmmakers, Sterling Van Wagenen left the film festival to help found the Sundance Institute with Robert Redford. In 1985, the now well-established Sundance Institute, headed by Sterling Van Wagenen, took over management of the US Film Festival, which was experiencing financial difficulties. Gary Beer and Sterling Van Wagenen spearheaded production of the inaugural Sundance Film Festival which included Program Director Tony Safford and Administrative Director Jenny Walz Selby.

In 1991, the festival was officially renamed the Sundance Film Festival, after Redford&#x27;s famous role as The Sundance Kid. Through this festival the Independent Cinema movement was launched. Such notable figures as Kevin Smith, Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, David O. Russell, Paul Thomas Anderson, Steven Soderbergh, James Wan, Hal Hartley, Joel and Ethan Coen and Jim Jarmusch garnered resounding critical acclaim and unprecedented box office sales. The significance of the Sundance Film Festival is documented in the work of Professor Emanuel Levy Cinema of Outsiders: The Rise of American Independent Film, (NYU Press, 1999; 2001).

In 2005, about 15% of the U.S. domestic box office revenue was from independent studios.

====Co-optation====

The 1990s saw the rise and success of independent films not only through the film festival circuit but at the box office as well while established actors, such as Bruce Willis, John Travolta, and Tim Robbins, found success themselves both in independent films and Hollywood studio films. &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; in 1990 from New Line Cinema grossed over $100 million in the United States making it the most successful indie film in box-office history to that point. Miramax Films had a string of hits with &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&quot;, &quot;My Left Foot&quot;, and &quot;Clerks&quot;, putting Miramax and New Line Cinema in the sights of big companies looking to cash in on the success of independent studios. In 1993, Disney bought Miramax for $60 million. Turner Broadcasting, in a billion-dollar deal, acquired New Line Cinema, Fine Line Features, and Castle Rock Entertainment in 1994. The acquisitions proved to be a good move for Turner Broadcasting as New Line released &quot;The Mask&quot; and &quot;Dumb &amp; Dumber&quot;, Castle Rock released &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, and Miramax released &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, all in 1994.

The acquisitions of the smaller studios by conglomerate Hollywood was a plan in part to take over the independent film industry and at the same time start &quot;independent&quot; studios of their own. The following are all &quot;indie&quot; studios owned by conglomerate Hollywood:
* Sony Pictures Classics (1992–present)
* Searchlight Pictures (1994–present)
* Paramount Vantage (1998–2013)
** Miramax (1979–present)
* Focus Features (2002–present)
* Warner Independent Pictures (2003–2008)
**Castle Rock Entertainment (1987–present)
* Marvel Studios (1993–present)

By the early 2000s, Hollywood was producing three different classes of films: 1) big-budget blockbusters, 2) art films, specialty films and niche-market films produced by the conglomerate-owned &quot;indies&quot; and 3) genre and specialty films coming from true indie studios and producers. The third category comprised over half the features released in the United States and usually cost between $5 and $10 million to produce.

Hollywood was producing these three different classes of feature films by means of three different types of producers. The superior products were the large, budget blockbusters and high-cost star vehicles marketed by the six major studio producer-distributors. Budgets on the major studios&#x27; pictures averaged $100 million, with approximately one-third of it spent on marketing because of the large release campaigns. Another class of Hollywood feature film included art films, specialty films, and other niche-market fare controlled by the conglomerates&#x27; indie subsidiaries. Budgets on these indie films averaged $40 million per release in the early 2000s, with $10 million to $15 million spent on marketing (MPA, 2006:12). The final class of film consisted of genre and specialty films whose release campaigns were administered by independent producer-distributors with only a few dozen or possibly a few hundred screens in select urban markets. Films like these usually cost less than $10 million, but frequently less than $5 million, with small marketing budgets that escalate if and when a particular film performs.

== Internationally ==
The independent film industry exists globally. Many of the most prestigious film festivals are hosted in various cities around the world. The Berlin International Film Festival attracts over 130 countries, making it the largest film festival in the world. Other large events include the Toronto International Film Festival, Hong Kong International Film Festival, and the Panafrican Film and TV Festival of Ouagadougou.

The European Union, specifically through the European Cinema and VOD Initiative (ECVI), has established programs that attempt to adapt the film industry to an increasing digital demand for film on video on demand services, outside of theatrical screenings. With this program, VOD offerings are paired with traditional movie screenings. There is also more of a push from EU National governments to fund all aspects of the arts, including film. The European Commission for Culture has an Audiovisual sector, for example, whose role is most notably to help distribute and promote films and festivals across Europe. Additionally, the Commission organizes policymaking, research, and reporting on &quot;media literacy&quot; and &quot;digital distribution.&quot;

==Technology and democratization==

As with other media, the availability of new technologies has fueled the democratization of filmmaking and the growth of independent film. In the late forties and fifties, new inexpensive portable cameras made it easier for independent filmmakers to produce content without studio backing. The emergence of camcorders in the eighties broadened the pool of filmmakers experimenting with the newly available technology. More recently, the switch from film to digital cameras, inexpensive non-linear editing and the move to distribution via the internet have led to more people being able to make and exhibit movies of their own, including young people and individuals from marginalized communities. These people may have little to no formal technical or academic training, but instead are autodidactic filmmakers, using online sources to learn the craft. Aspiring filmmakers can range from those simply with access to a smartphone or digital camera, to those who write &quot;spec&quot; scripts (to pitch to studios), actively network, and use crowdsourcing and other financing to get their films professionally produced. Oftentimes, aspiring filmmakers have other day-jobs to support themselves financially while they pitch their scripts and ideas to independent film production companies, talent agents, and wealthy investors. This recent technology-fueled renaissance has helped fuel other supporting industries such as the &quot;prosumer&quot; camera segment and film schools for those who are less autodidactic. Film programs in universities such as NYU in New York and USC in Los Angeles have benefited from this transitional growth.

===Crowdsourced funding===
The economic side of filmmaking is also less of an obstacle than before, because the backing of a major studio is no longer needed to access necessary movie funding. Crowdfunding services like Kickstarter, Pozible, and Tubestart have helped people raise thousands of dollars; enough to fund their own, low-budget productions. As a result of the falling cost of technology to make, edit and digitally distribute films, filmmaking is more widely accessible than ever before.

Full-length films are often showcased at film festivals such as the Sundance Film Festival, Slamdance Film Festival, South by Southwest Festival, Raindance Film Festival, Telluride Film Festival, and Palm Springs Film Festival. Award winners from these exhibitions are more likely to get picked up for distribution by major film distributors. Film festivals and screenings like these are just one of the options in which movies can be independently produced/released.

===Analog to digital===
The development of independent film in the 1990s and 21st century has been stimulated by a range of technical innovations, including the development of affordable digital cinematography cameras that can exceed the quality of film and easy-to-use computer editing software. Until digital alternatives became available, the cost of professional film equipment and stock was a major obstacle to independent filmmakers who wanted to make their own films. Successful films such as &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; (which grossed over US$248.6 million while only spending US$60,000) have emerged from this new accessibility to filmmaking tools. In 2002, the cost of 35 mm film stock went up 23%, according to &quot;Variety&quot;. The advent of consumer camcorders in 1985, and more importantly, the arrival of digital video in the early 1990s, lowered the technology barrier to movie production. The personal computer and non-linear editing system have taken away the use of editing stands such as the KEM, dramatically reducing the costs of post-production, while technologies such as DVD, Blu-ray Disc and online video services have simplified distribution; video streaming services have made it possible to distribute a digital version of a film to an entire country or even the world, without involving shipping or warehousing of physical DVDs or film reels. 3-D technology is available to low-budget, independent filmmakers. By the second decade of the 21st century high-quality cellphone cameras allowed people to make, edit and distribute films on a single inexpensive device.

One of the examples of such a new indie approach to filmmaking is the 1999 Oscar-nominated documentary film &quot;Genghis Blues&quot; that was shot by the Belic brothers on two Hi8 consumer camcorders and won that year&#x27;s Sundance Film Festival Audience Award for a Documentary. At the time, distribution was still film-based so the movie had to be &quot;filmed out&quot; from interlaced digital video format to film running at traditional 24-frame per second rate, so interlacing artefacts are noticeable at times. In 2004 Panasonic released the DVX100 camcorder, which featured film-like 24-frame per second shooting rate. This gave independent filmmakers the ability to shoot video at a frame rate considered standard for movies at the time and opened the possibility of clean digital frame to film frame conversion. Several acclaimed films were made with this camera, for example &quot;Iraq in Fragments&quot;. More recent devices allow &quot;filming&quot; at very high frame rates to facilitate distribution into a number of frame rates without artifacts.

Even though new cinema cameras such as the Arri Alexa, RED Epic, and the many new DSLRs cost thousands of dollars to purchase, independent films are still cheaper than ever, creating footage that looks like 35 mm film without the same high cost. These cameras also perform better than traditional film because of its ability to perform in extremely dark/low light situations relative to film. In 2008, Nikon released the first DSLR camera that could also shoot video, the Nikon D90. With the sensor larger than on a traditional camcorder, these DSLRs allow for a greater control over depth of field, great low-light capabilities, and a large variety of exchangeable lenses, including lenses from old film cameras – things which independent filmmakers have been longing years. With the creation of new, light-weight and accessible cinema cameras, documentaries have also benefitted greatly. It was previously impossible to capture the extreme wild of mother nature because of the lack of maneuverability with film cameras; however, with the creation of DSLRs, documentary filmmakers were able to reach hard-to-get places in order to capture what they couldn&#x27;t have with film cameras. Cameras have even been attached to animals to allow them to help film never-before-seen scenes.

New technologies have also allowed the development of new cinematic techniques originating in independent films, such as the development of the zoom lens in the early 20th century. The use of the (controversial) hand-held shot made popular in the groundbreaking &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; also led to an entirely new subgenre: the found-footage film. 

Independent filmmaking has also benefited from the new editing software. Instead of needing a post-house to do the editing, independent film makers use a personal computer or even just a cellphone with editing software to edit their films. Editing software available include Avid Media Composer, Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, (Color Grading Software) DaVinci Resolve, and many more. There are also many free tutorials and courses available online to teach different post production skills needed to use these programs. These new technologies allow independent film makers to create films that are comparable to high-budget films. Computer-generated imaging (CGI) has also become more accessible, transitioning from a highly specialized process done by post-production companies into a task that can be performed by independent artists.

Francis Ford Coppola, long an advocate of new technologies like non-linear editing and digital cameras, said in 2007 that &quot;cinema is escaping being controlled by the financier, and that&#x27;s a wonderful thing. You don&#x27;t have to go hat-in-hand to some film distributor and say, &#x27;Please will you let me make a movie?&#x27;&quot;

=== Camera phone filmmaking ===
Nowadays, high pixel camera phones are widely using also for mainstream film cinematography. &quot;New Love Meetings&quot;, a documentary shot on the Nokia N90, directed by Barbara Seghezzi and Marcello Mencarini in 2005 from Italy; &quot;Why Didn&#x27;t Anybody Tell Me It Would Become This Bad in Afghanistan&quot;, a docufiction film shot on Samsung, directed by Cyrus Frisch in 2007 from the Netherlands; &quot;SMS Sugar Man&quot;, a narrative film shot on the Sony Ericsson W900i, directed by Aryan Kaganof in 2008 from South Africa; &quot;Veenavaadanam&quot;, a documentary shot on Nokia N70, directed by Sathish Kalathil in 2008 from India; and &quot;Jalachhayam&quot;, a narrative film shot on the Nokia N95, directed by Sathish Kalathil in 2010 from India are the first noted experimental works with the first generation Camera phones.

&quot;Hooked Up&quot;, &quot;To Jennifer&quot;, &quot;Tangerine&quot;, &quot;9 Rides&quot;, &quot;Unsane&quot;, &quot;High Flying Bird&quot;, &quot;Ghost&quot;, &quot;Pondicherry&quot;, &quot;I WeirDo&quot; and &quot;Banger&quot; are some other examples shot on iPhones.

<doc id="378699" wikidata="Q5601568" url="?curid=378699" title="Greco Pizza">
<text>Greco Pizza is a franchise restaurant chain consisting of over 100 outlets in Eastern Canada. The restaurants also deliver pizza. Greco bills itself as the largest pizza chain in Atlantic Canada.

==History==
The first Greco Pizza opened in 1977 in Moncton, New Brunswick, as &quot;Greco Donair...and Pizza&quot;. In 1981, the franchise rights were sold to Grinner&#x27;s Food Systems Ltd. of Truro, Nova Scotia.

Many Greco locations in rural areas are known as &quot;Greco Express&quot; outlets; they are typically associated with a motel, convenience store, or other existing establishment. In some locations, the Greco franchise is associated with a Captain Submarine franchise, another of Grinner&#x27;s properties.

==Marketing==
Since 1995, Greco has marketed itself using the telephone number 310-30-30 with an associated jingle. From 1995 to the early 2000s, this number was pronounced in the official jingle as &quot;three one oh, three oh, three oh&quot;. In the early 2000s, this was changed to &quot;three ten, thirty thirty&quot;.

<doc id="378708" wikidata="Q874682" url="?curid=378708" title="Shanghai Communiqué">
<text>The Joint Communiqué of the United States of America and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, also known as the Shanghai Communiqué (1972), was a diplomatic document issued by the United States of America and the People&#x27;s Republic of China on February 27, 1972, on the last evening of President Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to China.

== Background ==
National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger was sent to China for secret diplomatic missions in 1971, which included early deliberations over the communiqué and planning for Richard Nixon to visit the country. Premier Zhou Enlai served as the Chinese liaison in the negotiations, with whom Kissinger had 25 hours of documented meetings. Kissinger did not use translators from the State Department due to concerns of leaking.

Kissinger&#x27;s secret visits involved seven drafts over the contents of the Shanghai Communiqué. Kissinger was initially interested in drafting a communiqué that only mentioned the mutual interests between the United States and China, but Zhou sought to include disagreements between their respective states in order to create a more meaningful document. This move towards an honest representation of relations impressed Kissinger, who increasingly held a favorable view on Chinese leadership.

Further negotiations over the communiqué took place with White House Chief of Staff General Alexander Haig representing the United States while preparing in China a month prior to Nixon&#x27;s visit. Informed by the 1969 Sino-Soviet border conflict, Haig emphasized the border threat that the Soviet Union posed to China and argued that there was a significant mutual interest between the United States and China in information sharing and otherwise militarily countering the Soviet Union. Zhou and Mao Zedong both viewed the remarks as disingenuous and ignorant of Chinese defense capabilities. However, they believed that Haig&#x27;s statements reflected a genuine desire from the United States for détente.

=== Nixon&#x27;s visit ===
During the February 1972 visit, the narrative of shared Sino-American interests in counteracting the Soviet Union were repeated numerous times by Nixon and Kissinger. Mao, when updated on Zhou Enlai&#x27;s meetings with the American delegation, continued to be skeptical of the helpfulness of the security proposals. Zhou was somewhat responsive towards specific offers from Kissinger for aid in early warning detection.

On February 25, disagreements over the contents of the communiqué arose within the American delegation. The communiqué at that point had recognized the security treaties the United States had entered with Japan and South Korea. Then Secretary of State William Rogers and diplomat Marshall Green rejected Nixon and Kissinger&#x27;s intentional lack of mention of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty signed with Taiwan in 1955, claiming that the absence was a betrayal of a close ally. Working with Qiao Guanhua, Kissinger resolved the disagreement on February 26 by removing all language pertaining to treaties.

The finished communiqué was signed on the evening of February 27, 1972 at the Jinjiang Hotel in Shanghai. Nixon left China the following morning.

== Document ==
The document covers three main aspects for the United States and China. The United States formally &quot;acknowledged&quot; that &quot;all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China&quot;. The use of the word &quot;acknowledge&quot; rather than &quot;accept&quot; is often cited as an example of the United States&#x27; ambiguous position regarding the future of Taiwan. The agreed Chinese translation renders &quot;acknowledges&quot; as &quot;cheng ren&quot; (), which connotes recognition and acceptance. In the communique, there is an excerpt that explains what bilateral trade would mean between the two countries. In the text it states, “Both sides view bilateral trade as another area from which mutual benefit can be derived, and agreed that economic relations based on equality and mutual respect are in the interest of the peoples of the two countries. They agree to facilitate the progressive development of trade between their two countries.”

The communiqué also included wishes of a peaceful coexistence and to expand the economic and cultural contacts between the two nations through bilateral trade, although no concrete steps were mentioned. Both nations agreed in the communiqué to increase &quot;people-to-people contacts&quot; and commerce prospects while also working toward the &quot;normalization&quot; of relations. The communiqué stated that the normalization of relations would contribute &quot;to the relaxation of tension in Asia and the world&quot;. In the communique it states, “... The two sides agreed that countries, regardless of their social systems, should conduct their relations on the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.”

Each country had something to gain from the communiqué. For the United States, this represented a geopolitical realignment to counter-balance Soviet influence. This alignment significantly weakened the Soviet Union&#x27;s strategic position in the Cold War and would become the demise of the Soviet Union and Soviet Bloc. The Communiqué made it possible for the United States to reorient its foreign policy and successfully isolate the Soviet Union. The Soviets now faced enemies on both the eastern and western fronts as a result of the Sino-American collaboration which upset the balance of power. This was especially clear during the arms race when the United States confronted China during negotiations with the Soviet Union on arms control, pushing them to take a defensive stance. Within the Communist bloc, ideological divisions were revealed and widened by the Shanghai Communiqué. Soviet hegemony was challenged by the distinct courses taken by countries like Yugoslavia and Romania. The communique exposed the fact that not all Communist nations adopted Moscow&#x27;s policies, undermining the legitimacy of Soviet doctrine and its capacity to keep its allies united. Nixon&#x27;s visit significantly changed the global power dynamics by opening the door to new trade opportunities with China and may have brought an end to the Cold War in East Asia. This would also open up opportunities for greater influence in China through engagement. On the other hand, China saw the end of their diplomatic isolation from the United States and gained international recognition. China also regained the seat in the United Nations from Taiwan.

== Legacy ==
The Shanghai Communiqué represented the United States&#x27; first direct public diplomatic negotiations with People&#x27;s Republic of China since its 1949 founding.

In a March 1972 visit to Taipei, US diplomat Marshall Green argued to Taiwanese Foreign Minister Chow Shu-Kai that the acceptance of the communiqué represented a change in PRC priorities. Namely, Green argued the communiqué demonstrated that the PRC valued peace with the United States above confrontation with Taiwan, and subsequently increased the security of Taiwan.

The aftermath of the Watergate scandal later in 1972 led Nixon to deprioritize further diplomatic efforts with the PRC.

Relations between the two countries were officially normalized with the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations. The communique was issued on January 1, 1979, the same day that the Taiwan Relations Act also entered into force.

In a February 2017 opinion piece for &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, National Committee on U.S.-China Relations president Stephen Orlins praised the Shanghai Communiqué for the cross-strait stability it offered for Taiwan. Orlins said the communiqué helps ensure confidence with Western investment in Taiwan because of the wide-ranging impacts of the opening of China and continued high-level cross-strait dialogue.

William F. Buckley Jr., the conservative anti-communist commentator, accompanied Nixon the trip, but was critical, however. He wrote an extensive attack in &quot;National Review&quot; of March 1972, calling the Communiqué a &quot;staggering capitulation&quot; that represented the loss of &quot;any remaining sense of moral mission in the world.&quot;

<text>The Executive Yuan () is the executive branch of the government of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Under the amended constitution, the head of the Executive Yuan is the Premier who is positioned as the head of government and has the power to appoint members to serve in the cabinet, while the ROC President is the head of state under the semi-presidential system, who can appoint the Premier and nominate the members of the cabinet. The Premier may be removed by a vote of no-confidence by a majority of the Legislative Yuan, after which the President may either remove the Premier or dissolve the Legislative Yuan and initiate a new election for legislators.

== Organization and structure ==

The Executive Yuan is headed by the Premier (or President of the Executive Yuan) and includes its Vice Premier, fourteen cabinet ministers, various chairpersons of commissions, and five to nine ministers without portfolio. The Vice Premier, ministers, and chairpersons are appointed by the President of the Republic of China on the recommendation of the Premier.

Its formation, as one of five branches (&quot;Yuans&quot;) of the government, stemmed from the Three Principles of the People, the constitutional theory of Sun Yat-sen, but was adjusted constitutionally over the years to adapt to the situation in the ROC by changes in the laws and the Constitution of the Republic of China.

* Aviation Safety Council, became an independent agency on 20 May 2012, later renamed Taiwan Transportation Safety Board
* National Disaster Prevention and Protection Commission: a task-force-grouped committee authorized by the law of Disaster Prevention and Protection. It was restructured as an implementation unit on 1 February 2010, and renamed to Office of Disaster Management.
* National Youth Commission, put under Ministry of Education as Youth Development Administration on 1 January 2013.
* Sports Affairs Council, put under Ministry of Education as Sports Administration on 1 January 2013.
* Coast Guard Administration, put under Ocean Affairs Council on 28 April 2018.
* Atomic Energy Council, restructured as the Nuclear Safety Commission on 27 September 2023.

=== Dissolved or ceased to function ===
* Government Information Office on 20 May 2012
* Council for Economic Planning and Development on 21 January 2014
* Research, Development and Evaluation Commission on 21 January 2014
* Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission on 15 September 2017

== Executive Yuan Council ==
The Executive Yuan Council, commonly referred to as &quot;The Cabinet&quot; (), is the chief policymaking organ of the ROC government. It consists of the premier, who presides over its meetings, the vice premier, ministers without portfolio, the heads of the ministries, and the heads of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The secretary-general and the deputy secretary-general of the Executive Yuan also attend, as well as heads of other Executive Yuan organizations by invitation, but they have no vote. Article 58 of the Constitution empowers the Executive Yuan Council to evaluate statutory and budgetary bills concerning martial law, amnesty, declarations of war, conclusion of peace or treaties, and other important affairs before submission to the Legislative Yuan.

== Relationship with the Legislative Yuan ==
The Executive Yuan Council must present the Legislators with an annual policy statement and an administrative report. The Legislative Committee may also summon members of the Executive Yuan Council for questioning.

Whenever there is disagreement between the Legislative Council and Executive Yuan Council, the Legislative Committee may pass a resolution asking the Executive Yuan Council to alter the policy proposal in question. The Executive Yuan may, in turn, ask the Legislators to reconsider. Afterwards, if the Legislative Council upholds the original resolution, the premier must abide by the resolution or resign. The Executive Yuan Council may also present an alternative budgetary bill if the one passed by the Legislative Committee is deemed difficult to execute.

== Executive Yuan Building ==
The Executive Yuan Building was built in 1940 as the new city hall for Taipei, on the site of Huashan Elementary School. After Taiwan was handed over to the Republic of China in 1945, Taipei&#x27;s city hall was moved to the former campus of Jian Cheng Elementary School. The old city hall building was turned over to house the provincial government for Taiwan. It became the Executive Yuan building in 1957.

The Executive Yuan building has been open to the public since 2003. It is accessible within walking distance east of Taipei Main Station or west of Shandao Temple Station of Taipei Metro.

<doc id="378724" wikidata="Q576355" url="?curid=378724" title="Endogenous growth theory">
<text>Endogenous growth theory holds that economic growth is primarily the result of endogenous and not external forces. Endogenous growth theory holds that investment in human capital, innovation, and knowledge are significant contributors to economic growth. The theory also focuses on positive externalities and spillover effects of a knowledge-based economy which will lead to economic development. The endogenous growth theory primarily holds that the long run growth rate of an economy depends on policy measures. For example, subsidies for research and development or education increase the growth rate in some endogenous growth models by increasing the incentive for innovation.

== Models ==

In the mid-1980s, a group of growth theorists became increasingly dissatisfied with common accounts of exogenous factors determining long-run growth, such as the Solow–Swan model. They favored a model that replaced the exogenous growth variable (unexplained technical progress) with a model in which the key determinants of growth were explicit in the model. The work of Kenneth Arrow (1962), , and Miguel Sidrauski (1967) formed the basis for this research. Paul Romer (1986), , and omitted technological change; instead, growth in these models is due to indefinite investment in human capital which had a spillover effect on the economy and reduces the diminishing return to capital accumulation.

The AK model, which is the simplest endogenous model, gives a constant-savings rate of endogenous growth and assumes a constant, exogenous, saving rate. It models technological progress with a single parameter (usually A). The model is based on the assumption that the production function does not exhibit diminishing returns to scale. Various rationales for this assumption have been given, such as positive spillovers from capital investment to the economy as a whole or improvements in technology leading to further improvements. However, the endogenous growth theory is further supported with models in which agents optimally determined the consumption and saving, optimizing the resources allocation to research and development leading to technological progress. Romer (1986, 1990) and significant contributions by Aghion and Howitt (1992) and Grossman and Helpman (1991), incorporated imperfect markets and R&amp;D to the growth model.

=== AK model ===
The AK model production function is a special case of a Cobb–Douglas production function:
: formula_1

This equation shows a Cobb–Douglas function where &quot;Y&quot; represents the total production in an economy. &quot;A&quot; represents total factor productivity, &quot;K&quot; is capital, &quot;L&quot; is labor, and the parameter formula_2 measures the output elasticity of capital. For the special case in which formula_3, the production function becomes linear in capital thereby giving constant returns to scale:

: formula_4

== Versus exogenous growth theory ==
In neo-classical growth models, the long-run rate of growth is exogenously determined by either the savings rate (the Harrod–Domar model) or the rate of technical progress (Solow model). However, the savings rate and rate of technological progress remain unexplained. Endogenous growth theory tries to overcome this shortcoming by building macroeconomic models out of microeconomic foundations. Households are assumed to maximize utility subject to budget constraints while firms maximize profits. Crucial importance is usually given to the production of new technologies and human capital. The engine for growth can be as simple as a constant return to scale production function (the AK model) or more complicated set ups with spillover effects (spillovers are positive externalities, benefits that are attributed to costs from other firms), increasing numbers of goods, increasing qualities, etc.

Often endogenous growth theory assumes constant marginal product of capital at the aggregate level, or at least that the limit of the marginal product of capital does not tend towards zero. This does not imply that larger firms will be more productive than small ones, because at the firm level the marginal product of capital is still diminishing. Therefore, it is possible to construct endogenous growth models with perfect competition. However, in many endogenous growth models the assumption of perfect competition is relaxed, and some degree of monopoly power is thought to exist. Generally monopoly power in these models comes from the holding of patents. These are models with two sectors, producers of final output and an R&amp;D sector: the R&amp;D sector develops ideas which grant them monopoly power. R&amp;D firms are assumed to be able to make monopoly profits selling ideas to production firms, but the free entry condition means that these profits are dissipated on R&amp;D spending.

== Implications ==
An endogenous growth theory implication is that policies that embrace openness, competition, change and innovation will promote growth. Conversely, policies that have the effect of restricting or slowing change by protecting or favouring particular existing industries or firms are likely, over time, to slow growth to the disadvantage of the community. Peter Howitt has written:
Sustained economic growth is everywhere and always a process of continual transformation. The sort of economic progress that has been enjoyed by the richest nations since the Industrial Revolution would not have been possible if people had not undergone wrenching changes. Economies that cease to transform themselves are destined to fall off the path of economic growth. The countries that most deserve the title of &quot;developing&quot; are not the poorest countries of the world, but the richest. [They] need to engage in the never-ending process of economic development if they are to enjoy continued prosperity.
== Criticisms ==

One of the main failings of endogenous growth theories is the collective failure to explain conditional convergence reported in empirical literature.

Another frequent critique concerns the cornerstone assumption of diminishing returns to capital. Stephen Parente contends that new growth theory has proved to be no more successful than exogenous growth theory in explaining the income divergence between the developing and developed worlds (despite usually being more complex).

Paul Krugman criticized endogenous growth theory as nearly impossible to check by empirical evidence; &quot;too much of it involved making assumptions about how unmeasurable things affected other unmeasurable things.&quot;

<text>The Regional Flag of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China depicts a white stylised five-petal Hong Kong orchid tree (&quot;Bauhinia × blakeana&quot;) flower in the centre of a Chinese red field. Its original design was unveiled on 4 April 1990 at the Third Session of the Seventh National People&#x27;s Congress. The current design was approved on 10 August 1996 at the Fourth Plenum of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The precise use of the flag is regulated by laws passed by the 58th executive meeting of the State Council held in Beijing. The design of the flag is enshrined in Hong Kong&#x27;s Basic Law, the territory&#x27;s constitutional document, and regulations regarding the use, prohibition of use, desecration, and manufacture of the flag are stated in the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance. The flag of Hong Kong was officially adopted and hoisted on 1 July 1997, during the handover ceremony marking the handover from the United Kingdom back to China.

== Current design ==

=== Symbolism ===
The design of the flag comes with cultural, political, and regional meanings. The colour itself is significant; red is a festive colour for the Chinese people, used to convey a sense of celebration and nationalism. Moreover, the red colour is identical to that used in the national flag of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, chosen to signify the link re-established between post-colonial Hong Kong and Mainland China. The position of red and white on the flag symbolises the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; political principle applied to the region. The stylised rendering of the &quot;Bauhinia × blakeana&quot; flower, a flower discovered in Hong Kong, is meant to serve as a harmonising symbol for this dichotomy. The five stars of the Chinese national flag are replicated on the petals of the flower. The Chinese name of &quot;Bauhinia × blakeana&quot; is most commonly rendered as &quot; (), but is often shortened to / () in official uses since &quot; () means &quot;foreign&quot; in Chinese, notwithstanding / refers to another genus called &quot;Cercis&quot;. A sculpture of the plant has been erected in Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong.

Before the adoption of the flag, the Chairman of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee Ji Pengfei explained the significance of the flag&#x27;s design to the National People&#x27;s Congress:
=== Construction ===

The Hong Kong government has specified sizes, colours, and manufacturing parameters in which the flag is to be made. The ratio of its length to breadth is 3:2. In its centre is a five-petal stylised rendering of a white &quot;Bauhinia × blakeana&quot; flower. If a circle circumscribes the flower, it should have a diameter 0.6 times the entire height of the flag. The petals are uniformly spread around the centre point of the flag, radiating outward and pointing in a clockwise direction. Each of the flower&#x27;s petals bears a five-pointed red star with a red trace, suggestive of a flower stamen. The heading that is used to allow a flag to be slid or raised onto a pole is white.

A slightly different geometrical description of the flag is specified in the mandatory National Standard &quot;GB 16689-2004: Regional flag of Hong Kong special administrative region&quot;.

=== Size specifications ===
This table lists all the official sizes for the flag. Sizes deviating from this list are considered non-standard. If a flag is not of official size, it must be a scaled-down or scaled-up version of one of the official sizes.

=== Colour specifications ===

The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance stipulates that &quot;The regional flag is in red, the chrominance value of which is identical with that of the national flag of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.&quot;

=== Manufacture regulations ===
The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance stipulates that the Hong Kong flag must be manufactured according to specifications laid out in the ordinance. If flags are not produced in design according to the ordinance, the Secretary for Justice may petition the District Court for an injunction to prohibit the person or company from manufacturing the flags. If the District Court agrees that the flags are not in compliance, it may issue an injunction and order that the flags and the materials that were used to make the flags to be seized by the government.

== Protocol ==
The Hong Kong flag is flown daily from the chief executive&#x27;s official residence, Government House, the Hong Kong International Airport, and at all border crossings and points of entry into Hong Kong. At major government offices and buildings, such as the Office of the Chief Executive, the Executive Council, the Court of Final Appeal, the High Court, the Legislative Council, and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices overseas, the flag is displayed during days when these offices are working. Other government offices and buildings, such as hospitals, schools, departmental headquarters, sports grounds, and cultural venues should fly the flag on occasions such as the National Day of the PRC (1 October), the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Establishment Day (1 July), and New Year&#x27;s Day. The flag should be raised at 8:00 a.m. and lowered at 6:00 p.m. The raising and lowering of the flag should be done slowly; it must reach the peak of the flag staff when it is raised, and it may not touch the ground when it is lowered. The flag may not be raised in severe weather conditions. A Hong Kong flag that is either damaged, defaced, faded or substandard must not be displayed or used.

=== Display ===
Whenever the Chinese national flag is flown together with the Hong Kong regional flag, the national flag must be flown at the centre, above the regional flag, or otherwise in a more prominent position than that of the regional flag. The regional flag must be smaller in size than the national flag, and it must be displayed to the left of the national flag. When the flags are displayed inside a building, the left and right sides of a person looking at the flags, and with his or her back toward the wall, are used as reference points for the left and right sides of a flag. When the flags are displayed outside a building, the left and right sides of a person standing in front of the building and looking towards the front entrance are used as reference points for the left and right sides of a flag. The national flag should be raised before the regional flag is raised, and it should be lowered after the regional flag is lowered.

An exception to this rule occurs during medal presentation ceremonies at multi-sport events such as the Olympics and Asian Games. As Hong Kong competes separately from mainland China, should an athlete from Hong Kong win the gold medal, and an athlete from mainland China win the silver and/or bronze medal(s) in the same event, the regional flag of Hong Kong would be raised in the centre above the national flag(s) during the medal presentation ceremony, and the Hong Kong flag would be the same size as the mainland China flag.

Another discrepancy was observed during the opening ceremonies of the 2009 East Asian Games. Normally, the organization&#x27;s flag and the host&#x27;s flag are raised to equal prominence and the organization&#x27;s flag cannot be smaller than any other flag. However, when Hong Kong hosted the 2009 East Asian games, three flags (the Hong Kong flag, the PRC flag, and the East Asian Games Association flag) were raised, with the Hong Kong flag on the left, the EAGA flag the same size on the right, and the PRC flag larger and higher than both flags in the centre, thus making the EAGA flag smaller than another opening ceremony flag.

In November 2018, the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; visited Hong Kong while displaying a United States flag and a Hong Kong flag of equal size with the Chinese flag absent. In previous visits by other US aircraft carriers in 2011 and 2014, the carrier&#x27;s display had included the Chinese flag. &quot;Stand News&quot; reported that both pro-democracy and pro-Beijing social media users interpreted the display as support for Hong Kong independence or Hong Kong sovereignty.

==== Half-mast ====
The Hong Kong flag must be lowered to half-mast as a token of mourning when any of the following people die:
*President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China
*Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress
*Premier of the State Council
*Chairman of the Central Military Commission
*Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference
*Persons who have made outstanding contributions to the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the Central People&#x27;s Government advises the Chief Executive.
*Persons who have made outstanding contributions to world peace or the cause of human progress as the Central People&#x27;s Government advises the Chief Executive.
*Persons whom the Chief Executive considers to have made outstanding contributions to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or for whom they consider it appropriate to fly the flag at half-mast.

The flag may also be flown at half-mast when the Central People&#x27;s Government advises the Chief Executive to do so, or when the Chief Executive considers it appropriate to do so, on occurrences of unfortunate events causing especially serious casualties, or when serious natural calamities have caused heavy casualties. When raising a flag to be flown at half-mast, it should first be raised to the top of the pole and then lowered to a point where the distance between the top of the flag and the top of the pole is one third of the length of the pole. When lowering the flag from half-mast, it should first be raised to the peak of the pole before it is lowered.

=== Prohibition of use and desecration ===
The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance states what manner of use of the Hong Kong flag is prohibited and that desecration of the flag is prohibited. It also states that it is a punishable offence for a person to use the flag in a prohibited manner or to desecrate the flag. According to the ordinance, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that &quot;publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling&quot; the flag is considered flag desecration. Similarly, the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance extends the same prohibition toward the Chinese flag. The ordinances also allow for the Chief Executive to make stipulations regarding the use of the flag. In stipulations made in 1997, the Chief Executive further specified that the use of the flag in &quot;any trade, calling or profession, or the logo, seal or badge of any non-governmental organisation&quot; is also prohibited unless prior permission was obtained.

==== Incidents ====
The first conviction of flag desecration occurred in 1999. Protesters Ng Kung-siu and Lee Kin-yun wrote the word &quot;shame&quot; on both the Chinese flag and the Hong Kong flag, and were convicted of violating the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance and the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance. The Court of Appeal overturned the verdict, ruling that the ordinances were unnecessary restrictions on the freedom of expression and in violation of both the Basic Law and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Upon further appeal, however, the Court of Final Appeal maintained the original guilty verdict, holding that this restriction on the freedom of expression was justifiable in that the protection of the flags played a role in national unity and territorial integrity and constituted a restriction on the mode of expressing one&#x27;s message but did not interfere with one&#x27;s freedom to express the same message in other ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;FACC000004/1999&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Leung Kwok-hung, a former member of the Legislative Council and a political activist in Hong Kong, was penalised in February 2001, before he became a member of the Legislative Council, for defiling the flag. He was convicted of three counts of desecrating the flag—for two incidents on 1 July 2000 during the third anniversary of Hong Kong&#x27;s handover to China and for one incident on 9 July of the same year during a protest against elections to choose the Election Committee, the electoral college which chooses the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. Leung was placed on a good-behaviour bond for 12 months in the sum of HK$3,000.

== Previous flags of Hong Kong ==

=== Pre-colonial period ===
==== Qing dynasty (1862–1895) ====

Prior to the secession of Hong Kong to the United Kingdom following the First Opium War via the Treaty of Nanking, Hong Kong fell under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government and flew the flag and ensign of the Chinese government of the time. Prior to the establishment of the crown colony of Hong Kong, the ruling dynasty in China was the Qing dynasty. Despite being established in 1644, the Qing Empire had no official flags until 1862. Prior to 1898, when the Second Convention of Peking was signed between the Qing Court and the government of the United Kingdom, the New Territories was still Qing land. The flag itself features the &quot;Azure Dragon&quot; on a plain yellow field with the red flaming pearl of the three-legged crow in the upper left corner.

=== Colonial flags ===
==== Use of Union Flag (1843–1871) ====
In 1843, a seal representing Hong Kong was instituted. The design was based on a local waterfront scene; three local merchants with their commercial goods are shown on the foreground, a square-rigged ship and a junk occupy the middle ground, while the background consists of conical hills and clouds. In 1868, a Hong Kong flag was produced, a Blue Ensign flag with a badge based on this &quot;local scene&quot;, but the design was rejected by Hong Kong Governor Richard Graves MacDonnell.

==== First colonial flag (1871–1876) ====
On 3 July 1869, a new design for the Hong Kong flag was commissioned at a cost of £3, which featured a &quot;gentleman in an evening coat who is purchasing tea on the beach at Kowloon&quot;. After a brief discussion in the executive council, it was determined that the new design was very problematic and it was not adopted.

In 1870, a &quot;white crown over HK&quot; badge for the Blue Ensign flag was proposed by the Colonial Secretary. The letters &quot;HK&quot; were omitted and the crown became full-colour three years later. It is unclear exactly what the badge looked like during that period of time, but it was unlikely to be the &quot;local scene&quot;. It should have been a crown of some sort, which may, or may not, have had the letters &quot;HK&quot; below it. In 1876, the &quot;local scene&quot; badge ( &quot;Picture of &quot;Ar Kwan&quot; Guiding the British soldier&quot;) was re-adopted to the Blue Ensign flag with the Admiralty&#x27;s approval.

====Second colonial flag (1876–1955)====
During a government meeting, held in 1911, it was suggested that the name of the colony appear on the flag in both Latin and Chinese scripts. However, this was dismissed as it would &quot;look absurd&quot; to both Chinese and Europeans. The flag which was eventually adopted featured the Blue Ensign together with a &quot;local scene&quot; of traders in the foreground and both European-style and Chinese-style trading ships in the background.

==== Japanese occupation period (1941–1945) ====
During the Second World War, Hong Kong was seized and occupied by the Empire of Japan from 1941 to 1945. During the occupation, the Japanese military government used the flag of Japan in its official works in Hong Kong.

====Third colonial flag (1955–1959)====
The flag was similar in design to that previously used. It featured a British Blue Ensign with a local waterfront scene.

====Fourth colonial flag (1959–1997)====
A coat of arms for Hong Kong was granted on 21 January 1959 by the College of Arms in London. The Hong Kong flag was revised in the same year to feature the coat of arms in the Blue Ensign flag. This design was used officially from 1959 until Hong Kong&#x27;s handover in 1997. Since then, the colonial flag has been appropriated by protestors, such as on the annual 1 July marches for universal suffrage, as a &quot;symbol of antagonism towards the mainland&quot;, along with a blue flag featuring the coat of arms, used by those advocating independence. The flag features a British Blue Ensign with the coat of arms of Hong Kong (1959–1997).

== Proposals before the handover ==
Before Hong Kong&#x27;s handover, between 20 May 1987 and 31 March 1988, a contest was held amongst Hong Kong residents to help choose a flag for post-colonial Hong Kong, with 7,147 design submissions, in which 4,489 submissions were about flag designs. Architect Tao Ho was chosen as one of the panel judges to pick Hong Kong&#x27;s new flag. He recalled that some of the designs had been rather funny and with political twists: &quot;One had a hammer and sickle on one side and a dollar sign on the other.&quot; Some designs were rejected because they contained copyrighted materials, for example, the emblem of Urban Council, Hong Kong Arts Festival and Hong Kong Tourism Board. Six designs were chosen as finalists by the judges, but were all later rejected by the PRC. Ho and two others were then asked by the PRC to submit new proposals.

Looking for inspiration, Ho wandered into a garden and picked up a &quot;Bauhinia × blakeana&quot; flower. He observed the symmetry of the five petals, and how their winding pattern conveyed to him a dynamic feeling. This led him to incorporate the flower into the flag to represent Hong Kong. The design was adopted on 4 April 1990 at the Third Session of the Seventh National People&#x27;s Congress, and the flag was first officially hoisted seconds after midnight on 1 July 1997 in the handover ceremony marking the handover. It was hoisted together with the national Chinese flag, while the Chinese national anthem, &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot;, was played. The Union Flag and the colonial Hong Kong flag were lowered seconds before midnight.

<doc id="378739" wikidata="Q7636588" url="?curid=378739" title="Sultan (card game)">
<text>Sultan, The Sultan or Sultan of Turkey is a patience or solitaire card game that uses two packs of playing cards. It is so named since a successful game rewards the player with a view of the Sultan (King of Hearts) surrounded by his harem of eight queens. This game is sometimes also called Emperor of Germany. Some skill is needed to achieve success. 

==Rules==

At the beginning of the game nine cards are laid out in the following arrangement:

These cards make up the foundations and will be built up by suit in order. On the single foundation with an Ace, the A♥ foundation, the next cards will be 2♥, 3♥, and so on. On the seven kings, the order is Ace, 2, 3, etc., of the appropriate suits. Throughout the game, the only card which you cannot place other cards on is the K♥ (the &quot;Sultan&quot;) in the center location. 

Six cards (or eight in some versions) from the deck are placed face-up around the foundations to make up the reserve, which in this game is sometimes referred to as the &quot;divan&quot;.

The player then makes one of three moves:
* Taking the top card from the face-down deck and placing it in the face-up waste pile.
* Taking the top card from the &quot;waste&quot; and adding it to one of the eight (outer) foundations.
* Moving a card from the reserve onto one of the eight (outer) foundations, and then replacing it with the next card from the deck.

The goal is to end the game with the &quot;Sultan&quot; (King of Hearts) surrounded by his &quot;Queens&quot;. 

When there are no more cards in the face-down deck, the player may re-deal (shuffle the waste and place them face-down, creating a new deck), but may only do this twice per game. The game is over after the player has run through the deck three times, or when all the cards are on the foundations.

<text>Calcium ions (Ca2+) contribute to the physiology and biochemistry of organisms&#x27; cells. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor, including several of the coagulation factors. Extracellular calcium is also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.

Plasma calcium levels in mammals are tightly regulated, with bone acting as the major mineral storage site. Calcium ions, Ca2+, are released from bone into the bloodstream under controlled conditions. Calcium is transported through the bloodstream as dissolved ions or bound to proteins such as serum albumin. Parathyroid hormone secreted by the parathyroid gland regulates the resorption of Ca2+ from bone, reabsorption in the kidney back into circulation, and increases in the activation of vitamin D3 to calcitriol. Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D3, promotes absorption of calcium from the intestines and bones. Calcitonin secreted from the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland also affects calcium levels by opposing parathyroid hormone; however, its physiological significance in humans is dubious.

Intracellular calcium is stored in organelles which repetitively release and then reaccumulate Ca2+ ions in response to specific cellular events: storage sites include mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.

Characteristic concentrations of calcium in model organisms are: in &quot;E. coli&quot; 3 mM (bound), 100 nM (free), in budding yeast 2 mM (bound), in mammalian cell 10–100 nM (free) and in blood plasma 2 mM.

==Humans==


In 2022, it was the 277th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 700,000 prescriptions.

===Dietary recommendations===
The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) established Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for calcium in 1997 and updated those values in 2011. See table. The 
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) uses the term Population Reference Intake (PRIs) instead of RDAs and sets slightly different numbers: ages 4–10 800 mg, ages 11–17 1150 mg, ages 18–24 1000 mg, and &gt;25 years 950 mg.

Because of concerns of long-term adverse side effects such as calcification of arteries and kidney stones, the IOM and EFSA both set Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for the combination of dietary and supplemental calcium. From the IOM, people ages 9–18 years are not supposed to exceed 3,000 mg/day; for ages 19–50 not to exceed 2,500 mg/day; for ages 51 and older, not to exceed 2,000 mg/day. The EFSA set UL at 2,500 mg/day for adults but decided the information for children and adolescents was not sufficient to determine ULs.

====Labeling====
For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For calcium labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 1000 mg, but as of 27 May 2016, it was revised to 1300 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake.

===Health claims===
Although as a general rule, dietary supplement labeling and marketing are not allowed to make disease prevention or treatment claims, the FDA has for some foods and dietary supplements reviewed the science, concluded that there is significant scientific agreement, and published specifically worded allowed health claims. An initial ruling allowing a health claim for calcium dietary supplements and osteoporosis was later amended to include calcium and vitamin D supplements, effective 1 January 2010. Examples of allowed wording are shown below. In order to qualify for the calcium health claim, a dietary supplement must contain at least 20% of the Reference Dietary Intake, which for calcium means at least 260 mg/serving.

*&quot;Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.&quot;
*&quot;Adequate calcium as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life.&quot;
*&quot;Adequate calcium and vitamin D throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.&quot;
*&quot;Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life.&quot;

In 2005, the FDA approved a Qualified Health Claim for calcium and hypertension, with suggested wording &quot;Some scientific evidence suggests that calcium supplements may reduce the risk of hypertension. However, FDA has determined that the evidence is inconsistent and not conclusive.&quot; Evidence for pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia was considered inconclusive. The same year, the FDA approved a QHC for calcium and colon cancer, with suggested wording &quot;Some evidence suggests that calcium supplements may reduce the risk of colon/rectal cancer, however, FDA has determined that this evidence is limited and not conclusive.&quot; Evidence for breast cancer and prostate cancer was considered inconclusive. Proposals for QHCs for calcium as protective against kidney stones or against menstrual disorders or pain were rejected.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that &quot;Calcium contributes to the normal development of bones.&quot; The EFSA rejected a claim that a cause-and-effect relationship existed between the dietary intake of calcium and potassium and maintenance of normal acid-base balance. The EFSA also rejected claims for calcium and nails, hair, blood lipids, premenstrual syndrome and body weight maintenance.

===Food sources===
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) web site has a very complete searchable table of calcium content (in milligrams) in foods, per common measures such as per 100 grams or per a normal serving.



===Measurement in blood===
The amount of calcium in blood (more specifically, in blood plasma) can be measured as &quot;total calcium&quot;, which includes both protein-bound and free calcium. In contrast, &quot;ionized calcium&quot; is a measure of free calcium. An abnormally high level of calcium in plasma is termed hypercalcemia and an abnormally low level is termed hypocalcemia, with &quot;abnormal&quot; generally referring to levels outside the reference range.

The main methods to measure serum calcium are:
* O-Cresolphalein Complexone Method; A disadvantage of this method is that the volatile nature of the 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol used in this method makes it necessary to calibrate the method every few hours in a clinical laboratory setup.
* Arsenazo III Method; This method is more robust, but the arsenic in the reagent is a health hazard.

The total amount of Ca2+ present in a tissue may be measured using Atomic absorption spectroscopy, in which the tissue is vaporized and combusted. To measure Ca2+ concentration or spatial distribution within the cell cytoplasm &quot;in vivo&quot; or &quot;in vitro&quot;, a range of fluorescent reporters may be used. These include cell permeable, calcium-binding fluorescent dyes such as Fura-2 or genetically engineered variant of green fluorescent protein (GFP) named Cameleon.

====Corrected calcium====
As access to an ionized calcium is not always available a corrected calcium may be used instead. To calculate a corrected calcium in mmol/L one takes the total calcium in mmol/L and adds it to ((40 minus the serum albumin in g/L) multiplied by 0.02). There is, however, controversy around the usefulness of corrected calcium as it may be no better than total calcium. It may be more useful to correct total calcium for both albumin and the anion gap.

=== Vertebrates ===

In vertebrates, calcium ions, like many other ions, are of such vital importance to many physiological processes that its concentration is maintained within specific limits to ensure adequate homeostasis. This is evidenced by human plasma calcium, which is one of the most closely regulated physiological variables in the human body. Normal plasma levels vary between 1 and 2% over any given time. Approximately half of all ionized calcium circulates in its unbound form, with the other half being complexed with plasma proteins such as albumin, as well as anions including bicarbonate, citrate, phosphate, and sulfate.

Different tissues contain calcium in different concentrations. For instance, Ca2+ (mostly calcium phosphate and some calcium sulfate) is the most important (and specific) element of bone and calcified cartilage. In humans, the total body content of calcium is present mostly in the form of bone mineral (roughly 99%). In this state, it is largely unavailable for exchange/bioavailability. The way to overcome this is through the process of bone resorption, in which calcium is liberated into the bloodstream through the action of bone osteoclasts. The remainder of calcium is present within the extracellular and intracellular fluids.

Within a typical cell, the intracellular concentration of ionized calcium is roughly 100 nM, but is subject to increases of 10- to 100-fold during various cellular functions. The intracellular calcium level is kept relatively low with respect to the extracellular fluid, by an approximate magnitude of 12,000-fold. This gradient is maintained through various plasma membrane calcium pumps that utilize ATP for energy, as well as a sizable storage within intracellular compartments. In electrically excitable cells, such as skeletal and cardiac muscles and neurons, membrane depolarization leads to a Ca2+ transient with cytosolic Ca2+ concentration reaching around 1 μM. Mitochondria are capable of sequestering and storing some of that Ca2+. It has been estimated that mitochondrial matrix free calcium concentration rises to the tens of micromolar levels &quot;in situ&quot; during neuronal activity.

==== Effects ====
The effects of calcium on human cells are specific, meaning that different types of cells respond in different ways. However, in certain circumstances, its action may be more general. Ca2+ ions are one of the most widespread second messengers used in signal transduction. They make their entrance into the cytoplasm either from outside the cell through the cell membrane via calcium channels (such as calcium-binding proteins or voltage-gated calcium channels), or from some internal calcium storages such as the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Levels of intracellular calcium are regulated by transport proteins that remove it from the cell. For example, the sodium-calcium exchanger uses energy from the electrochemical gradient of sodium by coupling the influx of sodium into cell (and down its concentration gradient) with the transport of calcium out of the cell. In addition, the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) obtains energy to pump calcium out of the cell by hydrolysing adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In neurons, voltage-dependent, calcium-selective ion channels are important for synaptic transmission through the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft by vesicle fusion of synaptic vesicles.

Calcium&#x27;s function in muscle contraction was found as early as 1882 by Ringer. Subsequent investigations were to reveal its role as a messenger about a century later. Because its action is interconnected with cAMP, they are called synarchic messengers. Calcium can bind to several different calcium-modulated proteins such as troponin-C (the first one to be identified) and calmodulin, proteins that are necessary for promoting contraction in muscle.

In the endothelial cells which line the inside of blood vessels, Ca2+ ions can regulate several signaling pathways which cause the smooth muscle surrounding blood vessels to relax. Some of these Ca2+-activated pathways include the stimulation of eNOS to produce nitric oxide, as well as the stimulation of Kca channels to efflux K+ and cause hyperpolarization of the cell membrane. Both nitric oxide and hyperpolarization cause the smooth muscle to relax in order to regulate the amount of tone in blood vessels. However, dysfunction within these Ca2+-activated pathways can lead to an increase in tone caused by unregulated smooth muscle contraction. This type of dysfunction can be seen in cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and diabetes.

Calcium coordination plays an important role in defining the structure and function of proteins. An example a protein with calcium coordination is von Willebrand factor (vWF) which has an essential role in blood clot formation process. It was discovered using single molecule optical tweezers measurement that calcium-bound vWF acts as a shear force sensor in the blood. Shear force leads to unfolding of the A2 domain of vWF whose refolding rate is dramatically enhanced in the presence of calcium.

==== Adaptation ====
Ca2+ ion flow regulates several secondary messenger systems in neural adaptation for visual, auditory, and the olfactory system. It may often be bound to calmodulin such as in the olfactory system to either enhance or repress cation channels. Other times the calcium level change can actually release guanylyl cyclase from inhibition, like in the photoreception system. Ca2+ ion can also determine the speed of adaptation in a neural system depending on the receptors and proteins that have varied affinity for detecting levels of calcium to open or close channels at high concentration and low concentration of calcium in the cell at that time.

==== Negative effects and pathology ====
Substantial decreases in extracellular Ca2+ ion concentrations may result in a condition known as hypocalcemic tetany, which is marked by spontaneous motor neuron discharge. In addition, severe hypocalcaemia will begin to affect aspects of blood coagulation and signal transduction.

Ca2+ ions can damage cells if they enter in excessive numbers (for example, in the case of excitotoxicity, or over-excitation of neural circuits, which can occur in neurodegenerative diseases, or after insults such as brain trauma or stroke). Excessive entry of calcium into a cell may damage it or even cause it to undergo apoptosis, or death by necrosis. Calcium also acts as one of the primary regulators of osmotic stress (osmotic shock). Chronically elevated plasma calcium (hypercalcemia) is associated with cardiac arrhythmias and decreased neuromuscular excitability. One cause of hypercalcemia is a condition known as hyperparathyroidism.

=== Invertebrates ===
Some invertebrates use calcium compounds for building their exoskeleton (shells and carapaces) or endoskeleton (echinoderm plates and poriferan calcareous spicules).

== Plants ==

=== Stomata closing ===

When abscisic acid signals the guard cells, free Ca2+ ions enter the cytosol from both outside the cell and internal stores, reversing the concentration gradient so the K+ ions begin exiting the cell. The loss of solutes makes the cell flaccid and closes the stomatal pores.

=== Cellular division ===
Calcium is a necessary ion in the formation of the mitotic spindle. Without the mitotic spindle, cellular division cannot occur. Although young leaves have a higher need for calcium, older leaves contain higher amounts of calcium because calcium is relatively immobile through the plant. It is not transported through the phloem because it can bind with other nutrient ions and precipitate out of liquid solutions.

=== Structural roles ===
Ca2+ ions are an essential component of plant cell walls and cell membranes, and are used as cations to balance organic anions in the plant vacuole. The Ca2+ concentration of the vacuole may reach millimolar levels. The most striking use of Ca2+ ions as a structural element in algae occurs in the marine coccolithophores, which use Ca2+ to form the calcium carbonate plates, with which they are covered.

Calcium is needed to form the pectin in the middle lamella of newly formed cells.

Calcium is needed to stabilize the permeability of cell membranes. Without calcium, the cell walls are unable to stabilize and hold their contents. This is particularly important in developing fruits. Without calcium, the cell walls are weak and unable to hold the contents of the fruit.

Some plants accumulate Ca in their tissues, thus making them more firm. Calcium is stored as Ca-oxalate crystals in plastids.

=== Cell signaling ===
Ca2+ ions are usually kept at nanomolar levels in the cytosol of plant cells, and act in a number of signal transduction pathways as second messengers.

<text>Anjalankoski is a former town and municipality of Finland. It had 16 379 inhabitants in 2008. About 4/5 of the people live in the vicinity of the Kymi River. The most densely populated communities are Myllykoski and Inkeroinen. In addition, there is plenty of countryside.

The town&#x27;s major industry is forestry along the Kymi Riverside. The paper factories Stora Enso Oyj and Myllykoski Paper Oy are the main employers together with the town itself.

Anjalankoski offered plenty of cultural and sport activities, including a football team, MyPa. The Anjala Manor Museum and surroundings is an interesting cultural site.

The municipality was unilingually Finnish.

Anjalankoski was formed in 1975 from the merging of the municipalities of Anjala and Sippola.

As of 2009, six municipalities – Kouvola, Kuusankoski, Elimäki, Anjalankoski, Valkeala and Jaala – were consolidated, accounting for the new municipality of Kouvola with a population of over 80,000, being the 10th largest city in Finland.

Near Anjalankoski (at 60° 41′ 32.34″ N, 27° 2′ 47.46″ E), there is 318 meter tall TV mast, which is one of the tallest man-made objects in Finland.

<text>Print-through is a generally undesirable effect that arises in the use of magnetic tape for storing information, in particular music, caused by contact transfer of signal patterns from one layer of tape to another as it sits wound concentrically on a reel.

==Explanation==
Print-through is a category of noise caused by contact transfer of signal patterns from one layer of tape to another after it is wound onto a reel.

Print-through can take two forms:

# thermo-remanent magnetization induced by temperature, and 
# anhysteretic magnetization caused by an external magnetic field.

The former is unstable over time and can be easily erased by rewinding a tape and letting it sit so that the patterns formed by the contact of upper and lower layers begin to erase each other and form new patterns with the repositioning of upper/lower layers after rewinding. This type of contact printing begins immediately after a recording and increases over time at a rate dependent on the temperature of the storage conditions. Depending on tape formulation and type, a maximum level will be reached after a certain length of time, if it is not further disturbed physically or magnetically.

==Audibility==
The audibility of print noise caused by contact printing depends on a number of factors:
# the amount of print due to conditions of time and storage; 
# the thickness of the base film that acts as magnetic barrier (thin C-90 cassette tapes are more susceptible than studio mastering tapes that use a base film four times thicker);
# the stability of the magnetic particle used in the tape coating;
# the speed of the tape (the wavelengths of the prints shift so that higher speeds move printed signal closer to the range where the ear is more sensitive); the dynamics of the musical program (very quiet passages adjacent to sudden loud signals can expose the print signal transferred from the loud signal); and the wind of the tape (A-winds for cassettes with the magnetic layer facing outward have stronger print signals after a loud signal--&quot;post-print&quot;—than B-winds used in modern open-reel recorders that have stronger &quot;pre-print&quot; signals preceding a loud passage. echo.

Tape speed is a factor because of the shift in wavelengths. For example, the strongest print signal on a C-60 cassette running at is about 426 Hz (605 Hz for a C-90), while an open-reel tape recorded at would have its strongest signal at 630 Hz if the tape were a professional tape with a base film or 852 Hz if the tape were a consumer version with a base film of thickness.

==Causes==
The cause of print-through is due to an imbalance of magnetic and thermal energy in the magnetic particle. Once the magnetic energy is only 25 times greater than the thermal energy, the particle becomes unstable enough to be influenced by flux energy from the layer above or below the tape. The amount of magnetic energy depends on the coercivity of the particles, their shapes (long, thin particles make stronger &quot;magnets&quot;), the ratio of ideally shaped particles to defective particles, and their crystalline structures. Metal particles, although very small, have very high values of coercivity and are the most resistant to print-through effects because their magnetic energy is seldom challenged by thermal energy. Particles fractured by excessive milling prior to coating will increase levels of print depending on their ratio compared to their well-formed neighboring particles.

Anhysteretic print signals are almost as strong as intentionally recorded signals and are much more difficult to erase. This type of print noise is relatively rare because users are typically careful about accidentally exposing recordings to strong magnetic fields, and the magnetic influence of such fields decreases with distance.

Digital tapes can also be affected by contact print effects in a phenomenon known as &quot;bit-shift&quot; when upper or lower layers of tape cause a middle layer to alter the pulses recorded to represent binary information.

==Video recording==
Since analog video is recorded by frequency-modulation of the video signal, the FM capture effect shields the signal against this noise; however, the linear audio and (depending on format) chrominance signals of a video cassette may have some print effects.

While print-through is a form of unwanted noise, contact printing was used deliberately for high-speed recording (duplication, high speed &quot;en masse&quot; copying) of video tape, instead of having to record thousands of tapes on thousands of VCRs at normal playback speed, or recording the source material repeatedly in real time to large reels (without end caps) of tape (called pancakes) over 48 hours long to be inserted into cassettes. DuPont in conjunction with Otari invented a form of thermal magnetic duplication (&quot;TMD&quot;) by which a high-coercivity metal mother master tape was brought into direct contact with a chromium dioxide copy (slave) tape. The coercivity of the mother tape is higher than that of the copy tape, so when the copy tape is heated and brought into contact with the mother tape, the copy tape gets a mirror image of the signal on the mother tape without the mother tape losing its signal. The recording on the mother tape was a mirror image of a valid video signal. Immediately before the copy tape came into contact with the mother tape, a focused laser beam heated it to its Curie point at which its value of coercivity dropped to very low values so that it picked up a near perfect copy of the mother tape as it cooled. The mother tape was made using a special reel to reel video tape recorder called a mirror master recorder and was held inside the machine in an endless loop. This system could achieve speeds of up to 300 times playback speed in NTSC VHS SP mode, 900 times in VHS EP mode and 428 times in PAL/SECAM tapes.

Sony developed a system known as &quot;Sprinter&quot; that used a similar mother master tape forced into close contact with any blank copy tape using compressed air and run across a rotating transfer head in which a weak AC high frequency sine wave is used to transfer the information anhysteretically to the copy tape with minimal erasure of the mother tape on each pass. The sprinter does not use a laser to heat the copy tape which saves on power consumption. The transfer head may have a vacuum cleaner to reduce dropout caused by dust. This system was used to quickly duplicate VHS tapes at speeds of up to 240 times faster than playback speed for NTSC and 342 times for PAL/SECAM video signals without having to use expensive chrome dioxide tape; the tape was fed into the sprinter at a speed of 8 meters per second. The mother tape was enclosed in a space (not in a reel, but rather in an endless loop) in the Sprinter; this was made possible by a horizontal vibrating tape feed system where the edge of the endless loop tape sits in a table that diagonally vibrates using vibration generated by piezoelectric elements and amplified using mechanical oscillation, causing the tape in the table to move forward. The copy tape was unwound, recorded using the mother tape, then wound onto large reels (called pancakes) containing enough tape for several VHS cassettes. The mother tape had a coercivity three times that of normal VHS tape and was made by recording onto it using a special reel to reel video tape recorder called a mirror mother VTR using video from a D-2 (video), Type B videotape or Type C videotape master source tape. The video tape recorder had a sapphire blade to clean the surface of the mother tape, reducing dropout caused by dust. Sprinter mother tapes did suffer enough loss that they had to be replaced after a number of passes. The master had to be replaced every 1000 copies. This form of high-speed recording was very cost effective when recording in the EP (extra long play) mode because it was three times faster than recording in SP (standard play) mode while real-time recording took the same amount of time whether in EP mode that used less tape or SP mode that used a greater amount of tape. High-speed video recording of EP video produced far more consistent results than real-time recording at the slowest VHS speed. After duplication, the copy tape was loaded into video tape loaders that wound the tape into empty VHS cassette shells that contained only leader tape.

<text>Enonkoski () is a municipality of Finland. It is encircled by the city of Savonlinna in the Southern Savonia region. It is the smallest municipality in Southern Savonia in terms of population.

==History==
Enonkoski was founded in 1882. Before that it was part of Kerimäki and Heinävesi. The major reason for the foundation of independent parish of Enonkoski happened in 1858. Enonkoski did not have its own church, and on Sundays people had to row to the church to Kerimäki, a parish Enonkoski was part of that time. In 1858 there was a church boat accident in the lake Ylä-Enonvesi, which led to the death of eight people. After that, a Russian businessman and a leader of an Enonkoski glass factory and a sawmill decided to build a church in Enonkoski. He is alleged to have said: &quot;the people in Enonkoski do not anymore have to drown on their trips to the church&quot;. The wooden church was built in the next year but it was destroyed in a fire caused by lightning in 1884. A new church made of wood, which is still in use, was built in 1886.

==Languages==
The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

There also is a Russian speaking minority.

==Religion==
The majority of the people living in Enonkoski are Evangelical Lutheran. There is a church in the centre of Enonkoski, built in 1886. The only Evangelical Lutheran monastery in Finland, the Monastic Protestant Community in Enonkoski, is located in Enonkoski.

==Transport==
Enonkoski has one main road which leads to Savonlinna, away. It also has other roads which lead to the small dock neighborhood called Hyypiänniemi and to another area known as Hanhivirta.

==Amenities==

Enonkoski is a very small town, with two small supermarkets, a gas station, a gift shop, several bakeries and cafés and a bar. It also has a retirement home called Iltasatu, which translates to bedtime story.

Towards the edge of the town, near a fire station, there is a running track with a well-kept field (usually used for association football) in the middle. In addition, there is a school which has an ice skating rink, used in the winter, and an indoor sports arena. Adjacent to the school is a library built in 1992. Enonkoski houses a rehab facility.

==Industry==
The largest business in the town is a fish research plant where they raise fish in a controlled environment and then release them into the lakes which are abundant in the area.

==Sport==
Enonkoski has a juniors and senior volleyball team Enonkosken Pyrintö playing in the second highest tier of men&#x27;s volleyball in Finland. Football club Karvilan Kivekkäät has a couple of youth teams and a women&#x27;s team that won the regional championship in 2009. There is also a cross country track used for cross-country skiing in winter and jogging in summer. Participation in the yearly skiing competitions is very high. Orienteering is also quite popular sport. The sports club for athletics, skiing and orienteering is called Enonkosken Urheilijat.

==Notable people==
* Antti Loikkanen (1955) is a Finnish former middle-distance and endurance runner (European indoor champion 1978)

==Villages==
Hanhijärvi, Ihamaniemi, Joutsenmäki, Karvila, Laasala, Makkola, Muhola, Paakkunala, Parkumäki, Simanala, Suurimäki and Vuorikoski are villages in Enonkoski.

==Border changes==
In 2009 the neighbouring municipalities of Enonkoski, Savonranta and the city of Savonlinna, unified as a one municipality. According to the law of Finland, the unifying municipalities must have a land connection between them, which Savoninna and Savonranta did not have. Because of that a land strip of was taken off from the area of Enonkoski municipality to connect the parts together. After Kerimäki and Punkaharju were consolidated with the town of Savonlinna on 1 January 2013, Enonkoski became completely surrounded by the emerging city.

<text>The Dender () or Dendre () is a long river in Belgium, the right tributary of the river Scheldt. The confluence of the two rivers is in the Belgian town of Dendermonde.

The Western or Little Dender is long and begins in Barry near Leuze-en-Hainaut at an elevation of about above sea level. It begins as several canals in the fields merging together to form the Little Dender. As such, it does not have any one specific source. The source of the Eastern Dender, which is long, is near Jurbise at a height of above sea level. The two rivers meet in the town of Ath. From that confluence, the river is called the Dender proper. From Ath, the Dender passes into the Denderstreek through the cities and towns of Geraardsbergen, south of which its tributary, the Mark, flows into it. From this confluence, the river continues to flow through Ninove, Denderleeuw, and Aalst, before ending in Dendermonde. The Dender is navigable up to Aalst for small ships up to 600 tons and further upstream for ships up to 350 tons. The Molenbeek-Ter Erpenbeek flows into the Dender at Hofstade.

<text>Asterias is a genus of the Asteriidae family of sea stars. It includes several of the best-known species of sea stars, including the (Atlantic) common starfish, &quot;Asterias rubens&quot;, and the northern Pacific seastar, &quot;Asterias amurensis&quot;. The genus contains a total of eight species in all. All species have five arms and are native to shallow oceanic areas (the littoral zone) of cold to temperate parts of the Holarctic. These starfish have planktonic larvae. &quot;Asterias amurensis&quot; is an invasive species in Australia and can in some years become a pest in the Japanese mariculture industry.

==History==
The genus &quot;Asterias&quot; was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758 when he published &quot;A. rubens&quot;. It was for a time the only species, but by the early 1800s a few dozen taxa had been described in this genus.

In 1825 Thomas Say listed six species native to the coasts of the United States (which at the time consisted of the east coast from Maine to Florida, which the US had just formally acquired from Spain a few years earlier). None of these species are accepted or recognised as &quot;Asterias&quot; today.

Johannes Peter Müller and Franz Hermann Troschel worked on starfish systematics in 1840, renaming the genus &quot;Asteracanthion&quot; and splitting a number of new genera from it.

William Stimpson rejected Müller and Troschel&#x27;s &quot;Asteracanthion&quot; in a paper presented on 4 December 1861, and named 16 new species, none of which are retained or included in &quot;Asterias&quot; at present. In 1875 Edmond Perrier formally reduced &quot;Asteracanthion&quot; to a synonym. Francis Jeffrey Bell listed 78 species in the genus in 1881, arranging them in some 16 unranked groupings (see artificial taxonomy).

A few years later, in 1889, Percy Sladen counted 48 or 49 species in the genus. He split the genus into at least six subgenera, of which subgenus &quot;Asterias&quot;, section β of the Pentactinid (5-armed) section contained at least four species, three of which are still accepted in the genus today.

In the early 1900s Addison Emery Verrill, working on the east coast of the US, added a number of new species to the genus, none of which are still in &quot;Asterias&quot;, and split the genus into numerous new genera and created new genera, moving almost all of the species now recognised as belonging to &quot;Asterias&quot; to his new genus of &quot;Allasterias&quot;. He accepted six species for the Pacific coasts of North America, none of which remain in &quot;Asterias&quot; at present. Soon after, and in the following two decades, Walter Kenrick Fisher, working in California, synonymised or removed all of Verrill&#x27;s species of &quot;Asterias&quot;, and synonymised Verrill&#x27;s new genera of &quot;Allasterias&quot; and &quot;Parasterias&quot; with &quot;Asterias&quot;, leaving the genus with four species, all of which are still recognised today. Ryori Hayashi synonymised one further Japanese species in 1940, leaving the genus with three species known since the previous century, all of which are still recognised today.

Alexander Michailovitsch Djakonov added two new species from Far East Russia in 1950 and reinstated the three species which were synonymised by Fisher and Hayashi, bringing the genus to eight species, although it took until the 2000s for some zoologists from the United States to accept his new species.

==Description==
&quot;Asterias&quot;, like most starfish genera in the order Forcipulatida, are recognisable externally by their pedicellariae, many thousands of tiny jaw-like structures on the skin which can snap shut to nip at prey or predators. &quot;Asterias&quot; has two types present -the major, also called straight, pedicellaria, which lie scattered across their skin, and the smaller minor, also called crossed, pedicellaria, which are found in tufts or wreaths around the large dorsal spines -these pedicellariae have tiny, rubbery stalks known as pedicels. Papulae are also present. All species normally have five arms. Internally, the exoskeleton also presents some diagnostic characters, such as the dorsal plates bearing only a single spine in their centre.

Sladen distinguishes it from the genus &quot;Uniophora&quot; by the presence of spines on its plates, instead of large, spherical tubercles; and from &quot;Anasterias&quot; by the well-developed, reticulate, abactinal skeleton.

==Species==
The World Register of Marine Species includes the following species: Distributions from Djakonov (1950).

<text>The vulnerability of Japanese naval codes and ciphers was crucial to the conduct of World War II, and had an important influence on foreign relations between Japan and the west in the years leading up to the war as well. Every Japanese code was eventually broken, and the intelligence gathered made possible such operations as the victorious American ambush of the Japanese Navy at Midway in 1942 (by breaking code JN-25b) and the shooting down of Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto a year later in Operation Vengeance.

The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) used many codes and ciphers. All of these cryptosystems were known differently by different organizations; the names listed below are those given by Western cryptanalytic operations.

==Red code==
The Red Book code was an IJN code book system used in World War I and after. It was called &quot;Red Book&quot; because the American photographs made of it were bound in red covers. It should not be confused with the RED cipher used by the diplomatic corps.

This code consisted of two books. The first contained the code itself; the second contained an additive cipher which was applied to the codes before transmission, with the starting point for the latter being embedded in the transmitted message. A copy of the code book was obtained in a &quot;black bag&quot; operation on the luggage of a Japanese naval attaché in 1923; after three years of work Agnes Driscoll was able to break the additive portion of the code.

Knowledge of the Red Book code helped crack the similarly constructed Blue Book code.

==Coral==
A cipher machine developed for Japanese naval attaché ciphers, similar to JADE. It was not used extensively, but Vice Admiral Katsuo Abe, a Japanese representative to the Axis Tripartite Military Commission, passed considerable information about German deployments in CORAL, intelligence &quot;essential for Allied military decision making in the European Theater.&quot;

== Jade ==

A cipher machine used by the Imperial Japanese Navy from late 1942 to 1944 and similar to CORAL.

==Dockyard codes==
A succession of codes used to communicate between Japanese naval installations. These were comparatively easily broken by British codebreakers in Singapore and are believed to have been the source of early indications of imminent naval war preparations.

==JN-11==
The Fleet Auxiliary System, derived from the JN-40 merchant-shipping code. Important for information on troop convoys and orders of battle.

==JN-20==
An inter-island cipher that provided valuable intelligence, especially when periodic changes to JN-25 temporarily blacked out U.S. decryption. JN-20 exploitation produced the &quot;AF is short of water&quot; message that established the main target of the Japanese Fleet, leading to a decisive U.S. victory at the Battle of Midway in 1942.

==JN-25==
JN-25 is the name given by codebreakers to the main, and most secure, command and control communications scheme used by the IJN during World War II. Named as the 25th Japanese Navy system identified, it was initially given the designation AN-1 as a &quot;research project&quot; rather than a &quot;current decryption&quot; job. The project required reconstructing the meaning of thirty thousand code groups and piecing together thirty thousand random additives.

Introduced from 1 June 1939 to replace Blue (and the most recent descendant of the Red code), it was an enciphered code, producing five-numeral groups for transmission. New code books and super-enciphering books were introduced from time to time, each new version requiring a more or less fresh cryptanalytic attack. John Tiltman with some help from Alan Turing (at GCSB, Government Communications Security Bureau) had &quot;solved&quot; JN25 by 1941, i.e. they knew that it was a five-digit code with a codebook to translate words into five digits and there was a second &quot;additive&quot; book that the sender used to add to the original numbers &quot;But knowing all this didn’t help them read a single message&quot;.

By April 1942 JN25 was about 20 percent readable, so codebreakers could read &quot;about one in five words&quot; and traffic analysis was far more useful. Tiltman had devised a (slow; neither easy nor quick) method of breaking it and had noted that all the numbers in the codebook were divisible by three. &quot;Breaking&quot; rather than &quot;solving&quot; a code involves learning enough code words and indicators so that any given message can be read. 

In particular, JN-25 was significantly changed on 1 December 1940 (JN25a); and again on 4 December 1941 (JN25b), just before the attack on Pearl Harbor.

British, Australian, Dutch and American cryptanalysts co-operated on breaking JN-25 well before the Pearl Harbor attack, but because the Japanese Navy was not engaged in significant battle operations before then, there was little traffic available to use as raw material. Before then, IJN discussions and orders could generally travel by routes more secure than broadcast, such as courier or direct delivery by an IJN vessel. Publicly available accounts differ, but the most credible agree that the JN-25 version in use before December 1941 was not more than perhaps 10% broken at the time of the attack, and that primarily in stripping away its super-encipherment. JN-25 traffic increased immensely with the outbreak of naval warfare at the end of 1941 and provided the cryptographic &quot;depth&quot; needed to succeed in substantially breaking the existing and subsequent versions of JN-25.

The American effort was directed from Washington, D.C. by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s signals intelligence command, OP-20-G; at Pearl Harbor it was centered at the Navy&#x27;s Combat Intelligence Unit (Station HYPO, also known as COM 14), led by Commander Joseph Rochefort. However, in 1942 not every cryptogram was decoded, as Japanese traffic was too heavy for the undermanned Combat Intelligence Unit. With the assistance of &quot;Station CAST&quot; (also known as COM 16, jointly commanded by Lts Rudolph Fabian and John Lietwiler) in the Philippines, and the British Far East Combined Bureau in Singapore, and using a punched card tabulating machine manufactured by International Business Machines, a successful attack was mounted against the 4 December 1941 edition (JN25b). Together they made considerable progress by early 1942. &quot;Cribs&quot; exploited common formalities in Japanese messages, such as &quot;I have the honor to inform your excellency&quot; (see known plaintext attack).

Later versions of JN-25 were introduced: JN-25c from 28 May 1942, deferred from 1 April then 1 May; providing details of the attacks on Midway and Port Moresby. JN-25d was introduced from 1 April 1943, and while the additive had been changed, large portions had been recovered two weeks later, which provided details of Yamamoto&#x27;s plans that were used in Operation Vengeance, the shooting-down of his plane.

==JN-39==
This was a naval code used by merchant ships (commonly known as the &quot;&quot;maru&quot; code&quot;), broken in May 1940. 28 May 1941, when the whale factory ship &quot;Nisshin Maru No. 2 (1937)&quot; visited San Francisco, U.S. Customs Service Agent George Muller and Commander R. P. McCullough of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s 12th Naval District (responsible for the area) boarded her and seized her codebooks, without informing Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Copies were made, clumsily, and the originals returned. The Japanese quickly realized JN-39 was compromised, and replaced it with JN-40.

==JN-40==
JN-40 was originally believed to be a code super-enciphered with a numerical additive, in the same way as JN-25. However, in September 1942, an error by the Japanese gave clues to John MacInnes and Brian Townend, codebreakers at the British FECB, Kilindini. It was a fractionating transposition cipher based on a substitution table of 100 groups of two figures each followed by a columnar transposition. By November 1942, they were able to read all previous traffic and break each message as they received it. Enemy shipping, including troop convoys, was thus trackable, exposing it to Allied attack. Over the next two weeks they broke two more systems, the &quot;previously impenetrable&quot; JN167 and JN152.

==JN-147==
The &quot;minor operations code&quot; often contained useful information on minor troop movements.

==JN-152==
A simple transposition and substitution cipher used for broadcasting navigation warnings. In 1942 after breaking JN-40 the FECB at Kilindini broke JN-152 and the previously impenetrable JN-167, another merchant shipping cypher.

==JN-167==
A merchant-shipping cipher (see JN-152).

==&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; incident==

In June 1942 the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, run by isolationist Col. Robert R. McCormick, published an article implying that the United States had broken the Japanese codes, saying the U.S. Navy knew in advance about the Japanese attack on Midway Island, and published dispositions of the Japanese invasion fleet. The executive officer of &quot;Lexington&quot;, Commander Morton T. Seligman (who was transferred to shore duties), had shown Nimitz&#x27;s executive order to reporter Stanley Johnston.

The government at first wanted to prosecute the &quot;Tribune&quot; under the Espionage Act of 1917. For various reasons, including the desire not to bring more attention to the article and because the Espionage Act did not cover &quot;enemy&quot; secrets, the charges were dropped. A grand jury investigation did not result in prosecution but generated further publicity and, according to Walter Winchell, &quot;tossed security out of the window&quot;. Several in Britain believed that their worst fears about American security were realized.

In early August, a RAN intercept unit in Melbourne (FRUMEL) heard Japanese messages, using a superseded lower-grade code. Changes were made to codebooks and the call-sign system, starting with the new JN-25c codebook (issued two months before). However the changes indicated the Japanese believed the Allies had worked out the fleet details from traffic analysis or had obtained a codebook and additive tables, being reluctant to believe that anyone could have broken their codes (least of all a Westerner).

<text>Accipiter () is a genus of birds of prey in the family Accipitridae. Some species are called sparrowhawks, but there are many sparrowhawks in other genera such as &quot;Tachyspiza&quot;.

These birds are slender with short, broad, rounded wings and a long tail which helps them maneuver in flight. They have long legs and long, sharp talons used to kill their prey, and a sharp, hooked bill used in feeding. Females tend to be larger than males. They often ambush their prey, mainly small birds and mammals, capturing them after a short chase. The typical flight pattern is a series of flaps followed by a short glide. They are commonly found in wooded or shrubby areas.

The genus &quot;Accipiter&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The type species is the Eurasian sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;). The name is Latin for &quot;hawk&quot;, from &quot;accipere&quot;, &quot;to grasp&quot;.

==Procoracoid foramen==

The procoracoid foramen (or coracoid foramen, coracoid fenestra) is a hole through the process at the front of the coracoid bone, which accommodates the supracoracoideus nerve. In some groups of birds it may be present as a notch, or &quot;incisura&quot;; or the notch may be partially or weakly closed with bone. In other groups the feature is completely absent.

The foramen is generally present in birds of prey, but it is absent in most &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks that have been studied. This absence is proposed as a diagnostic feature.

A study of accipitrid skeletons found procoracoid incisurae (as opposed to foramina) in some specimens of the eagles &quot;Aquila gurneyi&quot; and &quot;A. chrysaetos&quot;, but not in four other &quot;Aquila&quot; species. The notch was variably open or weakly ossified in &quot;Spizastur melanoleucos&quot;, &quot;Lophoaetus occipitalis&quot;, &quot;Spizaetus ornatus&quot;, and &quot;Stephanoaetus coronatus&quot;. Also the buteonine hawks &quot;Buteo brachyurus&quot; and &quot;B. hemilasius&quot; had incisurae, differing from 17 other &quot;Buteo&quot; species.

In &quot;Circus&quot; the foramen was found to be variable, not only within species but even between sides in the same individual. It is usually open or absent but may be closed by &quot;a thread of bone&quot;. Research in genetic phylogeny has since indicated that &quot;Circus&quot; is closely related to &quot;Accipiter&quot;.

The notch was also absent or indistinct in &quot;Harpagus bidentatus&quot;.

&quot;Urotriorchis macrourus&quot; has a well-developed procoracoid foramen, which suggests a separation from &quot;Accipiter&quot;. It may be related to the chanting goshawks in tribe Melieraxini.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Accipiter&quot; formerly contained around 50 species. A series of molecular phylogenetic studies found that the traditional arrangement was non-monophyletic. The publication of a densely sampled study of the Accipitridae in 2024 allowed the generic boundaries to be redefined. To create monophyletic genera, species were moved from &quot;Accipiter&quot; to five new or resurrected genera leaving only 9 species in &quot;Accipiter&quot;. The southeast Asian crested goshawk and the Sulawesi goshawk were found to be only distantly related to other species in &quot;Accipiter&quot;. They were moved to a resurrected genus &quot;Lophospiza&quot;, the only genus placed in the new subfamily Lophospizinae. Similarly, the very small south America tiny hawk and semicollared hawk were found to be only distantly related to species in &quot;Accipiter&quot;. They were moved to a newly erected genus &quot;Microspizias&quot; which together with &quot;Harpagus&quot; is placed in the subfamily Harpaginae. The genera &quot;Circus&quot;, &quot;Megatriorchis&quot;, and &quot;Erythrotriorchis&quot; were found to be nested within &quot;Accipiter&quot;. Rather than subsuming these genera into an expanded &quot;Accipiter&quot;, species were moved from &quot;Accipiter&quot; to the resurrected genera &quot;Aerospiza&quot;, &quot;Tachyspiza&quot; and &quot;Astur&quot;.

==List of &quot;Accipiter&quot; species==
There are 9 species in the &quot;Accipiter&quot; genus.

<text>Charles Olson (27 December 1910 – 10 January 1970) was a second generation modernist American poet who was a link between earlier modernist figures such as Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams and the third generation modernist New American poets. The latter includes the New York School, the Black Mountain School, and some of the artists and poets associated with the Beat generation and the San Francisco Renaissance.

Today, Olson remains a central figure of the Black Mountain Poetry school and is generally considered a key figure in moving American poetry from modernism to postmodernism. In these endeavors, Olson described himself not so much as a poet or a historian but as &quot;an archeologist of morning.&quot;
==Life==
Olson was born to Karl Joseph and Mary (Hines) Olson and grew up in Worcester, Massachusetts, where his father worked as a mail carrier. He spent summers in Gloucester, Massachusetts, which was to become his adopted hometown and the focus of his writing. At high school he was a champion orator, winning a tour of Europe (including a meeting with William Butler Yeats) as a prize. He studied English literature at Wesleyan University, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1932 before earning an M.A. in the discipline (with a thesis on the oeuvre of Herman Melville) in 1933. After completing his M.A., Olson continued his Melville research at Wesleyan during the 1933–1934 academic year with partial fellowship support. For two years thereafter, he taught English as an instructor at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts.

Olson entered Harvard University as a doctoral student in English in 1936. He eventually joined the newly-formed doctoral program in American Civilization as one of its first three candidates. Throughout his studies, he worked at Winthrop House and Radcliffe College as an instructor and tutor in English. Although he completed his coursework by the spring of 1939, he failed to finish his dissertation and take the degree. He then received the first of two Guggenheim Fellowships for his studies of Melville; a monograph derived from his master&#x27;s thesis and subsequent research, &quot;Call Me Ishmael&quot;, was published in 1947. His first poems were written in 1940.

In 1941, Olson moved to New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village and began living with Constance &quot;Connie&quot; Wilcock in a common-law marriage; they had one child, Katherine. During this period, he was employed as the publicity director for the American Civil Liberties Union (May 1941 – July 1941) and as chief of the Common Council for American Unity&#x27;s Foreign Language Information Service (November 1941 – September 1942). At that point, they moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked in the Foreign Language Division of the Office of War Information, eventually rising to associate chief under Alan Cranston.

Upset about the increasing censorship of his news releases, Olson went to work for the Democratic National Committee as director of the Foreign Nationalities Division in May 1944. In this capacity, he participated in Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s 1944 presidential campaign, organizing &quot;Everyone for Roosevelt&quot;, a large campaign rally at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. Following Roosevelt&#x27;s re-election to an unprecedented fourth term, he wintered in Key West, Florida. In January 1945, he was offered his choice of two positions (including Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and the Cabinet-rank Postmaster General) in the Roosevelt administration. Increasingly disenchanted with politics, he turned down both posts.

The death of Roosevelt and concomitant ascendancy of Harry Truman in April 1945 inspired Olson to dedicate himself to a literary career. From 1946 to 1948, Olson visited Ezra Pound at St. Elizabeths Hospital, drawn to the poet and his work though repelled by some of his political ideas.

In September 1948, Olson became a visiting professor at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, replacing longtime friend Edward Dahlberg for the academic year. There, he would work and study beside such artists as the composer John Cage and the poet Robert Creeley. He subsequently joined the permanent faculty at the invitation of the student body in 1951 and became Rector shortly thereafter. While at Black Mountain, he had a second child, Charles Peter Olson, with one of his students, Betty Kaiser. Kaiser became Olson&#x27;s second common-law wife following his separation from Wilcock in 1956.

Despite financial difficulties and Olson&#x27;s eccentric administrative style, Black Mountain College continued to support work by Cage, Creeley, Allen Ginsberg, Robert Duncan, Fielding Dawson, Cy Twombly, Jonathan Williams, Ed Dorn, Stan Brakhage, and many other members of the 1950s American avant-garde throughout Olson&#x27;s rectorship. Olson&#x27;s influence has been cited by artists in other media, including Carolee Schneemann and James Tenney.

Olson&#x27;s ideas came to influence a generation of poets, including writers Duncan, Dorn, Denise Levertov, and Paul Blackburn. At 204 cm (6&#x27;8&quot;), Olson was described as &quot;a bear of a man&quot;, his stature possibly influencing the title of his &quot;Maximus&quot; work. Olson wrote copious personal letters and helped and encouraged many young writers. His transdisciplinary poetics were informed by a range of disparate and learned sources, including Mayan writing, Sumerian religion, classical mythology, Alfred North Whitehead&#x27;s process philosophy (as exemplified by &quot;Process and Reality&quot; [1929]) and cybernetics. Shortly before his death, he examined the possibility that Chinese and Indo-European languages derived from a common source.

When Black Mountain College closed in 1956, Olson oversaw the resolution of the institution&#x27;s debts over the next five years and settled in Gloucester. He participated in early psilocybin experiments under the aegis of Timothy Leary in 1961 and Henry Murray and served as a distinguished professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo (1963-1965) and visiting professor at the University of Connecticut (1969). From 1965 until his death, Olson received a generous, informal annuity (nominally rendered for his services as editorial consultant to Frontier Press) from philanthropist and publisher Harvey Brown, a former graduate student at Buffalo; this enabled him to take an indefinite leave of absence from his Buffalo professorship and return to Gloucester.

In January 1964, Kaiser was killed by a drunk driver in a head-on automobile accident, although a grieving Olson incorrectly theorized her death as a potential suicide because of her dissatisfaction with her life in the Buffalo area. Her death precipitated Olson into an existential mixture of extreme isolation, romantic longing, and frenzied work. Much of his life was affected by his heavy smoking and drinking, which contributed to his early death from liver cancer. Following his diagnosis, he was transferred to New York Hospital for a liver operation, which never occurred. He died there in 1970, two weeks past his fifty-ninth birthday, while in the process of completing his epic, &quot;The Maximus Poems&quot;.

==Work==
===Early writings===
Olson&#x27;s first book, &quot;Call Me Ishmael&quot; (1947), a study of Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, was a continuation of his M.A. thesis at Wesleyan University.

In &quot;Projective Verse&quot; (1950), Olson called for a poetic meter based on the poet&#x27;s breathing and an open construction based on sound and the linking of perceptions rather than syntax and logic. He favored metre not based on syllable, stress, foot or line but using only the unit of the breath. In this respect Olson was foreshadowed by Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s poetic theory on breath. The presentation of the poem on the page was for him central to the work becoming at once fully aural and fully visual The poem &quot;The Kingfishers&quot; is an application of the manifesto. It was first published in 1949 and collected in his first book of poetry, &quot;In Cold Hell, in Thicket&quot; (1953). His second collection, &quot;The Distances&quot;, was published in 1960.

Olson&#x27;s reputation rests in the main on his complex, sometimes difficult poems such as &quot;The Kingfishers&quot;, &quot;In Cold Hell, in Thicket&quot;, and &quot;The Maximus Poems&quot;, work that tends to explore social, historical, and political concerns. His shorter verse, poems such as &quot;Only The Red Fox, Only The Crow&quot;, &quot;Other Than&quot;, &quot;An Ode on Nativity&quot;, &quot;Love&quot;, and &quot;The Ring Of&quot; are more immediately accessible and manifest a sincere, original, emotionally powerful voice. &quot;Letter 27 [withheld]&quot; from &quot;The Maximus Poems&quot; weds Olson&#x27;s lyric, historic, and aesthetic concerns. Olson coined the term postmodern in a letter of August 1951 to Robert Creeley.

===&quot;The Maximus Poems&quot;===
In 1950, inspired by the example of Pound&#x27;s &quot;Cantos&quot; (though Olson denied any direct relation between the two epics), Olson began writing &quot;The Maximus Poems&quot;. An exploration of American history in the broadest sense, &quot;Maximus&quot; is also an epic of place, situated in Massachusetts and specifically the city of Gloucester where Olson had settled. Dogtown, the wild, rock-strewn centre of Cape Ann, next to Gloucester, is an important place in &quot;The Maximus Poems&quot;. (Olson used to write outside while sitting on a tree-stump in Dogtown.)

The whole work is also mediated through the voice of Maximus, based partly on Maximus of Tyre, an itinerant Greek philosopher, and partly on Olson himself. The last of the three volumes imagines an ideal Gloucester in which communal values have replaced commercial ones. When Olson knew he was dying of cancer, he instructed his literary executor Charles Boer and others to organize and produce the final book in the sequence following Olson&#x27;s death.

<doc id="378771" wikidata="Q1459952" url="?curid=378771" title="Pedicellaria">
<text>A pedicellaria (: pedicellariae) is a small wrench- or claw-shaped appendage with movable jaws, called valves, commonly found on echinoderms (phylum Echinodermata), particularly in sea stars (class Asteroidea) and sea urchins (class Echinoidea).
Each pedicellaria is an organ with its own set of muscles, neuropils, and sensory receptors and is therefore capable of reflex responses to the environment.
Pedicellariae are poorly understood but in some taxa, they are thought to keep the body surface clear of algae, encrusting organisms, and other debris in conjunction with the ciliated epidermis present in all echinoderms.

These structures are derived from the mesodermal skeleton.

== In sea stars ==

=== Types ===
There are two major types of pedicellaria in sea stars: straight and crossed. Straight pedicellaria are typically larger and located on the body surface, whereas crossed pedicellaria are smaller and found more commonly on stalks, raised above the body surface or in clumps circling the spines. The crossed type is connected to the test by an elastic ligament.
=== Location ===
Sea star pedicellariae may be located on the test&#x27;s surface or mounted on flexible stalks. Depending on the species, pedicellariae may be surrounding the spines, on the surface of the animal&#x27;s body, in pits on the abactinal, marginal, or actinal surface, and/or within the adambulacral plate adjacent to the tube foot furrow. &quot;Forcipulate&quot; sea star are so called because each pedicellaria is typically composed of three forceps-like valves. Other asteroids can have pedicellariae composed of only two components.

=== Function ===
Pedicellariae in some taxa, such as the deep-sea Brisingida, and the Antarctic &quot;Labidiaster&quot; are known to function in food capture.

== In sea urchins ==

=== Types ===
Four main forms of pedicellariae are found in sea urchins : tridactylous, ophicephalous, triphyllous and globiferous. There are typically three valves that make up the jaw of sea urchin pedicellaria. The stalk is composed of a skeletal rod and a flexible neck portion.
=== Location ===
They are generally attached by a long, inflexible stalk and may be found anywhere on the sea urchin&#x27;s test.
=== Function ===
In some families, globigerous pedicellariae have evolved into venomous structures, used for protection or maybe hunting. This is particularly the case in the family Toxopneustidae, some species such as &quot;Tripneustes gratilla&quot; and especially &quot;Toxopneustes pileolus&quot; being extremely venomous.

<text>Shivini (), also known as Siuini, Artinis, Ardinis, was a solar god in the mythology of the Iron Age kingdom of Urartu in the Armenian Highlands. He is the third god in a triad with Khaldi and Theispas. The Assyrian god Shamash is a counterpart to Shivini. He was depicted as a man on his knees, holding up a solar disc. His wife was most likely a goddess called Tushpuea who is listed as the third goddess on the Mheri-Dur inscription.

Armen Petrosyan and other scholars argue that his name derives from a Hittite source, and is, therefore, of the same Indo-European origin as the names of Ancient Greek Zeus and Roman Jupiter.

<doc id="378783" wikidata="Q587698" url="?curid=378783" title="Ectotherm">
<text>An ectotherm (from the Greek () &quot;outside&quot; and () &quot;heat&quot;), more commonly referred to as a &quot;cold-blooded animal&quot;, is an animal in which internal physiological sources of heat, such as blood, are of relatively small or of quite negligible importance in controlling body temperature. Such organisms (frogs, for example) rely on environmental heat sources, which permit them to operate at very economical metabolic rates. 

Some of these animals live in environments where temperatures are practically constant, as is typical of regions of the abyssal ocean and hence can be regarded as homeothermic ectotherms. In contrast, in places where temperature varies so widely as to limit the physiological activities of other kinds of ectotherms, many species habitually seek out external sources of heat or shelter from heat; for example, many reptiles regulate their body temperature by in the sun, or seeking shade when necessary in addition to a host of other behavioral thermoregulation mechanisms.

In contrast to ectotherms, endotherms rely largely, even predominantly, on heat from internal metabolic processes, and mesotherms use an intermediate strategy.

Because there are more than two categories of temperature control utilized by animals, the terms &quot;warm-blooded&quot; and cold-blooded have been deprecated as scientific terms.

==Adaptations==
Various patterns of behavior enable certain ectotherms to regulate body temperature to a useful extent. To warm up, reptiles and many insects find sunny places and adopt positions that maximise their exposure; at harmfully high temperatures they seek shade or cooler water. In cold weather, honey bees huddle together to retain heat. Butterflies and moths may orient their wings to maximize exposure to solar radiation in order to build up heat before take-off. Gregarious caterpillars, such as the forest tent caterpillar and fall webworm, benefit from basking in large groups for thermoregulation. Many flying insects, such as honey bees and bumble bees, also raise their internal temperatures endothermally prior to flight, by vibrating their flight muscles without violent movement of the wings. Such endothermal activity is an example of the difficulty of consistent application of terms such as poikilothermy and homeothermy.

In addition to behavioral adaptations, physiological adaptations help ectotherms regulate temperature. Diving reptiles conserve heat by heat exchange mechanisms, whereby cold blood from the skin picks up heat from blood moving outward from the body core, re-using and thereby conserving some of the heat that otherwise would have been wasted. The skin of bullfrogs secretes more mucus when it is hot, allowing more cooling by evaporation.

During periods of cold, some ectotherms enter a state of torpor, in which their metabolism slows or, in some cases, such as the wood frog, effectively stops. The torpor might last overnight or last for a season, or even for years, depending on the species and circumstances.

Owners of reptiles may use an ultraviolet light system to assist their pets&#x27; basking.

==Pros and cons==
Ectotherms rely largely on external heat sources such as sunlight to achieve their optimal body temperature for various bodily activities. Accordingly, they depend on ambient conditions to reach operational body temperatures. In contrast, endothermic animals maintain nearly constant high operational body temperatures largely by reliance on internal heat produced by metabolically active organs (liver, kidney, heart, brain, muscle) or even by specialized heat producing organs like brown adipose tissue. Ectotherms typically have lower metabolic rates than endotherms at a given body mass. As a consequence, endotherms generally rely on higher food consumption, and commonly on food of higher energy content. Such requirements may limit the carrying capacity of a given environment for endotherms as compared to its carrying capacity for ectotherms.

Because ectotherms depend on environmental conditions for body temperature regulation, as a rule, they are more sluggish at night and in early mornings. When they emerge from shelter, many diurnal ectotherms need to heat up in the early sunlight before they can begin their daily activities. In cool weather the foraging activity of such species is therefore restricted to the day time in most vertebrate ectotherms, and in cold climates most cannot survive at all. In lizards, for instance, most nocturnal species are geckos specialising in &quot;sit and wait&quot; foraging strategies. Such strategies do not require as much energy as active foraging and do not require hunting activity of the same intensity. From another point of view, sit-and-wait predation may require very long periods of unproductive waiting. Endotherms cannot, in general, afford such long periods without food, but suitably adapted ectotherms can wait without expending much energy. Endothermic vertebrate species are therefore less dependent on the environmental conditions and have developed a higher variability (both within and between species) in their daily patterns of activity.

In ectotherms, fluctuating ambient temperatures may affect the body temperature. Such variation in body temperature is called &quot;poikilothermy&quot;, though the concept is not widely satisfactory and the use of the term is declining. In small aquatic creatures such as Rotifera, poikilothermy is practically absolute, but other creatures (like crabs) have wider physiological options at their disposal, and they can move to preferred temperatures, avoid ambient temperature changes, or moderate their effects. Ectotherms can also display the features of homeothermy, especially within aquatic organisms. Normally their range of ambient environmental temperatures is relatively constant, and there are few in number that attempt to maintain a higher internal temperature due to the high associated costs.

<doc id="378787" wikidata="Q1937315" url="?curid=378787" title="Helix (gastropod)">
<text>Helix is a genus of large, air-breathing land snails native to the western Palaearctic and characterized by a globular shell.

It is the type genus of the family Helicidae, and one of the animal genera described by Carl Linnaeus at the dawn of the zoological nomenclature.

Members of the genus first appeared in the fossil record during the Miocene.

Well-known species include &quot;Helix pomatia&quot; (Roman snail, Burgundy snail, or edible snail) and &quot;Helix lucorum&quot; (Turkish snail). &quot;Cornu aspersum&quot; (garden snail), though externally similar and long classified as a member of &quot;Helix&quot; (as &quot;Helix aspersa&quot;), is not closely related to &quot;Helix&quot; and belongs to a different tribe of Helicinae.

==Taxonomy==

In Linnaeus&#x27; 10th edition of Systema Naturae, which marks the beginning of the zoological nomenclature, the generic name &quot;Helix&quot; had been used for a variety of terrestrial (e.g. &quot;Zonites algirus&quot;), freshwater (e.g. &quot;Lymnaea stagnalis&quot;), and marine (e.g. &quot;Fossarus ambiguus&quot;) gastropods. Later authors restricted the name&#x27;s use to stylommatophoran species with flattened to globular shells, including zonitids and other groups. In the course of the 1800s, several thousand species of Europe and abroad have been described in &quot;Helix&quot;. By the early 1900s, the genus was split into many separate genera, leaving only species closely related to its type species &quot;Helix pomatia&quot; in the genus. However, due to the previously broad concept of the genus, &quot;Helix&quot; is part of the original combination (basionym) of many gastropod names and there still are many nominal taxa described in &quot;Helix&quot; whose generic placement remains unresolved (taxa inquirenda), although they clearly do not refer to any species of &quot;Helix&quot; in its present sense.

Since the 2000s, &quot;Helix&quot; has been subject to extensive molecular phylogenetic studies and taxonomic revisions. These led to the exclusion of several species, most notably the garden snail, and inclusion of others (&quot;H. ceratina&quot;, &quot;H. nicaeensis&quot;). &quot;Maltzanella&quot;, for long considered a subgenus of &quot;Helix&quot;, was also formally removed from the genus, but is the sister group of &quot;Helix&quot;.

Two subgenera are currently recognized:

*&quot;Helix (Helix)&quot; 
*&quot;Helix (Pelasga)&quot; 
*&quot;Helix&quot; (&quot;Aegaeohelix&quot;) 

== Description ==
&quot;Helix&quot; comprises large land snails species, with shell diameter of 2–6 cm. The shell is globular to conical, with five darker bands that may be variably reduced or fuse together. The globular shell distinguishes &quot;Helix&quot; from most of the related genera (tribe Helicini), except for &quot;Maltzanella&quot; and &quot;Lindholmia&quot;. The surface has a structure of fine transversal ribs, developed to a varying degree, and there may be very fine spiral grooves as well. The shell is never malleated. Colour of the foot varies. It may be grey, brown, black or pink; the back of the foot is dark in several species.

The shells of &quot;Helix&quot; species are dextral. Sinistral individuals are very rare, but are occasionally found (e.g. &quot;H. pomatia&quot;, &quot;H. thessalica&quot; and &quot;H. lutescens&quot;).

Characters on the genital system have been used to define the genus and its subgenera. Unlike &quot;Cornu&quot;, the penis of &quot;Helix&quot; contains two papillae with a central opening. There appears to be a tendency for a shortening of the diverticulum of bursa copulatrix and of the eppiphallus, but there is an overlap with related genera in these characters. Mucous glands adjoining the dart sac are usually richly branched.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Helix&quot; is a western Palaearctic genus. The species diversity is concentrated to the Balkans and Anatolia, with the greatest phylogenetic diversity in Greece. The natural western distribution limits run through mainland France (&quot;Helix pomatia&quot;), Corsica (&quot;Helix ceratina&quot;), and Algeria (&quot;Helix melanostoma&quot;). In the north, the natural distribution of &quot;H. pomatia&quot; reaches central Germany and the southern margins of the North European plain. The southernmost species live in North Africa (&quot;H. melanostoma&quot;, &quot;H. pronuba&quot;) and the southern Levant (&quot;H. engaddensis&quot;). The eastern limits are reached in western Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan (&quot;H. salomonica&quot;) and in the Caucasus (&quot;H. lucorum&quot;); &quot;H. thessalica&quot; reaches through Ukraine at least to the western Russian frontier.

==Genetics==
Haploid genome size was estimated to be nearly 4 Gbp (C-value 4 pg) with a GC-content of ~42%, but it is unclear which species was studied due to a discrepancy between the stated species and sample origin. The haploid number of chromosomes is 27 (studied species were &quot;H. lucorum&quot;, &quot;H. buchii&quot;, &quot;H. pomatia&quot;, &quot;H. gussoneana&quot; and &quot;H. straminea&quot;). In &quot;H. pomatia&quot;, all chromosomes have median or sub-median centromeres. Small supernumerary chromosomes were reported from &quot;H. pomatia&quot; from England.

The mitochondrial genome of &quot;H. pomatia&quot; is available (ca. 14 070 bp long).

== Genital system ==

The structure of the genital system corresponds in most aspects to that of other Helicidae. Its anatomy and function have been studied in detail in &quot;H. pomatia&quot;.

As all stylommatophorans, &quot;Helix&quot; snails are hermaphrodites. Sperms and egg cells are produced in a common gonad, the ovotestis (hermaphroditic gland), which is embedded in the hepatopancreas (digestive gland) near the apex of the shell. Gametes are transported through a hermaphroditic duct (ovotestis duct) to the fertilization pouch–spermatheca complex (carrefour) embedded at the base of the albumen gland. In this organ, the foreign sperm (sperm from the other individual) is stored in spermathecal sacs (receptacula seminis) and egg fertilization takes place in the fertilisation pouch. The albumen gland provides nourishment for the developing fertilized eggs, and its size greatly varies with the stage of the reproductive cycle. The snail&#x27;s own sperm and fertilized eggs are transported by specialised regions of the spermoviduct (sperm groove and uterus), which distally separate into a male (vas deferens) and female (free oviduct) parts of the genital system.

The male genitalia consist of a tube that serves the formation of a spermatophore and its transfer into the female parts of the mating partner. The penis is the most distal and muscular part. A spermatophore is formed in the epiphallus (between vas deferens and penis) and the flagellum (continuation of the epiphallus proximally from the vas deferens opening); the latter forms the tail of the spermatophore. During copulation, the penis everts (like a sleeve turned inside out) and is in this process inserted in the vagina. A retractor muscle attaches on the epiphallus and retracts the male genitalia after copulation.

The female part consists of a vagina (sometimes called the copulatory canal) and the bursa copulatrix (gametolytic gland) with its stalk and usually a diverticulum of the stalk. The vagina serves the transport of the foreign spermatophore and of eggs. The bursa is attached by a thin stalk to the vagina (marking the boundary between vagina and the free oviduct). The stalk in most cases bears a diverticulum, a blind tube that receives the front part of the spermatophore if present. The diverticulum has been proposed to be a remnant of a seminal duct that originally transported foreign sperm into the fertilization pouch. Sperm leave the tail of the spermatophore and migrate into the oviduct and then to the fertilization pouch; the vast majority of the sperm does not escape in this way and is digested in the bursa. In &quot;Helix&quot;, there is tendency for a reduction of the diverticulum, and it can be missing in several species.

Dart apparatus, although positioned on the vagina, is functionally also part of the male genitalia. It is composed of a single muscular dart sac and two mucous glands (digitiform or accessory glands) on its sides. The mucous glands are branched at their base; the number of branches varies between &quot;Helix&quot; species. The single dart is aragonitic, straight or only weakly curved, with four blades (vanes) along its length and a corona at its base. The dart apparatus is missing in &quot;Helix salomonica&quot;. The mucous glands produce mucus that covers the dart during shooting and is thereby injected into the body of the partner, where it induces shortening of the diverticulum and peristaltic movements of the bursa stalk that help the foreign sperm to escape lysis in the bursa.

The whole genital system forms from a single tubular invagination of the ectoderm. During the development, folds form along the internal space of the tube than eventually completely separte first vas deferens and penis, then also bursa copulatrix. The male and female parts open into a common atrium and a genital pore positioned ventrally behind the right optic tentacle.

A rare teratological individual with paired male genitalia (penis, epiphallus, flagellum) has been reported from Germany.

== Reproduction ==

The aspects of reproduction have been studied primarily in &quot;H. pomatia&quot;, with limited information from other species.

Mating behaviour has been described several times for &quot;H. pomatia&quot;. In the initial phase, the two snails raise their feet and press the soles against each other and touch each other&#x27;s tentacles and mouthparts. This takes 15–30 min. Some time later, the dart shooting takes place, although many matings progress without a love dart being employed. The mucous glands produce a whitish secretion just before the shooting, that contains hormones promoting the compound that improves preservation of foreign sperm in the receiving individual. Then, again after a pause, comes the copulation, usually preceded by several unsuccessful attempts in which the reciprocal insertion of penes is not achieved and the genital organs are partially retracted back into the body. Finally, both individuals simultaneously insert the penes into each other&#x27;s female opening. Within ca. 4–7 min the spermatophore is formed and transferred, after which the snail disengage and retract the everted genital organs. However, the complete reception of the spermatophore takes another 2–3 hours, during which the snails remain partially retracted and inactive.

It has been reported that only one spermatophore is usually transferred during copulation in &quot;H. pomatia&quot;, so one animal functions as a male and one as a female in each mating. According to that report it is mostly the older snail who lay eggs, while younger function as males.

In &quot;H. pomatia&quot;, mating takes place mostly from May to June, but often continues more sporadically up to the autumn. However, because activity is dependent on climatic conditions, the timing of mating and egg laying differs in some other species.

In &quot;H. pomatia&quot;, the snails copulate usually with multiple mates. Received foreign sperm may be stored for more than a year before fertilization. Eggs are laid into a chamber dug in the soil by the parent 4–6 days after mating. The eggs are formed only as the nest is built. As in other pulmonates, the eggs are rich in galactogen produced by the albumen gland. The eggshell is partially mineralized, with crystals of calcium cabonate in a flexible membrane. Clutch size is given in the literature within the range 3–93. Hatching follows roughly 25–26 (range 18–31) days after egg laying, but the snails remain additional 8–10 days in the nest. An individual may lay more than one clutch per season. The clutch size may be different in other species. Mean clutch size in &quot;H. lucorum&quot; is similar to that of &quot;H. pomatia&quot;, while the range reported for &quot;H. albescens&quot; (smaller body size than &quot;H. pomatia&quot;, with larger eggs) is only 7–22 eggs per clutch.

The sperm morphology follows the basic pattern known from &quot;pulmonates&quot;. Mitochondria are fused and form a continuous sheath around the flagellum. Large part of mitochondrial derivative is made up by a proteinaceous paracrystalline structure, in which there is a glycogen-filled canal. The canal runs helically along the flagellum, forming a so-called glycogen helix. There is only a single, loosely coiled glycogen helix in &quot;Helix&quot;.

==Life history==
In &quot;H. pomatia&quot;, sexual maturity is reached after 2–4 (–6) overwinterings, i.e. at the age of 2–4 (–6) years, but this differs between localities as well as between snails from the same clutch. Adult snails cease to grow and form a thickened lip around the aperture. However, the snails sometimes mate already shortly before the lip is formed. The life span of &quot;H. pomatia&quot; may reach 30 years in the wild. However, in the wild, they mostly live for just 5–9 years. The age of &quot;H. pomatia&quot; individuals can be estimated by counting growth interruptions on the shell and the number of layers deposited on the aperture margin lip. 

Data from other species are very limited. &quot;Helix lucorum&quot; in Greece reaches maturity at 3 years. The small species &quot;H. ceratina&quot; reaches maturity after 1.5–2 years and lives 4–5 years.

The length of the life cycle is dependent on environmental conditions. The time from hatching to first egg laying can be shortened in &quot;H. pomatia&quot; to just 12–13 months under optimal conditions in the captivity, mainly by skipping hibernation.

== Ecology and behaviour ==
Species of &quot;Helix&quot; live in a variety of habitats and under very different climatic regimes. Some species are exclusively found in open limestone rocky habitats (&quot;H. secernenda&quot;), while others tolerate acidic bedrock (e.g. &quot;H. pelagonesica&quot;) or live predominantly in forests (e.g. &quot;H. thessalica&quot;). Members of the genus occur from temperate rainforests (&quot;H. buchii&quot;) to semi-arid regions (&quot;Helix pronuba&quot;).

Food preferences are unknown for most species. &quot;Helix pomatia&quot; feeds on live plants as well as dead plant matter. Observations showed preference for some specific plant species and avoidance of others. The nettle &quot;Urtica dioica&quot; is a preferred food plant especially in juveniles. In a &quot;H. nucula&quot; from northern Israel, adults were found to mainly feed on dead, decaying plant matter early during their activity season, while later on they feed on fresh plants along with the newly hatched juveniles.

The activity of &quot;H. pomatia&quot; takes place mostly during the night, especially in juveniles. Even during favourable conditions, less than a half of the population at given site is active at the same time. A homing behaviour has been observed in &quot;H. pomatia.&quot; The snails disperse during the season, but tend to return to their hibernation grounds towards its end. During the season, they may have an area where they reside and from where they make excursions to known feeding areas and, if needed, attempts to locate new ones. It was also observed that the snails may migrate to specific sites for egg laying and aggregate for mating. The snails are able to find their way back from distances of tens of meters. Active dispersal during the lifetime may lead to displacement by more than 200 m.

Several species (e.g. &quot;H. pomatia&quot;, &quot;H. salomonica&quot;) build a thick, calcified epiphragm that closes the shell&#x27;s aperture during hibernation or aestivation. The epiphragm is followed inside the shell by a few additional membranes made of dried mucus. When the animal emerges from the dormancy, it discards the calcareous epiphragm using the posterior part of the foot. &quot;Helix lucorum&quot; may have up to three calcareous epiphragms, but they are much thinner than in &quot;H. pomatia&quot;. The hibernation and aestivation takes place in the soil, where the snails bury themselves with the foot. &quot;Helix&quot; species differ in where they spend shorter periods of inactivity: some tend to remain on the soil surface, some hide in the soil (in particular species of the subgenus &quot;Pelasga&quot;), and some species often climb on vegetation (tree trunks, shrubs).

The hibernation or aestivation may take a substantial part of the year. For example, &quot;H. salomonica&quot; in Şırnak, Turkey, spent on average 85 days in hibernation and 165 days in aestivation during one year of observation. Also the period of activity of &quot;H. nucula&quot; may be only 4 months a year. In a study on &quot;H. lucorum&quot; from northern Greece, dormancy of the snails was induced mainly by low humidity. In &quot;H. pomatia&quot;, hibernation is induced by temperature and humidity, but there is also an influence of photoperiod.

== Biotic interactions ==

=== Predators and parasites ===
Several bird species prey on &quot;Helix&quot; species. This has been observed in &quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;, &quot;Burhinus oedicemus&quot;, &quot;Coracias garrulus&quot;, &quot;Lanius excubitor&quot;, corvids, and probably other birds. Mammals prey on &quot;Helix&quot;, too. The known predators include hedgehog, mole, shrew, rodents (&quot;Rattus&quot;, &quot;Apodemus&quot;) and the wild boar. The slow worm consumes molluscs, including &quot;Helix&quot;. &quot;Helix&quot; snails are also attacked by various beetles and flies. The beetle predators belong to the families Carabidae and Lampyridae. The predation by birds, small mammals, and beetles mostly affects juveniles. Larvae of flies from several families attack &quot;Helix&quot; snails and may kill even adults (Phoridae, Muscidae, Sarcophagidae, Sciomyzidae).

A well known facultative parasite of land snails, including &quot;Helix&quot;, is the nematode &quot;Phasmarhabiditis hermaphrodita&quot;. The parasitic mite &quot;Riccardoella limacum&quot; is found on &quot;Helix&quot; species.

The kinetoplastid &quot;Cryptobia helicis&quot; lives in the bursa copulatrix of &quot;Helix pomatia&quot;. The ciliate &quot;Tetrahymena limacis&quot; was also reported from &quot;Helix&quot;.

Bacterial diseases of gastropods including &quot;Helix&quot; are known, but this field is not well researched.

=== Influence on other species and the environment ===
Some bee species build their nests inside empty &quot;Helix&quot; shells (e.g. &quot;Rhodanthidium semptemdentatum&quot;).

== Human use ==

Some species, above all &quot;H. pomatia&quot; and &quot;H. lucorum&quot;, are collected for human consumption. The culinary use dates back several millennia and has been evidenced for several species across the genus&#x27; range. 

Mesolithic shell midden dated to 9370 ± 80 and 8110 ± 90 uncalibrated C-14 years bp and providing evidence of collecting was documented for &quot;H. pomatella&quot; in Abruzzo, Italy. &quot;Helix salomonica&quot; was consumed in the Zagros in large amount during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, with evidence of consumption from ~12,000 BC. In North Africa, shell middens from the Caspian culture containing large amounts of &quot;H. melanostoma&quot; were found.

Ancient Romans collected snails for food and even held them in enclosures, as described by Marcus Terentius Varro (in De Re Rustica, and repeated by Pliny the Elder). It is believed that the Roman snail &quot;H. pomatia&quot; was introduced to England by the Romans.

== Conservation ==
Most of the species included in the IUCN Red List are classified as Least Concern. One of the species, &quot;H. ceratina&quot;, is critically endangered and the present known distribution is limited to a very small area near the Ajaccio airport.

In the past, collection of wild &quot;H. pomatia&quot; for food led to fears of over-exploitation and the introduction of protection by law in several countries.

==List of extant species==
== Fossil record ==
Several extinct taxa of &quot;Helix&quot; have been described:
*&quot;Helix jasonis&quot; 
*&quot;Helix pseudoligata&quot; 
*&quot;Helix kadolskyi&quot; (nom. nov. for &quot;Helix toulai&quot; ) 
*&quot;Helix barbeyana&quot; 
*&quot;Helix krejcii&quot; 
*&quot;Helix mrazeci&quot; 
*&quot;Helix sublutescens&quot; 
*&quot;Helix maeotica&quot; 
*&quot;Helix varnensis&quot; 
*&quot;Helix lucorum supralevantina&quot; 
Some extant species are known from Quaternary deposits. The most studied species in this respect is &quot;H. pomatia&quot;, where the fossils have been used to document the earliest postglacial occurrences in Central Europe. The earliest record in Czechia was dated directly by radiocarbon to 10,120-9,690 BP (but is likely a few hundred years younger); fossils presumably older than 9,402–9,027 BP or 9,403–9,003 BP were found in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Such records document the speed at which &quot;Helix&quot; species may extends their ranges by natural means of dispersal.

The quaternary land snail fossil record in more southern parts of Europe is scarce, but some records of &quot;Helix&quot; do exist. &quot;Helix figulina&quot; dated ~16,000 BP was recorded from the Greek island Antikythera. &quot;Helix borealis&quot; shells dated to 8,000–27,000 BP were reported from another island, Gavdos.

Other records come from archaeological contexts.

<doc id="378789" wikidata="Q141569" url="?curid=378789" title="Stenolaemata">
<text>Stenolaemata are a class of exclusively marine bryozoans. Stenolaemates originated and diversified in the Ordovician, and more than 600 species are still alive today. All extant (living) species are in the order Cyclostomatida, the third-largest order of living bryozoans.

These animals are stationary suspension feeders that live on the ocean floor. They formed colonies with robust, calcified exoskeletons, allowing for a high potential for fossil preservation. The individual zooids in the colony may be tubular, conical, or sac-shaped. Each individual, or zooid, may extend from the colony at an angle, extending its tentacles to feed. The fossil genus &quot;Batostoma&quot; in the order Trepostomatida existed in monticular colonies.

Stenolaemates were the predominant bryozoan group during the Paleozoic, when many extinct orders proliferated within the class. Some grew as lacy or fan-like colonies that became important reef builders, and in some regions form an abundant component of limestones. The extinct Palaeozoic stenolaemate orders are placed in the superorder Palaeostomata. Their numbers were greatly reduced during the terminal Permian extinction event, and most stenolaemates were extinct by the start of the Jurassic.

However, the basal and previously rare stenolaemate order Cyclostomatida diversified in the Jurassic and became the most abundant group of bryozoans in the late Mesozoic. Cyclostomatida is no longer the most speciose bryozoan group, as the order experienced high rates of extinction during the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, while ctenostome and cheilostome bryozoans in the class Gymnolaemata diversified around the same time. Nevertheless, cyclostomates are still major components of modern marine ecosystems.

Extant and extinct orders in this class include:
* Cyclostomatida/Cyclostomata (Ordovician-present)
* Cryptostomata/Cryptostomida † (Ordovician-Triassic)
* Cystoporida/Cystoporata † (Ordovician-Triassic)
* Esthonioporata † (Ordovician-Devonian)
* Fenestrata/Fenestrida † (Ordovician-Permian)
* Timanodictyina † (Devonian-Permian, may be a suborder of Cryptostomata)
* Trepostomatida/Trepostomata † (Ordovician-Triassic)

<text>The Judicial Yuan () is the judicial branch of the Republic of China. It functions as the Constitutional Court and oversees the courts of Taiwan, including the ordinary courts such as the Supreme Court, high courts, and district courts as well as special courts like administrative, and disciplinary courts. The Judicial Yuan holds the following powers:
* &quot;Interpretation&quot; – Acting as the Constitutional Court to interpret the Constitution and other statutes and regulations made by the central or local government.
* &quot;Adjudication&quot; – Most civil, criminal, and administrative cases are adjudicated by the respective courts supervised by the Judicial Yuan. The Constitutional Court adjudicate presidential impeachment and political party dissolution cases.
* &quot;Discipline&quot; – Disciplinary measures with respect to public functionaries are adjudicated by the Disciplinary court.
* &quot;Judicial Administration&quot; – The Judicial Yuan supervises administrative affairs of all courts established by Taiwanese law.

According to the current Constitution, the Constitutional Court consists of fifteen justices. One justice acts as the president of the court, and another acts as the vice president. All justices, including the president and vice president, are appointed by the president of the Republic with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. Upon appointment justices have a term limit of eight years, but this term limit does not apply to the president and vice president.

==Constitutional Court==
===History===
Before the 1980s, the impact of the Constitutional Court was limited by authoritarian governance. The Court could be seen as an instrument of the Kuomintang regime. It never accepted a case on the constitutionality of the Temporary Provisions, which were the basis of authoritarian rule; The Court declined to hear challenges to these Provisions, and issued a number of decisions that facilitated Kuomintang rule within the confines of at least nominal constitutionalism. For the most part, the court served as a legal advisor to the government, rendering decisions that unified interpretations of statutes or ordinances or providing legitimacy for these politically expedient solutions as a result of extension of legislative representatives&#x27; terms. In Interpretation No 31 of 1954, the court extended the legislative representatives&#x27; terms, ruling that &#x27;the nation was under crisis and the country could not hold the election for the second term legally&#x27;. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Constitutional Court further affirmed the constitutionality of adding extra seats to both the Legislative Yuan and the National Assembly by means of legislative enactments in Interpretation Nos 117 and 150.

Prior to the 1980s, the Constitutional Court rarely asserted itself as the guardian of the Constitution; on rare occasions, however, the court nevertheless risked undermining its own institutional authority by standing in opposition to other branches of government. In Interpretation No 86 of 1960, the court held that the law that allowed the Ministry of Justice to supervise the lower courts was inconsistent with the constitution and required all courts to be placed under the Judicial Yuan. However, this decision was ignored by the government, and the impugned law was not revised until 1980.

After the succession of Lee Teng-hui as president in 1987, however, the Court gradually became more active. It began to strike administrative actions that were vague or delegated too much power to the executive branch. Amongst its decisions, the Court ended the ban on rallies advocating secessionism or communism as a violation of free speech, allowed universities to refuse to allow military &quot;counselors&quot;, whose presence in dorms had formerly been mandatory, and allowed teachers to form a union outside the &quot;official&quot; union structure. Constitutional amendments in 1992 provided for the Court to hear challenges against &quot;unconstitutional&quot; political parties, defined as those whose &quot;goals or activities jeopardize the existence of the ROC or a free democratic constitutional order.&quot;

Amidst the divided government between 2000 and 2008, the Constitutional Court became a primary political mediator of highly charged political disputes; it adopted a &#x27;dialectic approach&#x27; in facilitation of political dialogues. For example, in a constitutional dispute concerning the suspension of the construction of a nuclear power plant, the Court held that the Democratic Progressive Party-led Executive Yuan should negotiate with the Kuomintang-dominated Legislative Yuan to resolve the issue. The unity of the executive and legislative branches since 2008 has seen a decline in the number of politically high-profile cases entering into the Constitutional Court&#x27;s docket. At the same time, the number of individuals&#x27; petitions challenging legislative or executive acts on grounds of violation of constitutional rights continued to rise steadily, and the Constitutional Court has responded to these rights challenges with a high number of declarations of unconstitutionality.

===Functions===

The Constitutional Court (), also previously known as the Council of Grand Justices (), provides rulings on the following six categories of cases: 
# Constitutionality of laws and constitutional complaints (Chapter III cases);
# Disputes between constitutional organs (Chapter IV cases);
# Impeachment of the President and the Vice President (Chapter V cases);
# Dissolution of unconstitutional political parties (Chapter VI cases);
# Local self-government (Chapter VII cases); and
# Uniform interpretation of statutes and regulations (Chapter VIII cases).

A petition to declare regulations or laws unconstitutional (Chapter III cases) shall be filed in the following circumstances:
* A highest state organ which, in the exercise of its powers or on account of its subordinate agency&#x27;s exercise of powers, considers that the applicable law is in contravention of the Constitution may lodge a petition with the Constitutional Court for a judgment declaring the impugned law unconstitutional. A subordinate agency which, in the exercise of its powers, considers that the applicable law is in contravention of the Constitution may request its superior agency to lodge the petition;
* A quarter or more of the incumbent Legislators who, in the exercise of their powers, believe that the relevant statutory law is in contravention of the Constitution may lodge a petition with the Constitutional Court for a judgment declaring the impugned statutory law unconstitutional;
* A court which strongly believes, on reasonable grounds, that an applicable statutory law on whose validity depends the court&#x27;s decision of a pending case is in contravention of the Constitution may lodge a petition with the Constitutional Court for a judgment declaring the impugned applicable law unconstitutional; or
* After exhaustion of all ordinary judicial remedies, any person who believes that a final court decision that finds against her or him or a legal provision applied in such a court decision contravenes the Constitution may lodge a petition with the Constitutional Court for a judgment declaring the decision or the impugned legal provision unconstitutional.

===Justices===
There are in total of 15 justices () serving in the Constitutional Court, current members include:
===Important decisions===
Important decisions of the Constitutional Court are listed as the following.

====Interpretations made before the Constitutional Court Procedure Act====
=====Interpretation No. 31=====
In 1954, the Council of Grand Justices extended the terms of members of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan elected in 1948, ruling that:
As a result of the council&#x27;s ruling, first-term members of the Legislative and Control Yuans continued to serve for the next four decades until 1992, resulting in distortions of representation. Following the death of some of those representatives, the Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion were amended to allow vacancies to be filled by holding supplementary elections or by adding more seats for representatives elected locally in Taiwan.

=====Interpretation No. 261=====
The Council of Grand Justices issued interpretation No. 261 on June 21, 1990. The Council of Grand Justices ruled on the constitutionality of the continued sitting in the National Assembly of members elected on the mainland in 1948 and ordered that: 
The court further required the government to hold a nationwide second-term election of the national representatives including a certain number of representatives-at-large for the proper functioning of the constitutional system.
=====Interpretation No. 499=====
The Constitutional Court, in voiding the 5th amendment of the &quot;Additional Articles of the Constitution&quot;, developed criteria by which the constitutionality of a constitutional amendment should be judged:
* a constitutional amendment must be enacted in accordance with constitutional due process; and
* since a constitutional amendment is enacted on the basis of powers bestowed by the constitution, it cannot alter ‘the existing constitutional provisions of essential significance, such as the principle of the democratic republic, the principle of sovereignty of and by the people, the core contents of fundamental rights of people, and the principle of checks and balances of governmental powers.’

====Judgements made after the Constitutional Court Procedure Act====
== Ordinary courts ==
=== Supreme court ===
The Supreme Court () is the court of last resort for civil and criminal cases. A civil case can be appealed to the Supreme Court only when more than NT $1,500,000 is at stake. Except for petty offences enumerated in Article 376 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, any criminal case may be appealed to the Court.

This Court exercises jurisdiction over the following cases:
*appeals from judgments of High Courts or their branches as courts of first instance in criminal cases;
*appeals from judgments of High Courts or their branches as courts of second instance in civil and criminal cases;
*appeals from rulings of High Courts or their branches;
*appeals from judgments or rulings rendered by the civil court of second instance by the summary procedure, the amounts in controversy exceeding NT $1,500,000, and with permission granted in accordance with specified provisions;
*civil and criminal retrials within the jurisdiction of the court of third instance;
*extraordinary appeals; or
*any other case as specified by laws.

=== High court ===
There are six high courts () branches in Taiwan:
The High Courts and its branches exercise jurisdiction over the following cases:
* Appeals from judgments of the District Courts or their branches as courts of the first instance in ordinary proceedings of civil and criminal cases;
* Interlocutory appeals from rulings of the District Courts or their branches in ordinary proceedings;
* First instance criminal cases relating to rebellion, treason, and offenses against friendly relations with foreign states;
* Military appellate cases whose judgments are imprisonment for a definite period rendered by the High Military Courts and their branches; and
* Other cases prescribed by law.

The high courts and its branch courts are divided into civil, criminal and specialized divisions. Each division is composed of one division chief judge and two associate judges. Additionally, the high courts and its branch courts have a clerical bureau, which is headed by a chief clerk who assists the president with administrative affairs.

Cases before the high courts or its branch courts are heard and decided by a panel of three judges. However, one of the judges may conduct preparatory proceedings.

The Court has seven civil courts, each of which has one presiding judge and three judges to handle civil appeals of the second instance and counter-appeal cases under the system of collegial panels, but they do not deal with simple litigation. The Court has eleven criminal courts, each of which has one presiding judge and two or three judges to handle criminal appeals of the second instance and counter-appeal cases under the system of collegial panels as well as litigation of the first instance concerning civil strife, foreign aggression or violation of foreign relations. Based on various needs, the Court manages several professional courts such as the Professional Court of Fair Trade Cases, Family Professional Court, Professional Court of International Trade, Maritime Professional Court, Professional Court of State Compensation, Professional Court of Anti-corruption, Professional Court of Intellectual Property Rights, Professional Court of Juvenile Delinquency, Professional Court of Serious Criminal Cases, Professional Court of Public Security, Professional Court of Fair Trade Act, Professional Court of Sexual Harassment, etc.

=== District court ===
There are currently 22 district courts () in Taiwan:

Each district court may establish one or more summary divisions for the adjudication of cases suitable for summary judgment. The civil summary procedure is for cases involving an amount in controversy of not more than 300,000 New Taiwan dollar and for simple legal disputes. Currently there are a total of 45 divisions in Taiwan. Additionally, there is a Taiwan Kaohsiung Juvenile Court, established in accordance with the Law Governing the Disposition of Juvenile Cases.

Each of the district courts have civil, criminal and summary divisions and may establish specialized divisions to handle cases involving juveniles, family, traffic, and labor matters as well as motions to set aside rulings on violations of the Statute for the Maintenance of Social Order. Each division has a Division who supervises and assigns the business of the division. Each district court has a public defender’s office and a probation officer’s office.

A single judge hears and decides cases in ordinary and summary proceedings as well as in small claims cases. A panel of three judges decides cases of great importance in ordinary proceedings as well as appeals or interlocutory appeals from the summary and small claims proceedings. Criminal cases are decided by a panel of three judges, with the exception of summary proceedings which may be held by a single judge. The Juvenile Court hears and decides only cases involving juveniles.

==Special courts==
===Administrative court===
The administrative courts () handle cases regarding administrative litigation. The current administrative litigation system adopts a &quot;Two Level Two Instance System&quot; litigation procedure. The administrative courts are classified into the High Administrative Court, which is the court of first instance, and the Supreme Administrative Court, which is the appellate court. The first instance of the High Administrative Court is a trial of facts. The Supreme Administrative Court is an appellate court.
===Intellectual Property and Commercial Court===
The Intellectual Property and Commercial Court () handles cases regarding intellectual properties and commerce.

===Disciplinary court===
The disciplinary court () maintains official discipline and punishes public servants, regardless of rank or appointment, for violations of the law or negligence in his or her duty in accordance with Article 77 of the Constitution.

== Judges ==
Article 80 of the Constitution states that Judges shall be above partisanship and shall, in accordance with law, hold trials independently, free from any interference. Furthermore, Article 81 states that Judges shall hold office for life. No judge shall be removed from office unless he has been guilty of a criminal offense or subjected to disciplinary measure, or declared to be under interdiction. No judge shall, except in accordance with law, be suspended or transferred or have his salary reduced. Judges shall be appointed from those persons who have passed the Examination of Judicial Officials, completed the Training Course for Judicial Officials and possessed distinguished records after a term of practice.

==President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan ==
Since a constitutional amendment ratified in 1997, the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan need to be justices. However, they are not subject to the 8-year term limit like the other 13 justices. In the current constitution, the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan are appointed by the President of the Republic with the approval of the Legislative Yuan.

<text>Mastercard Inc., stylized as MasterCard from 1979 to 2016 and as mastercard from 2016 to 2019, is an American multinational payment card services corporation headquartered in Purchase, New York. It offers a range of payment transaction processing and other related-payment services (such as travel-related payments and bookings). Throughout the world, its principal business is to process payments between the banks of merchants and the card-issuing banks or credit unions of the purchasers who use the Mastercard-brand debit, credit and prepaid cards to make purchases. Mastercard has been publicly traded since 2006.

Mastercard (originally Interbank, then Master Charge) was created by an alliance of several banks and regional bankcard associations in response to the BankAmericard issued by Bank of America, which later became Visa and is still its biggest competitor. Prior to its initial public offering, Mastercard Worldwide was a cooperative owned by the more than 25,000 financial institutions that issue its branded cards.

==History==

Although BankAmericard&#x27;s debut in September 1958 was a disaster, it began to turn a profit by May 1961. Bank of America deliberately kept this information secret and allowed then-widespread negative impressions to linger in order to ward off competition. This strategy was successful until 1966, when BankAmericard&#x27;s profitability had become far too big to hide. From 1960 to 1966, there were only 10 new credit cards introduced in the United States, but from 1966 to 1968, approximately 440 credit cards were introduced by banks large and small throughout the country. These newcomers promptly banded together into regional bankcard associations.

One reason why most banks chose to join forces was that at the time, 16 states limited the ability of banks to operate through branch locations, while 15 states entirely prohibited branch banking and required unit banking. A unit bank can legally operate only at a single site and is thereby forced to remain very small. By joining a regional bankcard association, a unit bank could quickly add a credit card to its lineup of financial products, and achieve economies of scale by outsourcing tedious back office tasks like card servicing to the association. Such associations also enabled unit banks to aggregate their customer bases and merchant networks in order to make a credit card useful for both customers and merchants; early credit cards had failed because they could only be used within a small radius around their respective issuing banks.

In 1966, Karl H. Hinke, an executive vice president at Marine Midland Bank, asked representatives of several other banks to meet him in Buffalo, New York. Marine Midland had just launched its own regional bankcard in the Upstate New York market after Bank of America declined its request for a BankAmericard regional license on the basis that Marine Midland was too big. The result of the Buffalo meeting was that several banks and regional bankcard associations soon agreed to join forces as Interbankard, Inc., which then became the Interbank Card Association (ICA). By the end of 1967, ICA had 150 members and Hinke became ICA&#x27;s chairman. Bank of America eventually joined Mastercard as well. (In the 21st century, Bank of America would revive the BankAmericard brand name as a Mastercard credit card, which it remains today).

The Interbank branding in 1966 initially consisted only of a small unobtrusive lowercase &quot;i&quot; inside a circle in the lower right-hand corner of the front of each Interbank card; the rest of the card design was the prerogative of each issuing bank. This tiny logo proved to be entirely unsatisfactory for creating nationwide brand awareness in order to compete against the established leader, BankAmericard. In 1969, Interbank developed a new national brand, &quot;Master Charge: The Interbank Card&quot; by combining the two overlapping yellow and orange circles of the Western States Bankcard Association with the &quot;Master Charge&quot; name coined by the First National Bank of Louisville, Kentucky.

That same year, First National City Bank joined Interbank and merged its proprietary Everything Card with Master Charge.

In 1968, the ICA and Eurocard started a strategic alliance, which effectively allowed the ICA access to the European market, and for Eurocard to be accepted on the ICA network. The Access card system from the United Kingdom joined the ICA/Eurocard alliance in 1972.

In 1979, &quot;Master Charge: The Interbank Card&quot; was renamed &quot;MasterCard&quot;.

In 1983, Mastercard International Inc. became the first bank to use holograms as part of their card security. They acquired the Cirrus network of automated tellers in 1985.

In 1997, Mastercard took over the Access card; the Access brand was then retired. In 2002, MasterCard International merged with Europay International, another large credit-card issuer association, of which Eurocard had become a part in 1992. Mastercard became a Delaware corporation in connection with the merger, as well as in anticipation of an IPO.

The company, which had been organized as a cooperative of banks, had an initial public offering on May 25, 2006, selling 95.5 million shares at $39 each. The stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol MA, with a market capitalization of $434 billion as of April 2024. The deal was designed to maintain the value of the brand and minimise regulatory costs.

In August 2010, Mastercard Worldwide, as it had been rebranded, expanded its e-commerce offering with the acquisition of DataCash, a UK-based payment processing and fraud/risk management provider. In March 2012, Mastercard announced the expansion of its mobile contactless payments program, including markets across the Middle East.

In spring 2014, Mastercard acquired Australia&#x27;s leading rewards program manager company Pinpoint for an undisclosed amount. In August 2017, Mastercard acquired Brighterion, a company with a portfolio of intellectual property in the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Brighterion holds several patents.

In April 2021, Mastercard created a calculator that gathers information and measures the carbon footprints of the customers in order to help them know how much they are contributing in carbon emissions and global warming.

In March 2022, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Mastercard announced that it would suspend all business operations in Russia.

On November 17, 2023, the Chinese government approved the local bank card clearing license for the joint venture established by Mastercard in China. As of May 9, 2024, the joint venture can issue Mastercard bank cards that use the Chinese yuan for payment.

In September 2024, Mastercard acquired cybersecurity company Recorded Future for $2.65 billion.

=== Finances ===

As of 2024, Mastercard ranked 164 on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.

== Market power ==
Operating a payment processing network entails risk of engaging in anticompetitive practices due to the many parties involved (that is, the customer and their bank and the merchant and their bank).

Few companies have faced more antitrust lawsuits both in the US and abroad.

===United States===
Mastercard, along with Visa, engaged in systematic parallel exclusion against American Express during the 1980s and 1990s. Mastercard used exclusivity clauses in its contracts and blacklists to prevent banks from doing business with American Express. Such exclusionary clauses and other written evidence were used by the United States Department of Justice in regulatory actions against Mastercard and Visa. Discover has sued Mastercard for similar issues.

Both Mastercard and Visa have paid approximately $3 billion in damages resulting from a class-action lawsuit filed in January 1996 for debit card swipe fee price fixing. The litigation cites several retail giants as plaintiffs, including Wal-Mart, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., and Safeway.

In 1996, four million merchants sued Mastercard in federal court for making them accept debit cards if they wanted to accept credit cards and dramatically increasing credit card swipe fees. This case was settled with a multibillion-dollar payment in 2003. This was the largest antitrust award in history.

In 1998, the Department of Justice sued Mastercard over rules prohibiting their issuing banks from doing business with American Express or Discover. The Department of Justice won in 2001 and the verdict withstood appeal. American Express also filed suit.

On August 23, 2001, Mastercard International Inc. was sued for violating the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.

On November 15, 2004, Mastercard Inc. paid damages to American Express, due to anticompetitive practices that prevented American Express from issuing cards through U.S. banks, and paid $1.8 billion for settlement.

==== Swipe fee fixing and merchant discount bans ====
On November 27, 2012, a federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2005 by merchants and trade associations against Mastercard and Visa. The suit was filed due to alleged price-fixing practices employed by Mastercard and Visa. About one-fourth of the named class plaintiffs have decided to opt-out of the settlement. Opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement.

Plaintiffs allege that Visa Inc. and Mastercard fixed interchange fees, also known as swipe fees, that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lower-cost cards, cash, and checks.

A settlement of $6.24 billion got preliminary approval in November, 2019. A settlement of $5.54B was approved in 2019. Certain merchants appealed the settlement and were heard. The case is ongoing .

==== Antitrust settlement with U.S. Justice Department ====
In October 2010, Mastercard and Visa reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in another antitrust case. The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards (because interchange fees differ), or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards.

==== ATM operators ====
Mastercard, along with Visa, has been sued in a class action by ATM operators that claim the credit card networks&#x27; rules effectively fix ATM access fees. The suit claims that this is a restraint of trade in violation of federal law. The lawsuit was filed by the National ATM Council and independent operators of automated teller machines. More specifically, it is alleged that Mastercard&#x27;s and Visa&#x27;s network rules prohibit ATM operators from offering lower prices for transactions over PIN-debit networks that are not affiliated with Visa or Mastercard. The suit says that this price-fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using ATMs, limits the revenue that ATM operators earn, and violates the Sherman Act&#x27;s prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade. Johnathan Rubin, an attorney for the plaintiffs said, &quot;Visa and Mastercard are the ringleaders, organizers, and enforcers of a conspiracy among U.S. banks to fix the price of ATM access fees in order to keep the competition at bay.&quot;

=== Oceania ===
In 2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia required that interchange fees be dramatically reduced, from about 0.95% of the transaction to approximately 0.5%. One notable result has been the reduced use of reward cards and increased use of debit cards. Australia also prohibited the no surcharge rule, a policy established by credit card networks like Visa and Mastercard to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder. A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by a merchant, but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the card as the method of payment. Australia has also made changes to the interchange rates on debit cards and has considered abolishing interchange fees altogether.

As of November 2006, New Zealand was considering similar actions, following a Commerce Commission lawsuit alleging price-fixing by Visa and Mastercard. In New Zealand, merchants pay a 1.8% fee on every credit card transaction.

=== Europe ===
The European Union has repeatedly criticized Mastercard for monopolistic trade practices. In April 2009, Mastercard reached a settlement with the European Union in an antitrust case, promising to reduce debit card swipe fees to 0.2 percent of purchases. In December 2010, a senior official from the European Central Bank called for a break-up of the Visa/Mastercard duopoly by the creation of a new European debit card for use in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).

WikiLeaks published documents showing that American authorities lobbied Russia to defend the interests of Visa and Mastercard. In response, Mastercard blocked payments to WikiLeaks. Members of the European Parliament expressed concern that payments from European citizens to a European corporation could apparently be blocked by the United States and called for a further reduction in the dominance of Visa and Mastercard in the European payment system.

In 2013, Mastercard was under investigation by the European Union for the high fees it charged merchants to accept cards issued outside the EU, compared to cards issued in the EU, as well as other anti-competitive practices that could hinder electronic commerce and international trade, and high fees associated with premium credit cards. The EU&#x27;s competition regulator said that these fees were of special concern because of the growing role of non-cash payments. Mastercard was banned from charging fees on cross-border transactions conducted wholly within the EU via a ruling by the European Commission in 2007. The European Commission said that their investigation also included large differences in fees across national borders. For instance, a €50 payment might cost €0.10 in the Netherlands but eight times that amount in Poland. The Commission argues that Mastercard rules that prohibit merchants from enjoying better terms offered in other EU countries may be against antitrust law.

The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) praised the action against Mastercard. BEUC said interbank fees push up prices and hurt consumers. BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said, &quot;So in the end, all consumers are hit by a scheme which ultimately rewards the card company and issuing bank.&quot;

In January 2019, the European Commission imposed an antitrust fine of €570,566,000 on Mastercard for &quot;obstructing merchants&#x27; access to cross-border card payment services&quot;, due to Mastercard&#x27;s rules obliging acquiring banks to apply the interchange fees of the country where a retailer was located. The Commission concluded that Mastercard&#x27;s rules prevented retailers from benefitting from lower fees and restricted competition between banks cross border, in breach of EU antitrust rules. The infringement of antitrust rules ended when Mastercard amended its rules due to the entering into force of the Interchange Fee Regulation in 2015, which introduced caps on interchange fees. The Commission did grant Mastercard a 10% reduction of the fine however, in return for Mastercard acknowledging the facts and cooperating with the antitrust investigation.

In February 2021, following an investigation by the British Payment Systems Regulator, Mastercard admitted liability for breaching competition rules in relation to pre-paid cards.

== Other issues ==

=== United States internet gambling transactions ===
Mastercard, Visa, and other credit cards have been used to fund accounts since online gambling began in the mid-1990s.

On March 20, 2000, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, reviewed motions in &quot;Re: MasterCard International Inc.&quot; regarding multi-district litigation alleging Mastercard illegally interacted with a number of internet casinos. The plaintiffs alleged, among other claims, that Mastercard had violated the Federal Wire Act. They sought financial relief for losses suffered at online gambling sites outside the United States.

The District Court&#x27;s ruling on February 23, 2001, later upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, sided with Mastercard. The Fifth Circuit also clarified the application of the Wire Act to illegal online gambling. The Court determined that the wire act only applied to gambling activities related to a &quot;sporting event or contest&quot;. Therefore, the court could not conclude that Mastercard had violated the Wire Act.

When PASPA was overturned May 14, 2018, Mastercard had to provide new guidance to its member banks. It clarified that state location restrictions apply to the individual placing the wager, not the member bank processing the transaction. According to various state gaming laws, sports betting providers must use Internet geolocation to determine a customer&#x27;s physical location prior to accepting a wager. The Independent Community Bankers of America specifically requested information about a new online gambling merchant category code. Mastercard has dedicated MCC 7801 to online gambling. This code is distinct from 7800 for government owned lotteries and 7802 for government licensed horse and dog tracks.

=== Blocking payments to WikiLeaks ===
In December 2010, Mastercard blocked all payments to whistleblowing platform WikiLeaks due to claims that they engage in illegal activity. In response, a group of online activists Anonymous organized a denial-of-service attack; as a result, the Mastercard website experienced downtime on December 8–9, 2010. On December 9, 2010, the servers of Mastercard underwent a massive attack as part of an Operation Avenge Assange for closing down payments to WikiLeaks. The security of thousands of credit cards was compromised during that attack due to a phishing-site set up by the attackers. However, Mastercard denied this, stating that account data had &quot;not been placed at risk&quot;. WikiLeaks&#x27; spokesman said, &quot;We neither condemn nor applaud these attacks.&quot; U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said that closing down credit lines for donations to WikiLeaks &quot;could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information, thus potentially violating WikiLeaks&#x27; right to freedom of expression&quot;.

In July 2011, Iceland-based IT firm DataCell, the company that enabled WikiLeaks to accept credit and debit card donations, said it would take legal action against Visa Europe and Mastercard, and that it would move immediately to try to force the two companies to resume allowing payments to the website. Earlier on December 8, 2010, DataCell&#x27;s CEO Andreas Fink had stated that &quot;suspension of payments towards WikiLeaks is a violation of the agreements with their customers.&quot; On July 14, 2011, DataCell announced they had filed a complaint with the European Commission claiming the closure by Visa and Mastercard of Datacell&#x27;s access to the payment card networks violated the competition rules of the European Community.

On July 12, 2012, a Reykjavík court ruled that Valitor, Visa and Mastercard&#x27;s partner in Iceland, had to start processing donations within fourteen days or pay daily fines to the amount of ISK 800,000 (some $6000) for each day after that time, to open the payment gateway. Valitor also had to pay DataCell&#x27;s litigation costs of ISK 1,500,000.

===Corporate branding of all Nigerian identity cards===
In 2014, pursuant to an agreement between Mastercard and the Nigerian Government, acting through the National Identity Management Commission, the new Nigerian ID cards bear the Mastercard logo, contain personal database data and double as payment cards, irrevocably linking such payments to the individuals, sparking criticism by the Civil Rights Congress alleging that it &quot;represents a stamped ownership of a Nigerian by an American company ... reminiscent of the logo pasted on the bodies of African slaves transported across the Atlantic.&quot;

===Selling of credit card data===
In 2018, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported that Google had paid millions of dollars to Mastercard for its users&#x27; credit card data for advertising purposes. The deal had not been publicly announced.

=== Regulatory ban In India ===
On July 14, 2021, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) indefinitely barred Mastercard from issuing new debit or credit cards to domestic Indian customers starting July 22, 2021, for violating data localization and storage rules as set by RBI on April 6, 2018, under Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (PSS Act). This ban does not affect cards already issued and working in India. Mastercard is the third major payment systems provider to be restricted in India after American Express and Diners Club International. On June 16, 2022, the business restrictions imposed were lifted by RBI with immediate effect.

=== Regulatory ban In Vietnam ===
In 2018, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) requested that banks temporarily halt the issuance of new Mastercard cards due to violations of international payment regulations. Specifically, Mastercard did not comply with the regulation of conducting payments through the National Payment Corporation of Vietnam (NAPAS). In 2020, the ban was lifted after Mastercard committed to complying with Vietnamese regulations. Despite its widespread acceptance, using Mastercard in Vietnam still comes with certain limitations: Some Vietnamese websites and applications do not accept Mastercard as a payment method. Not all ATMs in Vietnam allow cash withdrawals using Mastercard. Some Mastercard users in Vietnam have reported experiencing inadequate customer service.
=== Adult content restrictions ===
In December 2020, Mastercard barred the use of its credit cards on Pornhub, an online pornography site. In April 2023, The Hill reported on an update to Mastercard&#x27;s policy for adult content that would require sellers to have age and identity verifications and content review prior to posting in place. The new policies took effect in October 2021. On August 30, 2023, the American Civil Liberties Union, in combination with a coalition of other organizations, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission requesting an investigation into the policy as an unfair business practice under Section 5 of the FTC Act.

== Products ==

Credit cards: 
* Traditional/Classic/Standard

* Black
* World Elite

Debit cards: 
* Traditional/Classic/Standard 
* Gold/Titanium

* Platinum

Through a partnership with an Internet company that specializes in personalized shopping, Mastercard introduced a Web shopping mall on April 16, 2010, that it said can pinpoint with considerable accuracy what its cardholders are likely to purchase.

In September 2014 Mastercard worked with Apple to incorporate a new mobile wallet feature into Apple&#x27;s new iPhone and Apple Watch models known as Apple Pay, enabling users to more readily use their Mastercard, and other credit cards.

In May 2020, Mastercard announced the Mastercard Track Business Payment Service. The service will provide business-to-business payments between buyers and suppliers. According to the head of global commercial products, it &quot;creates a directory of suppliers, enabling suppliers to publish their payment rules so they can better control how they receive payments while making it easier for buyers to find suppliers and understand their requirements&quot;.

On February 10, 2021, Mastercard announced their support of cryptocurrencies saying that later in 2021, Mastercard will start supporting select cryptocurrencies directly on their network. One of the main focus areas that Mastercard wants to support is using digital assets for payments, and that crypto assets will need to offer the stability people need in a vehicle for spending, not investment. In October 2021, Mastercard announced that through its partnership with Bakkt, any bank or merchant on its network would soon be able to offer crypto services. In June 2022, Mastercard announced that it would now be allowing cardholders to purchase NFTs via various NFT scaling platforms.

===Prepaid debit cards===
Mastercard, Comerica Bank, and the U.S. Treasury Department teamed up in 2008 to create the Direct Express Debit Mastercard. The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue electronic payments to people who do not have bank accounts. Comerica Bank is the issuing bank for the debit card.

The Direct Express cards give recipients a number of consumer protections.

In June 2013, Mastercard announced a partnership with British Airways to offer members the Executive Club Multi-currency Cash Passport, which will allow members to earn extra points and make multi-currency payments. The Passport card allows users to load up to ten currencies (euro, pound, U.S. dollar, Turkish lira, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, U.A.E. dirham, and South African rand) at a locked-in rate. When used, the card selects the local currency to ensure the best exchange rate, and if the local currency is not already loaded onto the card, funds are used from other currencies.

=== QkR ===
QkR is a mobile payment app developed by Mastercard operating in the US and Australia for the purpose of ordering products and services through a smartphone with payments charged to the associated credit card. It is being deployed for use in large-scale events, such as sport events, concerts, movie theaters or schools. Unlike other Mastercard mobile payment apps such as Pay Pass, QkR does not use NFC from the phone, but rather an Internet connection.

Users can open the app, scan a QR code located on the back of the seat in front of them, and place orders for refreshments of their choice. The order is dispatched to a nearby concession stand.

QkR is being marketed to vendors as a replacement for other mobile payment apps and a mobile ordering app, either distributed by the vendor (such as Starbucks&#x27;s app, McDonald&#x27;s&#x27; app, or Chipotle&#x27;s mobile ordering app) or by a third party, such as Square, headed by Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey.

=== Mastercard Contactless ===

Mastercard Contactless (formerly PayPass) is an EMV-compatible, contactless payment feature similar to American Express&#x27; ExpressPay, and Visa payWave. All three use the same symbol as shown on the right. It is based on the ISO/IEC 14443 standard that provides cardholders with a simpler way to pay by tapping a payment card or other payment device, such as a phone or key fob, on a point-of-sale terminal reader rather than swiping or inserting a card. Contactless can currently be used on transactions up to and including 100 GBP, 50 EUR, 60 BAM, 80 CHF, 50 USD, 100 CAD, 200 SEK, 500 NOK, 100 PLN, 350 DKK, 80 NZD, 100 AUD, 1000 RUB, 500 UAH, 500 TRY depending on the card&#x27;s currency rather than the transaction currency or 5000 INR.


In 2003, Mastercard concluded a nine-month PayPass market trial in Orlando, Florida, with JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and MBNA. More than 16,000 cardholders and more than 60 retailer locations participated in the market trial. In addition, Mastercard worked with Nokia and the Nokia 6131, AT&amp;T Wireless, and JPMorgan Chase to incorporate Mastercard PayPass into mobile phones using near-field communication technology, in Dallas, Texas. In 2011, Google and Mastercard launched Google Wallet, an Android application which allows a mobile device to send credit/debit card information directly to a PayPass-enabled payment terminal, bypassing the need for a physical card, up until the creation of Google Pay. In 2014, the Apple released Apple Pay for iOS devices.

During late 2015, Citicards in the US stopped issuing PayPass-enabled plastic, but the keyfob was still available upon request. Effective July 16, 2016, Citicards stopped supporting PayPass completely. While existing plastic and keyfobs continued to work until their expiration date, no new PayPass-enabled hardware was issued to US customers after that date.

=== Crypto ===
In April 2023, Mastercard announced its intention to expand its partnerships with cryptocurrency firms. At the time of the announcement, the firm had already partnered with other financial companies to offer cards linked to crypto in some nations. This was despite an increasingly intense regulatory environment, and it followed rival company Visa stopping its agreement with FTX in November 2022. The company said its Mastercard Crypto Credential service would allow for transactions between countries that met requirements like so-called &quot;travel rule&quot; by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), using technology from CipherTrace. It also worked with wallet providers Bit2Me, Lirium, Mercado Bitcoin, and Uphold. Its head of crypto and blockchain, Raj Dhamodharan, said uses for NFT transactions would come later on.

==Branding==

Mastercard is associated with security and is believed to be reliable in emergencies. Antitrust litigation over the years has damaged the brand.

Mastercard&#x27;s current advertising campaign tagline is &quot;Priceless&quot;. It started in 1997. The slogan associated with the campaign is &quot;There are some things money can&#x27;t buy. For everything else, there&#x27;s Mastercard.&quot; The Priceless campaign in more recent iterations has been applicable to both Mastercard&#x27;s credit card and debit card products. They also use the &quot;Priceless&quot; description to promote products such as their &quot;priceless travel&quot; site, which features deals and offers for Mastercard holders, and &quot;priceless cities,&quot; offers for people in specified locations.

In mid-2006, MasterCard International changed its name to MasterCard Worldwide. This was to suggest a more global scale. In addition, the company introduced a new corporate logo adding a third circle to the two that had been used in the past (the familiar card logo, resembling a Venn diagram, remained unchanged). A new corporate tagline was introduced at the same time—&quot;The Heart of Commerce&quot;.

In July 2016, Mastercard introduced their new rebranding, along with a new corporate logo. In addition, they changed their service name from &quot;MasterCard&quot; to &quot;mastercard&quot;.

In January 2019, Mastercard removed its name from its logo, leaving just the overlapping discs.

In 2021, Mastercard was ranked number 13 on Morning Consult&#x27;s list of most trusted brands.

=== Sports sponsorships ===
Mastercard sponsors major sporting events and teams throughout the world. These include rugby&#x27;s New Zealand, the MLB, the UEFA Champions League and the PGA Tour&#x27;s Arnold Palmer Invitational. Previously, it also sponsored the FIFA World Cup but withdrew its contract after a court settlement and its rival, Visa, took up the contract in 2007. In 1997, Mastercard was the main sponsor of the Mastercard Lola Formula One team, which withdrew from the 1997 Formula One season after having failed to qualify its first race due to financial problems. The team also sponsored Jordan Grand Prix from the 1998 season through to end of the 2000 Formula One season and on 24 July 2024 it was announced the company would return to F1 after signing a multi-year sponsorship deal with McLaren Racing. It also partners the Brazil national football team and the Copa Libertadores.

Mastercard was also the title sponsor for the Alamo Bowl game from 2002 until 2005.

In late 2018, Mastercard became the first major sponsor for &quot;League of Legends&quot; esports. The company sponsors the League of Legends World Championship, Mid-Season Invitational, and the All-stars event for &quot;League of Legends&quot;.

Until 2018, Mastercard was the sponsor of the Memorial Cup, the CHL&#x27;s annual championship between its three leagues.

In September 2022, Mastercard acquired the title sponsorship rights for all international and domestic home matches organized by the Board of Cricket Control in India.

==Corporate affairs==

Mastercard has its headquarters in the Mastercard International Global Headquarters in Purchase, New York. The Global Operations Center is located in O&#x27;Fallon, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri.

Mastercard was listed as one of the best companies to work for in 2013 by Forbes. In 2016, Mastercard UK became one of 144 companies who signed the HM Treasury&#x27;s Women in Finance Charter, a pledge for balanced gender representation in the company.

==World Beyond Cash==
In 2017, CEO Ajay Banga reinforced the company&#x27;s goal of extending financial services to those outside the current system by bringing digital payment systems to the unbanked around the world. The company invested $500M in India with offices in Pune and Vadodara to help Mastercard bring cashless transactions to the largest population in the world. The company also is scheduled to invest an additional $750M in cashless apps and technology, especially focused on India between 2017 and 2020.

==Banknet==

Mastercard operates Banknet, a global telecommunications network linking all Mastercard card issuers, acquirers, and data processing centers into a single financial network. The operations hub is located in St. Louis, Missouri. Banknet uses the ISO 8583 protocol.

Mastercard&#x27;s network differs significantly from Visa&#x27;s. Visa&#x27;s is a star-based system where all endpoints terminate at one of several main data centers, where all transactions are processed centrally. Mastercard&#x27;s network is an edge-based, peer-to-peer network where transactions travel a meshed network directly to other endpoints, without the need to travel to a single point. This allows Mastercard&#x27;s network to be much more resilient, in that a single failure cannot isolate a large number of endpoints.

<doc id="378792" wikidata="Q3098666" url="?curid=378792" title="Moisés Alou">
<text>Moisés Rojas-Alou Beltré (; ; born July 3, 1966) is an American former professional baseball outfielder who has played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1990 to 2008. He played in MLB for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Montreal Expos, Florida Marlins, Houston Astros, Chicago Cubs, San Francisco Giants, and New York Mets. 

He is a member of one of the sport&#x27;s most notable families of the late 20th century, being the son of famed first baseman and manager Felipe Alou. A mainly offensive player who admitted himself that he was not particularly strong on defense, Alou was never a serious Hall of Fame contender, but his career was noteworthy in several respects nevertheless. He was a six-time All-Star, a two-time Silver Slugger Award winner and a 1997 World Series champion.

==Baseball career==

Alou was more interested in playing basketball during his youth and did not play organized baseball until he attended Cañada College in Redwood City, California, at the age of 18. It was there that baseball scouts noticed his bat speed and speed on the base paths. In , Alou was the second overall pick in the MLB January Draft, chosen by the Pittsburgh Pirates.

Alou is one of the few modern baseball players who batted without the use of batting gloves. Instead, Moisés Alou revealed that during the baseball season, he&#x27;d urinate on his hands to toughen them up.

===Montreal Expos===
In , he was traded to the Montreal Expos where he would later play under his father while he managed the Expos.
Alou suffered a severe ankle injury in that would rob him of his speed and force him to become strictly a corner outfielder. He recovered in , hitting .339 and had the game-winning hit in that year&#x27;s All-Star Game. For the next two seasons, he would enjoy success at the plate in Montreal, although surgery to both shoulders prematurely ended his season.

===Florida Marlins===
Prior to the season, Alou signed as a free agent with the Florida Marlins, where he led the team with 23 home runs and 115 RBIs. The Marlins made the playoffs as a wild card team and defeated the San Francisco Giants in the National League Divisional Series. The Marlins then defeated the Atlanta Braves in the National League Championship Series before going to the World Series, which Florida won in seven games. Alou led the team by hitting .321 with 3 home runs and 9 RBI in the World Series (although, pitcher Liván Hernández, by virtue of his wins in Games 1 and 5, was named the Series Most Valuable Player instead).

===Houston Astros===
Before the season, the Marlins traded Alou to the Houston Astros. In his first season with the team, Alou hit a career-high 38 home runs and drove in 124 runs while leading the Astros to a (then) franchise-record 102 wins. However, he tore his ACL in a treadmill accident in the offseason and missed the entire season. Once recovered, he returned to the Astros lineup to hit .355 in and .331 in , while driving in at least 108 runs in each season. After the 2001 season, the Astros did not offer Alou a new contract due to budget constraints, making him a free agent.

===Chicago Cubs===

In December 2001, he signed a three-year, $27 million contract with the Chicago Cubs.

At the start of the 2002 season Alou again ended up on the disabled list, and once healthy, he hit .275 and 15 home runs. After the 2002 season, Alou hired a personal trainer and dedicated himself to returning to his old form. In the season, Alou batted over .300 for most of the season before a late-season slump dropped his season batting average to .280, with 22 home runs and 91 RBI. Alou went on to lead the team in batting average in its two series against the Atlanta Braves and Florida Marlins.

In Game 6 of the National League Championship Series against the Florida Marlins that year, Alou was involved in the Steve Bartman incident, in which Cubs fan Steve Bartman deflected a foul ball landing one row into the stands. Bartman&#x27;s deflection prevented Alou, who reached into the stands, from attempting to catch the ball for an out that could have been the second out of the 8th Inning. However, the Marlins went on to score eight runs in the inning, in which the Cubs had been ahead 3–0. The Cubs, who had led the series 3–2, lost the game 8–3 and eventually lost the series in 7 games. Alou openly admitted later in interviews that while he was frustrated at the moment, he could not have made the catch anyway. Later, Alou denied making such a statement and said if he had, it was only to make Bartman feel better.

In , Alou set new career highs in home runs (39) and doubles (36), while driving in 106 runs. However, the Cubs missed the playoffs after losing seven of their last nine games. The Cubs refused to offer arbitration and let him go, citing numerous fights with umpires who, he claimed, had a vendetta against him.

===San Francisco Giants and New York Mets===
In October 2004, Alou announced that he had talked to his father, Felipe, about possibly playing for him and the Giants next season. In December 2004, he signed a one-year deal with the Giants worth $13.5 million, with a player option for a second year. Alou was expected to regularly play in right field for the first time since 2001, but because of injuries to left fielder Barry Bonds, he started most games in left field. Alou had stated that he would retire if the Giants won the World Series in . They did not, and Alou exercised his option to stay with San Francisco in the season, hitting 22 home runs and 74 RBI.

On November 20, 2006, the New York Mets signed Alou to a one-year contract worth $7.5 million with a club option for . After hitting .318 in his first month as the regular left fielder, Alou suffered a torn quadriceps muscle and was forced out until August. Upon his return, Alou led the Mets with a .345 batting average and had a 30-game hitting streak. The streak was the longest streak of the season, was the longest hitting streak by a player over age 40, and broke the Mets&#x27; overall and single-season hitting streak records. On October 31, 2007, the Mets exercised their option on Alou&#x27;s contract for the 2008 season.
On March 5, 2008, Alou underwent hernia surgery and missed the start of the 2008 season. On July 9, Alou suffered a torn right hamstring playing in the outfield for AA Binghamton in Norwich, Connecticut. Mets general manager Omar Minaya stated in a press conference the following day that Alou would likely need surgery and miss the remainder of the 2008 season, which ended his career.

On March 5, 2009, Alou announced that he would retire after the World Baseball Classic.

=== Post playing career ===
In 2014, in his first year of Hall of Fame eligibility, Alou received six votes (1.1%) and was dropped from subsequent ballots.

==Personal life==
He is the youngest of three sons born to Felipe and his first wife Maria Beltre, who raised him in the Dominican Republic after his parents divorced when he was two.

His father Felipe, who managed Moises with the Expos from 1992 to 1996 and the Giants from 2005 to 2006, as well as uncles Matty and Jesús, and cousin Mel Rojas, all had long careers in Major League Baseball. In 2008, he was one of four active major leaguers (along with Prince Fielder, Ken Griffey Jr., and Daryle Ward) to hit 20 home runs in a season whose fathers had also hit 20 home runs in an MLB season.

His half-brother, Luis Rojas, was the manager of the New York Mets in 2020 and 2021.

<text>Gymnolaemata are a class of Bryozoans. Gymnolaemata are sessile, mostly marine organisms and grow on the surfaces of rocks, kelp, and in some cases on animals, like fish. Zooids are cylindrical or flattened. The lophophore is protruded by action of muscles pulling on the frontal wall. This order includes the majority of living bryozoan species.

<text>Cheilostomatida, also called Cheilostomata, is an order of Bryozoa in the class Gymnolaemata.

They are exclusively marine, colonial invertebrate animals. Cheilostome colonies are composed of calcium carbonate and grow on a variety of surfaces, including rocks, shells, seagrass and kelps. The colony shapes range from simple encrusting sheets to erect branching and even unattached forms. As in other bryozoan groups, each colony is composed of a few to thousands of individual polypides. Each individual has a U-shaped gut, and no respiratory or circulatory system. Unique among bryozoans, cheilostome polypides are housed in a box-shaped zooids, which do not grow larger once the zooid is mature. The opening through which the polypide protrudes is protected by a calcareous or chitinous lidlike structure, an operculum. Cheilostomes possess avicularia, which have modified the operculum into a range of mandibles (possibly for defense) or hair-like setae (possibly for cleaning).

The cheilostomes are the most abundant and varied of modern bryozoans. The classification in suborders is based upon frontal calcification and the mechanism of lophophore protrusion.

==Evolution==
Cheilostomes first appeared in the Late Jurassic (&quot;Pyriporopsis&quot;) but diversified very slowly during the Early Cretaceous, with only 1 family known up to the Albian. During the Late Cretaceous, cheilostomes diversified rapidly to reach a level of more than 20 families in the Maastrichtian, replacing cyclostomes as the dominant group of bryozoans. At the same time new forms evolved which partly or fully used aragonite instead of calcite in their exoskeleton. This diversification is thought to be a consequence of the evolution of a new larval type. Though the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event had some impact on genetic diversity, the rapid diversification continued into the Eocene, then apparently reaching a plateau of about 50 families up to the Holocene.

Most species incubate their offspring in brood chambers which has evolved independently at least 10 times in the order.

<doc id="378811" wikidata="Q702839" url="?curid=378811" title="Control Yuan">
<text>The Control Yuan is the supervisory and auditory branch of the government of the Republic of China, both during its time in mainland China and Taiwan.

Designed as a hybrid of auditor and ombudsman by Taiwanese law, the Control Yuan holds the following powers:

* &quot;Impeachment&quot;: The Control Yuan has the power to impeach government officials. Successfully impeached cases then go to the Disciplinary Court of the Judicial Yuan for adjudication. Impeachment of the President and the Vice President of the Republic follows a different procedure and does not go through the Control Yuan.
* &quot;Censure&quot;: The Control Yuan also has the power to censure a government official. The censure is sent to the official&#x27;s superior officer.
* &quot;Audit&quot;: The Executive Yuan (cabinet) presents the annual budget to the Control Yuan each year for audit.
*&quot;Corrective Measures&quot;: The Control Yuan, after investigating the work and facilities of the Executive Yuan and its subordinate organs, may propose corrective measures to the Executive Yuan or its subordinate organs for improvement after these measures are examined and approved by the relevant committees.

According to the current Constitution, the Control Yuan shall consist of 29 members. One member shall be the President of the Control Yuan, and another shall be the Vice President. All members, including the President and Vice President of Control Yuan, shall be nominated by the President of the Republic and approved by Legislative Yuan (the parliament of Taiwan). Members serve with a term limit of six years.

Prior to constitutional reforms in the 1990s, the Control Yuan, along with National Assembly (electoral college) and the Legislative Yuan (lower house) formed the national tricameral parliament. It functioned similarly to an upper house of a bicameral legislature, though it formed its own separate branch and was indirectly elected by provincial or municipal legislatures with 178 senators elected.

== Structure ==
===Members composition===
The Control Yuan consists of a council with 29 members, including a President and a Vice President and the National Audit Office. All 29 members and the auditor-general are nominated by the President of the Republic and approved by Legislative Yuan for 6-year terms. The incumbent 6th Control Yuan was nominated by President Tsai Ing-wen on June 22, 2020 and later confirmed by Legislative Yuan on July 17, 2020. Members inaugurated on August 1, 2020, and their terms expire on July 31, 2026.

=== Council and committees ===
The council of the Yuan, chaired by the Yuan President, is divided into a number of committees to exercise the Yuan&#x27;s supervision power. No member of the Control Yuan can hold another public office or profession while serving in the branch (according to Article 103 of the constitution), and members must be able to perform absent of partisan control or influence. Members can vote in no more than three committees and can join additional committees as non-voting members. Each committee can have up to 14 members and usually elects a convenor amongst themselves to chair committee meetings.

The following responsibilities were also assigned by various acts.

* Anti-Corruption: The Anti-Corruption Committee is a seven-member committee, which cannot include the President of Vice President of the Control Yuan, which deals with asset declarations by government officials, recusals due to conflict of interest, and political donations.
* Examination Invigilation: The Control Yuan also appoints proctors to supervise examinations for civil servants.

===National Human Rights Commission===
The National Human Rights Committee is a ten-member committee under the Control Yuan which investigates human rights abuses, proposes human rights laws, compiles an annual report and promotes human rights education. The President of the Control Yuan must be a member of the committee. The committee was established by the National Human Rights Committee Organic Law on 10 December 2019.

===Administrative Appeal Committee===
An Administrative Appeal Committee, operated under the aegis of the Control Yuan but consisting of both members and non-members of the Control Yuan, considers administrative appeals which are inappropriate to both the Control Yuan proper and the Ministry of Audit.

=== National Audit Office ===

The National Audit Office is headed by an auditor-general who is nominated by the President of the Republic and appointed with consent of Legislative Yuan (parliament), exercises the Control Yuan&#x27;s power of audit. It consists of five departments:

* General public affairs audit department
* National defense expenditures audit department
* Special public affairs audit department
* State-run corporations and government-owned businesses audit department
* Financial affairs audit department (also in charge of supervising local government audits)

In addition, most local governments have established the Audit Divisions/Offices, these serve as the subordinate agencies of the National Audit Office. Currently, 21 local governments of the 22 administrative divisions of Taiwan have Audit Divisions/Offices (except Lienchiang County).

== Impeachment procedure and notable cases ==
The Control Yuan is responsible to investigate possible violations on laws and regulations of public servants and raise impeachments if needed. Investigations are initiated by at least two members, and investigation committees must consist of at least nine members of the Control Yuan. The impeachment cases would be determined by a majority vote by members of investigation committee. Successful impeachment cases will then be forwarded to the Disciplinary Court () under the Judicial Yuan for adjudication. However, the impeachment of the President or Vice President shall be initiated by Legislative Yuan (parliament) and adjudicate by the Constitutional Court under the Judicial Yuan. Details regarding impeachment proceedings are stipulated in the Enforcement Rules of the Control Act.

* On 19 February 2020, the Control Yuan impeached five military personnel which it deemed responsible for a F-16 Fighter aircraft crash on June 4, 2018, that killed all on board. The case was forwarded to the Public Functionary Disciplinary Sanction Commission in the Judicial Yuan to determine the punishment.
* On 4 June 2019, Hsieh Kung-ping (謝公秉), a top aide of former Hualien County commissioner Fu Kun-chi, Lin Chin-hu (林金虎), a county government employee, and media section chief Huang Wei-jun (黃微鈞), were impeached for bribery using $5.26 million in public funds. Both were found guilty on 18 February 2020; Hsieh was given two demerits and fined $100,000 NTD, Lin was handed a 10% pay reduction for a year, and Huang was given one demerit and fined $100,000 NTD.
* On 15 January 2019, Kuan Chung-ming, the president of National Taiwan University, was impeached for violating a law prohibiting public servants from working other jobs. The case was forwarded to the Public Functionary Disciplinary Sanction Commission in the Judicial Yuan to determine whether he was guilty and the appropriate punishment. Kuan was found guilty on 2 September 2019 and officially reprimanded.

== History ==
=== Constitutional theory ===
The concept of Control Yuan was introduced by Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s &quot;Three Principles of the People&quot;. The theory proposed a separation of powers into five branches (). Sun Yat-sen demonstrated the benefit of separating the supervision and auditing power from the legislature by the designation of the state organs of the Imperial China. He quotes the long tradition of supervision used in past dynasties, ranging from the &quot;Censor&quot; () established by the Qin () and Han () dynasties to the &quot;tái&quot; () and &quot;jiàn&quot; () offices established under the Sui () and Tang () dynasties (&quot;tai&quot; were selected to supervise civil officials and military officers, while &quot;jian&quot; were selected to counsel the emperor on supervisory matters) to the Board of Public Censors () selected under the Ming () and Qing () dynasties. Most of these offices also operated local and provincial branches to supervise local governments. Under the Qing dynasty, the Board of Public Censors consisted of forty or fifty members, and two presidents, one of Manchu ancestry and the other of Han Chinese ancestry. They were, in theory, allowed to send one censor to participate in the meetings of all government boards. The Board&#x27;s powers were minimized by the time of political flux which preceded the end of the Empire.

However, the 1947 Constitution of the Republic of China has many influences from the resolutions of the Political Consultative Assembly held between the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) and the Chinese Communist Party. Carsun Chang, the major author of the Constitution draft in the Political Consultative Assembly, considered the fact that the supervision and auditing power is traditionally held by the legislature, and also the proposal of federalism from the Communist Party in the drafting process. He designed the Control Yuan to be a chamber of parliament that is indirectly elected by the provincial legislatures of China. The Control Yuan has some similarities to the United States Senate, which allocated a similar number of seats to each province of China and holds the power to confirm many important public positions in the Judicial Yuan and Examination Yuan appointed by the President of the Republic.

In the 1947 constitution, the Control Yuan, together with National Assembly and Legislative Yuan, thus formed chambers of a tricameral parliament according to the Judicial Yuan&#x27;s interpretation number 76 of the Constitution in 1957. The Control Yuan was given the power to request documents from other government agencies and investigate them for violations of law or neglect as under Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s ideology. The auditor-general was considered elected by the Control Yuan, who shall be nominated by the President of the Republic with consent of the Legislative Yuan, who was responsible for submitting reports on government budgets. Finally, the Control Yuan had confirmation power for the President, Vice President and members of the Judicial Yuan and Examination Yuan.

=== Establishment and relocation to Taiwan ===
In the early republican era, the Beiyang government was in favor of the traditional three-branch form of separation of powers. However, a weak culture of republicanism and, later, the Warlord Era suppressed the implementation of this constitutional ideology.

After a successful Northern Expedition campaign, the Kuomintang secured its leadership in China and started to build the Nationalist government according to Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s ideology. Five branches (&quot;Yuan&quot;s) were created under the Kuomintang&#x27;s party-state administration. During this time, the Auditing Yuan () was established in February 1928, but in February 1931, the Control Yuan was established and the Auditing Yuan was downgraded to the current ministry-level National Audit Office within the Control Yuan. The creation of Control Yuan on 16 February 1931 was the last establishment of the five-&quot;Yuan&quot;s.

However, the 1947 Constitution of the Republic of China, although retaining the architecture of the five-branch government, changed the Control Yuan to be a parliament chamber. Under the constitution, members of the Yuan (by now senators &quot;de facto&quot;) were elected from regional legislatures: 5 from each province, 2 from each direct-administered municipality, 8 from Mongolia (by 1948 only the Inner Mongolian provinces were represented), 8 from Tibet, and 8 from the overseas Chinese communities. As originally envisioned both the President and Vice President of the Control Yuan were to be elected by and from the members like the speaker of many other parliamentary bodies worldwide. Following the promulgation of the &quot;Constitution&quot;, the 178 first Control Yuan senators elected by the regional legislatures convened in Nanking on June 4, 1948, for the opening of their chamber. The first Control Yuan then confirmed the leaders and members of the first Judicial Yuan and Examination Yuan. The transition from one-party state Nationalist government to constitutional government was hence completed.

However, a year later, the Kuomintang-led government of the Republic of China lost the Chinese Civil War and retreated to Taiwan in December 1949. Taiwan had been under Japanese rule before August 15, 1945; as a result of World War II, the Republic of China Armed Forces occupied Taiwan on behalf of the Allies. The government established Taiwan Province to mark its annexation of Taiwan. There were 104 members who retreated to Taiwan with the government, including 5 senators from Taiwan. The Control Yuan occupied the former governmental building of Taihoku Prefecture in the Japanese era. The term of the retreated senators was extended indefinitely until &quot;re-election is possible in their original electoral district.&quot; During this era, the first Control Yuan members continued to conduct sessions in Taipei until they were ordered to retire by the Judicial Yuan (Constitutional Court) in 1991.

With the reduction of members due to age, elections were held from 1969 to 1986 to elect new senators to the Yuan from Taiwan, and the cities of Taipei and Kaoshung were soon represented.

Until 1993, the Control Yuan&#x27;s legislative work was limited to helping to audit the national budget, which would then be presented to the Legislative Yuan. The other actions the then chamber took were its impeachment, confirmation and censure powers, applied whenever necessary.

=== Democratization ===
Democratization took place in Taiwan starting late 1980s; the movement resulted in a series of constitutional amendment known as the Additional Articles of the Constitution. On May 27, 1992, the second amendment removed the Control Yuan from parliament chambers and its members removed from their legislative duties. Decision process of leaders and members of the Control Yuan follows a similar pattern of Judicial Yuan and Examination Yuan. These officials were nominated by the President of the Republic and confirmation by the National Assembly. The National Assembly was another parliament chamber that can hold the confirmation process to maintain the separation of powers.

On 18 July 1997, by the 4th constitutional amendment, the procedure to impeach the President and Vice President of the Republic was transferred out from the Control Yuan. In this amendment, presidential impeachment shall be initiated by Legislative Yuan and voted by the National Assembly. However, the later political developments in Taiwan has inclined to simplify the parliament to one chamber. The Legislative Yuan was the surviving chamber and the National Assembly was then abolished. Since 25 April 2000, confirmation of leaders and members of the Control Yuan are transferred to Legislative Yuan, together with the confirmation of similar officials of Judicial Yuan and Examination Yuan.

At the end of 2004, President Chen Shui-bian sent a list of nominees to positions in the Control Yuan to the Legislative Yuan for approval. The coalition of Kuomintang and People First Party, which then held a majority in the Legislative Yuan, refused to ratify President Chen&#x27;s nominees and demanded that he submit a new list. The political deadlock that resulted stopped the Control Yuan from functioning from February 2005 to July 2008. The situation resolved after Kuomintang&#x27;s candidate Ma Ying-jeou was elected as the President in 2008 Taiwanese presidential election and Kuomintang won the supermajority of Legislative Yuan seats in 2008 Taiwanese legislative election. Mr. Wang Chien-shien was then appointed to be its president under the Ma Ying-jeou administration.

In 2016, Democratic Progressive Party&#x27;s candidate Tsai Ing-wen was elected as the President in 2016 Taiwanese presidential election and Democratic Progressive Party won the majority of Legislative Yuan seats in 2016 Taiwanese legislative election. On 10 December 2019, the Legislative Yuan passed the National Human Rights Committee Organic Law (國家人權委員會組織法), which established the National Human Rights Committee under the Control Yuan. Its duties include investigating human rights abuses, proposing human rights laws, compiling an annual report, and educational promotion of human rights, in accordance with the Paris Principles. The committee will consist of 10 members, one of which is the President of the Control Yuan who heads the committee. It launched on August 1, 2020, with former democracy activist Chen Chu as president. Kuomintang member Justin Huang was discussed as a potential vice-president, but he declined the position after receiving criticism from both the KMT for crossing party lines without consultation and the DPP for his role in the construction of the Taitung Miramar Resort while he was county magistrate, for which the county government was censured by the Control Yuan.

==Elections and terms==
The Kuomintang-led government of the Republic of China retreated to Taiwan in 1949, the year following the elections after the enactment of the 1947 constitution. As the Kuomintang government continues to claim sovereignty over mainland China, the term limit of the original Members of the Control Yuan was extended until &quot;re-election is possible in their original electoral districts.&quot; In response to the increasing democracy movement in Taiwan, limited supplementary elections were held in the Free Area (Taiwan) starting 1969. Members elected in these supplementary elections served together with those who were elected in 1948. This situation remained until a Constitutional Court (Judicial Yuan) ruling on June 21, 1991, that ordered the retirement of all members with extended terms by the end of 1991.

<text>The Examination Yuan is the civil service commission branch in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants of the government of the Republic of China (Taiwan). It has a president, a vice president, and seven to nine members, all of whom are nominated by the president of the republic and confirmed by the Legislative Yuan for four-year terms according to Republic of China laws.

==Organizational structure==
===Members composition===
The Examination Yuan consists of a council with a president, a vice president, and seven to nine members. The leaders and members are nominated by the president of the republic and approved by Legislative Yuan for four-year terms. The most recent 14th Examination Yuan was nominated by President Lai Ching-te on May 31, 2024, and all nominations except one were later confirmed by Legislative Yuan on December 17, 2024. Members of the 14th Yuan were inaugurated on December 20, 2024, and their terms will expired on August 31, 2028.
===Agencies===
The Examination Yuan has four main agencies:
* The Ministry of Examination (), which administers examinations for civil servants and contract personnel.
* Ministry of Civil Service (), which oversees the pay, promotion, and retirement of civil servants.
* Civil Service Protection and Training Commission (), which is responsible for training and protecting the rights of civil servants.
* Public Service Pension Fund Supervisory Board ()

===Offices and committees===
The Examination Yuan also includes twelve offices and three committees:
* Counselors
* Secretariat
* First Division
* Second Division
* Third Division
* Editing and Compilation Office
* Information Management Office
* Secretary Office
* Personnel Office
* Accounting Office
* Statistics Office
* Civil Service Ethics Office
* Petition and Appeals Committee
* Legal Affairs Committee
* Research and Development Committee

==History==
===Constitutional theory===
The concept of Examination Yuan is a part of the Three Principles of the People formulated by Sun Yat-sen, which was enlightened by the old Imperial examination system used in Imperial China. It is one of the five government branches (&quot;yuans&quot;) of the Government of the Republic of China. Practically, it operates like a ministry of the Executive Yuan, though its members may not be removed by the president or premier. 

===Establishment and relocation to Taiwan===

After the end of Northern Expedition in 1928, the Nationalist government set up the preparatory office of the Examination Yuan in October 1928 in which the organic law was promulgated. In May 1929, the headquarters of the Examination Yuan was inaugurated at Guan Gong and Yue Fei Temple in Nanjing. In January 1930, the Examination Yuan and its subordinates Examination Committee and Ministry of Civil Service were formally established. In December 1937, the headquarters was temporarily relocated to Chongqing during the Second Sino-Japanese War. After the end of World War II in 1945, the headquarters was moved back to Nanjing.

In January 1950, the headquarters were relocated temporarily to Taipei Confucius Temple in Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War. In December 1951, the headquarters were moved to Muzha District, Taipei. In March 1990, the Yuheng Building of the Yuan was inaugurated. 

===Democratization===
During the second revision of the Additional Articles of the Constitution in 1992, confirmation powers of its members were transferred from the Control Yuan to the Legislative Yuan, and articles related to its role as a governing body of mainland China were abolished. In 2019, the Examination Yuan was reduced from 19 members to between 7 and 9, and terms were reduced from 6 years to 4 to coincide with presidential and legislative elections.

There have been calls to abolish the Examination Yuan (and the Control Yuan) by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the Taiwan People&#x27;s Party (TPP) and New Power Party (NPP). TPP caucus whip Lai Hsiang-ling stated that members of the Examination Yuan hold &quot;fat-cat patronage appointments&quot;, whereby they earn outside income on top of their usual salary, including by teaching at universities in mainland China. Additionally, the functions of the Examination Yuan are seen as overlapping with those of the Executive Yuan, and an online poll showed about half of respondents supported its abolishment. President Tsai Ing-wen called for the two Yuans to be abolished at the DPP national congress in 2020; the Kuomintang responded by saying that it was an effort to distract from the DPP&#x27;s poor leadership, but did not provide their stance on the matter. A constitutional amendment committee was formed in September of 2020 to draft proposals for the abolition of the Examination Yuan.

== Terms ==
Appointments of the leaders and members of the Examination Yuan were carried out with presidential nomination and parliamentary confirmation. The first through eighth Examination Yuans were all confirmed by the first Control Yuan, whose members first convened in 1948 and had their terms extended indefinitely. During the democratization of Taiwan in the 1990s, a series of constitutional amendments known as the Additional Articles of the Constitution were promulgated to reorganize the government. These amendments changed the Control Yuan from a parliament chamber to a commission-type agency. Confirmation of the Examination Yuan officials was then moved to other parliament chambers to maintain the separation of powers.

Currently, according to the Additional Articles of the Constitution, the Examination Yuan is confirmed by the now-unicameral parliament — the Legislative Yuan.

<text>Membraniporidae is a bryozoan family in the order Cheilostomatida. &quot;Membranipora&quot; form encrusting or erect colonies; they are unilaminar or bilaminar and weakly to well-calcified. Zooids have vertical and basal calcified walls, but virtually no frontal calcified wall: most of the frontal surface is occupied by frontal membrane. An intertentacular organ is also present. The larvae are not brooded. The ancestrula is generally twinned. Kenozooids may be present in a few species; modified zooids analogous to avicularia are rare.

<text>Renata Scotto (24 February 1934 – 16 August 2023) was an Italian soprano, opera director, and voice teacher. Recognised for her sense of style, her musicality, and as a remarkable singer-actress, Scotto is considered to have been one of the preeminent opera singers of her generation.

For more than 40 years, she performed in some 45 roles, first in Italy, then as a leading soprano of the Metropolitan Opera (Met). She is remembered especially for the title roles of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;, performed for her stage debut in Milan in 1952, and Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, which was her first role at the Met and her last there in 1987, but also for belcanto works such as Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;. She appeared in the first telecast from the Met in 1977, as Mimi in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;, alongside Luciano Pavarotti and conducted by James Levine. She later expanded her repertoire by roles such as the Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; by Richard Strauss, Elle in Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;La voix humaine&quot;, and Madame Flora in Menotti&#x27;s &quot;The Medium&quot;. As opera director she worked for the Met, the Arena di Verona, and other leading opera houses.

== Life and career ==
Scotto was born in Savona, an industrial town and port on the Ligurian Sea, on 24 February 1934. Her father was a police officer and her mother a seamstress. During World War II, her mother took her and her sister to the nearby mountains, taking sewing jobs from the fascists, the Nazis, and the Americans. After the war, the girl experienced her first opera in her hometown, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; with Tito Gobbi in the title role, and decided then, at age twelve, that she would become an opera singer.

She studied music at the Milan Conservatory, from age 16, living in a nuns&#x27; convent, and making a living by sewing and cleaning jobs. She studied first with Emilio Ghirardini as a mezzo-soprano. She won a competition in 1952, with the prize of a debut at the Teatro Nuovo in Milan. She performed the title role of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;, first in her home town on Christmas Eve in front of a sold-out house. The next day, she made her &#x27;official&#x27; opera debut at the Teatro Nuovo.

=== Italy ===
In 1953, Scotto auditioned at La Scala for the role of Walter in Catalani&#x27;s &quot;La Wally&quot;, with Renata Tebaldi and Mario del Monaco in lead roles. After her audition, one of the judges, the conductor Victor de Sabata, was heard saying, &quot;Forget about the rest.&quot; &quot;La Wally&quot; opened on 7 December 1953, and Scotto was called back for fifteen curtain calls while Tebaldi and Del Monaco each received seven. She was offered more supporting roles at La Scala, but rejected them in favour of performing larger roles at regional houses in Italy. She appeared at the Rome Opera in 1955 as Sophie in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot;, and at La Fenice in Venice in 1956 as Traviata, and as Micaela in Bizet&#x27;s Carmen. On a recommendation by tenor Alfredo Kraus she took extra voice training with Mercedes Llopart. Kraus was to become a frequent partner on stage and for recordings. She was a member of the ensemble at La Scala from 1957, performing roles such as Donizetti Adina in &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; and Norina in &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; but was not accepted as La Traviata by Franco Zeffirelli.

Scotto&#x27;s major breakthrough came in 1957 when she performed at the Edinburgh Festival in a La Scala production of Bellini&#x27;s &quot;La Sonnambula&quot;; Maria Callas was cast as Amina, and it was so successful that the company added an unscheduled fifth performance. Callas, who was under contract for four performances, declined to perform in the added performance but allowed the La Scala management, who had announced her for the fifth performance without her consent, to explain her departure from the festival as being due to illness. Scotto, stepping in as Amina, performed on 3 September 1957, and became an international opera star at age 23.

During the 1960s she became one of the leading singers in the belcanto revival initiated by Callas during the 1950s. She sang Bellini&#x27;s Zaira and La straniera, Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Maria di Rohan&quot;, in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Robert le diable&quot;, and in other repertoire rarities. In 1964 she performed with La Scala at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, the first opera company tour to the Soviet Union during the Cold War years. In 1967 she appeared at La Scala as Giulietta in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot; and as Donizetti&#x27;s Lucia di Lammermoor, in 1969 as Gluck&#x27;s Euridice, and in 1970 as Elena in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot;.

=== United States ===
Scotto&#x27;s American debut was as Mimì in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1960. On 13 October 1965, Scotto made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Madama Butterfly, with John Alexander as Pinkerton. Louis Snyder from the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; wrote:

She went on to sing more than 300 performances in 26 roles there through 1987 and settled to live with her family in nearby Westchester County. When James Levine became chief conductor in 1971, she was granted several new roles in new productions, including Vitellia in the company&#x27;s first production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La Clemenza di Tito&quot;, in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Le prophète&quot;, and Zandonai&#x27;s Francesca da Rimini.

Scotto opened the series of Live from the Met telecasts in 1977 with &quot;La bohème&quot;, alongside Luciano Pavarotti. She starred in the telecasts of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; and &quot;Il trittico&quot;, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Luisa Miller&quot; and &quot;Don Carlo&quot;, Zandonai&#x27;s Francesca da Rimini, and as Desdemona in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;, alongside Jon Vickers, among others.

Scotto also had success at the Met as Ponchielli&#x27;s La gioconda. Moving into the heavier Verdi repertoire in the 1970s, she appeared as Elisabetta in &quot;Don Carlo&quot;, Luisa Miller, Lady Macbeth, Leonora in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, and in the &quot;Requiem&quot;, all conducted by James Levine. She is remembered as a singing actress; Plácido Domingo said in a 1978 interview: &quot;There is an emphasis, a feeling she puts behind every word she interprets.&quot;

At the performance of Bellini’s &quot;Norma&quot; which opened the Met&#x27;s 1981/1982 season, fans of Maria Callas yelled negative remarks and booed Scotto from the moment she set foot on the stage. Many were removed from the opera house by security personnel. Writing for The New Yorker, critic Andrew Porter observed, &quot;&#x27;Casta diva&quot; was a disaster. Sustained notes were often unsteady. The repeated A&#x27;s at the climax lurched over, both times, into a sharp and strident B-flat, a curdled scream. The descending scales of the cabaletta were slithers. At coloratura passages she grabbed - and missed.&quot; Critic Peter G. Davis noted in &quot;New York&quot; magazine: &quot;Time and again, Scotto reminded us of her sovereign musicality, her instinctive feeling for the rhythmic life of the notes, her ability to mold finely sculpted phrases, and her sensitivity for coloring the words into emotions that instantly define a dramatic situation.&quot;

=== Later career ===
In the late part of her career, Scotto took on the roles of Giordano&#x27;s Fedora (Barcelona, 1988), Charlotte in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot;, the Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; by Richard Strauss (Charleston Spoleto Festival, 1995 and Catania), Kundry in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot; (Schwerin, 1995), Elle in Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;La voix humaine&quot; (Maggio Musicale Fiorentino 1993, Concertgebouw, Amsterdam, and Liceu, Barcelona, 1996), Madame Flora in Menotti&#x27;s &quot;The Medium&quot; (Torino, 1999), and Klytemnestra in &quot;Elektra&quot; by Richard Strauss (Baltimore, 2000 and Sevilla, 2002).

Scotto&#x27;s later concert appearances included Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Les nuits d&#x27;été&quot;, lieder by Mahler and Richard Strauss, as well as Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Erwartung&quot; with the Accademia di Santa Cecilia Orchestra and RAI Orchestra of Torino.

=== Stage director ===
When she was about to retire from the stage, Scotto turned successfully to directing opera as well; she directed her last production of the Met of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, becoming the first woman at the house to stage an opera and star in it. Her director credits also include productions of this opera in the Arena di Verona, Florida Grand Opera, and Palm Beach Opera), Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Il pirata&quot; (Festival Belliniano, Catania, 1993) and &quot;La sonnambula&quot; (Catania, 1994); an Emmy Award-winning telecast of &quot;La traviata&quot; (New York City Opera, 1995); &quot;Norma&quot; (Finnish National Opera); &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; (Santiago, 2002); &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; (Music Hall of Thessaloniki, 2004); &quot;La Wally&quot; (Dallas Opera, Theater Bern); &quot;La bohème&quot; (Lyric Opera of Chicago, 2007 and Palm Beach Opera, 2009); &quot;Turandot&quot; (Athens, 2009); &quot;La sonnambula&quot; (Florida Grand Opera and Michigan Opera Theatre, 2008), and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; (Lyric Opera of Chicago, 2010).

=== Teaching ===
Scotto taught voice in Italy and the United States, along with academic posts at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome and the Juilliard School in New York City. She coached singers including Renée Fleming, Anna Netrebko, and Deborah Voigt.

=== Personal life ===
Scotto married Lorenzo Anselmi in 1960, who had been principal violinist at La Scala, and became her manager. The couple had a daughter and a son. Her husband died in 2021.

Scotto died in her home town of Savona on 16 August 2023, aged 89.

<text>Jean-Bosco Mwenda, also known as Mwenda wa Bayeke (1930 – September 1990), was a pioneer of Congolese fingerstyle acoustic guitar music. He was also popular in other African countries, particularly in East Africa, and in the late 1950s and early 1960s was briefly based in Nairobi, Kenya, where he had a regular radio show and became a profound influence on a generation of Kenyan guitarists.

==Background==
Jean-Bosco Mwenda was born in 1930 at Bunkeya (now part of Lualaba Province) in what was then the Belgian Congo, but lived most of his life in Lubumbashi, where in addition to playing music he had a job in a bank and with the local mining company, managed other bands, and owned a hotel on the Zambian border. He died in September 1990 in a car accident in Zambia.

Mwenda used the name Mwenda wa Bayeke, claiming descent from the Sanga noble clan of Bayeke.
His music draws on various sources including the traditional music of his Luba/Sanga people.
He was one of the few Congolese to obtain a Western education during the colonial era due to his father&#x27;s position in the Catholic Church. Mwenda worked at first as a clerk for the Likasi administration but soon achieved huge success as a guitarist, issuing his first recordings in 1952. 

Along with his friend and sometime partner Losta Abelo, and his cousin Edouard Masengo, Bosco defined the Congolese acoustic guitar style. His song &quot;Masanga&quot;, recorded by Hugh Tracey, became particularly influential, because of its complex and varied guitar part.
His own influences included traditional music of Zambia and the Eastern Congo, Cuban groups such as the Trio Matamoros, and cowboy movies.

A 1982 video field recording by Gerhard Kubik exists in a compilation of influential African guitarists artists entitled &quot;Native African Guitar&quot;. A 1982 CD with booklet (text by Gerhard Kubik, also in English, including the Kiswahili song texts), is available from the Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin. The recordings include the complete concert Bosco gave at June 30, 1982, at the Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin. In 1988 Cape Town-based record label Mountain Records recorded a studio album of Mwenda&#x27;s music and issued it in 1994. The album is entitled &quot;Mwenda wa Bayeke - African guitar legend&quot;.

<doc id="378830" wikidata="Q829842" url="?curid=378830" title="Forssa">
<text>Forssa is a town and municipality of Finland. It is located almost in the centre of a triangle defined by the three largest major cities in Finland (Helsinki, Turku and Tampere), in the Tavastia Proper region, and which is crossed by Highway 2 between Pori and Helsinki and Highway 10 between Turku and Hämeenlinna. The town has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . Only a little part of the surface area of Forssa is water, but the river Loimijoki forms an important element in the cityscape, with the city being located at its starting point. Other notable water areas in Forssa include the lake Kaukjärvi and the lake Koijärvi, known as the birthplace of the Green League.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish. However, the name Forssa comes from the Swedish word &quot;fors&quot;, meaning rapids.

Forssa is the central locality of the Forssa sub-region. The city is bordered with Jokioinen to the west, Tammela to the east and south and Humppila and Urjala to the north. As well as Forssa, the Forssa sub-region includes Jokioinen, Tammela, Humppila and Ypäjä. Forssa is the smallest of the three cities in Tavastia Proper, with a population of about 16,500, and in terms of population Forssa is the 67th largest municipality in Finland. The population in Forssa has concentrated on the Forssa central conurbation in the southern part of the municipality, which also spreads over to the municipalities of Jokioinen and Tammela. The area of the former municipality of Koijärvi in the northern part of the city is a sparsely populated rural area.

Forssa grew and developed in the 19th century when the textile industry grew. In the 20th century the city barely grew at all between the two World wars. A new growth phase began in the 1960s, sped by construction industry. The population of Forssa was as its highest in the middle 1980s when the city had a bit over 20 thousand inhabitants for two years. The growth of the city since stopped as the industry started diminishing. By 1994 the population had decreased by a few hundred people, but after that the decrease in population grew. By late 2005 Forssa had lost over two thousand people compared to its highest point. In 2008 the population of Forssa increased for the first time since 1993. After 2010 population has again decreased, with the population in 2016 being about 17,300. Today the food industry is a notable employer.

The location of Forssa, in the middle of the triangle formed by the cities of Helsinki, Turku and Tampere, is sometimes seen as ideal, as commute trips to the largest cities in the country are fast. The distance to Helsinki is 110 kilometres, the distance to Tampere is 87 kilometres and the distance to Turku is 88 kilometres.

==History==
The development of Forssa into an industrial conurbation started when industrialist Axel Wilhelm Wahren founded a spinning mill on the shore of the river Loimijoki in 1847. Today the Forssa industrial community has been classified as a notable constructed cultural environment in Finland.

In 1903 a party meeting of the Finnish Workers&#x27; Party, known as the Forssa meeting, was held in Forssa, where the party was renamed as the Social Democratic Party of Finland and a new party program was accepted into use.

Forssa only became an independent municipality in 1923 when it was separated from the municipality of Tammela into its own market town. Forssa received city privileges in 1964. The depression in the early 1990s had a large impact on Forssa, resulting in economic problems and an unemployment rate that still remains high today.

===Coat of arms===

The current coat of arms of Forssa was designed by Olof Eriksson in 1962. Its heraldic description reads: &quot;A silver waterwheel on a blue shield&quot;. The coat of arms depicts water power and the river Loimijoki running through the city. The coat of arms was taken into use on 29 August 1962.

The former coat of arms of Forssa was designed by Arne Wilhelm Rancken in 1947. The coat of arms had a wavy division with a silver waterwheel on a blue background at the bottom part, and three blue wavy lines and a red letter F on a silver background at the top part. This coat of arms was later discontinued as unheraldic.

==Population==
The population development in Forssa from 1847 to 1990 has been researched in the 1995 annual of the Homestead and museum association of Southwestern Tavastia and in the book &quot;Forssan historia&quot; by Risto O. Peltovuori, published in 1993. After Forssa became an independent municipality in 1923, its population in 1925 was 7,681. The development of population was modest until 1945; at that time the population was 8,045. After this, the increase in population sped up: Forssa reached 9,000 inhabitants in 1952, 10,000 inhabitants in 1957, 11,000 inhabitants in 1962, 12,000 inhabitants in 1966 and 13,000 inhabitants in 1968 with a population of 13,157. The annexation of Koijärvi to Forssa in 1969 raised the population to over 15,000. In 1971 the Lempää area of about 9 square kilometres was annexed to Forssa from Tammela, raising the population by about a hundred.

Forssa grew rapidly in the 1970s, but in the middle 1980s this growth stopped. The city population was at its highest at 20,074 in late 1985. After the middle 1990s the population of the city and of the entire region started to decrease rapidly. From 2005 to 2010 the population settled at about 17,900 people, but after that it started to decrease again with the population at late 2016 being about 17,300.

90 percent of the population of Forssa live in the urban central conurbation of Forssa, where population is dense. In the rural areas in central and northern Forssa both the population and the population density are low. The Forssa central conurbation also reaches over to Jokioinen and Tammela. Of the entire population of the Forssa region, the population of Forssa proper is about one half.

Population concentration spots of the Forssa industrial community are the Kalliomäki wooden house area to the north of the river Loimijoki and the wooden house areas of Vanha Kuhala, Uusikylä and Yliskylä to the south of the river. Throughout the decades, new city districts have been built around this historical centre. The Viksberg apartment building suburb was mostly built in the 1970s and the suburb of Tölö in the 1970s and 1980s, but their population has been decreasing. Recently the population has increased in the city outskirts through construction of detached houses and also in the city centre through construction of apartment buildings.

In late 2011, about 13.5 percent of the population of Forssa belonged to the age bracket of 0 to 14 years, 63.2 percent to the bracket of 15 to 64 years and 23.3 percent to the bracket of over 64 years. In the long run, both the absolute number and the proportion of children have significantly decreased. The elderly are the only age group to increase in either absolute number or proportion. In 1997 the number of children fell below the number of the elderly.

Most of the children live in new small house areas on the edge of the central conurbation. Most of the elderly live in Korkeavaha and the city centre, where the proportion of people of 64 years or older is 40 percent.

From 1980 to 2010 the language distribution in Forssa has remained fairly stable. The absolute number of Finnish language speakers has decreased by about 1,900 people, but the proportion has only decreased by a little from 99.6 percent to 97.1 percent. The number of Swedish language speakers has decreased by about a third. The most significant increase has been in the group of people speaking other languages than Finnish or Swedish, which has increased manifold.

===Congregations===

In 2023, the Evangelical Lutheran Church was the largest religious group with 70.9% of the population of Forssa. Other religious groups accounted for 2.3% of the population. 26.8% of the population had no religious affiliation.

According to the 2018 division Forssa includes its own congregation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. The former congregation of Koijärvi was annexed to the congregation of Forssa in 2007. The city has an activity centre of the Hämeenlinna Orthodox congregation, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses Kingdom Hall, a Pentecostal Salem church and activity of the Evangelical Free Church of Finland. The Evangelical Free Church has its premises in the &quot;Kerhola&quot; building commissioned by the Forssa company. Forssa also has a cemetery of the Union of Freethinkers of Finland.

The Pentecostal Church of Finland has its own congregation in Forssa and the Evangelical Free Church of Finland also has its own free congregation in Forssa.

==Geography==
===Development of population===
====From 1847 to 1946====
The first planned constructed areas in Forssa were Wahreninkatu and the buildings at Viksberg. Kalliomäki with its lines was born starting from the 1870s after Wahren had ordered a zoning plan in the area. In addition to Kalliomäki, the oldest inhabited areas in Forssa include Vanha Kuhala to the south of the river Loimijoki, Uusikylä between Rautatienkatu and Räynynoja and Yliskylä, also known as &quot;Ameriikka&quot;, slightly to the west of Uusikylä.

According to Helga Keränen&#x27;s 1930 research, the market town of Forssa was divided into ten physiognomical areas, including the Kalliomäki area, the greater population area of Hämeentie, the Puisto area, the Forssa industrial area, the Viksberg industrial area, the Forssa business centre, the smaller population area of Keski-Forssa, &quot;Amerikka&quot; and the new population area of Yliskylä. This division only concerned the tightly built areas in Forssa, not the rural areas around them.

Until 1946, the area of tightly-built wooden houses was fairly small compared to the conurbated area of today. A large part of the currently populated areas were still fields. As well as the aforementioned areas, there was inhabitation in Kekkala, a little in Pispanmäki and some buildings on the lands of the Viksberg manor. The construction of Rantalanmäki had already started at this point.

====From the 1950s to the 1980s====
New apartment buildings were built at the Kartanonkatu and Forssa market square area, as well as Viksberg, in the 1960s. Many old wooden buildings were dismantled to make way for new construction. Afterwards, the dismantling of many old buildings has been met with criticism. Perhaps the most famous dismantled building was the &quot;Gingerbread House&quot; located at the intersection between Säästöpankinkatu and Hämeentie. Construction of new apartment buildings continued in the 1970s, when construction of Tölö started, new red brick apartment buildings were built along Pekolanraitti and construction of Viksberg continued.

The expanding industry in the city spread to the lands of the old Viksberg manor. Parma constructed its element factory and Ahlström built its steel wool factory at Pispanmäki to the west of National Road 2.

Small house areas slowly spread to the edges of the city. After Talsoila, new detached houses were built in the north at Lamminranta, Ojalanmäki, Kaikula and Vieremä. Construction of Paavola started in the 1980s and today the area is almost completely built up. Paavola hosted the Asuntomessut apartment fair in 1982.

====From the 1990s to today====
Expansion of Forssa has been fairly slow, as the decrease of population has also led to a decrease in demand for new apartments. However, some new detached houses have been constructed. Most of the new houses are located in Kuusto in the eastern part of the city, and some are located in Pikkumuolaa, Paavola and the northwestern part of Vieremä. During the last couple of years, some new apartment buildings have been built in Makasiiniranta.

===Bodies of water===
Of the total surface area of Forssa only 4.61 square kilometres are bodies of water, which is 1.8 percent of the total surface area. In the central conurbation area, the only bodies of water are part of lake Kaukjärvi in the east, the river Loimijoki flowing through the city, the nearly filled-up lake Loimalammi flowing to the river, lake Linikkalanlammi in Linikkala and lake Mäkilammi in Vieremä. The largest lake in the region is lake Pyhäjärvi in neighbouring Tammela.

The river Jänhijoki, a side river of Loimijoki, flows through the central parts of the area of dispersed settlement in Forssa. Bodies of water at the river&#x27;s starting point include the lakes Kiimalammi and Luomalammi, located in the north near the border of Tammela, belonging to the chain of small forest lakes in Mustiala in Tammela.

The bird lake of Koijärvi is located in the northern part of the area of dispersed settlement. The river Koijoki (also known as Kojonjoki or Koenjoki), the largest side river of Loimijoki, starts at the lake, flowing past Matku to the west along the border to Jokioinen and Humppila. Another starting lake of this river is Valijärvi near the border to Tammela. Bodies of water near Pyhäjärvi in Tammela include lake Lunkinjärvi near the border to Tammela. Near the border to Urjala, bodies of water partly located in Forssa at the starting point of the river Tarpianjoki flowing through Urjala included the lakes of Kokonjärvi, Särkijärvi and Matkunjärvi.

===Parks===

There are 110 parks in Forssa, with a combined area of 303 hectares. Some of the most notable parks include:
* Ankkalammi park: Located to the south of the market square. The park was renewed during the renovation of the market square.
* Yhtiönpuisto park: A park located near the old spinning mill, sometimes also referred to as the Wahren park.
* Central park: The next natural park along the river Loimijoki after the Yhtiönpuisto park, also has a football field.
* Talsoila park: A partly built, partly natural park in Talsoila, made as a public park open to everyone in contrast to the previously closed Yhtiönpuisto park.
* Rantapuisto park: A park located opposite the Central park on the river shore in Rantalanmäki.
* Harjupuisto park: A forest park with pine trees, on the border between Kaikula and Vieremä.
* Mäkilammi park: A forest park with pine trees, bordering Mäkilammi in Vieremä.
* Lamminranta park: A park around Lamminranta.
* Paavola park: A partly built, partly forest park in the district of Paavola.
* Siurila park: A park in the centre of the Viksberg residential area, with two ponds, an artificial brook and a fountain.
* Salmistonmäki and Loimalammi: A natural area located at the eastern park of Haudankorva right next to the border to Tammela.
Many of the parks are natural greenspaces and not actively tended &quot;parade parks&quot;.

====National urban park====
The city of Forssa has been built on area alternating between forest and field landscapes. Three areas in the city have received the position of a national urban park.
* The Haudankorva and Kuusto field areas as &quot;agrarian landscape&quot; areas
* The old industrial buildings and some old districts (such as Kalliomäki, Kuhala and Rantalanmäki) as &quot;industrial heritage&quot; areas
* Hunnari in Vieremä, the area next to the cemetery in Kaikula and the area around the pond in Lamminranta as &quot;esker areas&quot;.

===Climate===
Forssa has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;)
===Transport===
====Transport connections====
Roads passing through the centre of Forssa include:
* Finnish national road 2 from Helsinki via Forssa to Pori
* Finnish national road 10 from Turku via Forssa to Hämeenlinna
* Finnish regional road 282 from Somero to Forssa
* Finnish regional road 284 from Urjala via the Koijärvi church to Forssa
* Finnish connecting road 2804 from the centre of Jokioinen to Forssa (named &quot;Jokioistentie&quot; in Forssa)
* Finnish connecting road 2821 from the centre of Tammela to Forssa (named &quot;Tammelantie&quot; in Forssa, also known as &quot;Tammelansuora&quot;)

The poor condition of national road 2 has been seen as a factor slowing down the development of Forssa. The highways starting from Helsinki have been changed to controlled-access highways, but the national road 2, with a smaller amount of traffic, is still a conventional two-laned highway. The national road 2 was improved in the vicinity of Forssa from 2006 to 2009 by building the new Paavola bridge and a bypass lane in Jokioinen, which also serves as a reserve landing strip for the Finnish Air Force.

The Turku–Toijala railway passes through Matku, but the trains no longer stop there, and the old station building in Matku has been dismantled. The railway structures in the centre of Forssa were dismantled in the 1970s and the city thus no longer has railway connections of its own. The nearest passenger traffic station is in Humppila. There have been suggestions for building a railway to the city. These suggestions have included a railway from Helsinki via Forssa and Humppila to Pori. This project could be started in the middle 2020s at the earliest. Another suggestion is the construction of a railway from Riihimäki via Forssa to Loimaa.

The Forssa Airfield is located in the district of Haudankorva and is used for hobby aviation. The nearest airports for commercial passenger aviation are located in Helsinki, Tampere and Turku.

====Internal transport====
The transport in the centre of Forssa has been seen as problematic. For example the Kauppakatu street was forbidden for heavy-duty car transport in early 2008. There have also been long-time plans for a so-called &quot;Eastern beltway&quot;, which would allow traffic to bypass the city centre of Forssa from national road 2 to national road 10 and possibly onwards to Tampereentie. As a part of this plan, the street Loimalammintie was built as new southern entryway to the city and the connection from Helsingintie, the previous entryway, to national road 2 was removed.

There have been plans for an extension of the Yhtiönkatu street from the current end of Yhtiönkatu to the start of Tampereentie, along line I past the church, for decades. The planned street was marked into the zoning plan in 1969, and there is a new street connection between Yhtiönkatu and Tampereentie in the new regional plan. The zoning plan is seen as outdated, and there have been frequent discussions about renewing it. There has been support both for various solutions about constructing a road connection and for leaving the street unbuilt. The project has been very controversial, and sometimes there has been much discussion about it in the readers&#x27; column in the &quot;Forssan Lehti&quot; newspaper. The administrative law court of Hämeenlinna rejected the plan for the area including the street and Forssa complained about this decision, but the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland rejected this complaint.

There have also been plans for a renovation of the Kartanonkatu street for a long time. Renovation of the street started in July 2012 and was completed in late 2012. Failures in speed bump construction had to be repaired for several times.

==Districts==
In statistics related to basic statistical units, the city of Forssa is divided into three major districts, twenty statistical districts and thirty minor districts. The three major districts are &quot;Keskustaajama&quot; (the part of the central conurbation going over the municipal boundaries and its surrounding countryside), &quot;Parkkiaro&quot; (a rural area in the middle of Forssa) and &quot;Entinen Koijärvi&quot; (the core areas of the former municipality of Koijärvi). The villages of Kokko and Matku, partly annexed to Urjala, are not part of the Entinen Koijärvi major district. On the other hand, the southern part of the statistical district of Kojo, part of the major district, was not part of the municipality of Koijärvi but instead the market town of Forssa. The statistical district of Kojo also includes the Lempää area, formerly part of the municipality of Tammela.

The districts according to the basic statistical units are not necessarily exactly the same as the districts according to the National Land Survey of Finland, because the statistical units can include for example areas classified in the country register. In articles about districts they have been identified with the correspondingly named statistical units. The name of the statistical unit differs from the name of the district in two cases, where the name given by the National Land Survey is used:
* The Kuhala district is the Tölö statistical unit
* The Linikkala district is the Kalliomäki statistical unit
Also the name of Pikku-Muolaa is often spelled &quot;Pikkumuolaa&quot;.

===The Keskustaajama major district===
The 16 districts in the Keskustaajama major district are listed alphabetically here. The numbers in parentheses are the official order numbers of the National Land Survey.
* Haudankorva (6.)
* Järvenpää (11.)
* Kaikula (9.)
* Keskusta (1.)
* Kivimäki (10.)
* Korkeavaha (4.)
* Kuhala (7.)

* Paavola (15.)
* Pikku-Muolaa (13.)
* Pispanmäki (14.)
* Talsoila (8.)
* Vieremä (16.)

===The Parkkiaro major district===
The district of Parkkiaro forms a major district by itself, and is one of the districts (statistical units) of Forssa. The number in parentheses is an official number of the National Land Survey.
* Parkkiaro (17.)

===The Entinen Koijärvi major district===
The major district of Entinen Koijärvi consists of three statistical units, which are not considered as districts.
* Kojo (477 inhabitants) consists of the central area of the former municipality of Koijärvi. Kojo includes the former church area of Koijärvi, which does not constitute a conurbation. The Koijärvi church and the Kojo school are located in Kojo.
* Matku (523 inhabitants) is located in the western part of the former municipality of Koijärvi. The railway between Turku and Toijala goes through Forssa at the district of Matku, which was formerly its own conurbation. Matku is no longer considered a conurbation after its population fell below 200. The Matku railway station has been dismantled and there has not been station traffic in the area for a long time.
* Suonpää (217 inhabitants) consists of the northern areas of the former municipality of Koijärvi.

==Villages==
The land register villages listed here do not have borders conforming to the borders of the districts or statistical units listed above. The villages are divided based on whether they were part of the Forssa market town or the municipality of Koijärvi before the 1969 annexation. The numbers in parentheses after the names are index numbers announced by the National Land Survey.

===Forssa market town area===
Villages located in the Forssa market town area were:
* Haudankorva (401)
* Järvenpää (402)
* Kuhala (405)
* Kuusto (406)
* Linikkala (408)
* Lunttila (409)
* Talsoila (413)
* Vieremä (414)

===Koijärvi area===

* Kojo (403)
* Kokko (404)
* Kölli (407)
* Matku (410)
* Menonen (411)
* Raitoo (412)

===Inconsistencies with the municipal division===
The area of the former market town of Forssa also contains parts of the villages of Jokioinen (415) and Kaukjärvi (416), but these villages are mainly located in the neighbouring municipalities of Jokioinen and Tammela. However, Tammela also contains parts of the villages of Haudankorva, Linikkala and Lunttila, but these villages are mainly located in Forssa.

Likewise, of the villages located in the former municipality of Koijärvi, Kojo is partly located in Tammela and Matku is partly located in Urjala. In the annexation, the village of Kojo was mainly annexed to Urjala and the village of Menonen is also partly located in Urjala.

==Urban areas==
In late 2017 Forssa had a population of 17,185, of which 15,518 lived in urban areas, 1,511 in sparsely populated areas and 156 at unknown locations. The proportion of urban areas in Forssa is 91.1%. The municipality has only one urban area, the Forssa central urban area. In addition to Forssa, the central urban area spreads over to the municipalities of Jokioinen and Tammela. The Forssa central urban area has a total population of 21,236 and a surface area of 37,14 square kilometres.

==Politics==

Up to the 1992 election, Forssa has had a characteristic left-wing majority in its city council. In parliamentary elections, Forssa has been historically a left-wing majority municipality, and in elections from 1983 to 2011 SDP has been the largest party up to 2007, when it fell to second place. Also in presidential elections the SDP candidate has received the most votes.

Today the Parliament of Finland has one member from Forssa:
* Sanni Grahn-Laasonen (National Coalition Party), member of parliament since 2011, minister of the environment from 2014 to 2015, minister of education and culture from 2015 to 2017, minister of education from 2017 to 2019.

===Employment structure===
In 2009 Forssa had 8,724 jobs, which were divided among the business sectors as follows:
* agriculture and forestry: 184 (2.1%)
* secondary sector: 2,953 (33.8%)
* services: 5,530 (63.4%)
* unknown: 57 (0.7%)

The secondary sector of the economy is still a significant business, but its proportion of the jobs has decreased noticeably. The proportion of the secondary sector was at its highest at 55.7% in 1975. The total number of jobs in Forssa had also decreased, the number of jobs was at its highest at 11,000 in 1990. During the early 1990s depression in Finland, the city lost about 2,000 jobs by 1995. Agriculture is practised in Forssa mainly in the area of the former municipality of Koijärvi.

The textile industry started by Wahren in the 19th century was the largest employer in the city up to the 1970s. After this, the construction industry rose to the largest industry thanks to the increase of activity of the company Rakennusvalmiste Oy founded by Armas Puolimatka. The third mineral wool factory of A. Ahlström (now known as Saint-Gobain Isover) was officially inaugurated at Pilvenmäki on 13 Octobner 1971. The factory had been undergoing test runs for a month before this.

Today the food industry is the largest industry in Forssa. HK Ruokatalo Oy has concentrated a large part of its activity in Forssa. The company Atria also has activities in the city after it bought the local company Liha ja Säilyke. The product label Forssan still remains on the market. The meat refinery company Hakala Oy represents the local food industry.

<text>Ii (; ) is a municipality of Finland. It is situated by the Bothnian Bay, at the mouth of river Iijoki, and it is part of the Northern Ostrobothnia region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

Ii merged with Kuivaniemi on 1 January 2007. The new municipality retained the name Ii, but adopted the coat of arms of Kuivaniemi.

Beginning in 2008, Ii is home to the ART Ii Biennale of Northern Environmental and Sculpture Art, an international art fair.

The city has ambition to become the first zero waste town in the world, and its municipal manager claims that it does not use fossil fuels for energy.

== Etymology ==
Ii is notable for having the shortest place name in Finland, and also one of the shortest ones in the world. The etymology is not definitively established; options are either Germanic origin or Sami origin. In the latter, it would mean &quot;a place to stay overnight in&quot;; cf. Northern Sami &quot;&quot; &quot;night&quot;.

== History ==
Ii is named after the river Iijoki. The original name of the settlement was &quot;Iijoen kylä&quot;, first mentioned in 1374 as &quot;Yioki&quot; when it was a chapel community within the Pedersöre parish. The marketplace &quot;Iin Hamina&quot; has existed since the 14th century. Ii became a separate parish sometime before 1445.

The parish of Ii was originally larger than the modern municipality: it included Pudasjärvi and Taivalkoski until 1639, Kiiminki, Ylikiiminki and Haukipudas until 1858. The municipality of Kuivaniemi was split off in 1919 and Yli-Ii was split off in 1924.

Kuivaniemi became a part of Ii again in 2007. When Yli-Ii was merged into Oulu, a part of it was given to Ii as an exclave. This exclave contains the Pahkakoski hydroelectric power plant.

The village of Jakkukylä and its surroundings, originally part of Yli-Ii and a part of Oulu from 2013, decided to join Ii in 2018.

<doc id="378834" wikidata="Q698027" url="?curid=378834" title="Greater Poland uprising (1918–1919)">
<text>The Greater Poland uprising of 1918–1919, or Wielkopolska uprising of 1918–1919 (; ) or Poznań War was a military insurrection of Poles in the Greater Poland region (German: Grand Duchy of Posen or Provinz Posen) against German rule. The uprising had a significant effect on the Treaty of Versailles, which granted a reconstituted Second Polish Republic the area won by the Polish insurrectionists. The region had been part of the Kingdom of Poland and then Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth before the 1793 Second Partition of Poland when it was annexed by the German Kingdom of Prussia. It had also, following the 1806 Greater Poland uprising, been part of the Duchy of Warsaw (1807–1815), a French client state during the Napoleonic Wars.

==Background==
After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Poland had ceased to exist as an independent state. From 1795 through the beginning of World War I, several unsuccessful uprisings to regain independence took place. The Great Poland Uprising of 1806 was followed by the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw, which lasted for eight years before it was partitioned again between Prussia and Russia. Under German rule, Poles faced systematic discrimination and oppression. The Poles living in the region of Greater Poland were subjected to Germanisation and land confiscations to make way for German colonization.

At the end of World War I, US President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points and the idea of national self-determination were met with opposition from European powers standing to lose influence or territory, such as Germany, which dominated Greater Poland. German politicians had signed an armistice leading to a ceasefire on 11 November 1918. Also, Germany had signed the with Bolshevik Russia to settle the territorial boundaries of the eastern frontiers. That treaty took into consideration of a future Polish state and so from then until the Treaty of Versailles was fully ratified in January 1920 many territorial and sovereignty issues remained unresolved.

Wilson&#x27;s proposal for an independent Poland initially did not set borders that could be universally accepted. Most of Poland that was partitioned and annexed to Prussia in the late 18th-century was still part of Greater Germany at the close of World War I, the rest of the Kingdom of Poland being in Austria-Hungary. The portion in Germany included the region of Greater Poland, of which Poznań (Posen) was a major industrial city and its capital. The majority of the population was Polish (more than 60%) and hoped to be within the borders of the new Polish state.

=== Military contact between Poznan and Warsaw ===
Throughout the month of November, the Polish army sought to recruit Poles from the region into its military. At the same time, they also held talks with Poznan to organize proper relations between Poznan and Warsaw and to prepare for an armed uprising. Jozef Pilsudski and his government did not intend to enter armed conflict with Germany, this being a major point of disagreement between the two groups, and did not believe any attempts at armed rebellion would work, convinced that only the Entente could grant Poland this region. However, he included it in his plans to rebuild the country and treated it as a part of Poland, it being historically Polish. On 28 October 1918, Major Włodzimierz Zagórski, as Deputy Head of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces, established a dedicated command in Kalisz wherein a department of affairs related to Greater Poland was set up. A military regiment was set up in Ostrow, the city being held by the Ostrow People&#x27;s Council, however it was soonafter dissolved and it&#x27;s members were sent to Kalisz. To the dismay of the Poles, the Ostrow People&#x27;s Council addressed a letter to the Supreme Command in Kalisz, renouncing military cooperation, claiming that it only recognises the Commissariat of the Supreme People’s Council on 17 November. Nevertheless, the Poznan Central Citizens&#x27; Committee delegated Celestyn Rydlewski to visit the Polish General Staff. He suggested conscripting Polish citizens of the Prussian Partition into the Polish Armed Forces. 800 or so were sent into Poland as a result.

==Uprising==
In late 1918, Poles hoping for a sovereign Poland started serious preparations for an uprising after abdication on 9 November 1918, which marked the end of the German Empire. The monarchy was replaced by the Weimar Republic.

The uprising broke out on 27 December 1918 in Poznań, after a patriotic speech by Ignacy Paderewski, the famous pianist, who would become the Polish prime minister in 1919, with 2,000 men serving in the Guard and Security Service rising up in the city.

The insurrectionist forces consisted of members of the Polish Military Organization, who formed the (Citizen&#x27;s Guard), later renamed as (People&#x27;s Guard), which included many volunteers, who were mainly veterans of World War I. The first contingent to reach the Bazar Hotel, from where the uprising was initiated, was a 100-strong force from (Wilda&#x27;s People&#x27;s Guard) led by Antoni Wysocki. The ruling body was the (Supreme People&#x27;s Council). Initially, the members of the council, including Captain Stanisław Taczak and General Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki were against the uprising, but they changed their minds in support of the insurrection on 9 January 1919.

The timing was advantageous for the insurrectionists since between late 1918 and early 1919, internal conflict had weakened Germany, and many of its soldiers and sailors engaged in mutinous actions against the state. Demoralized by the signing of the armistice on 11 November 1918, the new German government was further embroiled in subduing the German Revolution.
By 15 January 1919, Poles had taken control of most of the province, and they engaged in heavy fighting with the regular German army and irregular units such as the Grenzschutz. Fighting continued until the renewal of the truce between the Entente and Germany on 16 February. The truce also affected the front line in Greater Poland, but despite the ceasefire, skirmishes continued until the final signing of the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919.

The uprising is one of the two most successful Polish uprisings, the other being the Great Poland uprising of 1806, which ended with the entry of Napoleon&#x27;s army on the side of the Poles fighting against Prussia.

Many of the Greater Poland insurrectionists later took part in the Silesian Uprisings against German rule, which started in late 1919 and ended in 1921.

==Appraisal==

The uprising had a significant effect on the decisions in Versailles that granted Poland not only the area won by the insurrectionists but also major cities with a significant German population like Bydgoszcz (Bromberg), Leszno (Lissa) and Rawicz (Rawitsch), as well as the lands of the Polish Corridor, which were also part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth before the First Partition of Poland in 1772 and connected Poland to the Baltic Sea.

Germany&#x27;s territorial losses following the Treaty of Versailles incited German revanchism, and created unresolved problems such as the status of the independent Free City of Danzig and of the Polish Corridor between East Prussia and the rest of Germany. This revanchism was not a popular political idea in the Weimar Republic. Attending to these issues was part of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s political platform, but failed to gain any traction in the 1920s. The idea was relegated to the political margins, until the Nazis seized power.

Nevertheless, Nazi Germany effectively recognised Poland&#x27;s new borders in the German–Polish declaration of non-aggression of 1934, which normalised relations between the two countries. However, after the death of Polish leader Józef Piłsudski (who was admired by Hitler), the German &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Austria and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Hitler unilaterally withdrew from the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and invaded Poland in 1939, which led to the outbreak of World War II.

== Aftermath ==

=== Remembrance ===
The Greater Poland uprising was not remembered as well as the January Uprising or the Warsaw Uprising in Polish history and popular culture, despite it being the only one of the three uprisings cited that succeeded. This was due to three factors, the first due to it being an uprising that didn&#x27;t apply to Polish tradition. There were no major icons of the uprising, no heroes, no real martyrs. The uprising couldn&#x27;t be passed down by generations as a heroic fight to the death, no, it was simply a military operation that pushed the Germans out of a section of the Prussian Partition. Secondly, the fighters of the uprising were not engaged for the whole uprising and many of them did not find themselves part of any actual fighting group. Many part of the original uprisings simply took up arms, liberated their towns and by sundown they had eaten dinner and went back to civilian life. Thirdly, there were very few casualties. Though this shows the brilliance of the operation, few perished or were wounded at the hands of the Germans. On 23 December 2021, Polish President Andrzej Duda declared 27 December as a National Holiday, commemorating this uprising.

===Epilogue===
* 24 March 2005: the last surviving Polish fighter in the uprising, Lieutenant Jan Rzepa, dies at the age of 106.

<text>Kajaani (; ), historically known as Cajanaburg (), is a town in Finland and the regional capital of Kainuu. Kajaani is located southeast of Lake Oulu, which drains into the Gulf of Bothnia through the Oulu River. The population of Kajaani is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland.

The town was founded in the 17th century, fueled by the growth of the tar industry, but it was preceded by a long history of settlements. During the Great Northern War it succumbed to Russian forces, who ruined Kajaani Castle in 1716. Today, the local economy is mainly driven by the sawmill, lumber, and paper industries, although UPM Kymmene&#x27;s paper mill, the main employer from 1907 until 2008, has since closed. Kajaani&#x27;s church was built in 1896 in the Neo-Gothic style by the architect Jac Ahrenberg to replace an earlier church. Kajaani&#x27;s town theatre was established in 1969.

Kajaani is home to two football clubs, AC Kajaani and Kajaanin Haka, and the ice hockey team Hokki. The Kajaani University of Applied Sciences was established in 1992. Kajaani is also home to LUMI, the &quot;fastest supercomputer in the EU&quot;, which is located on the former paper mill site of UPM.

==History==

Kajaani was one of the cities founded on 6 March 1651 by the Swedish Governor General of Finland, Per Brahe. At that time, the Kainuu region—as wood country—was an important producer of tar derived from pine, and the tar trade was its major industry. In 1653-4 the district court sessions of Kajaani and Sotkamo were responsible for authorizing a road to be built between Säräisniemi and Raahe, improving communications in the region.

During the Greater Wrath in the 18th century, Kajaani Castle was forced to surrender to Russian forces. The Russians blew the castle up in March 1716, and it has been in ruins ever since. On 17 October 1808, General Johan August Sandels won a key victory to the south of Kajaani near Iisalmi during the Battle of Koljonvirta of the Finnish War, when his army of just 1,800 defeated over 6,000 Russians. There is a monument on the east side of the river marking where the spot where Lieutenant Jakob Henrik Zidén and Major-General Mikhail Petrovich Dolgorukov fell.

In early 1833, medical doctor Elias Lönnrot, best known for compiling the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the national epic of Finland, was appointed district physician in Kajaani and was assigned to assist in dealing with the typhoid and cholera epidemic which was raging during the 1830s. The disease was difficult to treat and he soon fell ill himself with typhus at the end of February 1833 but recovered. Kajaani was severely affected by the famine in 1867-1868 which devastated much of Finland, but the town gradually recovered and by the end of the century had grown to more than 1200 inhabitants. Kajaani Town Hall was built in 1831, the former City Library in 1852, Kainuu&#x27;s first elementary school in 1883, and Kajaani Church in 1896 as it grew into a notable settlement.

The paper industry took off in Kajaani in the early 20th century in particular. Kajaani Paper Mill was built in 1907 and was run by the firm Kajaani Oy, which had a capital of FMK 5,000,000 (£137,615) in 1948. Kajaani Oy was eventually acquired by Valmet in 1983, and the subsidiary Kajaani Electronics was formed. Ämmäkoski power plant was built on the river in 1917 by the Kajaani Lumber Company, and underwent alterations under architect Eino Pitkänen in the 1940s.

The city&#x27;s grew in the 1960s to 14,600 inhabitants. Industrial development in the 1970s, and the merger of the separate rural municipality of Kajaani, Kajaanin maalaiskunta, and the city in 1977 saw the population jump to 34,574 by 1980. Vuolijoki was consolidated with Kajaani at the beginning of 2007.

In 2012, an oil spill occurred in Kajaani. 110,000 liters of oily water leaked into a river that eventually flowed into the Oulujärvi lake.

==Geography==

Kajaani is situated in the heart of central Finland. By road is it north-northwest of Helsinki, north of Kuopio, and southeast of Oulu. Villages in the vicinity include Jormua, Koutaniemi, Kuluntalahti, Lahnasjärvi, Lehtovaara, Linnantaus, Mainua, Murtomäki and Paltaniemi. Districts of Kajaani include: Heinisuo, Hetteenmäki, Hoikankangas, Huuhkajanvaara, Katiska, Kettu, Komiaho, Kuurna, Kylmä, Kättö, Kätönlahti, Laajankangas, Lehtikangas, Lohtaja, Nakertaja, Onnela, Palokangas, Petäisenniska, Puistola, Purola, Soidinsuo, Suvantola, Teppana, Tihisenniemi, Tikkapuro, Variskangas and Yläkaupunki.

Kajaani lies on the Kajaani River, between the lakes of Oulujärvi, which drains to the Gulf of Bothnia along the Oulu River, and Nuasjärvi. Between Kajaani and Oulujärvi are the smaller lakes of Sokajärvi and Paltajärvi, which are frozen during winter. Paltajärvi stands between the Kajaani River and Oulujärvi. The Kajaani and Vuolijoki rivers are noted for their fishing. The island of Käkisaari lies on lake Oulujärvi to the northwest of the town and features residential houses and about 150 summer cottages and holiday apartments, and the island of Toukka lies in the eastern part of the lake. Also within the municipality is the Laakajärvi, a lake with a maximum depth of , which is a notable nesting area for Great black-backed gull and ospreys.

The surrounding area is dominated by mainly conifer forest, with broad-leafed birch and alder woods on some of the steeper banks and streams.

<text>Kemi (; ; ; ) is a town and municipality of Finland. It is located very near the city of Tornio and the Swedish border.

==History==
===World War II hostage crisis===

During World War II, after Finland signed the Moscow Armistice and found itself involved in the Lapland War against its former German ally, German forces at the beginning of October 1944 captured 132 Finnish civilian hostages in Kemi (as well as 130 in Rovaniemi) and threatened to kill them unless the Finnish army released the German POWs captured in the Battle of Tornio. However, Finland refused to comply and threatened to retaliate by killing the German POWs. The hostages were released unharmed on October 11, 1944, near Rovaniemi.

== Geography ==
Kemi is situated on the Bothnian Bay, at the mouth of the river Kemijoki, and it is part of the Lapland region.

===Climate===
The climate type of Kemi is a typical subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;). It is characterized by long, cold winters and warm, short summers; but because it is on the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, the characteristics of its continental climate are not as pronounced as inland areas.


====Note====
==Economy==

The main economic activity in Kemi is centered on two large paper and woodpulp mills and on the only chromium mine in Europe (which supplies the Outokumpu ferrochrome plant in Tornio).

In April 2007, the city of Kemi laid off all of its municipal workers for two weeks due to the failing economy of the city. Spiraling specialist healthcare costs and a fleeing industry tax base are stated as the cause for the firing. These are the most drastic temporary dismissals to take place in Finland since 2000.
== Sights ==

Kemi has a claim to fame as the home of the world&#x27;s largest snow castle (reconstructed every year to a different design). The SnowCastle of Kemi is usually built in the inner harbor of the city.

A model of The Crown of Finland (the original was never made for the King of Finland) is kept in the town&#x27;s gemstone gallery. It also houses replicas of the Imperial State Crown of Great Britain, the scepter of the Czar of Russia, the Orbs of Denmark, and the diamond necklace of Marie Antoinette, among other items.

Additional attractions include:
*Kemi church
*Kemi Gemstone Gallery
*Icebreaker Sampo
*The sailship Jähti

==Culture==
Kemi is the hometown of the power metal band Sonata Arctica.

== Politics ==
Results of the 2019 Finnish parliamentary election in Kemi:

*Left Alliance 26.2%
*Social Democratic Party 23.6%
*The Finns Party 19.8%
*Center Party 13.6%

<doc id="378838" wikidata="Q60642" url="?curid=378838" title="M1918 Browning automatic rifle">
<text>The Browning automatic rifle (BAR) is a family of American automatic rifles and machine guns used by the United States and numerous other countries during the 20th century. The primary variant of the BAR series was the M1918, chambered for the .30-06 Springfield rifle cartridge and designed by John Browning in 1917 for the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe as a replacement for the French-made Chauchat and M1909 Benét–Mercié machine guns that US forces had previously been issued.

The BAR was designed to be carried by infantrymen during an assault advance while supported by the sling over the shoulder, or to be fired from the hip. This is a concept called &quot;walking fire&quot;—thought to be necessary for the individual soldier during trench warfare. The BAR never entirely lived up to the original hopes of the War Department as either a rifle or a machine gun.

The US Army, in practice, used the BAR as a light machine gun, often fired from a bipod (introduced on models after 1938). A variant of the original M1918 BAR, the Colt Monitor machine rifle, remains the lightest production automatic firearm chambered for the .30-06 Springfield cartridge, though the limited capacity of its standard 20-round magazine tended to hamper its utility in that role.

Although the weapon did see action in late 1918 during World War I, the BAR did not become standard issue in the US Army until 1938, when it was issued to squads as a portable light machine gun. The BAR saw extensive service in both World War II and the Korean War and saw limited service in the Vietnam War. The US Army began phasing out the BAR in the 1950s, when it was intended to be replaced by a squad automatic weapon (SAW) variant of the M14, and as a result the US Army was without a portable light machine gun until the introduction of the M60 machine gun in 1957.

==History==
The US entered World War I with an inadequate, small, and obsolete assortment of domestic and foreign machine gun designs, due primarily to bureaucratic indecision and the lack of an established military doctrine for their employment. When the United States declaration of war on Germany was announced on 6 April 1917, the high command was made aware that to fight this trench war, dominated by machine-guns, they had on hand a mere 670 M1909 Benét–Merciés, 282 M1904 Maxims and 158 Colt-Browning M1895s. After much debate, it was finally agreed that a rapid rearmament with domestic weapons would be required, but until that time, US troops would be issued whatever the French and British had to offer. The arms donated by the French were often second-rate or surplus and chambered in 8mm Lebel, further complicating logistics as machine gunners and infantrymen were issued different types of ammunition.

===Development===
Browning began to design the weapon later known as the BAR in 1910. He demonstrated the prototypes to the US military, which did not see an immediate use for the weapon until 1917.

In 1917, prior to America&#x27;s entry to the war, John Browning personally brought to Washington, D.C. two types of automatic weapons for the purposes of demonstration: a water-cooled machine gun (later adopted as the M1917 Browning machine gun) and a shoulder-fired automatic rifle known then as the &quot;Browning Machine Rifle&quot; or &quot;BMR&quot;, both chambered for the standard US .30-06 Springfield (7.62×63mm) cartridge. Colt and the Ordnance Department arranged for a public demonstration of both weapons at a location in southern Washington, D.C. known as Congress Heights. There, on 27 February 1917, in front of a crowd of 300 people (including high-ranking military officials, congressmen, senators, foreign dignitaries and the press), the Army staged a live-fire demonstration which so impressed the gathered crowd, that Browning was immediately awarded a contract for the weapon and it was hastily adopted into service (the water-cooled machine gun underwent further testing).
Additional tests were conducted for US Army Ordnance officials at Springfield Armory in May 1917, and both weapons were unanimously recommended for immediate adoption. In order to avoid confusion with the belt-fed M1917 machine gun, the BAR came to be known as the &quot;M1918&quot; or &quot;Rifle, Caliber .30, Automatic, Browning, M1918&quot; according to official nomenclature. On 16 July 1917, 12,000 BARs were ordered from Colt&#x27;s Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company, which had secured an exclusive concession to manufacture the BAR under Browning&#x27;s patents (Browning&#x27;s was owned by Colt). However Colt was already producing at peak capacity (contracted to manufacture the Vickers machine gun for the British Army) and requested a delay in production while they expanded their manufacturing output with a new facility in Meriden, Connecticut. Due to the urgent need for the weapon, the request was denied and the Winchester Repeating Arms Company (WRAC) was designated as the prime contractor. Winchester gave valuable assistance in refining the BAR&#x27;s final design, correcting the drawings in preparation for mass production. Among the changes made, the ejection pattern was modified (spent casings were directed to the right side of the weapon instead of straight up).

===Initial M1918 production===
Since work on the weapon did not begin until February 1918, so hurried was the schedule at Winchester to bring the BAR into full production that the first production batch of 1,800 rifles was delivered out of spec; it was discovered that many components did not interchange between rifles, and production was temporarily halted until manufacturing procedures were upgraded to bring the weapon up to specifications. The initial contract with Winchester called for 25,000 BARs. They were in full production by June 1918, delivering 4,000 units, and from July were turning out 9,000 units per month.

Colt and Marlin-Rockwell Corp. also began production shortly after Winchester got into full production. Marlin-Rockwell, burdened by a contract to make rifles for the Belgian government, acquired the Mayo Radiator Co.&#x27;s factory and used it exclusively to carry out production of the BAR. The first unit from this source was delivered on 11 June 1918 and the company&#x27;s peak output reached 200 automatic rifles per day. Colt had produced only 9,000 BARs by the time of the armistice due to the heavy demands of previous orders. These three companies produced a combined daily output of 706 rifles and a total of approximately 52,000 BARs were delivered by all sources by the end of the war. Between 1918 and 1919, 102,174 BARs had been manufactured jointly by Colt, Winchester, and Marlin-Rockwell.

By July 1918, the BAR had begun to arrive in France, and the first unit to receive them was the US Army&#x27;s 79th Infantry Division, which took them into action for the first time on 13 September 1918. The weapon was personally demonstrated against the enemy by 2nd Lt. Val Allen Browning, the inventor&#x27;s son. Despite being introduced very late in the war, the BAR made an impact disproportionate to its numbers; it was used extensively during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and made a significant impression on the Allies (France alone requested 15,000 automatic rifles to replace their Chauchat machine rifles).

US Marines briefly took possession of the BAR. Troops from the First Battalion of the Sixth Marines had talked the &quot;doggies&quot; of the US Army&#x27;s 36th Division into trading their BARs for their Chauchats. However, complaints from officers of the 36th resulted in the issuance of a command from Marine Lt. Col. Harry Lee on 9 October 1918: All Browning guns and equipment in Marine possession were to be turned in.

==Design details and accessories==
The M1918 is a selective-fire, air-cooled automatic rifle using a gas-operated, long-stroke piston rod actuated by propellant gases bled through a vent in the barrel. The bolt is locked by a rising bolt lock. The weapon fires from an open bolt. The spring-powered cartridge casing extractor is contained in the bolt and a fixed ejector is installed in the trigger group. The BAR is striker-fired (the bolt carrier serves as the striker) and uses a trigger mechanism with a fire selector lever that enables operating in either semi-automatic or fully automatic firing modes. The selector lever is located on the left side of the receiver and is simultaneously the manual safety (selector lever in the &quot;&quot;S&quot; position – weapon is &quot;s&quot;afe, &quot;F&quot; – &quot;f&quot;ire, &quot;A&quot;&quot; – &quot;a&quot;utomatic fire). The &quot;safe&quot; setting blocks the trigger.

The weapon&#x27;s barrel is screwed into the receiver and is not quickly detachable. The M1918 feeds using double-column 20-round box magazines, although 40-round magazines were also used in an anti-aircraft role; these were withdrawn from use in 1927. The M1918 has a cylindrical flash suppressor fitted to the muzzle end. The original BAR was equipped with a fixed wooden buttstock and closed-type adjustable iron sights taken from the Enfield 1917, consisting of a forward post and a rear leaf sight with 100 to 1,500 yard (91-1,372 m) range graduations.
As a heavy automatic rifle designed for support fire, the M1918 was not fitted with a bayonet mount and no bayonet was ever issued, though one experimental bayonet fitting was made by Winchester.

== Variants and subsequent models==

During its lengthy service life, the BAR underwent continuous development, receiving many improvements and modifications. The first major attempt at improving the M1918 resulted in the M1922 machine rifle, adopted by the United States Cavalry in 1922 as a troop-level light machine gun. The weapon used a new heavy profile ribbed barrel, an adjustable spiked bipod (mounted to a swiveling collar on the barrel) with a rear, stock-mounted monopod, a side-mounted sling swivel and a new rear buttplate, fixed to the stock retaining sleeve. The hand guard was changed, and in 1926 the BAR&#x27;s sights were redesigned to accommodate the heavy-bullet 172-grain M1 .30-06 ball ammunition then coming into service for machinegun use.

In 1931, the Colt Arms Co. introduced the Monitor Automatic Machine Rifle (R 80), intended primarily for use by prison guards and law-enforcement agencies. Intended for use as a shoulder-fired automatic rifle, the Monitor omitted the bipod, instead featuring a separate pistol grip and butt stock attached to a lightweight receiver, along with a shortened, , barrel fitted with a Cutts compensator. Weighing empty, the Monitor had a rate of fire of approximately 500 rpm. Around 125 were produced; 90 were purchased by the FBI. Eleven went to the US Treasury Department in 1934, while the rest went to various state prisons, banks, security companies and accredited police departments. Although available for export sale, no examples appear to have been exported.

In 1932, a greatly shortened version was developed, the &quot;BAR, cal. .30, M1918 (modified)&quot; better known as the &quot;jungle BAR&quot; designed for bush and jungle warfare was developed by USMC Maj. H.L. Smith and was the subject of an evaluative report by Capt. Merritt A. Edson, ordnance officer at the Quartermaster&#x27;s Depot in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The barrel was shortened nine inches (229 mm) at the muzzle and the gas port and gas cylinder tube were relocated. The modified BAR weighed and was only long overall. Though it proved superior to the M1918 in accuracy when fired prone in automatic mode and equal in accuracy to the standard M1918 at ranges of 500–600 yards (460–550 m) from a rest, it was less accurate when fired from the shoulder, and had a loud report combined with a fierce muzzle blast. Attaching a Cutts compensator materially reduced the muzzle blast, but this was more than offset by the increase in smoke and dust at the muzzle when fired, obscuring the operator&#x27;s vision. Nor did it improve control of the weapon when fired in bursts of automatic fire. Though the report recommended building six of these short-barreled jungle BARs for further evaluation, no further work was done on the project.

The M1918A1, featuring a lightweight spiked bipod with a leg height adjustment feature attached to the gas cylinder and a hinged steel butt plate, was formally approved on 24 June 1937. The M1918A1 was intended to increase the weapon&#x27;s effectiveness and controllability firing in bursts. Relatively few M1918s were rebuilt to the new M1918A1 standard.

In April 1938, work commenced on an improved BAR for the US Army. The army specified a need for a BAR designed to serve in the role of a light machine gun for squad-level support fire. Early prototypes were fitted with barrel-mounted bipods as well as pistol grip housings and a unique rate-of-fire reducer mechanism purchased from FN Herstal. The rate reducer mechanism performed well in trials, and the pistol grip housing enabled the operator to fire more comfortably from the prone position. However, in 1939 the army declared that all modifications to the basic BAR be capable of being retrofitted to earlier M1918 guns with no loss of parts interchangeability. This effectively killed the FN-designed pistol grip and its proven rate reducer mechanism for the new M1918 replacement.

The final development of the M1918A2 was authorized on 30 June 1938. The FN-designed pistol grip and rate-reducer mechanism with two rates of automatic fire was shelved in favor of a rate-reducer mechanism designed by Springfield Armory, and housed in the butt stock. The Springfield Armory rate reducer also provided two selectable rates of fully automatic fire only, activated by engaging the selector toggle. Additionally, a skid-footed bipod was fitted to the muzzle end of the barrel, magazine guides were added to the front of the trigger guard, the hand guard was shortened, a heat shield was added to help the cooling process, a small separate stock rest (monopod) was included for attachment to the butt and the weapon&#x27;s role was changed to that of a squad light machine gun. The BAR&#x27;s rear sight scales were also modified to accommodate the newly standardized M2 ball ammunition with its lighter, flat-base bullet. The M1918A2&#x27;s walnut butt stock is approximately one inch (2.5 cm) longer than the M1918 BAR&#x27;s butt stock. The M1918A2&#x27;s barrel was also fitted with a new flash suppressor and fully adjustable iron sights. Towards the end of the war a barrel-mounted carrying handle was added.

Because of budget limitations initial M1918A2 production consisted of conversions of older M1918 BARs (remaining in surplus) along with a limited number of M1922s and M1918A1s. After the outbreak of war, attempts to ramp up new M1918A2 production were stymied by the discovery that the World War I tooling used to produce the M1918 was either worn out or incompatible with modern production machinery. New production was first undertaken at the New England Small Arms Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. (a total of 188,380 new weapons were manufactured). In 1942 a shortage of black walnut for butt stocks and grips led to the development of a black plastic butt stock for the BAR. Composed of a mixture of Bakelite and Resinox, and impregnated with shredded fabric, the stocks were sandblasted to reduce glare. The Firestone Rubber and Latex Products Co. produced the plastic butt stock for the US Army, which was formally adopted on March 21, 1942. The M1922 machine rifle was declared obsolete in 1940, but they were used by Merrill&#x27;s Marauders in Burma later in the war as a slightly lighter alternative to the M1918A2.

Production rates greatly increased in 1943, after IBM introduced a method of casting BAR receivers from a new type of malleable iron developed by the Saginaw division of General Motors, called &quot;ArmaSteel&quot;. After it successfully passed a series of tests at Springfield Armory, the Chief of Ordnance instructed other BAR receiver manufacturers to change over from steel to ArmaSteel castings for this part. During the Korean War M1918A2 production was resumed, this time contracted to the Royal McBee Typewriter Co., which produced an additional 61,000 M1918A2s.

A bullpup prototype existed as the Cook automatic rifle during the 1950s. It was developed at Benicia Armoury by US Army ordnance officer Lauren C. Cook. It used the gas operation of the M1918 BAR with the trigger group in front of the magazine. The operation fired from a closed bolt. The Cook automatic rifle was 30 inches retaining the barrel length of 18 inches.

The last US-made variant was produced in 7.62×51mm NATO, as T34 Automatic rifle.

===International and commercial models===
====Export models====
The BAR also found a ready market overseas and in various forms was widely exported. In 1919 the Colt company developed and produced a commercial variant called the &quot;Automatic Machine Rifle Model 1919&quot; (company designation: &quot;Model U&quot;), which has a different return mechanism compared to the M1918 (it is installed in the stock rather than the gas tube) and lacks a flash hider. Later the Model 1924 rifle was offered for a short period of time, featuring a pistol grip and a redesigned hand guard. These Colt automatic rifles were available in a number of calibers, including .30-06 Springfield (7.62×63mm), 7.65×53mm Belgian Mauser, 7×57mm Mauser, 6.5×55mm, 7.92×57mm Mauser and .303 British (7.7×56mmR). All of the 6.5×55mm-caliber Colt automatic rifles appear to have been sold directly to FN.

An improved version of the Model 1924, the Model 1925 (R75), achieved the highest popularity in export sales. It is based on the Model 1924 but uses a heavy, finned barrel, a lightweight bipod and is equipped with dust covers in the magazine well and ejection port (some of these features were patented: US patents #1548709 and #1533968). The Model 1925 was produced in various calibers, including .30-06 Springfield (7.62×63mm), 7.65×53mm Belgian Mauser, 7×57mm Mauser, 7.92×57mm Mauser, and .303 British (7.7×56mmR) (no Colt-manufactured Model 1925 rifles in 6.5×55mm appear to have been sold). A minor variant of the Model 1925 (R75) was the R75A light machine gun with a quick-change barrel (produced in 1942 in small quantities for the Dutch army). Between 1921 and 1928 FN Herstal imported over 800 Colt-manufactured examples of the Colt Machine Rifles for sale abroad.

All of the Colt automatic machine rifles, including the Colt Monitor, were available for export sale. After 1929 the Model 1925 and the Colt Monitor were available for export sale in Colt&#x27;s exclusive sales territories per its agreement with FN. These Colt territories included North America, Central America, the West Indies, South America, Great Britain, Russia, Turkey, Siam (Thailand), India and Australia.

====Belgium====
A variant known as the &quot;FN Mle 1930&quot; was developed in 7.65×53mm Belgian Mauser by FN Herstal and adopted by the Belgian army. The Mle 1930 is basically a licensed copy of the Colt Automatic Machine Rifle, Model 1925 (R 75). The Mle 1930 has a different gas valve and a mechanical rate-reducing fire control mechanism designed by Dieudonné Saive, located in the trigger guard-pistol grip housing. Some of these FN rate reducer mechanisms and pistol grip housings were later purchased by Springfield Armory for evaluation and possible adoption on a replacement for the M1918. The weapon also had a hinged shoulder plate and was adapted for use on a tripod mount. In 1932 Belgium adopted a new version of the FN Mle 1930 allocated the service designation &quot;FN Mle D&quot; (D—&quot;demontable&quot; or &quot;removable&quot;), which had a quick-change barrel, shoulder rest and a simplified take-down method for easier cleaning and maintenance. The Mle D was produced even after World War II in versions adapted for .30-06 Springfield (for Belgian service) and 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition (for Egyptian service). The final variant in Belgian service was the Model DA1 chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge and feeding from the 20-round magazines for the FN FAL battle rifle.

==== France ====

In 1922, the French Army considered the introduction of the BAR or of the &quot;Fusil-mitrailleur MAS modèle 1922&quot;, a copy of the BAR produced by the Manufacture d&#x27;armes de Saint-Étienne. The FM 24/29 light machine gun was eventually adopted.

====Poland====

Production of the BAR in Belgium began only after signing an agreement with Poland (on 10 December 1927) involving the procurement of 10,000 wz. 1928 light machine guns chambered in 7.92×57mm Mauser, which are similar to the R75 variant but designed specifically to meet the requirements of the Polish army. Changes to the base design include a pistol grip, different type of bipod, open-type V-notch rear sight and a slightly longer barrel. Subsequent rifles were assembled in Poland under license by the state rifle factory (Państwowa Fabryka Karabinów) in Warsaw. The wz. 1928 was accepted into service with the Polish army in 1927 under the formal name &quot;7,92 mm rkm Browning wz. 1928&quot; and—until the outbreak of World War II—was the primary light support weapon of Polish infantry and cavalry formations (in 1939 Poland had a total of approximately 20,000 wz. 1928 rifles in service). Additional detail modifications were introduced on the production line; among them were the replacement of the iron sights with a smaller version and reshaping the butt to a fish tail.
In the mid-1930s, Polish small-arms designer Wawrzyniec Lewandowski was tasked with developing a flexible aircraft-mounted machine gun based on the Browning wz.1928. This resulted in the wz. 1937. Changes included increasing the weapon&#x27;s rate of fire to 1,100 rounds/min, eliminating the butt stock, adding a spade-type grip to the rear of the receiver, moving the main drive spring under the barrel and, most importantly, changing the feed system. Sustained fire was practically impossible with the standard 20-round box magazine, so a new feed mechanism was developed that was added to the receiver as a module. It contains a spring-loaded, bolt-actuated lever that would feed a round from a 91-round pan magazine located above the receiver and force the round into the feed path during unlocking. The machine gun was accepted in 1937 and ordered by the Polish Air Force as the &quot;karabin maszynowy obserwatora wz. 1937&quot; (&quot;observers machine gun model 1937&quot;). Eventually 339 machine guns were acquired and used as armament in the PZL.37 Łoś medium bomber and the LWS-3 Mewa reconnaissance aircraft.

====Sweden====

In 1920, Belgian arms manufacturer Fabrique Nationale (FN) acquired sales and production rights to the BAR series of firearms in Europe from Colt. The first BAR model sold by FN was the Kg m/21 (Kg—&quot;Kulsprutegevär&quot; or &quot;machinegun rifle&quot;) chambered for the 6.5×55mm m/94 cartridge. The m/21 is a variant of the Model 1919 designed to Swedish specifications and manufactured initially by Colt&#x27;s and later under license at the Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori in Eskilstuna. Compared to the Model 1919, the Swedish weapon has—apart from the different caliber—a spiked bipod and dust covers for ejection. The m/21 would become one of Sweden&#x27;s main support weapons in the interwar years together with the water-cooled, belt-fed Ksp m/1914 medium machine gun (Swedish adaptation of the Austrian M07/12). Dissatisfied with the rapidly overheating fixed barrel of the m/21, Carl Gustaf began to design a new quick-detach mechanism for the barrel that mates the externally grooved chamber to a series of rotating flanges in the receiver operated by a locking lever. The barrel also received cooling fins along its entire length. These enhancements were incorporated into the fm/1935 prototype, which was favorably evaluated during trials in 1935. The final version was the Kg m/37, adopted for service in 1937, which uses a smooth-contour, unfinned barrel. Numerous m/21 guns were retrofitted with the screw-on receiver extension and quick-change barrel and renamed the Kg m/21-37. The m/37 remained in service until replaced by the FN MAG, but was still in second-line use until 1980. Carl Gustaf also developed a belt-fed prototype; however, it was never adopted.

====China====
The Chinese Nationalist Army used the FN Mle 1930 throughout the Second Sino-Japanese War. 29,550 were bought from Belgium between 1933 and 1939. The Chinese BAR was chambered for the German 7.92×57mm Mauser round, the standard rifle cartridge of the National Revolutionary Army. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Chinese Expeditionary Army in Burma was equipped with American BARs. Towards the end of World War II, small quantities of American equipment, including the BAR, made their way into mainland China.

==Civilian use==
===Colt Monitor===
With the cessation of WWI hostilities, Colt Arms Co. received the Browning patents to produce the BAR that had been withheld from issue during the war. This allowed Colt to make the BAR available for commercial sale, including to civilian owners. The Colt Automatic Machine Rifle Model 1919, initially made up of overruns from the M1918 military production contract, was the first of several commercial Colt BARs that would follow. However, the high price of the weapon and its limited utility for most civilian owners resulted in few sales. Ad Topperwien, a famous trick shooter of the early 1920s, purchased one of the first Colt-produced BARs to perform aerial target shooting exhibitions. Occasional BAR sales were made to civilian owners through distributors such as the Ott-Heiskell Hardware Co.

In 1931, the new Colt Monitor was made available to civilians during the Depression at $300 each, including a spare parts kit, sling, cleaning accessories and six magazines, but Colt records indicate no domestic sales to individuals.

===Post National Firearms Act===
After passage of the National Firearms Act of 1934, civilian BAR ownership was restricted even further. Importation of machine guns for transfer between civilians was prohibited in 1968 and the production of machine guns for civilian transfer was banned in 1986. However, machine guns produced prior to 1986 are still transferable, and fully-automatic BAR models exist and occasionally come up for sale to qualified buyers.

===21st century===

Some companies continue to manufacture semi-automatic copies for sale to civilians, such as Ohio Ordnance Works, Inc., in Chardon, Ohio. Ohio Ordnance Works produces a contemporary semi-automatic variant of the M1918 called &quot;1918A3-SLR&quot;, and a much modified lightened version called HCAR (Heavy Counter Assault Rifle), which are legal for civilians without an FFL (federal firearms license) to own.

==Criminal and law enforcement use==
Although the Colt Monitor version of the BAR failed to interest US civilian buyers in the midst of the Depression, the underworld was a lot more interested: in 1936 the price of a black-market Colt Monitor was $5,000, with military BARs going for somewhat less. The army&#x27;s M1918 was a favorite of gangster Clyde Barrow, who obtained his through periodic robberies of Army National Guard armories in the Midwest. Barrow liked to use armor-piercing (AP) .30-06 ammunition he obtained from armory stores, and frequently modified his BARs to suit his own needs. Barrow taught his girlfriend Bonnie Parker to fire the M1918 as well, and by all accounts she was an excellent BAR operator. She used an M1918 on full-automatic to pin down unsuspecting law officers after they confronted the gang at a house in Joplin, Missouri. A Missouri highway patrolman at the scene, forced to dive for cover behind a substantial oak tree after Bonnie Parker opened up on him, later stated, &quot;That little red-headed woman filled my face with splinters on the other side of that tree with one of those damned guns.&quot;

As the use of automatic weapons by criminal elements in the US became more widespread, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover ordered the agency to acquire and commence regular training with automatic shoulder weapons, including the Thompson submachine gun and the BAR. For its BARs the FBI turned to Colt, which sold 90 Colt Monitor automatic machine rifles to the agency. Some of the FBI&#x27;s Monitors were distributed to field offices for use as support weapons if needed on a particular operation, while the remainder were retained at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, for training purposes. Colt sold an additional 11 Colt Monitors to the US Treasury Department in 1934, while 24 guns were sold to state prisons, banks, security companies and accredited city, county and state police departments. At least one member of the ambush team that killed Bonnie and Clyde was armed with a Colt Monitor.

Although it has sometimes been alleged that the M1918 or M1918A2 BAR was used by members of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in a shootout with Los Angeles police on May 17, 1974, no SLA members ever used such a weapon. The confusion arose out of Browning&#x27;s decision in the 1970s to also designate its semi-automatic hunting rifle the Browning BAR. The SLA converted a .30-06 Browning BAR hunting rifle and a .243 Remington Model 742 to automatic fire by filing down the sear, and it was these weapons that were used in the shootout. 

==In US military service==
=== World War I ===

At its inception, the M1918 was intended to be used as a shoulder-fired rifle capable of both semi-automatic and fully automatic fire. First issued in September 1918 to the American Expeditionary Forces, it was based on the concept of &quot;walking fire&quot;, a French practice in use since 1916 for which the CSRG 1915 (Chauchat) had been used accompanying advancing squads of riflemen toward the enemy trenches, as regular machine guns were too cumbersome to move with the troops during an assault.

In addition to shoulder-fired operation, BAR gunners were issued a belt with magazine pouches for the BAR and sidearm along with a &quot;cup&quot; to support the stock of the rifle when held at the hip. In theory, this allowed the soldier to lay suppressive fire while walking forward, keeping the enemy&#x27;s head down, a practice known as &quot;marching fire&quot;. The idea would resurface in the submachine gun and ultimately the assault rifle. It is not known if any of the belt-cup devices actually saw combat use.

The BAR only saw minor action in France during World War I, being brought into action only as late as September 1918, less than three months before Armistice Day. The intentional delay had been inspired by General Pershing, the AEF commander, in order not to let the BAR fall into enemy hands too early. Fifty-two thousand BARs were available by the end of the war in November.

===Interwar use===

During the interwar years, as the U.S. Army was reduced significantly in size, the BAR remained in the smaller extant Regular Army and by the 1930s, was also issued to state national guard units to be maintained at their armories. Given the part-time nature, smaller manning and lesser security of these national guard armories when compared to regular army installations, some BARs were subject to plunder by domestic civilian criminal elements.

The BAR was also standard issue to US naval landing forces during the period. The weapon was a standard item in US warship armories, and each BAR was accompanied by a spare barrel. Large capital ships often had over 200 BARs on board, with many of the US Navy BARs remaining in service well into the 1960s.

The BAR also saw action with US Marine Corps units participating in the Haitian and Nicaraguan interventions, as well as with US Navy shipboard personnel in the course of patrol and gunboat duty along the Yangtze River in China. The First Marine Brigade stationed in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, noted that training a man to use the BAR proficiently took a full two days of range practice and instruction, compared to half a day with the .45 caliber Thompson submachine gun.

Prior to World War II, both the US Army and Marine Corps had a separate BAR squad together with three rifle squads in the &quot;square&quot; organisation of the time. When converting to the &quot;triangular&quot; organisation the separate BAR squad was eliminated with BARs going to each rifle squad.

===World War II===
When the threat of a new war arose, Ordnance belatedly realized that it had no portable, squad light machine gun, and attempted to convert the M1918 BAR to that role with the adoption of the M1918A2 by the US Army on 30 June 1938. The BAR was issued as the sole automatic fire support for a twelve-man squad, and all men were trained at the basic level how to operate and fire the weapon in case the designated operators were killed or wounded. At the start of the war, infantry companies designated three-man BAR teams, a gunner, an assistant gunner, and an ammunition bearer who carried additional magazines for the gun. By 1944, some units were using one-man BAR &quot;teams&quot; with the other riflemen in the squad detailed to carry additional magazines or bandoliers of .30 ammunition. Contrary to certain claims, the BAR was issued to soldiers of various heights.

As originally conceived, US Army tactical doctrine called for one M1918A2 per squad, using several men to support and carry ammunition for the gun. Fire and movement tactics centered on the M1 riflemen in the squad while the BAR man was detailed to support the riflemen in the attack and provide mobility to the riflemen with a base of fire. This doctrine received a setback early in the war after US ground forces encountered German troops, well-armed with automatic weapons including fast-firing, portable machine guns. In some cases, particularly in the attack, every fourth German infantryman was equipped with an automatic weapon, either a submachine gun or a full-power machine gun.

In an attempt to overcome the BAR&#x27;s limited continuous-fire capability, US Army divisions increasingly began to specify two BAR fire teams per squad, following the practice of the US Marine Corps. One team would typically provide covering fire until a magazine was empty, whereupon the second team would open fire, thus allowing the first team to reload. In the Pacific, the BAR was often employed at the point or tail of a patrol or infantry column, where its firepower could help break contact on a jungle trail in the event of an ambush. After combat experience showed the benefits of maximizing portable automatic firepower in squad-size formations, the US Marine Corps began to increase the number of BARs in its combat divisions, from 513 per division in 1943 to 867 per division in 1945. A thirteen-man squad was developed, consisting of 3 four-man fire teams, with one BAR per fire team, or three BARs per squad. Instead of supporting the M1 riflemen in the attack, Marine tactical doctrine was focused around the BAR, with riflemen supporting and protecting the BAR gunner.

Despite the improvements in the M1918A2, the BAR remained a difficult weapon to master with its open bolt and strong recoil spring, requiring additional range practice and training to hit targets accurately without flinching. As a squad light machine gun, the BAR&#x27;s effectiveness was mixed, since its thin, non-quick-change barrel and small magazine capacity greatly limited its firepower in comparison to genuine light machine guns such as the British Bren and the Japanese Type 96. The weapon&#x27;s rate-reducer mechanism, a delicately balanced spring-and-weight system described by one ordnance sergeant as a &quot;Rube Goldberg device&quot;, came in for much criticism, often causing malfunctions when not regularly cleaned. The bipod and buttstock rest (monopod), which contributed so much to the M1918A2&#x27;s accuracy when firing prone on the rifle range, proved far less valuable under actual field combat conditions. The stock rest was dropped from production in 1942, while the M1918A2&#x27;s bipod and flash hider were often discarded by individual soldiers and marines to save weight and improve portability, particularly in the Pacific Theater of war. With these modifications, the BAR effectively reverted to its original role as a portable, shoulder-fired automatic rifle.

Due to production demands, war priorities, subcontractor issues, and material shortages, demand for the M1918A2 frequently exceeded supply, and as late as 1945 some Army units were sent into combat still carrying older, unmodified M1918 weapons.

After a period of service, ordnance personnel began to receive BARs with inoperable or malfunctioning recoil buffer mechanisms. This was eventually traced to the soldier&#x27;s common practice of cleaning the BAR in a vertical position with the butt of the weapon on the ground, allowing cleaning fluid and burned powder to collect in the recoil buffer mechanism. Additionally, unlike the M1 rifle, the BAR&#x27;s gas cylinder was never changed to stainless steel. Consequently, the gas cylinder frequently rusted solid from the use of corrosive-primered M2 service ammunition in a humid environment when not stripped and cleaned on a daily basis. While not without design flaws (a thin-diameter, fixed barrel that quickly overheated, limited magazine capacity, complex field-strip/cleaning procedure, unreliable recoil buffer mechanism, a gas cylinder assembly made of corrosion-prone metals, and many small internal parts), the BAR proved rugged and reliable enough when regularly field-stripped and cleaned.

During World War II, the BAR saw extensive service, both official and unofficial, with many branches of service. One of the BAR&#x27;s most unusual uses was as a defensive aircraft weapon. In 1944, Captain Wally A. Gayda, of the USAAF Air Transport Command, reportedly used a BAR to return fire against a Japanese Army Nakajima fighter that had attacked his C-46 cargo plane over the Hump in Burma. Gayda shoved the rifle out his forward cabin window, emptying the magazine and apparently killing the Japanese pilot.

===Korean War===
The BAR continued in service in the Korean War. The last military contract for the manufacture of the M1918A2 was awarded to the Royal Typewriter Co. of Hartford, Connecticut, which manufactured a total of 61,000 M1918A2s during the conflict, using ArmaSteel cast receivers and trigger housings. In his study of infantry weapons in Korea, historian S.L.A. Marshall interviewed hundreds of officers and men in after-action reports on the effectiveness of various U.S. small arms in the conflict. General Marshall&#x27;s report noted that an overwhelming majority of respondents praised the BAR and the utility of automatic fire delivered by a lightweight, portable small arm in both day and night engagements. In his autobiography Colonel David Hackworth praised the BAR as &#x27;the best weapon of the Korean War&#x27;.

A typical BAR gunner of the Korean War carried the twelve-magazine belt and combat suspenders, with three or four extra magazines in pockets. Extra canteens, .45 pistol, grenades, and a flak vest added still more weight. As in World War II, many BAR gunners disposed of the heavy bipod and other accoutrements of the M1918A2, but unlike the prior conflict the flash hider was always retained because of its utility in night fighting.

The large amounts of ammunition expended by BAR teams in Korea placed additional demands on the assistant gunner to stay in close contact with the BAR at all times, particularly on patrols. While the BAR magazines themselves always seemed to be in short supply, Gen. Marshall reported that &quot;riflemen in the squad were markedly willing to carry extra ammunition for the BAR man&quot;.

In combat, the M1918A2 frequently decided the outcome of determined attacks by North Korean and Chinese communist forces. Communist tactical doctrine centered on the mortar and machine gun, with attacks designed to envelop and cut off United Nations forces from supply and reinforcement. Communist machine gun teams were the best-trained men in any given North Korean or Chinese infantry unit, skilled at placing their heavily camouflaged and protected weapons as close to UN forces as possible. Once concealed, they often surprised UN forces by opening fire at very short ranges, covering any exposed ground with a hail of accurately sighted machine gun fire. Under these conditions it was frequently impossible for US machine gun crews to move up their Browning M1919A4 and M1919A6 guns in response without taking heavy casualties; when they were able to do so, their position was carefully noted by the enemy, who would frequently kill the exposed gun crews with mortar or machine gun fire while they were still emplacing their guns. The BAR gunner, who could stealthily approach the enemy gun position alone (and prone if need be), proved invaluable in this type of combat.

During the height of combat, the BAR gunner was often used as the &#x27;fire brigade&#x27; weapon, helping to bolster weak areas of the perimeter under heavy pressure by communist forces. In defense, it was often used to strengthen the firepower of a forward outpost. Another role for the BAR was to deter or eliminate enemy sniper fire. In the absence of a trained sniper, the BAR proved more effective than the random response of five or six M1 riflemen.

Compared to World War II, US infantry forces saw a huge increase in the number of night engagements. The added firepower of the BAR rifleman and his ability to redeploy to &#x27;hot spots&#x27; around the unit perimeter proved indispensable in deterring night infiltration by skirmishers as well as repelling large-scale night infantry assaults.

While new-production M1918A2 guns were almost universally praised for faultless performance in combat, a number of malfunctions in combat were reported with armory-reconditioned M1918A2s, particularly weapons that had been reconditioned by Ordnance in Japan, which did not replace operating (recoil) springs as a requirement of the reconditioning program. After decades of complaints, ordnance addressed the problem of maintaining the problematic gas piston on the BAR by issuing disposable nylon gas valves. When the nylon valve became caked over with carbon, it could be discarded and replaced with a fresh unit, eliminating the tedious task of cleaning and polishing the valve with wire brush and GI solvent (frequently in short supply to line units).

===Vietnam War===

The M1918A2 was used in the early stages of the Vietnam War, when the US delivered a quantity of &quot;obsolete&quot;, second-line small arms to the South Vietnamese Army and associated allies, including the Montagnard hill tribespeople of South Vietnam. US Special Forces advisors frequently chose the BAR over currently available infantry weapons. As one Special Forces sergeant declared, &quot;Many times since my three tours of duty in Vietnam I have thanked God for ... having a BAR that actually worked, as opposed to the jamming M16 ... We had a lot of Viet Cong infiltrators in all our [Special Forces] camps, who would steal weapons every chance they got. Needless to say, the most popular weapon to steal was the venerable old BAR.&quot;

An experimental variant was tested at Fort Benning. The barrel was cut back to the gas tube, had a M60 style bipod and flash suppressor, and a shortened stock with the flip up shoulder rest from the M60. Final mod was a box mag that held 50 rounds. The stated purpose was for anti vehicle and structure use. Still heavy but with AP rounds would shred brick/block structures and most things on wheels. Allegedly it was requested by USSS and SOF forces.

A retrospective analysis by two American historians stated that Browning Automatic Rifle related shipments had provided &quot;serviceable weapons&quot; yet that the generally &quot;short and slightly built&quot; Vietnamese men using them experienced problems given the nature of &quot;Western standards&quot; around physicality.

===Post-Vietnam use===
Quantities of the BAR remained in use by the Army National Guard up until the mid-1970s. Many recipients of US foreign aid adopted the BAR and used it into the 1980s and 1990s.

<doc id="378848" wikidata="Q2321079" url="?curid=378848" title="Eamon Dunphy">
<text>Eamon Martin Dunphy (born 3 August 1945) is an Irish media personality, journalist, broadcaster, author, sports pundit and former professional footballer. He grew up playing football for several youth teams including Stella Maris. Since retiring from the sport, he has become recognisable to Irish television audiences as a football analyst during coverage of the Premier League, UEFA Champions League and international football on RTÉ.

As well as his slot with RTÉ, Dunphy has worked for its rival television station, TV3 (for which he has presented a chat show and a game show), and rival radio stations Today FM and Newstalk. He was the original presenter of &quot;The Last Word&quot; on Today FM. Between 2004 and 2006, Dunphy presented the breakfast programme on Dublin&#x27;s local Newstalk 106 radio station before it became a national broadcaster. Later he moved to RTÉ Radio 1, where he presented a weekly programme, &quot;Conversations with Eamon Dunphy&quot; until 2009. He then returned to Newstalk, now broadcasting nationwide, only to leave again in 2011. Dunphy continues to write a column on football for the &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot; newspaper and does his podcast The Stand.

==Early life==
Dunphy grew up in Drumcondra, Dublin, in what he described as &quot;a one-room tenement flat [with] no electricity, no hot water&quot;. He attended Saint Patrick&#x27;s National School, Drumcondra. In 1958 he got a one year government scholarship to Sandymount High School but he had to work as a messenger at tweed clothing shop Kevin and Howlin.

==Club career==
A promising footballer, he left Dublin while still a teenager to join Manchester United as an apprentice. Dunphy did not break into the first team at United, and subsequently left to play for York City, Millwall, Charlton Athletic, Reading and Shamrock Rovers. It was at Millwall that Dunphy made the most impact; he was considered an intelligent and skilful player in the side&#x27;s midfield.

Dunphy was a member of &quot;The Class of &#x27;71&quot;, the Millwall side that failed by just one point to gain promotion to the Football League First Division.

He accompanied Johnny Giles back to Ireland to join Shamrock Rovers in 1977. Giles wanted to make the club Ireland&#x27;s first full-time professional club, and hoped to make Rovers into a force in European football by developing talented young players at home who would otherwise go to clubs in England. Dunphy was originally intended to be in charge of youth development. However, despite an FAI Cup winners medal in 1978 (his only medal in senior football) and two appearances in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Dunphy became disillusioned with the Irish game and dropped out of football altogether to concentrate on a career in journalism.

==International career==
Dunphy played 23 times for the Republic of Ireland and was Millwall&#x27;s most capped international footballer with 22 caps, until surpassed by David Forde and Shane Ferguson.

He made his Ireland début on 10 November 1965 in the play-off at the Parc des Princes in Paris for the 1966 FIFA World Cup which Spain won 1–0, thanks to a José Ufarte goal. He went on to become, in his own words, &quot;a good player, not a great player&quot;.

==Journalism==
After retiring from the game, Dunphy first began writing on football for the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; and then contributing regular columns on both football and current events for the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;. He currently writes a column on football for the &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot;. He coined the term &quot;Official Ireland&quot; to refer to the establishment.

He has also worked for &quot;Ireland on Sunday&quot; (now &quot;The Irish Mail on Sunday&quot;), &quot;The Sunday Press&quot; (now defunct), and the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot;.

Since the 1980s, Dunphy has written a number of books. His first and most widely praised book is &quot;Only a Game? The Diary of a Professional Footballer&quot;, which is an autobiographical account of his days playing for Millwall. Written in diary form, it recorded events from the dressing room of his 1973–74 season, which began well for him at Millwall but subsequently ended in disillusionment: after being substituted in a 27 October 1973 home loss to eventual league winners Middlesbrough, Dunphy did not play another game all season, the club finishing mid-table.

In 1985, rock band U2 and manager Paul McGuinness commissioned him to write the story of their origins, formation, early years and the time leading up to their highly successful album &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. His book &quot;Unforgettable Fire - Past, Present, and Future - The Definitive Biography of U2&quot; was published in 1988. It received some favourable reviews, but critics close to the band spoke of many inaccuracies. A verbal war erupted in the press during which Dunphy called lead singer Bono a &quot;pompous git&quot;.

Dunphy has also written a biography of long-serving Manchester United manager Matt Busby and in 2002 ghost wrote the autobiography of Republic of Ireland and Manchester United player Roy Keane.

==Broadcasting career==

===Television===
Since the mid-1980s, Dunphy has regularly appeared as an analyst during football coverage on Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ). Since RTÉ acquired the rights to show English football, he has been a regular contributor to &quot;Premier Soccer Saturday&quot;. He also contributes to analysis of UEFA Champions League games and, in international football, RTÉ&#x27;s coverage of FIFA World Cups, UEFA European Football Championships and qualifying matches involving the Republic of Ireland national football team. He contributed to RTÉ Sport&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Dunphy&#x27;s earnings from RTÉ for his football analysis (plus a radio show) include €328,051 in 2008 and €285,915 in 2007.

In 2001, he became the first male host of the quiz show &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, which aired on TV3, for just one series. In 2003, he was hired again by TV3 to host their new Friday night chat show, entitled &quot;The Dunphy Show&quot;. Pitted head-to-head with RTÉ&#x27;s long-running flagship programme, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, Dunphy&#x27;s show lost what was a highly publicised &quot;ratings war&quot;, and was cancelled before its original run was to conclude.

He is the first presenter of a made-for-mobile television show on the 3 mobile network in Ireland. His rants and &quot;Spoofer of the Week&quot; are watched by thousands of 3 Mobile customers. The shows were awarded &quot;Best Entertainment Show&quot; at Ireland&#x27;s Digital Media Awards. Dunphy admits he never uses a mobile himself but enjoys filming for a mobile audience from his living room in Ranelagh.

In 2009, he made an emotive outburst on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; during a discussion regarding then-Taoiseach Bertie Ahern&#x27;s financial affairs.

In July 2018, Dunphy announced that he was leaving RTÉ after 40 years with the broadcaster, and that he intended to focus on his podcast &quot;The Stand with Eamon Dunphy&quot;.

===Radio===
Dunphy has also had a prominent radio career with several stations, including Today FM, Newstalk and RTÉ Radio 1.

He was the original host in 1997 of the popular current affairs show &quot;The Last Word&quot; on Today FM. In September 2004, he took over &quot;The Breakfast Show&quot; slot on the Dublin radio station Newstalk 106 from David McWilliams. The show tried to court controversy and listeners in equal measure. He failed to attract the large listenership predicted, with only a few additional thousand tuning in. He announced in June 2006 his intention to leave Newstalk 106, citing an inability to sustain the demands of an early morning schedule. After his departure from Newstalk 106, he confirmed he was suffering from a viral illness. He later recovered.

In July 2006, RTÉ announced that Dunphy would present a new weekly programme as part of the new RTÉ Radio 1 autumn schedule.

He rejoined Newstalk but left again in 2011 &quot;due to interference from management and a push to put a more positive spin on the news&quot;. On his last show he accused his boss Denis O&#x27;Brien of &quot;hating journalism&quot;. He quit after Sam Smyth was sacked from Today FM (also owned by O&#x27;Brien), and said management at Newstalk were trying to remove &quot;dissenting voices&quot; like Constantin Gurdgiev from the airwaves.

==Personal life==
Dunphy was a daily Mass-goer until he was preparing for marriage to his first wife, Sandra from Salford, when he was 21. He was Catholic and she was Protestant. The priest instructing them for marriage disapproved strongly of the mixed couple, saying that he should not marry her because she was &quot;not a proper person&quot;. Dunphy&#x27;s observance was already weakening but he quit his daily Mass-going at this point. He and Sandra had two children, a boy and a girl, and Dunphy is now a grandfather. His first marriage ended and he moved to Castletownshend in Cork for two years in the early 1990s. He lived with another partner, Inge, before meeting his second wife, RTÉ commissioning editor Jane Gogan, in the Horseshoe Bar in Dublin in 1992. They married at the Unitarian Church on St Stephen&#x27;s Green on 24 September 2009.

In an interview with &quot;An Phoblacht&quot;, Dunphy, who had previously written highly critical articles on the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin, stated that he is now a Sinn Féin supporter and declared he had voted for them in the 2011 general election. He described their representatives as &quot;incredibly hard-working and incredibly intelligent&quot;.

He published his autobiography entitled &quot;The Rocky Road&quot; in October 2013.

Today, Dunphy generally resides at his home near Ranelagh in Dublin. He also owns a holiday home in Deauville, France.

In May 2017, he said that he is a Liverpool supporter.

==Controversies==
In 1999 a High Court jury awarded £300,000 to politician Proinsias de Rossa over a 1992 article by Dunphy in the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; alleging that De Rossa was aware, while a member of the Workers&#x27; Party, of the Official IRA&#x27;s alleged illegal activities, including bank robberies and forgery 

In 2002 Dunphy was banned from driving for a decade after being arrested for drunk driving and had eight previous convictions under the Road Traffic Act 

In 2020 one of the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;&#x27;s most senior executives admitted that the paper went too far in the vindictive nastiness of its attacks on John Hume mounted by Dunphy in an incendiary back page piece 

==In popular culture==
The deceased satirist and actor Dermot Morgan, known to international audiences as &quot;Father Ted&quot;, did a much-admired Eamon Dunphy impression on the satirical radio show &quot;Scrap Saturday&quot;. Different sketches had him engaged in apparent inane and ridiculous arguments. They ranged from his criticism of Mother Teresa for &quot;not being a real nun&quot; to his attack on the week&#x27;s weather. Dunphy left RTÉ&#x27;s analysis team the day before the 1986 FIFA World Cup Final, when he objected to Morgan&#x27;s portrayal of him and Giles as monosyllabic.

Dunphy&#x27;s hyperbole was parodied on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Après Match&quot; show lampooning celebrities, footballers and broadcasters.

Oliver Callan also does impersonations of Dunphy, one of which Dunphy approved for a radio charity advertisement.

<doc id="378862" wikidata="Q675032" url="?curid=378862" title="Province of Silesia">
<text>The Province of Silesia (; ; ) was a province of Prussia from 1815 to 1919. The Silesia region was part of the Prussian realm since 1742 and established as an official province in 1815, then became part of the German Empire in 1871. In 1919, as part of the Free State of Prussia within Weimar Germany, Silesia was divided into the provinces of Upper Silesia and Lower Silesia. Silesia was reunified briefly from 1 April 1938 to 27 January 1941 as a province of Nazi Germany before being divided back into Upper Silesia and Lower Silesia.

Breslau (present-day Wrocław, Poland) was the provincial capital.

==Geography==

The territory on both sides of the Oder river formed the southeastern part of the Prussian kingdom. It comprised the bulk of the former Bohemian crown land of Upper and Lower Silesia as well as the adjacent County of Kladsko, which the Prussian King Frederick the Great had all conquered from the Austrian Habsburg monarchy under Empress Maria Theresa in the 18th century Silesian Wars. It included the northeastern part of Upper Lusatia around Görlitz and Lauban (Lubań), ceded to Prussia by the Kingdom of Saxony according to the resolutions of the Congress of Vienna in 1815.

The province bordered on the Prussian heartland of Brandenburg (including the newly acquired lands of Lower Lusatia) in the northwest, and on the Grand Duchy of Posen (Province of Posen from 1848) in the north, i.e. the Greater Polish lands that before the 18th century Partitions of Poland had belonged to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In the northeast, Upper Silesia bordered on Congress Poland, i.e. the Kingdom of Poland which had been reconstituted from the Duchy of Warsaw and was made up of former parts of the Prussian and Austrian partitions. Congress Poland was in a personal union with the Russian Empire until 1867 when it was formally integrated as the Vistula Land.

In the east lay the Austrian share, the Lesser Polish Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria with the Free City of Kraków until 1846, and in the south the remaining Bohemian crown lands of Austrian Silesia, Moravia and Bohemia proper. The incorporated Upper Lusatian strip of land in the west touched the remaining territory of the Saxon kingdom and in the furthest west the Prussian Province of Saxony.

== History ==
===Prussian Silesia, 1742–1815===
The coronation of Maria Theresa as queen regnant of the Kingdom of Bohemia immediately triggered an invasion of the region of Silesia by King Frederick the Great of Prussia, thereby starting the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). By the end of the First Silesian War in 1742, the Prussian forces had conquered almost all of the Habsburg crown land in Silesia. The conquest marked the beginning of the era of Prussian Silesia.

According to the peace treaties of Breslau and Berlin, only some smaller parts in the extreme southeast, like the Duchy of Cieszyn as well as the southern parts of the duchies of Troppau and Nysa, remained possessions of the Habsburg monarchy as Austrian Silesia. Attempts by Maria Theresa to regain the crown land in the Second Silesian War (1744–1745) failed and she ultimately had to relinquish her claims over Silesia by the Treaty of Dresden.

The Third Silesian War (1756–1763), a theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War, once again confirmed Prussian control over most of Silesia, and due to its predominantly Protestant population especially in Lower Silesia, it became one of the most loyal territories of the House of Hohenzollern. When the Prussian territories were reorganized upon the Congress of Vienna, the province of Silesia was created out of the territories acquired by Prussia in the Silesian Wars, as well as those Upper Lusatian territories which King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony had to relinquish due to his indecisive attitude in the Napoleonic Wars. As the lands had been part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1806, Silesia was among the western Prussian provinces that lay within the borders of the German Confederation.

=== Province of Silesia ===

====Kingdom of Prussia and German Empire====

In 1815, after the Napoleonic wars, Prussian Silesia was formally reorganized into the province of Silesia. The character of the province&#x27;s eastern third, Upper Silesia, had been much lesser shaped by the medieval German . According to the census of 1905, about three-quarters of the Silesian inhabitants were German–speaking, while a majority of the population to the east of the Oder river spoke Polish, including Silesian and Lach dialects. The indigenous Polish and Sorbian population was subjected to Germanisation policies. Sorbian-language Lutheran preparations for Confirmation were prohibited with the ban lifted only after World War I.

Because of the extended iron ore and black coal deposits of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, there was considerable industrialization and urbanization in Upper Silesia and many people from neighbouring Posen and Congress Poland immigrated at that time. In 1871, Silesia became part of the German Empire as a province of Prussia following the unification of Germany. The Upper Silesian Industrial Region was the second largest industrial agglomeration of the German Empire after the Ruhr area.

Over decades the mainly Catholic Upper Silesian citizens in majority voted for the German Centre Party, while the Lower Silesian constituencies were dominated by the Free-minded Party and the Social Democrats. Ethnic tensions rose on the eve of World War I, with politicians like Wojciech Korfanty separating from the Centre Party and giving utterance to distinct Polish interests.

==== Weimar Republic ====

In 1919, a year after the war ended, the parts of Silesia remaining in Weimar Germany were re-organized into the two provinces of Lower Silesia (&quot;Niederschlesien&quot;) and Upper Silesia (&quot;Oberschlesien&quot;, the former &quot;Regierungsbezirk Oppeln&quot;). After three Silesian Uprisings and the 1921 Upper Silesia plebiscite, the East Upper Silesian part of the province around the industrial city of Katowice was transferred to the Second Polish Republic and incorporated into the Silesian Voivodeship in 1922. In 1920 the Hlučín Region was ceded to Czechoslovakia according to the Treaty of Versailles.

=====Division after WWI=====
====Nazi Germany====
On 1 April 1938 the province of Silesia was re-established by Nazi Germany by uniting the existing Upper Silesia and Lower Silesia provinces. Nazi German persecution of Poles in the province intensified in 1938–1939 with expulsions of Polish activists, distributors of Polish press, priests, craftsmen, farmers, students etc., attacks on Polish cultural centers, banks, enterprises, schools, churches and houses, seizure of Polish libraries, confiscations of Polish press, arrests and deportations of Polish activists to concentration camps and even assassinations.

In 1938, Nazi authorities forced the Lutheran Church not to staff bilingual German-Sorbian parishes with new Sorbian preachers, and the Bund Deutscher Osten demanded a ban on Sorbian church masses, but only a limit of two such masses per month was imposed. There were instances of expulsions of Sorbian pastors.

During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, Gestapo carried out mass arrests of Polish activists, teachers, journalists, entrepreneurs, library directors and chairmen of local branches of the &quot;Sokół&quot; Polish Gymnastic Society, shut down Polish newspapers and seized the funds of Polish banks from the pre-war German Province of Silesia. The arrested Poles were deported to concentration camps. Polish church services were abolished, with the last Polish service held in the Saint Martin church in Wrocław on 17 September 1939. Soon the border was extended eastwards when parts of Polish Silesia were annexed into the province. In the annexed pre-war Polish part the occupiers conducted the genocidal &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; campaign and expulsions of Poles.

The Germans also established the Gross-Rosen concentration camp and multiple prisoner-of-war camps with numerous forced labour subcamps in the region, including Stalag VIII-A, Stalag VIII-B, Stalag VIII-C, Stalag VIII-E, Oflag VIII-A, Oflag VIII-B, Oflag VIII-C, Oflag VIII-F, for Polish POWs and civilians, and French, Belgian, Dutch and later also other Allied POWs.

On 27 January 1941, during World War II, the province of Silesia was divided again by reverting into Upper Silesia and Lower Silesia.

<doc id="378863" wikidata="Q340210" url="?curid=378863" title="Province of Saxony">
<text>The Province of Saxony (), also known as Prussian Saxony (), was a province of the Kingdom of Prussia and later the Free State of Prussia from 1816 until 1944. Its capital was Magdeburg.

It was formed by the merger of various territories ceded or returned to Prussia in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna: most of the former northern territories of the Kingdom of Saxony (the remainder of which became part of Brandenburg or Silesia), the former French Principality of Erfurt, the Duchy of Magdeburg, the Altmark, the Principality of Halberstadt, and some other districts.

The province was bounded by the Electorate of Hesse (the province of Hesse-Nassau after 1866), the Kingdom of Hanover (the province of Hanover after 1866) and the Duchy of Brunswick to the west, Hanover (again) to the north, Brandenburg to the north and east, Silesia to the south-east, and the rump kingdom of Saxony and the small Ernestine duchies to the south. Its shape was very irregular and it entirely surrounded enclaves of Brunswick and some of the Ernestine duchies. It also possessed several exclaves, and was almost entirely bisected by the Duchy of Anhalt save for a small corridor of land around Aschersleben (which itself bisected Anhalt). The river Havel ran along the north-eastern border with Brandenburg north of Plaue but did not follow the border exactly.

The majority of the population was Protestant, with a Catholic minority (about 8% as of 1905) considered part of the diocese of Paderborn. The province sent 20 members to the Reichstag and 38 delegates to the Prussian House of Representatives ().

==History==
===Early history===
The province was created in 1816 out of the following territories:
* the Prussian lands which lay immediately to the (south-)west of the Havel river; those which lay beyond the Elbe – the Altmark, Principality of Halberstadt and County of Wernigerode and the western part of the Duchy of Magdeburg – had been part of the Kingdom of Westphalia from 1807 to 1813 but had since been regained
* territory gained from the Kingdom of Saxony after the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 (confirmed in 1815): the towns and surrounding territories of Wittenberg, Merseburg, Naumburg, Mansfeld, Querfurt, and Henneberg; within the Kingdom of Saxony these had comprised:
** most of the Wittenberg Circle (excluding the far north around Belzig which was merged into Brandenburg)
** the northern parts of the and Circles
** the 
** a small part of the around Ziegenrück, which formed an exclave within Thuringia
** the County of Stolberg-Stolberg
** the Saxon parts of the former County of Mansfeld (the remainder had been part of Magdeburg)
** part of the Principality of Querfurt
** most of the Saxon portion of the former County of Henneberg around Suhl, which formed a second Thuringian exclave
** the former bishoprics of Merseburg and Naumburg
** the ;
* territory given to Prussia after the : lands around Erfurt (formerly directly subordinate to the Emperor of the French as the Principality of Erfurt), the Eichsfeld (formerly belonging to the Archbishopric of Mainz), the former imperial cities of Mühlhausen and Nordhausen, and Quedlinburg Abbey.
* several small territories which were former Hannovarian enclaves within the Altmark, centred around Klötze, and which had been part of the Kingdom of Westphalia from 1807 to 1813
* a small amount of territory on the left bank of the Havel that had previously belonged to Anhalt-Dessau (Anhalt-Zerbst before 1796)

===Later history===
The Province of Saxony was one of the richest regions of Prussia, with highly developed agriculture and industry. In 1932, the province was enlarged with the addition of the regions around Ilfeld and Elbingerode, which had previously been part of the Province of Hanover.

On 1 July 1944, the Province of Saxony was divided along the lines of its three administrative regions. The Erfurt was merged with the Schmalkalden district of the Province of Hesse-Nassau and given to the state of Thuringia. The Magdeburg became the Province of Magdeburg, and the Merseburg became the Province of Halle-Merseburg.

In 1945, the Soviet military administration combined Magdeburg and Halle-Merseburg with the State of Anhalt into the Province of Saxony-Anhalt, with Halle as its capital. The eastern part of the Blankenburg exclave of Brunswick and the Thuringian exclave of Allstedt were also added to Saxony-Anhalt. In 1947, Saxony-Anhalt became a state.

The East German states, including Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt, were abolished in 1952, but they were recreated as part of the reunification of Germany in 1990 (with some slight border changes; in particular territories around Torgau, which were part of Saxony-Anhalt between 1945 and 1952, passed to Saxony) as modern states of Germany.

The borders of the old province of Saxony endured longest in the ecclesiastical sphere, since the Church Province of Saxony in the Evangelical Church remained in existence until 2008.

==Subdivisions==
Prior to 1944, the province of Saxony was divided into three &quot;&quot;. In 1945, only the provinces of Magdeburg and Halle-Merseburg were re-merged.

<text>Zurab Zhvania (; 9 December 1963 – 3 February 2005) was a Georgian politician, who served as Prime Minister of Georgia and Speaker of the Parliament of Georgia. 

Zhvania began his political career at a young age as a member of Green Party in the early 90s. In 1993, Zhvania was elected General Secretary of Eduard Shevardnadze&#x27;s political party. From that point on until his death in 2006, Zhvania played an important role in Georgian politics. In 1995 he became the chairman of parliament and maintained the post until his resignation in 1999, which was followed with the discharge of other ministers whom Zhvania had suspected of corruption. In 2003, Zhvania united with other opposition leaders, mainly Burdjanadze and Saakashvili, to hold non-violent protests against the rigging of the 2003 presidential elections. This protests culminated with the resignation of Shevardnadze and the ascendance of Saakashvili to the presidency. Zhvania became prime minister and served the post until his death in 2005.

==Early life==
Zhvania was born in Tbilisi into the family of Besarion Zhvania, an ethnic Georgian, and Rema Antonova, of mixed Jewish and Armenian ancestry, both physicists working at the Tbilisi Institute of Physics. In 1985 he graduated from the Faculty of Biology of the Tbilisi State University. He worked at the university through 1992.
In 1993 he married Nino Kadagidze, who owned a book store with English language books in Tbilisi. They had a son and two daughters: Elisabeth, Besarion and Anna. Zhvania spoke Georgian, English, German and Russian.

==Career==
Zhvania entered national politics in 1988. Between 1988 and 1990, Georgia&#x27;s Green Party, which Zhvania co-chaired, was one of a number of opposition groups that took part in the country&#x27;s drive to regain its independence. In September 1991 his party joined the opposition to the first post-Soviet President of Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s violent overthrow in January 1992 resulted in Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, coming to power a few months later. In 1992 Zhvania was elected chairman of Eastern European Greens.

Shevardnadze established the Union of Citizens of Georgia to provide a moderate centre-right grouping for reformist democrats. Zhvania joined the UGC in 1995, entering the Georgian parliament in the same year, and recruited other reformists to the party, notably Mikheil Saakashvili. In 1993, Zhvania became general secretary of Shevardnadze&#x27;s party. On 25 November 1995, after the party&#x27;s victory at the election, he was elected as chairman of the Georgian parliament.

However, Zhvania fell out with Shevardnadze over a corruption scandal and resigned as speaker on 1 November 2001. He and Saakashvili also left Shevardnadze&#x27;s party. In 2002, he established and chaired a new party, called the United Democrats.

Zhvania had a wife and three children, and in addition to his native Georgian, he spoke Armenian, Hebrew, English, German, and Russian. Zurab Zhvania is the only Georgian Prime Minister to have died while in office.

==November elections==

The parliamentary elections of 2 November 2003 were widely condemned by local and international observers as being grossly rigged by the government. In response, Zhvania and other opposition figures called for mass protests against Shevardnadze. Two weeks of massive popular protests followed, forcing Shevardnadze&#x27;s resignation on 23 November. He was replaced on an interim basis by Zhvania&#x27;s successor as parliamentary speaker, Nino Burjanadze. Zhvania himself became a minister in the transitional government prior to fresh presidential elections held on 4 January 2004, which were won by Saakashvili.

==Prime minister==
In February 2004 according to the proposal of President Saakashvili Zhvania was elected as prime minister by the Parliament of Georgia. He led a young reformist cabinet with 15 members with an average age of 35 years. With his cabinet Zhvania was seen as a moderate counterweight to the &quot;radical&quot; attitudes of President Saakashvili. He also was a key figure in the talks on the separatist republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 
Controversial was Zhvania&#x27;s role during the privatisations in Georgia, when he took over all final decisions, while the competent ministers of economy had to be changed three times within two years. Experts also criticized his role in the sale of the port of Batumi and of 16 ships of the Georgian Black Sea fleet.

==Death==

===Circumstances===
Zhvania died early in the morning of 3 February 2005 from what officials claimed was carbon monoxide poisoning caused by an inadequately ventilated gas heater. He was in a rented apartment with Raul Usupov, deputy governor of Georgia&#x27;s Kvemo Kartli region, at the time. Usupov also died. Guards entered the house after there was no word from Zhvania for several hours to find him in an armchair and Usupov in the kitchen. Details of the incident are still limited, although officials have said there was a gas-powered heating stove in the main room of the house, where a table was set up with a backgammon set lying open upon it.

Immediately after the incident, live on Rustavi-2 television, Georgia&#x27;s Interior Minister Vano Merabishvili said there was no reason to suspect foul play. Bodies were taken to the coroner&#x27;s office, where a preliminary examination showed both died from carbon monoxide poisoning. There were reports of serious technical violations when the gas heaters were installed, with officials saying there was no ventilation in the apartment.

However, Zhvania&#x27;s family members have questioned the official version of the death, with Goga Zhvania having said that he was sure that his brother was assassinated. In March 2006 interview with the Washington Post Georgia&#x27;s ex-president Eduard Shevardnadze also said that he believed Zhvania was murdered.

In addition, Irakli Okruashvili has also stated in his scandalous speech in Imedi TV, that Zhvania&#x27;s corpse was moved to the house, but who actually moved the corpse he said he was not going to talk about that any longer that day.

According to some reports Mikheil Machavariani, Deputy Chairman of the Parliament of Georgia, was one of the last people who spoke with Zurab Zhvania the night before his death.

President Mikheil Saakashvili, at an emergency Cabinet meeting, said, &quot;In Zurab Zhvania, Georgia has lost a great patriot, who devoted his entire life to serving the motherland. Zurab&#x27;s death is a great blow to Georgia and to me personally. I lost a very close friend, a reliable adviser and a great ally. I want to call on you all to be strong, because there is no greater responsibility than loyal service to our country and our people.&quot; Rabbi Mikhailashvili stated, &quot;The Jewish community mourns the sudden loss of Zurab Zhvania. As a Jew, he had a close relationship to the Jewish community in Georgia.&quot; As of March 2014 Mikheil Saakashvili was wanted by the Georgian Prosecutor&#x27;s office for questioning in an investigation carried out for the purpose of establishing circumstances surrounding Zhvania&#x27;s death.

===Bodyguard trials and aftermath===

Years after the incident, Zhvania&#x27;s death remains at the center of Georgia&#x27;s political life. In 2015, several of Zhvania&#x27;s bodyguards were convicted of neglect after they admitted that on the day of Zhvania&#x27;s death they had left him alone, at his own request. According to the bodyguards, Zhvania maintained a secret apartment and went to unspecified meetings there, sometimes disguised in a beard. When the security personnel entered the apartment to check on Zhvania, they found his body naked along with the naked Raul Usupov. The bodyguards admitted to tampering with the scene in order to erase any traces that the two men have had sex, so as to &quot;keep his [Zhvania’s] name clean&quot;. Zhvania&#x27;s family members deny allegations of homosexuality and instead insist that it was a staged murder by unspecified persons.

<doc id="378881" wikidata="Q575710" url="?curid=378881" title="Gauss map">
<text>In differential geometry, the Gauss map of a surface is a function that maps each point in the surface to a unit vector that is orthogonal to the surface at that point. Namely, given a surface &quot;X&quot; in Euclidean space R3, the Gauss map is a map &quot;N&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;S&quot;2 (where &quot;S&quot;2 is the unit sphere) such that for each &quot;p&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, the function value &quot;N&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is a unit vector orthogonal to &quot;X&quot; at &quot;p&quot;. The Gauss map is named after Carl F. Gauss.

The Gauss map can be defined (globally) if and only if the surface is orientable, in which case its degree is half the Euler characteristic. The Gauss map can always be defined locally (i.e. on a small piece of the surface). The Jacobian determinant of the Gauss map is equal to Gaussian curvature, and the differential of the Gauss map is called the shape operator.

Gauss first wrote a draft on the topic in 1825 and published in 1827.

There is also a Gauss map for a link, which computes linking number.

==Generalizations==

The Gauss map can be defined for hypersurfaces in R&quot;n&quot; as a map from a hypersurface to the unit sphere &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1  ⊆  R&quot;n&quot;.

For a general oriented &quot;k&quot;-submanifold of R&quot;n&quot; the Gauss map can also be defined, and its target space is the &quot;oriented&quot; Grassmannian 
formula_1, i.e. the set of all oriented &quot;k&quot;-planes in R&quot;n&quot;. In this case a point on the submanifold is mapped to its oriented tangent subspace. One can also map to its oriented &quot;normal&quot; subspace; these are equivalent as formula_2 via orthogonal complement.
In Euclidean 3-space, this says that an oriented 2-plane is characterized by an oriented 1-line, equivalently a unit normal vector (as formula_3), hence this is consistent with the definition above.

Finally, the notion of Gauss map can be generalized to an oriented submanifold &quot;X&quot; of dimension &quot;k&quot; in an oriented ambient Riemannian manifold &quot;M&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot;. In that case, the Gauss map then goes from &quot;X&quot; to the set of tangent &quot;k&quot;-planes in the tangent bundle &quot;TM&quot;. The target space for the Gauss map &quot;N&quot; is a Grassmann bundle built on the tangent bundle &quot;TM&quot;. In the case where formula_4, the tangent bundle is trivialized (so the Grassmann bundle becomes a map to the Grassmannian), and we recover the previous definition.

==Total curvature==
The area of the image of the Gauss map is called the total curvature and is equivalent to the surface integral of the Gaussian curvature. This is the original interpretation given by Gauss. 

formula_5

The Gauss–Bonnet theorem links total curvature of a surface to its topological properties.
==Cusps of the Gauss map==
The Gauss map reflects many properties of the surface: when the surface has zero Gaussian curvature, (that is along a parabolic line) the Gauss map will have a fold catastrophe. This fold may contain cusps and these cusps were studied in depth by Thomas Banchoff, Terence Gaffney and Clint McCrory. Both parabolic lines and cusp are stable phenomena and will remain under slight deformations of the surface. Cusps occur when:
#The surface has a bi-tangent plane
#A ridge crosses a parabolic line
#at the closure of the set of inflection points of the asymptotic curves of the surface.
There are two types of cusp: &quot;elliptic cusp&quot; and &quot;hyperbolic cusps&quot;.
