Despite most of his songs being written by Akio Inoue and composed/arranged by Daisuke Asakura (also TMR&#x27;s former producer), T.M.Revolution is considered Nishikawa&#x27;s solo project. Nishikawa is also known for contributions of ending and opening themes to many notable anime and game series.

After three years as vocalist of the visual kei rock band Luis-Mary, Nishikawa debuted as TMR with the release of his first solo single in May 1996. Later that year, his third single was used as the third ending song for the anime series &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, further expanding his fan base.

Nishikawa has guest starred as a minor character in each of those anime series that featured his songs. In 2010, his single &quot;Save the One, Save the All&quot; was used as the ending theme song for the movie &quot;&quot;. Several of Nishikawa&#x27;s songs, such as &quot;Crosswise&quot; and &quot;Flags&quot;, have been used by Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Sengoku Basara&quot; video game series and media franchise.

(Orange is Nishikawa&#x27;s favourite colour.) , an album track from &quot;coordinate&quot;, was used as an insert song to &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;. The album mix of &quot;THUNDERBIRD&quot;, originally from &quot;the force&quot;, was also included on this album. Later that year, Nishikawa became the first artist to be signed under Tofu Records, and &quot;coordinate&quot; was the first album released by Tofu.

Nishikawa was asked to sing the ending theme song of the Japanese theatrical release of &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (&quot;Web of Night&quot;), because of his performance at PMX 2004 and his relations at Sony Music Japan. &quot;Web of Night&quot;, released in late July 2004, also included a rearrangement of &quot;Tears Macerate Reason&quot; (originally from &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot;) and an English version of the song (translated by Lynne Hobday).

It was #53 on the 2004 Oricon Top 100 Singles chart, having sold 161,324 copies. Nishikawa also voice acted as Heine Westenfluss for several episodes of &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;. His character was directly modelled after Nishikawa himself, as opposed to Miguel Aiman of &quot;SEED&quot;. Heine&#x27;s hairstyle resembled Nishikawa&#x27;s Luis-Mary hairstyle, and his name was a play on Nishikawa&#x27;s pseudonym with that band (Haine). [Heine&#x27;s first name is written as in katakana.] The surnames of both Nishikawa and Westenfluss mean &quot;west river&quot; in Japanese (西川) and German (Westenfluß), respectively. &quot;Ignited&quot;&#x27;s title is closely similar to the mobile suit (GOUF Ignited) that Nishikawa&#x27;s &quot;GSD&quot; character piloted.

&quot;Vertical infinity&quot; was released on January 26, 2005, by Epic and exactly six months later by Tofu Records.

These songs would be rearranged and re-recorded. Ten songs were originally planned for this album, but due to the overwhelming number of votes, fifteen tracks were recorded instead.

<text>Governments and private organizations have developed car classification schemes that are used for various purposes including regulation, description, and categorization of cars.

The International Standard ISO 3833-1977 &quot;Road vehicles – Types – Terms and definitions&quot; also defines terms for classifying cars.

== Summary of classifications ==
The following table summarises the commonly used terms of market segments and legal classifications.
== Market segments ==
=== Microcar / kei car ===

Microcars and their Japanese equivalent— kei cars— are the smallest category of automobile.

Microcars straddle the boundary between car and motorbike, and are often covered by separate regulations from normal cars, resulting in relaxed requirements for registration and licensing. Engine size is often or less, and microcars have three or four wheels.

Microcars are most popular in Europe, where they originated following World War II. The predecessors to micro cars are voiturettes and cycle cars. Kei cars have been used in Japan since 1949.

Examples of microcars and kei cars:

* Honda Life
* Smart ForTwo
* Tata Nano

=== A-segment / City car / Minicompact ===

The smallest category of vehicles that are registered as normal cars is called A-segment in Europe, or &quot;city car&quot; in Europe and the United States. The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines this category as &quot;minicompact.&quot; However, this term is not widely used.

The equivalents of A-segment cars have been produced since the early 1920s. However, the category increased in popularity in the late 1950s when the original Fiat 500 and BMC Mini were released.

Examples of A-segment / city cars / minicompact cars:
* Fiat 500
* Hyundai i10
* Toyota Aygo

=== B-segment / Supermini / Subcompact ===

The next larger category of small cars is called B-segment Europe, supermini in the United Kingdom and subcompact in the United States.

The size of a subcompact car is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as having a combined interior and cargo volume of between . Since the EPA&#x27;s smaller minicompact category is not as commonly used by the general public, A-segment cars are sometimes called subcompacts in the United States. In Europe and Great Britain, the B-segment and supermini categories do not have any formal definitions based on size.

Early supermini cars in Great Britain include the 1977 Ford Fiesta and Vauxhall Chevette.

In the United States, the first locally-built subcompact cars were the 1970 AMC Gremlin, Chevrolet Vega, and Ford Pinto.

Examples of B-segment / supermini / subcompact cars:
* Chevrolet Aveo (Chevrolet Sonic)
* Hyundai Accent
* Volkswagen Polo

=== C-segment / Small family / Compact ===

The largest category of small cars is called &quot;C-segment&quot; or &quot;small family car&quot; in Europe, and &quot;compact car&quot; in the United States.

The size of a compact car is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as having a combined interior and cargo volume of .

Examples of C-segment / compact / small family cars:
* Honda Civic
* Toyota Corolla
* Renault Mégane

=== D-segment / Large family / Mid-size ===

In Europe, the third-largest category for passenger cars is called &quot;D-segment&quot; or &quot;large family car&quot;.

In the United States, the equivalent term is &quot;mid-size&quot; or &quot;intermediate&quot; cars. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines a mid-size car as having a combined passenger and cargo volume of .

Examples of D-segment / large family / mid-size cars:
* Chevrolet Malibu
* Ford Mondeo
* Kia K5

=== E-segment / Executive / Full-size ===

In Europe, the second-largest category for passenger cars is E-segment / executive car, which are usually luxury cars.

In other countries, the equivalent terms are &quot;full-size car&quot; or &quot;large car&quot;, which are also used for relatively affordable large cars that are not considered luxury cars.

Examples of non-luxury full-size cars:
* Chevrolet Impala
* Toyota Avalon
=== F-segment / Luxury saloon / Full-size luxury ===
&quot;See Luxury saloon / full-size luxury section below.&quot;
=== S-segment / Sports / Performance cars ===
&quot;See Sports / performance cars section below.&quot;

== Minivans / MPVs ==
Minivan is an American car classification for vehicles that are designed to transport passengers in the rear seating rows, and have reconfigurable seats in two or three rows. The equivalent terms in British English are multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), people carrier, and people mover. Minivans are often of the &quot;one-box&quot; or &quot;two-box&quot; body configuration, high roofs, flat floors, sliding doors for rear passengers, and high H-point seating.

=== Mini MPV ===

Mini MPV is the smallest size of MPVs and the vehicles are often built on the platforms of B-segment hatchback models.

Examples of Mini MPVs:
* Fiat 500L
* Honda Freed
* Ford B-Max

=== Compact MPV ===

The compact MPV size class includes vehicles between the mini MPV and large MPV (minivan) sizes. Compact MPVs remain predominantly a European phenomenon, although they are also built and sold in many Latin American and Asian markets.

Examples of Compact MPVs:
* Renault Scénic
* Volkswagen Touran
* Ford C-Max

=== Large MPV ===

The largest size of minivans is also referred to as &quot;large MPV&quot; and became popular following the introduction of the 1984 Renault Espace and Dodge Caravan. Since the 1990s, the smaller compact MPV and mini MPV sizes of minivans have also become popular. If the term &quot;minivan&quot; is used without specifying a size, it usually refers to a large MPV.

Examples of Large MPVs:
* Chrysler Pacifica
* Ford S-Max
* Toyota Sienna

== Luxury vehicles ==
=== Premium compact ===

The premium compact class (also called subcompact executive) is the smallest category of luxury cars. It became popular in the mid-2000s, when European manufacturers — such as Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz — introduced new entry-level models that were smaller and cheaper than their compact executive models.

Examples of premium compact cars:
* Acura ILX
* Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class
* Lexus CT200h
=== Compact executive / luxury compact ===

A compact executive car or a compact luxury car is a premium car larger than a &quot;premium compact&quot; and smaller than an &quot;executive car&quot;. Compact executive cars are equivalent size to mid-size cars and are part of the D-segment in the European car classification.

In North American terms, close equivalents are &quot;luxury compact&quot; and &quot;entry-level luxury car&quot;, although the latter is also used for the smaller &quot;premium compact cars&quot;.

Examples of compact executive cars:
* Audi A4
* BMW 3 Series
* Volvo S60

=== Executive / mid-size luxury ===

An executive car is a premium car larger than a &quot;compact executive&quot; and smaller than a &quot;full-size luxury&quot; car. Executive cars are classified as E-segment cars in the European car classification.

In the United States and several other countries, the equivalent categories are full-size car (not to be confused with the European category of &quot;full-size luxury car&quot;) or &quot;mid-size luxury&quot; car.

Examples of executive cars:
* Mercedes-Benz E-Class
* Lexus GS
* Volvo S90

=== Luxury saloon / full-size luxury ===

The largest size of a luxury car is known as a &quot;luxury saloon&quot; in the United Kingdom and a &quot;full-size luxury car&quot; in the United States. These cars are classified as F-segment cars in the European car classification.

Vehicles in this category are often the flagship models of luxury car brands.

Examples of luxury saloons:
* BMW 7 Series
* Lincoln Continental
* Lexus LS

== Sports / performance cars ==
Cars that prioritize handling or straight-line acceleration are called sports cars or performance cars. However the term &quot;sports car&quot; is also sometimes used specifically for lightweight two-seat cars. Sports/performance cars can either be built on unique platforms or upgraded versions of regular cars.

Common categories of sports/performance cars are:

*sports car
*sports sedan / sports saloon
*supercar
*hypercar
*hot hatch
*sport compact
*muscle car
*pony car
*grand tourer

The definitions for these categories are often blurred and a car may be a member of multiple categories.

=== Sports car ===

Sports cars are designed to emphasize handling, performance, or the thrill of driving. Sports cars originated in Europe in the early 1900s, with one of the first recorded usages of the term &quot;sports car&quot; being in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in the United Kingdom in 1919. Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s. The term was originally used for two-seat roadsters (cars without fixed roofs). However, since the 1970s the term has also been used for cars with fixed roofs (which were previously considered grand tourers).

Examples of sports cars:
* Chevrolet Corvette
* Mazda MX-5
* Porsche 911

=== Sports sedan / sports saloon ===
A &quot;sports sedan&quot; — also known as &quot;sports saloon&quot; — is a subjective term for a sedan/saloon car that is designed to have sporting performance or handling characteristics.

Examples of sports sedans:
* BMW M5
* Mazdaspeed6 / Mazda 6 MPS
* Dodge Charger

=== Supercar / hypercar ===

A supercar – also called an exotic car – is a loosely defined description of certain high-performance sportscars. Since the 1990s or 2000s, the term &quot;hypercar&quot; has come into use for the highest-performing supercars.

Examples of supercars:
* McLaren P1
* Koenigsegg Agera R
* Bugatti Veyron 16.4
== SUVs / off-road vehicles ==
Passenger vehicles with off-road capability or styling features are often categorized as either off-road vehicles, sports utility vehicles, or crossover SUVs. There are no commonly agreed boundaries between these categories, and usage of the terms varies between countries.

=== Off-road vehicle ===

The earliest type of passenger vehicle is called an &quot;off-roader&quot;, &quot;four-by-four&quot; or &quot;four-wheel drive&quot;. Off-road vehicles are usually more focused on off-road capability than SUVs and crossover SUVs (often compromising their on-road ride quality or handling). Common features of off-road vehicles are four-wheel drive, high ground clearance, a body-on-frame (separate chassis) construction and low-range gearing.

Examples of off-road vehicles:
* Nissan Patrol
* Toyota Land Cruiser
* Suzuki Jimny
=== Sport utility vehicle ===

A sports utility vehicle (SUV) combines elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles, such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive.

There is no common definition of an SUV, and usage varies between countries. Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a light-truck chassis. However, a broader definition considers any vehicle with off-road design features as an SUV. In some countries — such as the United States — SUVs have been classified as &quot;light trucks&quot;, resulting in more lenient regulations compared to passenger cars.

The predecessors to SUVs date back to military and low-volume models from the late 1930s, and the four-wheel drive station wagons / carryalls that began to be introduced in 1949. The 1984 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) is considered to be the first SUV in the modern style. Most SUVs produced today use unibody construction (as per passenger cars). However, in the past, many SUVs used body-on-frame construction.

Examples of SUVs:
* Chevrolet Tahoe
* Mercedes-Benz M-Class
* Mitsubishi Pajero
=== Crossover SUV ===

A crossover SUV— also called a crossover or CUV— is a type of sports utility vehicle (SUV) that uses a unibody construction. Crossovers are often based on a platform shared with a passenger car, as a result, they typically have better comfort and fuel economy, but less off-road capability (many crossovers are sold without all-wheel drive) than truck-based SUVs, though more so than passenger cars.

There are various inconsistencies about whether vehicles are considered crossovers or SUVs, therefore the term SUV is often used as a catch-all for both crossovers and SUVs.

Examples of crossover SUVs:
* Nissan Qashqai
*Volkswagen Tiguan
* Mazda CX60
== Government classification methods ==

These classifications can be based on body style (e.g. sedan, coupe or hatchback), number of doors or seating capacity.

Government departments often create classification systems for taxation or regulating vehicle usage (e.g. vehicles that require a specific license or are restricted to certain roads). Some jurisdictions may determine vehicle tax based upon environmental principles, such as the user pays principle.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries publishes its classifications.

=== Canada ===
A similar set of classes is used by the Canadian EPA. The Canadian National Collision Database (NCDB) system defines &quot;passenger car&quot; as a unique class, but also identifies two other categories involving passenger vehicles—the &quot;passenger van&quot; and &quot;light utility vehicle&quot;—and these categories are inconsistently handled across the country with the boundaries between the vehicles increasingly blurred.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, a vehicle is taxed according to the vehicle&#x27;s construction, engine, weight, type of fuel, and emissions, as well as the purpose for which it is used.

=== United States ===
In the United States, since 2010 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has used a formula it developed that takes into account a combination of both vehicle footprint (length times width) and weight.



The United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) separates vehicles into classes by the curb weight of the vehicle with standard equipment including the maximum capacity of fuel, oil, coolant, and air conditioning, if so equipped.

The United States Federal Highway Administration has developed a classification system used for automatically calculating road use tolls. There are two broad categories depending on whether the vehicle carries passengers or commodities. Vehicles that carry commodities are further subdivided by the number of axles and number of units, including both power and trailer units.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has developed a classification system used to compare fuel economy among similar vehicles. Passenger vehicles are classified based on a vehicle&#x27;s total interior passenger and cargo volumes. Trucks are classified based on their gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). Heavy-duty vehicles are not included in the EPA scheme.

Certain cities in the United States in the 1920s chose to exempt electric-powered vehicles because officials believed those vehicles did not cause &quot;substantial wear upon the pavements&quot;.

== North American market segments ==
Several other segment descriptions, listed below, are used in North America. Cars from these segments may also be sold in other countries. However, the usage of the terms is mostly specific to North America.

=== Muscle car ===

Muscle car is an American term for high-performance cars, usually rear-wheel drive and fitted with a large and powerful V8 engine. The term originated for the 1960s and early 1970s special editions of mass-production cars which were designed for drag racing.

Examples of muscle cars:
* Ford Torino
* Plymouth Road Runner
* Pontiac GTO
=== Pony car ===

Pony car is an American class of automobile launched and inspired by the Ford Mustang in 1964. It broke all post-World War II automobile sales records, &quot;creating the &#x27;pony car&#x27; craze soon adopted by competitors.&quot; The term describes an affordable, compact, highly styled car with a sporty or performance-oriented image.

Examples of pony cars:
* AMC Javelin
* Chevrolet Camaro
* Dodge Challenger
=== Personal luxury car ===

A personal luxury car is a North American market segment for premium coupé or convertible produced from 1952–2007. These two-door cars prioritized comfort, styling, and a high level of interior features. Not prioritizing maximum interior space, interior volumes are equivalent size to mid-size cars and are part of the D-segment in the European car classification, and exterior dimensions can exceed F-segment.

Examples of personal luxury cars:
* Ford Thunderbird
* Cadillac Eldorado
* Chrysler Cordoba

=== Sport compact ===
A sporting version of an affordable compact car or a subcompact car. There is no precise definition and the description is applied for marketing purposes to a wide variety of models.

Cars began to be marketed as sport compacts in the mid-1980s when it was used for option packages on American-built coupes. Since then, it has also been used for standalone sports car models and cars imported from Europe and Asia.

The European equivalent is a hot hatch. However, sport compacts are not restricted to just hatchback body styles.

Examples of sport compact cars:
* Chevrolet Cavalier Z24
* Ford Probe
* Honda Civic Si

== European market segments ==
Several other segment descriptions, listed below, are used in Europe. Cars from these segments may also be sold in other countries. However, the usage of the terms is mostly specific to Europe.

=== Grand tourer ===

A grand tourer (GT) is a car that is designed for high-speed and long-distance driving, due to a combination of performance and luxury attributes. The most common format is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive two-door coupé with either a two-seat or a 2+2 arrangement.

The term derives from the Italian language phrase &quot;gran turismo&quot; which became popular in the English language from the 1950s, evolving from fast touring cars and streamlined closed sports cars during the 1930s.

Examples of grand tourers:
* Aston Martin Vanquish
* Lexus SC300/400
* Ferrari FF
=== Hot hatch ===

Hot hatch (shortened from hot hatchback) is a high-performance version of a mass-produced hatchback car.

The term originated in the mid-1980s. However, factory high-performance versions of hatchbacks have been produced since the 1970s.

Front-mounted petrol engines, together with front-wheel drive, are the most common powertrain layout. However, all-wheel drive has become more commonly used since around 2010. Most hot hatches are manufactured in Europe or Asia.

Examples of hot hatches:
* Volkswagen Golf GTi
* Peugeot 205 GTi
* Honda Civic Type R

<text>Aldersgate is a Ward of the City of London, England, named after one of the northern gates in the London Wall which once enclosed the City.

The Ward of Aldersgate is traditionally divided into Aldersgate Within and Aldersgate Without, the suffix denoting whether the part was within the line of the wall or outside it. The ancient ward boundaries were redrawn in 2013; the names are preserved but their location only loosely approximates to their historic extent.

The gate also gave its name to Aldersgate Street, which runs north from the former gate towards Clerkenwell. The street was wholly part of Aldersgate Without ward until a short section further north was renamed and so added to it.

==The gate==

The Wall was first built around the year 200, but Aldersgate was not one of the original Roman gates, being added later in the Roman period.

The name &quot;Aldersgate&quot; is first recorded around 1000 in the form &quot;Ealdredesgate&quot;, i.e. &quot;gate associated with a man named Ealdrād&quot;; the gate probably acquired its name in the late Saxon period.

When James VI of Scotland came to England to take the crowns of both England and Scotland in 1603, he entered the City at Aldersgate. Statues of the king were placed both outside (on horseback) and inside (seated on the throne) the gate to commemorate the occasion.

The old gate was taken down in 1617, and rebuilt in the same year from a design by Gerard Christmas. The gate was damaged in the Great Fire of London in 1666 but was repaired and remained until 1761. Aldersgate Street contained the Bishop of London&#x27;s chapel and his chambers at London House, which was used from the 18th century because it was closer to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral than his official residence in Fulham.

==Ward of Aldersgate==
The ward of Aldersgate straddles the (now former) line of London Wall and the old gate and historically was divided into &quot;Within&quot; and &quot;Without&quot; divisions, with a deputy (alderman) appointed for each division. There is now only one deputy alderman for the ward.

===Geography===
====Aldersgate Within====
The &quot;Within&quot; division was focussed on the buildings on each side of St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand (which extends northward as Aldersgate Street), Noble Street and Foster Lane.

The ward took in the liberty of St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand when that was disestablished in the 16th century.

====Aldersgate Without====
&quot;Aldersgate Without&quot; was, at an early date, part of an area outside the northern wall called the Soke of Cripplegate, held by the church of St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand. The &quot;Without&quot; division was coterminous with that part of the Ancient Parish of St Botolph Without Aldersgate that was part of the City. The area included the parish church of St Botolph&#x27;s Aldersgate and the adjacent Postman&#x27;s Park, named after the former principal sorting office in King Edward Street, and the location of the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice.

The church outside Aldersgate was one of four London churches dedicated to Saint Botolph, a 7th-century English saint. By the end of the 11th century Botolph was regarded as the patron saint of boundaries, and by extension of trade and travel.

The division was mainly focussed on the buildings on each side of Aldersgate street and included the western part of the Barbican Estate (including the Museum of London), two livery company halls (the Ironmongers&#x27; Hall and the Plaisterers&#x27; Hall) as well as 200 Aldersgate, a large office complex at the southern end of the street.

====Post-2013 ward====
Since ward boundary changes in 2013, almost all of the ward is Without and the former liberty and street of St. Martin&#x27;s is no longer within the ward&#x27;s boundaries.

The much-altered new ward of Aldersgate is bounded by Aldersgate Street, Beech Street, Noble Street, Angel Street, King Edward Street and Montague Street.

====Aldersgate Street====
Aldersgate Street forms a short section of the A1 route towards Edinburgh. It is located on the west side of the Barbican Estate and Barbican Centre, near St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital and the Museum of London from its opening in 1976 until it closed in December 2022 prior to its move to Smithfield Market (during which time it fell within the ward).

Northbound it continues into Goswell Road at the junction with Fann Street; southbound it continues into St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand. Barbican Underground station is located on Aldersgate Street and when it was opened in 1865 was named Aldersgate Street tube station. In 1910 it was renamed Aldersgate, then Aldersgate &amp; Barbican in 1924, before finally being renamed Barbican in 1968.

Originally Aldersgate Street only corresponded to the section starting from the church of St Botolph without Aldersgate towards Long Lane. The portion of the road from Long Lane till Goswell Street (after 1864 Goswell Road) was formerly named Pickax Street, where today is located the Barbican tube station. This name may derive from Pickt Hatch, an area of brothels said to be in this part of London during the Elizabethan era. Pick Hatch is mentioned in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (&quot;Goe ... to your Mannor of Pickt-hatch&quot;) and in &quot;The Alchemist&quot; (&quot;The decay&#x27;d Vestalls of Pickt-hatch&quot;). By the late eighteenth century the name Pickax was no more in use, and the road was fully incorporated into Aldersgate Street.

===Politics===
Aldersgate is one of 25 wards of the City of London, each electing an alderman to the Court of Aldermen and commoners (the City equivalent of a councillor) to the Court of Common Council of the City of London Corporation. Only electors who are Freemen of the City of London are eligible to stand.

In the 2017 City-wide Common Council elections, the Labour Party won one seat in Aldersgate ward with local resident Richard Crossan standing for Labour and being elected unopposed. The Labour Party won a record total of five seats on the Common Council in March 2017 winning two seats in Portsoken, two seats in Cripplegate ward and one seat in Aldersgate ward.

Current elected representatives in Aldersgate, following the 2022 Common Council election and Aldermanic election are Christopher Makin (Alderman), Randall Anderson (Deputy), Naresh Sonpar, Steve Goodman, Helen Fentiman, Deborah Oliver and Anett Ridegg.

===History===
The wards of London appear to have taken shape in the 11th century, before the Norman Conquest. Their administrative, judicial and military purpose made them equivalent to Hundreds in the countryside. The primary purpose of wards like Aldersgate, which included a gate, appears to be the defence of the gate, as gates were the weakest points in any fortification.

The ward initially only included land within the walls, but a degree of growth beyond the gate meant some of the land beyond came under the sway of the City. Boundary markers – bars – were established here and elsewhere with the suburb eventually becoming part of the City. Aldersgate Bars are recorded as early as 1197.

A mansion above Aldersgate, referred to as Aldrichgate, was gifted to John Blytone, the earliest known sword-bearer of the City of London when he resigned from the service of the Lord Mayor of London in 1395.

====Religion====
In 1554 Aldersgate Street was the scene of a fraud where Elizabeth Crofts was smuggled into a wall to pretend to be a heavenly voice. Reputedly 17,000 people came to listen to her give out anti-Catholic propaganda.

The house of Sarah Sawyer, in Rose and Rainbow Court (approximately the site of the present Museum of London), formed one of the earliest Quaker meetings in London (before 1655). In 1675, it became a dedicated meeting house, the Box Meeting, used mainly by Quaker women for poor relief, on her marriage.
28 Aldersgate Street is the approximate former location of a Moravian Church. On 24 May 1738, attending a meeting at the church, the clergyman John Wesley underwent a profound religious experience. The following year, he broke with the Moravians and founded the Methodist Society of England. The yearly anniversary of his experience is celebrated by Methodists as Aldersgate Day. Wesley&#x27;s Chapel, in nearby City Road, remains a major focal point of the worldwide Methodist movement.

====The arts====
The poet Thomas Flatman was born in a house in Aldersgate Street in 1633. As with most historic buildings on this stretch of road, the building no longer stands. At Nos. 35-38 stood Shaftesbury House, built around 1644 by Inigo Jones. It was demolished in 1882. Lauderdale House was demolished in 1708, the London home of the Duke of Lauderdale and earlier the house of his mother-in-law, the Countess of Home.

No. 134 for many years had a sign claiming: &quot;This was Shakespeare&#x27;s House&quot;. Although the building was very close to the nearby Fortune Playhouse, there is no documentary evidence surviving to indicate that Shakespeare resided here; a subsidy roll from 1598 shows a &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; as owner of the property, but there is nothing to indicate that it is the playwright. The building no longer exists, and Barbican station now occupies the site. The nearby Shakespeare Tower is named for this (tenuous) connection. At the point where Aldersgate Street changes its name to Goswell Road there is also a public house &quot;The Shakespeare&quot;.

====Lost buildings====

Adjacent to the modern roundabout on the site of the gate was the former headquarters of the General Post Office (closed in 1910 and demolished shortly afterwards), and the adjoining Postman&#x27;s Park. The southern part of the roundabout and the northern part of where the Post Office once stood are located on the site of a collegiate church and sanctuary founded in 750 by Withu, King of Kent, hugely expanded in 1056 by Ingebrian, Earl of Essex, and issued with a royal charter in 1068 by William the Conqueror. The site of the church was cleared in 1818 in preparation for the construction of the Post Office.

Most of the buildings on Aldersgate Street were destroyed or badly damaged in the Second World War. The entire length of the eastern side of the street is now occupied by a part of the Barbican residential and arts complex.

At the corner in between Aldersgate Street and Long Lane, opposite to the now Barbican station and Beech Street, stood the &quot;Manchester Hotel&quot; with over 240 rooms. It used to be a Victorian landmark in the area, popular with business men, visitors and juries attending trials at the Old Bailey.
Opened in 1879, refurbished and modernised in 1921, suffered severe damages by the Second World War bombs and was consequently demolished. 
After the First World War it was temporary closed, and commanded by the government as a hostel for Jewish refugees escaping Poland and Belgium.
Advertisement of the hotel regularly featured on local magazines and periodicals referring to its splendid rooms, wine cellar, luncheon for City workers, and as a venue for wedding receptions.

<text>Post-polio syndrome (PPS, poliomyelitis sequelae) is a group of latent symptoms of poliomyelitis (polio), occurring in more than 80% of polio infections. The symptoms are caused by the damaging effects of the viral infection on the nervous system and typically occur 15 to 30 years after an initial acute paralytic attack. Symptoms include decreasing muscular function or acute weakness with pain and fatigue. The same may also occur years after a nonparalytic polio infection.

The precise mechanism that causes PPS is unknown. It shares many features with chronic fatigue syndrome, but unlike that disorder it tends to be progressive and can cause loss of muscle strength. Treatment is primarily limited to adequate rest, conservation of available energy, and supportive measures, such as leg braces and energy-saving devices such as powered wheelchairs, analgesia (pain relief), and sleep aids.

==Signs and symptoms==
After a period of prolonged stability, some people who recover from polio infections begin to experience new signs and symptoms, characterised by muscular atrophy, weakness, pain, and limb fatigue. PPS is a very slowly progressing condition marked by periods of stability followed by new declines in the ability to carry out usual daily activities. Most patients become aware of their decreased capacity to carry out daily routines due to significant changes in mobility and decreasing upper limb function and lung capability. Fatigue is often the most disabling symptom; even slight exertion often produces disabling fatigue and can also intensify other symptoms. Problems breathing or swallowing, sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea, and decreased tolerance for cold temperatures are other notable symptoms.

Increased activity during healthy years between the original infection and onset of PPS can amplify the symptoms. Thus, contracting polio at a young age can result in particularly disabling PPS symptoms.

A possible early occurring and long-lasting sign is a slight jitter exhibited in handwriting.

==Mechanism==
Numerous theories have been proposed to explain post-polio syndrome. Despite this, no absolutely defined causes of PPS are known. The most widely accepted theory of the mechanism behind the disorder is &quot;neural fatigue&quot;. A motor unit is a nerve cell (or neuron) and the muscle fibers it activates. Poliovirus attacks specific neurons in the brainstem and the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, generally resulting in the death of a substantial fraction of the motor neurons controlling skeletal muscles. In an effort to compensate for the loss of these neurons, surviving motor neurons sprout new nerve terminals to the orphaned muscle fibers. The result is some recovery of movement and the development of enlarged motor units.

The neural fatigue theory proposes that the enlargement of the motor neuron fibers places added metabolic stress on the nerve cell body to nourish the additional fibers. After years of use, this stress may be more than the neuron can handle, leading to the gradual deterioration of the sprouted fibers, and eventually, the neuron itself. This causes muscle weakness and paralysis. Restoration of nerve function may occur in some fibers a second time, but eventually, nerve terminals malfunction and permanent weakness occurs. When these neurons no longer carry on sprouting, fatigue occurs due to the increasing metabolic demand of the nervous system. The normal aging process also may play a role. Denervation and reinnervation are going on, but the reinnervation process has an upper limit where the reinnervation cannot compensate for the ongoing denervation, and loss of motor units takes place. What disturbs the denervation-reinnervation equilibrium and causes peripheral denervation, though, is still unclear. With age, most people experience a decrease in the number of spinal motor neurons. Because polio survivors have already lost a considerable number of motor neurons, further age-related loss of neurons may contribute substantially to new muscle weakness. The overuse and underuse of muscles also may contribute to muscle weakness.

Another theory is that people who have recovered from polio lose remaining healthy neurons at a faster rate than normal. Little evidence exists to support this idea. Finally, the initial polio infection is thought to cause an autoimmune reaction, in which the body&#x27;s immune system attacks normal cells as if they were foreign substances. Again, compared to neural fatigue, the evidence supporting this theory is quite limited.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of PPS can be difficult, since the symptoms are hard to separate from complications due to the original polio infection, and from the normal infirmities of aging. No laboratory test for post-polio syndrome is known, nor are any other specific diagnostic criteria. Three important criteria are recognized, including previous diagnosis of polio, long interval after recovery, and gradual onset of weakness.

In general, PPS is a diagnosis of exclusion whereby other possible causes of the symptoms are eliminated. Neurological examination aided by other laboratory studies can help to determine what component of a neuromuscular deficit occurred with polio and what components are new and to exclude all other possible diagnoses. Objective assessment of muscle strength in PPS patients may not be easy. Changes in muscle strength are determined in specific muscle groups using various muscle scales that quantify strength, such as the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. Magnetic resonance imaging, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological studies, muscle biopsies, or spinal fluid analysis may also be useful in establishing a PPS diagnosis.

==Management==
PPS treatment concerns comfort (relieving pain via analgesics) and rest (via use of mechanisms to make life easier, such as a powered wheelchair) and is generally of palliative care. No reversive therapies are known. Fatigue is usually the most disabling symptom. Energy conservation can significantly reduce fatigue episodes. Such can be achieved by lifestyle changes, such as additional (daytime) sleep, reducing workload, and weight loss for obesity. Some require lower-limb orthotics to reduce energy usage.

Medications for fatigue, such as amantadine and pyridostigmine, are ineffective in the management of PPS. Muscle strength and endurance training are more important in managing the symptoms of PPS than the ability to perform enduring aerobic activity. Management should focus on treatments such as hydrotherapy and developing other routines that encourage strength, but do not affect fatigue levels. A recent trend toward use of intravenous immunoglobulin, which had yielded promising albeit modest results, but proves insufficient to recommend as a treatment.

PPS increasingly stresses the musculoskeletal system from progressive muscular atrophy. In a review of 539 PPS patients, 80% reported pain in muscles and joints and 87% had fatigue. Joint instability can cause appreciable pain and should be adequately treated with painkillers. Directed activity, such as decreasing mechanical stress with braces and adaptive equipment, is recommended.

Because PPS can fatigue facial muscles, as well as cause dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dysarthria (difficulty speaking) or aphonia (inability to produce speech), sufferers may become malnourished from difficulty eating. Compensatory routines can help relieve these symptoms, such as eating smaller portions at a time and sitting down whilst eating. PPS with respiratory involvement requires exceptional therapy management, such as breathing exercises and chest percussion to expel secretions (clearing of the lungs) on a periodic basis (monitored via stethoscope). Failure to properly assess PPS with respiratory involvement can increase the risk of overlooking an aspiration pneumonia (a life-threatening infection of the lower respiratory tract, especially so if not caught early on). Severe cases may require permanent ventilation or tracheostomy. Sleep apnoea may also occur. Other management strategies that show improvement include smoking cessation, treatment of other respiratory diseases, and vaccination against respiratory infections such as influenza.

==Prognosis==
In general, PPS is not life-threatening. The major exception is patients left with severe residual respiratory difficulties, who may experience new severe respiratory impairment. Compared to control populations, PPS patients lack any elevation of antibodies against the poliovirus, and because no poliovirus is excreted in the feces, it is not considered a recurrence of the original polio. Further, no evidence has shown that the poliovirus can cause a persistent infection in humans. PPS has been confused with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which progressively weakens muscles. PPS patients do not have an elevated risk of ALS.

No sufficient longitudinal studies have been conducted on the prognosis of PPS, but speculations have been made by several physicians based on experience. Fatigue and mobility usually return to normal over a long period of time. The prognosis also differs depending upon different causes and factors affecting the patient. An overall mortality rate of 25% exists due to possible respiratory paralysis; otherwise, it is usually not lethal.

Prognosis can be abruptly changed for the worse by the use of anesthesia, such as during surgery.

==Epidemiology==
Old data show PPS occurs in roughly 25 to 50% of people who survive a polio infection. Newer data from countries that asked their polio survivors show 85% of respondents have symptoms of post-polio syndrome. Typically, it occurs 30–35 years afterward, but delays between 8 and 71 years have been recorded. The disease occurs sooner in those with more severe initial infections. Other factors that increase the risk of PPS include increasing length of time since acute poliovirus infection, presence of permanent residual impairment after recovery from the acute illness, and being female. PPS is documented to occur in cases of nonparalytic polio (NPP). One review states late-onset weakness and fatigue occur in 14–42% of NPP patients.

<text>Drei Schwestern (The Three Sisters) is a mountain located on the border of Austria and Liechtenstein. It forms a natural boundary between Liechtenstein and the Austrian state of Vorarlberg.

The Three Sisters are a three-peaked mountain chain in the Rätikon, a mountain range of the Western Central Alps. The highest peak, the &quot;Great Sister&quot;, is above sea level. The &quot;Middle Sister&quot;, located north-east of it reaches a height of , and the north-eastern &quot;Little Sister&quot; high.

The three peaks mark the border between Feldkirch in Austria and Liechtenstein. Through a well-developed road system, they are easily accessible and are often climbed.

The first ascent was probably made by hunters. The first recorded ascent was on 10 June 1870 by John Sholto Douglass from Thüringen, Vorarlberg, with a hunter named Wieser from Frastanz.

== Location and surroundings ==
The chain of the Three Sisters is located in the extreme northwest of the Rätikon. The three peaks form a ridge that runs from north to south. To the west, the Three Sisters fall into the Alpine Rhine Valley, in the east to the Saminatal. The ridge to the south leads to the border summit Garsellakopf, and further south to Kuhgrat, which is entirely in Liechtenstein

The area is well developed for hikers through an extensive network of paths. The main peak can also be reached by rock climbing routes ranging from UIAA difficulty levels II to V. The north wall of the middle sister has routes with a UIAA level VI difficulty.

== Conservation ==
The Vorarlberg region of the Three Sisters was granted a protected landscape status in 1976.

<text>Martin “Tank” Edward Dempsey (born 14 March 1952), is an American retired military officer who served as the 18th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from October 2011 to September 2015. He previously served as the 37th chief of Staff of the Army from April to September 2011. Before that, he served as Commanding General, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, from December 2008 to April 2011, as Acting Commander, U.S. Central Command, from March to October 2008, as Deputy Commander, U.S. Central Command, from August 2007 to March 2008, and as Commanding General, Multi-National Security Transition Command – Iraq (MNSTC-I), from August 2005 to August 2007. Dempsey assumed his assignment as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 2011, and stepped down from the Chairmanship in September 2015. He has served as a professor at Duke University and as chairman of USA Basketball.

==Early life==
Dempsey was born on 14 March 1952, in Jersey City, New Jersey, and grew up in nearby Bayonne. He attended John S. Burke Catholic High School in Goshen, New York. Dempsey is Irish American. Following high school, Dempsey attended the United States Military Academy at West Point and graduated with the Class of 1974. Dempsey&#x27;s four grandparents were born in the counties of Sligo, Donegal, Mayo and Roscommon in Ireland. He learned a small amount of the Irish language while spending his summers in Ireland as a child.

==Career==
Dempsey received a commission as an Armor officer upon graduation from the United States Military Academy in 1974. As a company-grade officer, he served in 1st Squadron, 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment as the officer in charge for personnel. He went on to be the executive officer of the 3rd Brigade 3rd Armored Division during Operation Desert Shield/Storm. As a captain, Dempsey was the commanding officer of Alpha Troop, 1/10 Armored Cavalry at Ft. Carson, CO. As a lieutenant colonel he commanded the 4th Battalion of the 67th Armored Regiment &quot;Bandits&quot; from 1992 to 1995 in the 1st Armored Division in Friedberg, Hesse, Germany.

In 1996 he took command of the 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment. Following that assignment as the Army&#x27;s “senior scout,” he served as an Assistant Deputy Director for Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5) on the Joint Staff, and as Special Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Henry H. Shelton, USA. During this period of his career, he attended both the Army Command and General Staff College and the National War College, earning master&#x27;s degrees in military art and national strategic studies.

Promoted to brigadier general in August 2001, Dempsey first served in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia training and advising the Saudi Arabian National Guard.

In June 2003, then Major General Dempsey assumed command of the 1st Armored Division. He succeeded Ricardo S. Sanchez who was promoted to lieutenant general, as commander of V Corps. Dempsey&#x27;s command of the 1st Armored Division lasted until July 2005 and included 13 months in Iraq, from June 2003 to July 2004. While in Iraq, 1st Armored Division, in addition to its own brigades, had operational command over the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment and a brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division; the command, called &quot;Task Force Iron&quot; in recognition of the Division&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;, was the largest division-level command in the history of the United States Army.

It was during this time that the U.S. intervention in Iraq changed dramatically as Fallujah fell to Sunni extremists and supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr built their strength and rose against American forces. Then Major General Dempsey and his command assumed responsibility for the area of operations in Baghdad as the insurgency incubated, grew, and exploded. General Dempsey has been described by Thomas Ricks in his book &quot;&quot;: &quot;In the capital itself, the 1st Armored Division, after Sanchez assumed control of V Corps, was led by Maj. Gen. Martin Dempsey, was generally seen as handling a difficult (and inherited) job well, under the global spotlight of Baghdad.&quot;

On 27 March 2007, Lieutenant General Dempsey was transferred from commander of Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq, and reassigned as deputy commander of U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida.

On 5 February 2008, Dempsey was nominated to head the U.S. Army, Europe/Seventh Army, and was nominated for promotion to four-star general upon Senate approval.

On 11 March 2008, Dempsey&#x27;s commander, Admiral William J. Fallon, resigned from his post as commander of Central Command. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates accepted this as effective on March 31. Dempsey temporarily took over as acting commander.

On 13 March 2008, Dempsey was confirmed by the United States Senate as Commander, U.S. Army, Europe/Seventh Army. However, due, to Admiral Fallon&#x27;s unexpected retirement, Dempsey never took command of U.S. Army, Europe/Seventh Army.

On 11 July 2008, Dempsey was nominated to take command of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command while Lieutenant General Carter F. Ham replaced his nomination to command the U.S. Army, Europe/Seventh Army.

On 8 December 2008, Dempsey assumed command of United States Army Training and Doctrine Command.

On 6 January 2011, Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced that he would recommend that the President nominate General Dempsey to succeed General George Casey as the Army Chief of Staff. On 8 February 2011, Gates announced that President Barack Obama nominated Dempsey to be the 37th Chief of Staff of the United States Army. On 3 March 2011, Dempsey testified before the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, and on 15 March 2011, the committee affirmatively reported Dempsey&#x27;s nomination. On 16 March 2011, the Senate confirmed Dempsey&#x27;s nomination by unanimous consent. On 11 April 2011, Dempsey was sworn in as Chief of Staff of the United States Army at a ceremony at Fort Myer.

With Admiral Michael Mullen set to retire as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September 2011, U.S. President Obama needed to select his replacement. The vice-chairman, Marine General James Cartwright, who was initially believed to be the front runner for the job, had fallen out of favor among senior officials in the Defense Department. Obama administration officials revealed on 26 May 2011, that Obama would nominate Dempsey to the post of chairman. In August 2011, General Dempsey was confirmed by unanimous consent to succeed Admiral Mike Mullen as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He was sworn in as 18th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 1 October 2011. On 26 June 2013, Obama re-nominated General Dempsey to serve a second two-year term as chairman. Dempsey stepped down on 25 September 2015, and was replaced by General Joseph Dunford, USMC.

Dempsey was appointed as the chairman of USA Basketball in 2016. After eight years in the position, he was re-elected as chair in October 2024 through to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

On 18 October 2020, Dempsey was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame, in the Public Service category.

== Personal life ==
Dempsey is married to his high school sweetheart, Deanie. They have three children: Chris, Megan, and Caitlin. Each has served in the United States Army and is married with three children. Chris remains on active duty as a cavalry colonel. Martin and Deanie have nine grandchildren.

<text>Laurence Henry Hicks OBE (1912 – 21 April 1997) was an English-born military bandmaster and composer. He migrated to Australia in 1952 after having served in World War II with both the British Army&#x27;s Black Watch and the Fourth Canadian Armoured Division&#x27;s military bands. From April 1952 onward, Hicks was the first Director of Music for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). On 1 January 1963, he was appointed to The Order of the British Empire – Officer (Military) with the citation, &quot;For service as Director of Music with the RAAF&quot;. In preparation for the 1968 independence of Nauru, Hicks composed music for the national anthem &quot;Nauru Bwiema&quot;, with lyrics by Nauruan writer Margaret Hendrie. He was Squadron Leader of the Central Band which performed on 31 January at the independence ceremony in Nauru.

==Biography==
Laurence Hicks was born in 1912 in London to a father who was a clarinet player in the British Army. At the age of 14 years, he was a band boy for the Cameronian Scottish Rifles. The following year he attended Royal Military School of Music at Kneller Hall learning the clarinet and cello. He subsequently joined the Cameronian Scottish Rifles as a clarinetist and toured Egypt for two years and then India. He returned to study at Kneller Hall undertaking a bandmaster course and graduated in 1938. Hicks was appointed to the Black Watch and served with them at the outset of World War II. From 1940 to 1941 he taught woodwind instruments at Kneller Hall. The following year, he trained a military band for the Canadian Army, and in 1944 took part in the allied invasion of Europe with the Fourth Canadian Armoured Division. In mid-June 1944, the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps Band performed at Normandy, Hicks recalled &quot;we were mobbed by the troops particularly after we played the &#x27;Colonel Bogey March&#x27; which everyone enjoyed&quot;. After the war he rejoined the Black Watch band and performed in India, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Britain.

In January 1951, his band recorded &quot;Black Watch Military Band (Royal Highland Regiment) Conducted by Bandmaster Laurence H. Hicks&quot;, which included a composition by Hicks, &quot;Jubilee March&quot;. The following month they toured Australia and New Zealand. In April 1952 he was appointed the inaugural Director of Music for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and re-established the Central Band. He recruited new members and designed the band&#x27;s uniform. By March 1956 the Central Band were practising every national anthem for the forthcoming Summer Olympics in Melbourne. On 1 January 1963, Hicks was awarded The Order of the British Empire – Officer (Military), &quot;in recognition of his loyal and valuable service&quot;, with the citation &quot;For service as Director of Music with the RAAF&quot;.

In preparation for the 1968 independence of Nauru, Hicks composed music for the national anthem, &quot;Nauru Bwiema&quot;, with lyrics by Nauran writer, Margaret Hendrie. He was Squadron Leader of the RAAF Central Band which performed on 31 January at the independence ceremony in Nauru.

In about 1938, Hicks married and by 1956 the couple had three children. Hicks died in 1997 aged 84-85, and in 1998, the Nauru Philatelic Bureau issued stamps to commemorate the 30th year of independence, including two acknowledging Hicks’ role.

<text>Scripophily is the study and collection of stock and bond certificates. A specialized field of numismatics, scripophily has developed as an area of collecting because of the inherent beauty of certain historical certificates, and because of interest in the historical context of many of the documents. In addition, some stock certificates serve as excellent examples of engraving. Occasionally, an old stock certificate is found that still has value, representing actual shares in the original or a successor company.

==History==

Scripophily, the collecting of old stocks and bonds, gained recognition as a hobby around 1970. The word &quot;scripophily&quot; was coined by combining words from English and Greek. The word &quot;scrip&quot; represents an ownership right and the word &quot;philos&quot; means &quot;to love&quot;.

Today, there are thousands of collectors worldwide in search of scarce, rare, and popular stock and bond certificates. Whether they are private investors or business people, many collectors enjoy scripophily as a hobby, while others consider it a good form of investment.

Many collectors appreciate the historical significance of old certificates. Others prefer the beauty of older stock and bond certificates that were printed in various colors with fancy artwork and ornate engravings. In recent times, certificates issued by dot-com companies and companies involved in scandals have become particularly popular amongst scripophilists.

A recent addition to the hobby of scripophily is collecting shares issued in one&#x27;s name. Common companies that issue personalized stock certificates include The Walt Disney Company, Harley-Davidson, McDonald&#x27;s, Starbucks, Google, Ford Motor Company, The Coca-Cola Company, and Berkshire Hathaway.

Many autograph collectors engage in scripophily, looking for certificates signed by historic or well-known figures. Certificates of this type include stock certificates issued by Standard Oil Company and signed by John D. Rockefeller, Franklin Fire Insurance Company certificates signed by Henry Charles Carey, Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, Atari Corporation, Eastern Air Lines certificates signed by Eddie Rickenbacker when he served as the company&#x27;s president, Tucker Corporation, and many others.

==As a hobby==

A large part of scripophily is the study of financial history. Over the years there have been millions of companies that needed to raise money. In order to do so, the founders of these companies issued securities. Generally speaking, they either issued equity securities in the form of stock or debt securities in the form of bonds. However, there are many varieties of equity and debt instruments, including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and bonds of various types.

Each certificate is a piece of history about a company and its business. Some companies became major successes, while others were acquired and merged with other companies. Some companies and industries were successful until they were replaced by new technologies. Some companies have been the center of scandal or fraud. The color, paper, signatures, dates, stamps, cancellations, borders, pictures, vignettes, industry, stockbroker, name of company, transfer agent, printer, and holder name are all of interest to scripophilists.

Many companies either were never successful or went bankrupt, so that their certificates became worthless pieces of paper until the hobby of scripophily began. The mining boom in the 1850s, railroad construction in the 1830s, the oil boom in the 1870s, telegraphy in the 1850s, the automobile industry beginning around 1900, aviation beginning around 1910, electric power and banks in the 1930s, the airline wars and mergers in the 1970s, cellular telephones beginning in the 1980s, long-distance telephone service in the 1980s and 1990s, and most recently the dot-com era and Enron all resulted in historically significant certificates being generated and issued.

Today, stocks and bonds are typically issued electronically, meaning fewer paper certificates are issued as a percentage of actual stock issued. The Internet has played a role in raising awareness of the hobby. A number of websites now exist that sell old stocks and bonds.

==Guidelines==

There are many factors that determine value of a certificate. These include condition, age, historical significance, signatures, rarity, demand for the item, aesthetics, the type of company, the original face value, bankers associated with the issuance, transfer stamps, cancellation markings, whether the certificate was issued or unissued, printers, and the type of engraving process.

<doc id="381359" wikidata="Q2024794" url="?curid=381359" title="Battlefield medicine">
<text>Battlefield medicine, also called field surgery and later combat casualty care, is the treatment of wounded combatants and non-combatants in or near an area of combat. Civilian medicine has been greatly advanced by procedures that were first developed to treat the wounds inflicted during combat. With the advent of advanced procedures and medical technology, even polytrauma can be survivable in modern wars. Battlefield medicine is a category of military medicine.

==History==

===Antiquity===

* During Alexander the Great&#x27;s military campaigns in the 4th century BC, tourniquets were used to stanch the bleeding of wounded soldiers. Romans used them to control bleeding, especially during amputations. These tourniquets were narrow straps made of bronze, using leather only for comfort.
* According to bamboo slips from the Han dynasty, external injury from combat and infighting comprised the plurality of injuries and illnesses from soldiers on the front line. These injuries were followed in numbers by exogenous febrile diseases and diseases of abdominal pain, namely disorders of the digestive and respiratory systems. Medical treatment was poor and comprised such treatments as acupuncture, applications of plaster, and drugs, the latter being the most common.
* During the 1st century BC, the Roman army used spider webs and honey-soaked bandages as field dressings. Wounds were packed with webs before being wrapped in honey-soaked bandages; the webs served as a natural fungicide while the honey staved off bacterial infection. Amulets were provided to wounded combatants and field doctors distributed those associated with particular gods based whichever god was most appropriate to the circumstances. This appears to have been effective for the combatant&#x27;s mental health.

===Middle Ages===
* During the Middle Ages, most soldiers were killed on the battlefield by a fatal loss of blood.
* An early stretcher, likely made of wicker over a frame, appears in a manuscript from . Simple stretchers were common with militaries right through the middle of the 20th century.
* After being wounded during the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403, Prince Henry had an arrow removed from his face by John Bradmore using a specially-designed surgical instrument.
* Ambulances were first used by Spanish soldiers during the Siege of Málaga in 1487, a part of the campaigns to seize control of southern Spain. Authorized by Isabella I of Castile, the ambulances were largely ineffective, though they were perceived as critical to Spanish morale.

===Early modern period===

* French military surgeon Ambroise Paré (1510–1590) pioneered modern battlefield wound treatment. His two main contributions to battlefield medicine are the use of dressing to treat wounds and the use of ligature to stop bleeding during amputation.
* The practice of triage was pioneered by Dominique Jean Larrey, Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s surgeon-in-chief of the Imperial Guard during the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815). He also pioneered the use of ambulances in the midst of combat, called (&#x27;flying ambulances&#x27;). Prior to this, military ambulances had waited for combat to cease before collecting the wounded by which time many casualties had succumbed to their injuries.
* Russian surgeon Nikolay Pirogov was one of the first surgeons to use ether as an anaesthetic in 1847, as well as the very first surgeon to use anaesthesia in a field operation during the Crimean War.
* During the American Civil War, Jonathan Letterman modernized medical organization on the battlefield for the Union. Following his appointment as the Medical Director of the Army of the Potomac, Letterman founded an ambulance corps staffed with permanent and trained attendants which was later compounded in efficacy by the organization of hospital echelons and tent hospitals in the war&#x27;s eastern theater. His contributions led to his being recognized as the &quot;father of battlefield medicine&quot;. 
* The Relief Society for Wounded Soldiers, forerunner of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was founded in 1863 in Geneva. The ICRC advocated for the establishment of national aid societies for battlefield medical relief, and stood behind the First Geneva Convention of 1864 which provided neutrality for medics, ambulances, and hospitals. 
* In the late 19th century, the influence of notable medical practitioners like Friedrich von Esmarch and members of the Venerable Order of Saint John pushing for every adult man and woman to be taught the basics of first aid eventually led to institutionalized first-aid courses amongst the military and standard first-aid kits for every soldier.

===20th and 21st centuries===

* Advances in surgery – especially amputation – during the Napoleonic Wars and First World War during the Battle of the Somme.
* Medical advances also provided kinder methods for treatment of battlefield injuries, such as antiseptic ointments, which replaced boiling oil for cauterizing amputations.
* During the Spanish Civil War there were two major advances. The first one was the invention of a practical method for transporting blood. Developed in Barcelona by Duran i Jordà, the technique mixed the blood of the donors with the same blood type and then, using Grifols glass tubes and a refrigerator truck, transported the blood to the front line. A few weeks later Norman Bethune developed a similar service. The second advance was the invention of the mobile operating room by the Catalan Moisès Broggi, who worked for the International Brigades.
* The establishment of fully equipped and mobile field hospitals such as the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) was first practiced by the United States in World War II. It was succeeded in 2006 by the Combat Support Hospital.
* The use of helicopters as ambulances, or aeromedical evacuation, was first practiced in Burma in 1944. The first MEDEVAC under fire was done in Manila in 1945 where over seventy troops were extracted in five helicopters, one and two casualties at a time.
* The extension of emergency medicine to pre-hospital settings through the use of emergency medical technicians.
* The use of remote physiological monitoring devices on soldiers to show vital signs and biomechanical data to the medic and MEDEVAC crew before and during trauma. This allows medicine and treatment to be administered as soon as possible in the field and during extraction. Similar telemetry units are used in crewed spaceflight, where a flight surgeon at the Command Center can monitor vital signs. This can help to see issues before larger problems occur, such as elevated carbon dioxide levels, or a rise in body temperature indicating a possible infection.

== History of Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) ==

In 1989, the Commander of the Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM) established a research program to conduct studies on medical and physiologic issues. The research concluded that extremity hemorrhage was a leading cause of preventable death in the battlefield. At that time, proper care and treatment was not provided immediately which often resulted in death. This insight prompted a systematic reevaluation of all aspects of battlefield trauma care that was conducted from 1993 to 1996 as a joint effort by special operations medical personnel and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. Through this 3-year research, the first version of the TCCC guidelines were created to train soldiers to provide effective intervention on the battlefield. The TCCC aims to combine good medicine with good small-unit tactics. One very important aspect that the TCCC outlined was the use of tourniquets, initially there was a belief that the use of tourniquets led to the preventable loss of an extremity due to ischemia but after careful literature search the committee arrived at the conclusion that there was not enough information out there to confirm this claim. The TCCC therefore outline the appropriate usage of tourniquets to provide effective first aid on the battlefield.

After the TCCC article was published in 1996, the program undertook 4 parallel efforts during the next 5-year period. These efforts are as follows: 

# Presenting TCCC concepts to senior Department of Defense (DoD) line and medical leaders and advocating for their use.
# Identifying and developing responses to representative types of TCCC casualty scenarios.
# Initiating TCCC&#x27;s first strategic partnership with civilian trauma organizations—the Prehospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS) Committee, the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (NAEMT), and the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT).
# Expanding TCCC training beyond medical personnel to include SEAL and 75th Ranger Regiment combat leaders and nonmedical unit members.

==Modern applications==

Over the past decade combat medicine has improved drastically. Everything has been given a complete overhaul from the training to the gear. In 2011, all enlisted military medical training for the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Army were located under one command, the Medical Education and Training Campus (METC). After attending a basic medical course there (which is similar to a civilian EMT course), the students go on to advanced training in Tactical Combat Casualty Care.

=== Tactical combat casualty care (TCCC) ===

Tactical combat casualty care is becoming the standard of care for the tactical management of combat casualties within the Department of Defense and is the sole standard of care endorsed by both the American College of Surgeons and the National Association of EMT&#x27;s for casualty management in tactical environments.

Tactical combat casualty care is built around three definitive phases of casualty care:
# Care Under Fire: Care rendered at the scene of the injury while both the medic and the casualty are under hostile fire. Available medical equipment is limited to that carried by each operator and the medic. This stage focuses on a quick assessment, and placing a tourniquet on any major bleed.
# Tactical Field Care: Rendered once the casualty is no longer under hostile fire. Medical equipment is still limited to that carried into the field by mission personnel. Time prior to evacuation may range from a few minutes to many hours. Care here may include advanced airway treatment, IV therapy, etc. The treatment rendered varies depending on the skill level of the provider as well as the supplies available. This is when a corpsman/medic will make a triage and evacuation decision.
# Tactical Evacuation Care (TACEVAC): Rendered while the casualty is evacuated to a higher echelon of care. Any additional personnel and medical equipment pre-staged in these assets will be available during this phase.

Since &quot;90% of combat deaths occur on the battlefield before the casualty ever reaches a medical treatment facility&quot; (Col. Ron Bellamy) TCCC focuses training on major hemorrhaging and airway complications such as a tension-pneumothorax. This has driven the casualty fatality rate down to less than 9%.

=== Interventions used ===
Listed below are interventions that a TCCC provider may be expected to perform depending on the phase of TCCC they are at and their level of training. This list is not comprehensive and may be subject to change with future revisions in TCCC guidelines.

Hemorrhage control interventions include the use of extremity tourniquets, junctional tourniquets, trauma dressings, wound packing with compressed gauze and hemostatic dressings, and direct pressure. Newer devices approved for use by the CoTCCC for hemorrhage control include the iTClamp and XStat. Pharmacological options also include tranexamic acid, and hemostatic agents such as zeolite and chitosan.

In managing a casualty&#x27;s airway, a TCCC provider may position the casualty in the recovery position or utilize airway adjuncts such as nasopharyngeal airways, oropharyngeal airways, and supraglottic airways. They may also utilize the jaw thrust and head-tilt/ chin-lift maneuver to open a casualty&#x27;s airway. Advanced TCCC providers may also perform endotracheal intubation and cricothyroidotomy.

Respiratory management largely revolves around the use of chest seals, vented and unvented, and needle decompressions to manage tension pneumothoraxes.

In circulation management a TCCC provider may obtain intravenous/ intraosseous access for the administration of fluids such as normal saline, lactated Ringer&#x27;s solution, whole blood, and colloids and plasma substitutes for fluid resuscitation. This also provides a route for the administration of other drugs in accordance with the provider&#x27;s scope of practice.

Head injuries would indicate for cervical spine immobilization to the best of the provider&#x27;s abilities if deemed appropriate in a given setting, or the use of devices such as a cervical collar.

As trauma-induced hypothermia is a leading cause of battlefield deaths, a provider may also perform hypothermia prevention can be accomplished through the use of a Hypothermia Prevention and Management Kit or emergency blanket, the placement of a casualty on an insulated surface, and the removal of wet clothing from a casualty&#x27;s body.

=== Care under fire ===
Care under fire is care provided at the point of injury immediately upon wounding while the casualty and care provider remain under effective hostile fire. The casualty should be encouraged to provide self-aid and remain engaged in the firefight if possible. If unable to do so, the casualty should be encouraged to move behind cover or &quot;play dead&quot;. Due to the high risk of injury to the care-provider and limited resources at this phase, care provided to the casualty should be limited to controlling life-threatening hemorrhage with tourniquets and preventing airway obstruction by placing casualty in the recovery position. The primary focus during care under fire should be winning the firefight to prevent further casualties and further wounding of existing casualties.

=== Tactical field care ===
Tactical field care phase begins when the casualty and care-provider are no longer under imminent threat of injury by hostile actions. Though the level of danger is lessened, care-providers should exercise caution and maintain good situational awareness as the tactical situation may be fluid and subject to change. The tactical field care phase enables the provision of more comprehensive care according to care providers&#x27; levels of training, tactical considerations, and available resources. Major tasks that are to be completed in the tactical field care phase include the rapid trauma survey, the triage of all casualties, and the transport decision.

=== Tactical evacuation care ===
Tactical evacuation care refers to care provided when a casualty is being evacuated and en-route to higher levels of medical care. Care providers at this phase are at even less risk of imminent harm as result of hostile actions. Due to improved access to resources and the tactical situation, more advanced interventions can be provided to casualties such as endotracheal intubation. Patient re-assessments and the addressing of issues that were not or were inadequately addressed previously are also major components of this phase.

In tactical evacuation (TACEVAC), casualties are moved from a hostile environment to a safer and more secure location to receive advanced medical care. Tactical evacuation techniques use a combination of air, ground and water units to conduct the mission depending on the location of the incident and medical centres. Ground vehicle evacuations are more prevalent in urban locations that are in close proximity to medical facilities. Requests for evacuation of casualties and pertinent information are typically communicated through 9-Line MEDEVAC and MIST reports.

Tactical evaluation is an umbrella term that encompasses both medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) and casualty evacuation (CASEVAC). Medical evacuation platforms are typically not engaged in combat except in self-defence and defence of patients. MEDEVAC takes place using special dedicated medical assets marked with a red cross. Casualty evacuation is through non-medical platforms and may include a Quick-Reaction force aided by air support.

For aircraft involved TACEVAC situations there are many considerations that need to be accounted for. Firstly, the flying rules vary widely depending on the aircraft and units in play. The list of determinants to create the TACEVAC strategy include the distances and altitudes involved, time of day, passenger capacity, hostile threat, availability of medical equipment/personnel, and icing conditions. As mentioned TACEVAC is more advanced than TCCC, it also includes training to/for: 

* improve breathing 
* provide supplemental oxygen 
* administer Tranexamic acid (TXA) 
* deal with traumatic brain injuries 
* fluid resuscitation
* blood product administration
* blood transfusion
* preventing and treating hypothermia

=== Canadian armed forces ===

There are three levels of tactical combat casualty care providers in the Canadian Armed Forces.

==== Combat first aid ====
Every soldier receives a two-day combat first aid training course. The course focuses on treating hemorrhages, using tourniquets and applying dressings, and basic training for casualty management.

==== Tactical combat casualty care ====
A select number of soldiers are chosen to participate in an intense 2-week tactical combat casualty care course where soldiers are provided with additional training. Overall, they are trained to work as medic extenders since they work under the direction of medics.

==== Tactical medicine ====
The tactical medicine (TACMED) course is offered exclusively to medics. The tactical medicine program provides training for advanced tactical combat casualty care and is the highest level of care provided by the Canadian Armed Forces in a battlefield setting. Medics are trained to treat and manage patients using the MARCHE protocol. The MARCHE protocol prioritizes potential preventable causes of death in warfare as follows:

# Massive hemorrhage control
# Airway management
# Respiratory management
# Circulation
## Bleeding control
## Intravenous (IV)/ intraosseous (IO) access
## Fluid resuscitation
## Tourniquet reassessment
# Hypothermia prevention
# Head injuries
# Eye injuries
# Everything else
## Monitor patient
## Pain management
## Head-to-toe assessment
## Address all wounds found
## Antibiotics
## Tactical evacuation preparation
## Documentation of care and findings

=== United States ===

==== Care under fire ====
Care under fire happens at the point of injury. According to tactical combat casualty care guidelines, the most effective way to reduce further morbidity and mortality is to return fire at enemy combatants by all personnel. The priority is to continue the combat mission, gain fire superiority, and then treat casualties. The only medical treatment rendered in care under fire is the application of direct pressure on massive bleeding. Tactical combat casualty care recommends a tourniquet as the single most important treatment at the point of injury. It is recommended during care under fire to quickly place tourniquets over clothing, high, and tight; the tourniquet should be reassessed when out of danger in the tactical field care phase.

==== Tactical field care ====
Tactical field care is considered to be the backbone of Tactical Combat Casualty Care and consists of care rendered by first responders or prehospital medical personnel while still in the tactical environment. The acronyms MARCH and PAWS help personnel remember crucial treatment steps while under duress.

===== MARCH =====
The MARCH acronym is used by personnel to remember the proper order of treatment for casualties.

Massive hemorrhage. The most potentially survivable cause of death is hemorrhage from extremity bleeds, however more than 90% of 4596 combat mortalities post September 11, 2001 died of hemorrhage associated injuries. It is recommended to apply a Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care (CoTCCC) approved tourniquet for any life-threatening extremity hemorrhages. Tourniquets during tactical field care should be placed under clothing 2 to 3 inches above the wound, with application time written on the tourniquet.

Airway. Non-patent or closed airway is another survivable cause of death. Airway injuries typically occur due to inhalation burns or maxillofacial trauma. If a person is conscious and speaking they have a patent open airway, while nasopharyngeal airway could benefit those who are unconscious and breathing. However, unconscious casualties who are not breathing could require surgical cricothyroidotomy, as endotracheal intubation is highly difficult in tactical settings.

Respirations. Tension pneumothorax (PTX) develops when air trapped in the chest cavity displaces functional lung tissue and puts pressure on the heart causing cardiac arrest. Thus, open chest wounds must be sealed using a vented chest seal. Tension pneumothorax should be decompressed using a needle chest decompression (NCD) with a 14 gauge, 3.25 inch needle with a catheter. Ventilation and/or oxygenation should be supported as required.

Circulation. It is more important to stem the flow of bleeding than to infuse fluids, and only casualties in shock or those who need intravenous (IV) medications should have IV access. Signs of shock include unconsciousness or altered mental status, and/or abnormal radial pulse. IV should be applied using an 18 gauge catheter and saline lock in tactical field care, secured by transparent would-dressing film. Tranexamic acid (TXA) should be given as soon as possible to casualties in or at risk of hemorrhagic shock. An intraosseous (IO) device could also be used for administering fluids if IV access is not feasible.

Head injury/hypothermia. Secondary brain injury is worsened by hypotension (systolic blood pressure under 90 mmHg), hypoxia (peripheral capillary oxygen saturation under 90%), and hypothermia (whole body temperature below 95 Fahrenheit or 35 Celsius). Medical personnel can use the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation (MACE), while non-medical personnel can use the alert, verbal, pain, unresponsive (AVPU) scale to identify traumatic brain injury. The &quot;lethal triad&quot; is a combination of hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy in trauma patients. Since hypothermia can occur regardless of ambient temperature due to blood loss, the Hypothermia Prevention and Management Kit (HPMK) is recommended for all casualties.

===== PAWS =====
The PAWS acronym is used by personnel to remember additional casualty care items that should be addressed.

Pain. Proper management of pain reduces stress on a casualty&#x27;s mind and body, and have reduced incidents of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Pain management is shown to reduce harmful patient movement, improves compliance and cooperation, and allows for easier transport as well as improved health outcomes.

Antibiotics. All battlefield wounds are considered contaminated, and thus any penetrating injury should receive antibiotics at the point of injury as well as in tactical field care. The recommended parenteral antibiotics are 1g ertapenem or 2g cefotetan, which can treat multi drug-resistant bacteria. if the casualty can tolerate oral fluids, 400mg moxifloxacin can be administered orally instead of ertapenem or cefotetan.

Wounds. Assessing the casualty for additional wounds improves morbidity and mortality. First responders must address burns, open fractures, facial trauma, amputation dressings, and security of tourniquets. Prior to movement, reassessment of wounds and interventions is very important. Casualties with penetrating trauma to the chest or abdomen should receive priority evacuation due to the possibility of internal hemorrhage.

Splinting. Explosions (such as from improvised explosive device or land mines) that cause lower extremity traumatic amputation cause forces to move upward through the body, which may cause further bone disruption, hollow organ collapse, or internal bleeding. Thus, first responders should use the Combat Ready Clamp (CRoC), the Junctional Emergency Treatment Tool (JETT), or the SAM Junctional Tourniquet to control junctional hemorrhage and stabilize the pelvis. In cases of penetrative eye trauma, responders should first perform a rapid field test of visual acuity, then tape a rigid shield over the eye to prevent further damage, and also give 400mg oral moxifloxacin as soon as possible. Pressure must never by applied to an eye suspected of penetrative injury.

== Evaluating effectiveness ==
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of Tactical Combat Casualty Care, a study was conducted which analyzed US military casualties who died from an injury that occurred while they were deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq from October 2001 to June 2011. Of the 4,596 casualties, 87% died in the pre-medical treatment facility, prior to receiving surgical care. Of the casualties in the pre-medical treatment facility, 75.7% of the prehospital deaths were non-survivable, while 24.3% of deaths were potentially survivable. Instantaneous non-survivable mortalities included physical dismemberment, catastrophic brain injury, and destructive cardiovascular injury. Non-instantaneous non-survivable mortalities included severe traumatic brain injury, thoracic vascular injury, high spinal cord injury, and destructive abdominal pelvic injury. These injuries are very difficult to treat given currently fielded medical therapies such as Tactical Combat Casualty Care.

In terms of potentially survivable mortalities, 8.0% of mortalities were associated with airway obstruction. Majority of mortalities (90.9%) which were classified as potentially survivable mortalities were attributed to hemorrhage, with 67.3% of the hemorrhage being truncal, 19.2% junctional, and 13.5% extremity. During the study period, there were no effective protocols put in place to control junctional or truncal sources of hemorrhage in the battlefield, which suggests a gap in medical treatment capability.

This study shows the majority of battlefield casualties which occur prior to receiving surgical care are non-survivable. However, of the casualties which are survivable, the majority of deaths can be attributed to hemorrhages. Developing protocol which can control and temporize hemorrhage in the battlefield would improve the effectiveness of Tactical Combat Casualty Care, and decreases the number of casualties in the battlefield.

Another study analyzed the effectiveness of tourniquets for hemorrhage control, which are used in Tactical Combat Casualty Care. A four-year retrospective analysis showed that out of 91 soldiers who were treated with tourniquets, 78% of tourniquets were applied effectively. The success rate for tourniquets applied to upper limbs was 94% while the success rate for tourniquets applied to lower limbs was 71%. The difference between the success rates can be attributed to the tourniquets themselves, as in another study, tourniquets applied on healthy volunteers resulted in a much lower success rate for lower limbs in comparison to upper limbs. Therefore, the tourniquets themselves can be redesigned to increase its effectiveness and improve Tactical Combat Casualty Care.

A prospective study of all trauma patients treated at the Canadian-led Role 3 multinational medical unit (Role 3 MMU) established at Kandahar Airfield Base between February 7, 2006, to May 20, 2006, was conducted to examine how Tactical Combat Casualty Care interventions are delivered. The study concluded that tourniquets are effective, but must be used appropriately. The distinction between venous and arterial tourniquets must be reinforced in Tactical Combat Casualty Care training. Tactical Combat Casualty Care courses must also train soldiers to remove tourniquets for the purposes of reassessing trauma after the patient and caregiver is no longer under enemy fire. This is because the risks of iatrogenic ischemic injury of prolonged use of tourniquets outweigh the risks of increased blood loss.

The study also identified technical errors in performing needle decompressions. All needle decompressions were performed at least medial to the mid-clavicular line and well within the cardiac box. This may result in injury to the heart and surrounding vasculature. Tactical Combat Casualty Care training must reinforce using landmarks when performing needle decompressions. This is especially useful since soldiers may have to perform this procedure in poor lighting conditions.

<text>Clement Clarke Moore (July 15, 1779 – July 10, 1863) was an American writer, scholar and real estate developer. He is best known as author of the Christmas poem &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot;, which first named each of Santa Claus&#x27;s reindeer.

Moore was Professor of Oriental and Greek Literature, as well as Divinity and Biblical Learning, at the General Theological Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal Church, in New York City. The seminary was developed on land donated by Moore and it continues on this site at Ninth Avenue between 20th and 21st streets, in an area known as Chelsea Square. Moore gained considerable wealth by subdividing and developing other parts of his large inherited estate in what became known as the residential neighborhood of Chelsea. He also served for 44 years as a member of the board of trustees of Columbia College (later University), and was a board member of the New York Society Library and the New York Institution for the Blind.

&quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas,&quot; which later became widely known by its opening line, &quot;&#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas,&quot; was first published anonymously in 1823. Moore publicly claimed authorship in 1837, and this was not disputed during his lifetime, but a rival claimant emerged later and scholars now debate the identity of the author, calling on textual and handwriting analysis as well as other historical sources.

==Early life==
Moore was born on July 15, 1779, in New York City at &quot;Chelsea&quot;, his mother&#x27;s family estate. He was the son of Benjamin Moore (1748–1816) and Charity (née Clarke) Moore (1747–1838). At the time of Clement&#x27;s birth Benjamin Moore was assistant rector of Trinity Church in Manhattan. He later became rector of Trinity and bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, also serving as acting president of Kings College in 1775 and 1776 and president of the renamed Columbia College (now Columbia University) from 1801 to 1811.

Moore&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Major Thomas Clarke, an English officer who stayed in the colony after fighting in the French and Indian War. He owned the large Manhattan estate &quot;Chelsea&quot;, then in the country north of the developed areas of the city. As a girl, Moore&#x27;s mother Charity Clarke wrote letters to her English cousins. Preserved at Columbia University, these show her disdain for the policies of the British monarchy and her growing sense of patriotism in pre-Revolutionary days. Moore&#x27;s grandmother Sarah Fish was a descendant of Elizabeth Fones and Joris Woolsey, one of the earlier settlers of Manhattan. Moore&#x27;s parents inherited the Chelsea estate, and deeded it to him in 1813. He got great wealth by subdividing and developing it in the 19th century.

Moore received a Bachelor of Arts from Columbia College as valedictorian of the class of 1798, a Master of Arts in 1801, and an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) in 1829.

==Career==
One of Moore&#x27;s earliest known works was an anonymous pro-Federalist pamphlet published prior to the 1804 presidential election, attacking the religious and racial views of Thomas Jefferson (the incumbent president and Democratic-Republican candidate). His polemic, titled in full &quot;Observations upon Certain Passages in Mr. Jefferson&#x27;s Notes on Virginia, which Appear to Have a Tendency to Subvert Religion, and Establish a False Philosophy,&quot; depicted Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; (1785) as an &quot;instrument of infidelity&quot; that &quot;debases the negro to an order of creatures lower than those who have a fairer skin and thinner lips.&quot;

In 1820, Moore helped Trinity Church organize a new parish church, St. Luke in the Fields, on Hudson Street. He later gave 66 tracts of land – the apple orchard from his inherited Chelsea estate – to the Episcopal Diocese of New York to be the site of the General Theological Seminary.

Based likely on this donation, and on the publication of his &quot;Hebrew and English Lexicon&quot; in 1809, Moore was appointed as professor of Biblical learning at the Seminary. He held this post until 1850.

After the seminary was built, Moore began the residential development of his Chelsea estate in the 1820s with the help of James N. Wells, dividing it into lots along Ninth Avenue and selling them to well-heeled New Yorkers. Covenants in the deeds of sale created a planned neighborhood, specifying what could be built on the land as well as architectural details of the buildings. Stables, manufacturing and commercial uses were forbidden in the development.

Moore was appointed to the Columbia College board of trustees in 1813 and served until 1857. He was clerk of the board from 1815 to 1850. From 1840 to 1850, Moore also served as a board member of the New York Institution for the Blind at 34th Street and Ninth Avenue (now the New York Institute for Special Education). He published a collection of poems (1844).

===&quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot;===
This poem, &quot;arguably the best-known verses ever written by an American,&quot; was first published anonymously in the Troy, New York &quot;Sentinel&quot; on December 23, 1823. It had been given to the paper&#x27;s editor by Sarah Sackett of Troy, who probably got it from Harriet Butler of Troy, a family friend of the Moores.

Anonymous or pseudonymous publication of poetry was customary at the time, but as the poem&#x27;s popularity grew so did curiosity about its author. In response to a query in 1829, &quot;Sentinel&quot; editor Orville Holley wrote that &quot;We have been given to understand that the author ... belongs by birth and residence to the city of New York, and that he is a gentleman of &quot;more&quot; merit as a scholar and a writer than many of more noisy pretensions.&quot; (Italics his.)

In 1837 Moore was finally publicly identified as the author in journalist Charles Fenno Hoffman&#x27;s &quot;The New-York Book of Poetry&quot;, to which Moore had submitted several poems. In 1844, he included &quot;Visit&quot; in &quot;Poems&quot;, an anthology of his works. His children, for whom he had originally written the piece, encouraged this publication. In 1855, Mary C. Moore Ogden, one of the Moores&#x27; married daughters, painted &quot;illuminations&quot; to go with the first color edition of the poem.

===Authorship controversy===
Scholars have debated whether Moore was the author of this poem. Professor Donald Foster used textual content analysis and external evidence to argue that Moore could not have been the author. Foster proposed that Major Henry Livingston, Jr., a New Yorker with Dutch and Scottish roots, should be considered the chief candidate for authorship. This view was long espoused by the Livingston family. Livingston was distantly related to Moore&#x27;s wife.

In response to Foster&#x27;s claim, Stephen Nissenbaum, professor of history at the University of Massachusetts, wrote in 2001 that, based on his research, Moore was the author. In his article, &quot;There Arose Such a Clatter: Who Really Wrote &#x27;The Night before Christmas&#x27;? (And Why Does It Matter?)&quot;, Nissenbaum confirmed Moore&#x27;s authorship, &quot;I believe he did, and I think I have marshaled an array of good evidence to prove [it]&quot;.

Foster&#x27;s claim has also been countered by document dealer and historian Seth Kaller, who once owned one of Moore&#x27;s original manuscripts of the poem. Kaller has offered a point-by-point rebuttal of both Foster&#x27;s linguistic analysis and external findings, buttressed by the work of autograph expert James Lowe and Dr. Joe Nickell, author of &quot;Pen, Ink and Evidence&quot;.

There is no evidence that Livingston ever claimed authorship, nor has any record ever been found of any printing of the poem with Livingston&#x27;s name attached to it. As first published in &quot;The Sentinel,&quot; the names of Santa&#x27;s last two reindeer in the poem were Dunder and Blixem, and Foster argued the change to Donder and Blitzen in later versions was evidence of tampering by Moore with the &quot;perfectly correct Dutch&quot; of Livingston. But donder is the correct Dutch word for thunder, and the phrase was used by multiple English and American authors with a variety of different spellings in the late 1700s and early 1800s.

In 2016, the matter was discussed by MacDonald P. Jackson, an emeritus professor of English literature at the University of Auckland, a fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand and an expert in authorship attribution using statistical techniques. He evaluated every argument using modern computational stylistics, including one never used before – statistical analysis of phonemes – and found, in his opinion, that in every test that Livingston was the more likely author.

Subsequent analyses using forensic linguistics techniques developed by computer scientists have come to the opposite conclusion. In his 2023 book &quot;The Fight for &quot;The Night&quot;: Resolving the Authorship Dispute over &quot;The Night Before Christmas,&quot;&quot; retired litigator Tom A. Jerman reported using Duquesne University computer scientist Patrick Juola&#x27;s Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program to compare the poem to the works of Moore and Livingston, with 16 of 17 tests pointing to Moore as the likelier author. That year, computer scientist Shlomo Argamon, then of the Illinois Institute of Technology, also analyzed the poem alongside texts from Moore, Livingston and five other authors of the era and concluded that “Moore is much more likely to be the author than Livingston,” and “it’s more likely authored by either Moore or Livingston than any of the other guys.”

===Developing Chelsea===
Moore&#x27;s estate, named Chelsea, was on the west side of the island of Manhattan north of Greenwich Village. It was mostly open countryside before the 1820s. It had been purchased in 1750 by his maternal grandfather Maj. Thomas Clarke, a retired British veteran of the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War). Clarke named his house for the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London that served war veterans. Moore&#x27;s parents inherited the estate in 1802, and several years later they deeded it to him.

When the government of New York City decided on a street grid in Manhattan, based on the Commissioner&#x27;s Plan of 1811, the new Ninth Avenue was projected to go through the middle of the Chelsea estate. In 1818, Moore wrote and published a pamphlet calling on other &quot;Proprietors of Real Estate&quot; to oppose the manner in which the city was being developed. He thought it was a conspiracy designed to increase political patronage and appease the city&#x27;s working class, and argued that making landowners bear the costs of the streets laid through their property was &quot;a tyranny no monarch in Europe would dare to exercise.&quot; He also criticized the grid plan and the flattening of hills as ill-advised.

Despite his protests, Moore was already preparing to develop Chelsea, acquiring adjacent plots of land from relatives and neighbors until he owned everything from Eighth Avenue to the Hudson River between 19th and 24th Streets. Together with carpenter-builder James N. Wells he divided the neighborhood into lots and marketed them to well-heeled New Yorkers. He donated a large block of land to the Episcopal diocese for construction of a seminary, giving them an apple orchard consisting of 66 tracts. Construction began in 1827 for the General Theological Seminary. Based on his knowledge of Hebrew, Moore was appointed as its first professor of Oriental Languages, serving until 1850.

The seminary continues to operate on the same site, taking up most of the block between 20th and 21st streets and Ninth and Tenth avenues. Ten years later, Moore gave land at 20th Street and Ninth, east of the avenue, to the diocese for construction of St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church. The contemporary Manhattan neighborhood is known as Chelsea after his estate.

==Personal life==
In 1813, Moore married Catherine Elizabeth Taylor, daughter of William Taylor and Elizabeth (née Van Cortlandt) Taylor. William Taylor was a New Jersey lawyer who had served as chief justice of Jamaica. Elizabeth Van Cortlandt was a direct descendant of Stephanus Van Cortlandt, the first native-born mayor of New York City and first patroon of Van Cortlandt Manor, as well as the niece by marriage of Sir Edward Buller, 1st Baronet. Together, Catherine and Clement Moore were the parents of nine children:
* Margaret Elliot Moore (1815–1845), who married John Doughty Ogden (1804–1887), a grandson of U.S. Attorney Abraham Ogden and nephew of U.S. Representative David A. Ogden.
* Charity Elizabeth Moore (1816–1830), who died young.
* Benjamin Moore (1818–1886), who married Mary Elizabeth Sing (1820–1895), in 1842, and was the father of Clement Clarke Moore, grandfather of Barrington Moore Sr., and great grandfather of Barrington Moore Jr.
* Mary Clarke Moore (1819–1893), who married John Doughty Ogden, her older sister&#x27;s widower, in 1848.
* Clement Moore (1821–1889), who did not marry.
* Emily Moore (1822–1828), who also died young.
* William Taylor Moore (1823-1897), who married Lucretia Post in 1857 and, after her death in 1872, Katherine E. Robinson. He had no children.
* Catharine Van Cortlandt Moore (1825–1890), who did not marry.
* Maria Theresa (&quot;Terry&quot;) Barrington Moore (1826–1900), who did not marry.

After spending a month in their company in the resort town of Sharon Springs, New York, in 1848, the acerbic diarist George Templeton Strong described the unmarried Moore children as, &quot;the sons a compound of imbecility deep beyond all fathoming, with an appetite for chambermaids beyond all precedent—the two Miss M’s very nice indeed.&quot; In the 1850s, Moore began summering in Newport, Rhode Island, together with his daughters Terry and Mary, and Mary&#x27;s family. He died on July 10, 1863, at his summer residence on Catherine Street in Newport, five days before his 84th birthday. His funeral was held in Trinity Church, Newport, where he had owned a pew. His body was returned to New York for burial in the cemetery at St. Luke in the Fields. On November 29, 1899, his body was reinterred in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York.

===Legacy and honors===

* In 1911, the Church of the Intercession in Manhattan started a service on the Sunday before Christmas that included a reading of the poem followed by a procession to Moore&#x27;s tomb at Trinity Church Cemetery on the Sunday before Christmas. This continues until this day.
* Clement Clarke Moore Park, located at 10th Avenue and 22nd Street in Chelsea, is named after Moore.
* A playground opened in the park on November 22, 1968, and was named for Moore by local law the following year. In 1995 it was fully renovated, and new trees were added. Local residents gather annually there on the last Sunday of Advent for a reading of &quot;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot;.
* PS13 in Elmhurst, Queens, is named after Clement C. Moore.

<text>Cripplegate was a gate in the London Wall which once enclosed the City of London, England.

The Cripplegate gate lent its name to the Cripplegate ward of the City, which encompasses the area where the gate and the former city wall once stood. The ward is divided into two parts: Cripplegate Within and Cripplegate Without, a division that originated from the gate and wall. Each part has a designated beadle and a deputy (alderman). Following boundary changes in 1994 (City) and 2003 (ward), the majority of the ward now falls within Cripplegate Without, as the ward of Bassishaw has expanded significantly into the Cripplegate Within area.

Until World War II, the area approximating to &quot;Cripplegate Without&quot; was commonly known as simply &quot;Cripplegate&quot;. The area was almost entirely destroyed in the Blitz of World War II, causing the term to fall out of colloquial speech. Cripplegate Without is the site of the Barbican Estate and Barbican Centre, with a small part of these lying in neighbouring Aldersgate Without.

==The gate==
The origins of the gate&#x27;s name are unclear. One theory, bolstered by a mentioning of the gate in the fourth law code of Æthelred the Unready and a charter of William the Conqueror from 1068 under the name &quot;Crepelgate&quot;, is that it takes its name from the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;crepel&quot;, meaning a covered or underground passageway.

Another unsubstantiated theory suggests it is named after the cripples who used to beg there. The name of the nearby medieval church of St Giles-without-Cripplegate lends credence to this suggestion as Saint Giles is the patron saint of cripples and lepers.

===History of the gate===
It was initially the northern gate to the Roman city walls, built around AD 120 or 150, eighty years before the rest of the wall was completed. It appeared to have been used as part of the Roman city walls until at least the 10th-11th centuries. Cripplegate was rebuilt during the 1490s and was unhinged and fortified with a portcullis after Charles II became king in 1660. It was eventually demolished in 1760; much of Cripplegate was gone by the 19th century and only small fragments of it survive today.

==The ward==
Cripplegate is one of the 25 ancient wards of the City of London, each electing an alderman to the Court of Aldermen and commoners (the City equivalent of a councillor) to the Court of Common Council of the City of London Corporation. Only electors who are Freemen of the City are eligible to stand. In the early 12th century, the area was originally referred to as &quot;Alwoldii&quot; which was probably the name of the current alderman. The early records are unreliable as regards who the Aldermen were, but from 1286 there is a more reliable list of Aldermen available.
The modern City of London spreads across a square mile of land and remains divided into 25 geographic areas, or &#x27;wards&#x27;. Four of these wards (Aldersgate, Portsoken, Queenhithe and Cripplegate), are described as &#x27;residential&#x27; as they contain the vast majority of all City residents.

===Geography===
The Ward of Cripplegate provides part of the Northern edge of the City and stretches from just below Old Street, down to London Wall at its southern tip, where it meets the Ward of Bassishaw. To the west is the Ward of Aldersgate and on the Eastern edge is Coleman Street.

The 2003 Ward Boundary Review recommended some significant changes for a number of wards and these were eventually implemented in 2013.

The Cripplegate Ward boundary used to extend a great deal further south, all the way down to Cheapside in fact. The ward was home to the halls of six livery companies and now only one remains (the Barber-Surgeons in Monkwell Square).

Each ward is represented by an assembly called the &#x27;Court of Common Council&#x27;. This consists of 100 common councilmen and 25 alderman (one for each Ward). The number of councilmen allocated to each particular ward is based on the size of the electorate and where Cripplegate used to warrant twelve members of council it is now reduced to nine.

The ward is promoted by the Cripplegate Ward Club. Founded in 1878, The Cripplegate Ward Club is a social organisation, encouraging its members to take an interest in the civic affairs of the City, while also supporting appeals and charitable activities. Cripplegate is among the busiest of the 20-plus ward clubs in the City of London, with a varied programme of events throughout the year.
The gate&#x27;s name is preserved in the church of St Giles-without-Cripplegate which is sited immediately outside the site of the former gate.
A small road named Cripplegate Street lies slightly to the north of the site of the gate between Viscount Street and Bridgewater Street.

===History of the ward===
The wards of London appear to have taken shape in the 11th century, before the Norman Conquest. Their administrative, judicial and military purpose made them equivalent to Hundreds in the countryside. The primary purpose of wards like Cripplegate, which included a gate, appears to have been the defence of the gate, as gates were the weakest points in any fortification.

&quot;Cripplegate Without&quot; was, in the 11th, 12th and possibly later centuries, part of an area outside the northern wall called the Soke of Cripplegate, held by the church of St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand.

In 1068, a burial site, where Jewin Street now stands, was the only place in England where Jews were permitted to be buried. Those living elsewhere in the country were forced, at great expense and inconvenience, to bring their dead there.

The philosopher Thomas More, writer of Utopia, was born on Milk Street in 1478.
In 1555, John Gresham endowed the new Gresham&#x27;s School in Norfolk with three tenements in the parish of St. Giles Without Cripplegate, including &#x27;The White Hind&#x27; and &#x27;The Peacock&#x27;.

During the Second World War, the Cripplegate area, a centre of the rag trade, was virtually destroyed and by 1951 the resident population of the City stood at only 5,324, of whom 48 lived in Cripplegate. Discussions began in 1952 about the future of the area, and the decision to build new residential properties was taken by the Court of Common Council on 19 September 1957. The area was reopened as the Barbican Estate in 1969.

Tranter&#x27;s Hotel was located at 6–9 Bridgewater Square, in a Georgian building with 60 rooms available, not far from today&#x27;s Beech Street, before being destroyed by the World War II bombs.

It was advertised in a number of periodicals and magazines between 1887 and 1919 as a very centrally located, family and commercial, temperance-friendly hotel, convenient for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and Aldersgate station, for business and pleasure.

===Politics===
Current elected representatives in Cripplegate are David Graves (Alderman), Mark Bostock, David Bradshaw, Mary Durcan, Vivienne Littlechild, Susan Pearson, William Pimlott, Stephen Quilter and John Tomlinson.

In the 2017 City-wide Common Council elections, the Labour Party won two seats in Cripplegate ward with local residents Mary Durcan and William Pimlott making Labour gains. The Labour Party won a record total of five seats on the Common Council in March 2017 winning two seats in Portsoken, two seats in Cripplegate ward and one seat in Aldersgate ward.

Following a boundary change in 1994, the Golden Lane Estate was transferred from Islington to the City, and so Cripplegate is today the most populous of the four residential wards of the City, with a population of 2,782 (2011).

==Other uses==
===Cripplegate Foundation===
Cripplegate Foundation is a registered charity and local grant-making foundation supporting residents in the London borough of Islington and a small area of the City of London. The Foundation&#x27;s vision is of a society where everyone can live a rewarding and fulfilled life, free from poverty and inequality. 

Cripplegate Foundation works to improve access to opportunities for everyone and to make lasting change. They do this by:

* listening to, and learning from, local people and communities,
* raising funds and making grants, and
* working in partnership with local people and organisations.

As a place-based funder, Cripplegate Foundation&#x27;s grants and programmes are available to Islington groups and residents based on their respective criteria. These include Islington Council&#x27;s Community Chest, Islington’s Resident Support Scheme (RSS), the Catalyst Programme, and Islington Giving funds. 

As well as awarding grants, Cripplegate Foundation offers a range of resources to Islington’s residents and voluntary organisations. These include innovative and practical research, advice and support, How Not What, a key outcome of the Development Partner programme, and office space available for booking by Islington voluntary groups.

=== History of Cripplegate Foundation ===
The Foundation dates its origins to the donation of £40 &quot;to provide trousers for local people&quot; on 2 April 1500. However it was only in 1891 that various local trusts were consolidated into the Cripplegate Foundation by the London Parochial Charities Act. Between 1896 and 1973 the foundation ran the Cripplegate Institute at the southern end of Golden Lane, a handsome &#x27;peoples palace&#x27; designed by architect Sidney Smith which contained a theatre and concert hall, a library free to residents and offices for social workers and from which grants to groups and individuals were given. The building was listed in 1987 but was sold by the Foundation and subsequently completely gutted by Swiss Bank UBS for its own offices.
From 1 April 2008 the area of benefit was expanded to include Islington. John Gilbert is the chair of the foundation, having been on the board of governors since 2005.

===Cripplegate Bank===
The Cripplegate Savings Bank was established in 1819 as a joint stock bank, then re-registered as Cripplegate Bank Ltd in 1879, and finally renamed London, Commercial &amp; Cripplegate Bank Ltd in 1900.
In between 1876-1906 the Cripplegate Bank was located at 31 and then 1 Whitecross Street, before been incorporated into the Union Bank of London, and finally been liquidated.

==In popular culture==
The second wedding in the film &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; takes place in the fictional church of St. Mary of the Fields, Cripplegate, EC2. It was filmed in the chapel of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich.

Cripplegate makes an appearance in the 2020 video game, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Valhalla&quot; as one of the restricted areas in London.

<doc id="381364" wikidata="Q1072280" url="?curid=381364" title="Casino chip">
<text>Casino chips (also known as poker chips, gaming tokens, or checks/cheques) are small discs used as currency in casinos. Larger, rectangular gaming plaques may be used for high-stakes games. Poker chips are also widely used as play money in casual or tournament games, are of numismatic value to casino chip collectors, or may be kept as souvenirs.

Chips and plaques used in table games may be made of a mixture of metal, clay, ceramic, and plastic materials inlayed or painted with colors and numbers indicating various denominations, while metal token coins are used primarily in slot machines. Some casinos embed RFID tags into chips to collect data and fight counterfeiting, and plaques may have printed serial numbers.

== Use ==
Money is exchanged for tokens in a casino at the casino cage, at the gaming tables, or at a cashier station. The tokens are interchangeable with money at the casino. As they are not legal tender, they generally have no value outside of the casino, but certain businesses (such as taxis or waiters—especially for tips) in gambling towns may honor them informally.

Tokens are employed for several reasons. Because of the uniform size, shape, and patterns of stacks of chips, they are easier to tally compared to currency. This attribute also enables the pit boss or security to quickly verify the amount being paid, reducing the chance that a dealer might incorrectly pay a customer. The uniform weight of the casino&#x27;s official tokens allows them to weigh great stacks or heaps of chips rather than tally them (though aids such as chip trays are far more common). Furthermore, it is observed that consumers gamble more freely with replacement currencies than with cash. A more pragmatic reason for casinos using chips in place of cash at table games is to discourage players from grabbing back their bet and attempting to flee should their bet not win, because chips, unlike cash, must be redeemed at the casino cashier and have no value outside the casino in question. Lastly, the chips are considered to be an integral part of the casino environment, and replacing them with some alternate currency would be unpopular.

Many casinos have eliminated the use of metal tokens (and coins) in their slot machines, in favor of paper receipts or pre-paid cards, which, while requiring heavy infrastructure costs to install, eliminate the coin handling expenses, jamming problems encountered in machines which took coins or tokens and can allow more game-specific technology in the space of a machine which would usually be dedicated to coin mechanisms. While some casinos (such as the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas) which installed the receipt system had kept the $1 tokens around for use as $1 chips, most other casinos using the receipts had simply scrapped the tokens entirely. Most casinos using receipts have automated machines at which customers may redeem receipts, eliminating the need for coin counting windows and decreasing labor costs.

Casino chip collecting is a part of numismatics, more specifically as specialized exonumia collecting. This hobby has become increasingly popular with the Casino Chips &amp; Gaming Tokens Collectors Club formed in 1988. Some collectors may value certain casino tokens up to $100,000, which are typically traded on online auction websites like eBay. Several casinos sell custom-made sets of chips and one or two decks of cards stamped with the name of the casino on them. Each set is contained in a small briefcase or box.

== History ==
The ancestors of modern casino tokens were the counters used to keep score in the card games Ombre and Quadrille. In 1752, French Quadrille sets contained a number of different counters, known as &quot;jetons&quot;, &quot;fiches&quot; and &quot;mils&quot;. Unlike modern poker chips, they were colored differently only to determine player ownership for purposes of settling payments at the end of the game, with different denominations differentiated by different shapes that each counter type had.

In the early history of Poker during the 19th century, players seemed to use any small valuable object imaginable. Early poker players sometimes used jagged gold pieces, gold nuggets, gold dust, or coins as well as &quot;chips&quot; primarily made of ivory, bone, wood, paper, and a composition made from clay and shellac. Several companies between the 1880s and the late 1930s made clay composition poker chips. There were over 1000 designs from which to choose. Most chips were white, red, blue, and yellow, but they could be made in almost any color desired.

== Construction ==

The vast majority of authentic casino chips are &quot;clay&quot; chips but can be more accurately described as compression molded chips. Contrary to popular belief, no gaming chip going as far back as the 1950s has been 100% clay. Modern clay chips are a composition of materials more durable than clay alone. At least some percentage of the chips is of an earthen material such as sand, chalk, and clay similar to that found in cat litter. The process used to make these chips is a trade secret, and varies slightly by manufacturer, most being relatively expensive and time-consuming per chip. The edge spots, or inserts, are not painted on; to achieve this effect, this area of the clay is removed and then replaced with clay of a different color; this can be done to each chip individually or a strip can be taken out of a cylindrical block of material and replaced with the alternate color before the block is cut into chips. Then each chip receives a mid-inlay if desired, and is placed in a special mold that compresses the chip, hence the term compression molded chips. The pressure of the compression and the heat that is added varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.

The printed graphics on clay chips is called an inlay. Inlays are typically made of paper and are then clad with a plastic film applied to the chip prior to the compression molding process. During the molding process, the inlay becomes permanently fastened to the chip and cannot be removed from the chip without destroying the inlay.

Ceramic chips were introduced in the mid-1980s as alternative to clay chips, and are also used in casinos, as well as being readily available to the home market. The ability to print lettering and graphics on the entire surface of the chip, instead of just the inlay, made them popular. Ceramic chips are sometimes also referred to as clay or clay composite, but they are in fact an injection molded chip made with a special plastic or resin formula that approximates the feel and sound of ceramic or porcelain. There are less expensive chips for the home market, made from various forms of plastic and plastic covered metal slugs as well.

The chips used in United States casinos typically weigh about 10 grams, but they can be between 8 and 16 g worldwide.

=== Colors ===

There is no universally standardized color scheme for poker chip values, and schemes not only vary nationally and regionally, but even from venue to venue, or by event type within a single venue.

Chip colors found in home sets typically include red, white, blue, and sometimes green and black; however, more recently a wide assortment of colors have become readily available, particularly in lower-cost ABS plastic chips. Common additional colors are pink, purple, yellow, orange, and grey. Newer designs in home chips include three-color designs where a three-step molding process creates a chip with unique base, secondary, and detail colors. As chip sets are tailored to the buyer, the values of various colors vary widely, with less traditional colors either used as very high values such as $500, $1,000, $5,000, and so forth, common in tournaments, or as special &quot;fractional&quot; values such as $2 or $0.50, common in low-limit games.

In casinos, uniform chip colors and sizes are sometimes specified by the local gaming control board for consistency. For example, regulations in New Jersey and Illinois specify similar uniform colors. Notably, Nevada has no regulations regarding color, which is why Nevada casinos may use white, blue, or gray as $1, though $5 through $5000 are almost always consistently colored. All US states where gambling is legal require that casino chips have a unique combination of edge spots for identification, the name and location of the casino and the chip&#x27;s value, if any, impressed, printed, or molded onto the obverse and reverse of the token.

In 19th-century United States, there was enough of a tradition of using blue chips for higher values that &quot;blue chip&quot; in noun and adjective senses signaling high-value chips and high-value property are attested since 1873 and 1894, respectively. This established connotation was first extended to the sense of a blue-chip stock in the 1920s.

$2.50 chips (colloquially referred to as &quot;snappers&quot; by chip collectors) are mostly used for blackjack tables, since a &quot;natural&quot; (a 21 on the first two cards dealt to a player) typically pays 3:2 and most wagers are in increments of $5. However, the Tropicana Casino and Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and others, have used $2.50 (pink) chips in $7.50 to $15 and $10 to $20 poker games.

$20 chips are used mostly at baccarat and pai gow poker because a 5% commission charged for all winning banker wagers at baccarat and winning wagers at pai gow converts evenly. Bets of $20 are not uncommon in traditional table games such as craps and roulette; a $20 chip, for example, places a $5 bet on each of the &quot;hard ways&quot; in craps and is preferable to passing a stack of chips or making change.

Because eight is considered a lucky number in Chinese culture, chips denominated 8, 88, and 888 (e.g., $8 in the US) are common in casinos catering to a Chinese clientele, often as a promotion for the Chinese Lunar New Year. They will sometimes contain an image of the animal associated with the year and are issued in a variety of colors.

Low-denomination yellow chips vary in value: $20 in Atlantic City and Illinois (which also uses &quot;mustard yellow&quot; $0.50 chips); $5 at most Southern California poker rooms; $2 at Foxwoods&#x27; poker room in Ledyard, Connecticut; Running Aces Casino &amp; Racetrack and Canterbury Park, both in Minnesota; and at Casino del Sol in Tucson, Arizona; and $0.50 at Potawatomi Hotel &amp; Casino in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Blue chips are occasionally used for $10, most notably in Atlantic City. In Las Vegas and California, most casinos use blue or white for $1 chips, though many Las Vegas casinos now use $1 metal tokens in lieu of chips.

Chips are also available in denominations of $1000 or more, depending on the wagering limits of the casino. Such chips are often yellow or orange.. Casinos in Nevada, Atlantic City, and other areas that permit high wagers typically have chips available in $5000, $10,000, $25,000, and more; the colors for these vary widely.

Denominations above $5000 are almost never encountered by the general public; their use is usually limited to &quot;high limit rooms&quot; where bet sizes are much greater than on the main floor. Casinos often use gaming plaques for these denominations: These plaques are about the size of a playing card, and must be marked with serial numbers. The greatest value placed on a plaque to date is $10 million, used at the London Club in Las Vegas.

Televised poker tournaments and cash games sometimes use bundled paper bills for high denominations, though the World Series of Poker and the World Poker Tour use round chips exclusively with denominations up to $250,000; tournament chips, however, are not redeemable for cash.

European casinos use a similar scheme, though certain venues, such as the Aviation Club de France, use pink for €2 and blue for €10. European casinos also use plaques rather than chips for high denominations, usually in the €1000 and higher range.

=== Security ===

Each casino has a unique set of chips, even if the casino is part of a greater company. This distinguishes a casino&#x27;s chips from others, since each chip and token on the gaming floor has to be backed up with the appropriate amount of cash. In addition, with the exception of Nevada, casinos are not permitted to honor another casino&#x27;s chips.

The security features of casino chips are numerous. Artwork is of a very high resolution or of photographic quality. Custom color combinations on the chip edge (edge spots) are usually distinctive to a particular casino. UV markings can be made on the inlay. Certain chips incorporate RFID technology, such as those at the Wynn Casino in Las Vegas. Also, makers&#x27; marks are difficult to reproduce.

Counterfeit chips are rare. High levels of surveillance, along with staff familiarity with chip design and coloring, make passing fake chips difficult. Casinos, though, are prepared for this situation. All states require that casinos have a set of chips in reserve with alternate markings, though they may not be required to have exactly the same number of reserve chips as they do on the floor. The most notable instance of counterfeiting chips was broken up in 2005, when two men were caught falsely converting $1 chips into higher denominations.

Casino chips used in tournaments are usually much cheaper and of much simpler design. Because the chips have no cash value, usually chips are designed with a single color (usually differing in shade or tone from the version on the casino floor), a smaller breadth, and a basic mark on the interior to distinguish denominations; however, at certain events (such as the World Series of Poker or other televised poker), chips approach quality levels of chips on the floor.

== Variations ==
Several casinos, such as the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, issue &quot;limited edition&quot; varied-designed chips, commemorating various events, though retaining a common color scheme. This encourages customers to keep them for souvenirs, at a profit to the casino.

In certain casinos, such as the Wynn and Encore casinos in Las Vegas, chips are embedded with RFID tags to help casinos keep better track of them, determine gamblers&#x27; average bet sizes, and to make them harder for counterfeiters to reproduce. However, this technique is costly and considered by many to be unnecessary for profit. Also, this technology provides minimal benefits in games with layouts that do not provide gamblers with their own designated betting areas, such as craps.

<doc id="381365" wikidata="Q533089" url="?curid=381365" title="Ludgate">
<text>Ludgate was the westernmost gate in London Wall. Of Roman origin, it was rebuilt several times and finally demolished on 30th July 1760. The name survives in Ludgate Hill, an eastward continuation of Fleet Street, Ludgate Circus and Ludgate Square. The gates&#x27; materials were sold for £148.

==Etymology==
According to legend, recorded by the Norman-Welsh cleric Geoffrey of Monmouth, Ludgate was named after the ancient British king Lud. Lud was said to be the brother of King Cassivelaunus but some folklorists think he is a manifestation of the god Nodens. There are other suggestions for the origins of the name, although none has been universally accepted. Later writers said it was derived from &quot;flood gate&quot; or &quot;Fleet gate&quot;, from &quot;ludgeat&quot;, meaning &quot;back gate&quot; or &quot;postern&quot;, or from the Old English term &quot;hlid-geat&quot; a common Old English compound meaning &quot;postern&quot; or &quot;swing gate&quot;.

==History==

Ludgate is believed to have been one of four original gates in the Roman London Wall, work on which started in 190 AD.

Anti-royalist forces rebuilt the gate during the First Barons&#x27; War (121517) using materials recovered from the destroyed houses of Jews. The gate was rebuilt about 1450 by a man called Foster who at one time was lodged in the debtor&#x27;s prison over the gate. He eventually became Sir Stephen Foster, Lord Mayor of London. His widow, Agnes, renovated and extended Ludgate and the debtor&#x27;s prison; the practice of making the debtors pay for their own food and lodging was also abolished. Her gift was commemorated by a brass wall plaque, which read:

&quot;Devout souls that pass this way,&quot;
&quot;For Stephen Foster, late mayor, heartily pray;&quot;
&quot;And Dame Agnes, his spouse, to God consecrate,&quot;
&quot;That of pity this house made, for Londoners in Ludgate;&quot;
&quot;So that for lodging and water prisoners here nought pay,&quot;
&quot;As their keepers shall answer at dreadful doomsday!&quot;
In February 1554, Ludgate was the final setting of Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion, when Sir Thomas Wyatt the Younger arrived at the gate with part of his army numbering three or four hundred men. The gate was defended by Lord William Howard with the local militia, who refused entry to the rebels, causing them to retreat and later surrender.

Ludgate was rebuilt in 1586 to the design of William Kerwin; niches in the facade were furnished with statues of Queen Elizabeth I and King Lud with his two sons; these statues replaced medieval ones that had been defaced by Protestant iconoclasts during the reign of King Edward VI. The gateway was finally demolished in 1760 at the request of the local citizens. It was still in use as a debtor&#x27;s prison, so the inmates were transferred to the City workhouse in Bishopsgate. The statues from the facade were preserved at the Church of St Dunstan-in-the-West in Fleet Street. When the church was rebuilt in 1831, they were sold and taken to Hertford Villa in Regent&#x27;s Park, but were returned to the church in 1935. Elizabeth&#x27;s statue now stands in a niche over the vestry door, while the others are inside the porch.

<text>Ludgate Hill is a street and surrounding area, on a small hill in the City of London, England. The street passes through the former site of Ludgate, a city gate that was demolished – along with a gaol attached to it – in 1760. 

The area includes St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The modern cathedral, it has been claimed, was built on a site that – during the Roman British era of the early first millennium – was occupied by a major Roman temple, dedicated to the goddess Diana. 

Ludgate Hill itself is traditionally regarded as one of a trio of hills in Central London, the others being Tower Hill and Cornhill. The highest point is just north of St Paul&#x27;s, at above sea level.

The modern street named Ludgate Hill, which was previously a much narrower thoroughfare named Ludgate Street, runs between St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard and Ludgate Circus (built in 1864), at which point it becomes Fleet Street.

==Etymology==
Ludgate is generally accepted to derive from the Old English term &quot;hlid-geat&quot; from &quot;hlid&quot; (&quot;lid, cover, opening, gate&quot;) and &quot;geat&quot; or &quot;gæt&quot; (&quot;gate, opening, passage&quot;) and was a common Old English compound meaning &quot;postern&quot; or &quot;swing gate&quot; and survives in various place names across England as well as in surnames.

Ludgate is mentioned in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, written around 1136. According to the pseudohistorical work the name comes from the mythic Welsh king Lud son of Heli whom he claims also gave his name to London. &quot;The Cronycullys of Englonde&quot; tell us of an early king of Britain: &quot;he lete make a fayre gate and called hit Lud Gate after his name&quot; in the year 66 , but it is more likely that the Romans were the first to build it, and that it is simply named after him. One proposed derivation, entirely prosaic, is that the name is a variation on &quot;Fleodgaet&quot;, or &quot;Fleet-gate&quot;.

==Description==
Many small alleys on Ludgate Hill were swept away in the mid 1860s to build Ludgate Hill railway station between Water Lane and New Bridge Street, a station of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. It was closed to passengers in 1929 and the railway bridge and viaduct between Holborn Viaduct and Blackfriars stations was demolished in 1990 to enable the construction of the City Thameslink railway station in a tunnel. This also involved the regrading of the slope of Ludgate Hill at the junction.

There is a blue plaque near the bottom of the hill with these words: &quot;In a house near this site was published in 1702 The &quot;Daily Courant&quot; first London daily newspaper&quot;.

About halfway up Ludgate Hill is the church of St Martin, Ludgate, once physically joined to the Ludgate.

Paternoster Square, home of the London Stock Exchange since 2004, is on the hill, immediately to the north of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Literary associations==

At the bottom of Ludgate Hill, on the north side, is Limeburner Lane. This may sound like a quaint survival from medieval times, but it was actually constructed in the 1990s, where Seacoal Lane used to be. This was the location of the Bell Savage Inn, first mentioned in 1452 where plays were performed. According to surveyor John Stow the name was derived from Isabella Savage, but Addison claimed it was &quot;La belle Sauvage&quot;, a woman in the wilderness. The clown Richard Tarlton used to perform here. It is mentioned in Thomas Hughes&#x27; &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; and Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;. In October 1684, a &quot;Rynoceros lately brought from the East Indies&quot; was put on show there. The inn was demolished in 1873. In 1851, part of it was rented out to John Cassell (1817–1865), a notable publisher. At this time it was still called La Belle Sauvage Yard and the firm of Cassell used &quot;la Belle Sauvage&quot; in some of their imprints.

The prison is mentioned in Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

From 1731, the &quot;London Coffee House&quot; was next to St Martin&#x27;s, Ludgate, at 24–26 Ludgate Hill. It was frequented by Joseph Priestley and Benjamin Franklin. When the juries at the Old Bailey failed to reach a verdict, they were housed here overnight. In 1806, a Roman hexagonal altar dedicated to Claudia Martina by her husband, now in the Guildhall, was found here together with a statue of Hercules. The London Coffee House was closed in 1867, and is now occupied by a pub called &quot;Ye Olde London&quot;.

Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Shepheardes Calender&quot; was printed by Hugh Singleton at the sign of the &quot;Gylden tunne&quot; in Creed Lane in 1579. John Evelyn lived in the Hawk and Pheasant on Ludgate Hill in 1658–59.

The Blackfriars, or Dominicans, first came to London in 1221. In 1278, they moved from Holborn to an area south of Ludgate, where they built a friary. By 1320, they had demolished the Roman wall to build a new wall for the friary. This was demolished at the Reformation, but the name persisted – in 1596 James Burbage, the manager of Shakespeare&#x27;s acting company, The Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, acquired the lease to a part of the property that was already being used as a theatre. His intention appears to have been to have the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men act here. However, local opposition meant that the more fashionable children&#x27;s acting companies who were already performing here continued to act here for some years instead. It wasn&#x27;t until 1609 that Shakespeare&#x27;s company of actors (by then called The King&#x27;s Men) was able to act at the Blackfriars Theatre. In 1613, Shakespeare bought the Blackfriars gate-house.

Pageantmaster Court is almost opposite St. Martin&#x27;s. The name is not medieval but dates from 1993. However, to the west is King&#x27;s Arms Court, which existed until recently. Grinling Gibbons lived there. According to Stow, the gate acquired statues in 1260. In the reign of Edward VI the heads were &quot;smitten off&quot; and a few years later &quot;Queen Mary did set new heads upon their old bodies again&quot;.

William Hone, journalist and publisher had an office near Ludgate Hill and the Old Bailey during the mid 1800s.

== Notable residents ==
* Samuel Birch (military officer)
* William Harvey (1578–1657) – discovered the circulation of the blood, 1628. From 1604 to 1639 Harvey held a residence in the precincts of St Martin&#x27;s Church, Ludgate.

<text>Christine Jorgensen (; May 30, 1926 – May 3, 1989), born George William Jorgensen Jr., was an American actress, singer, recording artist, and transgender activist. A trans woman, she was the first person to become widely known in the United States for having sex reassignment surgery.

In 1944, Jorgensen was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War II. After she served as a military clerical worker, Jorgensen attended several schools, worked, and pursued a photography career. During this time, she learned about sex reassignment surgery and traveled to Europe, where in Copenhagen, Denmark, she obtained special permission to undergo a series of operations beginning in 1952.

Upon her return to the United States in the early 1950s, her transition was the subject of a &quot;New York Daily News&quot; front-page story. She became an instant celebrity, known for her directness and polished wit, and used the platform to advocate for transgender people. 

Her 1967 autobiography &quot;Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Autobiography&quot; sold almost 450,000 copies. Throughout her career, she gave lectures at colleges at university on the topics of transsexuality, though she would later disassociate with the term &quot;transsexual&quot; and prefer the term transgender.

==Early life==
Jorgensen was the second child of carpenter and contractor George William Jorgensen and his wife, Florence Davis Hansen. She was named George William, after her father, when she was born. She was raised in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City, and baptized a Lutheran. She described herself as a &quot;frail, blond, introverted little boy who ran from fistfights and rough-and-tumble games&quot;.

Jorgensen graduated from Christopher Columbus High School in 1945 and was soon drafted into the U.S. Army at 19. After being discharged from the Army, she attended Mohawk Valley Community College in Utica, New York; the Progressive School of Photography in New Haven, Connecticut; and the Manhattan Medical and Dental Assistant School in New York City. She also worked briefly for Pathé News.

==Gender transition==
Returning to New York after military service, and increasingly concerned over, as one obituary later called it, a &quot;lack of male physical development&quot;, Jorgensen heard about sex reassignment surgery. She began taking estrogen in the form of ethinylestradiol. She started researching the surgery with the help of Joseph Angelo, the husband of a classmate at the Manhattan Medical and Dental Assistant School. Jorgensen intended to go to Sweden, where the only doctors worldwide who performed the surgery were located. During a stopover in Copenhagen to visit relatives, she met Christian Hamburger, a Danish endocrinologist and specialist in rehabilitative hormonal therapy associated with the Serum Institute. Jorgensen stayed in Denmark and underwent hormone replacement therapy under Hamburger&#x27;s direction. She chose the name &quot;Christine&quot; in honor of Hamburger.

Doctor Hamburger explained the gender hormone procedure, &quot;The first sign was an increase in size of the mammary glands and then hair began to grow where the patient had a bald patch on the temple. Finally the whole body changed from a male to a female shape&quot;. More than a year after beginning hormone therapy, Jorgensen received her first surgery. Professor E. Dahl-Iverson of the Danish State Hospital was named as one of her surgeons, performing &quot;one minor and 4 major operations on her successfully.&quot; However, she never publicly explained her new anatomy or the surgery outcome but said, &quot;Everyone is both sexes in varying degrees. I am more of a woman than a man... Of course I can never have children but this does not mean that I cannot have natural sexual intercourse – I am very much in the position right now of a woman who has a hysterectomy,&quot; in 1958.

Her parents were from Denmark, so her trip for reassignment surgery was easy to disguise as a trip to visit family. She did not relay her plan for procedures on the trip to anyone due to her concern that she would not be supported.

She obtained special permission from the Danish Minister of Justice Helga Pedersen to receive funding to undergo a series of operations in Denmark. On September 24, 1951, surgeons at Gentofte Hospital in Copenhagen performed an orchiectomy on Jorgensen. In a letter to friends on October 8, 1951, she referred to how the surgery affected her:

In November 1952, doctors at Copenhagen University Hospital performed a penectomy. In Jorgensen&#x27;s words, &quot;My second operation, as the previous one, was not such a major work of surgery as it may imply.&quot; In 1952, she was quoted in &quot;Scope Magazine&quot; as saying, I was one of those people . . . . It was not an easy task for me to face, but only for the happiness it brought me I should not have had the strength to go through these past two years. You see, I was afraid of a much more horrible illness of the mind. She returned to the United States and eventually obtained a vaginoplasty when the procedure became available. The vaginoplasty was performed under the direction of Dr. Angelo, with Harry Benjamin as a medical adviser. Later, in the preface of Jorgensen&#x27;s autobiography, Harry Benjamin gave her credit for the advancement of his studies. He wrote, &quot;Indeed, Christine, without you, probably none of this would have happened; the grant, my publications, lectures, etc.&quot;

In a 1980s Hour Magazine interview with Gary Collins, Jorgensen described her family&#x27;s acceptance:My family were very understanding. They had a choice; I gave them only one choice. Either they were to accept me or there was a break. My family did not want to lose me, and I was very close with [my mother and father] until they died.

==Publicity==
Jorgensen was publicly outed when her letter to her parents in New York leaked to the press. She had planned to keep her transition a secret but she was forcefully outed by the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;. Her letter stated, &quot;Nature made a mistake which I have had corrected, and now I am your daughter.&quot;

The New York &quot;Daily News&quot; ran a front-page story on December 1, 1952, under the headline &quot;Ex-GI Becomes Blonde Beauty&quot;, announcing (incorrectly) that Jorgensen had become the recipient of the first &quot;sex change.&quot; In reality, German doctors had performed this type of surgery in the late 1920s and early 1930s; Dorchen Richter and Danish artist Lili Elbe, both patients of Magnus Hirschfeld at the &quot;Institut für Sexualwissenschaft&quot; in Berlin, were known recipients of such operations, however Elbe died after developing sepsis due to complications from an attempted uterus transplant.

After her surgeries, Jorgensen originally stated that she wanted a quiet life of her design. However, upon returning to the United States, she could only earn a living by making public appearances. Jorgensen was an instant celebrity when she returned to New York in February 1953. A large crowd of journalists met her as she came off her flight, and despite the Danish royal family being on the same flight, the audience largely ignored them in favor of Jorgensen. Soon after her arrival, she launched a successful nightclub act and appeared on television, radio, and theatrical productions. The first five-part authorized account of her story was written by herself in a February 1953 issue of &quot;The American Weekly&quot;, titled &quot;The Story of My Life.&quot; In 1967, she published her autobiography, &quot;Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Autobiography&quot;, which sold almost 450,000 copies.

In the wake of her transition, part of the media coverage debated her original gender identity, many claiming that she was never fully male, but rather intersex. At the time, a popular theory was that she was a &quot;pseudohermaphrodite&quot; with the internal anatomy of a female and the external anatomy of a male. Nothing that Jorgensen said explicitly supported this theory, but various professionals adopted it anyway. This theory was also used to downplay the importance of Jorgensen&#x27;s transition, with doctors claiming that her surgeries were &quot;far from a medical rarity... [with] similar cases in hospitals all over the U.S.&quot;. Others insisted that Jorgensen&#x27;s pre-transition body was clearly male and the surgeries were not to mend a physical abnormality, but rather &quot;align her gender with her physical sex.&quot; The overwhelming amount of coverage opened new discussions surrounding gender, sex, and transsexuals. 

The publicity following her transition and gender reassignment surgery became &quot;a model for other transsexuals for decades. She was a tireless lecturer on the subject of transsexuality, pleading for understanding from a public that all too often wanted to see transsexuals as freaks or perverts... Ms Jorgensen&#x27;s poise, charm, and wit won the hearts of millions.&quot; However, over time the press was much less fascinated by her and started to scrutinize her much more harshly. Print media often asked her if she would pose nude in their publications. 

According to a 1985 publication, Jorgensen opposed the word &quot;transsexual&quot; due to the word &quot;sex,&quot; in her opinion, only being relevant to sexual intercourse. She stated, &quot;I am a transgender because gender refers to who you are as a human.&quot;

==Later life==
After her vaginoplasty, Jorgensen planned to marry labor union statistician John Traub, but the engagement was called off. In 1959 she announced her engagement to typist Howard J. Knox in Massapequa Park, New York, where her father built her a house after reassignment surgery. She and Knox settled down and joined a Lutheran church. However, the couple was unable to obtain a marriage license because Jorgensen&#x27;s birth certificate listed her as male. In a report about the broken engagement, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Knox had lost his job in Washington, D.C. when his engagement to Jorgensen became known.

After her parents died, Jorgensen moved to California in 1967. She left behind the ranch home built by her father in Massapequa and settled at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. During this same year, Jorgensen published her autobiography, &quot;Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Autobiography&quot;, which chronicled her life experiences as a transgender woman and included her perspectives on some of her significant life events. In her autobiography, Jorgensen revealed her struggles with depression. She explained how her mental health deteriorated and led her to contemplate suicide but did not act on it. She wrote, &quot;The answer to the problem must not lie in sleeping pills and suicides that look like accidents, or in jail sentences, but rather in life and the freedom to live it.&quot;

During the 1970s and 1980s, Jorgensen toured university campuses and other venues to speak about her experiences. She was known for her directness and polished wit. She once demanded an apology from Vice President Spiro T. Agnew when he called Charles Goodell &quot;the Christine Jorgensen of the Republican Party.&quot; Agnew refused her request.

Jorgensen also worked as an actress and nightclub entertainer and recorded several songs. In summer stock, she played Madame Rosepettle in the play &quot;Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma&#x27;s Hung You in the Closet and I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; So Sad&quot;. 

Circa 1958, while she was performing at the Latin Quarter in New York, she saw the 1958 musical &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; on Broadway. There, she saw Pat Suzuki perform &quot;I Enjoy Being a Girl,&quot; which shortly became Jorgensen&#x27;s &quot;theme song.&quot; Jorgensen included the song in her nightclub act, incorporating a quick-change into a Wonder Woman costume. Warner Communications, owners of the Wonder Woman character&#x27;s copyright, demanded she stop using the character in 1981. She did so, using instead a new character, Superwoman, who was marked by the inclusion of a large letter &quot;S&quot; on her cape; apparently DC Comics, which trademarked the character in 1947, was either unaware of, or unconcerned by this use.

Jorgensen continued her act, performing at Freddy&#x27;s Supper Club on the Upper East Side of Manhattan until at least 1982 when she performed twice in the Hollywood area: once at the Backlot Theatre, adjacent to the discothèque Studio One, and later at The Frog Pond restaurant. The performance was recorded and made available as an album on iTunes. In 1984, Jorgensen returned to Copenhagen to perform her show and was featured in Teit Ritzau&#x27;s Danish transgender documentary film &quot;Paradiset er ikke til salg&quot; (&quot;Paradise Is Not for Sale&quot;). Jorgensen was the first and only known trans woman to perform at Oscar&#x27;s Delmonico Restaurant in downtown New York, for which owners Oscar and Mario Tucci received criticism.

She died of bladder and lung cancer on May 3, 1989, at age 62. Her ashes were scattered off Dana Point, California.

==Legacy==
Jorgensen&#x27;s highly publicized transition helped bring to light gender identity and shaped a new culture of more inclusive ideas about the subject. As a transgender spokesperson and public figure, she influenced other transgender people to change their sex and names on their birth certificates. Jorgensen saw herself as a founding member in what became known as the &quot;sexual revolution.&quot; In a 1988 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; interview, Jorgensen stated, &quot;I am very proud now, looking back, that I was on that street corner 36 years ago when a movement started. It was the sexual revolution that was going to start with or without me. We may not have started it, but we gave it a good swift kick in the pants.&quot;

In 2012, Jorgensen was inducted into Chicago&#x27;s Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display celebrating LGBTQ history and people.

In 2014, Jorgensen was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro neighborhood, noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields&quot;.

In June 2019, Jorgensen was one of the inaugural 50 American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; included on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall&#x27;s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

==In popular culture==
During the 1950s, entrepreneurs and romantic partners Chuck Renslow and Dom Orejudos founded Kris Studios, a male physique photography studio that took photos for beefcake magazines they published, which was named in part to honor Jorgensen as a transgender pioneer. Kris Studios&#x27; photos are housed at the Leather Archives &amp; Museum.

Posters for the Ed Wood film &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; (1953), also known as &quot;I Changed My Sex&quot; and &quot;I Led Two Lives&quot;, publicize the movie as being based on Jorgensen&#x27;s life. Originally producer George Weiss made her some offers to appear in the film, but she turned them down. Jorgensen is mentioned in connection with &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; in Tim Burton&#x27;s biopic &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994), but Jorgensen is not depicted as a character.

In 1954, during his earlier career as a calypso singer under the name The Charmer, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan recorded a song about Jorgensen, &quot;Is She Is or Is She Ain&#x27;t.&quot; (The title is a play on the 1940s Louis Jordan song, &quot;Is You Is or Is You Ain&#x27;t My Baby&quot;.)

&quot;The Christine Jorgensen Story&quot;, a fictionalized biopic based on Jorgensen&#x27;s memoir, premiered in 1970. John Hansen played Jorgensen as an adult, while Trent Lehman played her at age seven.

In &quot;Christine Jorgensen Reveals&quot;, a stage performance at the 2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Jorgensen was portrayed by Bradford Louryk. To critical acclaim, Louryk dressed as Jorgensen and performed in a recorded interview with her during the 1950s. At the same time, a video of Rob Grace as comically inept interviewer Nipsey Russell played on a nearby black-and-white television set. The show went on to win Best Aspect of Production at the 2006 Dublin Gay Theatre Festival, and it ran Off-Broadway at New World Stages in January 2006. The LP was reissued on CD by Repeat The Beat Records in 2005.

Transgender historian and critical theorist Susan Stryker directed and produced an experimental documentary about Jorgensen, titled &quot;Christine in the Cutting Room&quot;. In 2010 she also presented a lecture at Yale University titled &quot;Christine in the Cutting Room: Christine Jorgensen&#x27;s Transsexual Celebrity and Cinematic Embodiment&quot;. Both works examine embodiment vis-à-vis cinema.

Journalist Claudia Kalb&#x27;s 2016 book &quot;Andy Warhol Was a Hoarder: Inside the Minds of History&#x27;s Great Personalities&quot; devotes a chapter to Jorgensen&#x27;s story, using her as an example of gender dysphoria and the process of gender transition in the 20th century.

<text>The London Mithraeum, also known as the Temple of Mithras, Walbrook, is a Roman Mithraeum that was discovered in Walbrook, a street in the City of London, during a building&#x27;s construction in 1954. The entire site was relocated to permit continued construction and this temple of the mystery god Mithras became perhaps the most famous 20th-century Roman discovery in London.

== Excavation and artefacts ==

The site was excavated by W. F. Grimes, director of the Museum of London, and Audrey Williams in 1954. The temple, initially hoped to have been an early Christian church, was built in the mid-3rd century and dedicated to Mithras or perhaps jointly to several deities popular among Roman soldiers. Then it was rededicated, probably to Bacchus, in the early fourth century. Found within the temple, where they had been carefully buried at the time of its rededication, were finely detailed third-century white marble likenesses of Minerva, Mercury the guide of the souls of the dead, and the syncretic gods Mithras and Serapis, imported from Italy. There were several coarser locally-made clay figurines of Venus, combing her hair. The artefacts recovered were put on display in the Museum of London.
Among the sculptures the archaeologists found was a head of Mithras himself, recognizable by his Phrygian cap. The base of the head is tapered to fit a torso, which was not preserved.

Artefacts found in Walbrook in 1889 probably came from the Mithraeum, according to the archaeologist Ralph Merrifield, although this was not identified at the time. One was a marble relief, 0.53 m tall, of Mithras in the act of killing the astral bull, the Tauroctony that was as central to Mithraism as the Crucifixion is to Christianity. On it Mithras is accompanied by the two small figures of the torch-bearing celestial twins of Light and Darkness, Cautes and Cautopates, within the cosmic annual wheel of the zodiac. At the top left, outside the wheel, Sol–Helios ascends the heavens in his &quot;biga&quot;; at top right Luna descends in her chariot. The heads of two wind-gods, Boreas and Zephyros, are in the bottom corners. It bears the inscription

which may be translated &quot;Ulpius Silvanus, veteran soldier of the Second Augustan Legion, in fulfilment of a vow, makes this altar [as the result of] a vision&quot; or &quot;Ulpius Silvanus, veteran of the Second Legion Augusta, fulfilled his vow having become (a Mithraist) at Orange&quot;

Nearby were buried heads of the Roman goddess Minerva and a finely detailed bearded head of Serapis, Jupiter-like in his features but securely recognizable by the grain-basket, the &quot;modius&quot;, upon his head, a token of resurrection.

An inscription dateable AD 307–310 at the site

may be translated &quot;For the Salvation of our lords the four emperors and the noble Caesar, and to the god Mithras, the Invincible Sun from the east to the west&quot;.

Prior to the construction of the Bloomberg London building, Museum of London Archaeology led a team of over 50 archaeologists in further excavation of the site between 2010 and 2013. Their work recovered more than 14,000 items, including a large assembly of tools. The varied objects are thought to have been brought to the site in landfills and soils collected elsewhere and laid down to improve the marshy banks of the River Walbrook during the rebuilding of London after the Boudican revolt of AD 60 or 61.
The waterlogged soil conditions in this location preserved even organic material like leather shoes and an assembly of over 400 wooden writing tablets, collectively known as the Bloomberg tablets. The tablets originally held a layer of dark wax and messages were scratched into the wax with a stylus that revealed the paler wood underneath. The wax has perished, but the words were reconstructed from scratch marks left in the wood. Among the messages is the oldest financial document from London, dated AD 57, and two addresses from AD 62 and AD 70 containing the earliest mention of London.

== Relocation history ==
The Roman temple, when it was originally built, would have stood on the east bank of the now covered-over River Walbrook, a key freshwater source in Roman Londinium. Nearby, in its former streambed, a small square hammered lead sheet was found, on which an enemy of someone named Martia Martina had inscribed her name &quot;backwards&quot; and thrown the token into the stream, in a traditional Celtic way of reaching the gods that has preserved metal tokens in rivers throughout Celtic Europe, from the swords at La Tène to Roman times (compare wishing well.) The temple foundations are very close to other important sites in the city of London including the historic London Stone, the Bank of England and London Wall. The original Mithraeum was built partly underground, recalling the cave of Mithras where the Mithraic epiphany took place.

The temple site was uncovered in September 1954 during excavation work for the construction of Bucklersbury House, a 14-storey modernist office block to house Legal &amp; General. As a compromise between redesigning the new building and abandoning the archaeological site, the ruin was dismantled and moved 100 metres to Temple Court, Queen Victoria Street, where in 1962 the foundations were reassembled at street level for an open-air public display. The reconstruction was not accurate and drew criticism for the materials used. An interim report on the excavation included in W. F. Grimes, &quot;The Excavation of Roman and Mediaeval London&quot; (1968) was superseded by John Shepherd, &quot;The Temple of Mithras, Walbrook&quot; (an English Heritage monograph) (1998).

In 2007 plans were drawn up to return the Mithraeum to its original location, following the demolition of Bucklersbury House and four other buildings in the block for the planned creation of a new Walbrook Square development, designed by Foster and Partners and Jean Nouvel Architects. However, redesigns and disputes between freeholders Legal &amp; General and Metrovacesa, who had agreed to buy the project, resulted in the Walbrook Square project being put on hold in October 2008, when Bovis Lend Lease removed their project team. Metrovacesa left the project in August 2009. In May 2010 the Mithraeum remained &quot;in situ&quot; at Temple Court, though in the same month there was talk of reviving the Walbrook Square project.

The Walbrook Square project was purchased by the Bloomberg company in 2010, which decided to restore the Mithraeum to its original site as part of their new European headquarters opened in 2017. The new site is below the modern street level in an exhibition space beneath the Bloomberg London building. The temple was moved a little west of its original position to preserve parts of the walls that were not uncovered in 1952–54 and are too fragile to display today. 

The ruins are reconstructed as they appeared at the end of the excavation in October 1954, reflecting the first building phase of around AD 240 without any later Roman additions to the site. A large majority of the stones and bricks are original. The wood, render and lime mortar are new, but based on mortar samples from contemporary Roman London structures. The temple is displayed with a selection of artefacts found on the site.

<doc id="381378" wikidata="Q1704645" url="?curid=381378" title="A Visit from St. Nicholas">
<text>&quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot;, routinely referred to as &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; and &quot;″Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot; from its first line, is a poem first published anonymously under the title &quot;Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; in 1823. Authorship has been attributed to Clement Clarke Moore, who claimed authorship in 1837, but it has also been suggested that Henry Livingston Jr. may have written it.

The poem has been called &quot;arguably the best-known verses ever written by an American&quot; and is largely responsible for some of the conceptions of Santa Claus from the mid-19th century to today. It has had a massive effect on the history of Christmas gift-giving. Before the poem gained wide popularity, American ideas had varied considerably about Saint Nicholas and other Christmastide visitors. &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; eventually was set to music and has been recorded by several artists.

== Plot ==
On the night of Christmas Eve, a family is settling down to sleep when the father is awakened by noises on their lawn. Looking out the window, he sees Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas, in a sleigh pulled by eight reindeer. 

After landing his sleigh on the roof, Santa bounds down the chimney. He carries a sack of toys, and the father watches his visitor deliver presents and fill the stockings hanging by the fireplace, and laughs to himself. They share a conspiratorial moment before Santa bounds up the chimney again. As he flies away, Santa calls out &quot;Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night.&quot;

==History ==
The authorship of &quot;A Visit&quot; is credited to Clement Clarke Moore who is said to have composed it on a snowy winter&#x27;s day during a shopping trip on a sleigh. His inspiration for the character of Saint Nicholas was a local Dutch handyman as well as the historic Saint Nicholas. 

Moore originated many of the features that are still associated with Santa Claus today while borrowing other aspects, such as the use of reindeer. The poem was first published anonymously in the Troy, New York &quot;Sentinel&quot; on December 23, 1823, having been sent there by a friend of Moore, and was reprinted frequently thereafter with no name attached. It was first attributed in print to Moore in 1837. 

In 1842, the noted poet and editor William Cullen Bryant credited Moore as the author when he included the piece in an anthology of American poetry he had compiled. Moore himself acknowledged authorship when he included it in his own book of poems in 1844. By then, the original publisher and at least seven others had already acknowledged his authorship. Moore had a reputation as an erudite professor and had not wished at first to be connected with the unscholarly verse. He included it in the anthology at the insistence of his children, for whom he had originally written the piece.

Moore&#x27;s conception of Saint Nicholas was borrowed from his friend Washington Irving, but Moore portrayed his &quot;jolly old elf&quot; as arriving on Christmas Eve rather than Christmas Day. At the time that Moore wrote the poem, Christmas Day was overtaking New Year&#x27;s Day as the preferred genteel family holiday of the season, but some Protestants viewed Christmas as the result of &quot;Catholic ignorance and deception&quot; and still had reservations. By having Saint Nicholas arrive the night before, Moore &quot;deftly shifted the focus away from Christmas Day with its still-problematic religious associations&quot;. As a result, &quot;New Yorkers embraced Moore&#x27;s child-centered version of Christmas as if they had been doing it all their lives.&quot;

In &quot;An American Anthology, 1787–1900&quot;, editor Edmund Clarence Stedman reprinted the Moore version of the poem, including the Dutch spelling of &quot;Donder&quot; and German spelling of &quot;Blitzen&quot; that he adopted, rather than the version from 1823 &quot;Dunder and Blixem&quot; that is more similar to the old Dutch &quot;Donder en Blixem&quot; that translates to &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot;.

===Authorship controversy===
Moore&#x27;s connection with the poem has been questioned by Professor Donald Foster, who used textual content analysis and external evidence to argue that Moore could not have been the author. Foster believes that Major Henry Livingston Jr., a New Yorker with Dutch and Scottish roots, should be considered the chief candidate for authorship, a view long espoused by the Livingston family. Livingston was distantly related to Moore&#x27;s wife. 

Foster&#x27;s claim, however, has been countered by document dealer and historian Seth Kaller, who once owned one of Moore&#x27;s original manuscripts of the poem. Kaller has offered a point-by-point rebuttal of both Foster&#x27;s linguistic analysis and external findings, buttressed by the work of autograph expert James Lowe and Joe Nickell, author of &quot;Pen, Ink and Evidence.&quot;

====Evidence in favor of Moore====
On January 20, 1829, Troy editor Orville L. Holley alluded to the author of the Christmas poem, using terms that accurately described Moore as a native and current resident of New York City, and as &quot;a gentleman of &quot;more&quot; merit as a scholar and a writer than many of more noisy pretensions&quot;. In December 1833, a diary entry by Francis P. Lee, a student at General Theological Seminary when Moore taught there, referred to a holiday figure of St. Nicholas as being &quot;robed in fur, and dressed according to the description of Prof. Moore in his poem&quot;. 

Four poems including &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; appeared under Moore&#x27;s name in &quot;The New-York Book of Poetry&quot;, edited by Charles Fenno Hoffman (New York: George Dearborn, 1837). The Christmas poem appears on pp. 217–19, credited to &quot;Clement C. Moore&quot;. Moore stated in a letter to the editor of the New York American (published on March 1, 1844) that he &quot;gave the publisher&quot; of &quot;The New-York Book of Poetry&quot; &quot;several pieces, among which was the &#x27;Visit from St. Nicholas.&#x27;&quot; Admitting that he wrote it &quot;not for publication, but to amuse my children,&quot; Moore claimed the Christmas poem in this 1844 letter as his &quot;literary property, however small the intrinsic value of that property may be&quot;. 

&quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; appears on pp. 124–27 in Moore&#x27;s volume of collected &quot;Poems&quot; (New York: Bartlett and Welford, 1844). Prior to 1844, the poem was included in two 1840 anthologies, attributed to &quot;Clement C. Moore&quot; in &quot;Selections from The American Poets&quot;, edited by William Cullen Bryant (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1840), pp. 285–86; and to &quot;C. C. Moore&quot; in the first volume of &quot;The Poets of America&quot;, edited by John Keese (New York: S. Colman, 1840), pp. 102–04. The New-York Historical Society has a later manuscript of the poem in Moore&#x27;s handwriting, forwarded by T. W. C. Moore along with a cover letter dated March 15, 1862, giving circumstances of the poem&#x27;s original composition and transmission after a personal &quot;interview&quot; with Clement C. Moore.

After &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; appeared under Moore&#x27;s name in the 1837 &quot;New-York Book of Poetry&quot;, newspaper printings of the poem often credited Moore as the author. For example, the poem is credited to &quot;Professor Moore&quot; in the December 25, 1837 &quot;Pennsylvania Inquirer and Daily Courier&quot;. Although Moore did not authorize the earliest publication of the poem in the Troy &quot;Sentinel&quot;, he had close ties to Troy through the Protestant Episcopal Church that could explain how it got there. Harriet Butler of Troy, New York (daughter of the Rev. David Butler) who allegedly showed the poem to &quot;Sentinel&quot; editor Orville L. Holley, was a family friend of Moore&#x27;s and possibly a distant relative. A letter to Moore from the publisher Norman Tuttle states, &quot;I understand from Mr. Holley that he received it from Mrs. Sackett, the wife of Mr. Daniel Sackett who was then a merchant in this city&quot;. 

The reported involvement of two women, Harriet Butler and Sarah Sackett, as intermediaries is consistent with the 1862 account of the poem&#x27;s earliest transmission in which T. W. C. Moore describes two stages of copying, first &quot;by a relative of Dr Moores in her Album&quot; and second, &quot;by a friend of hers, from Troy&quot;. Moore preferred to be known for his more scholarly works, but allowed the poem to be included in his anthology in 1844 at the request of his children. 

By that time, the original publisher and at least seven others had already acknowledged his authorship. Livingston family lore gives credit to their forebear rather than Moore, but there is no proof that Livingston himself ever claimed authorship, nor has any record ever been found of any printing of the poem with Livingston&#x27;s name attached to it, despite more than 40 years of searches.

While textual analyses by English scholars have pointed to Livingston as the likelier author, subsequent tests using forensic linguistics techniques developed by computer scientists have come to the opposite conclusion. In his 2023 book &quot;The Fight for &quot;The Night&quot;: Resolving the Authorship Dispute over &quot;The Night Before Christmas,&quot;&quot; retired litigator Tom A. Jerman reported using Duquesne University computer scientist Patrick Juola&#x27;s Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program to compare the poem to the works of Moore and Livingston, with 16 of 17 tests pointing to Moore as the likelier author. Also that year, computer scientist Shlomo Argamon, then of the Illinois Institute of Technology, analyzed the poem alongside texts from Moore, Livingston and five other authors of the era and concluded that “Moore is much more likely to be the author than Livingston,” and “it’s more likely authored by either Moore or Livingston than any of the other guys.”

====Evidence in favor of Livingston====


Advocates for Livingston&#x27;s authorship argue that Moore &quot;tried at first to disavow&quot; the poem. They also posit that Moore falsely claimed to have translated a book. Document dealer and historian Seth Kaller has challenged both claims. Kaller examined the book in question, &quot;A Complete Treatise on Merinos and Other Sheep&quot;, as well as many letters signed by Moore, and found that the &quot;signature&quot; was not penned by Moore, and thus provides no evidence that Moore made any plagiaristic claim. Kaller&#x27;s findings were confirmed by autograph expert James Lowe, by Dr. Joe Nickell, the author of &quot;Pen, Ink &amp; Evidence,&quot; and by others. According to Kaller, Moore&#x27;s name was likely written on the book by a New-York Historical Society cataloger to indicate that it had been a gift from Moore to the Society.

The following points have been advanced in order to credit the poem to Major Henry Livingston Jr.:

Livingston also wrote poetry primarily using an anapaestic metrical scheme, and it is claimed that some of the phraseology of &quot;A Visit&quot; is consistent with other poems by Livingston, and that Livingston&#x27;s poetry is more optimistic than Moore&#x27;s poetry published in his own name. But Stephen Nissenbaum argues in &quot;Battle for Christmas&quot; that the poem could have been a social satire of the Victorianization of Christmas. Kaller claims that Foster cherry-picked only the poems that fit his thesis and that many of Moore&#x27;s unpublished works have a tenor, phraseology, and meter similar to &quot;A Visit&quot;. Moore had even written a letter titled &quot;From Saint Nicholas&quot; that may have predated 1823.

Foster also contends that Moore hated tobacco and would, therefore, never have depicted Saint Nicholas with a pipe. However, Kaller notes, the source of evidence for Moore&#x27;s supposed disapproval of tobacco is &quot;The Wine Drinker&quot;, another poem by him. In actuality, that verse contradicts such a claim. Moore&#x27;s &quot;The Wine Drinker&quot; criticizes self-righteous, hypocritical advocates of temperance who secretly indulge in the substances which they publicly oppose, and supports the social use of tobacco in moderation and wine and opium, which was more acceptable then than now.

 Foster also asserts that Livingston&#x27;s mother was Dutch, which accounts for the references to the Dutch &quot;Sinteklaes&quot; tradition and the use of the Dutch names &quot;Dunder and Blixem&quot;. Against this claim, it is suggested by Kaller that Moore – a friend of writer Washington Irving and member of the same literary society – may have acquired some of his knowledge of New York Dutch traditions from Irving. Irving had written &quot;A History of New York&quot; in 1809 under the name of &quot;Dietrich Knickerbocker&quot;. It includes several references to legends of Saint Nicholas, including the following that bears a close relationship to the poem:

MacDonald P. Jackson, a professor emeritus at the University of Auckland and a fellow at the Royal Society of New Zealand, authored a book in 2016, &quot;Who Wrote &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;?: Analyzing the Clement Clarke Moore Vs. Henry Livingston Question&quot;, in which he evaluates the opposing arguments, using author-attribution techniques of modern computational stylistics to examine the long-standing controversy. Employing a range of tests, including a statistical analysis of phonemes, Jackson contends that Livingston authored the classic poem.

==Musical adaptations==
Parts of the poem have been set to music numerous times, including a bowdlerized version (that omitted several verses such as &quot;The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow ... etc.&quot;. and rewrote and replaced many others such as &quot;the prancing and pawing of each little hoof&quot; with &quot;the clattering noise of each galloping hoof&quot;), by the American composer Ken Darby (1909–1992), whose version was recorded by Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians three separate times; in 1942, 1955, and 1963. The latter 1963 stereo recording for Capitol Records became the most familiar of the poem&#x27;s musical adaptations. Christmas song-writing specialist Johnny Marks also composed a short version in 1952, titled &quot;The Night Before Christmas Song&quot;, which has been recorded multiple times. It was also arranged for choir by Lee Kjelson and Margaret Shelley Vance. The poem was also set to music by British child composer Alma Deutscher (b. 2005). In 1953, Perry Como recorded a recitation of the poem for RCA Victor with background music arranged and conducted by Mitchell Ayres. Louis Armstrong recited the poem in a March 1971 recording made only four months before his death. It was recorded at his home in Corona, Queens and released as 45rpm by Continental Records.

Jo Stafford recorded a version of &quot;&#x27;Twas The Night Before Christmas&quot; as part of her 1955 album &quot;Happy Holiday&quot;.

The first completely musical rendition, that used the text of the poem in its entirety without material additions or alterations, was the cantata &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; composed by Lucian W. Dressel in 1992 and first performed by the Webster University Orchestra, SATB Soloists, and Chorus. More recent performances of the cantata have been performed by regional orchestras and choruses in Missouri, Illinois and Colorado.

== Original copies ==

Four hand-written copies of the poem are known to exist and three are in museums, including the New-York Historical Society library. The fourth copy, written out and signed by Clement Clarke Moore as a gift to a friend in 1860, was sold by one private collector to another in December 2006. It was purchased for $280,000 by an unnamed &quot;chief executive officer of a media company&quot; who resides in New York City, according to Heritage Auctions which brokered the private sale.

==In popular culture==
The poem is read or recited in numerous Christmas films, including &quot;Prancer&quot; (1989), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989), &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; (1994), &quot;Reindeer Games&quot; (2000), and &quot;Falling for Christmas&quot; (2016). It also inspired two television specials called &quot;″Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot; made in 1974 and 1977 respectively.

&quot;&#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot; (2022) is a Hallmark Channel film about a town&#x27;s annual Christmas Eve courtroom production debating the true authorship of the poem.

<text>The Nebraska Amish, also called Old Schoolers, are a relatively small affiliation of the Amish. They are the most conservative subgroup of Amish, indicated not only by their use of technology but also by their particular style of dress. They emerged in 1881 as a conservative split from the Byler Amish, who themselves emerged as the first conservative splinter group from the Amish mainstream in 1849.

== History ==

Amish settled in the Mifflin County region of Pennsylvania – the Kishacoquillas Valley – as early as 1791, coming from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. In the 1840s there were three Amish congregations in the region with a membership of 290. In 1849 Samuel B. King, a conservative bishop who warned against adopting the use of rubber tires on buggies and who was also accused of giving sermons that were too long, was &quot;silenced&quot;, that is he was removed from his ministerial duties. One of the three districts, the &quot;lower&quot; district sided with King and split from the other two districts forming the Byler Amish as the first conservative split from the Amish mainstream in North America.

Around 1880, Bishop Yost H. Yoder from the Kishacoquillas Valley settlement led nine families from Juniata County, Pennsylvania, to Gosper County in south-central Nebraska, founding an Old Order Amish settlement there in the hope of maintaining their traditional distinct church and family life. 

Yoder went back to the Kishacoquillas Valley in Pennsylvania in 1881 to assist in the establishment of a conservative splinter group originating from the Byler Amish. Yoder eventually became the leader of the new group. Because Yoder had been living in Nebraska for some time, the group was nicknamed the &quot;Nebraska Amish&quot; by others. 

In 1933, a group called the &quot;Zook faction&quot; broke away from the Nebraska Amish over the use of projecting roof gables, and formed a separate district, holding their own worship services and having their own bishops. The Zook group split again in 1978. Though differences exist, they are almost unnoticeable to outsiders. Since the late 1970s they have split several times. Groups include the Rufus Zook group, the Chris Yoder group, and others. 

In the early 1980s several church districts of the Swartzentruber Amish in Minnesota, Tennessee, and Ohio split from the Swartzentruber church districts elsewhere because of disagreements over shunning (&quot;Bann und Meidung&quot;). This group, known as the &quot;Jeck Jeckey Leit&quot; is now affiliated with the Nebraska Amish.

== Practice and belief ==

Nebraska Amish dress the most conservatively of all Amish groups. Their dress is quite different from other Old Order groups because it is less influenced by the plain dress that the Quakers had developed earlier. Men are known for not wearing suspenders, trousers are laced up in the back instead. Men also wear white shirts, brown denim trousers and jackets and hair at shoulder length. The hats of the men are very broad brimmed. Women do not wear bonnets, wearing black kerchiefs and flat straw hats instead. Women in the Kish Valley and in Union County do not wear straw hats but wear white bonnet like prayer caps and in cold weather wear black head scarves over the bonnet. The head scarves are often monogrammed with names or initials. Many of the monograms are completed with fabric paint rather than using thread.

Concerning the use of technologies, the Nebraska Amish are about as restrictive as the Swartzentruber Amish, see table below. Like other Old Order Amish, the Nebraska Amish do not use motorized equipment or indoor plumbing. Other differences include the fact that they do not place screens on their doors or windows, men only wear white shirts, curtains are not used in homes, buggy tops must be white, men&#x27;s hair must be shoulder length, no lawn mowers are allowed and houses must not have projecting roofs.
Recently it was observed in the Kish Valley front mountain Nebraska Amish several minor changes have taken place. LED lights are now replacing kerosene lanterns on buggies and inside homes. The power tool batteries are charged using small solar panels. The retail price of white kerosene in the valley is currently at $7.999 a gallon so these changes could be economically related. Recently at Amish auctions, used stainless steel lamp reflectors were being sold as they are no longer needed with kerosene lanterns being replaced with 20 volt LED household lamps. 

Because Nebraska Amish have a relatively small number of youth, they allow dating over the line. So young people of different Nebraska Amish groups can date each other; however, when they want to marry they have to decide which of the groups they will join. The Nebraska Amish practice bundling.

== Members and congregations ==
In 1900 the Old School—i.e., the Nebraska Amish—had 2 districts with 159 members, in 1956 the original Yoder group had 70 and the Zook group 60 members. As of 2000, the Nebraska Amish had 14 church districts and 775 members and a total population of 1,744, mostly in northeastern Mifflin County. As of 2011 they had 19 church districts in 5 settlements. The main Nebraska Amish settlement is found in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, with small extensions into Centre, Huntingdon, and Union counties. There are 3 other Nebraska Amish settlements in Pennsylvania and one settlement near Andover, Ohio, just at the border to Pennsylvania, which was founded in 1992.

<text>Walter Henry Breen Jr. (September 5, 1928 – April 27, 1993) was an American numismatist, writer, and convicted child sex offender. He was known among coin collectors for writing &quot;Walter Breen&#x27;s Complete Encyclopedia of U.S. and Colonial Coins&quot;. &quot;Breen numbers&quot;, from his encyclopedia, are widely used to attribute varieties of coins. He was also known for activity in the science fiction fan community and for his writings in defense of pederasty as a NAMBLA activist. He was arrested in 1990 for child sex abuse and died in prison three years later. 

From 1964 to 1990 Breen was married to popular science fiction and fantasy author Marion Zimmer Bradley; it was later revealed that Bradley had been aware of his crimes.

==Early life==
Breen was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Walter Henry Breen Sr. and Mary Helena (Nellie) Brown Mehl. He spent the first several years of his life in Texas with his parents.

At the time they met, both of Walter&#x27;s parents were married to other people and living next door to each other in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Walter&#x27;s father changed his own name from Walter H. Green to Breen after abandoning his wife and children to run away with Walter&#x27;s mother. Later in life, Breen sometimes denied they were his birth parents and claimed to have been adopted by them as a foundling child. In reminiscences he spoke of being raised in a variety of &quot;institutional and foster settings.&quot;

The 1940 census shows young Breen living in a Catholic orphanage in West Virginia, with his (by then) divorced mother living as a housekeeper in a Catholic church rectory less than away. Walter&#x27;s father was by that time living with another woman in Chicago; for a while after their separation his mother resumed her maiden name and young Walter went by the name William Brown.

Breen strove to distinguish himself academically from a young age, attending a Catholic high school in Wheeling, West Virginia, and continued excelling academically throughout his postsecondary education. After being declared unfit for service by the United States Army Air Forces in April 1946, Breen was accepted that October with a recorded IQ of 144; following a severe beating, he was honorably discharged that December.

During his recovery, he read voluminously about rare coins and initiated correspondence with various members of the numismatics community, renewing his involvement in a hobby in which he had been actively engaged a few years earlier. Alternatively, Breen claimed that a severe head injury suffered in a World War II plane crash led to the development of his photographic memory.

He received his Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from Johns Hopkins University in 1952. He later claimed he finished four years of coursework in approximately ten months, concealing the fact that as a high-IQ teenage prodigy he had already completed two years at Georgetown University during World War II, followed by a brief stint at a small Catholic college in Texas. After graduating Phi Beta Kappa, he took a position as an auction cataloger for the New Netherland Coin Company while concurrently enrolled in pre-med courses at Columbia University, where he became a protege of the controversial psychologist and numismatist William Herbert Sheldon.

Breen had a longtime interest in studying high-IQ youth, which included taking out advertisements in the early 1960s for a projected private school for gifted children which Breen hoped to launch in New York City, a project which came to nothing in the end. William Sheldon worked closely with Breen on a number of coin-related projects in the 1950s, including the book &quot;Penny Whimsy&quot;, and although Sheldon encouraged Breen to attend medical school, he eventually distanced himself from the scientist, allegedly, per Breen in an interview, in part due to Sheldon&#x27;s professed anti-Semitism.

Breen eventually enrolled in the sociology graduate program at the University of California, Berkeley, where he claimed to have researched &quot;the Beat Generation groups on both coasts but also some of the very earliest hippies, finding out incidentally that some ideas that the bunch of us had developed in science fiction fandom had gotten into the hippie subculture and were being paraded around as their own inventions.&quot; He received his M.A. in the sociology of music from the institution in 1966.

==Writings==
===Numismatics===
In March 1951, the journal &quot;The Numismatist&quot; published his earliest numismatics writings, including &quot;How Our Coinage Became Mechanized&quot;. Two years later he completed his first book on American coins, &quot;Proof Coins Struck by the United States Mint, 1817–1901&quot;. In 1977, he released &quot;Walter Breen&#x27;s Encyclopedia of United States and Colonial Proof Coins: 1722-1977&quot;.

Breen was listed as a collaborator on William Herbert Sheldon&#x27;s seminal work on early date large cents, &quot;Penny Whimsy&quot; (1958), which was his revision of 1949&#x27;s &quot;Early American Cents&quot;.

In 1983, he released &quot;Walter Breen&#x27;s Encyclopedia of United States Half Cents 1793-1857&quot;. 

In 1998, Bruce A. Vogel edited and released &quot;Walter Breen&#x27;s Numismta: The United States Cent 1816-1857&quot;.

In 2000, Mark Borckardt edited an 800-plus page reference work of Breen&#x27;s large cent research, &quot;Walter Breen&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Early US Cents 1793-1814&quot; published by Bowers &amp; Marena.

===Other writings===
Breen also spent considerable time compiling information on the history of homosexuality and pederasty. His research, unprecedented in its extensive treatment of the history but not adhering to the standards of scholarly research, formed the basis for his 1964 book &quot;Greek Love&quot;, which he published under the pseudonym &quot;J.Z. Eglinton&quot;. Breen collaborated with Warren Johansson in researching the book. He dedicated the book to his wife, Marion Zimmer Bradley (unnamed in the dedication), who edited it. He also published a journal, &quot;The International Journal of Greek Love&quot;, under the same pseudonym.
As &quot;Eglinton&quot; Breen made an appearance and spoke at the founding convention of NAMBLA in 1978.

His other interests included dirty limericks and fortune cookies. He self-published monographs on both subjects.

==Arrests and convictions==
Breen was initially convicted of child molestation or lewd behavior in Atlantic City in 1954, resulting in a probationary sentence. In 1963–1964, allegations of further sex crimes caused within science fiction fandom a controversy known as &quot;Breendoggle&quot;; Breen was banned from attending Pacificon II and briefly blackballed from the subculture&#x27;s main amateur press association. Nevertheless, prominent fans of the era (such as John Boardman and Ted White) dismissed the allegations as hearsay and &quot;character assassination,&quot; and the scandal blew over. Shortly thereafter, Breen married Bradley, who was cognizant of his behavior but chose not to report him. A further molestation conviction may have occurred in 1964.

Breen was again arrested on child molestation charges in 1990. He accepted a plea bargain, which resulted in three years&#x27; probation.

A year later, he was charged with eight felony counts of child molestation involving a 13-year-old boy. Though diagnosed with liver cancer in 1992, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The conviction resulted in his expulsion from the ANA. He died in prison in Chino, California, on April 27, 1993.

In 2014, Breen&#x27;s daughter Moira Greyland revealed that she was one of the people who reported her father for child molestation.

==Personal life==
In addition to his employment with First Coinvestors, Inc., where he was an officer for many years, Breen was an active member of the science fiction fan community for much of his life. He wrote for fanzines, and took over editorship of the fanzine &quot;Fanac&quot; from Terry Carr and Ron Ellik.

He married science fiction writer Marion Zimmer Bradley on June 3, 1964, her 34th birthday. Together, they founded the Kingdom of the East of the Society for Creative Anachronism in 1968. They had two children 

and separated in 1979. After their separation, Breen moved to Oakland, California. Bradley remained his principal employer. They officially divorced on May 9, 1990.

He regularly wore his Phi Beta Kappa key as a zipper pull on the fly of his pants. He joined Mensa in 1958 or 1959, possibly the first American to do so.

A user of marijuana and LSD, Breen believed in reincarnation, often recounting putative past lives in Atlantis, ancient Greece, and other mythological and historical epochs.

<text>Hyperventilation is irregular breathing that occurs when the rate or tidal volume of breathing eliminates more carbon dioxide than the body can produce. This leads to hypocapnia, a reduced concentration of carbon dioxide dissolved in the blood. The body normally attempts to compensate for this homeostatically, but if this fails or is overridden, the blood pH will rise, leading to respiratory alkalosis. This increases the affinity of oxygen to hemoglobin and makes it harder for oxygen to be released into body tissues from the blood. The symptoms of respiratory alkalosis include dizziness, tingling in the lips, hands, or feet, headache, weakness, fainting, and seizures. In extreme cases, it may cause carpopedal spasms, a flapping and contraction of the hands and feet.

Factors that may induce or sustain hyperventilation include: physiological stress, anxiety or panic disorder, high altitude, head injury, stroke, respiratory disorders such as asthma, pneumonia, or hyperventilation syndrome, cardiovascular problems such as pulmonary embolisms, anemia, an incorrectly calibrated medical respirator, and adverse reactions to certain drugs. 
Hyperventilation can also be induced intentionally to achieve an altered state of consciousness such as in the choking game, during breathwork, or in an attempt to extend a breath-hold dive.

<doc id="381399" wikidata="Q80638" url="?curid=381399" title="Hydroelectricity">
<text>Hydroelectricity, or hydroelectric power, is electricity generated from hydropower (water power). Hydropower supplies 15% of the world&#x27;s electricity, almost 4,210 TWh in 2023, which is more than all other renewable sources combined and also more than nuclear power. Hydropower can provide large amounts of low-carbon electricity on demand, making it a key element for creating secure and clean electricity supply systems. A hydroelectric power station that has a dam and reservoir is a flexible source, since the amount of electricity produced can be increased or decreased in seconds or minutes in response to varying electricity demand. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, it produces no direct waste, and almost always emits considerably less greenhouse gas than fossil fuel-powered energy plants. However, when constructed in lowland rainforest areas, where part of the forest is inundated, substantial amounts of greenhouse gases may be emitted.

Construction of a hydroelectric complex can have significant environmental impact, principally in loss of arable land and population displacement. They also disrupt the natural ecology of the river involved, affecting habitats and ecosystems, and siltation and erosion patterns. While dams can ameliorate the risks of flooding, dam failure can be catastrophic.

In 2021, global installed hydropower electrical capacity reached almost 1,400 GW, the highest among all renewable energy technologies. Hydroelectricity plays a leading role in countries like Brazil, Norway and China. but there are geographical limits and environmental issues. Tidal power can be used in coastal regions.

China added 24 GW in 2022, accounting for nearly three-quarters of global hydropower capacity additions. Europe added 2 GW, the largest amount for the region since 1990. Meanwhile, globally, hydropower generation increased by 70 TWh (up 2%) in 2022 and remains the largest renewable energy source, surpassing all other technologies combined.

==History==

Hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks. In the late 18th century hydraulic power provided the energy source needed for the start of the Industrial Revolution. In the mid-1700s, French engineer Bernard Forest de Bélidor published &quot;Architecture Hydraulique&quot;, which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines, and in 1771 Richard Arkwright&#x27;s combination of water power, the water frame, and continuous production played a significant part in the development of the factory system, with modern employment practices. In the 1840s, hydraulic power networks were developed to generate and transmit hydro power to end users.

By the late 19th century, the electrical generator was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics. The growing demand arising from the Industrial Revolution would drive development as well. In 1878, the world&#x27;s first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at Cragside in Northumberland, England, by William Armstrong. It was used to power a single arc lamp in his art gallery. The old Schoelkopf Power Station No. 1, US, near Niagara Falls, began to produce electricity in 1881. The first Edison hydroelectric power station, the Vulcan Street Plant, began operating September 30, 1882, in Appleton, Wisconsin, with an output of about 12.5 kilowatts. By 1886 there were 45 hydroelectric power stations in the United States and Canada; and by 1889 there were 200 in the United States alone.
At the beginning of the 20th century, many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas. Grenoble, France held the International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism, with over one million visitors 1925. By 1920, when 40% of the power produced in the United States was hydroelectric, the Federal Power Act was enacted into law. The Act created the Federal Power Commission to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water. As the power stations became larger, their associated dams developed additional purposes, including flood control, irrigation and navigation. Federal funding became necessary for large-scale development, and federally owned corporations, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority (1933) and the Bonneville Power Administration (1937) were created. Additionally, the Bureau of Reclamation which had begun a series of western US irrigation projects in the early 20th century, was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the 1928 Hoover Dam. The United States Army Corps of Engineers was also involved in hydroelectric development, completing the Bonneville Dam in 1937 and being recognized by the Flood Control Act of 1936 as the premier federal flood control agency.

Hydroelectric power stations continued to become larger throughout the 20th century. Hydropower was referred to as &quot;white coal&quot;. Hoover Dam&#x27;s initial power station was the world&#x27;s largest hydroelectric power station in 1936; it was eclipsed by the Grand Coulee Dam in 1942. The Itaipu Dam opened in 1984 in South America as the largest, producing , but was surpassed in 2008 by the Three Gorges Dam in China at . Hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries, including Norway, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Paraguay and Brazil, with over 85% of their electricity.

==Future potential==
In 2021 the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that more efforts are needed to help limit climate change. Some countries have highly developed their hydropower potential and have very little room for growth: Switzerland produces 88% of its potential and Mexico 80%. In 2022, the IEA released a main-case forecast of 141 GW generated by hydropower over 2022–2027, which is slightly lower than deployment achieved from 2017–2022. Because environmental permitting and construction times are long, they estimate hydropower potential will remain limited, with only an additional 40 GW deemed possible in the accelerated case.

=== Modernization of existing infrastructure ===
In 2021 the IEA said that major modernisation refurbishments are required.

==Generating methods==
===Conventional (dams)===

Most hydroelectric power comes from the potential energy of dammed water driving a water turbine and generator. The power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water&#x27;s outflow. This height difference is called the head. A large pipe (the &quot;penstock&quot;) delivers water from the reservoir to the turbine.

===Pumped-storage===
This method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations. At times of low electrical demand, the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir, thus providing demand side response. When the demand becomes greater, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine. In 2021 pumped-storage schemes provided almost 85% of the world&#x27;s 190 GW of grid energy storage and improve the daily capacity factor of the generation system. Pumped storage is not an energy source, and appears as a negative number in listings.

===Run-of-the-river===
Run-of-the-river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity, so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment, and any oversupply must pass unused. A constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run-of-the-river.

===Tide===
A tidal power station makes use of the daily rise and fall of ocean water due to tides; such sources are highly predictable, and if conditions permit construction of reservoirs, can also be dispatchable to generate power during high demand periods. Less common types of hydro schemes use water&#x27;s kinetic energy or undammed sources such as undershot water wheels. Tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world.

==Sizes, types and capacities of hydroelectric facilities==
The classification of hydropower plants starts with two top-level categories:
* small hydropower plants (SHP) and
* large hydropower plants (LHP).
The classification of a plant as an SHP or LHP is primarily based on its nameplate capacity, the threshold varies by the country, but in any case a plant with the capacity of 50 MW or more is considered an LHP. As an example, for China, SHP power is below 25 MW, for India - below 15 MW, most of Europe - below 10 MW.

The SHP and LHP categories are further subdivided into many subcategories that are not mutually exclusive. For example, a low-head hydro power plant with hydrostatic head of few meters to few tens of meters can be classified either as an SHP or an LHP. The other distinction between SHP and LHP is the degree of the water flow regulation: a typical SHP primarily uses the natural water discharge with very little regulation in comparison to an LHP. Therefore, the term SHP is frequently used as a synonym for the run-of-the-river power plant.

===Large facilities===
The largest power producers in the world are hydroelectric power stations, with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current largest nuclear power stations.

Although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations, facilities from over a few hundred megawatts are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities.

Currently, only seven facilities over () are in operation worldwide, see table below.

===Small===
Small hydro is hydroelectric power on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant. The definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to 10 megawatts (MW) is generally accepted as the upper limit. This may be stretched to and in Canada and the United States.

Small hydro stations may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy. Alternatively, small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a grid, or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network. Since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work, they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro. This decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production.

===Micro===
Micro hydro means hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to of power. These installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community, or are sometimes connected to electric power networks. There are many of these installations around the world, particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel. Micro hydro systems complement photovoltaic solar energy systems because in many areas water flow, and thus available hydro power, is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum.

===Pico===
Pico hydro is hydroelectric power generation of under . It is useful in small, remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity. For example, the 1.1 kW Intermediate Technology Development Group Pico Hydro Project in Kenya supplies 57 homes with very small electric loads (e.g., a couple of lights and a phone charger, or a small TV/radio). Even smaller turbines of 200–300 W may power a few homes in a developing country with a drop of only . A Pico-hydro setup is typically run-of-the-river, meaning that dams are not used, but rather pipes divert some of the flow, drop this down a gradient, and through the turbine before returning it to the stream.

===Underground===
An underground power station is generally used at large facilities and makes use of a large natural height difference between two waterways, such as a waterfall or mountain lake. A tunnel is constructed to take water from the high reservoir to the generating hall built in a cavern near the lowest point of the water tunnel and a horizontal tailrace taking water away to the lower outlet waterway.

===Calculating available power===

A simple formula for approximating electric power production at a hydroelectric station is:

formula_1

where
* formula_2 is power (in watts)
* formula_3 (eta) is the coefficient of efficiency (a unitless, scalar coefficient, ranging from 0 for completely inefficient to 1 for completely efficient).
* formula_4 (rho) is the density of water (~1000 kg/m3)
* formula_5 is the volumetric flow rate (in m3/s)
* formula_6 is the mass flow rate (in kg/s)
* formula_7 (Delta h) is the change in height (in meters)
* formula_8 is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s2)

Efficiency is often higher (that is, closer to 1) with larger and more modern turbines. Annual electric energy production depends on the available water supply. In some installations, the water flow rate can vary by a factor of 10:1 over the course of a year.

==Properties==

===Advantages===
====Flexibility====
Hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. Hydro turbines have a start-up time of the order of a few minutes. Although battery power is quicker its capacity is tiny compared to hydro. It takes less than 10 minutes to bring most hydro units from cold start-up to full load; this is quicker than nuclear and almost all fossil fuel power. Power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation. Hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs. Instead, it can serve as backup for non-hydro generators.

====High value power====
The major advantage of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is their ability to store water at low cost for dispatch later as high value clean electricity. In 2021, the IEA estimated that the &quot;reservoirs of all existing conventional hydropower plants combined can store a total of 1,500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electrical energy in one full cycle&quot; which was &quot;about 170 times more energy than the global fleet of pumped storage hydropower plants&quot;. Battery storage capacity is not expected to overtake pumped storage during the 2020s. When used as peak power to meet demand, hydroelectricity has a higher value than baseload power and a much higher value compared to intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Hydroelectric stations have long economic lives, with some plants still in service after 50–100 years. Operating labor cost is also usually low, as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation.

Where a dam serves multiple purposes, a hydroelectric station may be added with relatively low construction cost, providing a useful revenue stream to offset the costs of dam operation. It has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the Three Gorges Dam will cover the construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation. However, some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return, unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place.

====Suitability for industrial applications====
While many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks, some are created to serve specific industrial enterprises. Dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for aluminium electrolytic plants, for example. The Grand Coulee Dam switched to support Alcoa aluminium in Bellingham, Washington, United States for American World War II airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens (in addition to aluminium power) after the war. In Suriname, the Brokopondo Reservoir was constructed to provide electricity for the Alcoa aluminium industry. New Zealand&#x27;s Manapouri Power Station was constructed to supply electricity to the aluminium smelter at Tiwai Point.

====Reduced CO2 emissions====
Since hydroelectric dams do not use fuel, power generation does not produce carbon dioxide. While carbon dioxide is initially produced during construction of the project, and some methane is given off annually by reservoirs, hydro has one of the lowest lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for electricity generation. The low greenhouse gas impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in temperate climates. Greater greenhouse gas emission impacts are found in the tropical regions because the reservoirs of power stations in tropical regions produce a larger amount of methane than those in temperate areas.

Like other non-fossil fuel sources, hydropower also has no emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or other particulates.

====Other uses of the reservoir====
Reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for water sports, and become tourist attractions themselves. In some countries, aquaculture in reservoirs is common. Multi-use dams installed for irrigation support agriculture with a relatively constant water supply. Large hydro dams can control floods, which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project. Managing dams which are also used for other purposes, such as irrigation, is complicated.

===Disadvantages===
In 2021 the IEA called for &quot;robust sustainability standards for all hydropower development with streamlined rules and regulations&quot;.

====Ecosystem damage and loss of land====
Large reservoirs associated with traditional hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams, sometimes destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests, marshland and grasslands. Damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife. The loss of land is often exacerbated by habitat fragmentation of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir.

Hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic ecosystems both upstream and downstream of the plant site. Generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment. Water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment, which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks. The turbines also will kill large portions of the fauna passing through, for instance 70% of the eel passing a turbine will perish immediately. Since turbine gates are often opened intermittently, rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed.

====Drought and water loss by evaporation====
Drought and seasonal changes in rainfall can severely limit hydropower. Water may also be lost by evaporation.

====Siltation and flow shortage====
When water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream. This has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations, particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation. Siltation can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam. Eventually, some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail.

Changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam. Lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity. The result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power. The risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of climate change. One study from the Colorado River in the United States suggest that modest climate changes, such as an increase in temperature in 2 degree Celsius resulting in a 10% decline in precipitation, might reduce river run-off by up to 40%. Brazil in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity, as increasing temperatures, lower water flow and alterations in the rainfall regime, could reduce total energy production by 7% annually by the end of the century.

====Methane emissions (from reservoirs)====


Lower positive impacts are found in the tropical regions. In lowland rainforest areas, where inundation of a part of the forest is necessary, it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants produce substantial amounts of methane. This is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an anaerobic environment and forming methane, a greenhouse gas. According to the World Commission on Dams report, where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity (less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area) and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant.

In boreal reservoirs of Canada and Northern Europe, however, greenhouse gas emissions are typically only 2% to 8% of any kind of conventional fossil-fuel thermal generation. A new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay.

====Relocation====
Another disadvantage of hydroelectric dams is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned. In 2000, the World Commission on Dams estimated that dams had physically displaced 40–80 million people worldwide.

====Failure risks====
Because large conventional dammed-hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water, a failure due to poor construction, natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure.

During Typhoon Nina in 1975 Banqiao Dam in Southern China failed when more than a year&#x27;s worth of rain fell within 24 hours (see 1975 Banqiao Dam failure). The resulting flood resulted in the deaths of 26,000 people, and another 145,000 from epidemics. Millions were left homeless.

The creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as 1963 disaster at Vajont Dam in Italy, where almost 2,000 people died.

The Malpasset Dam failure in Fréjus on the French Riviera (Côte d&#x27;Azur), southern France, collapsed on December 2, 1959, killing 423 people in the resulting flood.

Smaller dams and micro hydro facilities create less risk, but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned. For example, the small earthen embankment Kelly Barnes Dam failed in 1977, twenty years after its power station was decommissioned, causing 39 deaths.

===Comparison and interactions with other methods of power generation===

Hydroelectricity eliminates the flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion, including pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, dust, and mercury in the coal. Hydroelectricity also avoids the hazards of coal mining and the indirect health effects of coal emissions. In 2021 the IEA said that government energy policy should &quot;price in the value of the multiple public benefits provided by hydropower plants&quot;.

====Nuclear power====
Nuclear power is relatively inflexible; although it can reduce its output reasonably quickly. Since the cost of nuclear power is dominated by its high infrastructure costs, the cost per unit energy goes up significantly with low production. Because of this, nuclear power is mostly used for baseload. By way of contrast, hydroelectricity can supply peak power at much lower cost. Hydroelectricity is thus often used to complement nuclear or other sources for load following. Country examples where they are paired in a close to 50/50 share include the electric grid in Switzerland, the Electricity sector in Sweden and to a lesser extent, Ukraine and the Electricity sector in Finland.

====Wind power====
Wind power goes through predictable variation by season, but is intermittent on a daily basis. Maximum wind generation has little relationship to peak daily electricity consumption, the wind may peak at night when power is not needed or be still during the day when electrical demand is highest. Occasionally weather patterns can result in low wind for days or weeks at a time, a hydroelectric reservoir capable of storing weeks of output is useful to balance generation on the grid. Peak wind power can be offset by minimum hydropower and minimum wind can be offset with maximum hydropower. In this way the easily regulated character of hydroelectricity is used to compensate for the intermittent nature of wind power. Conversely, in some cases wind power can be used to spare water for later use in dry seasons.

An example of this is Norway&#x27;s trading with Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. Norway is 98% hydropower, while its flatland neighbors have wind power. In areas that do not have hydropower, pumped storage serves a similar role, but at a much higher cost and 20% lower efficiency.

== Hydro power by country ==



In 2022, hydro generated 4,289 TWh, 15% of total electricity and half of renewables. Of the world total, China (30%) produced the most, followed by Brazil (10%), Canada (9.2%), the United States (5.8%) and Russia (4.6%).

Paraguay produces nearly all of its electricity from hydro and exports far more than it uses. Larger plants tend to be built and operated by national governments, so most capacity (70%) is publicly owned, despite the fact that most plants (nearly 70%) are owned and operated by the private sector, as of 2021.

The following table lists these data for each country:

* total generation from hydro in terawatt-hours,
* percent of that country&#x27;s generation that was hydro,
* total hydro capacity in gigawatts,
* percent growth in hydro capacity, and
* the hydro capacity factor for that year.

Data are sourced from Ember dating to the year 2023 unless otherwise specified. Only includes countries with more than 1 TWh of generation. Links for each location go to the relevant hydro power page, when available.

<text>The history of ancient Greek coinage can be divided (along with most other Greek art forms) into four periods: the Archaic, the Classical, the Hellenistic and the Roman. The Archaic period extends from the introduction of coinage to the Greek world during the 7th century BC until the Persian Wars in about 480 BC. The Classical period then began, and lasted until the conquests of Alexander the Great in about 330 BC, which began the Hellenistic period, extending until the Roman absorption of the Greek world in the 1st century BC. The Greek cities continued to produce their own coins for several more centuries under Roman rule. The coins produced during this period are called Roman provincial coins or Greek Imperial Coins.

==Weight standards and denominations==

The three most important standards of the ancient Greek monetary system were the Attic standard, based on the Athenian drachma of of silver, the Corinthian standard based on the stater of of silver, that was subdivided into three silver drachmas of , and the Aeginetan stater or didrachm of , based on a drachma of . The word &quot;drachm(a)&quot; means &quot;a handful&quot;, literally &quot;a grasp&quot;. Drachmae were divided into six &quot;obols&quot; (from the Greek word for a spit), and six spits made a &quot;handful&quot;. This suggests that before coinage came to be used in Greece, spits in prehistoric times were used as measures in daily transactions. In archaic, pre-numismatic times iron was valued for making durable tools and weapons, and its casting in spit form may have actually represented a form of transportable bullion, which eventually became bulky and inconvenient after the adoption of precious metals. Because of this very aspect, Spartan legislation famously forbade issuance of Spartan coin, and enforced the use of iron ingots, called &quot;pelanoi&quot; in order to discourage avarice and the hoarding of wealth. In addition to its original meaning (which also gave the diminutive &quot;obelisk&quot;, &quot;little spit&quot;), the word &quot;obol&quot; (ὀβολός, &quot;obolós&quot;, or ὀβελός, &quot;obelós&quot;) was retained as a Greek word for coins of small value, still used as such in Modern Greek slang (όβολα, &quot;óvola&quot;, &quot;monies&quot;).
The obol was further subdivided into &quot;tetartemorioi&quot; (singular &quot;tetartemorion&quot;) which represented obol, or drachm. This coin (which was known to have been struck in Athens, Colophon, and several other cities) is mentioned by Aristotle as the smallest silver coin. Various multiples of this denomination were also struck, including the &quot;trihemitetartemorion&quot; (literally three half-tetartemorioi) valued at of an obol.
==Archaic period (until about 480 BC)==
The earliest known electrum coins, Lydian and East Greek coins found under the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, are currently dated to around 640 BC. These coins were issued either by the non-Greek Lydians for their own use or perhaps because Greek mercenaries wanted to be paid in precious metal at the conclusion of their time of service, and wanted to have their payments marked in a way that would authenticate them. These coins were made of electrum, an alloy of gold and silver that was highly prized and abundant in that area.

In the middle of the 6th century BC, King Croesus replaced the electrum coins with coins of pure gold and pure silver, called &quot;Croeseids&quot;. The credit for inventing pure gold and silver coinage is attributed by Herodotus to the Lydians:


The Greek world was divided into more than two thousand self-governing city-states (in Greek, &quot;poleis&quot;), and more than half of them issued their own coins. Some coins circulated widely beyond their &quot;polis&quot;, indicating that they were being used in inter-city trade; the first example appears to have been the silver stater or &quot;didrachm&quot; of Aegina that regularly turns up in hoards in Egypt and the Levant, places which were deficient in silver supply. As such coins circulated more widely, other cities began to mint coins to this &quot;Aeginetan&quot; weight standard of to the drachm, other cities included their own symbols on the coins.

Athenian coins, however, were struck on the &quot;Attic&quot; standard, with a drachm equaling of silver. Over time, Athens&#x27; plentiful supply of silver from the mines at Laurion and its increasing dominance in trade made this the pre-eminent standard. These coins, known as &quot;owls&quot; because of their central design feature, were also minted to an extremely tight standard of purity and weight. This contributed to their success as the premier trade coin of their era. Tetradrachms on this weight standard continued to be a widely used coin (often the most widely used) through the classical period. By the time of Alexander the Great and his Hellenistic successors, this large denomination was being regularly used to make large payments, or was often saved for hoarding.

;International circulation
Archaic Greek coinage seems to have had a very wide circulation in the Achaemenid Empire. Many of them were discovered in coin hoards throughout the Achaemenid Empire such as the Ghazzat hoard and the Apadana hoard, and also very far to the East, such as the Kabul hoard or the Pushkalavati hoard in Ancient India, following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley. Generally, Greek coins (both Archaic and early Classical) are comparatively very numerous in the Achaemenid coin hoards discovered in the East of the Achaemenid Empire, much more numerous than Sigloi, suggesting that the circulation of Greek coinage was central in the monetary system of those part of the Empire.
==Classical period (480–323 BC)==
The Classical period saw Greek coinage reach a high level of technical and aesthetic quality. Larger cities now produced a range of fine silver and gold coins, most bearing a portrait of their patron god or goddess or a legendary hero on one side, and a symbol of the city on the other. Some coins employed a visual pun: some coins from Rhodes featured a rose, since the Greek word for rose is &quot;rhodon&quot;. The use of inscriptions on coins also began, usually the name of the issuing city.

The wealthy cities of Sicily produced some especially fine coins. The large silver &quot;decadrachm&quot; (10-drachm) coin from Syracuse is regarded by many collectors as the finest coin produced in the ancient world, perhaps ever. Syracusan issues were rather standard in their imprints, one side bearing the head of the nymph Arethusa and the other usually a victorious quadriga. The tyrants of Syracuse were fabulously rich, and part of their public relations policy was to fund quadrigas for the Olympic chariot race, a very expensive undertaking. As they were often able to finance more than one quadriga at a time, they were frequent victors in this highly prestigious event. Syracuse was one of the epicenters of numismatic art during the classical period. Led by the engravers Kimon and Euainetos, Syracuse produced some of the finest coin designs of antiquity.

Amongst the first centers to produce coins during the Greek colonization of mainland Southern Italy (Magna Graecia) were Paestum, Crotone, Sybaris, Caulonia, Metapontum, and Taranto. These ancient cities started producing coins from 550 to 510 BC.

==Hellenistic period (323–31 BC)==

The Hellenistic period was characterized by the spread of Greek culture across a large part of the known world. Greek-speaking kingdoms were established in Egypt and Syria, and for a time also in Iran and as far east as what is now Afghanistan and northwestern India. Greek traders spread Greek coins across this vast area, and the new kingdoms soon began to produce their own coins. Because these kingdoms were much larger and wealthier than the Greek city states of the classical period, their coins tended to be more mass-produced, as well as larger, and more frequently in gold. They often lacked the aesthetic delicacy of coins of the earlier period.

Still, some of the Greco-Bactrian coins, and those of their successors in India, the Indo-Greeks, are considered the finest examples of Greek numismatic art with &quot;a nice blend of realism and idealization&quot;, including the largest coins to be minted in the Hellenistic world: the largest gold coin was minted by Eucratides (reigned 171–145 BC), the largest silver coin by the Indo-Greek king Amyntas Nikator (reigned –90 BC). The portraits &quot;show a degree of individuality never matched by the often bland depictions of their royal contemporaries further West&quot; (Roger Ling, &quot;Greece and the Hellenistic World&quot;).

The most striking new feature of Hellenistic coins was the use of portraits of living people, namely of the kings themselves. This practice had begun in Sicily, but was disapproved of by other Greeks as showing hubris (arrogance). But the kings of Ptolemaic Egypt and Seleucid Syria had no such scruples: having already awarded themselves with &quot;divine&quot; status, they issued magnificent gold coins adorned with their own portraits, with the symbols of their state on the reverse. The names of the kings were frequently inscribed on the coin as well. This established a pattern for coins which has persisted ever since: a portrait of the king, usually in profile and striking a heroic pose, on the obverse, with his name beside him, and a coat of arms or other symbol of state on the reverse.

The Hellenistic period conventionally ends with the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, although a few Hellenistic rulers are known in India until the reign of the Indo-Greek King Strato III (ruled to AD 10), who issued the last Hellenistic coinage. Many Greek communities in the eastern half of the Roman empire continued to issue their own coinages, known as Roman provincial coinages or &quot;Greek Imperials&quot; in older scholarship, until the third century AD.
==Minting==
All Greek coins were handmade, rather than machined as modern coins are. The designs for the obverse and reverse were carved into a block of bronze or possibly iron, called a die. A blank disk of gold, silver, or electrum was cast in a mold and then placed between the dies, possibly heated beforehand, whereupon the coin maker would forcefully strike the top die with a hammer, thereby impressing the designs on the metal. 

==Coins as a symbol of the city-state==
Coins of Greek city-states depicted a unique symbol or feature, an early form of emblem, also known as badge in numismatics, that represented their city and promoted the prestige of their state. Corinthian stater for example depicted pegasus the mythological winged stallion, tamed by their hero Bellerophon. Coins of Ephesus depicted the bee sacred to Artemis. Drachmas of Athens depicted the owl of Athena. Drachmas of Aegina depicted a chelone. Coins of Selinunte depicted a &quot;selinon&quot; (σέλινον, celery). Coins of Heraclea depicted Heracles. 
Coins of Gela depicted a man-headed bull, the personification of the river Gela. Coins of Rhodes depicted a &quot;rhodon&quot; (ῥόδον, rose). Coins of Knossos depicted the labyrinth or the mythical creature minotaur, a symbol of the Minoan Crete. Coins of Melos depicted a &quot;mēlon&quot; (μήλον - apple). Coins of Thebes depicted a Boeotian shield.

==Ancient Greek coins today==

Collections of ancient Greek coins are held by museums around the world, of which the collections of the British Museum, the American Numismatic Society, and the Danish National Museum are considered to be the finest. The American Numismatic Society collection comprises some 100,000 ancient Greek coins from many regions and mints, from Spain and North Africa to Afghanistan. To varying degrees, these coins are available for study by academics and researchers.

There is also an active collector market for Greek coins. Several auction houses in Europe and the United States specialize in ancient coins (including Greek) and there is also a large on-line market for such coins.

Hoards of Greek coins are still being found in Europe, Middle East, and North Africa, and some of the coins in these hoards find their way onto the market. Due to the numbers in which they were produced, the durability of the metals, and the ancient practice of burying large numbers of coins to save them, coins are an ancient art within the reach of ordinary collectors.

<doc id="381418" wikidata="Q1954577" url="?curid=381418" title="Bigger and Deffer">
<text>Bigger and Deffer (abbreviated as BAD on the album cover) is the second studio album by American rapper LL Cool J, released on May 29, 1987, by Def Jam Recordings and Columbia Records. With over two million copies sold in the United States, it remains one of LL Cool J&#x27;s best-selling releases. &quot;Bigger and Deffer&quot; dominated the summer of 1987, spending 11 weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and peaking at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It became the fourth hip hop album to receive platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

&quot;Bigger and Deffer&quot; features the hit single &quot;I&#x27;m Bad&quot;, and the first commercially successful rap ballad, &quot;I Need Love&quot;. It also contains the track &quot;Go Cut Creator Go&quot;, which paid homage to his DJ. Other tracks like &quot;Kanday&quot;, &quot;The Do Wop&quot;, &quot;My Rhyme Ain&#x27;t Done&quot;, &quot;The Breakthrough&quot;, and &quot;The Bristol Hotel&quot; were also popular with fans, and helped make the album a hip-hop classic. In 1998, the album was selected as one of &quot;The Source&quot;″s 100 Best Rap Albums. The cover photo was taken in front of Andrew Jackson High School in Queens (from which he dropped out), while standing on the hood of his Audi 5000, and the back cover was shot in his grandmother&#x27;s basement (his residence at the time). Both images were shot by Glen E. Friedman.

==Critical reception==
Robert Christgau wrote that &quot;Bigger and Deffer&quot; paled beside LL Cool J&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Radio&quot;: &quot;Like the pop-metal egotists he resembles every which way but white, J proves that there&#x27;s something worse than a middle-class adolescent who&#x27;s gotta be a big shot this instant--the same adolescent the instant he becomes a big shot. Overrated though it was, the debut had guts, spritz, musical integrity, and Rick Rubin. Breakthrough though it may be, the follow-up has a swelled head, a swollen dick, received beats, and quotes from Berry, Brown, and the Moonglows that confuse me. Could it be that the planet existed before he brought it to fruition?&quot;

<text>In international economic relations and international politics, most favoured nation (MFN) is a status or level of treatment accorded by one state to another in international trade. The term means the country which is the recipient of this treatment must nominally receive equal trade advantages as the &quot;most favoured nation&quot; by the country granting such treatment (trade advantages include low tariffs or high import quotas). In effect, a country that has been accorded MFN status may not be treated less advantageously than any other country with MFN status by the promising country.

There is a debate in legal circles whether MFN clauses in bilateral investment treaties include only substantive rules or also procedural protections. The members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) agree to accord MFN status to each other. Exceptions allow for preferential treatment of developing countries, regional free trade areas and customs unions. Together with the principle of national treatment, MFN is one of the cornerstones of WTO trade law.

&quot;Most favoured nation&quot; relationships extend &quot;reciprocal&quot; bilateral relationships following both the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and WTO norms of reciprocity and non-discrimination. In bilateral reciprocal relationships a particular privilege granted by one party only extends to other parties who reciprocate that privilege, while in a multilateral reciprocal relationship the same privilege would be extended to the group that negotiated a particular privilege. The &quot;non-discriminatory&quot; component of GATT/WTO applies a &quot;reciprocally&quot; negotiated privilege to all members of GATT/WTO without respect to their status in negotiating the privilege.

Most favoured nation status is given to an international trade partner to ensure non-discriminatory trade between all partner countries of the WTO. A country which provides MFN status to another country has to provide concessions, privileges, and immunity in trade agreements. It is the first clause in the GATT.

Under rules of WTO, a member country is not allowed to discriminate between trade partners and if a special status is granted to one trade partner, the country is required to extend it to all members of WTO. In a nutshell, MFN is a non-discriminatory trade policy as it ensures equal trading among all WTO member nations rather than exclusive trading privileges.

== History ==
The earliest form of the most favoured nation status can be found as early as the 11th century. Today&#x27;s concept of the most favoured nation status starts to appear in the 18th century, when the division of conditional and unconditional most favoured nation status also began. In the early days of international trade, &quot;most favoured nation&quot; status was usually used on a dual-party, state-to-state basis. A nation could enter into a &quot;most favoured nation&quot; treaty with another nation. In the Treaty of Madrid (1667), Spain granted England &quot;most favoured nation&quot; trading status. With the Jay Treaty in 1794, the US also granted the same to Britain. In the Joseon–United States Treaty of 1882, the Korean kingdom Joseon was compelled by the United States to give it most favored nation status.

After World War II, tariff and trade agreements were negotiated simultaneously by all interested parties through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which ultimately resulted in the World Trade Organization in 1995. The WTO requires members to grant one another &quot;most favoured nation&quot; status. A &quot;most favoured nation&quot; clause is also included in most bilateral investment treaties concluded between capital exporting and capital importing countries after World War II.

== Benefits ==
Trade experts consider MFN clauses to have the following benefits:
* Increases trade creation and decreases trade diversion. A country that grants MFN on imports will have its imports provided by the most efficient supplier if the most efficient supplier is within the group of MFN. Otherwise, that is, if the most efficient producer is outside the group of MFN and additionally, is charged higher rates of tariffs, then it is possible that trade would merely be diverted from this most efficient producer to a less efficient producer within the group of MFN (or with a tariff rate of 0). This leads to economic costs for the importing country, which can outweigh the gains from free trade.
* MFN allows smaller countries, in particular, to participate in the advantages that larger countries often grant to each other, whereas on their own, smaller countries would often not be powerful enough to negotiate such advantages by themselves. 
* Granting MFN has domestic benefits: having one set of tariffs for all countries simplifies the rules and makes them more transparent. Theoretically, if all countries in the world confer MFN status to each other, there will be no need to establish complex and administratively costly rules of origin to determine which country a product (that may contain parts from all over the world) must be attributed to for customs purposes. However, if at least one nation lies outside the MFN alliance, then customs cannot be done away with.
* MFN restrains domestic special interests from obtaining protectionist measures. For example, butter producers in country A may not be able to lobby for high tariffs on butter to prevent cheap imports from developing country B, because, as the higher tariffs would apply to every country, the interests of A&#x27;s principal ally C might get impaired.

As MFN clauses promote non-discrimination among countries, they also tend to promote the objective of free trade in general.

== Exceptions ==

GATT members recognized in principle that the &quot;most favoured nation&quot; rule should be relaxed to accommodate the needs of developing countries, and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (established in 1964) has sought to extend preferential treatment to the exports of the developing countries.

Another exception to the &quot;most favoured nation&quot; principle has been posed by regional trade blocs such as the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which have lowered or eliminated tariffs among the members while maintaining tariff walls between member nations and the rest of the world. Trade agreements usually allow for exceptions to allow for regional economic integration.

== Revocation ==
WTO rules allow any country to revoke the MFN status that it had previously accorded to another: in particular, Article 21 (National Security) allows it to do so without further explanation.

===India revokes Pakistani status (2019)===
In February 2019, following the 2019 Pulwama attack that killed over 40 CRPF personnel, India withdrew the MFN status that it had accorded to Pakistan.

===G7 revokes Russian status (2022)===
In March 2022, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the G7 countries resolved jointly to withdraw &#x27;most favoured nation&#x27; status from Russia and to impose punitive tariffs. In a statement, the group declared that &quot;Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order&quot;.

== Specific countries&#x27; policies ==
=== United States ===
=== India ===
As per the obligation under their World Trade Organization (WTO) treaties of accession, the member countries of WTO automatically extend most favoured nation (MFN) status to each other unless otherwise specified in the agreement or schedule notified to the WTO by that member country. Pursuant to that provision, India has extended MFN status for goods to most member countries of WTO.

Within the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are members of the WTO and all excepting Pakistan have extended MFN status to India, which had extended MFN status to all SAARC countries. In 2019, India revoked its MFN status towards Pakistan. So far as exception to MFN status (if any) is concerned, each member country has indicated the same services in its schedule of services commitments, as notified to the WTO.

== In contract law ==
A most favoured nation clause (also called a most favoured customer clause or most favoured licensee clause) is a contract provision in which a seller (or licensor) agrees to give the buyer (or licensee) the best terms it makes available to any other buyer (or licensee). In some contexts, the use of such clauses may become commonplace, such as when online ebook retailers contract with publishers for the supply of e-books. Use of such clauses, in some contexts, may provoke concerns about anticompetitive influences and antitrust violations, while in other contexts, the influence may be viewed as procompetitive.

One example where most favoured nation clauses may appear is in institutional investment advisory contracts, where if a certain number of conditions are met, one client may be entitled to the lowest fee offered to other clients with a substantially identical investment strategy and the same or lower level of assets under management.

The most favoured nation clause can also be included in an agreement between a state and a company or an investor. This involves the provision of special privileges and advantages although the state cannot use contractual mechanisms to avoid its MFN treatment obligations with other countries. Unlike the relationship among states where a nation accorded an MFN status cannot be treated less advantageously than another, the host nation does not breach MFN treatment if it provides different privileges to different investors. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development clarified this when it stated that &quot;a host country cannot be obliged to enter into an individual investment contract&quot; and that &quot;freedom of contract prevails over the MFN standard.&quot; This general principle, however, is not absolute.

=== European Union ===
The current EU competition law position is that MFN clauses will infringe Article 101(i) if in the individual circumstances of the case result in an appreciable adverse effect on competition in the European Union. This is likely to happen when the parties to the agreement have substantial market power.

It is recognised by EU courts and regulators that such clauses are widely used in a number of industries including most topically with online travel agents. However the regulatory tide in the EU appears to be turning against the use of these clauses. In a number of recent EU cases in the UK and Germany, MFNs have been condemned when used by companies with significant market power.

== Most favoured nation startups ==
Startups with most favoured nation (MFN) clause in agreements with their investors are called most favoured nation startups. The clause intends to protect the first investors, so the later investors do not get better terms than them. This device is promoted by American early stage accelerator, Y Combinator.

<doc id="381431" wikidata="Q39642" url="?curid=381431" title="Shenyang J-8">
<text>The Shenyang J-8 (Chinese: 歼-8; NATO reporting name: Finback) is a family of interceptor aircraft developed by the 601 Institute (Shenyang) in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). It was conceived in the early 1960s as a low-risk program based on enlarging the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21F, a version of which the PRC was producing as the Chengdu J-7. The original J-8 experienced protracted development due to disruption from the Cultural Revolution; the prototypes first flew in 1969 but the design was not finalized until 1979 with the aircraft entering service in 1980.

The J-8II/J-8B (NATO reporting name: Finback-B) was a major development of the J-8 and was essentially a new aircraft. The J-8II replaced the distinctive nose air intake with a conventional radome and side air intakes to create room for a modern fire-control radar, and used more powerful engines. The aircraft started development in 1982, and was cleared for production and service in 1988. The J-8II was the basis for all later major additions to the J-8 family.

==Development==
===J-8===
By 1964, the Chengdu J-7 was inadequate to perform long-range, high-altitude interceptions. The Chinese Aeronautical Establishment held a conference on 25 October to discuss future fighters. The 601 Institute had two proposals; a twin-engined &quot;scaled-up&quot; J-7 which became the J-8, and a higher-performing single-engined option that became the Chengdu J-9. Both options were pursued. The J-8 offered lower technical risk and received higher priority and political support; the J-9 was later cancelled in 1980. The People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) approved the operational requirements on 17 May 1965. Huang Zhiqian and Gu Songfen became, respectively, the chief and vice chief designers.

The J-8 was shared some features with the J-7, including the front-hinged single-piece cockpit canopy, landing gear design, and positioning of the ventral air brakes. The tail had two ventral fins similar in shape to the J-7&#x27;s single ventral fin. The aircraft was powered by two Liyang WP-7B afterburning turbojets. The nose intake had a small inlet cone enclosing a radar rangefinder. Two Type 30-1 (Nudelman-Rikhter NR-30) cannons were mounted under the cockpit. There were three hardpoints, one under each wing and one on the centerline under the fuselage, with a total carrying capacity of 2.5 tonnes.

The programme suffered disruptions into the 1970s. Huang was killed in an air crash in May 1965 and replaced by Wang Nanshou. Design work was completed in September and a full-size mock-up completed and reviewed by December. The Shenyang Aircraft Factory was expected to complete a prototype by the end of 1966, but Gao Fangqi – its chief engineer – died and his successor, Liu Hongzhi, was dismissed in November 1966 during the Cultural Revolution. Development was transferred to the &quot;Joint J-8 Development Command&quot; led by Wang Xin. The construction of two prototypes was slow due to being done &quot;almost clandestinely&quot;; the first, &quot;001 Red&quot; was built from August 1967 to June 1968. 001 Red was damaged during high-speed taxiing tests on 19 December 1968, and made its first successful flight on 5 July 1969 piloted by Yin Yuhuan. Shortly afterward, the programme stalled due to the disbanding of Flight Test Command and Shenyang&#x27;s Chief Design Office. The Chief Design Office was only reformed in 1979 with Gu being promoted to chief designer.

From 1969 to 1979, 001 Red and 002 Red logged a total of only 1025 flights and 663 flight hours. Flight and static testing revealed several problems, including severe buffeting at transonic and supersonic speeds, overheating of the rear fuselage at supersonic speeds, engine unreliability, and airframe weaknesses. All were eventually resolved, although it continued to suffer poor directional stability. The design was finalized on 31 December 1979.

===J-8A===
The J-8 was already recognized as obsolescent when it formally entered service on 2 March 1980. Development of the improved J-8 I (later the J-8A) began at Shenyang in February 1978. The J-8 I replaced the radar rangefinder with the SR-4 radar and the capability to fire the PL-4 air-to-air missile (AAM); both radar and missile were still in development when the aircraft&#x27;s specifications were approved by State Certification Commission on 2 March 1980. Ultimately, the PL-4 failed and the PL-2B and PL-5 were used instead. The cockpit used a two-piece canopy – as on the J-7 II – and a newer ejection seat. Each Type 30-1 cannon was replaced with a Type 23-III (Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23L).

The first prototype was completed on in May 1980 and destroyed on 25 June during its first engine run when a burst hydraulic line caused a fire in the engine bay; the J-8&#x27;s hydraulic system was subsequently reworked. The second prototype first flew on 24 April 1981. Testing was completed in November 1984, and the aircraft was cleared for production on 27 June 1985. The J-8 I also fell short of contemporary requirements and only about 100 were built before production ended in 1987.

Some were converted into the J-8 IE with the JL-7 radar from the J-7C and various avionics from the J-8 II.

===J-8B===
In 1980, Shenyang began investigating improving the J-8 by using ideas embodied by contemporary aircraft like the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23. Gu and He Wenzhi began design work on what became the J-8 II (later the J-8B) in 1982.

70% of the J-8&#x27;s airframe structure and systems were reworked. The nose air intake and its shock cone were replaced with an ogival radome and lateral air intakes to create room for the larger Type 208 pulse-Doppler radar. The number of external hardpoints increased to seven; a single Type 23-III cannon was carried. The aircraft was area ruled and the powerplants replaced by the more powerful WP-13A-II turbojets. The two ventral fins under the tail were replaced by a single larger fin copied from the MiG-23; the fin folded to starboard on the ground for ground clearance. Performance was greatly improved with the higher thrust-to-weight ratio, as was handling. Improvements to manoeuvrability were limited due to the 6.9 g limit. The prototype was completed in March 1984 and made its first flight on 12 June. Production and entry into service was approved in October 1988. The greatest problems were with the avionics, particularly the radar.

The improved J-8 IIB (or J-8B Block 02), fitted with the KLJ-1 (Type 208A) radar and avionics from the J-7C, flew in November 1989 and entered production in 1996.

===J-8C and J-8F===

The J-8 III (later the J-8C) was an attempt to upgrade the J-8 II in the early 1990s. The Israeli avionics company Elta Systems was contracted to adapt the EL/M-2034 radar for the aircraft, although ultimately the domestic Type 1471 radar was used. The prototypes flew with WP-13B engines as the intended Liyang WP-14 Kunlun turbojets were under development. The wing had four, rather than two, fences, and a detachable aerial refueling probe was fitted on the starboard side. The J-8 III was certified in 1995 but production was cancelled because the WP-14 remained unavailable.

The J-8C led to the J-8F, which started development in 1999 and first flew in 2000. The latter was equipped with the JL-10 (Type 1473) radar and WP-13B-II turbojets.

===J-8D and J-8H===
The J-8 IV (also known as the J-8 IIA, and later as the J-8D) was a J-8 II with similar avionics to the J-8 IIB and the same detachable IFR probe as the J-8 III; the IFR probe was later modified because it generated noise in the cockpit. It first flew on 21 November 1990 and entered service in 1996; it was China&#x27;s first IFR-capable fighter. The J-8 IV was used primarily by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Naval Air Force and armed with the PL-9 AAM.

The J-8D was developed into the J-8H fighter/strike aircraft. The J-8H was equipped with the KLJ-1 (Type 1492) radar; armament was the PL-11 AAM and possibly the YJ-91 anti-radiation missile. It also had four wing fences like the J-8C. Development started in 1995 and it entered service in 2002.

===Peace Pearl===
The 1986 &quot;Peace Pearl&quot; program with the United States included upgrading 50-55 J-8 IIs with US avionics, Martin-Baker ejection seats, and possible US engines for . Two aircraft were flown to the US for prototyping, and work was underway by the time of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Peace Pearl was cancelled by China in 1990; the US had permitted it to continue despite the post-Tiananmen sanctions.

== Operational history ==

On 1 April 2001, a J-8B collided with a United States Navy Lockheed EP-3E ARIES II signals intelligence aircraft 70 miles southeast of Hainan Island. The J-8B crashed and its pilot, Wang Wei, was killed after his parachute failed to open. The EP-3E was severely damaged and made an emergency landing on Hainan; all 24 crew members survived.

<text>Alain Boublil (born 5 March 1941) is a French national musical theatre lyricist and librettist, best known for his collaborations with the composer Claude-Michel Schönberg for musicals on Broadway and London&#x27;s West End. These include &quot;La Révolution Française&quot; (1973), &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1980), &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; (1989), &quot;Martin Guerre&quot; (1996), &quot;The Pirate Queen&quot; (2006), and &quot;Marguerite&quot; (2008).

==Life and career==
Boublil was born in Tunisia, to a Sephardic Jewish family. Boublil&#x27;s first musical, &quot;La Révolution Française&quot;, was the first-ever staged French rock opera. It was conceived by Boublil in 1973 after he watched the premiere of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; in New York. The composer was Claude-Michel Schönberg, with whom Boublil has since collaborated on a number of successful projects, including &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;. &quot;Les Misérables&quot; first opened in Paris in 1980.

On 8 October 1985, an English-language production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; produced by Cameron Mackintosh and directed by Trevor Nunn and John Caird premiered in London at The Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s Barbican Theatre. The show transferred to the West End&#x27;s Palace Theatre on 4 December 1985. It is the longest-running musical in West End history.

===&quot;Les Misérables&quot;===

Productions based on the Nunn/Mackintosh staging of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; have been staged all over the world, including a second French production which opened in Paris in 1991. Worldwide, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; has been seen by over 50 million people, with a total box office gross of over $1.8 billion.

===&quot;Miss Saigon&quot;===

&quot;Miss Saigon&quot; opened in London on 20 September 1989 where it played for 10 consecutive successful years at the Drury Lane Theatre. It spawned two US touring companies, a Toronto production and has been seen by more than 13.2 million people in North America for a gross of $612 million.

===Other works===
With Javier Arroyuelo and Rafael Lopez Sanchez, Boublil worked on the French translation of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; for its French premiere in 1975.

Alain and Daniel Boublil created &quot;Abbacadabra,&quot; a French children&#x27;s musical based on songs from the pop group ABBA, for French television in 1983.

&quot;Martin Guerre&quot; reached the West End in 1996 and won the 1997 Olivier Award for Best Musical. Productions on tour in the UK and the US, and Europe followed, but the show failed to repeat the success of its two predecessors.

Boublil has also written the play &quot;Le Journal d&#x27;Adam et Eve&quot;, based on two short stories by Mark Twain. It premiered in Paris in 1994 at Le Petit Montparnasse.

He has worked on the stage adaptation of Jacques Demy&#x27;s &quot;Les Demoiselles de Rochefort&quot;, together with composer Michel Legrand, that opened at Le Palais des Congrès in 2003.

Boublil and Schönberg&#x27;s &quot;The Pirate Queen&quot;—a musical about the 16th century Irish pirate, chieftain and adventuress Grace O&#x27;Malley—debuted at Chicago&#x27;s Cadillac Palace Theatre in fall 2006. It then moved to Broadway, where it closed in 2007. The musical starred Stephanie J. Block as Grace, and Hadley Fraser as Tiernan.

The musical &quot;Marguerite&quot; is by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg, and includes music by Michel Legrand and lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer. Set during World War II in occupied Paris, and inspired by the romantic novel &quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot; (by Alexandre Dumas, fils), &quot;Marguerite&quot; is about the mistress of a high-ranking German officer who attracts the love of a pianist half her age. The musical premiered on 6 May 2008 at the Royal Haymarket Theatre in London. Marguerite received its London revival at the Tabard Theatre, Chiswick in October 2012. Staged by Alex Parker Productions, the revised show had a new book by Boublil and Guy Unsworth, and a reworked score (adaptation, orchestration and arrangement) by Jude Obermüller.

He was nominated for Best Original Song at the 70th Golden Globe Awards for the song &quot;Suddenly&quot; from the 2012 film version of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

===Family===
Alain Boublil has two sons, born in 1969 and 1975, with his first wife Francoise Pourcel. He then had two more sons with his second wife Marie Zamora.

<text>Claude-Michel Schönberg (born 6 July 1944, in Vannes) is a French record producer, actor, singer, songwriter, and musical theatre composer, best known for his collaborations with lyricist Alain Boublil. Major works include &quot;La Révolution Française&quot; (1973), &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1980), &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; (1989), &quot;Martin Guerre&quot; (1996), &quot;The Pirate Queen&quot; (2006), and &quot;Marguerite&quot; (2008).

==Career==

===Early career===
Schönberg began his career as a record producer and a singer. He wrote most of the music for the French musical and rock opera &quot;La Révolution Française&quot;, France&#x27;s first rock opera, in 1973. He played the role of King Louis XVI in the show&#x27;s production that year.

In 1974 he wrote the music and the lyrics of the song &quot;Le Premier Pas&quot;, which became the number one hit in France that year, selling over one million copies. &quot;Le Premier Pas&quot; was produced by Franck Pourcel. That year he also wrote a French version of the ABBA song &quot;Waterloo&quot;, which was recorded by the group.

Schönberg then made an album in which he sang his own compositions. In 1978 he dedicated his attention to musicals when he and Alain Boublil conceived the idea for a stage musical version of Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. The original production was staged at the Palais de Sports in Paris in 1980. In 1985 and 1987 respectively, the musical opened in London and on Broadway, to acclaim in each instance. The Broadway production was nominated for twelve Tony Awards in 1987 and won eight, including Best Musical and Best Original Score.

In 1989, Schönberg and Boublil produced the London showing of the musical &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, which starred Lea Salonga and Jonathan Pryce. In its transition to Broadway, the show broke advance-ticket sales, earning $24 million before its premiere on 11 April 1991. The show was nominated for ten Tony awards, including Best Musical and Best Original Score.

In 1997 Schönberg and Boublil premiered a new musical, &quot;Martin Guerre&quot;, at the Prince Edward Theatre in London. The musical won the 1997 Olivier Award and went on to tour the UK and the United States.

===2000 to present===
In 2001, Schönberg composed his first ballet score, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. This production was performed by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Northern Ballet Theatre Company in September 2002.

Schönberg&#x27;s next project with Boublil was &quot;The Pirate Queen&quot;, a musical about the 16th-century Irish pirate, chieftain and adventuress Grace O&#x27;Malley. &quot;The Pirate Queen&quot; completed its eight-week pre-Broadway tryout at Chicago&#x27;s Cadillac Palace Theatre on 26 November 2006, and underwent further development in preparation for Broadway at the Hilton Theater in March 2007. The Broadway opening date was 5 April 2007. &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; co-lyricist Richard Maltby Jr. worked with Boublil on revisions to the book and lyrics, and Graciela Daniele worked on the musical staging.

Following a critical savaging and poor ticket sales, &quot;The Pirate Queen&quot; closed on 17 June 2007 after 85 performances and 32 previews, resulting in a loss of almost $18 million, ranking it among the largest commercial flops in Broadway history.

&quot;Les Misérables&quot; celebrated its twentieth anniversary in London on 8 October 2005. The Broadway production closed on 18 May 2003, making it the third-longest-running Broadway musical, following &quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. Schönberg oversaw the production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; that returned to Broadway for an intended six-month engagement at the Broadhurst Theatre on 9 November 2006, although it later extended its run.

Schönberg&#x27;s &quot;Marguerite&quot; includes music by Michel Legrand and lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer. Set during World War II in occupied Paris, and inspired by the romantic novel &quot;La Dame aux camélias&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, fils, &quot;Marguerite&quot; is about the mistress of a high-ranking German officer who attracts the love of a musician half her age.

In 2011, Schönberg created the musical score for the ballet &quot;Cleopatra&quot; for the Northern Ballet, based in Leeds. Choreography is by the Ballet&#x27;s artistic director David Nixon. The show toured the UK throughout 2011.

Schönberg was nominated for Best Original Song at the 70th Golden Globe Awards and in the same category at the 85th Academy Awards for the song &quot;Suddenly&quot; from the 2012 film version of &quot;Les Miserables&quot;.

==Personal life==
Schönberg was born in Vannes, France, to Hungarian Jewish parents. His father was an organ repairer and his mother was a piano tuner. He was formerly married to evening news anchor Béatrice Schönberg, with whom he has 2 children. In 2003, he married Charlotte Talbot, an English ballerina, with whom he has a daughter.

<text>Budding or blastogenesis is a type of asexual reproduction in which a new organism develops from an outgrowth or bud due to cell division at one particular site. For example, the small bulb-like projection coming out from the yeast cell is known as a bud. Since the reproduction is asexual, the newly created organism is a clone and, excepting mutations, is genetically identical to the parent organism. Organisms such as hydra use regenerative cells for reproduction in the process of budding.

In hydra, a bud develops as an outgrowth due to repeated cell division of the parent body at one specific site. These buds develop into tiny individuals and, when fully mature, detach from the parent body and become new independent individuals.

Internal budding or endodyogeny is a process of asexual reproduction, favored by parasites such as &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;. It involves an unusual process in which two daughter cells are produced inside a mother cell, which is then consumed by the offspring prior to their separation.

Endopolygeny is the division into several organisms at once by internal budding.

==Cellular reproduction==
Some cells divide asymmetrically by budding, for example &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, the yeast species used in baking and brewing. This process results in a &#x27;mother&#x27; cell and a smaller &#x27;daughter&#x27; cell. Cryo-electron tomography recently revealed that mitochondria in cells divide by budding.

==Animal reproduction==
In some multicellular animals, offspring may develop as outgrowths of the mother. Animals that reproduce by budding include corals, some sponges, some acoels (e.g., &quot;Convolutriloba&quot;), echinoderm larvae, placozoans, symbions, pterobranchians, entoproctans, some polychaetes, bryozoans, tunicates, flatworms and a single phoronid species.

==Colony division==
Colonies of some bee species have also exhibited budding behavior, such as &quot;Apis dorsata&quot;. Although budding behavior is rare in this bee species, it has been observed when a group of workers leave the natal nest and construct a new nest usually near the natal one.

==Virology==
In virology, budding is a form of viral shedding by which enveloped viruses acquire their external envelope from the host cell membrane, which bulges outwards and encloses the virion.

==Plant multiplication==
In agriculture and horticulture, buding refers to grafting the bud of one plant onto another.

<text>Larry Spencer (December 21, 1941—March 14, 2022) is a Baptist pastor in Canada, and former Member of Parliament (MP) for the Saskatchewan riding of Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre. He later served as interim national president of the Christian Heritage Party of Canada.

==Biography==
Spencer was born in Stockton, Missouri, United States, in 1942. He worked in Kansas City, Missouri, for Hallmark Cards after graduating from Sheldon High School. He left Hallmark after eight years, and in 1967 worked as a farm hand. He moved to Canada in 1974, after responding to a request to come to Saskatchewan as a church planner for the Regina, Saskatchewan, area. He established Discovery Baptist Church in Regina in 1978 and now assists at Calvary Baptist Church in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, where he now resides.

He is married to Sue Brown, whom he met in high school.

==Member of Parliament==
He was first elected as candidate of Canadian Alliance in the 2000 federal election. He was appointed family issues critic for the CA caucus, but was later suspended from the caucus for his controversial remarks. When the CA merged into the new Conservative Party of Canada, he did not join the caucus of the new party, and thus became an independent. He sought re-election in the 2004 federal election as an independent conservative, but lost.

===Views on homosexuality===
In late November 2003, Spencer caused controversy in Canada by Vancouver Sun reporter Peter O&#x27;Neil when he said that he would support any initiative to outlaw homosexuality. He stated that in the 1960s, a &quot;well-orchestrated&quot; conspiracy began and led to recent successes in the gay rights movement. This conspiracy, he further said, included seducing and recruiting young boys in playgrounds and locker rooms, and deliberately infiltrating North America&#x27;s schools, judiciaries, entertainment industries, and religious communities. According to him, this conspiracy started with a speech given by a U.S. gay rights activist in the 1960s whose name he could not remember. Spencer stated:
:His quote went something like this ... &quot;We will seduce your sons in the locker rooms, in the gymnasiums, in the hallways, in the playgrounds, and on and on, in this land.&quot; It was quite a long quote stating what was going to happen to the young boys of North America.

Spencer further blamed former Canadian prime-minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau for the &quot;movement&quot; gaining public acceptance since he legalized homosexuality in Canada in 1969. He mentioned that although no government would have the courage to strike down these laws, and that he would support any initiative that advocated such a move.

He also feared that &quot;Polygamy is next on the list. More than one [spouse] ... We&#x27;ll see that within the next very, very few years. Pedophilia is being pursued as we speak ... Some will say down to an eight-year-old, they think it&#x27;s OK.&quot;

He believed that gay people can rid themselves of homosexuality if they put their minds to it.

As a result of his comments, Spencer was stripped of his job as family issues critic by Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper on November 27, 2003. He also temporarily removed himself from the party&#x27;s caucus, and apologized &quot;completely and without reservation&quot; for his remarks.

He has written a book, &quot;&quot; telling of his experience as an MP and how he was treated by the Canadian Alliance and the Canadian press.

<text>The Secret Adversary is the second published detective fiction novel by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in January 1922 in the United Kingdom by The Bodley Head and in the United States by Dodd, Mead and Company later in that same year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $1.75.

The book introduces the characters of Tommy and Tuppence who feature in three other Christie novels and one collection of short stories; the five Tommy and Tuppence books span Agatha Christie&#x27;s writing career. They are hired for a job that leads them both to many dangerous situations, meeting allies as well, including an American millionaire in search of his cousin.

Reviews were generally positive on this adventure, which manages to keep the identity of the arch-criminal secret to the very end.

==Plot summary==
In 1920 London, demobilised soldier Tommy Beresford reunites with his childhood friend and war volunteer Prudence &quot;Tuppence&quot; Cowley. In passing, he mentions that he overheard a man mention the name &quot;Jane Finn,&quot; which he finds ridiculous. Out of work and money, they form &quot;The Young Adventurers, Ltd&quot;. 

Their first client, a Mr Whittington, makes Tuppence a suspiciously generous offer. Remembering Tommy&#x27;s anecdote, when Whittington asks Tuppence her name, she gives him the alias &quot;Jane Finn.&quot; A shocked Whittington offers her £50 hush money and asks her to return the following day, but when she returns, the office has been suddenly closed. They decide to advertise for information about &quot;Jane Finn,&quot; and receive two replies, from a Mr. Carter, and from Mr. Julius Hersheimmer.

Carter, who Tommy recognizes from his wartime service in British intelligence, tells them that Jane Finn is believed to have received a secret treaty from a British agent during the sinking of RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; in May 1915, as she was more likely to survive. According to Mr. Carter, if the terms of the treaty were disclosed, it would cause the government to fall and precipitate a general strike. Mr. Carter hires Tommy and Tuppence to find her, but Carter warns them about an enemy agent known only as &quot;Mr Brown.&quot;

They then get in touch with Julius Hersheimmer, who turns out to be an American multimillionaire, and Jane Finn&#x27;s cousin, who has come to London to find her.

Tommy and Tuppence&#x27;s investigation leads them to the home of Mrs Marguerite &quot;Rita&quot; Vandemeyer, a woman with several powerful friends, including Whittington and Sir James Peel Edgerton, K C. Under cover, Tuppence obtains a job as Mrs Vandemeyer&#x27;s maid and enlists the help of a young boy working there named Albert. Edgerton cryptically suggests that Tuppence might be better off working for someone else. This leads Tommy and Tuppence to go to Edgerton&#x27;s office to ask about the remark. When Tuppence resumes her disguise and returns to Vandemeyer&#x27;s house, Vandemeyer discovers her deception, and holds her at gunpoint, until Tuppence wrests the gun away. Tuppence offers Vandemeyer a large bribe to tell the whereabouts of Jane Finn, but she screamed and fainted after seeing Hersheimmer and Edgerton. They leave her in her bed but lock her in her room because of their fear of Mr. Brown, but when they return in the morning, Vandemeyer is found dead.

Meanwhile, Tommy follows Boris Ivanovitch, another of Rita&#x27;s associates, to a house in Soho, where Tommy is taken prisoner while attempting to eavesdrop on a meeting of Bolshevist conspirators. A young French woman at the house, Annette, arranges his escape, but refuses to leave herself. Tommy returns to the Ritz and finds Tuppence.

Sir James discovers Jane Finn, who has recovered her memory after an accident. She tells them where she hid the treaty, but they find instead a message from Mr Brown. While searching for writing paper in Julius&#x27;s drawer, Tommy finds a photograph of Annette. Tommy concludes that Annette is the real Jane Finn and the Jane Finn they met was a plant to stop their investigation. He gets an original copy of the telegram sent to Tuppence and sees that her destination was altered on the copy he read. Tommy and Albert proceed to the correct destination.

Hersheimmer arranges for the release of Tuppence and Annette. At Sir James&#x27;s residence, Jane tells her story: after receiving the packet, she became suspicious of Mrs Vandemeyer. Jane placed blank sheets in the original packet, sealing the treaty inside magazine pages. Travelling from Ireland, she was mugged and taken to the house in Soho. Perceiving the intent of her captors, Jane faked amnesia, conversing only in French. She hid the treaty in a picture frame in her room and has maintained her role as &quot;Annette&quot; ever since. Tuppence suspects that Hersheimmer is Mr Brown. Sir James agrees, adding that the real Hersheimmer was killed in America and that his imposter killed Mrs Vandemeyer. They rush to Soho, recovering the treaty at the house. Sir James identifies himself as the true Mr Brown, and announces his plan to kill them, wound himself, and then blame it on the elusive Mr Brown. Julius and Tommy, who are hiding in the room, overwhelm Sir James. He commits suicide using poison concealed in his ring, the compelling evidence to persuade Mr Carter of his old friend&#x27;s guilt.

Tommy’s role in solving the mystery persuades his estranged rich uncle to support him financially and make Tommy his heir. The novel ends with both Hersheimmer and Jane, and Tommy and Tuppence, engaged to marry.

==Literary significance and reception==
Upon publication of the first book edition it was reviewed by &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; in its edition of 26 January 1922, which described it as &quot;a whirl of thrilling adventures&quot;. It stated that the characters of Tommy and Tuppence were &quot;refreshingly original&quot; and praised the fact that the &quot;identity of the arch-criminal, the elusive &quot;Mr Brown&quot;, is cleverly concealed to the very end&quot;.

The critic for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; (11 June 1922) was also impressed: &quot;It is safe to assert that unless the reader peers into the last chapter or so of the tale, he will not know who this secret adversary is until the author chooses to reveal him.&quot; The review gave something of a backhanded compliment when it said that Christie &quot;gives a sense of plausibility to the most preposterous situations and developments.&quot; Nevertheless it conceded thatMiss Christie has a clever prattling style that shifts easily into amusing dialogue and so aids the pleasure of the reader as he tears along with Tommy and Tuppence on the trail of the mysterious Mr Brown. Many of the situations are a bit moth-eaten from frequent usage by other writers, but at that Miss Christie manages to invest them with a new sense of individuality that renders them rather absorbing.

Robert Barnard described the novel as &quot;The first and best (no extravagant compliment this) of the Tommy and Tuppence stories. It tells how the dauntless pair foils a plot to foment labour unrest and red revolution in Britain, masterminded by the man behind the Bolshevists. Good reactionary fun, if you&#x27;re in that mood.&quot;

Some additional blurbs regarding the book, and used by The Bodley Head for advertising subsequent print runs, were:
:*&quot;It&#x27;s an excellent yarn and the reader will find it as impossible as we did to put it aside until the mystery has been fathomed.&quot; — &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;

:*&quot;We promise our readers an exciting story of adventure, full of hairbreadth escapes, and many disappointments if they try to guess the riddle before the author is ready to give them the clue. — An excellent story.&quot; — &quot;Saturday Review&quot;.

:*&quot;The atmosphere of the book is admirable and the story will be read with avidity by all. Undoubtedly the book is a success.&quot; — &quot;East Anglian Daily Times&quot;.

:*&quot;A book of thrilling adventure. Sensational adventures which make thrilling and gripping reading. Mrs Christie has certainly succeeded in writing a story not only entertaining, but ingenious and amazingly clever.&quot; — &quot;Irish Independent&quot;.
==Adaptations==

===Film===

&quot;The Secret Adversary&quot; was the second Christie work to be turned into a film. Made in Germany by the &quot;Orplid Film&quot; company, it was released in that country on 15 February 1929 as &quot;Die Abenteurer G.m.b.H.&quot;, a silent movie which ran for 76 minutes. It was released in the UK and US under the title &quot;Adventures Inc.&quot; Character names from the book were changed for the film. Previously thought to be lost, it was given a rare showing at the National Film Theatre on 15 July 2001

===Television===
The novel was adapted twice for television, in 1983 and in 2014 (aired July–August 2015 in the UK).

The book was adapted by London Weekend Television as a 115-minute drama, and transmitted on Sunday, 9 October 1983. It acted as an introduction to a ten-part adaptation of &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;, made with the same stars, which began transmission one week later under the title &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Partners in Crime&quot;.

In February 2014, the BBC announced it had commissioned the TV series &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;, with three episodes as an adaptation of &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot;, written by Zinnie Harris. It aired in July/August 2015, marking the 125th anniversary of Dame Agatha Christie&#x27;s birth. It is not set in the post-Great War period, so Tommy and Tuppence are not the young things of that era, are married and have a son sent off to school. It is instead set in 1952, with references made to the Cold War against Stalin.

===Graphic novel adaptation===
&quot;The Secret Adversary&quot; was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 20 May 2008, adapted by François Rivière and illustrated by Frank Leclercq (). This was translated from the edition first published in France by Emmanuel Proust éditions in 2003 under the title of &quot;Mister Brown&quot;.

===Stage===
&quot;Agatha Christie’s The Secret Adversary&quot; was presented for the stage for the first time in 2015 as a Watermill Theatre production, adapted from the Christie novel by Sarah Punshon and Johann Hari for a company of seven actors. A play in two acts, it was described in the publicity as being &quot;shot through with fast-paced action, comedy, live music and a dash of romance&quot;. The live music was performed by the cast. Tuppence was played by Emerald O’Hanrahan, and Tommy by Garmon Rhys. It opened and ran at The Watermill Theatre, West Berkshire Playhouse from Thursday 12 February to Saturday 21 March, and then toured until Saturday 9 May, ending its run at the Rose Theatre, Kingston.

On 16 February 2016, Great Lakes Theater debuted a 70-minute stage adaptation as part of their educational programming. Adapted by David Hansen, this production is performed by a cast of five (3 men, 2 women) with most performers playing more than one role.

Like its predecessor, &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot; was first published as an unillustrated serialisation in &quot;The Times&quot; weekly edition (aka &quot;The Weekly Times&quot;) as a complete and unabridged text in seventeen instalments from 12 August (Issue 2328) to 2 December 1921 (Issue 2343). Christie was paid £50 for the serialisation rights (£1,545 in 2003 currency).

Christie&#x27;s publisher, John Lane, was not very keen of the novel, since he had wanted her to write another detective novel along the lines of &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;.

===Book dedication===
The dedication of the book reads:
&quot;&quot;To all those who lead monotonous lives in the hope that they experience at second hand the delights and dangers of adventure&quot;.&quot;

This statement was one of only two times that Christie addressed a dedication to her readers, the other occasion being the penultimate Tommy and Tuppence book, &quot;By the Pricking of My Thumbs&quot; in 1968.

===Dustjacket blurb===
The dustjacket front flap of the first edition carried no specially written blurb. Instead, it repeated the text which appeared on the jacket of &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; (the back jacket flap carrying review quotes of the earlier novel). In later editions, blurbs first published in the back of &quot;Poirot Investigates&quot; were used.

<text>The People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force, also referred to as the Chinese Air Force () or the People&#x27;s Air Force (), is an aerial service branch of the Central Military Commission. The Air Force is composed of five sub-branches: aviation, ground-based air defense, radar, Airborne Corps, and other support elements.

The PLAAF traces its origins to the establishment of a small aviation unit by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1924, during the early years of the Republic of China. This initial group comprised nine cadets who trained under the Guangzhou Revolutionary Government Aviation Bureau, with further advanced training in the Soviet Union. Despite initial resource constraints, including a lack of aircraft and airfields, the CCP&#x27;s Central Military Commission (CMC) established foundational aviation schools and, by the end of World War II, had begun significant organizational developments.

The formal establishment of the PLAAF occurred in November 1949, following the CCP&#x27;s victory in the Chinese Civil War. Early on, the PLAAF operated a mix of captured Kuomintang (KMT) and Soviet aircraft and began organizing its structure around several aviation divisions. The PLAAF first faced combat in the Korean War against the United States using primarily the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighter aircraft provided by the Soviet Union, which also assisted with the expansion of the Chinese aerospace industry. Post-Korean War, the PLAAF focused on enhancing air defense capabilities, a strategy influenced by political decisions to limit offensive operations. The 1960s brought considerable challenges due to the Sino-Soviet split, which strained resources and technical support. This period also saw the detrimental impacts of the Cultural Revolution on the PLAAF&#x27;s development and readiness. In the following decades, especially the 1980s, the PLAAF underwent significant reforms which included force reduction and reorganization aimed at modernizing its capabilities in line with advancing air power technology. These efforts were somewhat hampered by the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, which resulted in Western sanctions but eventually led to increased military collaboration with Russia in the 1990s.

Entering the 21st century, the PLAAF made substantial progress in transitioning to more modern airpower with the acquisition and development of advanced aircraft like the Sukhoi Su-27 and domestic models such as the J-10 and J-20. The strategic orientation of the PLAAF continued to evolve with a focus on expanding its operational capabilities, including the development of long-range bombers and enhancing joint operational capacity with other branches of the Chinese military.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Today&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) traces its roots back to September 1924 when a small group of nine cadets from the still-young Chinese Communist Party graduated from Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s military flight school in Guangzhou. Having only been founded three years prior in July 1921, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) formed a united front with the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) party against competing warlords in a bid to reunite a fractionalized China. The eighteen graduate pilots of the military flight school, under Sun&#x27;s Guangzhou Revolutionary Government Aviation Bureau, included nine nationalist and nine communist pilots who were sent to the Soviet Union for two years of advanced flight training under the tutelage of the more experienced Soviet Air Force. Two of the CCP&#x27;s graduates, Chang Qiankun and Wang Bi, continued to serve in the Soviet Air Force for fourteen years until, in September 1938, they returned to Dihua (now Ürümqi) as instructors. Chang and Wang would play instrumental roles in the founding of the PLAAF.

In January 1941, as intensifying clashes between CCP and KMT forces ended the united front against invading Japanese forces, and despite having neither aircraft nor airfields, the CCP&#x27;s Central Military Commission (CMC) established the Air Force Engineering School with Wang as commandant and Chang as head instructor. In May 1944, just over a year before the Japanese surrender to Allied forces, the CMC established an Aviation Section in Yan&#x27;an with Wang as its director and Chang as deputy director. Two years later in May 1946 and after the withdrawal of Japanese troops, the CMC established the Northeast Old Aviation School in Jilin. By 1949 the Aviation Section of the CMC had 560 trained personnel (125 pilots and 435 ground support specialists), purchased 435 aircraft from the Soviet Union, acquired 115 Nationalist aircraft, and operated seven military flight schools.

=== Founding ===
The first organized air unit of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army was formed in July 1949 at Beijing Nanyuan Airport (built and first operated under the Qing Dynasty) and operated American P-51 Mustangs, PT-19s, and British DH.98 Mosquitos. The squadron had acquired the Western-made aircraft once donated to the KMT for use against the Japanese, through a series of airfield captures and nationalist defections.

In March 1949, the CMC elevated its Aviation Section to the shortly-lived Aviation Bureau with Chang and Wang appointed as the bureau&#x27;s director and political commissar, respectively. On 1 October 1949, the victorious communist forces established the People&#x27;s Republic of China and, on 11 November 1949, the CMC dissolved its Aviation Section founding instead the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force. Initially manned by a variety of units from ground forces, the new PLAAF organized its headquarters (PLAAF HQ) in Beijing and organized administrative aviation divisions for each of the PLA&#x27;s six military regions, later to each be named a Military Region Air Force (MRAF). The new organization, which was not yet seen as a service separate from the army, was headed by ground force commander Liu Yalou with Xiao Hua (former ground force commander and political commissar) as the PLAAF&#x27;s first political commissar. Chang was appointed as a PLAAF deputy commander and as director of the PLAAF&#x27;s Training Department while Wang was named deputy political commissar and director of the Aeronautical Engineering Department.

In June 1950, the first PLAAF aviation unit, the 4th Composite Air Brigade () was established in Nanjing based on the 30th Army&#x27;s 90th Division and commanding the 10th, 11th and 12th Air Regiments. In the same year, the PLAAF created the 2nd and 3rd Composite Air Brigades. Although the 4th Composite Air Brigade would be renamed in 1950 to the PLAAF 4th Air Division, it would become the 1st Air Division in 1956 with the 2nd and 3rd Composite Air Brigades becoming the 2nd and 3rd Air Divisions, respectively.

In 1950, the PLAAF had fewer than 100 fighters.

=== Korean War to the Sino-Soviet Split ===
The PLAAF expanded rapidly during the Korean War. Two brigades were created in 1950, but disbanded in the early 1950s and replaced by division; both had subordinate regiments. During the war, 26 divisions and a smaller number of independent regiments and schools were created by personnel transfers from the army; the air force inherited the army&#x27;s organization and was commanded by army officers. By early 1954, there were 28 divisions, with 70 regiments, and five independent regiments operating 3000 aircraft. The Soviets provided Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 aircraft (J-2 in Chinese service), training, and support for developing the domestic aviation industry. Shenyang Aircraft Corporation built the two-seat MiG-15UTI trainer as the JJ-2, and during the war manufactured various components to maintain the Soviet-built fighters.

In 1955, the PLAAF had grown to the world&#x27;s third largest air force. By 1956 the People&#x27;s Republic was assembling licensed copies of MiG-15s and eight years later was producing both the Shenyang J-5 (MiG-17) and the Shenyang J-6 (MiG-19) under license.

The PLAAF emerged from the war as an air defense force. The main role was to support the army by achieving air superiority using fighters, radar, and ground-based weapons. This was reinforced through the 1950s and 1960s when the PLAAF&#x27;s main activities were skirmishing with the Republic of China Air Force near the Taiwan Strait, and intercepting American aircraft. The PLAAF was passive in applying offensive airpower due to the limited range of capabilities and political considerations. PLAAF was used as a deterrence due to the political culture at the time. The Chinese leadership, in many instances, would cancel offensive bombing missions to prevent escalation, affecting the decision-making autonomy of the PLAAF.

In 1960, Soviet engineers and advisors left China due to the Sino-Soviet split; although the Soviet Union granted licensed rights to MiG-15, MiG-17, MiG-19, MiG-21, Il-28, and Tu-16, China didn&#x27;t retain the technical material or machinery as the Soviet advisory withdrew. China had to reverse-engineer aircraft and missile systems to set up production lines. Internal political and economic chaos from the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward severely impacted the modernization and development of the PLAAF.

The prioritization of the missile and nuclear weapon programs also removed necessary resources from the aviation industry, which markedly declined through 1963. PLAAF as a whole stagnated, in metrics such as flight safety, pilot education, training, and strategic planning. However, flight hours recovered around 1965 as China started to support North Vietnam and was involved in the Vietnam War. Due to difficult conditions, the accident rates raised from 0.249 to 0.6 per 10,000 sorties in 1965.

Between January 1954 and 1971, 22 divisions were created for a total of 50.

===1970s to 1980s===
In the 1970s, the Culture Revolution (1966–1976) continued to damage the PLAAF readiness, leading to devastating impacts on pilot training, maintenance operation, and logistics. All PLAAF technical and maintenance schools were closed for a prolonged time, halting nearly every activity besides pilot flights. Moreover, the Chinese aviation industrial base was vandalized heavily due to the political turmoil, with many aircraft development programs stretched out, and the quality control in factories wasn&#x27;t sustained due to disruptions caused by Red Guards. Political fallouts from the Culture Revolution could still be felt by the leadership, and recovery only began in the 1980s.

PLAAF leadership recognized the importance of modern airpower and the existing weakness of the force in the late 1980s. After critical assessments, the 1985 reform led to force reduction, reorganization, and streamlining. Before the 1985 reorganization, the Air Force reportedly had four branches: air defense, ground attack, bombing, and independent air regiments. In peacetime the Air Force Directorate, under the supervision of the PLA General Staff Department, controlled the Air Force through headquarters located with, or in communication with, each of the seven military region headquarters. In war, control of the Air Force probably reverted to the regional commanders. In 1987 it was not clear how the reorganization and the incorporation of air support elements into the group armies affected air force organization. The largest Air Force organizational unit was the division, which consisted of 17,000 personnel in three regiments. A typical air defense regiment had three squadrons of three flights; each flight had three or four aircraft. The Air Force also had 220,000 air defense personnel who controlled about 100 surface-to-air missile sites and over 16,000 AA guns. In addition, it had a large number of early-warning, ground-control-intercept, and air-base radars operated by specialized troops organized into at least twenty-two independent regiments.

In the 1980s, the Air Force made serious efforts to raise the educational level and improve the training of its pilots. Superannuated pilots were retired or assigned to other duties. All new pilots were at least middle-school graduates. The time it took to train a qualified pilot capable of performing combat missions reportedly was reduced from four or five years to two years. The training emphasized raising technical and tactical skills in individual pilots and participation in combined-arms operations. Flight safety also increased.

From 1986 to 1988, each military region converted a division into a division-level transition training base (改装训练基地), which replaced training regiments in operational divisions.

In 1987 the Air Force had serious technological deficiencies — especially when compared with its principal threat, the Soviet Armed Forces — and had many needs that it could not satisfy. It needed more advanced aircraft, better avionics, electronic countermeasures equipment, more powerful aircraft weaponry, a low-altitude surface-to-air missile, and better controlled antiaircraft artillery guns. Some progress was made in aircraft design with the incorporation of Western avionics into the Chengdu J-7 and Shenyang J-8, the development of refueling capabilities for the B-6D bomber and the A-5 attack fighter, increased aircraft all-weather capabilities, and the production of the HQ-2J high-altitude surface-to-air missile and the C-601 air-to-ship missile.

Although the PLAAF received significant support from Western nations in the 1980s when China was seen as a counterweight to Soviet power, this support ended in 1989 as a result of the Chinese crackdown on the Tiananmen protests of 1989 and the later collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. After the fall of the USSR, the Russian Federation became China&#x27;s principal arms supplier, to the extent that Chinese economic growth allowed Russia to sustain its aerospace industry.

===1990s to 2000s===

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, PLAAF still remained a large yet antiqued force. As of 1995, the air force consisted of approximately 4,500 combat aircraft based on the 1950s and 1960s technologies, which were approaching the end of their service life. The overall force strategy is defensive, with the primary objectives limited to protecting cities, airbases, economic and industrial centers, and important institutions and facilities. The air fleet continued to shrink, with RAND Corporation predicting PLAAF being halved by the early 2000s. PLAAF leadership also lacked strategic options, given the severe constraints in China&#x27;s budgets, manpower, and technology at the time. The force lacked joint operation capabilities, had no combat experience since 1979, and lacked command and control infrastructure to support offensive operations beyond the Chinese borders. The Chinese aviation industrial base was inadequate and weak, and China lacked the capacity to produce modern avionics, composites, turbofan engines, and integrated systems.

Despite the difficulties, PLAAF was determined to introduce modern airpower and secure technological self-sufficiency. The air force inducted the Sukhoi Su-27, the most sophisticated fighter Soviets had at the time. The sales were approved in December 1990, with three fighters delivered to China before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. Contracts with the Soviet Union and later Russia also included manufacture license for China to build the Su-27 domestically, which helped the Chinese aviation industry to accumulate know-how and experience. Other technology transfer and license agreements were also signed between China and countries such as Russia, France, Israel, which allowed Chinese access to many state-of-the-art technologies. China and Western countries also made several attempted to modernize the aging Chinese fleet in the form of Peace Pearl program and Chengdu Super 7. However, the political fallout from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests terminated some of these efforts.

In the early 1990s, PLAAF continued to invest in domestic aircraft programs, including the J-10, the Project Sabre II, and the Sino-Pakistani FC-1. However, the concerns over the US possible intervention during Taiwan independence scenario in 1992 to 1993 pressurized PLAAF to build near-term combat capability by prioritizing procurement of foreign platforms, which led to the further induction of platforms such as Sukhoi Su-30 and S-300 PMU-1.

At the same time, PLAAF leadership advocated for more active roles in the Chinese military but was sidelined by the PLA headquarters due to concerns over political reliability and a general lack of capabilities. PLAAF continued persuasive efforts, and their plans were eventually endorsed by the PLA leadership in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 1999, PLAAF set up a combined arms training base to conduct multi-force joint operations. In 2003, PLAAF began structural reforms and reduced the number of personnel by 200,000 (85% were officials), freeing up resources for the force overhaul. The leadership was consolidated to become more operationally efficient. Three dedicated training bases were established to provide research, testing, training, and combat support. In 2004, PLAAF released the force reform concept &quot;Strategic Air Force&quot;, aiming to reconstruct the PLAAF into an integrated fighting force capable of both offensive and defensive operations in air and space. The 2004 reform included changes in doctrine, equipment, training, education, organizational structure, and strategic thinking.

By 2005, PLAAF was in the process of modernizing force composition by retiring obsolete aircraft. The antiquated Shenyang J-6 fighters were completely phased out of the service, and the more competent Chengdu J-7 and Shenyang J-8 platforms were partially retired with the remaining fleet upgraded with improved technologies. The number of second and third-generation aircraft was reduced to about 1,000 planes. Fighters of foreign and domestic origin with modern avionics and missiles began to enter the service more rapidly. From 2000 to 2004, PLAAF incorporated 95 home-built Shenyang J-11A with license, acquired 76 Sukhoi Su-30MKK and 24 Su-30MK2 from Russia with improved composite material, weapons, and avionics akin to Sukhoi Su-35, and negotiated the purchase of 38 Ilyushin Il-76 and Ilyushin Il-78 transport/tanker aircraft. To replace the antiquated Nanchang Q-5 attacker, PLAAF introduced fighter-bomber Xi&#x27;an JH-7A with precision strike capabilities. The homegrown Chengdu J-10 platform also matured into a highly capable, multirole fighter as PLAAF continued to accumulate experience in operating modern aircraft since the 1990s. By the mid-2000s, PLAAF had grown familiar with precision-guided munitions, aerial refueling, AEW&amp;C aircraft, and networked command&amp;control systems.

Several uncertainties troubled the PLAAF leadership, including China&#x27;s inability to produce advanced jet engines, the lack of bombers to conduct long-range strike missions, and the dilemma between procuring foreign designs or supporting the homegrown defense industry that could only produce less capable ones. Thus, generous resources were devoted to research and development, with every possible approach, including purchase, license, technology transfer, reverse-engineering, and intelligence gathering to absorb foreign technology and build up the domestic defense industry. New home-built airframes emerged in the late 2000s, including CAIC Z-10 attack helicopter and KJ-2000 airborne early warning &amp; control aircraft in 2003, Shenyang J-11B air superiority fighter in 2006, Shaanxi Y-9 medium airlifter and Shenyang J-15 carrier-born fighter in 2009, and Chengdu J-20 fifth-generation stealth fighter in 2010. Other crucial aviation technologies that support the airframes, such as turbofan engines, advanced aerospace materials, full authority digital engine control (FADEC), integrated avionics, missile technologies, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, saw substantial progress in this decade.

===2010s===

In the 2010s, PLAAF began to transform expeditiously and emerged as one of the significant competitors in airpower. According to the US Air Force&#x27;s National Air and Space Intelligence Center, PLAAF was projected to become one of the most capable air forces in 2020. PLAAF improved capabilities in several areas, including fighters, advanced missiles, early warning systems, and air defense systems; the force also started major reforms in training and doctrines. PLAAF leadership realized the force was insufficient to counter US intervention in the Taiwan strait confrontations, thus invested heavily in a wider range of conventional capabilities to transition the PLAAF from a large, technologically inferior force to hold advantageous positions in both quality and quantity at its own geopolitical theater.

In 2013, it was estimated that China had 400 modern fighters in the fourth-generation class, and the number of fourth-generation aircraft was projected to increase further with improvements in training and force compositions. According to a 2015 Pentagon report, PLAAF had approximately 600 modern aircraft and phased out more outdated platforms. The percentage of fourth-generation fighters raised from 30 percent in 2010 to 50 percent in 2015, projecting a majority fourth-generation force structure in the near future. The PLAAF also focused on developing long-range strike options with improved bomber platforms based on Xian H-6K, long-range cruise missiles, as well as fielding more multirole aircraft such as Shenyang J-16. In 2014, the Pentagon noted PLAAF was rapidly closing the gap in its training, equipment, and power projection capabilities with the United States.

From 2014 to 2016, PLAAF intensified its joint operation effort with the PLA Navy, building up power projection and expeditionary strike capabilities with other service branches, and engaged in joint patrol missions with PLA Navy in East and South China Sea. In 2015, PLA separated PLA Ground Force headquarters from the senior position, putting all service branches in the same echelon, thus ending the tradition of Army domination in PLA&#x27;s command structure. A joint command structure under the newly reformed theater commands was established, improving inter-service support, command and control efficiency, and cross-service warfighting capability. In 2016, PLA established People&#x27;s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force, which stripped PLAAF&#x27;s responsibilities in space and information domain, leaving the air force focused on air operations, air defense, electronic warfare, airborne early warning, and air-to-ground surface strike missions. At the same time, PLAAF actively developed one of the most sophisticated integrated air defense systems, capable of providing air defense coverage beyond the coastline and borders. In the same year, PLAAF general Ma Xiaotian announced that China was developing a new type of long-range bomber on the air force&#x27;s open day, which is later coined as the Xian H-20 stealth bomber.

After the reform, analysts noted PLAAF&#x27;s joint operation and integrated fighting capabilities were considerably improved. In March 2017, PLAAF incorporated Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter into service and formed the first combat unit in February 2018, making China the second country in the world and the first in Asia to field an operational stealth aircraft. Around the same time, PLAAF introduced PL-10 and PL-15 missiles to noticeably improved the PLAAF&#x27;s air combat capability. By 2019, aviation researchers believed that Chinese weapon platforms have reached approximate parity with Western equivalents, and surpassed Russia in most aspects of aviation technology development and implementation. In 2019 and 2020, PLAAF began to reform its pilot curriculum and transitional training programs, inducting advanced jet trainers and active-service fighters at dedicated training academies, ending the traditional practice of training pilot at operational units. The measure improved training efficiency and prevented distraction to the defense responsibilities of the active units.

According to International Institute for Strategic Studies, PLAAF had an unprecedented military build-up between 2016 and 2022. The force successfully closed the gap with the West due to improved domestic production, introducing indigenously developed airframes, composite materials, turbofan engines, advanced avionics, and weapon systems. In six years, PLAAF incorporated over 600 fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft in more than 19 frontline combat brigades. The modern Chengdu J-10C, Shenyang J-16, and Chengdu J-20 are all equipped with AESA radar systems, domestic WS-10 engines, standoff weapons, and long-range air-to-air missiles. PLAAF also made substantial progress with larger aircraft design and production in the form of Xian Y-20 and WS-20 engines. In 2021, PLAAF announced the force had achieved the status of &quot;Strategic Air Force&quot;. Though the self-claimed designation wasn&#x27;t universally agreed upon, many analysts acknowledged the rapid modernization progress. According to the Air University assessment in 2022, PLAAF was adjudged a strategic air force with the capabilities of long-distance power projection, maintaining combat readiness, and conducting global operations to protect Chinese interests. In 2023, PLAAF planned to decommission all older Chengdu J-7 and Shenyang J-8 platforms, which completed the PLAAF&#x27;s transition to an air fleet composed of only fourth-generation and fifth-generation combat aircraft.

==Personnel==
===Ranks and insignia===

The ranks in the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force are similar to those of the Chinese Army, formally known as the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Ground Force, except that those of the PLA Air Force are prefixed by . See Ranks of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army or the article on an individual rank for details on the evolution of rank and insignia in the PLAAF. This article primarily covers the existing ranks and insignia.

The markings of the PLAAF are a red star in front of a red band, very similar to the insignia of the Russian Air Force. The Red star contains the Chinese characters for eight and one, representing August 1, 1927, the date of the formation of the PLA. PLAAF aircraft carry these markings on the fins as well.

== Structure ==
=== Headquarters ===
The highest leadership organization is PLAAF Headquarters (PLAAF HQ). PLAAF HQ&#x27;s peacetime responsibilities are force generation, modernization, and operational control of some units like the Airborne Corps and the 34th Air Transport Division. PLAAF HQ contains four first-level departments: the Staff (formerly Headquarters), Political Work (formerly Political), Logistics, and Equipment Department.

The Staff Department () manages the PLAAF organizational structure, personnel management, intelligence, communications, air traffic control, weather support, development of air force military theory, and air force education and safety. The Staff Department is led by the chief of staff who is the &quot;principal organizer and coordinator of military operations.&quot; The Staff Department&#x27;s chief of staff has a number of deputy chiefs of staff. Previously known as the Headquarters Department, the post-2016 Staff Department maintains a number of subordinate bureaus () including the Operations Bureau, Information and Communications Bureau, Training Bureau, Ground-based Air Defense Bureau, Air Traffic Control Bureau, Pilot Recruitment Bureau, Flight Safety Bureau, Test Flight Bureau, Aviation Bureau, Confidential Bureau, Unit Management Bureau, and Planning and Organization Bureau.

The Political Work Department (), sometimes abbreviated PWD, is responsible for managing propaganda, security, political education, personnel records, civil-military relations, party discipline, party organizations within the PLAAF, and cultural activities to include song and dance troupes or public events. The Political Work Department is led by a director () and at least two deputy directors (). Subordinate to the department include bureaus such as a Cadre Bureau, Propaganda Bureau, and a Soldier and Civilian Personnel Bureau.

The Logistics Department (, led by a director and political commissar, oversee the PLAAF&#x27;s logistics to include transportation, materials, supplies, finance, medical care, and petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL). Since the 2016 reform, subordinate bureaus include a Finance Bureau, Transport and Delivery Bureau, Procurement and Supply Bureau, Air Force National Defense Engineering Development Command Bureau, Real Estate Management Bureau, Ordnance General-use Equipment Bureau, Military Facilities Construction Bureau, Combat Service Planning Bureau, Materials Bureau, and Audit Bureau.

The Equipment Department (), originally the Air Force Engineering Department, manages the PLAAF&#x27;s cradle-to-death lifecycle including repair and maintenance of the branch&#x27;s weapons systems and instruments. Led by a director and political commissar, the department leads bureaus to include the Comprehensive Planning Bureau, Airfield Support Bureau, Scientific Research and Procurement Bureau, Major Type/Model Bureau, Project Management Bureau, Equipment Purchasing Bureau, Testing and Inspection Bureau, Armament General-use Equipment Bureau, Flight Safety Bureau, and Aviation Equipment Bureau.

=== Commands ===
Below PLAAF HQ are five Theater Command Air Forces (TCAF), successors of Military Region Air Forces (MRAFs) prior to 2016. Each TCAF has seven to ten brigades. Each brigade has three to six fighter groups totaling 30-50 air craft.

Before 2003, MRAF had subordinate air corps and Bases which exercised direct control over units in their area of responsibility (AOR); MRAF only directly controlled fighter and ground attack divisions in the same province as MRAF headquarters (MRAF HQ). From 2004, leadership of units was consolidated in MRAF HQ, with air corps and Bases downgraded to command posts that acted on behalf of MRAF HQ. From 2012 onwards, the command posts were mostly replaced by Bases that exercised command and control over units (brigades) in their AOR and conducted joint exercises.

The first divisions in the 1950s was organized into a HQ and two or three regiments. In 1953, this was standardized to three regiments per division, including one training regiment. Regiments had three or four flight groups, each in turn made of three or four squadrons. Between 1964 and 1970, regiments were called groups. In the late 1980s, operational squadrons lost their training regiments. By 2010, many divisions had only two regiments. In 2019, the bomber, transport, and specialized divisions had not been reorganized into brigades and remained under the control of PLAAF HQ and TCAF headquarters.

Beginning in 2011, and in a similar process as the PLAGF, the PLAAF dissolved the majority of its air division headquarters changing previously subordinate air regiments to brigades and subordinating them directly under military region (now theater command) air forces. Brigades contain several subordinate flight groups; a flight group has one type of aircraft. All fighter and ground attack divisions and regiments were reorganized into air force brigades, organized into a brigade HQ and the flight groups organized under it.

Everything from battalions to squads are considered subunits ().

=== Airbases ===
The PLAAF has over 150 air bases distributed across each theater command.

===Aerobatic display team===
The August 1st (aerobatic team) is the first PLAAF aerobatics team. It was formed in 1962. Aircraft inventory of PLAAF August Aerobatic Team includes the J-10 and it has previously flown the J-5 and J-7. The Sky Wing and Red Falcon air demonstration teams, which operate Nanchang CJ-6 and Hongdu JL-8 respectively, were established in 2011.

== Equipment ==
The People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force operates a large and varied fleet of some 4,000 aircraft, of which around 2,566 are combat aircraft (fighter, attack, and bombers). According to FlightGlobal, China has the second-largest active combat aircraft fleet and the third-largest total aircraft fleet in the world. In 2023, the PLANAF transferred the majority of its fixed-wing combat aircraft to the PLAAF, with the intent of simplifying logistics and focusing on carrier-based planes.

According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, PLAAF combat pilots acquire an average of 100-150 flying hours annually. For a list of aircraft no longer flown by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force, see; List of historic aircraft of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force. For aircraft and equipment of the Airborne Corps, see People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force Airborne Corps#Equipment.

According to the Department of the Air Force&#x27;s China Aerospace Studies Institute (CASI) the PLAAF has a long history of developing UAVs, and continues to work on their development.

===Current inventory===





===Air defense===
The People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force operates a multi-layered, integrated air defense system combining radar stations, electronic warfare systems, early warning and surveillance zones, and air-missile defense systems of various ranges.

Chinese air defense systems are highly distributed and mobile, in order to improve survivability against SEAD missions.

<text>A kurultai (, ), also called a qurultai, was a political and military council of ancient Mongol and Turkic chiefs and khans.

==Etymology==
The root of the term is from the hypothetical Proto-Mongolic verb *&quot;kura-&quot;, *&quot;kurija-&quot; &#x27;to collect, to gather&#x27; whence &quot;khural&quot; &#x27;meeting, assembly&#x27; in Mongolic languages. From this same root arises the Mongolian word &#x27;feast&#x27;, which originally referred to large festive gatherings on the steppe, but it is now used mainly in the sense of &#x27;wedding&#x27;. However, according to the , the oldest recorded pre-Ghengizid mention of the root word &quot;Qur&quot; is found in &quot;Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk&quot;, where it was used as a verb meaning &#x27;to assemble, to assemble into a formation, to build&#x27;.

All Great Khans of the Mongol Empire, for example Genghis Khan and Ögedei Khan, were formally elected in a &quot;Kurultai&quot;; khans of subordinate Mongol states, such as the Golden Horde, were elected by a similar regional Kurultai.

During the Kurultai, Mongol Chiefs would convene to choose the next Great Khan. The Kurultai was often, but not always, held in the capital of the Mongolian empire. They were also a time to assign all critical positions of leadership, as well as an opportunity to decide the militaristic direction to be implemented under the new Khan and aforementioned new leadership.

After the new khan has been elected, an elaborate enthronement procedure followed. Johann Schiltberger, a 15th-century German traveler, described the installation of a new Golden Horde khan as follows
(quoted in):
Kurultai were imperial and tribal assemblies convened to determine, strategize and analyze military campaigns and assign individuals to leadership positions and titles. Genghis Khan was declared Khan in the Kurultai of 1206 CE. Most of the major military campaigns were first planned out at assemblies such as this and there were minor and less significant Kurultai under the Mongol Empire under political subordinate leaders and generals.

The Kurultai, however, required the presence of the senior members of the tribes participating, who were also military leaders. Thus, the deaths of Ögedei and Möngke in 1241 CE and 1259 CE, respectively, necessitated the withdrawal of Mongol leaders (and troops) from the outskirts of Vienna and Venice (in 1241) and from Syria (in 1259), hamstringing military operations against the Austrians and Mamluks that might otherwise have continued.

Although the Kurultai was a serious political event in the Mongol world, it was also a festival of sorts including great feasting and various traditional games. Many of these traditions have been carried on in the modern-day Mongolian event Naadam, which includes Mongolian wrestling, horse racing and archery competitions.

==Modern usage==
===Politics===
Various modern Mongol and Turkic peoples use it in the political or administrative sense, as a synonym for parliament, congress, conference, council, assembly, convention, gathering. Examples are: (), the World Qoroltai of the Bashkirs, Qurultay of the Crimean Tatar People, the National Kurultai of Kazakhstan, the People&#x27;s Kurultai of Kyrgyzstan, the State Great Khural of Mongolia, the State Assembly — Kurultai of Bashkortostan, the People&#x27;s Khural of Buryatia, El Kurultai of Altai Republic and Kurultáj held today in Hungary.

===Language===
In Mongolian, the following forms of the word are still in use today: &quot;khuraldai&quot;, &quot;khuraldaan&quot; and &quot;khural&quot;. &quot;Ulsin Deed Shuukhiin Khuraldaan&quot; means &quot;session of the National Supreme Court&quot;.

Other spellings include: &quot;kurultay&quot;, &quot;qurultay&quot;, &quot;qurıltai&quot;, &quot;qorıltay&quot;, and &quot;qoroltay&quot;.

The word has several modern usages in the modern Turkish language as well, e.g. &quot;Yükseköğretim Kurulu&quot; &quot;Higher Education Council&quot;, &quot;genel kurul toplantısı&quot; &quot;general board meeting&quot;. &quot;Kurultay&quot; is also a commonly-used word in modern Turkish meaning &quot;general assembly&quot;, such as for organisations, committees etc. &quot;Kurmak&quot; is also a verb in Turkish meaning &quot;to set up, assemble, put together&quot;. It is also used for &quot;extraordinary conventions&quot; () of political parties.

<doc id="381447" wikidata="Q175157" url="?curid=381447" title="One Day International">
<text>One Day International (ODI) is a format of cricket, played between two teams with international status, in which each team faces a fixed number of fifty overs, with the game lasting up to 7 hours. The Cricket World Cup, generally held every four years, is played in this format. They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A, limited-overs competition.

The international one-day game is a late-twentieth-century development. The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. When the first three days of the third Test were washed out officials decided to abandon the match and, instead, play a one-off one day game consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side. Australia won the game by 5 wickets. ODIs were played in white-coloured kits with a red-coloured ball.

In the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket competition, and it introduced many of the features of One Day International cricket that are now commonplace, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. This led not only to Packer&#x27;s Channel 9 getting the TV rights to cricket in Australia but also led to players worldwide being paid to play, and becoming international professionals, no longer needing jobs outside cricket. Matches played with coloured kits and a white ball became more commonplace over time, and the use of white flannels and a red ball in ODIs ended in 2001.

The International Cricket Council (ICC), international cricket&#x27;s governing body, maintains the ICC ODI Rankings for teams (see table on the right), batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders.

==Rules==
In the main the laws of cricket apply, but with each team batting for a fixed number of overs. In the early days of ODI cricket the number of overs varied from 40 to 60 overs per side (or 35 to 40 eight-ball overs), but it has been uniformly fixed at 50 overs since the mid-1990s.

Simply stated, the game works as follows:

*An ODI is contested by two teams of 11 players each.
*The Captain of the side winning the toss chooses to either bat or bowl (field) first.
*The team batting first sets the target score in a single innings. The innings lasts until the batting side is &quot;all out&quot; (i.e., 10 of the 11 batting players are &quot;out&quot;) or all of the first side&#x27;s allotted overs are completed.
*Each bowler is restricted to bowling a maximum of 10 overs (fewer in the case of rain-reduced matches and in any event generally no more than one fifth or 20% of the total overs per innings). Therefore, each team must comprise at least five competent bowlers (either dedicated bowlers or all-rounders).
*The team batting second tries to score more than the target score in order to win the match. Similarly, the side bowling second tries to bowl out the second team or make them exhaust their overs before they reach the target score in order to win.
*If the number of runs scored by both teams is equal when the second team loses all its wickets or exhausts all its overs, then the game is declared a &quot;tie&quot; (regardless of the number of wickets lost by either team).

Where a number of overs are lost, for example, due to inclement weather conditions, then the total number of overs may be reduced. In the early days of ODI cricket, the team with the better run rate won (see Average Run Rate method), but this favoured the second team. For the 1992 World Cup, an alternative method was used of simply omitting the first team&#x27;s worst overs (see Most Productive Overs method) but that favoured the first team. Since the late 1990s, the target or result has usually been determined by the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method (DLS, formerly known as the Duckworth–Lewis method), which is a method with statistical approach. It takes into consideration the fact that the wickets in hand plays a crucial role in pacing the run-rate and that a team with more wickets in hand can play way more aggressively than the team with fewer wickets in hand. When insufficient overs are played (usually 20 overs) to apply the DLS, a match is declared no result. Important one-day matches particularly in the latter stages of major tournaments, may have two days set aside, such that a result can be achieved on the &quot;reserve day&quot; if the first day is washed out—either by playing a new game, or by resuming the match which was rain-interrupted.

Because the game uses a white ball instead of the red ball used in first-class cricket, the ball can become discolored and hard to see as the innings progresses, so the ICC has used various rules to help keep the ball playable. Most recently, ICC has made the use of two new balls (one from each end), the same strategy that was used in the 1992 and 1996 World Cups so that each ball is used for only 25 overs. Previously, in October 2007, the ICC sanctioned that after the 34th over, the ball would be replaced with a cleaned previously used ball. Before October 2007 (except 1992 and 1996 World Cups), only one ball would be used during an innings of an ODI and it was up to the umpire to decide whether to change the ball.

===Fielding restrictions and powerplays===
The bowling side is subjected to fielding restrictions during an ODI, in order to prevent teams from setting wholly defensive fields. Fielding restrictions dictate the maximum number of fielders allowed to be outside the thirty-yard circle.

Under current ODI rules, there are three levels of fielding restrictions:
* In the first 10 overs of an innings (the &quot;mandatory powerplay&quot;), the fielding team may have at most two fielders outside the 30-yard circle. This allows only attacking fields to be set during the powerplay.
* Between 11 and 40 overs four fielders will be allowed to field outside the 30-yard circle. Either an Attacking or Normal Field can be set in the second powerplay.
* In the final 10 overs five fielders will be allowed to field outside the 30-yard circle. All three types of fields (attacking, defensive and normal fields) Can be used in the third powerplay.
The three powerplays are referenced by P1, P2 and P3 respectively, usually displayed near the score in modern scorecards.

====History====
Fielding restrictions were first introduced in the Australian 1980–81 season. By 1992, only two fielders were allowed outside the circle in the first fifteen overs, then five fielders allowed outside the circle for the remaining overs. This was shortened to ten overs in 2005, and two five-over powerplays were introduced, with the bowling team and batting team having discretion over the timing for one-one each. In 2008, the batting team was given discretion for the timing of one of the two powerplays. In 2011, the teams were restricted to completing the discretionary powerplays between the 16th and 40th overs; previously, the powerplays could take place at any time between the 11th and 50th overs. Finally, in 2012, the bowling powerplay was abandoned, and the number of fielders allowed outside the 30-yard circle during non-powerplay overs was reduced from five to four.

===Trial regulations===
The trial regulations also introduced a substitution rule that allowed the introduction of a replacement player at any stage in the match and until he was called up to play he assumed the role of 12th man. Teams nominated their replacement player, called a &quot;Supersub&quot;, before the toss. The Supersub could bat, bowl, field or keep wicket once a player was replaced; the replaced player took over the role of 12th man. Over the six months it was in operation, it became very clear that the Supersub was of far more benefit to the side that won the toss, unbalancing the game. Several international captains reached &quot;gentleman&#x27;s agreements&quot; to discontinue this rule late in 2005. They continued to name Supersubs, as required but they did not field them by simply using them as a normal 12th man. On 15 February 2006, the ICC announced their intention to discontinue the Supersub rule on 21 March 2006. Two balls were trialed in ODI for two years but it was rejected.

==Teams with ODI status==
The International Cricket Council (ICC) determines which teams have ODI status (meaning that any match played between two such teams under standard one-day rules is classified as an ODI).

===Permanent ODI status===

The twelve Test-playing nations (which are also the twelve full members of the ICC) have permanent ODI status. The nations are listed below with the date of each nation&#x27;s ODI debut after gaining full ODI status shown in brackets (Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Ireland, and Afghanistan were ICC associate members at the times of their ODI debuts):
# (5 January 1971)
# (5 January 1971)
# (11 February 1973)
# (11 February 1973)
# (5 September 1973)
# (13 July 1974)
# (13 February 1982)
# (10 November 1991)
# (25 October 1992)
# (10 October 1997)
# (5 December 2017)
# (5 December 2017)

===Temporary ODI status===
Between 2005 and 2017, the ICC granted temporary ODI status to six other teams (known as Associate members). In 2017, this was changed to four teams, following the promotion of Afghanistan and Ireland to Test status (and permanent ODI status). The ICC had previously decided to limit ODI status to 16 teams. Teams earn this temporary status for a period of four years based on their performance in the ICC World Cup Qualifier, which is the final event of the ICC World Cricket League. In 2019, ICC increased the number of teams holding Temporary ODI status to eight.
The following eight teams currently have this status (the dates listed in brackets are of their first ODI match after gaining temporary ODI status):
* (from 27 June 2006, until the 2026 Cricket World Cup Qualifier)
* (from 1 February 2014, until the 2026 Cricket World Cup Qualifier)
* (from 1 August 2018, until the 2026 Cricket World Cup Qualifier)
* (from 1 August 2018, until the 2026 Cricket World Cup Qualifier)
* (from 27 April 2019, until the 2026 Cricket World Cup Qualifier)
* (from 27 April 2019, until the 2026 Cricket World Cup Qualifier)
* (from 27 April 2019, until the 2026 Cricket World Cup Qualifier)
* (from 27 March 2023, until the 2026 Cricket World Cup Qualifier)

Additionally, eight teams have previously held this temporary ODI status before either being promoted to Test Status or relegated after under-performing at the World Cup Qualifier:
* (from 10 October 1997, until 30 January 2014)
* (from 16 May 2006, until 28 January 2014)
* (from 17 May 2006, until 8 April 2009)
* (from 13 June 2006, until 21 May 2017)
* (from 4 July 2006, until 28 January 2014)
* (from 19 April 2009, until 14 June 2017)
* (from 1 May 2014, until 17 March 2018)
* (from 8 November 2014, until 5 April 2023)

The ICC occasionally granted associate members permanent ODI status without granting them full membership and Test status. This was originally introduced to allow the best associate members to gain regular experience in internationals before making the step up to full membership. First Bangladesh and then Kenya received this status. Bangladesh have since made the step up to Test status and full membership; but as a result of disputes and poor performances, Kenya&#x27;s ODI status was reduced to temporary in 2005, meaning that it had to perform well at World Cup Qualifiers to keep ODI status. Kenya lost ODI status after finishing in fifth place at the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier event.

===Special ODI status===
The ICC can also grant special ODI status to all matches within certain high-profile tournaments, with the result being that the following countries have also participated in full ODIs, with some later gaining temporary or permanent ODI status also fitting into this category:
* (1975 World Cup)
* (1975 World Cup, 1979 World Cup)
* (1979 World Cup, 2003 World Cup, 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier Play-off)
* (1983 World Cup, 1987 World Cup, 1992 World Cup)
* (1986 Asia Cup, 1988 Asia Cup, 1990 Austral-Asia Cup, 1990 Asia Cup, 1995 Asia Cup, 1997 Asia Cup)
* (1994 Austral-Asia Cup, 1996 World Cup, 2004 Asia Cup and 2008 Asia Cup)
* (1996 World Cup, 1996 Sameer Cup)
* (1996 World Cup, 2002 ICC Champions Trophy and 2003 World Cup)
* (1999 World Cup)
* (2003 World Cup)
* (2004 Asia Cup, 2008 Asia Cup and 2018 Asia Cup)
* (2004 ICC Champions Trophy)
* (2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier Play-off)

Finally, since 2005, three composite teams have played matches with full ODI status. These matches were:
*The World Cricket Tsunami Appeal, a one-off match between the Asian Cricket Council XI vs ICC World XI in the 2004/05 season.
*The Afro-Asia Cup, two three-ODI series played in 2005 and 2007 Afro-Asia Cup between the Asian Cricket Council XI and the African XI.
*The ICC Super Series, a three-ODI series played between the ICC World XI and the then-top-ranked Australian cricket team in the 2005/06 season.

<doc id="381451" wikidata="Q1255696" url="?curid=381451" title="Tommy and Tuppence">
<text>Tommy and Tuppence are two fictional detectives, recurring characters in the work of Agatha Christie. Their full names are Thomas Beresford and his wife Prudence (née Cowley).
Tommy and Tuppence first appeared in Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot; (1922). They started out their career in search of adventure and money, and the detecting life soon proved profitable and very exciting.

==Books==
* &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot; (1922 novel)
*&quot;Partners in Crime&quot; (1929 short story collection)
*&quot;N or M?&quot; (1941 novel)
*&quot;By the Pricking of My Thumbs&quot; (1968 novel)
*&quot;Postern of Fate&quot; (1973 novel)

==Characters==
Tuppence appears as a charismatic, impulsive, and intuitive person while Tommy is less imaginative and less likely to be diverted from the truth (as their first adversary sums him up: &quot;he is not clever, but it is hard to blind his eyes to the facts&quot;) which is why they are shown to make a good team. It is in the first book &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot; that they meet up after the war (World War I), and come to realise that, although they have been friends for most of their lives, they have now fallen in love with each other.

Unlike many other recurring detective characters, including the better known Christie detectives, Tommy and Tuppence aged in time with the real world, being in their early twenties in &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot; and in their seventies in &quot;Postern of Fate&quot;. In their early appearances, they are portrayed as typical young people of the 1920s, and the stories and settings have a more pronounced period-specific flavor than other stories featuring more popular Christie characters. As they age, they are revealed to have raised three children – twins Deborah and Derek and an adopted daughter, Betty. Throughout the series they employ a man named Albert, who first appears as a lift boy who helps them in &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot;, their hapless assistant at a private detective agency in &quot;Partners in Crime,&quot; and subsequently, as a now married pub owner, renders vital assistance to the pair in &quot;N or M?.&quot; By &quot;Postern of Fate&quot; he has become the Beresfords&#x27; butler and has now been widowed. In &quot;Postern of Fate&quot; the Beresfords also own a small dog named Hannibal.

==Biography==
Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Beresford is introduced as a young redheaded Englishman who fought in the Great War, wounded twice. Prudence L. &quot;Tuppence&quot; Cowley is introduced as a young woman with black bobbed hair. She is one of several children of a conservative archdeacon, and served in the Voluntary Aid Detachment during the Great War.

With the Great War over, jobs are scarce and both characters are unemployed. They are childhood friends and reunite after the war. They agree to start their own business as The Young Adventurers. They are soon hired by Mr Carter, a British intelligence leader. They are asked to search for Jane Finn, a survivor of ″s sinking who disappeared along with documents of a secret treaty. 

Following the successful conclusion of their first case, Tommy is chosen as the heir of a rich uncle. Having fallen in love during the case, Tommy and Tuppence are engaged to marry.

Their second recorded case has them hired by Mr Carter again, on behalf of a government intelligence agency. They are placed as the new owners of the International Detective Agency, a recently cleaned-out spy stronghold. Their real mission is to intercept enemy messages, but in the meantime they handle their agency&#x27;s cases. 

The two successfully apprehend No. 16, a Soviet spy, and then decide to give up the agency. At that point, Tuppence reveals to Tommy that she is pregnant.

Their third recorded case takes place during World War II, and the couple has reached their middle age. They had retired from British intelligence long ago, and they were feeling sidelined. They are recruited by British intelligence again, to hunt German spies and fifth columnists. Their years out of service mean that they are unknown to traitors within British intelligence.

Their fourth case takes place when the two are a mature couple. Tommy&#x27;s aunt Ada dies in the retirement home Sunny Ridge, and Ada&#x27;s acquaintance Mrs Lancaster disappears soon afterwards. Tuppence is determined to locate the missing woman, and in the process learns of an unsolved series of child murders. Tuppence slowly realizes that she may be the killer&#x27;s next victim.

Their fifth and last case takes place when the couple are elderly and at least in their 70s. They have reached their retirement years, and purchase an old house in a quiet village in order to live out their retirement in peace. But an old book within the house contains a coded message, concerning the &quot;unnatural&quot; death of Mary Jordan. The elderly couple decide to investigate a cold case.

==Adaptations==
In 1953 the BBC adapted &quot;Partners in Crime&quot; as a radio series starring Richard Attenborough and Sheila Sim.

The Tommy and Tuppence characters have been portrayed on television by James Warwick and Francesca Annis, first in the feature-length &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot; (1982), and then in the 10 episode series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Partners in Crime&quot; (1983).

The novel &quot;By the Pricking of My Thumbs&quot; was adapted in 2005 by the French director Pascal Thomas with the title &quot;Mon petit doigt m&#x27;a dit...&quot;. The film casts André Dussolier as Tommy (renamed Bélisaire) and Catherine Frot as Prudence Beresford. The action is transposed to Savoie in France. A second film &quot;Le crime est notre affaire&quot;, came out in 2008. &quot;Le crime est notre affaire&quot; is named after &quot;Partners in Crime&quot; and stars the Beresfords, but its story is based on &quot;4.50 from Paddington&quot;, which was originally a novel starring Miss Marple. A third film &quot;Associés contre le crime&quot; is very, very loosely based (to the point of being unrecognisable) on one of the stories in &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;.

An adaptation of &quot;By the Pricking of My Thumbs&quot; appeared in 2006 as an episode of the Granada television series &quot;Marple&quot; even though Christie did not write Miss Marple into the original story. In this version, Tommy and Tuppence were played by Anthony Andrews and Greta Scacchi respectively, but, unlike in the book, Miss Marple and Tuppence play the detective roles while Tommy is away on intelligence (MI6) business.

In 2015 BBC television aired &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;, it starred David Walliams as Tommy and Jessica Raine as Tuppence.

<text>The Pityusic Islands, often referenced simply as the Pityuses ( , ; from the Greek πιτύα &quot;pitýa&quot;, pine tree), or commonly but informally (and ambiguously) as the Pine Islands, is the name given collectively to the Balearic Islands of Ibiza (Catalan: &quot;Eivissa&quot;), Formentera, S&#x27;Espalmador and other small islets in the Mediterranean Sea.

== Geography ==

The islands are situated approximately southwest of the island of Majorca, and approximately east of the Cap de la Nau in the Iberian Peninsula.

== History ==
The first known name of the islands was the Ancient Greek geonym Πιτυοῦσσαι &quot;Pityûssai&quot; (&quot;covered in pine trees&quot;).

From about 200 BCE, the islands were used as a base by Cilician pirates. They and a renegade Roman general, Quintus Sertorius, who had formed an alliance with the pirates, were driven out by a large Roman fleet, commanded by Caius Annius Luscus.

The two largest of the islands, under the names &quot;Ebyssus&quot; (Ibiza) and &quot;Ophiusis&quot; (Formentera), were listed in Claudius Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2nd century CE). Ptolemy noted that &quot;Ebyssus&quot; had a town by the same name.

== Administration ==
The Pine Islands are sometimes grouped together as part of the Balearic Islands, or else considered separate with the Balearics proper being Mallorca and Menorca (which together with their islets form the Gymnesian Islands). Politically, they are part of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands.

Initially, they were administratively part of the same insular council (of Ibiza and Formentera), but since 2007 they are now separated between the insular council of Ibiza and the insular council of Formentera (each one is also assimilated to a single comarca), which are two of the four main administrative subdivisions of the province (and autonomous community) of the Balearic Islands.

<text>Spitalfields () is an area in London, England and is located in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is in East London and situated in the East End. Spitalfields is formed around Commercial Street and Brick Lane. It has several markets, including Spitalfields Market, the historic Old Spitalfields Market, Brick Lane Market and Petticoat Lane Market. The area has a long attracted migrants from overseas, including many Jews, whose presence gained the area the 19th century nickname of &quot;Little Jerusalem&quot;.

It was a Hamlet (autonomous area) of the large ancient parish of Stepney in Middlesex, and became an independent parish in 1729. Just outside the City of London, it formed part of the County of London from 1889 and was part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney from 1900. It was abolished as a civil parish in 1921.

==Origin and administration==
===Toponymy===
The name Spitalfields appears in the form &quot;Spittellond&quot; in 1399; as &quot;The spitel Fyeld&quot; on the &quot;Woodcut&quot; map of London of c.1561; and as &quot;Spyttlefeildes&quot;, also in 1561. The land belonged to St Mary Spital, a priory or hospital (a lodging for travellers run by a religious order) erected on the east side of the Bishopsgate thoroughfare in 1197, from which its name is thought to derive (&quot;spital&quot; being a corruption of the word &quot;hospital&quot;.) An alternative, and possibly earlier, name for the area was &quot;Lolsworth&quot;.

===Administrative history===
The area was a part of the manor and ancient parish of Stepney before the Domesday Book of 1086. 

Parish areas originally had only ecclesiastical (church) functions; but the monasteries which had provided extensive charitable work on a voluntary basis, were dissolved by Henry VIII, creating increased hardship. The government responded by making parish areas take on civil functions, primarily a new Poor Law intended to fill the gap left by monasteries. 

Stepney was a very large and populous parish, and by the late 17th century it had devolved its civil parish functions to autonomous areas called Hamlets (in this context meaning territorial sub-divisions, rather than small villages), of which Spitalfields was one.

In 1729, the Hamlet of Spitalfields became an independent daughter parish. The area&#x27;s parish church was Christ Church, Spitalfields, with St Stephen Spitalfields (demolished in 1930) added later. 

In 1855, the parish became part of the Whitechapel District within the Metropolitan Board of Works area. Spitalfields Vestry nominated twelve members to the Whitechapel District Board of Works. The Board of Works was an unelected body, responsible for certain infrastructure functions.

Spitalfields became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney in 1900 and was abolished as a civil parish in 1921. It became part of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1965.

The area was part of the historic (or ancient) county of Middlesex, but military and most (or all) civil county functions were managed more locally, by the Tower Division (also known as the Tower Hamlets), a historic ‘county within a county’, under the leadership of the Lord-Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets (the post was always filled by the Constable of the Tower of London). The military loyalty to the Tower meant local men served in the Tower garrison and Tower Hamlets Militia, rather than the Middlesex Militia.

The role of the &quot;Tower Division&quot; ended when Spitalfields became part of the new County of London in 1889. The County of London was replaced by Greater London in 1965.

===Representation===

Nearly all (except a tiny area north of the railway, in Weaver&#x27;s Ward) of the district is part of the Spitalfields &amp; Banglatown ward, which elects two councillors to Tower Hamlets Borough Council. Spitalfields is in the Bethnal Green and Bow constituency, represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2010 by Rushanara Ali of the Labour Party.

The Spitalfields Neighbourhood Planning Forum, which is constitituted of Spitalfields residents, business operators, community organisations and other local interests, is intended to help local people influence neighbourhood planning policies.

== History ==
===Roman era===
The Romans had a cemetery to the east of the Bishopsgate thoroughfare, which roughly follows the line of Ermine Street: the main highway to the north from Londinium. The cemetery was noticed by the antiquarian John Stow in 1576 and was the focus of a major archaeological excavation in the 1990s, following the redevelopment of Spitalfields Market. 

In 2013, Janet Montgomery of Durham University undertook lead isotope analysis of tooth enamel, identifying the first person from Rome known to have been buried in Britain. She was a 25-year-old woman, buried in a lead-lined stone sarcophagus around the middle of the 4th century A.D., and accompanied by grave goods of jet and glass.

===St Mary Spital===
In 1197, a priory, &quot;The New Hospital of St Mary without Bishopsgate&quot;, latterly known as &quot;St Mary Spital&quot;, was founded by Walter Brunus and his wife Roisia, and built on the site of the cemetery. It was one of the biggest hospitals in medieval England and had a large cemetery with a mortuary chapel and stone charnel house. The chapel has been uncovered by archaeologists and preserved for public viewing. The priory and hospital were dissolved in 1539 under Henry VIII. At the time of the dissolution, the hospital had beds for 180 sick poor. 

The inner precinct of priory hospital was adjacent to the area that later became the Hamlet and parish of Spitalfields, in the tiny extra-parochial area called the Liberty of Norton Folgate. Although the chapel and monastic buildings were mostly demolished in the time of Henry VIII, the Liberty remained an autonomous area outside of any parish. The adjacent outer precincts, to the south, were re-used for artillery practice by the gunners of the Tower of London. The area, known as the Old Artillery Ground was placed under the special jurisdiction of the Tower of London as one of its Tower Liberties. 

Other parts of the priory area were used for residential purposes by London dwellers seeking a rural retreat and by the mid-17th century further development extended eastward into the erstwhile open farmland of the Spital Field.

===Huguenots===
Spitalfields consisted mainly of fields and nursery gardens until its development in the late 17th century. The main local industry at that time was weaving, and many of the weavers were Huguenot refugees from France. Spitalfields&#x27; historic association with the silk industry was established by French Protestant (Huguenot) refugees who settled in the area after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. By settling outside the bounds of the City of London, they hoped to avoid the restrictive legislation of the City guilds. The Huguenots brought with them little, apart from their skills, and an Order in Council of 16 April 1687 raised £200,000 to relieve their poverty. In December 1687, the first report of the committee set up to administer the funds reported that 13,050 French refugees were settled in London, primarily around Spitalfields, but also in the nearby settlements of Bethnal Green, Shoreditch, Whitechapel and Mile End New Town.

The late 17th and 18th centuries saw an estate of well-appointed terraced houses, built to accommodate the master weavers controlling the silk industry, and grand urban mansions built around the newly created Bishops Square which adjoins the short section of the main east–west street known as Spital Square. Christ Church, Spitalfields on Fournier Street, designed by the architect Nicholas Hawksmoor, was built during the reign of Queen Anne to demonstrate the power of the established church to the dissenting Huguenots, who had built ten chapels in the area. More humble weavers dwellings were congregated in the Tenterground. The Spitalfields Mathematical Society was established in 1717. In 1846, it merged with the Royal Astronomical Society.

Spitalfields Market was established in 1638 when Charles I gave a licence for flesh, fowl and roots to be sold in what was then known as Spittle Fields. The market currently receives around 25,000 visitors every week.

Huguenots of Spitalfields is a registered charity promoting public understanding of the Huguenot heritage and culture in Spitalfields, the City of London and beyond. They arrange tours, talks, events and schools programmes to raise the Huguenot profile in Spitalfields and to raise funds for a permanent memorial to the Huguenots.

From the 1730s Irish weavers came, after a decline in the Irish linen industry, to take up work in the silk trade. The 18th century saw periodic crises in the silk industry, brought on by imports of French silk – in a lull between the wars between the two rivals; and imports of printed calicos. The depression in the trade and the prices paid to weavers led to protests. In 1769, the Spitalfield riots occurred when attempts were made to disperse protest meetings by weavers during the downturn in the market for silk. The riots ended in an Irish and a Huguenot weaver being hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball public house at Bethnal Green.

Price controls on amounts master weavers could pay journeymen for each piece were established, removing incentives to pay higher wages during good times. During bad times workers had no work. As the price was per piece, there was no incentive for using machinery, as the master would have to pay for the machine and still pay the same price per piece to journeymen. By 1822 labour rates were so above market labour rates, that much of the employment in silk manufacture had moved away. Remaining manufacture focussed on expensive fashion items, which required proximity to court and had higher margins.

In 1729, Spitalfields was detached from the parish of Stepney, and became an independent parish; by this time parish areas had both civil and ecclesiastical (church) functions. The area&#x27;s parish church was Christ Church, Spitalfields, with St Stephen Spitalfields added later. The church of St Stephen Spitalfields was built in 1860 by public subscription but was demolished in 1930. The adjacent vicarage is all that remains.

===Victorian era===
By the Victorian era, the silk industry had entered a long decline and the old merchant dwellings had degenerated into multi-occupied slums. Spitalfields became a by-word for urban deprivation, and, by 1832, concern about a London cholera epidemic led &quot;The Poor Man&#x27;s Guardian&quot; (18 February 1832) to write of Spitalfields:
The low houses are all huddled together in close and dark lanes and alleys, presenting at first sight an appearance of non-habitation, so dilapidated are the doors and windows:- in every room of the houses, whole families, parents, children and aged grandfathers swarm together.

In 1860, a treaty with France allowed the import of cheaper French silks. This left the many weavers in Spitalfields, as well as neighbouring Bethnal Green and Shoreditch, unemployed and indigent. New trades such as furniture and boot making came to the area, and the large windowed Huguenot houses were found suitable for tailoring, attracting a new population of Jewish refugees drawn to live and work in the textile industry.
By the later 19th century, inner Spitalfields became known as the worst criminal rookery in London and common lodging-houses in the Flower and Dean Street area were a focus for the activities of robbers and pimps. In 1881, Flower and Dean Street was described as being &quot;perhaps the foulest and most dangerous street in the metropolis&quot;. Another claimant to the distinction of being the worst street in London was Dorset Street, which was highlighted by the brutal killing and mutilation of a young woman, Mary Jane Kelly, in her lodgings here by the serial killer, Jack the Ripper in the autumn of 1888. The murder was the climax of a series of murders that became known as the Whitechapel Murders.
The renewed focus on the area&#x27;s poverty helped prompt the decision to demolish some local slums in 1891–94. Deprivation continued and was brought to notice by social commentators such as Jack London in his &quot;The People of the Abyss&quot; (1903). He highlighted &#x27;Itchy Park&#x27;, next to Christ Church, Spitalfields, as a notorious rendezvous for homeless people.

===Modern Spitalfields===

In the late 20th century the Jewish presence diminished and was replaced by an influx of Bangladeshi immigrants, who also worked in the local textile industry and made Brick Lane the curry capital of London. By 1981, at least 60% of households were of minority ethnic origin.

Another development, from the 1960s onwards, has been a campaign to save the housing stock of old merchant terraces west of Brick Lane from demolition. Many have been conserved by the Spitalfields Historic Buildings Trust which has led to gentrification and a large increase in property prices.
In the 21st century, large office blocks were built between Bishopsgate and Spitalfields Market, affecting the character of the area. Conservationists secured the preservation of Old Spitalfields Market and the provision of shopping, leisure amenities and a plaza (urban square) beside the blocks, but permission was granted to developers, to demolish the Fruit and Wool exchange on the edge of old Spitalfields market, in order to erect office buildings.

Since 1998 the area has formed part of the &quot;Spitalfields and Banglatown&quot; electoral ward. The name reflecting the areas strong links with Bangladesh. In September 2015, a demonstration against gentrification in London took the form of a protest at Cereal Killer Cafe, a hipster café on Brick Lane which serves cereal.

== Community ==
Spitalfields has a strong sense of local community, with the Spitalfields Community Group aiming to represent the people in the area to build a better sense of community as well as improve the quality of life of its members and their neighbours in Spitalfields. The Spitalfields Housing Association also works closely with residents by providing community services. 

A community garden, Nomadic Community Gardens, is a social project based in an area once an area fenced off and overgrown and is popular among a diverse range of people such as locals without gardens, and is made up of found materials, street art, sculpture and allotments. Nomadic Community Gardens is a temporary project or &quot;meanwhile use&quot; run by a private limited company on behalf of the property developer Londonewcastle, which leases the site to the garden operator for a peppercorn rent and provided start-up funding. Planning consent was gained for a development of &quot;affordable housing, townhouses and apartments&quot; on the site in November 2015. Construction on the Fleet Street Hill Project was intended to commence in 2016 but, as of June 2019, no work has begun on the site.

== Culture ==
Dennis Severs&#x27; House in Folgate Street is a &quot;still-life drama&quot; created by the Severs as an &quot;historical imagination&quot; of what life would have been like inside for a family of Huguenot silk weavers. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings has its headquarters nearby, at 37 Spital Square, a Georgian terraced house once inhabited by Huguenots and Russian Jewish leatherworkers. Whitechapel Art Gallery is on the north side of Whitechapel High Street.

Amongst the many well known artists living in Spitalfields are Gilbert and George, Tracey Emin and Stuart Brisley. TV presenter and architecture expert Dan Cruickshank was an active campaigner for Spitalfields, and continues to live in the area. Writer Jeanette Winterson turned a derelict Georgian house into an organic food shop, Verde&#x27;s, as part of the Slow Food movement.

Spitalfields figures in a number of works of literature, including &quot;A New Wonder, a Woman Never Vexed&quot; (performed 1610–14; printed 1632) by William Rowley, a dramatisation of the foundation of St Mary Spital; &quot;The People of the Abyss&quot; (1903), the journalistic memoir by Jack London; &quot;Hawksmoor&quot; (1985) by Peter Ackroyd; &quot;Rodinsky&#x27;s Room&quot; (1999) by Iain Sinclair and Rachel Lichtenstein; &quot;Brick Lane&quot; (2003) by Monica Ali; and &quot;The Quincunx&quot; (1991) by Charles Palliser.

In December 2009 an anonymous Spitalfields resident started a blog called &quot;Spitalfields Life&quot;, writing under the pseudonym &quot;The Gentle Author&quot;, and promising to post 10,000 daily essays. , the writer had posted over 4,000 articles about life in Spitalfields, and the surrounding areas within walking distance.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Spitalfields has no connection to the London Underground. Historically it had a station on the Great Eastern Main Line called Bishopsgate (Low Level) that opened on the 4 November 1872, but closed on 22 May 1916. Shoreditch tube station, the northern terminus of the East London Line, technically lay within the boundaries of Spitalfields, but principally served Shoreditch: it closed in 2006. Liverpool Street station (mainline and underground), Aldgate East (underground) and Shoreditch High Street (London Overground) are all in close proximity to Spitalfields.

===Road===
The area is formed around Commercial Street (on the A1202 London Inner Ring Road).

<text>Ibiza (; , commonly also or simply ) is a city and municipality located on the southeast coast of the island of Ibiza in the Balearic Islands autonomous community.

==Overview==
The name of &quot;Ibiza&quot; in Catalan is and it is sometimes called or simply (&quot;Town&quot;). It is divided into two main parts: the old town, called the (literally &quot;Upper Town&quot;), located on a little mountain by the sea, and the modern part, called the (&quot;Extension&quot;).

The city, which has a population of 50,643 (2021), is the capital and most populous settlement of the island and of the Pityusic Islands group, which includes Ibiza and Formentera.

==Tourism==
===Nightlife===
Ibiza is widely known and visited for its exciting nightlife. Some of the island&#x27;s most notable nightclubs include Pacha, Amnesia, Space, and Ushuaïa. These four nightclubs are regularly in the top three of DJ Magazine&#x27;s annual top 100 global clubs&#x27; chart.

===Sightseeing===

Sights include the cathedral of Santa Maria d&#x27;Eivissa (14th century), located at the top of the Dalt Vila, and the Punic necropolis of Puig des Molins. Nearby is also the monument of Christ, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a statue inspired by &quot;Christ the Redeemer&quot;, which is north of the city.

==Climate==
Ibiza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh), bordering on a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa). The average annual temperature of Ibiza is , being mild and stable throughout the whole year. The climate of Ibiza is typically warm, sunny and dry, with low variation between highs and lows. The sunshine hours of Ibiza are 2700-2800 per year, while the yearly rain amount goes from . The average high temperature is , while the average low is . Winters are slightly rainy and mild, from November to April normally the whole island turns green for the seasonal rains. Summers are hot and fairly humid, but with very little rainfall. The few rainy days are often accompanied by thunderstorms. During the coldest month, January, the average high temperature is , while the average low is . In the warmest month, August, the average high temperature is , while the low is . Freezes and extreme temperatures are rare due to the influence of the sea. Ibiza has never been above or under since temperature records began in 1952. The average temperature of the sea around Ibiza is .

<doc id="381465" wikidata="Q3407063" url="?curid=381465" title="National Energy Program">
<text>The National Energy Program (, NEP) was an energy policy of the Canadian federal government from 1980 to 1985. The economically nationalist policy sought to secure Canadian energy independence, though was strongly opposed by the private sector and the oil-producing Western Canadian provinces, most notably Alberta.

Created under the Liberal government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau on October 28, 1980, following the two oil crises of the 1970s, the NEP had three main objectives: increase ownership of the oil industry by Canadians; price energy fairly for Canadian consumers; and provide Canadian energy self-sufficiency. The NEP was also designed to promote lower prices through price controls; promote exploration for oil in Canada; promote alternative energy sources; and increase federal government revenues from oil sales through a variety of taxes and revenue-sharing with the oil-producing Western Canadian provinces.

The NEP proved to be a highly controversial policy initiative and sparked intense opposition and anger in Western Canada, particularly in Alberta. The province&#x27;s premier, Peter Lougheed, was a vocal opponent of the NEP on the grounds that it interfered with provincial jurisdiction and unfairly deprived Alberta of oil revenue. In 1981, Lougheed and Trudeau reached a revenue-sharing agreement. Opponents claim that due to the NEP, the unemployment rate in Alberta rose from 3.7 percent to 12.4 percent, the bankruptcy rate in Alberta rose by 150 percent, and Alberta&#x27;s losses were estimated to be between $50 billion and $100 billion (though Alberta&#x27;s unemployment rate, bankruptcy rate, and revenue losses were also affected by the early 1980s recession and a crash in oil prices).

The term &quot;Western alienation&quot; was coined as a result of the NEP. The policy was repealed by the newly-elected Progressive Conservative (PC) government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on June 1, 1985. The NEP contributed to the creation and rise of the Western Canadian-based and right-wing populist Reform Party which made a major breakthrough in the 1993 federal election; the Reform Party merged with the PCs in 2003, becoming the Conservative Party which governed Canada from 2006 to 2015.

==Background==
In his preamble to the announcement of the National Energy Program, introduced as part of the October 1980 federal budget, Finance Minister Allan MacEachen echoed concerns by leaders of developed countries regarding the recession that followed both oil crises of the 1970s and the &quot;deeply troubling air of uncertainty and anxiety&quot; that was shared by Canadians. The Bank of Canada reported that economic problems had been accelerated and magnified. Inflation was most commonly between 9% and 10% annually, and prime interest rates were over 10%.

===Global context===
Historically, the United States had been by far the world&#x27;s largest oil producer, and the world oil market had been dominated by a small number of giant multinational (mostly-American) oil companies (the so-called &quot;Seven Sisters of oil&quot;: Standard Oil of New Jersey, alias Exxon (US); Standard Oil of New York, alias Mobil (US/UK); Standard Oil of California, alias Chevron (US), Gulf Oil, now part of Chevron (US); Texaco, now part of Chevron (US); Anglo-Persian Oil Company, alias BP (UK); and Royal Dutch Shell, alias Shell (UK/Netherlands). During the late 1940s, the 1950s, the 1960s, and the early 1970s, the discovery and development of many giant oil and gas fields outside the US by those and other companies kept the world flooded with cheap oil. Meanwhile, global demand increased to take advantage of the increased global supply at lower prices. In particular, US oil consumption increased faster than production, and the country, which had been a net oil exporter, became a major oil importer.

In 1970, US oil production unexpectedly peaked and started to decline, which caused global oil markets to tighten rapidly as the US started to import more and more Arab oil. As the decade continued, global demand caught up with global supply, and two major oil price shocks occurred: the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 oil crisis. The first occurred after the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), whose membership is the Arab members of the similarly named Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), plus Egypt, Syria, and Tunisia, imposed an embargo on oil exports to the US, the UK, the Netherlands, Japan, and Canada in retaliation for supporting for Israel during the Yom Kippur War. US producers had been able to defeat the 1967 oil embargo by ramping up domestic production and flooding the world market with additional product at cut-rate prices, but declining domestic production and the ongoing rise in global demand prevented a similar response to the 1973 Arab embargo. The result was immediate shortages and lineups for gasoline in importing countries, particularly the US, which signalled the end of decades of cheap oil and a change in the balance of power from consuming countries, which now included the United States, to producing countries. On October 16, 1973, the Ministerial Committee of the Persian Gulf&#x27;s OPEC membership announced an immediate rise in its posted price from $2.18 to $5.12 per barrel of oil. &quot;Thus for the first time in oil history, the producing countries assumed power to consider and set the oil price &quot;unilaterally&quot;, and independently of the&quot; Seven Sisters.

The Yom Kippur War ended in October, but the price of oil continued to increase, and by January 1974, it had quadrupled to US$12 a barrel. &quot;The more than seven-fold increase in the oil price from $1.80/b in 1970 to $13.54/b in 1978 created profound and far-reaching changes in the world oil balance, as well as the prevailing relationships among major oil producers, principal oil importers, and the major oil companies... [and the] spectacular jump of the crude spot price to more than $US40/b following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, turned the global oil market into total disarray.&quot; The Norwegian economics historian Ola Honningdal Grytten described that period in the 1970s as one of a prolonged global recession and slow growth that affected most developed economies.

The 1979 oil crisis, precipitated by the Iranian Revolution and compounded by the Iran–Iraq War, was the second major market disturbance in the 1970s. &quot;The curtailment of oil supplies and the skyrocketing of oil prices had far-reaching effects on producers, consumers, and the oil industry itself.&quot;

In his State of the Union Address in January 1980, US President Jimmy Carter described how his country&#x27;s &quot;excessive dependence on foreign oil is a clear and present danger,&quot; and he called for a &quot;clear, comprehensive energy policy for the United States.&quot;

===Canadian context===

The Canadian petroleum industry arose in parallel with that of the US. The first oil well in North America was dug in Ontario in 1848 by using picks and shovels, one year before the first oil well in the United States had been drilled in Pennsylvania. By 1870, Canada had 100 oil refineries in operation and was exporting oil to Europe. However, the oil fields of Ontario were shallow and small, and oil production started to decline around 1900 while the automobile started to become popular. In contrast, US oil production grew rapidly after huge discoveries had been made in Texas, Oklahoma, California, and elsewhere. By the end of World War II, Canada imported 90% of its oil, mostly from the US.

The situation changed dramatically in 1947, when Imperial Oil drilled a well near Leduc, Alberta, to see what was causing peculiar anomalies on its newly introduced reflection seismology surveys. The peculiar anomalies turned out to be oil fields, and Leduc No. 1 was the discovery well for the first of many large oil fields. As a consequence of the large finds, cheap and plentiful Alberta oil produced a huge surplus of oil on the Canadian Prairies, which had no immediate market since the major oil markets were in Ontario and Quebec. In 1949, Imperial Oil applied to the federal government to build the Interprovincial Pipeline (IPL) to Lake Superior, which allowed it to supply the Midwestern United States. By 1956, the pipeline had been extended via Sarnia, Ontario, to Toronto; at , it became the longest oil pipeline in the world. The federal government gave approval to build a pipeline in Western Canada, and in 1953, the Transmountain Pipeline was built from Edmonton to Vancouver, British Columbia, with an extension to northwest Washington. The pipelines did more to improve the energy security of the United States than that of Canada since the Canadian government was more interested in Canada&#x27;s trade balance than in military or energy security. The Canadian government assumed that Eastern Canada could always import enough oil to meet its needs and that imported oil would always be cheaper than domestic oil.

====National Energy Board====

The National Energy Board (NEB) was created in 1959 &quot;to monitor and report on all federal matters of energy as well as regulate pipelines, energy imports and exports and utility rates and tariffs.&quot; The NEB regulated mostly the construction and the operation of oil and natural gas pipelines crossing provincial or international borders. The Board approved pipeline traffic, tolls, and tariffs under the authority of the National Energy Board Act.

From its introduction in 1961 to its end in September 1973, the National Oil Policy (NOP) was the cornerstone of Canadian energy policy. It &quot;established a protected market for domestic oil west of the Ottawa Valley, which freed the industry from foreign competition,&quot; and the five eastern provinces, which included major refineries in Ontario and Quebec, continued to rely on foreign imports of crude oil, such as from Venezuela. In 1973, &quot;the federal government announced the extension of the inter-provincial oil pipeline to Montreal (completed in 1976), froze prices of domestic crude and certain oil products, and sought to control export prices. The federal government announced this change in policy so that supply problems in the United States would not automatically raise prices for Canadian consumers.&quot;

After the first OPEC price shock in 1973, the federal government &quot;formally broke the link between domestic prices and international prices. The objective of &#x27;made-in-Canada&#x27; prices for crude oil was to protect Canadians across the country from the whims of the world oil market and to provide producers with enough incentives to develop new energy resources.&quot;

In 1981, the Edmonton economist Brian Scarfe claimed that the NEB&#x27;s setting of the price of oil and natural gas in Canada meant that producers did not receive full world prices for the resource and that consumers were not charged world prices. He claimed that the subsidies had a number of side effects, including larger trade deficits, larger federal budget deficits, higher real interest rates, and higher inflation.

====Petro-Canada====
In 1975, in response to the world energy crisis, the federal government created Petro-Canada, a Canadian crown corporation that was national oil company. Petro-Canada was involved in the massive Hibernia oil find off Newfoundland and was a partner in the Syncrude oil sands venture in Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Alberta oil industry was then overwhelmingly owned by Americans, who were also the major importer of Albertan oil. The Petro-Canada Centre (1975–2009) was known in the oil patch as &quot;Red Square&quot; until its purchase by Suncor. The NEP included plans for a &quot;greatly-expanded Petro-Canada.&quot;

====Price controls====
In 1974, Canada inaugurated its first system for pricing oil with three objectives: to regulate prices of domestic crude oil by federal-provincial agreements, to subsidize imported oil so that consumers in Eastern Canada would enjoy lower prices, and to control prices and quantities of crude oil and products in the exporting market. Synthetic crude oil (upgraded petroleum from oil sands) was exempted from the policy and was sold at the world price. The federal government levied a tax on all oil refined in Canada to pay for the difference between the price of synthetic and that of conventional crude oil.

The federal budget in October 1980 reflected the concern that Canada could &quot;become increasingly dependent on insecure foreign supplies and, therefore, unnecessarily subject to the vagaries of the world oil market.&quot;

On 28 October 1980, Finance Minister Allan MacEachen introduced the National Energy Program but cautioned that things could get worse if there were &quot;new shocks coming from the price of oil or food or if the upward momentum of costs and prices proves impervious to the economic climate I am seeking to create.&quot; 
==Goals==
The NEP&#x27;s goals were &quot;security of supply and ultimate independence from the world oil market; opportunity for all Canadians to participate in the energy industry; particularly oil and gas, and to share in the benefits of its expansion; and fairness, with a pricing and revenue-sharing regime which recognizes the needs and rights of all Canadians.&quot;

The NEP had three main objectives: increase ownership of the oil industry by Canadians; price energy fairly for Canadian consumers; and provide Canadian energy self-sufficiency. The NEP was also designed to promote lower prices with price controls; promote exploration for oil in Canada; promote alternative energy sources; and increase federal government revenues from oil sales through a variety of taxes and revenue-sharing agreements.

The NEP&#x27;s Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) instituted a double-taxation mechanism that did not apply to other commodities, such as gold and copper (see &quot;Program details&quot; item (c), below), &quot;to redistribute revenue from the [oil] industry and lessen the cost of oil for Eastern Canada&quot; in an attempt to insulate the Canadian economy from the shock of rising global oil prices (see &quot;Program details&quot; item (a), below). In 1981, Scarfe argued that by keeping domestic oil prices below world market prices, the NEP was essentially mandating provincial generosity and subsidizing all Canadian consumers of fuel, because of Alberta and the other oil-producing provinces (such as Newfoundland, which received funding by the NEP for the Hibernia project).

However, Marc Lalonde, the Minister of Energy Mines and Resources whose department oversaw development of the NEP would later say in 1986: &quot;The major factor behind the NEP wasn&#x27;t Canadianization or getting more from the industry or even self sufficiency,&quot; [...] &quot;The determinant factor was the fiscal imbalance between the provinces and the federal government [...] &quot;Our proposal was to increase Ottawa&#x27;s share appreciably, so that the share of the producing provinces would decline significantly and the industry&#x27;s share would decline somewhat.&quot;

===Details===
The NEP &quot;had three principles: (1) security of supply and ultimate independence from the world market, (2) opportunity for all Canadians to participate in the energy industry, particularly oil and gas, and to share in the benefits of its expansion, and (3) fairness, with a pricing and revenue-sharing regime which recognizes the needs and rights of all Canadians.&quot;

&quot;The main elements of the program included:

(a) a blended or &#x27;made-in-Canada&#x27; price of oil, an average of the costs of imported and domestic oil, which will rise gradually and predictably but will remain well below world prices and will never be more than 85 per cent of the lower of the price of imported oil or of oil in the US, and which will be financed by a Petroleum Compensation Charge levied on refiners...;

(b) natural gas prices which will increase less quickly than oil prices, but which will include a new and rising federal tax on all natural gas and gas liquids;

(c) a petroleum and gas revenue tax of 8 per cent applied to net operating revenues before royalty and other expense deductions on all production of oil and natural gas in Canada...;

(d) the phasing out of the depletion allowances for oil and gas exploration and development, which will be replaced with a new system of direct incentive payments, structured to encourage investment by Canadian companies, with added incentives for exploration on Canada Lands (lands which the federal government held the mineral rights as opposed to private lands and lands which provinces held the mineral rights);

(e) a federal share of petroleum production income at the wellhead which will rise from about 10 per cent in recent years to 24 per cent over the 1980-83 period, with the share of the producing provinces falling from 45 to 43 per cent and that of the industry falling from 45 to 33 per cent over the same period;

(f) added incentives for energy conservation and energy conversion away from oil, particularly applicable to Eastern Canada, including the extension of the natural gas pipe-line system to Quebec City and the maritimes, with the additional transport charges being passed back to the producer; and

(g) a Canadian ownership levy to assist in financing the acquisition of the Canadian operations of one or more multinational oil companies, with the objective of achieving at least 50 per cent Canadian ownership of oil and gas production by 1990, Canadian control of a significant number of the major oil and gas corporations, and an early increase in the share of the oil and gas sector owned by the Government of Canada.&quot;

==Impact on Alberta==

===Revenues===

While the program increased domestic price controls, the emphasis on revenue sharing and incentives for oil exploration on federally owned lands was viewed critically by Alberta Premier Peter Lougheed. Lougheed fought the program vigorously in the courts and in public, where he actively stoked Alberta nationalism in a television address, stating the program would bring more &quot;Ottawa&quot; to the province. Prior to the announcement of the National Energy Program, Lougheed had threatened to reduce Alberta&#x27;s production of oil and gas to counter any federal program to increase taxes. If Alberta reduced production, Central Canada refineries and other businesses would need to purchase foreign oil which would be heavily subsidized by the federal government, a cost that it could not afford to with a $13.7 billion deficit in 1980. 

Lougheed finally decided to exercise this authority to force Trudeau to concede some measures of the Program, and Lougheed announced on television a 60,000 barrel reduction to Alberta&#x27;s production of crude oil to take place over nine months beginning in April 1981, and the suspension of two oil sands projects. Lougheed however pledged that he would not allow a national oil shortage to occur, and would suspend the cuts if a shortage occurred. The threat was successful as Trudeau and Lougheed signed &quot;an oil and gas prices and revenue sharing&quot; agreement in 1981:


Lougheed&#x27;s success in the agreement was marked by a widely published photograph of a celebratory champagne toast with Trudeau and himself. Lougheed later admitted to regretting the toast.

Lougheed&#x27;s battle with the National Energy Program corresponded with the 1980s oil glut where energy prices dropped dramatically due to falling demand. Lougheed was forced to lower royalty rates through the Oil and Gas Activity Program and focused the government&#x27;s efforts on natural gas diversification to stem falling revenues and a declining economy.

Helliwell et al. (1983) reported that the early 1980s energy price declines prompted the federal and provincial governments to update their revenue-sharing agreements. The amended agreements allowed for $4.2 billion in higher revenues ($1.7 billion for the federal government and $1.2 billion each for the provincial governments and industry), which was 30% of the increase that would have been gained from going to world prices. According to Helliwell et al., the NEP made did not in fact cause industry to be significantly exposed to the declining global oil prices, but the largest part of direct revenue losses accrued to governments. Thus, industry operated throughout the period of the NEP under relatively-similar oil prices, the &quot;made-in-Canada&quot; oil price (see item (a) in National Energy Program Details, above).

In 1981, the Edmonton economist Scarfe argued that the greatest impact of the NEP was its failure to deliver the revenues that had been originally forecast in the 1980 federal budget. Introduced by Finance Minister Allan MacEachen, it projected a reduction of federal deficits from $14.2 billion in 1980 to $11.8 billion in fiscal 1984, primarily from substantial increases in revenues from the oil and gas sector, and the maintenance of expenditures. Scarfe speculated that the NEP would discourage large-scale oil investment projects and thus reduce these projected revenues. Federal deficits had been expected to decrease, primarily by substantial increases in revenues from oil and gas. Instead, by 1983, the Ministry of Finance had concluded that the federal government had established a structural deficit of $29.7 billion, an increase from 3.5% of GNP in 1980 to 6.2% of GNP in 1983.

Estimates have placed Alberta&#x27;s losses between $50 billion and $100 billion because of the NEP. Alberta still initially enjoyed an economic surplus due to high oil prices, but the surplus was heavily reduced by the NEP, which, in turn, stymied many of Lougheed&#x27;s policies for economic diversification to reduce Alberta&#x27;s dependence on the cyclical energy industry, such as the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, and also left the province with an infrastructure deficit. In particular, the Alberta Heritage Fund was meant to save as much of the earnings during high oil prices to act as a &quot;rainy day&quot; cushion if oil prices collapsed because of the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry. The NEP was one reason that the fund failed to grow to its full potential. In 2022, the Heritage Savings Trust Fund has $19B, a moderate increase on the $13B it had in 1986. This slow growth occurred despite some years when Alberta government had multi-billion-dollar surpluses.

===GDP===
Alberta&#x27;s GDP was between $60 billion and $80 billion annually during the years of the NEP (1980-1986). It is unclear whether the estimates took into account the decline in world crude oil prices that began only a few months after the NEP had come into force, the graph of long-term oil prices shows that prices adjusted for inflation did not drop below pre-1980s levels until 1985. Since the program was cancelled in 1986, the NEP was active for five years with among the most expensive for oil prices on record, and the NEP prevented Alberta&#x27;s economy from fully realising those prices.

====Provincial per capita federal contributions====
In inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars, the year the NEP took effect (1980) per capita had fiscal contributions by Alberta to the federal government increase 77% over 1979 levels from $6,578 in 1979 to $11,641 in 1980. In the five years prior to the NEP (1975–1979), the per capita contributions by Alberta had approximated the fluctuations in the price of oil (see graph Fluctuations: Oil Prices &amp; Alberta Per Capita Federal Contributions 1975–1981). In 1980, however, the inflation-adjusted average price of oil was only 5% higher than the previous year, but the per capita contributions from Alberta rose 77% (see graph Fluctuations: Oil Prices &amp; Alberta Per Capita Federal Contributions 1975–1981).
Again in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars, the year the NEP was terminated (1986) had per capita contributions to the federal government by Alberta collapse to $680, a mere 10% of 1979 levels.

During the NEP years (1980–1985), only one other province was a net contributor per capita to the federal government: Saskatchewan, which also produces oil. In 1980 and 1981, Saskatchewan was a net per capita contributor to the federal government with a peak in 1981 at only $514, compared to Alberta&#x27;s peak of $12,735 the same year, both values being 2004 inflation-adjusted dollars. Thus, during the NEP (1980 to 1985), Alberta was the sole overall net contributor to the federal government, and all other provinces enjoyed being net recipients.

=== Bankruptcies and unemployment ===
In 1982, during the severe global recession, there were over 30,000 consumer bankruptcies in Canada, a 33% increase over the previous year. The bankruptcy rate began to fall from 1983 to 1985, as the economy strengthened. From 1980 to 1985, bankruptcies per 1,000 businesses in Canada peaked at 50% above the 1980 rate. Meanwhile, the bankruptcy rate in Alberta rose by 150% after the NEP took effect.

Since bankruptcies and real estate prices did not fare as negatively in Central Canada as in the rest of Canada and in the United States, the NEP might have had a positive effect in Central Canada.

The unemployment rate in Alberta rose from 3.7 percent in September 1980 to 12.4 percent in 1984 following passage of the NEP.

==Price of oil==
Throughout the 1950s, the 1960s, and the 1970s, the retail price of petroleum in Canada consistently remained close to the price of gasoline in the United States and was often lower than prices seen in the US, especially during the 1970s price spikes. The NEP, which raised the price of fuel in the West and coincided with a hike in provincial gas taxes in Ontario and Quebec, made the retail price of gasoline in Canada become noticeably higher than that of the US, a trend that has continued ever since.

==Abolition==
The rationale for the program weakened when world oil prices began a slow decline in the early 1980s and collapsed in late 1985. A phased shutdown was commenced by Jean Chrétien, then Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources.

In the 1984 election, the Progressive Conservative Party of Brian Mulroney was elected to a majority in the House of Commons with the support of Western Canada after he had campaigned against the NEP. However, Mulroney did not eliminate the last vestiges of the program until two-and-a half years later, when world oil prices had dropped below pre-1980s levels (as adjusted for inflation: see Long-Term Oil Prices, 1861–2007).

On June 1, 1985, after extensive discussions between the federal Government and the governments of the oil-producing provinces, the &quot;Western Accord on Energy&quot; was agreed. It provided for the full deregulation of oil prices and for allowing the market forces of international and local supply and demand determine prices. Included in the full deregulation of domestic oil prices, the Western Accord also &quot;abolished import subsidies, the export tax on crude and oil products, and the petroleum compensation charge. It also phased out PIP grants and the PGRT. In addition, controls were lifted on oil exports.&quot;

==Legacy and Western alienation==

The NEP was extremely unpopular in Western Canada, especially in Alberta, where most of Canada&#x27;s oil is produced. With natural resources falling constitutionally within the domain of provincial jurisdictions, many Albertans viewed the NEP as a detrimental intrusion by the federal government into the province&#x27;s affairs. Edmonton economist Scarfe argued that for people in Western Canada, especially Alberta, the NEP was perceived to be at their expense in benefiting the eastern provinces.
Particularly vilified was Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, whose Liberals had no seat west of Manitoba. Ed Clark, a senior bureaucrat in the Trudeau Liberal government, helped to develop the National Energy Program and earned himself the moniker &quot;Red Ed&quot; in the Alberta oil industry. Shortly after Brian Mulroney had taken office, Clark was fired.

Petro-Canada, established in 1975, was responsible for implementing much of the Program. Petro-Canada was given the backronym &quot;Pierre Elliott Trudeau Rips Off Canada&quot; by opponents of the National Energy Program.

According to Mary Elizabeth Vicente, an Edmonton librarian who wrote an article on the National Energy Program in 2005, the popular western slogan during the NEP, appearing on many bumper stickers, was &quot;Let the Eastern bastards freeze in the dark.&quot; Other bumpers stated &quot;I&#x27;d rather push this thing a mile than buy gas from PetroCan.&quot;

McKenzie argued in 1981 that politically, the NEP heightened distrust of the federal government in Western Canada, especially in Alberta, where many believed the NEP to be an intrusion of the federal government into an area of provincial jurisdiction.

According to a &quot;National Post&quot; journalist,

<text>Edward Charles Francis Publius de Bono (19 May 1933 – 9 June 2021) was a Maltese physician and commentator. He originated the term lateral thinking, and wrote many books on thinking, including &quot;Six Thinking Hats&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Edward Charles Francis Publius de Bono was born in Malta on 19 May 1933. He was the son of Josephine Burns de Bono.

Educated at St. Edward&#x27;s College, Malta, he then gained a medical degree from the University of Malta. Following this, he proceeded as a Rhodes Scholar in 1955 to Christ Church, Oxford, where he gained an MA in psychology and physiology. He represented Oxford in polo and set two canoeing records. He then gained a PhD degree in medicine from Cambridge University.

De Bono held faculty appointments at the universities of Oxford, Cambridge (where he helped to establish the university&#x27;s medical school), London and Harvard. He was a professor at the University of Malta, the University of Pretoria, the University of Central England (now called Birmingham City University) and Dublin City University. De Bono held the Da Vinci Professor of Thinking chair at the University of Advancing Technology in Tempe, Arizona, US. He was one of the 27 Ambassadors for the European Year of Creativity and Innovation 2009.

The originator of the term &#x27;Lateral Thinking&#x27;, de Bono wrote 85 books with translations into 46 languages. He taught his thinking methods to government agencies, corporate clients, organizations and individuals, privately or publicly in group sessions. He promoted the World Center for New Thinking (2004–2011), based in Malta, which applied Thinking Tools to solution and policy design on the geopolitical level.

In 1976, de Bono took part in a radio debate for the BBC with British philosopher A. J. Ayer, on the subject of effective democracy.

Starting on Wednesday 8 September 1982, the BBC ran a series of 10 weekly programmes entitled &quot;de Bono&#x27;s Thinking Course&quot;. In the shows, he explained how thinking skills could be improved by attention and practice. The series was repeated the following year. A book with the same title accompanied the series. In May 1994, he gave a half-hour &quot;Opinions&quot; lecture televised on Channel 4 and subsequently published in &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;Thinking Hats On&quot;. In 1995, he created a futuristic documentary film, &quot;2040: Possibilities by Edward de Bono&quot;, depicting a lecture to an audience of viewers released from a cryogenic freeze for contemporary society in the year 2040.

Convinced that a key way forward for humanity is a better language, he published &quot;The Edward de Bono Code Book&quot; in 2000. In this book, he proposed a suite of new words based on numbers, where each number combination represents a useful idea or situation that currently does not have a single-word representation. For example, de Bono code 6/2 means &quot;Give me my point of view and I will give you your point of view.&quot; Such a code might be used in situations where one or both of the two parties in a dispute are making insufficient effort to understand the other&#x27;s perspective.

===Parallel thinking===
Parallel thinking is a term coined by de Bono. Parallel thinking is described as a constructive alternative to: &quot;adversarial thinking&quot;; debate; and the approaches exemplified by Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle (whom de Bono refers to as the &quot;Greek gang of three&quot; (GG3)). In general, parallel thinking is a further development of the well-known lateral-thinking processes, focusing even more on explorations—looking for &quot;what can be&quot; rather than for &quot;what is&quot;.

Parallel thinking is defined as a thinking process where focus is split in specific directions. When done in a group it effectively avoids the consequences of the adversarial approach (as used in courts). In adversarial debate, the objective is to prove or disprove statements put forward by the parties (normally two). This is also known as the dialectic approach. In Parallel Thinking, practitioners put forward as many statements as possible in several (preferably more than two) parallel tracks. This leads to &quot;exploration&quot; of a subject where all participants can contribute, in parallel, with knowledge, facts, feelings, etc. Crucial to the method is that the process is done in a disciplined manner, and that all participants play along and contribute &quot;in parallel&quot;. Thus each participant must stick to the specific track. Six Thinking Hats is an example of its implementation.

== Other ideas ==
De Bono invented the L game, which he introduced in his book &quot;The Five-Day Course in Thinking&quot;.

In 2000, de Bono advised a UK Foreign Office committee that the Arab–Israeli conflict might be due, in part, to low levels of zinc found in people who eat unleavened bread (e.g. pita flatbread). De Bono argued that low zinc levels leads to heightened aggression. He suggested shipping out jars of Marmite to compensate.

Edward de Bono argued that companies could raise money just as governments now do – by printing it. He put forward the idea of private currency as a claim on products or services produced by the issuer.

== Critiques ==
In the &quot;Handbook of Creativity&quot;, Robert J. Sternberg writes,Equally damaging to the scientific study of creativity, in our view, has been the takeover of the field, in the popular mind, by those who follow what might be referred to as a pragmatic approach. Those taking this approach have been concerned primarily with developing creativity, secondarily with understanding it, but almost not at all with testing the validity of their ideas about it. [...] Perhaps the foremost proponent of this approach is Edward De Bono, whose work on lateral thinking and other aspects of creativity has had what appears to be considerable commercial success.

&quot;Frameworks For Thinking&quot; is an evaluation of 42 popular thinking frameworks conducted by a team of researchers. Regarding Edward de Bono they write, [he] is more interested in the usefulness of developing ideas than proving the reliability or efficacy of his approach. There is sparse research evidence to show that generalised improvements in thinking performance can be attributed to training in the use of CoRT [Cognitive Research Trust] or Thinking Hats tools. An early evaluation of CoRT reported significant benefits for Special Educational Needs (SEN) pupils... However, in a more recent study with Australian aboriginal children (Ritchie and Edwards, 1996), little evidence of generalisation was found other than in the area of creative thinking.

Summarising de Bono&#x27;s 1985 work in &quot;Conflicts: A Better Way to Resolve Them&quot;, M. Afzalur Rahim, distinguished professor of management at Western Kentucky University with a particular focus on conflict management in organizations, gives his view that, as pertains to Rahim&#x27;s own field of research, &quot;De Bono&#x27;s approach to total elimination of conflict is no different from the approaches of the classicists. This approach to dealing with conflict is completely out of tune with modern thinking and, therefore, unsatisfactory.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1971 de Bono married Josephine Hall-White. They had two sons, Caspar and Charlie, and later divorced. His will, published after his death, named two more children, another son, Francis Edward de Bono, also known as Edward de Bono, the son of Magdalena Szekely, and a daughter, Juliana Pars.

De Bono regularly visited Australia and in 1995 acquired Little Green Island, a private island of located off of Shoal Point, Queensland, from businesswoman Janet Holmes à Court. He subsequently constructed a retreat hosting corporate seminars and &quot;think tank&quot; events. De Bono owned four private islands in total, also including Reklusia Cay in the Bahamas, West Skeam Island in Ireland, and Tessera in Italy&#x27;s Venetian Lagoon. In a 2003 interview he observed &quot;I just like islands, that&#x27;s all&quot;, and compared owning an island to having &quot;your own principality, territory and psychological space&quot;.

De Bono was awarded honorary degrees from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, and the University of Dundee. Asteroid 2541 Edebono discovered by Luboš Kohoutek is named after him. Three years after De Bono died, a middle school in Handaq named the school after him, using the legacy of lateral thinking.

<doc id="381470" wikidata="Q3064239" url="?curid=381470" title="Factory Showroom">
<text>Factory Showroom is the sixth studio album by the American alternative rock band They Might Be Giants, released in 1996 by Elektra Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album to be produced by Pat Dillett, who would go on to work with the band on all subsequent albums, as well as their first album to feature a second guitarist, Eric Schermerhorn. 

Two years after &quot;Factory Showroom&quot;&#x27;s release, John Flansburgh cited the album as his favorite by the duo. Feeling that Elektra did not do enough to promote the album, among other disputes, They Might Be Giants left the label after its release.

&quot;Factory Showroom&quot; was released on vinyl for the first time in March 2012 by Asbestos Records.

==Song notes==
* &quot;I Can Hear You&quot; was recorded at the Edison Laboratory on a wax cylinder phonograph without the use of electricity.
* &quot;New York City&quot; is a cover of a song by the band Cub.
* &quot;James K. Polk&quot; is a song about James Knox Polk, the 11th President of the United States. A sparser, drum machine driven version had previously appeared on the &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot; EP (1990). It features singing saw by Julian Koster.
* The hidden track (track 0) on the CD entitled &quot;Token Back to Brooklyn&quot; is accessible by rewinding from the beginning of track 1 (&quot;S-E-X-X-Y&quot;), and is not playable on all CD players. It can also be heard on the Internet-only album &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot; (1999) and the rarities compilation &quot;They Got Lost&quot; (2002).
* A cassette version of the album that claimed to be a &quot;promotional item&quot; from Elektra was leaked by an unknown source. Along with most songs from the standard release (including &quot;Token Back to Brooklyn&quot; but excluding &quot;I Can Hear You&quot;), this version also included recordings of &quot;On the Drag&quot; and &quot;Older&quot; that have not reappeared on an official release, as well as &quot;Sensurround&quot;, &quot;Counterfeit Faker&quot;, &quot;Certain People I Could Name&quot;, &quot;Unforgotten&quot;, &quot;Reprehensible&quot;, &quot;They Got Lost&quot;, and &quot;Rat Patrol&quot;. All of these tracks were outtakes from the &quot;Factory Showroom&quot; sessions and were eventually released on either the &quot;S-E-X-X-Y&quot; EP (1996), &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot;, or &quot;They Got Lost&quot;.

<text>Richard Harding Davis (April 18, 1864 – April 11, 1916) was an American journalist and writer of fiction and drama, known foremost as the first American war correspondent to cover the Spanish–American War, the Second Boer War, and World War I. His writing greatly assisted the political career of Theodore Roosevelt. He also played a major role in the evolution of the American magazine. His influence extended to the world of fashion, and he is credited with making the clean-shaven look popular among men at the turn of the 20th century.

==Biography==
Davis was born on April 18, 1864, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His mother Rebecca Harding Davis was a prominent writer. His father, Lemuel Clarke Davis, was himself a journalist and edited the &quot;Philadelphia Public Ledger&quot;. As a young man, Davis attended the Episcopal Academy. In 1882, after an unhappy year at Swarthmore College, Davis transferred to Lehigh University, where his uncle, H. Wilson Harding, was a professor. While at Lehigh, Davis published his first book, &quot;The Adventures of My Freshman&quot; (1884), a collection of short stories. Many of the stories had originally appeared in the student magazine the &quot;Lehigh Burr&quot;. In 1885, Davis transferred to Johns Hopkins University.

After college, his father helped him gain his first position as a journalist at the &quot;Philadelphia Record&quot;, but he was soon dismissed. After another brief position at the &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot;, Davis accepted a better-paying position at the &quot;New York Evening Sun&quot; where he gained attention for his flamboyant style and his writing on controversial subjects such as abortion, suicide and execution. He first attracted attention in May to June 1889, by reporting on the devastation of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, following the destructive flood. He added to his reputation by reporting on other noteworthy events such as the first electrocution of a criminal (the execution of William Kemmler in 1890).

Davis became a managing editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, and was one of the world&#x27;s leading war correspondents at the time of the Second Boer War in South Africa. As an American, he had the opportunity to see the war first-hand from both the British and Boer perspectives. Davis also worked as a reporter for the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, and &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

He was popular among a number of leading writers of his time, and is considered the model for illustrator Charles Dana Gibson&#x27;s dashing &quot;Gibson man&quot;, the male equivalent of his famous Gibson Girl. He is mentioned early in Sinclair Lewis&#x27; book &quot;Dodsworth&quot; as the example of an exciting, adventure-seeking legitimate hero.

Davis had success with his 1897 novel &quot;Soldiers of Fortune&quot;, which he turned into a play written by Augustus Thomas. His novel was filmed twice, in 1914 and in 1919 by Allan Dwan. The 1914 version starring Dustin Farnum was shot in the Cuban locations that Davis used in his novel, and Davis was present during the filming.

During the Spanish–American War, Davis was on a United States Navy warship when he witnessed the shelling of Matanzas, Cuba, a part of the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. His story made headlines, but as a result, the Navy prohibited reporters from being aboard any American naval vessel for the rest of the war.
Davis was a good friend of Theodore Roosevelt, and he helped create the legend surrounding the Rough Riders, of which he was made an honorary member. Some have even gone so far to accuse Davis of involvement in William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s alleged plot to have started the war between Spain and the United States in order to boost newspaper sales; however, Davis refused to work for Hearst after a dispute over fictionalizing one of his articles.
Despite his alleged association with yellow journalism, his writings of life and travel in Central America, Venezuela, the Caribbean, Rhodesia and South Africa during the Second Boer War were widely published. He was one of many war correspondents who covered the Russo-Japanese War from the perspective of the Japanese forces.

Davis later reported on the Salonika front of the First World War, where he was arrested by the Germans as a spy, but released.

==Personal life==
Davis was married twice, first to Cecil Clark, an artist, in 1899, and, following their 1912 divorce, to Bessie McCoy, an actress and vaudeville performer, who is remembered for her signature &quot;Yama Yama Man&quot; routine. Davis and Bessie had a daughter, Hope.

Davis died of a heart attack on April 11, 1916, while on the telephone. It was seven days before his 52nd birthday. He was interred at Leverington Cemetery in Philadelphia. His friend and fellow author John Fox, Jr. was surprised by his sudden death, writing, &quot;He was so intensely alive that I cannot think of him as dead—and I do not. He is just away on another of those trips and it really seems queer that I shall not hear him tell about it.&quot; His wife Bessie would also die young, at age 42 in 1931 from intestinal problems.

==Legacy==

A plaque denoting his boyhood home can be seen at 21st and Chancellor Streets in Philadelphia.

Davis&#x27;s &quot;Gallegher and Other Stories&quot; became the series &quot;Gallegher&quot;, starring Roger Mobley, Edmond O&#x27;Brien, and Harvey Korman on &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; on NBC.

<text>Mount Kailash (also Kailasa; Kangrinboqê or &quot;Gang Rinpoche&quot;; ; ; , ) is a mountain in Ngari Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region of China. It lies in the Kailash Range (Gangdisê Mountains) of the Transhimalaya, in the western part of the Tibetan Plateau. The peak of Mount Kailash is located at an elevation of , near the western trijunction between China, India and Nepal.

Mount Kailash is located close to Manasarovar and Rakshastal lakes. The sources of four rivers: Indus, Sutlej, Brahmaputra, and Karnali lie in the vicinity of the region. Mount Kailash is sacred in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Bon religion. People from India, China, Nepal and other countries in the region undertake a pilgrimage to the mountain. The pilgrimage generally involves trekking towards Lake Mansarovar and a circumambulation of Mount Kailash.

While the mountain has been surveyed by climbers in the past, there has been no recorded successful ascent of the mountain. The climbing of the mountain is prohibited by the Chinese government due to its religious significance.

== Etymology ==
The mountain is known as &quot;&#x27;&quot; (; var. &#x27; ) in Sanskrit. The name could have been derived from the word &quot;&quot; (), which means &quot;crystal&quot;.

In his Tibetan-English dictionary, Sarat Chandra Das states that &#x27;kai la ca&#x27; () from Sanskrit is used to denote the mountain. The mountain is also called as &quot;Gang Rinpoche&quot; (Tibetan: གངས་རིན་པོ་ཆེ་; ) or &quot;Gang Tise&quot; locally. &quot;Gang Rinpoche&quot; means &quot;snow jewel mountain&quot; with &quot;Kang&quot; (or &quot;Gang&quot;) being the Tibetan word meaning &quot;white mountain&quot; (snow peak) and &quot;rinpoche&quot; is an honorific meaning &quot;precious one&quot;. &quot;Gang Tise&quot; means &quot;mountain of ice or cool&quot;.

== Geography and topography ==
Mount Kailash is located in Ngari Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region of China. It lies in the Gangdisê Mountains (also called as Kailash Range) of the Transhimalaya, in the western part of the Tibetan Plateau. The peak of Mount Kailash is at an elevation of . The region is located north of the western tripoint of the border between China, India and Nepal.

The major rivers rising from the western Gangdise mountains are the Yarlung Tsangpo (which becomes the Brahmaputra), the Indus, the Sutlej and the Karnali, a tributary of Ganges. All these river systems originate within a stretch in the region. Mount Kailash is located on the banks of Manasarovar and Rakshastal lakes. Spread over an area of , Manasarovar is the highest freshwater lake in the world.

=== Geology ===
The region around Mount Kailash are remnants of large ice sheets that covered the region during the Quaternary period, the last of which retreated about 10,000 years ago. The mountain might be a large metasedimentary roof pendant supported by a base of granite. The Indus headwaters area is typified by wide-scale faulting of metamorphosed late-Cretaceous to mid-Cenozoic sedimentary rocks interspersed with igneous Cenozoic granitic rocks. The Cenozoic rocks represent offshore marine limestones deposited before subduction of the Tethys oceanic crust. These sediments were deposited on the southern margin of the Asia block during subduction of the Tethys oceanic crust before the collision between the Indian and Asian continents. It also consists of sand dunes covering late Eocene volcanic forms interspersed with Cretaceous and Eocene sediments.

The Kailash flysch zone extends about from the mountain and marks the northern end of the Himalayas and the start of the Trans Himalayas. The Trans Himalayan range was formed by the subduction of sediments from the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. The flysch zone consists of alternate areas of peridotites, sandy shales, and dolomites, covered by gravel terraces. The mountain itself consists of thick conglomerate rocks sitting on granite. The visible part of the conglomerates extend from to the top with the base located deeper in the mountain.

=== Climate ===
The weather is fairly dry during April to June with day time temperatures of and night time temperatures of . The temperature starts to decrease in October and winters have much lower day time temperatures ranging from and further lower in the night reaching up to with January being the coldest. Monsoons bring rain from late June to August with cold winds.

Global warming is described as happening three times faster (by about 0.3 C per decade) on the Tibetan Plateau than anywhere else in the world with lesser snowfall in the winter. According to locals, the land around Mount Kailash has been growing warmer in recent years with winters not as cold as it used to be. The retreating glaciers and thawing of the permafrost in the Tibet region might lead to uncertain effects on water resources of the region. These effects along with population explosion and tourism has put severe stress on the fragile ecosystem around Mount Kailash.

The intergovernmental organisation International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) is involved in a trans boundary project called the Kailash Sacred Landscape Conservation and Development Initiative in the region around Mount Kailash. The organization is involved in ongoing efforts to generate climate data, and to devise sustainable ways of life for the people of the region.

== Mountaineering ==
In 1926, Hugh Ruttledge, the deputy commissioner of Almora, visited the area to meet the Garpon (local Tibetan leader) of Ngari. As the Garpon was away, he circumambulated Mount Kailash while studying it. As per Ruttledge, the mountain was about high and utterly unclimbable. He thought about an ascent along the northeast ridge and had been exploring the area with Colonel R. C. Wilson, who was on the other side of the mountain with a Sherpa named Tseten. As per Wilson, Tseten told him that the southeast ridge represented a feasible route to the summit. Wilson explained that although they attempted to climb the mountain, they ran into heavy snowfall, making the ascent impossible.

Herbert Tichy visited the area in 1936, attempting to climb the mountain. When he asked the local people whether Kailash was climbable, a Garpon replied: &quot;Only a man entirely free of sin could climb Kailash. And he wouldn&#x27;t have to actually scale the sheer walls of ice to do it — he&#x27;d just turn himself into a bird and fly to the summit&quot;. Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner was given the opportunity by the Chinese government to climb the mountain in the mid-1980s, but he reportedly declined, saying &quot;If we conquer this mountain, then we conquer something in people&#x27;s souls. I would suggest they go and climb something a little harder.&quot; In 2001, permission was denied to a Spanish team, who requested to climb the peak. Chinese authorities stated that any climbing activities on Mount Kailash were strictly prohibited. , there have been no known successful ascents of the mountain.

== Religious significance ==
Mount Kailash is considered sacred in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Bon religions.

=== Hinduism ===
In Hindu art and literature, the mountain is described as the abode of Shiva, who is depicted as residing there along with his consort Parvati and their children, Ganesha and Kartikeya. In early Hindu depictions, Kailash was described as one of the mountains in the Himalayas. In Hindu mythology, Mount Meru is considered as a stairway to heaven, where the devas reside and the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; states that it lies in the center of the world surrounded by six mountain ranges similar to a lotus, one of which is the Himalayas. In the later Hindu theology, Kailash came to be identified with Meru. Shiva is described as sitting in a lotus position, engaged in meditation within the confines of the mountain. Kailash and Mansarovar are mentioned in the Hindu epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. According to the Hindu scriptures and sculptural depictions, the demon-king Ravana shook the mountain after he was refused entry to Kailash. This enraged Shiva, who pressed his toe upon the mountain, trapping Ravana in between. Ravana sang hymns in praise of Shiva for a thousand years before he was released. This representation of Shiva is also referred to as Ravananugraha (meaning &quot;form showing favour to Ravana&quot;).

=== Jainism ===
According to Jain scriptures, Rishabhadeva, the first Tirthankar of Jainism attained moksha (liberation) on Mount Kailash. It is believed by Jains that after Rishabhadeva attained moksha, his son emperor Bharata Chakravartin had constructed three stupas and twenty four shrines of the 24 tirthankaras in the region with their idols studded with precious stones and named it &quot;Sinhnishdha&quot;. He also performed a fortnight of worship termed &quot;Mahamaga&quot; and attained moksha from Kailash. Large pits were dug around the mountain later and the River Ganges was made to flow through it. The 24th and the last Tirthankara, Mahavira, was taken to the summit of Meru by Indra shortly after his birth, after putting his mother into deep slumber. There he was anointed with precious unctions.

=== Buddhism and Bon ===
As per Buddhist texts, Mount Kailash (Kailasa) is known as the mythological Mount Meru. Kailash is central to its cosmology, and a major pilgrimage site for some Buddhist traditions. In Buddhism, Kailash represents the father of the world and lake Mansarovar symbolizes the mother. Numerous sites in the region are associated with Padmasambhava, who is credited with establishing Tantric Buddhism in Tibet in the 8th century CE. Vajrayana Buddhists believe that saint Milarepa () had a challenge with Naro Böncham, a follower of Bön religion of Tibet. The two engaged in a battle of wits with neither able to gain a decisive advantage. Finally, it was agreed that whoever could reach the summit of Kailash first would be the victor. While Naro sat on his magic drum to climb up the slope, Milarepa reached the summit riding on the rays of the Sun, thus winning the contest. He also gave the nearby mountain, since known as &quot;Bönri&quot; bequeathing it to Bön.

For the Bon people, the mountain is the abode of sky goddess Sipaimen and the mountain was the centre of the ancient Bon empire of Zhang Zhung. As per Tibetan beliefs, the mountain was the centre of the universe &quot;Mandala&quot; and the source of the mythical Lion, Horse, Peacock, and Elephant Rivers which flowed in the four cardinal directions.

== Pilgrimage ==
Due to its perceived sacredness to various religions, people undertake a pilgrimage called &quot;yatra&quot; to the mountain. While it is not known when the first pilgrimage started, it is one of the oldest pilgrimage routes, which has been in existence for many years.

Pilgrimage to the mountain increased in the 1930s but was affected later due to both China and the British Empire claiming the region. Religious pilgrimages to Mount Kailas and Manasarovar were permitted by China after its occupation of Tibet in 1950-51. While pilgrimage from India was guaranteed by the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement, access was restricted after the subsequent 1959 Tibetan uprising and the borders were closed after the Sino-Indian War in 1962. After nearly two decades, pilgrimage from India was allowed in 1981 after an agreement between the governments of India and China. The pilgrimage was suspended for three years since 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The route was re-opened in 2023 with new regulations.

Since the reopening of the pilgrimage route from India in 1981, the numbers of pilgrims going on the annual yatra has grown considerably. Before the closure in 2020, several thousand pilgrims from India were going to this pilgrimage every year. Since 2015, aspiring pilgrims from India were required to apply in advance to the Ministry of External Affairs and specific number of passes were issued to pilgrims by computerized random selection with preference given to first timers. In India, the pilgrimage is organized by the Government of India and is permitted between June and September. Pilgrims from India travel through two routes opened for the purpose with border crossings at Lipu Lekh pass in Uttarakhand and the Nathu La pass in Sikkim. Since 2020, a motorable road is available till the Lipu Lekh pass through the Indian side of the Mahakali valley, before crossing over to China. The Nathu La route was opened in 2015 and involves traveling to Gangtok before crossing the Nathu La pass into China.

Since 2015, the pilgrimage from Nepal is generally done from the nearby Humla district in northwestern Nepal. The April 2015 Nepal Earthquake resulted in the closure of the border crossing at Tatopani-Zangmu. Pilgrims also pray to Mount Kailash from within Nepal where it is visible from the Lapcha La pass above the Limi valley on a clear day. Another route exists through the crossing at Rasuwa-Gyirong. Pilgrims could reach Lhasa by air before the journey to Lake Manasarovar or Darchen.

The pilgrimage involves trekking towards Lake Mansarovar and a circumambulation of Mount Kailash. The path around Mount Kailash is long. The circumambulation is made in a clockwise direction by Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains, while Bönpos circumambulate the mountain in a counterclockwise direction. The circumambulation usually begins and ends at Darchen, a small outpost located at an elevation of with the highest point at the Drölma pass situated at . Trekking around the mountain can be done on foot with support from a pony or domestic yak. The circumambulation takes three days on average with the first day trek from Darchen to Dirapuk gompa for about , followed by a journey from Dirpauk to Zutulphuk via the Drölma pass for on the second day and the final trek back to Darchen on the last day. The most extreme method of doing the circumambulation (called &quot;Kora&quot;) in Tibetan Buddhism is performed by doing full body-length prostrations over the entire stretch around the mountain. The pilgrim bends down, kneels, prostrates full-length, makes a mark with her fingers, rises to her knees, prays, and then crawls forward on hands and knees to the mark made by her fingers before repeating the process. With this method, the pilgrimage takes three weeks on average to complete.

Pilgrims believe that doing a circumambulation of Mount Kailash is a spiritually beneficial practice that can bring various positive effects, such as the cleansing of one&#x27;s sins. Each circumambulation is considered to have fulfilled a life-death cycle. There are many stupas, flag poles, Buddhist monasteries and praying stations along the route. Many of the cultural artifacts along the route were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution of China from 1966 to 1976. Hindus take a ritual bath in the Manasarovar before doing circumambulation. Hindu text &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; states that &quot;There are no mountains like the Himalaya, for in them are Kailas and Mansarovar. As the dew is dried up by the morning Sun, so are the sins of mankind dried up by the sight of the Himalaya.&quot;

Tibetan Buddhist pilgrims often chant &quot;om mani padme hum&quot; (jewel in the lotus) and sing &quot;nyelu&quot; songs while crossing the Dolma La pass which are believe to proclaim a fraternity amongst all pilgrims who cross paths on a Kailash pilgrimage. As the mountain is located in a remote area of the Himalayas, very few facilities exist to aid during the pilgrimage. For varied reasons for the different faiths that revere the mountain, setting foot on the slopes of the mountain or attempting to climb it is forbidden by law.

<text>Iron Eyes Cody (born Espera Oscar de Corti, April 3, 1904 – January 4, 1999) was an American actor of Italian descent who portrayed Native Americans in Hollywood films, including the role of Chief Iron Eyes in Bob Hope&#x27;s &quot;The Paleface&quot; (1948). He also played a Native American shedding a tear about pollution in one of the country&#x27;s most well-known television public service announcements from the group Keep America Beautiful. Living in Hollywood, he began to insist, even in his private life, that he was Native American, over time claiming membership in several different tribes. In 1996, Cody&#x27;s half-sister said that he was of Italian ancestry, but he denied it. After his death, it was revealed that he was of Sicilian parentage and not Native American at all.

==Early life==
Cody was born Espera Oscar de Corti on April 3, 1904, in Kaplan in Vermilion Parish, in southwestern Louisiana, a second son of Francesca Salpietra from Sicily and her husband, Antonio de Corti from southern Italy. He had two brothers, Joseph and Frank, and a sister, Victoria. His parents had a local grocery store in Gueydan, Louisiana, where he grew up. His father left the family and moved to Texas, where he took the name Tony Corti. His mother married Alton Abshire and had five more children with him.

When the three de Corti brothers were teenagers, they joined their father in Texas and shortened their last name from de Corti to Corti. Cody&#x27;s father, Tony Corti, died in Texas in 1924. The brothers moved on to California, where they were acting in movies, and changed their surname to Cody. Joseph William and Frank Henry Cody worked as extras, then moved on to other work. Frank was killed by a hit-and-run driver in 1949.

==Career==
Cody began acting in the late 1920s. He worked in film and television until his death. Cody claimed his father was Cherokee and his mother Cree, also naming several different tribes, and frequently changing his claimed place of birth. To those unfamiliar with Indigenous American or First Nations cultures and people, he gave the appearance of living as if he were Native American, fulfilling the stereotypical expectations by wearing his film wardrobe as daily clothing—including braided wig, fringed leathers and beaded moccasins—at least when photographers were visiting, and in other ways continuing to play the same Hollywood-scripted roles off-screen as well as on.

He appeared in more than 200 films, including &quot;The Big Trail&quot; (1930), with John Wayne; &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1934), with Colleen Moore; &quot;Sitting Bull&quot; (1954), as Crazy Horse; &quot;The Light in the Forest&quot; (1958) as Cuyloga; &quot;The Great Sioux Massacre&quot; (1965), with Joseph Cotten; &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; (1966), with Steve McQueen; &quot;A Man Called Horse&quot; (1970), with Richard Harris; and &quot;Ernest Goes to Camp&quot; (1987) as Chief St. Cloud, with Jim Varney.

He also appeared in over a hundred television programs. In 1953, he appeared twice in Duncan Renaldo&#x27;s syndicated television series, &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; as Chief Sky Eagle. He guest starred on the NBC western series, &quot;The Restless Gun&quot;, starring John Payne, and &quot;The Tall Man&quot;, with Barry Sullivan and Clu Gulager. In 1961, he played the title role in &quot;The Burying of Sammy Hart&quot; on the ABC western series, &quot;The Rebel&quot;, starring Nick Adams. A close friend of Walt Disney, Cody appeared in a Disney studio serial titled &quot;The First Americans&quot;, and in episodes of &quot;The Mountain Man&quot;, &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; and &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;. In 1964 Cody appeared as Chief Black Feather on &quot;The Virginian&quot; episode &quot;The Intruders&quot;. He played Seeba in S8 E26 &quot;The Jarbo Pierce Story&quot; on &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, 1965.

Cody was widely seen as the &quot;Crying Indian&quot; in the &quot;Keep America Beautiful&quot; public service announcements (PSA) in the early 1970s. The environmental commercial, first aired on Earth Day in 1971, depicted Cody in a Plains Indians/Hollywood Indian-style costume, shedding a tear after trash is thrown from the window of a car and it lands at his feet. The announcer, William Conrad, says: &quot;People start pollution; people can stop it.&quot; The ad won two Clio awards, incited a frenzy of community involvement, and &quot;helped reduce litter by 88% across 38 states&quot;, according to one reliable source. Cody was a participant in the documentary series &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1980), where he discussed early Western filmmaker William S. Hart&#x27;s use of Plains Indian Sign Language.

The Joni Mitchell song &quot;Lakota&quot;, from the 1988 album, &quot;Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm&quot;, features Cody&#x27;s chanting. He made a cameo appearance in the 1990 film &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
In 1936, Cody married archaeologist Bertha Parker (Abenaki and Seneca descent). She was active in excavations during the late 1920s and early 1930s before becoming an assistant in archaeology at the Southwest Museum. They adopted two children said to be of Dakota-Maricopa origin, Robert Tree Cody and Arthur. The couple remained married until Bertha&#x27;s death in 1978.

Although the non-Native public who knew him from the movies and television thought of Cody as a Native American, a 1996 story by &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; in New Orleans questioned his heritage, reporting that he was a second-generation Italian-American. This was based on an interview with his half-sister, and documents including a baptismal record. Cody, who now wore his Hollywood costumes in daily life, denied the claim.

Cody died at the age of 94 from mesothelioma at home in Los Angeles on January 4, 1999. Before death, he had written this comment:
&quot;Make me ready to stand before you with clean and straight eyes. When life fades, as the fading sunset, may our spirits stand before you without shame.&quot;

==Honors==
On April 20, 1983, he was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6601 Hollywood Boulevard.

In 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

<text>Messiah University is a private interdenominational evangelical Christian university in Upper Allen Township, Pennsylvania, near Mechanicsburg.

==History==
The school was founded as &quot;Messiah Bible School and Missionary Training Home&quot; in 1909 by the Brethren in Christ Church. Originally located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in the home of Messiah&#x27;s first president, Samuel Rogers (S.R.) Smith, a local businessman and leader in the Brethren in Christ Church, the school was moved to Grantham in 1911, following the construction of the campus&#x27; first building, Old Main. (The university now uses a Mechanicsburg mailing address, but its main campus is still located in Grantham.) The building was constructed on land donated by S.R. Smith, who had moved his home and various business interests outside of the city to allow for growth in the farmlands surrounding Grantham. In the early years, the school offered a high school curriculum and several Bible programs. By 1921, it had also become a junior college, making it the second junior college in Pennsylvania, and changed its name to &quot;Messiah Bible School&quot;. The campus covers 375 acres.

By the 1950s, the school offered four-year college programs and accordingly in 1951 it changed its name to &quot;Messiah College&quot;. Messiah discontinued its high school program in 1959 and added liberal arts programs during this period. It was accredited as a four-year college in 1963, and continued to expand its liberal arts programs.

In 1964, Messiah College took over the operations of &quot;Upland College&quot; in Upland, California, a Brethren in Christ Church college that had been operating since the 1920s. The Upland campus was closed and all operations were consolidated to Pennsylvania. Four years later, Messiah College opened its Philadelphia Campus in a partnership with Temple University. This campus closed at the end of the Spring 2014 semester.
In 2002, Messiah College&#x27;s Harrisburg Institute was founded in downtown Harrisburg. Its purpose was to serve as an academic and research center and connect students with the unique needs of an urban environment. The institute also provided housing for up to 25 students.

Following the US Justice Department Scandal involving alumna Monica Goodling in 2007, several members of the media ridiculed Messiah College. Jon Stewart on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; referred to Messiah as a school &quot;where people have faith that they&#x27;ll receive a quality education, and yet somehow it never arrives,&quot; and &quot;that everyone in the God business knows (Messiah) is a &#x27;savior school&#x27;.&quot; Bill Maher also mocked Messiah, calling it &quot;the home of the Fighting Christies.&quot;

Even though it is no longer owned by the Brethren in Christ Church, Messiah continues to be influenced by its traditions, primarily in the Anabaptist, but also the Radical Pietist and Wesleyan holiness movements. Today, it is a nondenominational Christian college, with a faith base that is broadly evangelical and includes students and employees from a variety of denominations and Christian faith traditions.

In July 2020, Messiah College became Messiah University.

===2008 Compassion Forum===
The Compassion Forum was a question-and-answer session hosted by Messiah in which CNN commentators Jon Meacham and Campbell Brown as well as select members of the audience posed questions about Faith and Politics to Democratic political candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. The forum took place on April 13, 2008, and was given live national coverage by CNN. The event was organized by the religious organization Faith in Public Life. John McCain was invited to participate in the event but declined the invitation, citing a schedule conflict.

==Academics==
Messiah University offers more than 150 undergraduate majors, minors, concentrations, teaching certificates and pre-professional advising options in two schools: the School of Arts, Culture and Society; and the School of Science, Engineering and Health. In addition to major requirements, there is a general education curriculum, required for all students. General education requirements include but are not limited to one or more classes in theology, philosophy, literature, social sciences, art, world views, and physical education. Students are also required to take first year and senior seminars.

Messiah University awards Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in the liberal and applied arts and sciences. Specialized programs include extensive off-campus study, individualized majors, independent study, service-learning, internships, allied health programs in partnership with other institutions and a College Honors Program. Some majors allow students to graduate one or two semesters early, depending on their particular field of study.

In 2009, Messiah University launched its first graduate programs, and currently offers master&#x27;s programs. It also offers certificate programs along with an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship program.

Messiah University students have earned academic honors and fellowships such as Rhodes, Fulbright, Carnegie, Truman and Boren scholarships. Joy Yu-Ho Wang became Messiah University&#x27;s first Rhodes Scholar in 1997.

Messiah University&#x27;s academic year is divided into Fall and Spring Terms. The January Term, or J-Term, was a three-and-a-half-week period where students could choose to take one course intensively, participate in a cross cultural study program or simply stay home for an extended vacation. J-Term was discontinued in 2021. 

The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Academic programs in engineering, dietetics, nursing, athletic training, music, social work, education, theater, business, art and design, counseling and occupational therapy are each accredited by professional associations.

===International programs===
In 2015, the institution was ranked 25th among all undergraduate institutions in the country that send students to study abroad by the Institute for International Education&#x27;s Open Doors Report. In 2014–2015, more than 500 Messiah students earned academic credit by studying abroad in more than 40 different countries.
Cross-cultural courses are offered during May term. These trips are led by faculty members, and students earn credits by participating in an intense three-week study of a particular geographic region or culture. Messiah University students can also participate in the International Business Institute (IBI), an overseas program in international economics and business designed to give students an opportunity to integrate academic study with international field experience. Students who travel with IBI during the summer visit corporate headquarters, manufacturing plants, and government and international agencies across Europe and Asia. Students can also work in a variety of fields through an international internship.

==Athletics==
The Messiah University Falcons compete in NCAA Division III athletics with 22 intercollegiate athletic teams. Messiah is a member of the Middle Atlantic Conferences. The Messiah University mascot is the Falcon, which was given the name Fandango in 2006. Through the Senior Class Gift from the Class of 2017, the mascot changed his look and was renamed to Flex. Their local rival is Elizabethtown College.

Messiah&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer teams both won the NCAA Division III National Championship in 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2012. The Falcons men&#x27;s soccer team are eleven-time national champions, winning the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division III Soccer Championship in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017. Messiah&#x27;s women&#x27;s soccer team has won the NCAA Division III Women&#x27;s Soccer Championship in 2005, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2019. Messiah University is the only college in the NCAA to win both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer national championship in the same year, and they have achieved that distinction four times (in 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2012). The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track &amp; field teams have won 11 individual NCAA Division III National Championships. In 2010, Messiah was ranked by U.S. News &amp; World Report as the third best school in the nation for soccer fans.

The women&#x27;s softball team won their first NCAA Division III national championship in 2009.

The women&#x27;s field hockey team won their first NCAA Division III National Championship in 2016.

The men&#x27;s wrestling team has won five individual NCAA Division III National Championships. The team finished as the national runner-up in 2016.

In 2017 Tim Moses became the first-ever NCAA Division III men&#x27;s pole vaulter to earn All-American honors in every indoor and outdoor season (eight total).

==Spiritual life==

===Community Covenant===
Students at Messiah University are required to sign a Community Covenant upon entering. The document states that every person is created in the image of God, and that there are certain responsibilities of living in community that must also be assumed in relation to God, others, and his creation.

The Community Covenant affirms belief in God and the Bible. The Covenant requires commitment to academic integrity, responsible decision making in light of Christian values, and balancing personal freedom with concern for others. The Covenant bans both on- and off-campus the use of illegal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco as well as gambling, profanity, &quot;occult practices,&quot; sexual intercourse outside of marriage, and &quot;same-sex sexual expression.&quot; It also prescribes the avoidance of drunkenness, stealing, and dishonesty. The covenant also prohibits certain attitudes, such as greed, lust, and jealousy, but allows that these attributes are typically expressed less outwardly.

====LGBT prohibition====
Messiah&#x27;s student handbook prohibits &quot;same-sex sexual expression&quot; including identifying as a couple or expressing physical intimacy, although heterosexual couples are specifically allowed to do these things by the handbook. Unlike many religious schools with a similar policy, Messiah has never requested a Title IX exemption for permission to discriminate against LGBT students.

The university&#x27;s stance on homosexuality, as stated in the Community Covenant, has been a source of contention and controversy amongst the student body, administration, and alumni. A number of articles have been published concerning the issue in the university&#x27;s student newspaper, the &quot;Swinging Bridge&quot;, as well as in local media.

An alumni group, Inclusive Alumni, was formed in support of Isaiah Thomas and aimed at changing the institution&#x27;s policy. Isaiah Thomas was a student who decided to transfer out of Messiah in May 2011, after claims of harassment by students and also a professor. He also claims he received a death threat via Facebook. He claims that the institution said that they followed up on his claims but refused to change the policy.

===Chapel===
Undergraduate students at Messiah University are required to attend 14 chapel services each semester.

In addition to chapel services, Messiah University provides discipleship groups, ministry outreach teams, community service, mission trips and other special programs such as &quot;Powerhouse,&quot; a weekly student-led contemporary worship service.

==Student activities==
Students at Messiah University can spend their free time playing in intramural sports leagues, participating in various clubs, watching on-campus movies, and hanging out at local diners, among other things. Underclassmen also participate in floor activities organized by their RAs. The Student Government Association funds 60+ organizations on campus that aim at providing for a co-curricular atmosphere conducive to a holistic education and enjoyable experience while enrolled at Messiah. The SGA also provides students with unique access towards influencing governance and overall institutional prerogatives.

Messiah University&#x27;s Student Activities Board (SAB) is an executive organization that attempts to help students engage with popular culture by bringing different concerts, films, and other forms of entertainment to campus. In recent years, Messiah University has, through SAB, hosted such musicians and bands as Bob Dylan, Counting Crows, Katy Perry, Chiddy Bang, Fun., Jack&#x27;s Mannequin, Ingrid Michaelson, Mat Kearney, Owl City, Brand New, Guster, Janelle Monáe, Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band, Anberlin, Nickel Creek, White Rabbits, The Decemberists, Regina Spektor, Iron &amp; Wine, M. Ward, The Low Anthem, Mates of State, Exit Clov, Feist, Wilco, Rosie Thomas, Copeland, mewithoutYou, Phantom Planet, Erin McKeown, Rilo Kiley, 4th Avenue Jones, Lifehouse, Jon Bellion, Johnnyswim, Jason Mraz, Josh Ritter, Magic, 21 Pilots, Colony House, Smallpools, NF, Lecrae, Ben Rector, and VERITE, and as well as Christian artists Needtobreathe, Andy Mineo, Relient K, Jeff Deyo, August Burns Red, Jars of Clay, Cross Movement, Matt Wertz and Out of Eden, among others. They also plan dances, coffeehouses, cultural engagement and other special activities (like outings, Broadway trips, and festivals) for students. SAB hosts a free concert series throughout the semester, held in the Larsen Student Union building. Local, indie and up-and-coming bands and artists play throughout the school year. These concerts are free not only to students, but to the public as well.

<text>Roman Stanisław Dmowski (9 August 1864 – 2 January 1939) was a Polish politician, statesman, and co-founder and chief ideologue of the National Democracy (abbreviated &quot;ND&quot;: in Polish, &quot;Endecja&quot;) political movement. He saw the Germanization of Polish territories controlled by the German Empire as the major threat to Polish culture and therefore advocated a degree of accommodation with another power that had partitioned Poland, the Russian Empire. He favoured the re-establishment of Polish independence by nonviolent means and supported policies favourable to the Polish middle class. While in Paris during World War I, he was a prominent spokesman for Polish aspirations to the Allies through his Polish National Committee. He was an instrumental figure in the postwar restoration of Poland&#x27;s independent existence. Throughout most of his life, he was the chief ideological opponent of the Polish military and political leader Józef Piłsudski and of the latter&#x27;s vision of Poland as a multinational federation against German and Russian imperialism.

Dmowski never wielded significant political power except for a brief period in 1923 as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Nevertheless, he was one of the most influential Polish ideologues and politicians of his time. A controversial personality most of his life, Dmowski desired a homogeneous, Polish-speaking and Roman Catholic-practicing nation as opposed to Piłsudski&#x27;s vision of Prometheism, which sought a multi-ethnic Poland reminiscent of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. As a result, his thinking marginalized other ethnic groups living in Poland, particularly those in the Kresy (which included Jews, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians), and he was regarded as anti-Semitic. He remains a key figure of Polish nationalism, and has been frequently referred to as &quot;the father of Polish nationalism&quot;.

==Early life==
Dmowski was born on 9 August 1864 in Kamionek near Warsaw, in the Kingdom of Poland, which three years later became part of the Russian Empire (as Vistula Land). His father was a road construction worker and later an entrepreneur. Dmowski attended schools in Warsaw, studying biology and zoology at Warsaw University, from which he graduated in 1891. As a student he became active in the Polish Youth Association &quot;Zet&quot; (&quot;Związek Młodzieży Polskiej &quot;Zet&quot;&quot;), where he was active in opposing socialist activists. The Zet had links with the &quot;Liga Polska&quot; (Polish League), which Dmowski joined in 1889. A key concept of the League was &quot;Polskość&quot; (Polishness), as opposed to &quot;trójlojalizm&quot; (triple loyalty).

He also organized a student street demonstration on the 100th anniversary of the Polish Constitution of For this he was imprisoned by Russian Imperial authorities for five months in the Warsaw Citadel. He was then exiled to Libau and Mitau in Kurland (Latvia). After 1890 he was also developing as a writer and publicist, publishing political and literary criticism in &quot;Głos&quot;, where he became close friends with Jan Ludwik Popławski, who would be his mentor. After his release from exile, Dmowski became quite critical of the &quot;Liga Polska&quot;, accusing it of being controlled by Free Masons and being generally incompetent.

In April 1893, Dmowski co-founded the National League and became its first leader. The group differed from the &quot;Liga Polska&quot; as Dmowski insisted that there could be one Polish national identity, leading him to attack regionalism as a form of split loyalty that was weakening the Polish nation. The same concept also excluded minorities such as Jews from his projected Polish nation. In November 1893 he was sentenced to exile from the Vistula Land. Dmowski went to Jelgava, and soon afterward in early 1895 to Lemberg, Austria-Hungary (modern Lviv, Ukraine, Lwów in Polish), where together with Popławski he began to publish a new magazine, &#x27; (&quot;All-Polish Review&quot;). In 1897, he co-founded the National-Democratic Party (&quot;Stronnictwo Narodowo-Demokratyczne&quot; or &quot;Endecja&quot;). The &quot;Endecja&quot; was to serve as a political party, a lobby group and an underground organization that would unite Poles who espoused Dmowski&#x27;s views into a disciplined and committed political group. In 1899, Dmowski founded the Society for National Education as an ancillary group. From 1898 to 1900, he resided in France and Britain, and travelled to Brazil. In 1901 he took up residence in Kraków, then part of the Austrian partition of Poland. In 1903 he published a book, &#x27; (&quot;Thoughts of a Modern Pole&quot;), one of the first if not the first nationalist manifesto in European history.

In &quot;Myśli nowoczesnego Polaka&quot;, Dmowski was harshly critical of the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth for exalting the nobility and for its tolerance for minorities, which contradicted his principle of healthy &quot;national egoism&quot;. He also rejected liberalism and socialism for putting the individual above the nation-state, which for Dmowski was the only unit that really mattered. Dmowski argued that the privileged status of the aristocracy in the old Commonwealth had hindered national development, and what was needed was a strong sense of nationality that would unite the nation into one. He also attacked the Romantic nationalism of the 19th century for viewing Poland as the &quot;Christ of Nations&quot;, instead arguing for a hard-headed national egoism. Dmowski opposed revolutionary means of fighting, preferring political struggle, and aimed for independence through increased autonomy. After the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, Dmowski met with Colonel Akashi Motojiro, the Japanese military attache in Sweden and spy-master for Japanese intelligence activities, in Kraków in March 1904. Although reluctant to collaborate with the Japanese, Dmowski agreed to Akashi&#x27;s proposal that Polish soldiers in the Russian Army in Manchuria might be encouraged to defect to the Imperial Japanese Army. He travelled to Tokyo to work out the details, and at the same time made a successful effort to prevent the Japanese from aiding a rival Polish political activist, Józef Piłsudski, who wanted assistance for a planned insurrection in Poland, an aspiration which Dmowski felt would be doomed to failure.

In 1905, Dmowski moved to Warsaw, back in the Russian partition of Poland, where he continued to play a growing role in the &quot;Endecja&quot; faction. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, Dmowski favoured co-operation with the Imperial Russian authorities and welcomed Nicholas II&#x27;s October Manifesto of 1905 as a stepping stone on the road towards renewed Polish autonomy. During the revolt in Łódź in June 1905, the &quot;Endeks&quot;, acting under Dmowski&#x27;s orders, opposed the uprising led by Piłsudski&#x27;s Polish Socialist Party (PPS). During the course of the &quot;June Days&quot;, as the Łódź uprising is known, a miniature civil war raged between &quot;Endecja&quot; and the PPS. As a result of the elections to the First Duma (legislative assembly in the late Russian Empire), which were boycotted by the PPS, the National Democrats won 34 of the 55 seats allotted to Poland. Dmowski and the &quot;Endecja&quot; saw the Duma as a way of improving Congress Poland&#x27;s position within the Russian Empire as he considered guerrilla war to be impractical. Dmowski himself was elected a deputy to the Second and Third Dumas (beginning on 27 February 1907) and was president of the Polish caucus within it. He was seen as a conservative, and despite being a Polish caucus leader, he often had more influence on the Russian than the Polish deputies. Between October 1905 and early 1906, over 2000 Poles were killed by Russian police or military and an additional 1000 were sentenced to death. Even though Dmowski was often denounced as a sellout, he maintained that he was undertaking the only realistic course of action for Poland under the circumstances.

Over time, Dmowski became more receptive to Russian overtures, particularly neoslavism, warming up to the idea that Poland and Russia may have a common future, particularly due to Germany being their common enemy. In light of what he regarded as Russian cultural inferiority, Dmowski felt that a strong Russia was more acceptable than a strong Germany. In Dmowski&#x27;s view, the Russian policy of Russification would not succeed in subjugating the Poles, while the Germans would be far more successful with their Germanisation policies. He explained those views in his book &quot;Niemcy, Rosja i kwestia Polska&quot; (&quot;Germany, Russia and the Polish Cause&quot;), published in 1908. This was not a universally popular attitude, and in 1909 Dmowski resigned his deputy mandate to focus on an internal political struggle within &quot;Endecja&quot;. He lost the election to the Fourth Duma in 1912 to a socialist politician, Eugeniusz Jagiełło from the Polish Socialist Party – Left, who won with the support of the Jewish vote. Dmowski viewed this as a personal insult; in exchange, he organized a successful boycott of Jewish businesses throughout much of Poland.

==World War I==
In 1914, Dmowski praised the Grand Duke Nicholas&#x27;s Manifesto to the Polish Nation of 14 August, which vaguely assured the Tsar&#x27;s Polish subjects that there would be greater autonomy for &quot;Congress Poland&quot; after the war and that the Austrian provinces of East and West Galicia, together with the Pomerania province of Prussia, would be annexed to the Kingdom of Poland when the German Empire and Austria-Hungary were defeated. However, subsequent attempts on the part of Dmowski to have the Russians make firmer commitments along the lines of the Grand Duke Nicholas&#x27;s manifesto were met with elusive answers. Nonetheless, Dmowski&#x27;s pro-Russian and anti-German propaganda succeeded in frustrating Piłsudski&#x27;s plans of causing an anti-Russian uprising, and bolstered his position as an important Polish political figure on the international scene, especially with the Triple Entente. In November he became one of the active members of the Polish National Committee.
In 1915, Dmowski, increasingly convinced of Russia&#x27;s impending defeat, decided that to support the cause of Polish independence he should go abroad to campaign on behalf of Poland in the capitals of the western Allies. During his lobbying efforts, his friends included such opinion makers as the British journalist Wickham Steed. In particular, Dmowski was very successful in France, where he made a very favourable impression on public opinion. He gave a series of lectures at Cambridge University, which impressed the local faculty enough that he was given an honorary doctorate. In August 1917, in Paris, he created a new Polish National Committee aimed at rebuilding a Polish state. That year he also published, at his own expense, &quot;Problems of Central and Eastern Europe&quot;, that he soon distributed among numerous English speaking diplomats. He was a vocal critic of Austro-Hungary, and campaigned for the creation of a number of Slavic states (including for the Czechs, as well as non-Slavic Hungarians and Romanians) in its place. Within the Polish political community, he opposed those who supported allying themselves with Germany and Austria-Hungary, including supporters of a vague German proposal for a Regency Kingdom of Poland, with undefined borders, that Germany promised to create after World War I (while in secret, actually planning to strip it of up to 30,000 square kilometres for German colonization after the removal of its Polish population).

In 1917, Dmowski laid out a plan for the borders of a re-created Polish state; it would include Greater Poland, Pomerania with Gdańsk, Upper Silesia, south strip of East Prussia and Cieszyn Silesia. In September that year, Dmowski&#x27;s National Committee was recognized by the French as the legitimate government of Poland. The British and the Americans were less enthusiastic about Dmowski&#x27;s National Committee, but likewise recognized it as Poland&#x27;s government a year later. However, the Americans refused to provide backing for what they regarded as Dmowski&#x27;s excessive territorial claims (Dmowski&#x27;s Line). The American President Woodrow Wilson reported, &quot;I saw Mr. Dmowski and Mr. Paderewski in Washington, and I asked them to define Poland for me, as they understood it, and they presented me with a map in which they claimed a large part of the earth.&quot;

In part, Wilson&#x27;s objections stemmed from the dislike of Dmowski personally. One British diplomat stated, &quot;He was a clever man, and clever men are distrusted; he was logical in his political theories and we hate logic; and he was persistent with a tenacity which was calculated to drive everybody mad.&quot; Another area of objection to Dmowski was with his antisemitic remarks, as in a speech he delivered at a dinner organized by the writer Gilbert Keith Chesterton, that began with the words, &quot;My religion came from Jesus Christ, who was murdered by the Jews.&quot; When British Prime Minister David Lloyd George criticized Dmowski and the committee, Dmowski saw this as a result of Lloyd George&#x27;s representation of Jewish interests. He refused to admit a single Polish Jew to the National Committee, despite support for such a proposal from Paderewski. A number of American and British Jewish organizations campaigned during the war against their governments recognizing the National Committee. Another leading critic of Dmowski was the historian Sir Lewis Namier, a Jew who served as the British Foreign Office&#x27;s resident expert on Poland during the war, and who claimed to be personally offended by antisemitic remarks made by Dmowski. Namier fought hard against British recognition of Dmowski and &quot;his chauvinist gang&quot;. In turn, Dmowski&#x27;s experiences at that time convinced him of the existence of an international &quot;Judeo-Masonic conspiracy, unfriendly towards Poland and intransigently hostile to his [&quot;Endecja&quot;] party&quot;.

==Post-World War I==
At the end of the World War, two governments claimed to be the legitimate governments of Poland: Dmowski&#x27;s in Paris and Piłsudski&#x27;s in Warsaw. To put an end to the rival claims of Piłsudski and Dmowski, the composer Ignacy Jan Paderewski met with both men and persuaded them to reluctantly join forces. Both men had something that the other needed. Piłsudski was in possession of Poland after the war, but as the Pole who had fought with the Austrians for the Central Powers against the Russians, he was distrusted by the Allies. Piłsudski&#x27;s newly reborn Polish Army, formed from his Polish Legions, needed arms from the Allies, something that Dmowski was much better suited to persuade the Allies to deliver upon. Beyond that, the French were planning to send the Blue Army of General Józef Haller – loyal to Dmowski – back to Poland. The fear was that if Piłsudski and Dmowski did not put aside their differences, a civil war might break out between their partisans. Paderewski was successful in working out a compromise in which Dmowski and himself were to represent Poland at the Paris Peace Conference while Piłsudski was to serve as provisional president of Poland. Not all of Dmowski&#x27;s supporters accepted this compromise, and on 5 January 1919, Dmowski&#x27;s partisans (led by Marian Januszajtis-Żegota and Eustachy Sapieha) attempted a failed coup against Piłsudski.

As a Polish delegate at the Paris Peace Conference and a signatory of the Versailles Treaty, Dmowski exerted a substantial influence on the Treaty&#x27;s favorable decisions regarding Poland. On 29 January 1919, Dmowski met with the Allies&#x27; Supreme War Council for the first time; his five-hour presentation there, delivered in English and French, was described as brilliant. At the meeting, Dmowski stated that he had little interest in laying claim to areas of Ukraine and Lithuania that were formerly part of Poland, but no longer had a Polish majority. At the same time Dmowski strongly pressed for the return of Polish territories with Polish-speaking majorities taken by Prussia from Poland in the 1790s, as well as for some territories beyond Poland&#x27;s pre-1772 borders, such as southern East Prussia and Upper Silesia. Dmowski himself admitted that from a purely historical point of view, ethnic-linguistic considerations aside, the Polish claims to Silesia were not entirely strong, but he claimed it for Poland on economic grounds, especially the coal fields. Moreover, Dmowski claimed that German statistics had lied about the number of ethnic Poles living in eastern Germany and that &quot;these Poles were some of the most educated and highly cultured in the nation, with a strong sense of nationality and men of progressive ideas&quot;. In addition, Dmowski, with the strong backing of the French, wanted to send the &quot;Blue Army&quot; to Poland via Danzig, Germany (modern Gdańsk, Poland); it was the intention of both Dmowski and the French that the Blue Army create a territorial &quot;fait accompli&quot;. This proposal created much opposition from the Germans, the British and the Americans, and finally the Blue Army was sent to Poland in April 1919 via land. Piłsudski was opposed to needlessly annoying the Allies, and it has been suggested that he did not care much about the Danzig issue.

In regard to Lithuania, Dmowski did not view Lithuanians as having a strong national identity, and viewed their social organization as tribal. Those areas of Lithuania that had either Polish majorities or minorities were claimed by Dmowski on the grounds of self-determination. In the areas with Polish minorities, the Poles would act as a civilizing influence; only the northern part of Lithuania, which had a solid Lithuanian majority, was Dmowski willing to concede to the Lithuanians. His initial plans for Lithuania involved giving it an autonomy within a Polish state. This caused Dmowski to have very acrimonious disputes with the Lithuanian delegation at Paris. With regard to the former Austrian province of East Galicia, Dmowski claimed that the local Ukrainians were quite incapable of ruling themselves and also required the civilizing influence of Polish leadership. In addition, Dmowski wished to acquire the oil fields of Galicia. His support for that was however more lackluster than that for other regions, and he opposed Piłsudski&#x27;s proposal of an alliance or federation with Ukrainians. From the Allied powers only the French supported Polish claims to Galica wholeheartedly. In the end, it was the actual fighting on the ground in Galicia, and not the decisions of the diplomats in Paris, that decided that the region would be part of Poland. The French did not back Dmowski&#x27;s aspirations in the Cieszyn Silesia region, and instead supported the claims of Czechoslovakia. Dmowski for a long time had praised the Czechs as model for national restoration in face of Germanization, and despite his dispute with Czech political leaders, his opinion of the Czech people as a whole remained positive.

Forever a political opponent of Piłsudski, Dmowski favored what he called a &quot;national state&quot;, a state in which the citizens would speak Polish and be of the Roman Catholic faith. If Piłsudski&#x27;s vision of Poland was based on the historical multiethnic state that had existed under the Jagiellonian dynasty, which he hoped to recreate with a multinational federation (Międzymorze federation), Dmowski&#x27;s vision was the earlier Polish kingdom ruled by the Piast dynasty, ethnically and religiously homogeneous. Piłsudski believed in a wide definition of Polish citizenship in which peoples of different languages, cultures and faiths were to be united by a common loyalty to the reborn Polish state. Dmowski regarded Piłsudski&#x27;s views as dangerous nonsense, and felt that the presence of large number of ethnic minorities would undermine the security of Polish state. At the Paris Peace Conference, he argued strenuously against the Minority Rights Treaty forced on Poland by the Allies.

Dmowski himself was disappointed with the Treaty of Versailles, partly because he was strongly opposed to the Minority Rights Treaty imposed on Poland and partly because he wanted the German-Polish border to be somewhat farther to the west than Versailles allowed. Both of these disappointments Dmowski blamed on what he claimed was the &quot;international Jewish conspiracy&quot;. Throughout his life, Dmowski maintained that the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George had been bribed by a syndicate of German-Jewish financiers to give Poland what Dmowski considered to be an unfavorable frontier with Germany. His relations with Lloyd George were very poor. Dmowski found Lloyd George to be arrogant, unscrupulous and a consistent advocate of ruling against Polish claims to the West and the East. Dmowski was very offended by Lloyd George&#x27;s ignorance of Polish affairs and in particular was enraged by his lack of knowledge about river traffic on the Vistula. Dmowski called Lloyd George &quot;the agent of the Jews&quot;. Lloyd George in turn claimed in 1939 that &quot;Poland had deserved its fate&quot;.

==Later life==

Dmowski was a deputy to the 1919 Legislative Sejm, but he attended only a single session, seeing the Sejm as too chaotic for him to exert much influence; he also spent much of that year either in Paris or recuperating from a lung infection, in Algeria. He reorganized &quot;endecja&quot; into a new party, Popular National Union (&quot;Związek Ludowo-Narodowy&quot;). During the Polish-Soviet War he was a member of the Council of National Defense and a vocal critic of Piłsudski&#x27;s policies. In the aftermath of the war, Polish eastern borders were similar, if somewhat smaller, from what became known as Dmowski&#x27;s Line.

When the time came to write a Polish constitution in the early 1920s, the National Democrats insisted upon a weak presidency and strong legislative branch. Dmowski was convinced that Piłsudski would become president and saw a weak executive mandate as the best way of crippling his rival. The constitution of 1921 did indeed outline a government with a weak executive branch. When Gabriel Narutowicz, a friend of Piłsudski, was elected president by the &quot;Sejm&quot; in 1922, he was seen by many among &quot;endecja&quot; as having been elected with the support of the parties representing the national minorities, with the notable backing of the Polish Jewish politician Yitzhak Gruenbaum. After Narutowicz&#x27;s election, the National Democrats started a major campaign of vilification of the &quot;Jewish president&quot; elected by &quot;foreigners&quot;. Subsequently, a fanatical nationalist, painter Eligiusz Niewiadomski assassinated Narutowicz.

He was a Minister of Foreign Affairs from October to December 1923 in the government of Wincenty Witos. That year he received the Order of Polonia Restituta from the government of Władysław Sikorski.

In 1926, in the aftermath of Piłsudski&#x27;s May coup d&#x27;état, Dmowski founded the Camp of Great Poland (&quot;Obóz Wielkiej Polski&quot;), though he would find himself more of an ideologue than a leader, as he was displaced by new, younger politicians. In 1928 he founded the National Party (&quot;Stronnictwo Narodowe&quot;). He kept publishing newspaper articles, brochures and books. With declining health, he mostly retired from politics by 1930. In 1934, a section of the youth wing of the &quot;Endecja&quot; found Dmowski insufficiently hardline for their taste and broke away to found the more radical National Radical Camp (known by its Polish acronym as the ONR). His last major campaign was a series of political attacks on the alleged &quot;Judeo-Masonic&quot; associates of President Ignacy Mościcki. 

His health condition was systematically deteriorating. Władysław Jabłonowski, who spent the summer of 1936 with him in Tłokinia, noted that Dmowski &quot;was neither eager to write, which he liked to do in the countryside, nor to go for long walks, which he was a great fan of; he preferred to sit for hours in the shade of trees.&quot; In 1936 his last - not counting reprints - journalistic articles appeared in the press. Writing was already tiring him a lot. He helped a little with editing his writings - subsequent volumes were published until 1939. At the end of 1936 he attended the funeral of his brother, Wacław, who was 6 years older than him. He was the only one left from the whole family. In the spring of 1937 he suffered a mild stroke and from then on he quickly lost his strength. In October of that year he appeared for the last time at a meeting of the Main Committee of the National Party. In March 1938, the president of the Party, Kazimierz Kowalski, obtained Dmowski&#x27;s permission to organize a series of demonstrations in connection with the Lithuanian crisis. In mid-1938, the Niklewicz family brought him to their estate in Drodowo, where he lived for another half a year. It was only vegetation now. He had no strength to walk, he lay or sat on the terrace.

==Death==
Right after Christmas, Dmowski suffered paralysis on the right side of his body and partial speech impairment. In addition, pneumonia occurred. He died on 2 January 1939, shortly after midnight at the age of 74. 

The National Party authorities wanted to embalm the body, but the Niklewicz family, clearly citing Dmowski&#x27;s wishes, did not consent to it. Roman Dmowski was buried at the Bródno Cemetery in Warsaw in the family grave. His funeral was widely attended, with at least 100,000 attendees; the Piłsudski&#x27;s legacy sanacja government snubbed him without any official representative attending.

==Political outlook==

===Theorist of nationalism===
From his early student years, Dmowski was opposed to socialism and suspicious of federalism; he desired Polish independence and a strong Polish state, and saw socialism and conciliatory federalist policies as prioritizing an international idea over the national one. Over the years he became an influential European nationalist thinker. Dmowski had a scientist&#x27;s background and thus preferred logic and reason over emotion and passion. He once told famous pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski that music was &quot;mere noise&quot;. Dmowski felt very strongly that Poles should abandon what he considered to be foolish romantic nationalism and useless gestures of defiance and should instead work hard at becoming businessmen and scientists. Dmowski was very much influenced by Social Darwinist theories, then popular in the Western world, and saw life as a merciless struggle between &quot;strong&quot; nations who dominated and &quot;weak&quot; nations who were dominated.

In his 1902 book &quot;Myśli nowoczesnego Polaka&quot; (&quot;Thoughts of a Modern Pole&quot;), Dmowski denounced all forms of Polish Romantic nationalism and traditional Polish values. He sharply criticized the idea of Poland as a spiritual concept and as a cultural idea. Instead Dmowski argued that Poland was merely a physical entity that needed to be brought into existence through pragmatic bargaining and negotiating, not via what Dmowski considered to be pointless revolts – doomed to failure before they even began – against the partitioning powers. For Dmowski, what the Poles needed was a &quot;healthy national egoism&quot; that would not be guided by what Dmowski regarded as the unrealistic political principles of Christianity. In the same book, Dmowski blamed the fall of the old Commonwealth on its tradition of tolerance. While at first critical of Christianity, Dmowski viewed some sects of Christianity as beneficial to certain nations, through not necessarily Poland. Later in 1927 he revised this earlier view and renounced his criticism of Catholicism, seeing it as an essential part of the Polish identity. Dmowski saw all minorities as weakening agents within the nation that needed to be purged. In his 1927 book &quot;Kościół, Naród I Państwo&quot; (&quot;Church, Nation and State&quot;), Dmowski wrote: &quot;Catholicism is not a supplement to Polishness; it is somehow rooted in its very existence and to an important extent it even forms its existence. The attempt to separate Catholicism from Polishness in Poland, cutting off the nation from religion and Church, would mean destroying the very existence of the nation. The Polish State is a Catholic State. This is not because the vast majority of its inhabitants are Catholics or because of the percentage of Catholics. From our point of view, Poland is Catholic in the full sense of the word, because we are a national state, and our people is a Catholic people&quot;.

In the pre-war years, the history of Poland was contested terrain as different ideological forces pulled Polish nationalists in opposite directions, represented by Dmowski and Piłsudski. Throughout his career, Dmowski deeply disliked Piłsudski and much of what he stood for. Dmowski came from an impoverished urban background and had little fondness for Poland&#x27;s traditional elitist social structure. Instead, Dmowski favored a modernizing program and felt Poles should stop looking back nostalgically at the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which Dmowski held in deep contempt and should instead embrace the &quot;modern world&quot;. In particular, Dmowski despised the old Commonwealth for its multi-national structure and religious tolerance. He saw the ethnic minorities in Poland (Jews, Belarusians, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians) as a direct threat to the cultural identity, integrity and ethnic cohesion of Poland, directly in competition with the Polish petit bourgeoisie (small bourgeoisie, aka semi-autonomous peasantry) with which he identified. Dmowski argued that good citizens should only have one allegiance to the nation, and there is no middle ground. In his ideal view of Poland there would be no ethnic minorities; they would either be polonized or forced to emigrate. The success of his nationalistic ideas, also adopted and propagated by nationalists in other countries (such as Lithuania and Ukraine) contributed to the disappearance of the tolerant, multiethnic Polish-Lithuanian identity.

Dmowski admired Italian Fascism. In the summer of 1926 Dmowski wrote a series of articles admiring Mussolini and the Italian fascist model, and helped organize the Camp of Great Poland (OWP), a broad anti-Sanacja front modeled on Italian fascism that was known for its anti-Jewish rhetoric and violence. Later he nonetheless tried to ensure that OWM would not blindly imitate the Italian or German models.

===Antisemitism ===
Dmowski often communicated his belief in an &quot;international Jewish conspiracy&quot; aimed against Poland. In his essay &quot;Żydzi wobec wojny&quot; (Jews on the War) written about World War I, Dmowski claimed that Zionism was only a cloak to disguise the Jewish ambition to rule the world. Dmowski asserted that once a Jewish state was established in Palestine, it would form &quot;the operational basis for action throughout the world&quot;. In the same essay, Dmowski accused the Jews of being Poland&#x27;s most dangerous enemy and of working hand in hand with the Germans to dismember Poland again. Dmowski believed that the 3,000,000 Polish Jews were far too numerous to be absorbed, and assimilated into the Polish Catholic culture. Dmowski had advocated emigration of the entire Jewish population of Poland as the solution to what he regarded as Poland&#x27;s &quot;Jewish problem&quot;, and over time came to argue for increasing harsh measures against the Jewish minority, though he never suggested killing Jews. He opposed physical violence, arguing for the boycotts of Jewish businesses instead, later supplemented with their separation in the cultural area (through policies such as numerus clausus). Dmowski made anti-Semitism a central element in Endecja&#x27;s radical nationalist outlook. Endecja&#x27;s crusade against Jewish cultural values gained mounting intensity in the antisemitism of the 1930s, but there were no major pogroms or violent attacks on the Jews in Poland until the German Nazis occupied Poland and made it their mission in 1939–1944. In his 1931 novel &quot;Dziedzictwo&quot;, Dmowski wrote: &quot;A Jewish woman will always be a Jew, a Jewish man, a Jew. They have another skin, they smell differently, they carry the evil among the nations&quot;. In his 1938 essay &quot;Hitleryzm a Źydzi&quot;, Dmowski wrote: &quot;The tool of the Jews was Wilson, who was concerned that the Allied troops did not cross the German border...Lloyd George stopped regions from becoming part of Poland as they were before: the great majority of our Upper Silesia, Malborg, Sztum and Kwidzyn, and also Gdansk. Lloyd George acted like an agent of the Jews, and nothing gave the impression that Wilson was any less dependent on them. The Jews, therefore, negotiated an agreement with German Freemasonry, who, in return for help at the conference on the border question, agreed to provide them with a leading position in the German Republic. Eventually, after the peace, the Jews worked for Germany and against Poland in England, American, and even in France, but especially stove so that Germany became less and less a German state and more a Jewish one&quot;.

For Dmowski, one of Poland&#x27;s principal problems was that not enough Polish-speaking Catholics were middle-class, while too many ethnic Germans and Jews were. To remedy this perceived problem, he envisioned a policy of confiscating the wealth of Jews and ethnic Germans and redistributing it to Polish Catholics. Dmowski was never able to have this program passed into law by the Sejm, but the National Democrats did frequently organize &quot;Buy Polish&quot; boycott campaigns against German and Jewish shops. The first of Dmowski&#x27;s antisemitic boycotts occurred in 1912 when he attempted to organize a total boycott of Jewish businesses in Warsaw as &quot;punishment&quot; for the defeat of some &quot;Endecja&quot; candidates in the elections for the &quot;Duma&quot;, which Dmowski blamed on Warsaw&#x27;s Jewish population. Throughout his life, Dmowski associated Jews with Germans as Poland&#x27;s principal enemies; the origins of this identification stemmed from Dmowski&#x27;s deep anger over the forcible &quot;Germanization&quot; policies carried out by the German government against its Polish minority during the Imperial period, and over the fact that most Jews living in the disputed German/Polish territories had chosen to assimilate into German culture, not Polish culture. In Dmowski&#x27;s opinion Jewish community was not attracted to the cause of Polish independence and was likely to ally itself with potential enemies of Polish state if it would benefit their status.

Dmowski was also a vocal opponent of freemasonry, as well as of feminism.

== Recognition and legacy ==
Dmowski is considered one of the most influential conservative politicians in the history of modern Poland, although his legacy is controversial and he continues to be a highly polarizing figure. He has been called &quot;the father of Polish nationalism&quot; and the &quot;icon of the contemporary Polish political right&quot; who, as a signatory of the Treaty of Versailles, played a critical role in the restoration of Polish independence after World War I. Conversely, he has been described as the founder of contemporary Polish antisemitism and criticized for his disdain for women&#x27;s rights. Dmowski&#x27;s life and work has been subject to numerous academic articles and books. Andrzej Walicki in 1999 noted that main sources on Dmowski are Andrzej Micewski&#x27;s &quot;Roman Dmowski&quot; (1971), Roman Wapiński&#x27;s &quot;Roman Dmowski&quot; (1988) and Krzysztof Kawalec&#x27;s &quot;Roman Dmowski&quot; (1996).

Suppressed in communist Poland, Dmowski&#x27;s legacy has been more widely recognised since the fall of communism in 1989. A was named after him in 1992. In November 2006 a statue of Roman Dmowski was unveiled in Warsaw; it led to a series of protests from organizations which see Dmowski as a fascist and an enemy of progressive politics; due to similar protests plans to raise statues or memorials elsewhere have been delayed. The political commentator, Janusz Majcherek, wrote in 2005: &quot;Instead of a modern Conservative Party, such as was able to modernize Britain or Spain, we find in Poland a cheap copy of the &quot;Endecja&quot;, in which an old-fashioned pre-war nationalism mingles with a pre-Vatican II Catholicism, united in its rejection of modernization and mistrust of the West&quot;. Both Jarosław Kaczyński and Lech Kaczyński have cited Dmowski as an inspiration. Lech, then the mayor of Warsaw, supported the erection of the Dmowski statue in 2006.

On 8 January 1999, he was honoured by the Polish Sejm with special legislation &quot;for his achievement for the independence of Poland and expansion of Polish national consciousness&quot;. The document honours him also for founding Polish school of political realism and responsibility, shaping Polish (especially the Western) borders and &quot;emphasizing the firm connection between Catholicism and Polishness for the survival of the Nation and the rebuilding of the State&quot;.

Dmowski was awarded several state awards: the Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (1923), Order of the Star of Romania and Order of Oranje-Nassau. He received honorary degrees from Cambridge University (1916) and the University of Poznań (1923). He refused other awards. On 11 November 2018 (100th anniversary of Polish Independence), he was posthumously awarded the Order of the White Eagle.

<text>The Thorn Birds is a 1977 novel by Australian author Colleen McCullough. Set primarily on Drogheda—a fictional sheep station in the Australian Outback named after Drogheda, Ireland—the story focuses on the Cleary family and spans 1915 to 1969. The novel is the best-selling book in Australian history, and has sold over 33 million copies worldwide.

The novel was also adapted into an eponymous television miniseries; during its 27–30 March 1983 run, it became the United States&#x27; second-highest rated miniseries of all time, behind &quot;Roots&quot;. Subsequently, a 1996 miniseries entitled &quot;The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years&quot; filled in a gap of 19 years in the middle of the novel. It was criticised for inconsistencies with the original series.

The novel was also adapted into a musical in 2009, &quot;The Thorn Birds Musical&quot;. In 2022, &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

==Plot==
The story begins in New Zealand on 8 December 1915, the fourth birthday of Meghann &quot;Meggie&quot; Cleary, who is the only daughter of Padraic (&quot;Paddy&quot;), an Irish farm labourer, and Fiona (&quot;Fee&quot;), his wife. Meggie is a beautiful child with curly red-gold hair, but receives little coddling and must struggle to hold her own in the family, which includes five older brothers at the time. Her favourite brother is the eldest, Frank, a rebellious young man who is unwillingly preparing himself for the blacksmith&#x27;s trade. He is much shorter than his other brothers, but very strong. Unlike the other Clearys, he has black hair and eyes, believed to be inherited from his Maori great-great-grandmother.

Paddy has a wealthy sister, Mary Carson, a widow who lives in New South Wales, Australia, on Drogheda, an enormous sheep station. One day, Paddy receives an offer from Mary of a job on her estate, so in 1921, the whole Cleary family moves from New Zealand to Australia.

In Drogheda, the family meets Ralph de Bricassart, a young, capable, and ambitious priest. As punishment for insulting a bishop, he has been relegated to a remote parish in the town of Gillanbone, near Drogheda. Ralph has befriended Mary Carson, hoping a hefty bequest from her to the Catholic Church might liberate him from his exile. Ralph is &quot;a beautiful man&quot;, and Mary goes to great lengths to tempt him to break his vows. Ralph shrugs off her attentions and ploys, and continues his visits. He cares for all of the Clearys and particularly cherishes forlorn little Meggie.

Frank&#x27;s relationship with his father, Paddy, has never been peaceful. The two vie for Fee&#x27;s attention. Frank resents the many pregnancies Paddy has caused her to endure. Fee, now in her 40s, reveals she is again pregnant; the two men quarrel violently, and Paddy tells Frank he is not his biological son. Fee, the daughter of a prominent New Zealand citizen, is revealed to have had an affair with a married politician. The result, Frank, was already 18 months old when Fee married Paddy. Because he resembles her lost love, Frank has always been Fee&#x27;s favourite child. After the argument with Paddy, Frank runs away to become a prizefighter. Fee gives birth to twin boys, James and Patrick (Jims and Patsy), but shows little interest in them. Shortly afterward, Meggie&#x27;s beloved little brother, Hal, dies.

With Frank gone and Hal dead, Meggie clings to Ralph de Bricassart, who has been her constant mentor and friend. As she grows into womanhood, some begin to question their close relationship, including Ralph and Meggie themselves. Mary Carson, motivated by jealousy mingled with Machiavellian cruelty, devises a plan to separate Ralph from Meggie by tempting him with a high place in the church hierarchy. Although her will of record leaves the bulk of her estate to Paddy, she quietly writes a new one, making the Roman Catholic Church the main beneficiary and Ralph the executor.

In the new will, the true magnitude of Mary&#x27;s wealth is finally revealed. Drogheda is not the centre of her fortune as Ralph and Paddy have long believed, but is merely a hobby, a diversion from her true financial interests. Mary&#x27;s wealth is derived from a vast multinational financial empire worth over 13 million pounds (about A$200 million in modern terms). The sheer size of Mary&#x27;s bequest will guarantee Ralph&#x27;s rapid rise in the church. She also makes sure that after she dies, only Ralph, at first, will know of the new will – forcing him to choose between Meggie and his own ambition. She also provides for her disinherited brother, promising all his grandchildren and him a home on Drogheda as long as any of them lives.

At Mary&#x27;s 75th birthday party, Ralph goes to great lengths to avoid Meggie, now 17 and dressed in a beautiful rose-pink evening gown. Later, he explains to Meggie that others might not see his attention as innocent. Mary dies later that night, and Ralph learns of the new will. He sees at once the subtle genius of Mary&#x27;s plan, and although he weeps and calls her &quot;a disgusting old spider&quot;, he takes the new will to her lawyer without delay. The lawyer, scandalised, urges Ralph to destroy the will, but to no avail. The bequest of 13 million pounds works its expected magic and Ralph soon leaves for Sydney to begin his rapid advance in the church.

Before he leaves, Meggie confesses her love for him and they share a passionate kiss, but Ralph pulls away because of his duties as a priest, and begs Meggie to find a suitable partner.

The Clearys learn that Frank has been convicted of murder after killing someone in a fight. Frank spends three decades in prison.

More tragedy follows: Paddy dies in a lightning fire, and son Stu is killed by a wild boar shortly after finding his father&#x27;s body. Meanwhile, Ralph, unaware of Paddy and Stu&#x27;s deaths, is on his way back to Drogheda after hearing of the fire. He suffers minor injuries when his plane bogs in the mud. As Meggie tends his wounds, their passion is reignited, but again Ralph rebuffs Meggie, and he remains at Drogheda only long enough to conduct the funerals.

Three years later, a sheep shearer named Luke O&#x27;Neill begins to court Meggie. Although his motives are more mercenary than romantic, she marries him because he looks a little bit like Ralph, and also because Luke is not Catholic and she wants little to do with religion – her own way of getting back at Ralph. She soon realises her mistake. After a brief honeymoon, Luke, a skinflint who regards women as sex objects and prefers the company of men, finds Meggie a live-in job with a kindly couple, the Muellers, and leaves to join a gang of itinerant sugarcane cutters in North Queensland. Before he leaves, he appropriates all Meggie&#x27;s savings and arranges to have her wages paid directly to him. He tells her he is saving money to buy a homestead; however, he quickly becomes obsessed with the competitive toil of cutting cane and has no real intention of giving it up. Hoping to change Luke&#x27;s ambition and settle him down, Meggie deliberately thwarts his usual contraception and bears Luke a red-haired daughter, Justine. The new baby, however, makes little impression on Luke.

Father Ralph visits Meggie during her difficult labour. He has come to say goodbye, as he is leaving Australia for Rome. He sees Meggie&#x27;s unhappiness and pities her. Justine proves to be a fractious baby, so the Muellers send Meggie to an isolated island resort for a rest. Father Ralph returns to Australia, learns of Meggie&#x27;s whereabouts from Anne Mueller, and joins her for several days. There, at last, the lovers consummate their passion, and Ralph realises that despite his ambition to be the perfect priest, his desire for Meggie makes him a man like other men. He returns to the church, and Meggie, now pregnant with Ralph&#x27;s child, decides to separate from Luke. She sleeps one last time with Luke to ensure that her child&#x27;s paternity will not be questioned, then tells Luke what she really thinks of him and returns to Drogheda, leaving him to his cane-cutting.

Back home, she gives birth to a beautiful boy whom she names Dane. Fee, who has had experience in such matters, notices Dane&#x27;s resemblance to Ralph as soon as he is born. The relationship between Meggie and Fee takes a turn for the better. Justine grows into an independent, keenly intelligent girl who loves her brother dearly; however, she has little use for anyone else and calmly rebuffs Meggie&#x27;s overtures of motherly affection. None of Meggie&#x27;s other surviving brothers ever marry, and Drogheda gradually becomes a place filled with old people.

Ralph visits Drogheda after a long absence, and meets Dane for the first time; although he finds himself strangely drawn to the boy, he fails to recognise that they are father and son. The long-imprisoned Frank is also finally paroled at this time, thanks to Ralph&#x27;s intercession, and returns to Drogheda a broken man. Dane grows up and decides, to Meggie&#x27;s dismay, to become a priest. Fee tells Meggie that what she stole from God she must now give back. Justine, meanwhile, decides to become an actress and leaves Australia to seek her career in England. Ralph, now a cardinal, becomes a mentor to Dane, but is still blind to the fact that the young man is his own son. Dane is also unaware of their true relationship. Ralph takes great care of him, and because of their resemblance, people mistake them for uncle and nephew. Ralph and Dane encourage the rumour.

Justine and her brother remain close, although he is often shocked at her sexual adventures and free-wheeling lifestyle. She befriends Rainer Hartheim, a German politician who is a great friend of both Dane and Ralph&#x27;s, and who falls deeply in love with her. Their friendship becomes the most important thing in her life and is on the verge of becoming something more when tragedy strikes.

Dane, who has just become a priest, is vacationing in Greece. While there, he goes swimming one day and drowns while attempting to rescue two women from a dangerous current. Meggie reveals before Dane&#x27;s funeral that Dane is Ralph&#x27;s son. Ralph dies in Meggie&#x27;s arms after the funeral.

Justine breaks off all communications with Rainer and falls into a depressed, hum-drum existence. Eventually, they renew their acquaintance on strictly platonic terms, until Rainer visits Drogheda alone to urge Meggie to help him pursue Justine&#x27;s hand in marriage. Justine, now the sole surviving grandchild of Fee and Paddy Cleary, finally accepts her true feelings for Rainer, and they marry.

==Thornbird myth==

The book&#x27;s title refers to the mythical &quot;thornbird&quot; that searches for thorn trees from the day it is hatched. When it finds the perfect thorn tree, it impales itself on a thorn and sings the most beautiful song ever heard as it dies. The myth alludes to the Parable of the Sower in the Synoptic Gospels and chapter 9 of the Gospel of Thomas.

In the front matter of the book, the myth is set out:

No sources have been found for this myth prior to the appearance of the book, although since then, it has been described in various nonscholarly sources as &quot;an old Celtic legend&quot;.

A different myth associates the European goldfinch with the title &quot;Thornbird&quot;, recounting that a goldfinch plucked a thorn out of Christ&#x27;s crown of thorns and blood splashed onto its feathers. The bird is said to feature in several paintings of children destined for the church.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; played a recurring role as a joke element in the TV show &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot;. During the COVID-19 pandemic, as he taped the show from his home, the book appeared on a side table. On different camera cuts, the book will appear again with adjusted titles, sometimes many at a time.

Former NFL offensive tackle D&#x27;Brickashaw Ferguson is named after &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; character Father Ralph de Bricassart.

<text>The Chengdu J-9 (Chinese: 歼-9) was an interceptor aircraft that was cancelled during development in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). It was proposed in 1964 by the 601 Institute (Shenyang) as a higher-performing alternative to the Shenyang J-8. Development was disrupted by the Cultural Revolution and frequently changing requirements; in addition, development was transferred to the 611 Institute (Chengdu). The program was cancelled in 1980.

==Development==
By 1964, the Chengdu J-7 was inadequate to perform long-range, high-altitude interceptions. The Chinese Aeronautical Establishment held a conference on 25 October to discuss future fighters. The 601 Institute had two proposals; a twin-engined &quot;scaled-up&quot; J-7 which became the J-8, and a higher-performing single-engined option that became the J-9. The J-9 was technically riskier; it was not based on an existing design, and the required engine - an afterburning turbofan generating dry and reheat thrust - did not exist in China. Shenyang developed a delta and a double-delta concept in 1965.

Development was officially approved following a Ministry of Aerospace Industry (MAI) conference on 12-17 January 1966 with the goal of either an air superiority fighter or a pure interceptor. This was revised on April 1 with new requirements for endurance, rate of climb, and significantly increased range. A development schedule was approved on April 12. Shenyang responded first with the J-9A-IV (a tailed delta with lateral intakes) and then the J-9B-V (a tailless-delta); the former was unable to meet requirements. The Cultural Revolution paused development. Development on the J-9B-V resumed in 1968. The goal of flying a prototype by the 20th anniversary of the PRC in October 1969 could not be achieved due to major development problems. MAI shifted work back to the J-9A-IV. In addition, development was transferred to Chengdu because Shenyang was now fully occupied with the J-8. Wang Shounan became the new chief designer.

The Ministry of Defense issued new requirements on 9 June 1970 - and slightly revised in November - for even greater range, speed, and altitude. Chengdu abandoned the J-9A-IV, and reworked the J-9B-V into the J-9B-VI. The J-9B-VI was a canard-delta with lateral intakes; a single ventral intake was rejected. The intended engine, the Woshan WS-6 turbofan, encountered development problems; a reverse-engineered Khachaturov R29-300 turbojet, to be called the WS-15, was selected as a less powerful alternative.

The requirements were revised in February 1975, calling for more range and an armament of four PL-4 air-to-air missiles. In November the State Planning Commission approved funding for five prototypes, with the first flight to take place in late-1980 or early-1981. However, the program was ended in 1980.

<text>The 2004 United States Senate elections were held on November 2, 2004, with all Class 3 Senate seats being contested. They coincided with the re-election of George W. Bush as president and the United States House elections, as well as many state and local elections. Senators who were elected in 1998, known as Senate Class 3, were seeking re-election or retiring in 2004. 

Republicans won six seats but lost two themselves, giving them a net gain of four seats. Five of the six gains came from Southern states. Conservative Democrat Zell Miller of Georgia, who campaigned for President Bush, chose not to run for re-election and Republican Johnny Isakson won his seat; Democrat Fritz Hollings of South Carolina chose not to run for re-election and was succeeded by Republican Jim DeMint; Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards chose not to run for re-election and Republican Richard Burr won his North Carolina seat; Democrat Bob Graham of Florida chose not to run for re-election, and his seat went to Republican Mel Martinez; and Louisiana Democrat John Breaux chose not to run for re-election and Republican David Vitter won his seat.

In South Dakota, Republican John Thune defeated the incumbent Senate minority leader Tom Daschle, marking the first and only time since 1952 that a sitting party leader lost re-election, as well as the only time that person was the minority leader. Republican Senator Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois chose not to run for re-election, and Democrat (and future president) Barack Obama won in a landslide, becoming the Senate&#x27;s only Black member and only the third popularly elected in American history and only the third elected since Reconstruction. Also, Republican Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado chose not to run for re-election and Democrat Ken Salazar won the open seat.

This was the third consecutive election cycle for Senate Class 3 where the Democrats either broke even or lost seats. This also marked the first time since 1980 in which a presidential candidate from either party won with coattails in the Senate. Additionally, these election results are tied with those of 1996 and 1998 as the highest number of Senate seats that the Republicans have held since 1920. Republicans would not make a net gain of seats during a presidential election year again until 2024.

==Results summary==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Summary of the 2004 United States Senate elections results
DeMint entered the general election campaign severely weakened from the primary fight, having spent most of his campaign funds. He stressed to the voters that he would follow conservative principles and provide an important Republican vote in the closely divided Senate. Democrats fared poorly in statewide elections in South Carolina, so Tenenbaum tried to make the race about issues rather than party identification. She attacked DeMint&#x27;s support of the FairTax proposal because it would increase the sales tax by 23%. The election victory by DeMint merely cemented South Carolina&#x27;s shift to the Republican column as the best candidate the Democrats could offer was soundly defeated by the typical 10 point margin.

== South Dakota ==


In the 2004 congressional elections, Daschle lost his seat to Republican challenger and former U.S. Representative John Thune in a bitterly contested battle. Thune prevailed by a narrow 50.6–49.4% margin, of 4,508 votes. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist visited South Dakota to campaign for Thune, breaking an unwritten tradition that one party&#x27;s leader in the Senate would not campaign directly for the other&#x27;s defeat. Daschle&#x27;s loss resulted in the first defeat of a Senate floor leader since 1952 when Arizona Senator Ernest McFarland lost his seat to Barry Goldwater. Daschle&#x27;s Senate term expired on January 3, 2005.

Throughout the campaign, Thune, along with Frist, President Bush, and Vice President Cheney, frequently accused Daschle of being the &quot;chief obstructionist&quot; of Bush&#x27;s agenda and charged him with using filibusters to block confirmation of several of Bush&#x27;s nominees to the federal judiciary. Thune also used moral values such as issues surrounding same-sex marriage and abortion to convince South Dakota voters that Daschle&#x27;s positions on such topics were out-of-sync with the state&#x27;s residents. The Republican candidate also drove home his strong support for the President while blasting Daschle for his vehement opposition to Bush. He attempted to sway voters by remembering that Bush won South Dakota in a landslide in 2000 and had a high job-approval rating among South Dakotans. His opponent, the Minority Leader, repeatedly argued that he was funneling money into South Dakota for vital federal highway and water pet projects.

Daschle responded to Thune&#x27;s claim that he was a partisan anti-Bush obstructionist by pointing to his action just nine days after the September 11 attacks when he hugged President Bush on the Senate floor following Bush&#x27;s address to Congress and the nation. He also hit back by alleging that Thune wanted to &quot;rubber stamp what the administration is doing.&quot; Daschle&#x27;s use of the video of his embrace of Bush forced the Republican National Committee to demand that the ad be pulled, claiming that it suggests that Bush endorses Daschle. Shortly following the airing of the ad, in a nationally televised debate on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Thune accused Daschle of &quot;emboldening the enemy&quot; in his skepticism of the Iraq War.

Daschle also noticeably relied heavily on the power of incumbency to win a fourth term. Some also argued that Stephanie Herseth&#x27;s election to the state&#x27;s only House seat hurt Daschle, as voters may not have been comfortable sending an all-Democratic delegation to Congress for the first time in decades. Accusations that Daschle was possibly considering no longer being an official resident of South Dakota was believed to have offended voters there. Others have analyzed that Daschle&#x27;s lengthy consideration and eventual rejection of a potential run for the presidency in 2004 took a toll on South Dakotans, who felt betrayed and used by Daschle as a result.

When the race began in early 2004, Daschle led by 7 points in January and February. By May, his lead minimized to just 2 points and into the summer polls showed a varying number of trends: either Daschle held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or Thune held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or the race was tied right down the middle. Throughout September, Daschle led Thune by margins of 2 to 5 percent while during the entire month of October into the November 2 election, most polls showed that Thune and Daschle were dead even, usually tied 49–49 among likely voters. Some polls showed either Thune or Daschle leading by extremely slim margins.

Thune was an aide to former Senator James Abdnor, the man Daschle defeated in 1986 to gain his seat in the Senate.

Daschle spent a great deal of time and energy campaigning for his fellow Democrat Tim Johnson in 2002, who barely defeated Thune by 524 votes. He argued that by re-electing Johnson, South Dakota would be better off because Johnson would help to keep Daschle Majority Leader. However, in the end, while Johnson won, other states voted for enough Republicans that Daschle was no longer majority leader. Furthermore, Thune&#x27;s whisker-close defeat in 2002 freed him up to run against Daschle in 2004. Had Daschle not put his considerable weight to re-electing Johnson, it seems likely that Thune would have beaten Johnson, leaving Daschle without a strong challenger for the upcoming election and making his re-election a certainty.




== Utah ==

Incumbent Republican Bob Bennett won re-election to a third term easily beating Democrat Paul Van Dam, former Attorney General of Utah and former Salt Lake County District Attorney.





== Vermont ==

Incumbent Democrat Patrick Leahy won re-election to a sixth term.





 





== Washington ==

Incumbent Democrat Patty Murray won re-election. She became only the fourth Washington senator to win 3 consecutive terms, just after fellow Democrats Warren G. Magnuson and Scoop Jackson.

Term limits became an issue in the campaign, as Democrats seized on Nethercutt&#x27;s broken term-limits pledge that he had made when he unseated Speaker Tom Foley in 1994. Nethercutt was also hampered by his lack of name recognition in the more densely populated western part of the state, home to two-thirds of the state&#x27;s population. Washington has not elected a senator from east of the Cascades since Miles Poindexter in 1916. Other important issues included national security and the war in Iraq. Nethercutt supported the invasion of Iraq, while Murray opposed it. Nethercutt was a heavy underdog from the start, and his campaign never gained much traction. In November, he lost by 12 points, receiving 43 percent of the vote to Murray&#x27;s 55 percent.



== Wisconsin ==

Incumbent Democrat Russ Feingold won re-election to a third term.

Republican businessman and army veteran Tim Michels insisted he had more real world experience than Feingold, someone he called an &quot;extreme liberal&quot; who&#x27;s out of touch with Wisconsin voters. Feingold attacked back by saying that any Republican would be a rubber stamp for President Bush. The incumbent had $2.2 million in the bank, while Michels had already spent $1 million in the primary and had only about $150,000 left.

When the NRSC was finally convinced in October that Michels had a shot, they pledged $600,000 for him.

On October 1, a poll showed Feingold leading 52% to 39%. In mid October, another poll showed Feingold winning 48% to 43%. A poll at the end of the month showed him leading 51% to 36%.
